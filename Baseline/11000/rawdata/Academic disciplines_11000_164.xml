[[File:Silverback.JPG|thumb|300px|Male "silverback" [[gorilla]]s are usually the alpha animal and may receive preferential treatment such as being groomed by other group members]]

In studies of [[social animal]]s, the highest ranking individual is sometimes designated as the '''alpha'''. [[Male]]s, [[female]]s, or both, can be alphas, depending on the species. Where one male and one female fulfill this role together, they are sometimes referred to as the alpha pair. Other animals in the same social group may exhibit deference or other species-specific subordinate behaviours towards the alpha or alphas.

Alpha animals usually gain preferential access to food and other desirable items or activities, though the extent of this varies widely between species. Male or female alphas may gain preferential access to sex or mates; in some species, only alphas or an alpha pair reproduce.

Alphas may achieve their status by superior [[physical strength]] and [[aggression]], or through social efforts and building alliances within the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Waal|first=Frans |authorlink=Frans de Waal|title=Chimpanzee Politics: Power and Sex Among Apes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsrhU2vV5PIC|accessdate=13 July 2011|edition=25th Anniversary|year=2007|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press|JHU Press]]|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=978-0-8018-8656-0|origyear=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual with alpha status sometimes changes, often through a fight between the dominant and a subordinate animal. These fights are often to the death, depending on the animal.

==Beta and omega==
Social animals in a hierarchical community are sometimes assigned ranks in [[ethology]] studies.

Beta animals often act as [[second-in-command]] to the reigning alpha or alphas and will act as new alpha animals if an alpha dies or is otherwise no longer considered an alpha. In some species of birds, males pair up in twos when courting, the beta male aiding the alpha male. It has been found that the social context of the animals has a significant impact on courtship behavior and the overall reproductive success of that animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.factiva.com/ha/default.aspx |title= Seizing the Opportunity: Subordinate Male Fowl Respond Rapidly to Variation in Social Context. Ethology |author= Wilson and colleagues|date=6 October 2009 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Omega (usually rendered ω) is an [[antonym]] used to refer to the lowest caste of the hierarchical society. Omega animals are subordinate to all others in the community, and are expected by others in the group to remain submissive to everyone. Omega animals may also be used as communal scapegoats or outlets for frustration, or given the lowest priority when distributing food.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Dutcher, Jamie Dutcher, James Manfull [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-8PAQAAMAAJ ''Wolves at our door: the extraordinary story of the couple who lived with wolves''] pp.89, 145&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Primates===
[[Common chimpanzees]] use strength, intelligence, and political alliances to establish and maintain alpha position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=M|last2=Gilby|first2=I|last3=Murray|first3=C|last4=Johnson|first4=A|last5=Wroblewski|first5=E|last6=Pusey|first6=A|date=2009|title=Alpha Male Chimpanzee Grooming Patterns: Implications for Dominance ''Style''|url=https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/sites/evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/files/Foster%20et%20al%202009%20Alhpa%20male%20chimapanzee%20styles.pdf|journal=American Journal of Primatology |volume=71|pages=136–144|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alpha males who solely use intimidation and aggression to keep their position often provoke dissent. Coalitions will eventually form, which at some point will topple the alpha male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Insights On Leadership From Chimp Alpha Male Behavior|url=https://gainweightjournal.com/insights-on-leadership-from-chimp-alpha-male-behavior/|date=2015-03-20|publisher=Renaissance Man Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=September 2018}} There have been rare cases where a group has killed the alpha male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Greshko|date=2017-01-30|title=In Rare Killing, Chimpanzees Cannibalize Former Leader|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/01/chimpanzees-murder-cannibalism-senegal/|publisher=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chelsea Whyte|title=Chimps beat up, murder and then cannibalise their former tyrant|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2119677-chimps-beat-up-murder-and-then-cannibalise-their-former-tyrant/|publisher=New Scientist|date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Common chimpanzees show deference to the alpha of the community by ritualized postures and gestures such as presenting their back, crouching, bowing, or bobbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chimpanzoo.org/african_notecards/chapter_11.html|title=ChimpanZoo Homepage|website=Chimpanzoo.org|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{verify source|date=August 2018}} Chimpanzees lower in rank than the alpha male will offer their hand while grunting to the alpha male as a sign of submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Noonan, PhD.|date=|title=Inside a Chimpanzee Community|url=http://www.conservenature.org/learn_about_wildlife/chimpanzees/chimp_community.htm|publisher=Canisius Ambassadors for Conservation}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bonobo]] society on the other hand is governed by alpha females. Males will associate with females for rank acquisition because females dominate the social environment. If a male is to achieve alpha status in a bonobo group, he must be accepted by the alpha female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kristina Cawthon Lang|date=2010-12-01|title=Primate Factsheets: Bonobo|url=http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/bonobo/behav|publisher=Primate Info Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Female bonobos use homosexual sex to increase social status. High-ranking females rarely interact sexually with other females, but low-ranking females interact sexually with all females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lin Edwards|date=2012-03-02|title=Female bonobos use homosexual sex to increase social status|url=https://phys.org/news/2012-03-female-bonobos-homosexual-sex-social.html|website=Phys.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gorilla]]s use intimidation to establish and maintain alpha position. A study conducted regarding the [[reproductive]] behavior of male [[mountain gorilla]]s (''Gorilla beringei beringei'') found further evidence that [[dominance (ethology)|dominant]] males are favored to father offspring, even when there is a greater number of males in a notably enlarged group size. The study also concluded that mating access dropped off less steeply with status; alpha, [[beta (ethology)|beta]], and [[gamma (ethology)|gamma]] showing  more similar mating success, compared to what had been previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoinski|first=T.S.|author2=Rosenbaum, T.|author3= Ngaboyamahina, T.|author4= Vecellio, V.|author5= Ndagijimana, F.|author6= Fawcett, K.|title=Patterns of male reproductive behaviour in multi-male groups of mountain gorillas: examining theories of reproductive skew|journal=Behaviour|year=2009|volume=146|issue=9|pages=1193–1215|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/beh/2009/00000146/00000009/art00002|accessdate=1 April 2012|doi=10.1163/156853909x419992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on the association of alpha males and females during the non-breeding season in wild Capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella nigritus) examined whether alpha males are the preferred mate for females and, secondly, whether female-alpha status and relationship to the alpha-male can be explained through the individual characteristics and or social network of the female.&lt;ref name="Tiddi2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tiddi|first=Barbara|title=Social relationships between adult females and the alpha male in wild tufted Capuchin monkeys|journal=American Journal of Primatology|pmid=21698660|doi=10.1002/ajp.20939|volume=73|issue=8|pages=812–20|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicated that alpha male Capuchin are the preferred mate for adult females. However, only the alpha females had strong interactions with the alpha males by virtue of a [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]] hierarchy among the females in which only the most dominant and strong females were able to interact with the alpha male.&lt;ref name="Tiddi2012"/&gt;

Researcher [[M.W. Foster]] investigated primates and found that the leaders were more likely to be those who did more for those around them instead of being determined by strength. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=M.W.|year=2009|title=Alpha male chimpanzee grooming patterns: implications for dominance "style"|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=2009|issue=2|pages=136–144|doi=10.1002/ajp.20632|pmid=19025996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canines===
In the past, the prevailing view on [[grey wolf]] packs was that they consisted of individuals vying with each other for dominance, with dominant grey wolves being referred to as the "alpha" male and female, and the subordinates as "beta" and "omega" wolves. This terminology was first used in 1947 by Rudolf Schenkel of the [[University of Basel]], who based his findings on researching the behaviour of captive grey wolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davemech.org/schenkel/|title=Schenkel's Classic Wolf Behavior Study Available in English|website=Davemech.org|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view on gray wolf pack dynamics was later popularized by the researcher [[L. David Mech]] in his 1970 book ''The Wolf''. He later found additional evidence that the concept of an Alpha male may have been an erroneous interpretation of incomplete data and formally disavowed this terminology in 1999. He explained that it was heavily based on the behavior of captive packs consisting of unrelated individuals, an error reflecting the once prevailing view that wild pack formation occurred in winter among independent gray wolves. Later research on wild gray wolves revealed that the pack is usually a family consisting of a breeding pair and their offspring of the previous 1–3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mech, L. David. |year=1999|url=http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/2000/alstat/alstat.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214072331/http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/2000/alstat/alstat.htm |archivedate=December 14, 2005 |title=Alpha status, dominance, and division of labor in wolf packs|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume= 77|pages=1196–1203|doi=10.1139/z99-099|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some other wild canids, the alpha male may not have exclusive access to the alpha female;&lt;ref&gt;Gary Greenberg and Maury M. Haraway. 1998. ''Comparative Psychology: A Handbook'', Published by Taylor &amp; Francis {{ISBN|0-8153-1281-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; moreover, other pack members as in the [[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus'') may guard the [[maternity den]] used by the alpha female.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=35993 ''Painted Hunting Dog: Lycaon pictus'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N.

In the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of the eastern [[United States]], '''balds''' are mountain summits or crests covered primarily by thick vegetation of native grasses or shrubs occurring in areas where heavy forest growth would be expected. 

Balds are found primarily in the Southern Appalachians, where, even at the highest elevations, the climate is too warm to support an [[alpine tundra|alpine zone]], areas where trees fail to grow due to short or non-existent growing seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Peter White, "Balds," ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  The difference between an alpine summit, such as [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] in [[New Hampshire]], and a bald, such as [[Gregory Bald]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]], is that a lack of trees is normal for the colder climate of the former but abnormal for the warmer climate of the latter. One example of  southern balds' abnormality can be found at [[Roan Mountain (Roan Highlands)|Roan Mountain]], where Roan High Knob (el. 6,285 ft/1,915 m) is coated with a dense stand of [[Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest|spruce-fir forest]], whereas an adjacent summit, Round Bald (el. 5,826 ft/1,776 m), is almost entirely devoid of trees. Why some summits are bald and some are not is a mystery, though there are several hypotheses.

==Types==
[[Image:Gregory-bald-northeast1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Clear vistas make grassy balds attractive to hikers]]
Two types of balds are found in the Appalachians:  

===Grassy balds===
'''Grassy balds''' are relatively blunt summits covered by a dense sward of native grasses. Two types have been identified: those completely covered by grasses and those with a scattered overstory of [[deciduous forest|mixed hardwood]]s with a grassy [[herbaceous layer]]. Grassy balds are normally found at the summit of hills, but can also be found on broad upper slopes.&lt;ref name="Peter White 2006"&gt;Peter White, "Balds," ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Species found here include mountain oat-grass (''[[Danthonia compressa]]''), sedges (''[[Carex]] brunnescens'' ssp. sphaerostachya, ''[[Carex]] debilis''  var. rudgei, ''[[Carex pensylvanica]]''), and [[forb]]s such as three-toothed cinquefoil (''[[Sibbaldiopsis|Sibbaldiopsis tridentata]]'') and Blue Ridge St. Johns-wort (''[[Hypericum]] mitchellianum'').&lt;ref name="vaDcr"&gt;

===Heath balds===
'''Heath balds''' are typically found along narrow ridges and mountain crests, and consist of dense evergreen shrubs.  While the formation of grassy balds is a mystery, heath balds are often located in areas where the soil experiences heavy drainage or is highly acidic, which would complicate the growth of large wooded plants.&lt;ref name="Peter White 2006"/&gt; 

Four general types of vegetation are found on heath balds:
* Evergreen shrublands of Catawba rhododendron (''[[Rhododendron catawbiense]]'')&lt;ref name = "vaDcr"/&gt;
* Mixed shrublands of Catawba rhododendron, mountain-laurel (''[[Kalmia latifolia]]''), and black huckleberry (''[[Gaylussacia baccata]]'')&lt;ref name = "vaDcr"/&gt;
* Deciduous shrublands of American mountain-ash (''[[Sorbus americana]]''), minniebush (''[[Menziesia]] pilosa''), and southern mountain-cranberry (''[[Vaccinium erythrocarpum]]'')&lt;ref name = "vaDcr"/&gt;
* Deciduous shrubland of smooth blackberry (''[[Rubus]] canadensis'')&lt;ref name = "vaDcr"/&gt;

==Origin and dynamics==

The character and distribution of Appalachian balds remained stable from the time the first naturalists explored the region, until forestry regulations no longer permitted annual pasturing of local cattle. How and why a summit develops into a grassy bald is unknown; they represent "an ecological enigma and a conservation dilemma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter D. |last=Weigl |first2=Travis W. |last2=Knowles |year=1995 |title=Megaherbivores and Southern Appalachian Grass Balds |journal=Growth and Change |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=365–382 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2257.1995.tb00176.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Weigl and Knowles note that "the presence of both rare, endemic plants and northern relicts requiring open habitat suggests a long evolutionary history" and offer a scenario in which grazing pressure of the giant herbivores of the [[Pleistocene]] retained the open [[tundra]] habitat as the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] retreated far to the north. With the arrival of the [[paleoindians]] and the disappearance of the [[megaherbivore]]s, grazing pressure was maintained by deer and elk, and then by the grazing animals of European settlers. Some recent studies have attempted to uncover the vegetation history of some balds through analysis of the soil's organic component, since grasses leave a characteristic [[carbon-13]] fingerprint.&lt;ref&gt;Knoepp, Jennifer D.; Tieszen, Larry L.; Fredlund, Glen G. (1998). ''Assessing the vegetation history of three Southern Appalachian balds through soil organic matter analysis''  Res. Pap. SRS-13. Asheville, NC: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Southern Research Station. 12 p&lt;/ref&gt;  While there is some evidence that grassy balds have natural origins, the forest quickly started to reclaim the balds once large-scale livestock grazing was eliminated by the creation of national parks and national forests.  Grassy balds such as [[Gregory Bald]] and [[Andrews Bald]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park|Great Smokies]] and the balds in the [[Roan Highlands]] are currently maintained as bald areas by the National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service.&lt;ref&gt;Peter White, "Balds," ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville:  University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The mountaintop meadows called the ''Southern Balds'' form a distinctive stretch for hikers of the [[Appalachian Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.asp?trailid=HGD044-001 Appalachian Trail: Southern Balds Section] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091518/http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.asp?trailid=HGD044-001 |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Battle Management Language''' ('''BML''') is the unambiguous language used to command and control forces and equipment conducting military operations and to provide for situational awareness and a shared, common operational picture.

It can be seen as a standard digitized representation of a [[commander's intent]] to be used for real troops, for simulated troops, and for future robotic forces. BML is particularly relevant in a network centric environment for enabling mutual understanding.

The need for common BML was identified by the U.S. Army's Simulation to C4I Interoperability Overarching Integrated Product Team (SIMCI OIPT) and was originally defined in a paper titled '''Standardizing Battle Management Language - A Vital Move Towards the Army Transformation''' published by the [[Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization]] in 2001 [http://www.sisostds.org/DigitalLibrary.aspx?Command=Core_Download&amp;EntryId=23273]. The same issues that have driven the Army to embark on this program also confront the other Services C4ISR and simulation systems, and future military operations.  Acknowledging the significant need for training in joint environments to support future operations, SISO and other BML development efforts have expanded to encompass Joint BML (J-BML) for all military branches and ultimately to more recent work on establishing a Coalition BML (C-BML) for all Services and multinational coalition members promoting interoperability among their C4ISR systems and simulations, and also among systems employed in real-world operations.

==Coalition Battle Management Language==
'''Coalition Battle Management Language''' ('''C-BML''', '''CBML''') is an unambiguous [[language]] to describe a [[Command intent|commander’s intent]], to be understood by both live forces and automated systems, for multi-national [[simulated]] and real world operations.  Following a meeting of subject matter experts at the Spring 2004 SIW, the [[Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization]] determined that a detailed evaluation of BML efforts at a coalition level was necessary and formally established a Coalition BML (C-BML) Study Group with Terms of Reference (TOR) identifying the following tasks:

• The Study Group shall conduct a Survey comprising as many international contributions applicable to the
Coalition BML effort as possible.

• The Study Group shall develop a plan for how these various efforts can contribute to a common Coalition
BML specification within a methodological framework.

• The Study Group shall formulate a set of Recommendations for a Coalition BML Product Development
Group (PDG).

The Study Group meetings involved a membership of over 100 persons from 11 different countries and their recommendations were presented at the 2006 Spring SIW conference [https://web.archive.org/web/20070125145808/http://www.sisostds.org/index.php?tg=articles&amp;idx=More&amp;topics=8&amp;article=331 Spring SIW 2006] where the decision was made to establish a formal C-BML Product Development Group [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927123012/http://www.sisostds.org/index.php?tg=articles&amp;idx=More&amp;article=439&amp;topics=102 C-BML Product Development Group] to develop an international simulation interoperability standard applicable to simulation systems, operational command and control systems, and also robotic systems.

The '''Census of Antarctic Marine Life''' (CAML) is a field project of the [[Census of Marine Life]] that researches the marine biodiversity of Antarctica, how it is affected by climate change, and how this change is altering the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scar.org/researchgroups/lifescience/CAML_Annual_Report_09.pdf CAML Annual report 2009] published by the [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://coml.org/projects/census-antarctic-marine-life-caml Program Description on CoML Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program started in 2005 as a 5-year initiative with the scientific goal being to study the evolution of life in Antarctic waters, to determine how this has influenced the diversity of the present [[biota (ecology)|biota]], and use these observations to predict how it might respond to future change. However, due to modern and extravagant changes within technology, we are able to witness and influence biodiversity reproduction and development. This enables us to gain further insight toward characteristics that allow such biodiversity to flourish within this barren desert referred to as the Arctic and Antarctic.

CAML has collected its data from 18 Antarctic research vessels during the [[International Polar Year]], which is freely accessible at [http://www.scarmarbin.be Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research Marine Biodiversity Information Network] (SCAR-MarBIN). The [http://www.scarmarbin.be/scarramsabout.php Register of Antarctic Marine Species] has 9,350 verified [[species]] (16,500 taxa) in 17 phyla, from [[microbes]] to [[whales]]. For 1500 species the [[DNA barcode]] is available.

The information from CAML is a robust baseline against which future change may be measured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scar.org/treaty/atcmxxxiii/ATCM33_ip047_e.pdf Agenda Item] [[Antarctic Treaty]] Consultative Meeting 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for European Integration Studies''' (Zentrum für Europäische Integrationsforschung, ZEI) is an interdisciplinary research and post-graduate education institute at the [[University of Bonn]], [[Germany]], based in its Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Law. ZEI has participated in research, policy advice, and dialogue between science and practice since its establishment in 1995. ZEI also offers [[graduate education]] and mid-career training opportunities to contribute to the resolution of unresolved issues of [[European integration]] and the shaping of [[Europe]]'s global role.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wissenschaftsregion-bonn.de/zentrum-integrationsforschung.html&lt;/ref&gt; ZEI directors are Prof. Dr. [[Ludger Kühnhardt]] and Prof. Dr. Christian Koenig.

==Background and Structure==
The [[Berlin-Bonn Act]] of May 29, 1994–dealing with the consequence of the move of Germany’s national political institutions from [[Bonn]] to [[Berlin]] - provided for the establishment of a "Center for European Integration Studies” (ZEI) and a "Center for Development Research” (ZEF) as central scientific institutions of the University of Bonn. On May 4, 1995 the Senate of the University of Bonn agreed to establish these two centers. The overall concept was formulated in consultation with the participating organs of the federal government and the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. It is based on an original proposal of the Senate of the University of Bonn from February 11, 1993. The Senate decision of May 4, 1995 is considered the founding date of the "Center for European Integration Studies" (ZEI) and the "Center for Development Research." (ZEF)

According to the founding resolution of the Senate of the University of Bonn of May 4, 1995, the tasks of ZEI are as follows: "ZEI will function as a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary institution aimed working on problems in the areas of political, legal, economic, social and cultural [[social integration|integration]] disparities in a regional and pan-European context. ZEI will conduct basic research in the conceptual area that encourages integration of research and to coordinate these efforts within the University and externally. ZEI is to take part in the solutions of concrete problems of integration by offering practical advice. All in all ZEI sees itself as a platform for the discussion of policy issues, a place to develop concepts, hypotheses and models. As an interface between theory and practice, ZEI focuses on institutional- and capacity-building in the field of integration research in Europe. ZEI can only realize its aforementioned goals through consistent openness to the public, through inclusion of guest researchers and through close cooperation with non-university institutions to integrate research, practice and integration of the [[European Union]].”{{cn|date=September 2011}}

==Research and Post-Graduate (Master)Education==
The Center for European Integration Studies (ZEI) provides future oriented research on unresolved issues of European integration and the global role of Europe. ZEI’s research and teaching emphasis on “Governance and Regulation in the EU” brings together two aspects whose critical interplay shapes the EU, its impact on citizens’ lives and its role globally. The work of ZEI - basically in the fields of political science and law -  is applied and linked with innovative knowledge transfer. The dynamic interplay between governance and regulation in the EU serves as the touch stone for research, teaching and consulting work conducted at ZEI.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zei.uni-bonn.de/about-zei?set_language=en&lt;/ref&gt;

ZEI offers postgraduate students an English-speaking Master in European Studies - Governance and Regulation.  An international faculty from across Europe guarantees highest scholarly standards, offering diverse methods and perspectives on politics, law and economics.

The '''Brazilian Center for Research in Physics''' ({{lang-pt|Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas}}, '''CBPF''') is a physics research center in the [[Urca, Rio de Janeiro|Urca]] neighborhood of [[Rio de Janeiro]] sponsored by the Brazilian [[National Council for Scientific and Technological Development]] (CNPq), linked to the [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Brazil)|Ministry of Science and Technology]]. CBPF was founded in 1949 from a joint effort of [[Cesar Lattes]], [[José Leite Lopes]], and [[Jayme Tiomno]]. Throughout its existence, CBPF became an internationally renowned research institution, organizing several international meetings and hosting many renowned physicists, like [[Richard Feynman]] and [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]. It was also the starting point of important Brazilian institutions, like the [[Instituto Nacional de Matemática Pura e Aplicada|National Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics]] (IMPA), the [[National Laboratory for Scientific Computation]] (LNCC) and the [[National Laboratory of Synchrotron Light]] (LNLS). Since its creation, CBPF has been one of the most important Physics research institutions in Brazil, and its graduate program ranks among the best in the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2726">'''Christian interpolation''' is a subsidiary category of [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|scribal interpolation in manuscript transmission]]. In [[textual criticism]] the term generally refers to the specific phenomena of textual insertion and textual damage to Jewish sources text during Christian scribal transmission, but may also refer to possible interpolation in secular Roman texts, such as the case of [[Tacitus on Christ]].

==Josephus==
{{main|Josephus on Jesus}}
Notable disputed examples in the works of [[Josephus]] include Josephus' sections on [[John the Baptist]], which is widely accepted,&lt;ref&gt;John the Baptizer and Prophet: A Sociohistorical Study - Page 39 1597529869 Robert L. Webb - 2006 "2.3 The Authenticity of Ant. 18.116-19 The authenticity of Josephus' narrative concerning John the Baptist has often been critically examined. While a few have rejected it as a Christian interpolation, most schoLars have accepted it."&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Jesus of Nazareth]], which is widely regarded as at best damaged.&lt;ref&gt; Josephus: The Essential Writings - Page 265  Paul L. Maier - 1990 "scholars have long suspected a Christian interpolation, since Josephus would not have believed Jesus to be the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Testament pseudepigrapha==
Notable examples among the body of texts known as [[List of Old Testament pseudepigrapha|Old Testament pseudepigrapha]] include the disputed authenticity of [[Similitudes of Enoch]] and [[4 Ezra]] which in the form transmitted by Christian scribal traditions contain arguably later Christian understanding of terms such as [[Son of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Nickelsburg, “Son of Man.“ in [[Anchor Bible Dictionary]] 6.138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Enoch-Metatron Tradition - Page 82 3161485440 Andrei A. Orlov - 2005 "The same interchangeability is observable in the titles “son of man“ and “chosen one.” Here ... 88 Some scholars believe that these chapters might represent later interpolation(s) and do not '83 G. Nickelsburg, “Son of Man.“ ABD 6.138."&lt;/ref&gt; Other texts suffering significant Christian interpolation include the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]],&lt;ref&gt; The Lamb Christology of the Apocalypse of John Page 87 316148164X Loren L. Johns - 2003 " 2.2 Testament of Benjamin 3:8 The same sort of Christian interpolation is evident in Testament of Benjamin 3:8, where, according to Howard Clark Kee, "the major text traditions include a Christian interpolation."53"&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sibylline Oracles]] and so on.

[[File:Brainmaps-macaque-hippocampus.jpg|thumb|The cerebral cortex, in this case of a [[rhesus macaque]] monkey, is the outer layer depicted in dark violet.]]
In [[anatomy]] and [[zoology]], the '''cortex''' ([[Latin]] for bark, rind, shell or husk) is the outermost (or superficial) layer of an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]. Organs with well-defined cortical layers include [[kidney]]s, [[adrenal gland]]s, [[ovary|ovaries]], the [[thymus]], and portions of the [[brain]], including the [[cerebral cortex]], the best-known of all cortices.&lt;ref name=a&gt;[https://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(07)01148-7]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable examples ==

* The [[renal cortex]], between the [[renal capsule]] and the [[renal medulla]]; assists in [[Ultrafiltration (renal)|ultrafiltration]]
* The [[adrenal cortex]], situated along the perimeter of the [[adrenal gland]]; mediates the [[Fight-or-flight response|stress response]] through the production of various hormones

* The [[cerebral cortex]], the outer layer of the cerebrum, plays a key role in memory, attention, perceptual awareness, thought, language, and consciousness. 
* [[Cortical bone]] is the hard outer layer of bone; distinct from the spongy, inner [[cancellous bone]] tissue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Bone?|url=http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Bone_Health/default.asp|publisher=The National Institutes of Health Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases National Resource Center|accessdate=31 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ovarian cortex]] is the outer layer of the ovarian and contains the follicles.

==Cerebral cortex==
{{main|cerebral cortex}}
The cerebral cortex is typically described as comprising three parts: the sensory, motor, and association areas. These sensory areas receive and process information from the senses. The senses of vision, audition, and touch are served by the primary [[visual cortex]], primary [[auditory cortex]] and primary [[somatosensory cortex]]. The [[cerebellar cortex]] is the thin gray surface layer of the [[cerebellum]], consisting of an outer [[molecular]] layer or [[Hippocampus anatomy#Hippocampus proper|stratum moleculare]], a single layer of [[Purkinje cells]] (the ganglionic layer), and an inner granular layer or [[stratum granulosum]]. The cortex is the outer surface of the [[cerebrum]] and is composed of [[gray matter]].&lt;ref name=a /&gt;

The motor areas are located in both hemispheres of the cerebral cortex. Two areas of the cortex are commonly referred to as motor: the [[primary motor cortex]], which executes voluntary movements, and; the [[supplementary motor area]]s and [[premotor cortex]], which ''select'' voluntary movements. In addition, motor functions have been attributed to: the [[posterior parietal cortex]], which guides voluntary movements, and; the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], which decides which voluntary movements to make according to higher-order instructions, rules, and self-generated thoughts.

Diphyodonts contrast with [[polyphyodont]]s, whose teeth are constantly replaced. Diphyodonts also differ from [[monophyodont]]s which are animals who have only one set of teeth that do not change over a long period of growth.{{cn|date=December 2013}}

In diphyodonts, the number of teeth that are replaced varies from species to species. In [[human]]s, a set of twenty deciduous teeth, or "milk teeth", are replaced by a completely new set of thirty-two adult teeth. In some cases [[hypodontia]] or [[hyperdontia]] occurs, the latter in [[cleidocranial dysostosis]] and [[Gardner's syndrome]]. In the [[hare]] the anterior incisors are not replaced but the posterior smaller incisors are replaced.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept used in [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]]. It refers to the two-level structure inherent to a [[sign system]], insofar as it is composed by two kinds of elements: 1) significant or meaningful, and 2) distinctive or meaningless.

==Theory==
''Double articulation''&lt;ref&gt;Occasionally also "double segmentation".&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the two fold structure of the stream of speech, which can be primarily divided into ''meaningful'' signs (like words or [[morphemes]]), and then secondarily into ''distinctive'' elements (like letters or [[phonemes]]). For example, the meaningful English word "cat" is composed of the sounds [k], [æ], and [t], which are meaningless as separate individual sounds (and which can also be combined to form the separate words "tack" and "act", with distinct meanings). These sounds, called [[phonemes]], represent the secondary and lowest level of articulation in the hierarchy of the organization of speech. Higher, primary, levels of organization (including [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and [[semantics]]) govern the combination of these individually meaningless phonemes into meaningful elements.

==History==
The French concept of ''double articulation'' was first introduced by the [[André Martinet]],&lt;ref&gt;André Martinet, ''Éléments de linguistique générale'', Colin, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1949. The English calque ''double articulation'' has been criticised as inaccurate and is often replaced by ''duality of patterning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3935606 | pmid=24587833 | doi=10.1515/langcog-2012-0014 | volume=4 | title=New perspectives on duality of patterning: Introduction to the special issue | year=2012 | journal=Lang Cogn | pages=251–259 | last1 = de Boer | first1 = B | last2 = Sandler | first2 = W | last3 = Kirby | first3 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Charles F. Hockett]] and other linguists, this duality is an important property of human languages, since it allows for the expression of a potentially infinite number of meaningful language sequences. Strictly speaking, however, such expressiveness follows from [[generativity]] or [[Productivity_(linguistics)|productivity]] (a finite number of components combining via rules to produce a potentially infinite arrangement of novel utterances), not of duality per se (one could have a system with 2 levels of the kind referred to as duality, and yet have only finite productivity. For further discussion, see [[figurae]], as well as [[Hockett's_design_features]], which treats productivity and duality as distinct essential properties of language.

[[Sign language]]s may have less double articulation because more gestures are possible than sound and able to convey more meaning without double articulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sedivy|first1=Julie|title=The Unusual Language That Linguists Thought Couldn’t Exist|url=http://nautil.us/blog/the-unusual-language-that-linguists-thought-couldnt-exist|website=Nautilus|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{original research|date=September 2017}}
'''Ethical issues of [[business communication]]''' is the process by which individuals exchange information between other individuals or groups of people. Throughout the process, effective communicators try as clearly and accurately to convey their thoughts, intentions and, objectives to their receiver. Communication is successful only when both the sender and the receiver understand the same information. In today's business environments, effective communication skills are necessary due to the highly informational and technological era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essentiallifeskills.net/goodcommunicationskills.html|title=Good Communication Skills - Key to Any Success|last=Hereford|first=Z|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of context, communication involves choice, reflects values, and has consequences. For better communication, understanding the obvious and the subtle issues relating to communication is necessary. Any company that aims to be socially and ethically responsible must make a priority of [[Communication ethics|ethical communication]] both inside the company and in its interactions with the public. In theory, many [[Consumer|consumers]] prefer to do business with [[Business|companies]] they believe are ethical which gives those ethical businesses an advantage in the market.

== Overview ==
Some of the vital characteristics of ethical communication are discussed below.

*'''Conveying the point without offending the audience''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/?term=communication|title=Online etymology Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While communicating with the audience, expressing the desired message to them in a significant manner is of primary importance. For instance, the employees in a company can be asked to increase their efficiency in a demanding manner whereas managers and executives will feel offended if the same tone is used on them. There are different ways to explain the exact things to them in a much smoother manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Meenakshi Raman, Prakash|title=Business communication|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0-19-567695-5|edition=2. impression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Maintain a relationship with the audience''':
Maintaining the same wavelength with the audience is very important for a communicator to ensure the audiences feel at home. Experienced communicators immediately build a relationship based on trust with the audience as soon as they start speaking. Great orators such as Winston Churchill and Mahatma Gandhi always were able to maintain a relationship with their audience because they were masters at striking the same wavelength of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogin|first=Mary Ellen Guffey, Kathleen Rhodes, Patricia|title=Business communication : process and product|year=2009|publisher=Nelson Education|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-17-650046-7|edition=3rd brief Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Avoid withholding crucial information''':

In the modern era, information is vital for all decisions. Hence, it is essential for any organization to be cautious when communicating with tvitalic. The related information should be absolute, and all crucial information must be conveyed appropriately. Purposely withholding crucial information might result in the public conceiving a bad image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=A. C. "Buddy" Krizan |title=Business communication|year=2006|publisher=Thomson South-Western|location=Mason, OH|isbn=0-324-37485-2|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Well organized value system''':
In order to ensure that this concept is successfully practiced and understood in an organization, a well-organized value system must be established throughout the organization by the top management. If an organization functions on the base of value systems common to both the top management and the employees, mutual respect between them will be present. A sound and healthy value system can make way for ethical communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jethwaney|first=Jaishri|title=Corporate communication : principles and practice.|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-806365-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Accuracy of information is necessary''':

Any information that is to be passed on must be true and accurate. Communicating without checking the truth of the information can be highly dangerous for the organization. Identification of the source and testing the information is necessary before communicating it.

== Summary ==
The work of an organizational communication professional consists in developing communication plans that seek to restore trust, not only in the organization but the leaders and in all the people who work for it, in verbally promoting ethical behaviors and generating spaces of communication that help support institutional values.

In this way, both managers and employees will be "on the same page," employees will feel heard and respected and will treat customers in the same way. Also, this will generate more loyalty on the part of the client and, therefore, more business. In addition, a business that communicates internally with ethics will most likely project that image in the business community, will seek to maintain good relations with the government and its most successful businesses.  Without the distractions and negative effects that can have the legal implications of running a business " ethically debatable," the organization will be able to concentrate its efforts on its employees, its products, and its clients.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6528">{{Distinguish|Euphemism}}
'''Euphuism''' is a peculiar mannered style of English [[prose]]. It takes its name from a prose romance  by [[John Lyly]]. It consists of a preciously ornate and sophisticated style, employing a deliberate excess of literary devices such as [[antitheses]], [[alliteration]]s, repetitions and  [[rhetorical question]]s. Classical learning and remote knowledge of all kinds are displayed. Euphuism was fashionable in the 1580s, especially in the [[Elizabethan]] court.

==''Euphues'' (1580)==
[[File:Campaspe.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''[[Campaspe (play)|Campaspe]]'' by John Lily, 1584]]

"Euphues" is the Greek for "graceful, witty". [[John Lyly]] published the works ''[[Euphues (1578)|Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit]]'' (1578) and ''Euphues and his England'' (1580). Both works illustrated the intellectual fashions and favourite themes of Renaissance society&amp;mdash;in a highly artificial and mannered style. The plots are unimportant, existing merely as structural elements on which to display conversations, discourses and letters mostly concerning the subject of love. Its essential features had already appeared in such works as [[George Pettie]]'s ''A Petite Pallace of Pettie his pleasure'' (1576), in [[sermon]] literature, and Latin tracts. Lyly perfected the distinctive rhetorical devices on which the style was based.

==Principles==
The euphuistic sentence followed principles of balance and antithesis to their extremes, purposely using the latter regardless of sense. John Lyly set up three basic structural principles:
#phrases of equal length that appear in succession;
#the balance of key verbal elements in successive sentences;
#the correspondence of sounds and syllables, especially between words that are already balanced against each other.

==Examples==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is virtue, yea virtue, gentlemen, that maketh gentlemen; that maketh the poor rich, the base-born noble, the subject a sovereign, the deformed beautiful, the sick whole, the weak strong, the most miserable most happy. There are two principal and peculiar gifts in the nature of man, knowledge and reason; the one commandeth, and the other obeyeth: these things neither the whirling wheel of fortune can change, neither the deceitful cavillings of worldlings separate, neither sickness abate, neither age abolish". (''Euphues, the Anatomy of Wit'')
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Is it not far better to abhor sins by the remembrance of others' faults, than by repentance of thine own follies?" (''Euphues, 1, lecture by the wise Neapolitan)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Can any treasure in this transitory pilgrimmage be of more value than a friend? In whose bosom thou mayest sleep secure without fear, whom thou mayest make partner of all thy secrets without suspicion of fraud, and partaker of all thy misfortune without mistrust of fleeting. Who will account thy bale his bane, thy mishap his misery, the pricking of thy finger the piercing of his heart" (Euphues)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"How frantic are those lovers which are carried away with the gay glistering of the fine face? The beauty whereof is parched with the summer's blaze and chipped with the winter's blast: which is of so short continuance, that it fadeth before one perceive it flourish". (Euphues' after-dinner speech to the 'coy' Neapolitan ladies on whether the qualities of the mind or the composition of the man are more worthy).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Time hath weaned me from my mother's teat, and age rid me from my father's correction". (Lucilla, considering her father's reaction in abandoning her fiance Philanthus for Euphues).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A sharp sore hath a short cure" (Euphues)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As they be hard to be won without trial of great faith, so are they hard to be lost without great cause of fickleness". (Euphues to Lucilla on the quality of 'fervency' in women).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But alas Euphues, what truth can there be found in a traveller? What stay in a stranger? Whose words and bodies both watch but for a wind, whose feet are ever fleeting, whose faith plighted on the shore, is turned to perjury when they hoist sail". (Lucilla to Euphues).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
Many critics did not appreciate Lyly's deliberate excesses. [[Philip Sidney]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]] castigated his style. 

Lyly's style, however, influenced Shakespeare, who satirised it in speeches by Polonius in ''[[Hamlet]]'' and the florid language of the courtly lovers in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]''; Beatrice and Benedick in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' also made use of it, as did Richard and Lady Anne in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. It was taken up by the Elizabethan writers [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]], [[Thomas Lodge]] and [[Barnabe Rich]]. [[Walter Scott]] satirised it in the character of Sir Piercie Shafton in ''The Monastery'', while [[Charles Kingsley]] defended ''Euphues'' in ''Westward Ho!''.

==Contemporary equivalents in other languages==
Euphuism was not particular to Britain, or a manifestation of some social structure and artistic opportunity unique to that country. There were equivalents in other major European languages, each of which was called by a different name: [[culteranismo]] in [[Spain]], [[Giovan Battista Marino|Marinismo]] in [[Italy]], and [[préciosité]] in [[France]], for example.

'''Form-versus-content humour''' is a type of [[humour]] in an [[:wikt:incongruity|incongruity]] between a statement's content and the way it is communicated makes it humorous. It is one of the basic techniques of [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How to Laugh Your Way Through Life: A Psychoanalyst's Advice |first=Paul |last=Marcus |publisher=Karnac Books |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[form and content|Form-versus-content]] humour can be delivered, for example, by presenting a message in a form that inherently defeats the ostensible purpose of the message, or in a form that is fundamentally incapable of carrying the important part of the message. The ''[[Jargon File]]'' gives an example of this type of humor: a red [[index card]] with GREEN written on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/h/hackerhumor.html |title=hacker humor |website=The Jargon File, version 4.4.8 |editor=Eric S.

'''Hill tribe''' ({{lang-th|ชาวดอย, ชาวเขา, คนเขา,}}, {{IPA-th|tɕʰāːw.dɔ̄ːj, tɕʰāːw.kʰǎw, kʰōn.kʰǎw}}) ([[Northern Thai language|Northern Thai]]: จาวดอย, คนดอย, {{IPA-nod|t͡ɕāːw.dɔ̄ːj, xōn.dɔ̄ːj}}; "mountain people/folk")&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;[http://www.thai-language.com/id/226017 English-Thai dictionary entry for "hill tribe"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tumsorn|first1=Maneewan|last2=Chansiriyotin|first2=Supaporn|title=Northern-Central Thai Dictionary (Revised Edition)|date=1986|publisher=Peace Corps/Thailand|location=Thailand|url=http://www.livelingua.com/peace-corps/Thai/Northern-Central%20Thai%20Dictionary.pdf|accessdate=5 June 2014|language=English, Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used in Thailand for all of the various [[ethnic group]]s who mostly inhabit the high mountainous [[Northern Thailand|Northern]] and [[Western Thailand|Western]] regions of [[Thailand]], including both sides of the border areas between Northern Thailand, [[Laos]] and [[Burma]], the [[Phi Pan Nam Range]], the [[Thanon Range]], the latter a southern prolongation of the [[Shan Hills]], as well as the [[Tenasserim Hills]] in [[Western Thailand]]. These areas are known for their often mountainous terrain which is in some areas covered by thick forests, while in others it has been heavily affected by [[deforestation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/archive/Thailand.htm Forest data: Thailand Deforestation Rates]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hill dwelling peoples have traditionally been primarily [[subsistence farmers]] who use [[slash-and-burn]] [[agricultural]] techniques to farm their heavily [[forest]]ed communities.&lt;ref name=Highlanders-Intro&gt;{{cite book|last=Geddes|first=W. R.|title=Highlanders of Thailand|year=1983|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Kuala Lumpur|editor=John McKinnon and Wanat Bhruksasri|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular perceptions that slash and burn practices are environmentally destructive, government concerns over borderland security, and population pressure has caused the government to forcibly relocate many hill tribe peoples.&lt;ref name="Border Lanscapes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturgeon|first=Janet C.|title=Border Landscapes: The Politics of Akha Land Use in China and Thailand|year=2005|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, hill tribes were also a migratory people, leaving land as it became depleted of [[natural resource]]s or when trouble arose.

A 2013 article in ''[[Bangkok Post]]'' said that "Nearly a million hill peoples and forest dwellers are still treated as outsiders—criminals even, since most live in protected forests. Viewed as national security threats, hundreds of thousands of them are refused citizenship although many are natives to the land".&lt;ref name=Thainess&gt;[http://bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/366720/time-ripe-for-whole-new-take-on-thainess Time ripe for whole new take on 'Thainess']&lt;/ref&gt;

==The term "hill tribe"==
In the 19th century, the tribes living in the mountain ranges were the largest non-Buddhist group in Thailand. Their mountain locations were then considered remote and difficult to access.&lt;ref name="Sukrittaya"/&gt; In Thai official documents, the term ''hill tribe'' (''Chao Khao'') began to appear in the 1960s. This term highlights a ''Hill and Valley'' [[dichotomy]] that is based on an ancient social relationship existing in most of [[Thai Highlands|Northern]] and [[Western Thailand]], as well as in [[Sipsongpanna]] and [[Northern Vietnam]]. For the most part, the [[Dai people|Dai]]/[[Tai peoples|Tai]]/[[Thai people]] occupied the more fertile [[intermontane basin]]s and the valleys, while the less powerful groups lived in the poorer, higher altitudes. This dichotomy was often also characterized by a master/[[Serfdom|serf relationship]].&lt;ref&gt;Kusuma Snitwongse &amp; W Scott Thompson eds. ''Ethnic Conflicts in Southeast Asia'', Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (October 14, 2005) {{ISBN|978-9812303370}}, pg. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, ''Highland Thais'' is a more recent term also used to designate groups living in the mountainous areas.&lt;ref name="Sukrittaya"&gt;Sukrittaya Jukping, ''Mae Khru Khong Chaat: A study of women teachers of Thai hilltribe children.'' University of Iowa, 2008, {{ISBN|9780549750161}}, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven major hill tribes within Thailand are the [[Akha people|Akha]], [[Lahu people|Lahu]], [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Hmong people|Hmong/Miao]], [[Yao people|Mien/Yao]], [[Lisu people|Lisu]], [[Palaung people|Palaung]] each with a distinct language and culture.

===The Akha===

{{main|Akha people}}

The Akha are closely related to the [[Hani people|Hani]] of China's [[Yunnan]] province.&lt;ref name=Hilltribe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hilltribe.org/akha/|title=The Akha|publisher=HillTribe.org|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known derogatorily in [[Thai language|Thai]] as the Gaw or the E-gaw. The Akha are one of the dominant cultural influences in the area. There are two to three million Akha and Akha-Hani in total, 70,000 of whom live in Thailand. The Akha speak a language in the Lolo/Yi branch of the [[Tibeto-Burman]] language group, but have no traditional written language.

Although many Akha, especially younger people, profess [[Christianity]], Akha Zang (The Akha Way) still runs deep in their consciousness. The Akha are a shamanic group that share the ancient universal archetype that the Goddess spins a universe where nature is not distinguished from humankind. They embody the essence of its consciousness into a holistic continuum where there is no dichotomy between themselves and the natural world. The Akha Way, a prescribed lifestyle derived from religious chants, combines [[animism]], [[ancestor worship]], shamanism and a deep relationship with the land. The Akha Way emphasizes [[rituals]] in everyday life and stresses strong family ties and the hymn of creation; every Akha male can recount his [[genealogy]] back over fifty generations to the first Akha, Sm Mi O. AFECT NGO ([http://www.akhathai.org akhathai.org]) is the oldest [[non-governmental organization]] for tribes in Asia helping to protect the deeply shamanic tribal culture. Akha Asia ([http://www.akhaasia.org akhaasia.org]) runs an Akha cultural school.

===The Lahu===

{{main|Lahu people}}

===The Mien or Yao===

{{main|Yao people}}

===The Karen===

{{main|Karen people}}

The Bwa G'Naw,({{Lang-ksw|ပှၤကညီကစၢၢ်ခိၣ်}}) known to many as Karen, and to others as [[Kariang]] or Yang, are one of the largest hill tribes in [[Southeast Asia]]. The total population of Karen people is unknown, since they are spread throughout Burma, Laos and Thailand, and no reliable census has been conducted in Burma since the 1930s. Population estimates range from 7.5 million to 14 million people. (The more conservative estimate makes their population equivalent to that of Switzerland). The approximately 320,000 Karen in Thailand comprise half of the country's total hill tribe population.

While the Karen still practice slash and burn farming as other hill tribes do, they differ in that they live in permanent villages at lower elevations and have been aggressive in developing environmentally sustainable terraced rice fields. These factors have allowed the Karen to better integrate themselves into Thai society.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

===The Hmong===

{{main|Hmong people}}

The Hmong are believed to have been the original inhabitants of the [[Yellow River Valley]] in ancient China. The expansion of the neighboring Chinese from the north, caused a disruption in the Hmong culture and forced them to migrate southwards to Laos and Vietnam to escape oppression and persecution. Over the centuries, many wars have been waged against the Chinese. Greatly outnumbered, the Hmong suffered heavy casualties.

The futile efforts to establish themselves as an independent people apart from the expanding Chinese led to their mass exodus further south of China, and eventually into Southeast Asia. From here, they made their way into the territories of the European colonies that later gained independence and became known as Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar. While the Hmong came to inhabit the hillside of Thailand because of helping the Americans fight the Vietnam War and lost, the country had always maintained its sovereignty from the colonists.

Today, the Hmong are located in the [[Thai Highlands]], although some are found elsewhere within the country. Among the hilltribes, the Hmong are becoming well integrated into Thai society as well as being among the most successful. The current population of Hmong in Thailand is estimated to be roughly 151,080.

The [http://www.hml.queensu.ca Human Media Lab (HML)] is a research laboratory in Human-Computer Interaction at [[Queen's University]]'s [http://www.cs.queensu.ca School of Computing] in Kingston, Ontario. Its goals are to advance user interface design by creating and empirically evaluating disruptive new user interface technologies, and educate graduate students in this process. The [http://www.hml.queensu.ca Human Media Lab] was founded in 2000 by Prof. [[Roel Vertegaal]] and employs an average of 12 graduate students.

The laboratory is well known for its pioneering work on [[flexible display]] interaction and paper computers, with systems such as PaperWindows (2004),&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; PaperPhone (2010)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and PaperTab (2012).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; HML is also known for its invention of ubiquitous eye input, such as Samsung's [[Galaxy S4|Smart Pause]] and [[Galaxy S4|Smart Scroll]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; technologies.

[[File:IEEE_Bell_medal_scan_-front_-NO_COPYRIGHT_APPLIES-.jpg|thumb|275px|The '''IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal''', awarded for meritorious achievements in telecommunications. (Photo courtesy: '''''IEEE''''')]]

The '''IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal''' is an award honoring ''"exceptional contributions to the advancement of communications sciences and engineering"'' in the field of [[telecommunications]].&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt;  The medal is one of the highest honor awarded by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers]] for achievements in telecommunication sciences and engineering.

It was instituted in 1976 by the directors of the world's largest  professional society, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), commemorating the centennial of the invention of the telephone by [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. The award is presented either to an individual, or to a team of two or three persons.&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/about/awards/medals/bell.html IEEE webpage: IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal], IEEE, Piscataway, N.J.  Retrieved June 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute's reasoning for the award was described thus:
{{quote|The invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 was a major event in [[Electrical engineering technology|electrotechnology]]. It was instrumental in stimulating the broad telecommunications industry that has dramatically improved life throughout the world. As an individual, Bell himself exemplified the contributions that scientists and engineers have made to the betterment of mankind.&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt;}}

Recipients of the award receive a gold medal, bronze replica, certificate, and an [[honorarium]].&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt;

'''Infant crying''' is the crying of infants as a response to an internal or external [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. Infants cry as a form of basic instinctive [[communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eEsyCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35&amp;dq=Infants+cry+as+a+form+of+basic+instinctive+communication#v=onepage&amp;q=Infants%20cry%20as%20a%20form%20of%20basic%20instinctive%20communication&amp;f=false|title=The Calm and Happy Toddler: Gentle Solutions to Tantrums, Night Waking, Potty Training and More|last=Chicot|first=Dr Rebecca|date=2015-12-03|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781473527591|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, [[newborn]]s are transitioning from life in the [[womb]] to the external environment.{{sfn | Walker| page = 210}} Up to 27% of parents describe problems with infant crying in the first four months. Up to 38% identify a problem with their infant crying within the first year.

==Physiology==
Crying may elicit the [[Valsalva maneuver|Valsalva reflex]]. This reflex negatively impacts [[breastfeeding|sucking]] [[Suction|pressure]]s and results in poor feeding. The [[cortisol]] levels will rise along with [[blood pressure]]. Increased blood pressure will have an effect on [[cerebral blood flow]], [[cerebral blood flow velocity]] and [[intracranial pressure]]. Increased pressures and velocity can lead to [[intracranial hemmorrhage]]. Prolonged exhalation may also cause some [[adverse effect]]s. Obstructed [[venous return]] and quick inspiratory gasp can occur. [[Foramen ovale (heart)|Foramen ovale]] shunting can occur.{{sfn | Walker | page = 210}} Adults can often determine whether an infant's cries signify [[anger]] or [[pain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeskind|first=P.

==Misconceptions==
Misconceptions regarding the purpose of crying in the infant are common among caregivers and medical personnel. These are usually determined by cultural mores and not by [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] explanations.

Accessed 23 Aug. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that infants have a need to cry to expand or exercise their lungs is not supported by research. This is because a healthy newborn infant lung's are able to contain a sufficient amount of air plus a reserve.{{sfn | Walker | page = 210}} Birth trauma is related to the amount of crying.

===Colic===
{{Main|Colic}}
The term 'colic' was defined in 1954 as: " crying for more than three hours per day, for more than three days per week, and for more than three weeks in an infant that is well-fed and otherwise healthy."&lt;ref name = roberts/&gt; Colic and excessive crying by infants is synonymous to some clinicians.&lt;ref name=Gri2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grimes|first1=edited by Frank Domino, Robert A.

==Maternal responses==
Crying in infants is associated with high stress levels and depression in mothers.&lt;ref name=AFP2015&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.aafp.org/afp/2015/1001/p577.html|last1=Johnson|first1=JD|last2=Cocker|first2=K|last3=Chang|first3=E|title=Infantile Colic: Recognition and Treatment|journal=American Family Physician|date=1 October 2015 |accessdate = 22 July 2017| volume=92|issue=7|pages=577–82|pmid=26447441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = hu&gt;{{cite journal|title=Maternal anxiety versus depressive disorders: specific relations to infants' crying, feeding and sleeping problems|first1=J.|last1=Petzoldt|first2=H.-U.|last2=Wittchen|first3=F.|last3=Einsle|first4=J.|last4=Martini|date=1 March 2016|journal=Child: Care, Health and Development|volume=42|issue=2|pages=231–245|doi=10.1111/cch.12292|pmid=26490836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = clara/&gt;&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=Fallon|last2=Seymour|first2=Monique|last3=Giallo|first3=Rebecca|last4=Cann|first4=Warren|last5=Nicholson|first5=Jan M.|last6=Green|first6=Julie|last7=Hiscock|first7=Harriet|title=Comparison of methods for recruiting and engaging parents in online interventions: study protocol for the Cry Baby infant sleep and settling program|journal=BMC Pediatrics|volume=15|issue=1|pages=174|year=2015|doi=10.1186/s12887-015-0502-9|pmid=26556032|pmc=4640160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive crying has also been linked to maternal "physical aggression" and "angry speaking". The burden of care of the mother, that is, mothers without assistance in caring for the infant, are more prone to physical aggression and angry speaking.&lt;ref name=clara/&gt; During evaluations of maternal depression responses to infant crying, sleeping problems are closely associated with excessive crying and may confound the conclusions of such research. Also, it is not always clear that when sleeping problems are associated with infant crying, whether the sleeping problems are descriptive of the mother or the infant or both.&lt;ref name = hu/&gt; Maternal stress is associated with excessive crying.&lt;ref name=Ia2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iacovou|first=M|author2=Ralston, RA |author3=Muir, J |author4=Walker, KZ |author5= Truby, H |title=Dietary management of infantile colic: a systematic review.|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|date=August 2012|volume=16|issue=6|pages=1319–31|pmid=21710185|doi=10.1007/s10995-011-0842-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on young children==
One definition used to study excessive crying in infants is crying for three or more hours per 24 hours. Excessive infant crying has been associated with a twofold increased risk of the overall problem behavior, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and mood problems at the age of 5–6. Excessive infant crying doubles the risk of behavioral, hyperactivity, and mood problems at the age of 5–6, as reported by their mother. Excessive crying is not the only factor in later childhood difficulties. Behavioral problems in childhood include the so-called regulatory problems, such as excessive crying, sleeping, and feeding problems, which occur in 20% of infants in multiproblem families. Excessive crying, whining and sleeping problems at 4–6 months are associated with decreased social development at 12 months.&lt;ref name=clara/&gt;

Several factors may contribute to, and partly explain, an association between excessive infant crying and later behavioral and emotional problems. During early infancy, the quality of the mother–child dyad can be considered to be a crucial vehicle for child’s healthy mental development. Both early maternal and early paternal reciprocity in infancy are predictive of social competence and lower aggression in preschoolers.&lt;ref name=clara/&gt;

Compared to other infants, excessive crying infants had a slightly lower birth weight and a slightly younger gestational age. Excessive crying infants more often had a single, lower educated mother, originating from a non-industrialized country, who reported more depression, a higher burden of infant care, and more aggressive behavior and had an authoritarian parenting style. Excessive crying was associated with a higher risk for hyperactivity/inattention problems, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, peer relationship problems, and overall problem behavior at the age of 5–6, as well as a higher risk for decreased pro-social behavior as reported by the mother. Excessive crying was also associated with mood problems as well as generalized anxiety problems at the age of 5–6.&lt;ref name = clara/&gt;

==Abuse==
{{Main|Abusive head trauma}}

===Normal crying===
The physical abuse of infants is related to crying.&lt;ref name = reij&gt;{{cite journal|title=Infant crying and abuse|first1=Sijmen A.|last1=Reijneveld|first2=Marcel F.|last2=van der Wal|first3=Emily|last3=Brugman|first4=Remy A. Hira|last4=Sing|first5=S. Pauline|last5=Verloove-Vanhorick|journal=Lancet |volume=364|issue=9442|pages=1340–1342|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17191-2|pmid=15474137|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crying may be related to the abusive head trauma in infants. This is the most common cause of child abuse death. Fathers are often the ones who shake the infant. Shaking may occur many times. This shaking can cause serious injuries in almost 50% of the time. Some caregivers are unaware that shaking the baby can seriously harm or kill the infant. This type of abuse is being addressed by efforts to educate parents and caregivers with educational flyers and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Parents' behavior in response to infant crying: Abusive head trauma education|first1=Hina|last1=Simonnet|first2=Anne|last2=Laurent-Vannier|first3=Wenlun|last3=Yuan|first4=Marie|last4=Hully|first5=Sakil|last5=Valimahomed|first6=Malek|last6=Bourennane|first7=Mathilde|last7=Chevignard|date=1 December 2014|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1914–1922|doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2014.06.002|pmid=25043922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention and treatment==
Infant crying is worse in the first few months of life, but improves as the child grows. A baby can sometimes be calmed by rocking gently, offering a pacifier, singing or talking softly, taking a walk with a stroller, or going for a drive in the car. If a baby won’t stop crying, it can be sick and seen by a doctor. Frustration and stress can be overwhelming for those with a crying infant. If caregivers feel as if they may lose control there are preventative measures that can be taken. The caregiver may benefit by calling a friend, relative, neighbor, or parent helpline for support. Another suggestion is to  put the baby in a safe place and walk away. The baby can be checked  every 5 to 10 minutes. 
Babies may be in danger if a person who is easily irritated or has a temper or history of violence cares for or watches the baby.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childmaltreatment/abusive-head-trauma.html {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When "normal" causes of excessive crying are ruled out, some caregivers adopt alternative and complementary treatments for excessive crying. Those practices include: 
* Eliminating milk products, eggs, wheat, and nuts from the diet of breastfeeding mothers
* Feeding infants fiber-enriched formula; not proven to be of benefit for most infants
* Counseling parents about specific colic-management techniques; not proven to be effective for most infants
* Infant massage; not proven to be effective or recommended&lt;ref name = roberts/&gt;

Those who realize that an infant can be in a situation where abuse is a possibility, support can be offered to give a parent or caregiver a break when needed. Education and understanding can let the parent know that dealing with a crying baby can be very frustrating—especially when they are tired or stressed, but infant crying is normal and it will pass. Parents can be encouraged to take a calming break if needed while the baby is safe in the crib. Others can be sensitive and supportive in situations when parents are trying to calm a crying baby.

'''International Women's Year''' ('''IWY''') was the name given to 1975 by the [[United Nations]]. Since that year March 8 has been celebrated as [[International Women's Day]], and the '''United Nations Decade for Women''', from 1976 to 1985, was also established.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/events/womensday/2010/history.shtml International Women's Day]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="choike1453"/&gt;

==History==
After years of work by the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] (CSW) to adopt a declaration to eliminate discrimination against women, in 1965, CSW began working in earnest to obtain passage of a declaration to secure women's human rights. Collating responses covering education, employment, inheritance, penal reform, and other issues, from government actors, NGO representatives and UN staff, CSW delegates drafted the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women]] (DEDAW), which was passed by the General Assembly on 7 November 1967.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|pp=891-892}} Once support had been garnered for the declaration, the next step was to prepare it to become a [[Treaty|Convention]]. Though there were delays, by 1972, when the [[United States Congress]] passed [[Title IX]], eliminating discrimination in education for any institution receiving federal funding, hope that passage could be secured surged.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|pp=893-894}} In the meantime, members of the [[Women's International Democratic Federation]] (WIDF) had long been pressing for an international women's year and conference to address women's inequality. As WIDF was designated as an observer and not a member of the CSW, they could not propose the event directly, but drafted a proposal. Persuading the [[Romania]]n delegate of CSW to present their proposal, it was seconded by Finland. In turn, CSW approved the proposal and submitted it to the General Assembly, which proclaimed 1975 as International Women's Year in December 1972.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=201}} The date was significant because it would take place on the thirtieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=123}} But there were problems with the conference. Initially Soviet women rejected the call for a conference and [[filibuster]]ed the negotiations, preferring to host their own conference in [[East Berlin]] that would not be subject to the UN structure.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=5}}{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=441}} As part of the [[Cold War]] politics, the United States then proposed that the conference not be limited to women, but should be gender neutral, because an all-woman conference would not be taken seriously.{{sfn|Teltsch|1974|p=43}} Finally, [[Mexico City]] agreed to host the conference, and CSW set about the tasks to prepare the "machinery" necessary to secure passage of CEDAW.{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=441}} [[Helvi Sipilä]], was selected as the Assistant Secretary General for Social Development and Humanitarian affairs and placed in charge of organizing events for the year.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|pp=893-894}}

==International==
===Mexico City===
The first [[World Conference on Women, 1975|UN World Conference on Women]] was held in [[Mexico City]] from 19 June to 2 July.&lt;ref name="choike1453"/&gt; The 1975 conference led to the adoption of the [[World Plan of Action]], as well as the [[Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace]].{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=6}} It led to the establishment of monitoring mechanisms such as, [[International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women]] (INSTRAW) and the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) and set in motion plans for follow-up conferences, the first of which would be held in 1980 in [[Copenhagen]]. It established the period of 1975 to 1985 as the [[United Nations Decade for Women|UN Decade for Women]], to enable progress and failures to be evaluated and resulted in urging that the [[CEDAW|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)]] be quickly ratified.{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=43}}{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=155}} The 1985 third conference in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], not only closed the decade of women, but set a series of member state schedules for removal of legislated gender discrimination in national laws by the year 2000.&lt;ref name=dowie&gt;Allison Dowie, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L5FAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9aQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2937,4035456 Dangers on the Road to Complete Emancipation], ''Glasgow Herald'', 22 October 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arvonne S.

Prominent attendees included [[Elizabeth Anne Reid|Elizabeth Reid]] and [[Margaret Whitlam]] of Australia.&lt;ref name="naa-fs237"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naa.gov.au/fSheets/fs237.html |title=International Women's Year, 1975 |work=[[National Archives of Australia]] |accessdate=15 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610130940/http://www.naa.gov.au/fsheets/fs237.html |archivedate=June 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''International Women's Year Tribune'' was also organised and attended by 4,000 women in 1975.&lt;ref name="choike1453"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.choike.org/nuevo_eng/informes/1453.html | title = 1st World Conference on Women, Mexico 1975 | work = Choike, [[Third World Institute]] |  accessdate =15 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Berlin===
The World Congress of Women was held in East Berlin as a part of IWY soon after the Mexico City event. It idealized women’s equality as the "true embodiment of the socialist conception of human rights".{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|pp=68-69}} The Working Group on Equal Rights, composed of experts on government and law from the [[East German Academy of Sciences]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]] and [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist United Party Central Committee]] rejected the notion that women's rights should fall under a separate area designated by gender, but instead should be governed by the United Nations Human Right's position.{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|p=79}} [[Angela Davis]] was one of the key guests at the conference, as was [[Hortensia Bussi de Allende]], former [[First Lady of Chile]].{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|p=81}} The state-sponsored program advocated women's solidarity in the national struggles to free women from oppression based on class, race and gender through state socialism.{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|pp=83-85}}

===Brussels===
The [[International Tribunal on the Crimes Against Women]] was planned as an event for IWY but was not held until 4 to 8 March 1976 in [[Brussels]], Belgium. Limited by funding strictures, the conference hosted 2000 women from forty countries. Speakers addressed economic exploitation and violence against women in its many forms. The most significant development to come out of the conference was the [[International Feminist Network]].{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=214}}

==Zionism controversy==
The 1975 conference was also notable for passing the first "Zionism is racism" resolution passed at any UN-sponsored forum, thus preparing the way for [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379]] in 1975 the following November.&lt;ref&gt;Text of resolution 3379:

:''TAKING NOTE of the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace 1975, proclaimed by the World Conference of the International Women's Year, held at Mexico City from 19 June to 2 July 1975, which promulgated the principle that "international co-operation and peace require the achievement of national liberation and independence, the elimination of colonialism and neo-colonialism, foreign occupation, Zionism, apartheid and racial discrimina as the recognition of the dignity of peoples and their right to self-determination".''; {{cite web |url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/761C1063530766A7052566A2005B74D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206052903/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/761C1063530766A7052566A2005B74D1 |archivedate=2012-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jwa.org/exhibits/jsp/general.jsp?&amp;imgfile=exhibits%2Fimages%2Fexhban7.gif&amp;media_id=abamexic&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement equating Zionism with racism was also included in an annex to a report to be considered at the final conference of the United Nations Decade for Women in 1985 in Nairobi, Kenya.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;Sam Roberts, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/us/bernice-tannenbaum-who-fought-un-resolution-on-zionism-dies-at-101.html?_r=0 "Bernice Tannenbaum, Who Fought U.N. Resolution on Zionism, Dies at 101"], 9 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as stated in ''It Takes a Dream: The Story of Hadassah'' (1997), by Marlin Levin, "[[Bernice Tannenbaum|Bernice]] asked [President Ronald] Reagan to publicly repudiate the U.N. resolution. He agreed and promised that the U.S. delegation would walk out of Nairobi if the Zionism-equals-racism resolution was included in the final conference declaration."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Tannenbaum also convinced the United States Senate to condemn the conference resolution and demand its withdrawal.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; She also personally flew to Kenya with a draft of the Senate resolution, where [[Maureen Reagan]], President Reagan's daughter and the head of the American delegation, repeated the president’s promise to withdraw from the conference if the resolution was included in the final conference delegation.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Kenya then brokered a compromise in which Zionism was omitted from the final conference report.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

==National==
===Australia===
A conference on 'Women and Politics' was held in September,&lt;ref name="naa-fs237"/&gt; attended by 700 women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/occa_lect/transcripts/290906/index.htm | author = [[Marian Sawer]] | title = Red, White and Blue, What Do They Mean to You? The Significance of Political Colours |date= 29 September 2006 | accessdate =15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The events of IWY in Canada as a whole raised awareness with Canadian women as well as the general public on a wide range of women’s issues and accomplishments. It spurred creation of the Ontario Women and the Law Association and the Service, Office and Retail Workers Union of Canada (SORWUC) and offered funding for many to participate in educational and artistic endeavors aimed at presenting women’s perspectives. One such effort was a petition to the [[National Film Board of Canada]] which led to the creation of Studio D. The [[University of Guelph]] hosted a conference in September dedicated to [[Nellie McClung]] and the reform issues which had been important to her.{{sfn|Pierson|Cohen|1993|p=362}}

===New Zealand===
In June a United Women's Convention was held in [[Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.democrit.net/IWY/Forum1975.htm |title=Forum 1975 |accessdate=15 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928170942/http://www.democrit.net/IWY/Forum1975.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===
Events in support of IWY were held throughout the United States by private organizations and NGOs, such as those held in [[Connecticut]], 11–12 June 1977 and the ''[[Greater Cleveland]] Congress'', October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.lib.uconn.edu/online/research/speclib/ASC/findaids/IWY/MSS19860003.html | title = International Women's Year Conference Records | work = Thomas J.

The [[1977 National Women's Conference]] included women from each state in the United States and developed a National Plan of Action, mirroring many of the points of the World Plan of Action.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=215}}

== Outcomes ==
{{Main|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3520|Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace}}
As a result of the international focus on Women in 1975, a number of institutions were established:
* [[International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women]] (INSTRAW)
* [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM)
* [[Women's Studies Resource Centre]] was established in [[South Australia]] during July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=677 | title = Women's Movement page 6 | work = ''[[South Australia|SM]] Memory'', [[State Library of South Australia]] | accessdate =15 July  2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emblem==

[[File:PriestleyHistoryLectures.jpg|right|thumb|Title page from [[Joseph Priestley]]'s ''Lectures'']]

'''''Lectures on History and General Policy''''' (1788) is the published version of a set of lectures on history and government given by the 18th-century British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]] to the students of [[Warrington Academy]].

The ''Lectures'' cover an array of topics—"forms of government, the feudal system, the rise of corporations, law, agriculture, commerce, the arts, finance and taxation, colonies, manners, population, war and peace"—demonstrating how all-encompassing Priestley believed the study of history to be.&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley offers a version of history in which all events are "an exhibition of the ways of God;" studying history and nature, according to Priestley, "leads us to the knowledge of his perfections and of his will."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in McLachlan, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding history thus allows one to comprehend the natural laws God established and the perfection towards which they allow the world to tend. This [[Millennialism|millennial]] outlook is tied together with Priestley's belief in scientific progress and the improvement of the human race. Priestley maintained that each age improves upon the previous and studying history allows people to see and participate in that progress.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley's millennial conception of history was in direct contrast to the two dominant historical paradigms of the time: [[Edward Gibbon]]'s decline narrative found in the ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' and [[David Hume]]'s cyclical narrative found in his ''[[History of England (Hume)|History of England]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical underpinning of Priestley's [[millennialism|millennial]] view of history was [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley's]] theory of association laid out in ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749). Hartley's [[Association of Ideas|associationism]], an expansion of [[John Locke]]'s theories in ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690, postulated that the human mind operated according to natural laws and that the most important law for the formation of the self was "associationism." For Hartley, associationism was a physical process: vibrations in the physical world travelled through the nerves attached to people's sense organs and ended up in their brains. The brain connected the vibrations of whatever sensory input it was receiving with whatever feelings or ideas that the brain was simultaneously "thinking." These "associations" were impossible to avoid, formed as they were simply by experiencing the world; they were also the foundation of a person's character. Locke famously warns against letting "a foolish maid" convince a child that "goblins and sprites" are associated with the darkness, for "darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Ed. [[Roger Woolhouse]]. New York: Penguin Books (1997), 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Associationism provided the scientific basis for Priestley's belief that man is "perfectible" and served as the foundation for all of his pedagogical innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 87; 93; Sheps, 137-9; 147-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Priestley viewed education as one of the primary forces shaping a person's character as well as the basis of morality, he, unusually for his time, promoted the education of women. Alluding to the language of Locke's ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', he wrote: "certainly, the minds of women are capable of the same improvement, and the same furniture, as those of men."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Watts, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that if women were to care for children and be intellectually stimulating companions for their husbands, they had to be well-educated. Although Priestley advocated education for middle-class women, he did not extend this logic to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley also presented a method for historical research and was one of the first to argue for the primacy of original documents in the study of history. He contended that much could be learned from "material evidence" of former civilisations, such as "ancient coins, medals and inscriptions," as well as "exchequer rolls, public and private ledger books, letters, diaries, monetary, financial and exchange systems, systems of fortifications and city plans . . . [in addition to] ballads and works of fiction."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 254-5; McLachlan, 256; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lectures'' was well received and was employed by many educational institutions, such as the Dissenting academy at Hackney,&lt;!-- Is New College at Hackney the same as [[Homerton College, Cambridge]]? --&gt; [[Brown University|Brown]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 259; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of notable [[codex|codices]]. 

For the purposes of this compilation, as in [[philology]], a "[[codex]]" is a [[manuscript]] book published from the [[late Antiquity]] period through the [[Middle Ages]]. (The majority of the books in both the [[list of manuscripts]] and [[list of illuminated manuscripts]] are codices.) More modern works that include "codex" as part of their name are not listed here. The following codices are usually named for their most famous resting-places, such as a city or library.

The '''Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to furthering the education of residents of the state of [[Louisiana]].  In its [[Mission statement|mission]], the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities provides access to and promotes an appreciation of the history of Louisiana and its literary and [[cultural history]].&lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Statement|url=http://www.leh.org/our-mission/|website=Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1972 as a result of initial funding by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref name="NEHfounding"&gt;{{cite web|title=Initial funding of state humanities councils by the NEH|url=http://www.neh.gov/about/history/timeline|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding and history==
Beginning in 1971, the National Endowment for the Humanities initiated an experimental [[adult education]] program to various states, consisting of grants to the states to promote state-based programs of informal adult education in the humanities.&lt;ref name="TP1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Grants Given for Education: Louisiana Among Group in Humanities|publisher=''[[The Times-Picayune]]''|date=July 5, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities came into existence in 1972, as the 17th program of its kind in the United States.  Initially, the Louisiana Committee for the Humanities administered the program, as the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities was becoming a formalized institution.  It is one of more than fifty [[List of state humanities councils|state humanities councils]] established to give individual states greater autonomy in the [[humanities]].

The Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities has been headquartered at Turners' Hall in the [[New Orleans Central Business District|Central Business District of New Orleans]] since 2007.  Its location in this building is historically significant because of the construction of this building in 1868 by the [[Turners|Society of Turners]] as a [[social club]] for [[German-American]] citizens.&lt;ref name="Turners' Hall"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Turners' Hall|url=http://www.leh.org/lhc/|website=Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and publications==

During the period 2008 to 2012, the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities in partnership with the National Endowment for the Humanities funded $6.4 million in projects to institutions and individuals to preserve the cultural heritage of Louisiana.&lt;ref name="NEH2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Talking Points: Louisiana|url=http://www.neh.gov/news/talking-point/louisiana|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization funds programs of types including: discussions, documentaries, digital media, exhibition development, festivals pertinent to Louisiana's cultural heritage, publications, and scholar-in-residence programs.

The Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities administers the Louisiana Humanist of the Year Award.&lt;ref name="Awards"&gt;{{cite web|title=LEH Humanities Awards|url=http://www.leh.org/humanities-awards/|website=Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some representative winners of this award are listed in the table.  Other awards administered by the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities include, and are not limited to:  the Champion of Culture Award, the Humanities Book Award, the Humanities Documentary Film Award, and the Light Up for Literacy Award.&lt;ref name="Awards" /&gt;  Criteria for each award are articulated for purposes of nominations.&lt;ref name="Drum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nominations accepted for the 2015 Humanities Awards|url=http://www.thedrumnewspaper.info/?p=2863|website=The Drum Newspaper|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Malaysian Physics Institute''' (''Institut Fizik Malaysia'' or '''IFM''') is the sole representative body for physicists and for those involved in the practice of [[physics]] or physics related work in [[Malaysia]].

==Objectives==
# promotion of the advancement of physics.
# promotion of activities that will bring together members to co-operate in the fields of education, training and practice of physics
# elevation of the professional status of physicist.

==History==
The need for a single body to represent the growing number of physicists in the country was felt by many since the early sixties. Although most physicists in the universities were member of the [[Institute of Physics|UK Institute of Physics]] (IOP), the majority of physicists, especially teachers and those in the research and service sectors, were not.
The first interim committee met in [[Kuala Lumpur]] in 1971. The Institute's constitution was later formally approved and IFM was thus established in 1973 with an initial membership of 35. Although the growth of the Institute was initially slow, by 2009 the number of members exceeded 1200, reflecting the continuing acceptance and support of the Institute by the country's physics community.

==Activities==
IFM organises conferences, seminars courses, workshops and meetings on issues which are not only of current interest to physicists, but also on issues which highlight the important role of physics in the country's development. The National Physics Symposium is held once every two years. Here physicists meet to discuss issues pertaining to the many areas of physics. International and regional meetings are also organised. Special courses are held from time to time, e.g. courses on microcomputers, lasers, plasmas, etc.

The Institute publishes a quarterly journal (''JURNAL FIZIK MALAYSIA'')[http://ifm.org.my/jurnal-fizik-malaysia] to report up-to-date research findings in physics. A newsletter, ''BERITA FIZIK'', is published quartely to report current and future activities of the Institute. A magazine, ''MAJALAH FIZIK'', is biannual and contains popular articles.

==Associations==
The IFM is a member and associate of multiple Associations:
* A member entity of the Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics (APCTP),
* A member of the Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies (AAPPS).
* A member of the Confederation of Scientific and Technological Associations in Malaysia (COSTAM).
* An associate member of the Asia Oceania Forum for Synchrotron Radiation Research

IFM also cooperates with most other physics institutes/organisations of other countries.

The '''Medicina Radio Observatory''' is an astronomical observatory located 30&amp;nbsp;km from [[Bologna, Italy]]. It is operated by the Institute for Radio Astronomy of the [[INAF|National Institute for Astrophysics]] (INAF) of the government of Italy.

The site includes:
* 32-metre diameter [[parabolic antenna]] for observing between 1.4 and 23 [[GHz]]. The 32-m antenna is used as a single-dish instrument for [[astrophysical]] observations (such as water and [[methanol]] [[maser]] [[spectroscopy]]), [[SETI]] experiments and radar monitoring of [[Near Earth Objects]]. In  [[interferometric]] mode it functions as a [[VLBI]] station, part of the [[European VLBI Network]] (EVN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/index_EN.htm|title=Home page|accessdate=2015-04-30|publisher=Medicina Radio Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 564 by 640&amp;nbsp;m (30000 square meter) multi-element ''[[#Northern Cross Radio Telescope|Northern Cross]]'' cylindrical-parabolic transit radio telescope for observing at 408 [[MHz]].&lt;ref name=description&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ira.inaf.it/Medicinaweb/Nc/DESCRIPTION.htm|title=Description|accessdate=2015-04-30|publisher=Medicina Radio Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Cross Radio Telescope==
The '''Northern Cross Radio Telescope''' ('''Croce del Nord''' in Italian) is one of the largest transit radio telescopes in the world. Observations are focused around 408&amp;nbsp;MHz ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF band]]), corresponding to 73.5&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength. The older receivers of the telescope function with a 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz wide frequency band, while the upgraded parts have a 16&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].&lt;ref name=cross-debris&gt;{{cite news|journal = International Astronautical Congress, IAC 2014|title = Orbit determination of space debris using a bi-static radar configuration with a multiple-beam receiver|author = A. Morselli and R. Armellin and P. Di Lizia and F. Bernelli-Zazzera and E. Salerno and G. Bianchi and S. Montebugnoli and A. Magro and K.Z. Adami|location = Toronto, Canada|year = 2014|pages = 1–11|url = http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/372082/1/Article-formatted.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telescope is steerable only in declination, meaning that it can solely observe objects that are culminating on the local [[Meridian (astronomy)|celestial meridian]].&lt;ref name=description /&gt; The telescope is T-shaped and consists of:

* E/W (East-West) arm - Single reflector 560 m x 35 m (1536 [[Dipole antenna|dipoles]])
* N/S (North-South) arm - Array of 64 reflectors 640 m x 23.5 m (4096 dipoles)

The telescope can provide 22880 possible theoretical independent beams and has a [[field of view]] of 55.47 degrees (East-West) by 1.8 degrees (North-South).&lt;ref name=cross-debris /&gt; The resolution is around 4-5 [[Minute of arc|arcminutes]] in the North-South direction, and 4 arcminutes in the East-West direction. While less than the resolution of large [[optical telescopes]], the amount of radiation which can be gathered with the Northern Cross is much greater, proportional to the mirror surface of approximately 27400 square meters.  Northern Cross represents the largest UHF-band antenna in the [[Northern hemisphere]], with an [[Antenna aperture|aperture efficiency]] of 60%, making it second in the world, after the [[Arecibo radio telescope]].&lt;ref name=cross-debris /&gt; This allows the Northern Cross to identify and measure extremely faint sources, making the telescope is particularly suitable to [[Extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic researches]].&lt;ref name=description /&gt;

There are plans upgrade of the East-West arm telescope to a [[LOFAR]] SuperStation, due to the good performances of a cylindrical-parabolic antenna in the 100-700&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency range. Since LOFAR operates in the 120-240&amp;nbsp;MHz range, some of the sensors on the Northern Cross Radio Telescope, optimized for 408&amp;nbsp;MHz, will have to be replaced with broadband antennas. This installation will have an effective area much larger than any other remote LOFAR station. If extended to the whole 22000 square meters area of the East-West arm, this single element effective area of 20 standard remote LOFAR stations. The resulting system will provide signification improvement in observation sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/Lofar_page8EN.htm|title=LOFAR SuperStation|accessdate=2015-05-02|publisher=Medicina Radio Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astron.nl/other/workshop/MCCT/MondayVirone.pdf|title=Electromagnetic development of broadband antenna feeding arrays for the Northern Cross Radio Telescope|accessdate=2015-04-30|publisher=IEIIT-CNR}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Square Kilometre Array pathfinder==
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico - BEIC 6339200.jpg|thumb|Photo by [[Paolo Monti]]]]

The Cross is currently used as a pathfinder for the [[Square Kilometre Array]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ira.inaf.it/Medicinaweb/Nc/SKA%20ACTIVITIES.htm|title=SKA Activities|accessdate=2015-04-30|publisher=Medicina Radio Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is focused on studying the amplification and filtering of signals between the LNA (Low Noise Amplifier) output and the [[Analog-to-Digital Converter]] input for the SKA. The Medicina Radio Observatory is studying all problems related to "antenna array implementation" through a prototype installation called MAD (Medicina Array Demonstrator).&lt;ref name=technology&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/tecnologie.html|title=Technology Developments|accessdate=2015-05-02|publisher=IRA-INAF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory staff have also built new receiver demonstrators for the SKA called ''BEST'' (Basic Element for SKA Training), part of the [[European Union|EU]]-funded SKADS (SKA Design Studies) programme.&lt;ref name=best-x&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/BEST/index_en.htm| title=BEST-X Project|accessdate=2015-05-22|publisher=IRA-INAF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project started in 2005 and finished in 2009. It involved the installation of the new receivers on some reflectors of the North-South section (and later East-West section) of the Northern Cross telescope, along with new analog [[fiber-optic]] and [[coaxial]] digital finks from the front-end receiver boxes to the back-ends.&lt;ref name=receivers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/ricevitori.html|title=Receiver Design and Development|accessdate=2015-05-02|publisher=IRA-INAF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite proceedings|author = Montebugnoli, S. and Bianchi, G. and Monari, J. and Naldi, G. and Perini, F. and Schiaffino, M.|title=BEST: Basic Element for SKA Training|journal = Wide Field Astronomy &amp; Technology for the Square Kilometre Array|year = 2009|pages = 331-336|url = http://pos.sissa.it/archive/conferences/132/058/SKADS%202009_058.pdf|conference=SKADS Conference 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BEST project was divided in three parts:&lt;ref name=best-x /&gt;

* BEST-1 - 4 new receivers were installed on a single reflector of the North-South arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/BEST/BEST-1_en.htm| title=BEST-1|accessdate=2015-05-22|publisher=IRA-INAF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* BEST-2 - 32 receivers were installed on 8 reflectors of the North-South arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/BEST/BEST-2_en.htm| title=BEST-2|accessdate=2015-05-22|publisher=IRA-INAF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* BEST-3lo focused on lower frequencies - between 120-240&amp;nbsp;MHz. [[Log periodic antenna]]s optimized for 120-240&amp;nbsp;MHz, along with 18 receivers were installed on part of the East-West arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/BEST/BEST-3_en.htm| title=BEST-3lo|accessdate=2015-05-22|publisher=IRA-INAF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space debris tracking==
There is an ongoing effort to use the 32 meter dish as a receiver for radar-based tracking system [[artificial satellites]] and [[space debris]] in [[Earth orbit]]. The system functions as a [[bistatic radar]], where an emitter located in a different location sends a signal, which bounces off objects in orbit and the echo is picked up by a receiver. The 32 meter dish acts as receiver, while usually the [[Yevpatoria RT-70 radio telescope|Yevpatoria 70 meter]] located in [[Crimea]], functions as a transmitter. The systems can either actively track debris to determine their orbit more precisely or utilize a technique called [[beam park]], where the transmitting and receiving antennas are kept fixed at a given position and the debris pass in and out of the observed area. The measurements obtain through such a system can be used to determine object [[radar cross-section]], time of peak occurrence, [[polarization (antenna)|polarization]] ratio, bistatic [[doppler shift]] and target rotation. In one of the carried-out tests, Yevpatoria-Medicina system was able to detect an object with an estimated radar cross section of 0.0002 square meter, which was created by the [[2009 satellite collision|Iridium 33 and Kosmos-2251 satellite collision]]. The system can also function as a [[multistatic radar]] using the 32 meter receivers at Medicina, the [[Noto Radio Observatory]] in Italy and the [[Ventspils Starptautiskais Radioastronomijas Centrs]] in [[Latvia]].&lt;ref name=debris&gt;{{cite news |
author = Pupillo, G. and Salerno, E. and Bartolini, M. and Di Martino, M. and Mattana, A. and Montebugnoli, S. and Portelli, C. and  Pluchino, S. and Schilliro, F. and Konovalenko, A. and Nabatov, A. and Nechaeva, M.|title = The INAF contribution to the ASI Space Debris program: observational activities|journal = Memorie della Societa Astronomica Italiana Supplementi|year = 2012|volume = 20|pages = 43|url = http://sait.oat.ts.astro.it/MSAIS/20/PDF/43.pdf|bibcode = 2012MSAIS..20...43P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern Cross radio telescope has also been part of space debris tracking studies, utilized as a multiple-beam receiver for a bistatic radar system. The first tested configuration is a quasi-monostatic radar system, with a 3 m dish as transmitter, located in [[Bagnara]] - 20&amp;nbsp;km from the receiver. The second configuration was a simulation of a true bistatic radar system with 7 m dish as transmitter located at the site of the [[Sardinia Radio Telescope]] (SRT). The system has a maximum field-of-view of about 100 square degrees and collecting area of approximately 27400 square meter and is capable of providing up to 22880 beams, each 4 by 4 arcminutes wide. Tracking the sequence of beams that are illuminated, makes possible for the system to track with higher level of detail, with respect to the single-beam systems, the [[ground track]] of a transiting object.&lt;ref name=cross-debris /&gt; The Northern Cross radio telescope in a bistatic radar configuration is also part of the Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) segment of the [[ESA]] [[Space Situational Awareness Programme]] (SSA).&lt;ref name=sst-radars&gt;{{cite web|url = https://sst.ssa.esa.int/cwbi/general/radar_sens.xhtml|title=Europe’s Radar Space Surveillance and Tracking Sensors|access-date=2015-05-04|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mugar Omni Theater''' is a domed [[IMAX]] theater at the [[Museum of Science, Boston|Museum of Science]], in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mos.org/exhibits_shows/imax Museum of Science, Boston | Imax&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Mugar Omni is named after [[Stephen P. Mugar]], the founder of [[Star Market]], and his wife Marian G. Mugar. The Mugar Omni is non-profit and opened in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;.http://www.bigmoviezone.com/txshows/theaters/index.html?uniq=496&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 900,000 visitors came in its first year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiteoakassoc.com/about/gallery/mugar.html White Oak Associates, Inc. - About Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819003236/http://www.whiteoakassoc.com/about/gallery/mugar.html |date=2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the only domed IMAX theater in [[New England]] and is one of only 60 IMAX Theaters in the world to offer 180 degree domed viewing. The seats are set at a steep (cliff-side) angle and recline about thirty degrees, the screen is five stories tall, and the theater is filled with an impressive surround sound system. Because the screen fills a viewer's field of vision (including periphery vision) the screen and surround sound system give viewers the feeling of immersion and motion giving visitors a unique life like experience when viewing films. Viewers must turn their heads left to right up and down  to capture all that is going on. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostoncentral.com/activities/theater/p1247.php Mugar Omni IMAX Theater At Boston Museum of Science | Boston Central&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The theater only shows films of educational and scientific interest such as: ''Bears'', ''Beavers'', Amazing Caves'', Shackleton's Antarctic Adventure'' and more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homestead.com/stfdigcreektribe/files/htm/bms_omni.html Mugar Omni Theater at Boston's Museum of Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The average 70mm Omnimax film reel is around 3 miles long, weighs 200 pounds, and needs to be configured manually.

'''Neural oscillations''', or '''brainwaves''', are rhythmic or repetitive patterns of neural activity in the [[central nervous system]]. [[Neural tissue]] can generate [[oscillation|oscillatory activity]] in many ways, driven either by mechanisms within individual [[neurons]] or by interactions between neurons.  In individual neurons, oscillations can appear either as oscillations in [[membrane potential]] or as rhythmic patterns of [[action potentials]], which then produce oscillatory activation of [[post-synaptic potential|post-synaptic]] neurons.  At the level of [[neural ensemble]]s, synchronized activity of large numbers of neurons can give rise to [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] oscillations, which can be observed in an [[electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]]. Oscillatory activity in groups of neurons generally arises from feedback connections between the neurons that result in the synchronization of their firing patterns. The interaction between neurons can give rise to oscillations at a different frequency than the firing frequency of individual neurons. A well-known example of macroscopic neural oscillations is [[alpha wave|alpha activity]].

Neural oscillations were observed by researchers as early as 1924 (by [[Hans Berger]]). More than 50 years later, intrinsic oscillatory behavior was encountered in vertebrate neurons, but its functional role is still not fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Llinas|first1=R. R. |title=Intrinsic electrical properties of mammalian neurons and CNS function: a historical perspective |journal=Front Cell Neurosci |volume=8 |page=320 |year=2014 |pmid=25408634 |pmc=4219458 |doi=10.3389/fncel.2014.00320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible roles of neural oscillations include [[neural binding|feature binding]], [[neural code|information transfer mechanisms]] and the [[central pattern generator|generation of rhythmic motor output]]. Over the last decades more insight has been gained, especially with advances in [[brain imaging]]. A major area of research in [[neuroscience]] involves determining how oscillations are generated and what their roles are. Oscillatory activity in the brain is widely observed at different [[levels of Organization (anatomy)|levels of organization]] and is thought to play a key role in processing neural information. Numerous experimental studies support a functional role of neural oscillations; a unified interpretation, however, is still lacking.

== Overview ==

Neural oscillations are observed throughout the central nervous system at all levels, and include [[action potential|spike trains]], [[local field potentials]] and large-scale [[oscillation]]s which can be measured by [[electroencephalography]] (EEG). In general, oscillations can be characterized by their [[frequency]], [[amplitude]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]]. These signal properties can be extracted from neural recordings using [[time-frequency analysis]]. In large-scale oscillations, amplitude changes are considered to result from changes in synchronization within a [[neural ensemble]], also referred to as local synchronization. In addition to local synchronization, oscillatory activity of distant neural structures (single neurons or neural ensembles) can synchronize. Neural oscillations and synchronization have been linked to many cognitive functions such as information transfer, perception, motor control and memory.&lt;ref name = "Fries 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fries P | title = A mechanism for cognitive dynamics: neuronal communication through neuronal coherence | journal = TICS | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 474–480 | year = 2005 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fell J, Axmacher N | title = The role of phase synchronization in memory processes | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 12 | pages = 105–118 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1038/nrn2979 | pmid = 21248789 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Schnitzler 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nrn1650 | vauthors = Schnitzler A, Gross J | title = Normal and pathological oscillatory communication in the brain | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 6 | pages = 285&amp;ndash;296 | year = 2005 | pmid=15803160 | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neural oscillations have been most widely studied in neural activity generated by large groups of neurons. Large-scale activity can be measured by techniques such as EEG. In general, EEG signals have a broad spectral content similar to [[pink noise]], but also reveal oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands. The first discovered and best-known frequency band is [[alpha waves|alpha activity]] (7.5–12.5 [[Hertz|Hz]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2654794 | pmid=19300566 | volume=3 | title=Mechanisms of modafinil: A review of current research | date=June 2007 | vauthors=Gerrard P, Malcolm R | journal=Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | pages=349–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be detected from the [[occipital lobe]] during relaxed wakefulness and which increases when the eyes are closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berger H, Gray CM | title = Uber das Elektroenkephalogramm des Menschen | journal = Arch Psychiat Nervenkr | volume = 87 | pages = 527–570 | year = 1929 | doi = 10.1007/BF01797193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other frequency bands are: [[delta wave|delta]] (1&amp;ndash;4&amp;nbsp;Hz), [[theta wave|theta]] (4&amp;ndash;8&amp;nbsp;Hz), [[beta wave|beta]] (13&amp;ndash;30&amp;nbsp;Hz), [[gamma wave|low gamma]] (30&amp;ndash;70&amp;nbsp;Hz), and [[gamma wave|high gamma]] (70&amp;ndash;150&amp;nbsp;Hz) frequency bands, where faster rhythms such as gamma activity have been linked to cognitive processing. Indeed, EEG signals change dramatically during sleep and show a transition from faster frequencies to increasingly slower frequencies such as alpha waves. In fact, different sleep stages are commonly characterized by their spectral content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dement W, Kleitman N |title=Cyclic variations in EEG during sleep and their relation to eye movements, body motility and dreaming |journal=Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol |year=1957 |volume=9 |pages=673–90 |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(57)90088-3 |pmid=13480240 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, neural oscillations have been linked to cognitive states, such as [[awareness]] and [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Engel AK, Singer W |title=Temporal binding and the neural correlates of sensory awareness |year=2001 |volume=5 |pages=16–25 |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01568-0 |issue=1 |pmid=11164732 |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Varela 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Varela F, Lachaux JP, Rodriguez E, Martinerie J | title = The brainweb: phase synchronization and large-scale integration | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 2 | pages = 229–239 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1038/35067550 | pmid = 11283746 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although neural oscillations in human brain activity are mostly investigated using EEG recordings, they are also observed using more invasive recording techniques such as [[single-unit recording]]s. Neurons can generate rhythmic patterns of [[action potential]]s or spikes. Some types of neurons have the tendency to fire at particular frequencies, so-called ''resonators''.&lt;ref name = "Izhikevich 2007"&gt;{{cite book | author = Izhikevich EM | title = Dynamical systems in neuroscience | publisher = The MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts |  year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bursting]] is another form of rhythmic spiking. Spiking patterns are considered fundamental for [[neural coding|information coding]] in the brain. Oscillatory activity can also be observed in the form of [[subthreshold membrane potential oscillations]] (i.e. in the absence of action potentials).&lt;ref name = "Llinas 1986"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Llinas R, Yarom Y | year = 1986 | title = Oscillatory properties of guinea-pig inferior olivary neurones and their pharmacological modulation: an in vitro study | journal = J Physiol | volume=376 | pages=163&amp;ndash;182 | pmid=3795074 | pmc=1182792 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If numerous neurons spike in [[synchronization|synchrony]], they can give rise to oscillations in [[local field potentials]]. Quantitative models can estimate the strength of neural oscillations in recorded data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =Mureșan RC, Jurjuț OF, Moca VV, Singer W, Nikolić D | title = The Oscillation Score: An Efficient Method for Estimating Oscillation Strength in Neuronal Activity | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | year = 2008  | volume = 99 |issue=3 | pages = 1333–1353 | doi =10.1152/jn.00772.2007 | pmid =18160427 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neural oscillations are commonly studied from a mathematical framework and belong to the field of "neurodynamics", an area of research in the [[cognitive science]]s that places a strong focus upon the dynamic character of neural activity in describing [[brain]] function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1086/286819 | author = Burrow T | title = The neurodynamics of behavior. A phylobiological foreword | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 10 | pages = 271–288 | year = 1943 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers the brain a [[dynamical system]] and uses [[differential equations]] to describe how neural activity evolves over time. In particular, it aims to relate dynamic patterns of brain activity to cognitive functions such as perception and memory. In very [[abstract structure|abstract form]], neural oscillations can be analyzed [[Analytical expression|analytically]]. When studied in a more physiologically realistic setting, oscillatory activity is generally studied using [[computer simulation]]s of a [[computational neuroscience|computational model]].

The functions of neural oscillations are wide-ranging and vary for different types of oscillatory activity. Examples are the generation of rhythmic activity such as a [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] and the [[neural binding]] of sensory features in perception, such as the shape and color of an object. Neural oscillations also play an important role in many [[neurological disorder]]s, such as excessive synchronization during [[seizure]] activity in [[epilepsy]] or [[tremor]] in patients with [[Parkinson's disease]]. Oscillatory activity can also be used to control external devices in [[brain–computer interface]]s, in which subjects can control an external device by changing the amplitude of particular brain rhythmics &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1608085&lt;/ref&gt;.{{additional citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Physiology==
{{main|Electrophysiology}}

Oscillatory activity is observed throughout the [[central nervous system]] at all levels of organization. Three different levels have been widely recognized: the micro-scale (activity of a single neuron), the meso-scale (activity of a local group of neurons) and the macro-scale (activity of different brain regions).&lt;ref name = "Haken 1996"&gt;{{cite book | author=Haken H | title= Principles of brain functioning | year=1996 | publisher=Springer | isbn=3-540-58967-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Current Clamp recording of Neuron.GIF|thumb|right|[[Tonic (physiology)|Tonic]] firing pattern of single neuron showing rhythmic spiking activity]]

=== Microscopic ===

Neurons generate [[action potentials]] resulting from changes in the electric membrane potential. Neurons can generate multiple action potentials in sequence forming so-called spike trains. These spike trains are the basis for [[neural coding]] and information transfer in the brain. Spike trains can form all kinds of patterns, such as rhythmic spiking and [[bursting]], and often display oscillatory activity.&lt;ref name = "Wang 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wang XJ | title= Neurophysiological and computational principles of cortical rhythms in cognition | year=2010 | journal=Physiol Rev | volume=90 | pages = 1195–1268 | doi=10.1152/physrev.00035.2008 | issue=3 | pmid=20664082 | pmc=2923921}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscillatory activity in single neurons can also be observed in [[subthreshold membrane potential oscillations|sub-threshold fluctuations]] in membrane potential. These rhythmic changes in membrane potential do not reach the critical threshold and therefore do not result in an action potential. They can result from postsynaptic potentials from synchronous inputs or from intrinsic properties of neurons.

Neuronal spiking can be classified by their activity patterns. The excitability of neurons can be subdivided in Class I and II. Class I neurons can generate action potentials with arbitrarily low frequency depending on the input strength, whereas Class II neurons generate action potentials in a certain frequency band, which is relatively insensitive to changes in input strength.&lt;ref name = "Izhikevich 2007"/&gt; Class II neurons are also more prone to display sub-threshold oscillations in membrane potential.

=== Mesoscopic ===

A group of neurons can also generate oscillatory activity. Through synaptic interactions the firing patterns of different neurons may become synchronized and the rhythmic changes in electric potential caused by their action potentials will add up ([[Interference (wave propagation)|constructive interference]]). That is, synchronized firing patterns result in synchronized input into other cortical areas, which gives rise to large-amplitude oscillations of the [[local field potential]]. These large-scale oscillations can also be measured outside the scalp using [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) and [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG). The electric potentials generated by single neurons are far too small to be picked up outside the scalp, and EEG or MEG activity always reflects the summation of the synchronous activity of thousands or millions of neurons that have similar spatial orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Nunez PL, Srinivasan R | title = Electric fields of the brain: The neurophysics of EEG |publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1981 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gu5qAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurons in a [[neural ensemble]] rarely all fire at exactly the same moment, i.e. fully synchronized. Instead, the probability of firing is rhythmically modulated such that neurons are more likely to fire at the same time, which gives rise to oscillations in their mean activity (see figure at top of page). As such, the frequency of [[macroscopic scale|large-scale]] oscillations does not need to match the firing pattern of individual neurons. Isolated cortical neurons fire regularly under certain conditions, but in the intact brain cortical cells are bombarded by highly fluctuating synaptic inputs and typically fire seemingly at random. However, if the probability of a large group of neurons is rhythmically modulated at a common frequency, they will generate oscillations in the mean field (see also figure at top of page).&lt;ref name='Wang 2010'/&gt; Neural ensembles can generate oscillatory activity [[endogenous]]ly through local interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In particular, inhibitory [[interneurons]] play an important role in producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation and rhythmically modulating the firing rate of excitatory neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Cardin JA, Carlen M, Meletis K, Knoblich, U, Zhang F, Deisseroth K, Tsai LH, Moore CI | title =Driving fast-spiking cells induces gamma rhythm and controls sensory responses | journal = Nature | year = 2009 | volume= 459 | issue= 7247 | pages= 663–U63 |  doi=10.1038/nature08002 | pmid=19396156| pmc = 3655711| bibcode=2009Natur.459..663C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macroscopic ===

Neural oscillation can also arise from interactions between different brain areas coupled through the structural [[connectome]]. [[Propagation delay|Time delays]] play an important role here. Because all brain areas are bidirectionally coupled, these connections between brain areas form [[feedback]] loops. [[Positive feedback]] loops tends to cause oscillatory activity where frequency is inversely related to the delay time. An example of such a feedback loop is the connections between the [[thalamus]] and [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] – the [[thalamocortical radiation]]s. This thalamocortical network is able to generate oscillatory activity known as [[recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Llinás R, Ribary U, Contreras D, Pedroarena C | title = The neuronal basis for consciousness | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

==Mechanisms==

=== Neuronal properties ===
{{see also|Action potential|Bursting}}

Scientists have identified some intrinsic [[neuron|neuronal properties]] that play an important role in generating membrane potential oscillations. In particular, [[voltage-gated ion channels]] are critical in the generation of action potentials. The dynamics of these ion channels have been captured in the well-established [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] that describes how action potentials are initiated and propagated by means of a set of differential equations. Using [[bifurcation theory|bifurcation analysis]], different oscillatory varieties of these neuronal models can be determined, allowing for the classification of types of neuronal responses. The oscillatory dynamics of neuronal spiking as identified in the Hodgkin–Huxley model closely agree with empirical findings. In addition to periodic spiking, [[subthreshold membrane potential oscillations]], i.e. [[resonance]] behavior that does not result in action potentials, may also contribute to oscillatory activity by facilitating synchronous activity of neighboring neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Llinas RR | title = The Intrinsic electrophysiological properties of mammalian neurons: A new insight into CNS function | journal = Science | volume = 242 | pages = 1654–1664 | year = 1988 | doi = 10.1126/science.3059497 | pmid = 3059497 | issue = 4886| bibcode = 1988Sci...242.1654L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Llinas RR, Grace AA, Yarom Y | year = 1991 | title = In vitro neurons in mammalian cortical layer 4 exhibit intrinsic oscillatory activity in the 10- to 50-Hz frequency range | journal = Proc.

Bursting neurons have the potential to serve as pacemakers for synchronous network oscillations, and bursts of spikes may underlie or enhance neuronal resonance.&lt;ref name = 'Wang 2010'/&gt;

=== Network properties ===
{{see also| Connectome}}

Apart from intrinsic properties of neurons, [[biological neural network]] properties are also an important source of oscillatory activity. Neurons [[Neuron#Connectivity|communicate]] with one another via synapses and affect the timing of spike trains in the post-synaptic neurons. Depending on the properties of the connection, such as the coupling strength, time delay and whether coupling is [[EPSP|excitatory]] or [[IPSP|inhibitory]], the spike trains of the interacting neurons may become [[phase synchronization|synchronized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zeitler M, Daffertshofer A, Gielen CC | year = 2009 | title =Asymmetry in pulse-coupled oscillators with delay | journal = Phys. Rev. E| volume = 79 | issue = 6 | p = 065203(R) | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.79.065203 | bibcode = 2009PhRvE..79f5203Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neurons are locally connected, forming small clusters that are called [[neural ensemble]]s. Certain network structures promote oscillatory activity at specific frequencies. For example, neuronal activity generated by two populations of interconnected ''inhibitory'' and ''excitatory'' cells can show spontaneous oscillations that are described by the [[Wilson-Cowan model]].

If a group of neurons engages in synchronized oscillatory activity, the neural ensemble can be mathematically represented as a single oscillator.&lt;ref name = "Haken 1996"/&gt; Different neural ensembles are coupled through long-range connections and form a network of weakly coupled oscillators at the next spatial scale. Weakly coupled oscillators can generate a range of dynamics including oscillatory activity.&lt;ref name = "Pikovsky 2001"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pikovsky A, Rosenblum M, Kurths J | title= Synchronization: a universal concept in nonlinear sciences | year=2001 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-53352-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-range connections between different brain structures, such as the [[thalamus]] and the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] (see [[Recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance|thalamocortical oscillation]]), involve time-delays due to the finite [[Action potential#Propagation|conduction velocity]] of axons. Because most connections are reciprocal, they form [[feedback|feed-back loops]] that support oscillatory activity. Oscillations recorded from multiple cortical areas can become synchronized to form [[large scale brain networks]], whose dynamics and functional connectivity can be studied by means of [[frequency domain|spectral analysis]] and [[Granger causality]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Brovelli, Steven L. Bressler and their colleagues, [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/101/26/9849.pdf 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Coherent activity of large-scale brain activity may form dynamic links between brain areas required for the integration of distributed information.&lt;ref name = "Varela 2001"/&gt;

=== Neuromodulation ===
{{main| Neuromodulation (biology)}}

In addition to fast direct [[synapse|synaptic interactions]] between neurons forming a network, oscillatory activity is regulated by [[neuromodulators]] on a much slower time scale. That is, the concentration levels of certain neurotransmitters are known to regulate the amount of oscillatory activity. For instance, [[GABA]] concentration has been shown to be positively correlated with frequency of oscillations in induced stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muthukumaraswamy SD, Edden RA, Jones DK, Swettenham JB, Singh KD | title = Resting GABA concentration predicts peak gamma frequency and fMRI amplitude in response to visual stimulation in humans | journal = Proc.

These neurotransmitter systems affect the physiological state, e.g., [[wakefulness]] or [[arousal]], and have a pronounced effect on amplitude of different brain waves, such as alpha activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moruzzi G, Magoun HW | title = Brain stem reticular formation and activation of the EEG | journal = Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol | volume = 1 | pages = 455–473 | year = 1949 | doi = 10.1016/0013-4694(49)90219-9 | pmid = 18421835 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical description ==
{{see also| Computational neuroscience}}

Oscillations can often be described and analyzed using mathematics. Mathematicians have identified several [[dynamical systems|dynamical]] mechanisms that generate rhythmicity.  Among the most important are [[harmonic oscillator|harmonic]] (linear) oscillators, [[limit cycle]] oscillators, and delayed-[[feedback]] oscillators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buzsaki G, Draguhn A | title = Neuronal oscillations in cortical networks | journal = Science | volume = 304 | issue = 5679 | year = 2004 | pages = 1926–1929 | doi =  10.1126/science.1099745 | pmid = 15218136 | bibcode = 2004Sci...304.1926B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harmonic oscillations appear very frequently in nature—examples are sound waves, the motion of a [[pendulum]], and vibrations of every sort. They generally arise when a physical system is perturbed by a small degree from a [[Principle of minimum energy|minimum-energy state]], and are well understood mathematically.  Noise-driven harmonic oscillators realistically simulate alpha rhythm in the waking EEG as well as slow waves and spindles in the sleep EEG. Successful EEG analysis algorithms were based on such models. Several other EEG components are better described by limit-cycle or delayed-feedback oscillations.  Limit-cycle oscillations arise from physical systems that show large deviations from [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|equilibrium]], whereas delayed-feedback oscillations arise when components of a system affect each other after significant time delays.  Limit-cycle oscillations can be complex but there are powerful mathematical tools for analyzing them; the mathematics of delayed-feedback oscillations is primitive in comparison. Linear oscillators and limit-cycle oscillators qualitatively differ in terms of how they respond to fluctuations in input.  In a linear oscillator, the frequency is more or less constant but the amplitude can vary greatly. In a limit-cycle oscillator, the amplitude tends to be more or less constant but the frequency can vary greatly.  A [[cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] is an example of a limit-cycle oscillation in that the frequency of beats varies widely, while each individual beat continues to pump about the same amount of blood.

[[Computational models]] adopt a variety of abstractions in order to describe complex oscillatory dynamics observed in brain activity. Many models are used in the field, each defined at a different level of abstraction and trying to model different aspects of neural systems. They range from models of the short-term behaviour of individual neurons, through models of how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons, to models of how behaviour can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems.

=== Single neuron model ===
[[File:Simulation of hrose neuron.png|thumb|right|Simulation of a [[Hindmarsh–Rose model|Hindmarsh–Rose neuron]] showing typical [[bursting]] behavior: a fast rhythm generated by individual spikes and a slower rhythm generated by the bursts.]]

{{see also| Biological neuron model}}

A model of a biological neuron is a mathematical description of the properties of nerve cells, or neurons, that is designed to accurately describe and predict its biological processes. The most successful and widely used model of neurons, the Hodgkin–Huxley model, is based on data from the [[squid giant axon]]. It is a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that approximates the electrical characteristics of a neuron, in particular the generation and propagation of [[action potentials]]. The model is very accurate and detailed and [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]] received the 1963 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for this work.

The mathematics of the Hodgkin–Huxley model are quite complicated and several simplifications have been proposed, such as the [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model]] and the [[Hindmarsh–Rose model]]. Such models only capture the basic neuronal dynamics, such as rhythmic spiking and [[bursting]], but are more computationally efficient. This allows the simulation of a large number of interconnected neurons that form a [[neural network]].

=== Spiking model ===
{{see also| Neural network}}

A neural network model describes a population of physically interconnected neurons or a group of disparate neurons whose inputs or signalling targets define a recognizable circuit.  These models aim to describe how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons. Local interactions between neurons can result in the synchronization of spiking activity and form the basis of oscillatory activity. In particular, models of interacting [[pyramidal cells]] and inhibitory [[interneurons]] have been shown to generate brain rhythms such as [[gamma wave|gamma activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whittington MA, Traub RD, Kopell N, Ermentrout B, Buhl EH |title=Inhibition-based rhythms: experimental and mathematical observations on network dynamics |journal= Int J Psychophysiol |volume=38 |pages=315–336 |year=2000 |doi=10.1016/S0167-8760(00)00173-2 |pmid=11102670 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also| Wilson-Cowan model}}

Neural field models are another important tool in studying neural oscillations and are a mathematical framework describing evolution of variables such as mean firing rate in space and time. In modeling the activity of large numbers of neurons, the central idea is to take the density of neurons to the continuum limit, resulting in spatially continuous [[neural networks]]. Instead of modelling individual neurons, this approach approximates a group of neurons by its average properties and interactions. It is based on the [[mean field theory|mean field approach]], an area of [[statistical physics]] that deals with large-scale systems. Models based on these principles have been used to provide mathematical descriptions of neural oscillations and EEG rhythms. They have for instance been used to investigate visual hallucinations.&lt;ref&gt;Bressloff PC, Cowan JD (2003) Spontaneous pattern formation in primary visual cortex.

=== Kuramoto model ===
[[File:KuramotoModel.ogv|thumb|240px| right|Simulation of [[Kuramoto model]] showing neural synchronization and oscillations in the mean field]]

{{main|Kuramoto model}}

The [[Kuramoto model]] of coupled phase oscillators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Kuramoto Y | title= Chemical Oscillations, Waves, and Turbulence | year=1984 | publisher=Dover Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the most abstract and fundamental models used to investigate neural oscillations and synchronization. It captures the activity of a local system (e.g., a single neuron or neural ensemble) by its circular [[phase (waves)|phase]] alone and hence ignores the amplitude of oscillations (amplitude is constant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ermentrout B | contribution = An introduction to neural oscillators | editor = F Ventriglia | title= Neural Modeling and Neural Networks | year = 1994 | pages = 79–110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions amongst these oscillators are introduced by a simple algebraic form (such as a [[trigonometric functions|sine]] function) and collectively generate a dynamical pattern at the global scale. The Kuramoto model is widely used to study oscillatory brain activity and several extensions have been proposed that increase its neurobiological plausibility, for instance by incorporating topological properties of local cortical connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3389/fnhum.2010.00190 | vauthors = Breakspear M, Heitmann S, Daffertshofer A | title = Generative models of cortical oscillations: Neurobiological implications of the Kuramoto model | journal = Front Hum Neurosci | volume = 4 | p = 190 | year = 2010 | pmid=21151358 |pmc=2995481}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it describes how the activity of a group of interacting neurons can become synchronized and generate large-scale oscillations. Simulations using the Kuramoto model with realistic long-range cortical connectivity and time-delayed interactions reveal the emergence of slow patterned fluctuations that reproduce resting-state [[Blood-oxygen-level dependent|BOLD]] functional maps, which can be measured using [[fMRI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.04.010 | vauthors = Cabral J, Hugues E, Sporns O, Deco G | title = Role of local network oscillations in resting-state functional connectivity | journal = NeuroImage | year = 2011 | pmid=21511044 | volume=57 | issue=1 | pages=130–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activity patterns ==

Both single neurons and groups of neurons can generate oscillatory activity spontaneously. In addition, they may show oscillatory responses to perceptual input or motor output. Some types of neurons will fire rhythmically in the absence of any synaptic input. Likewise, brain-wide activity reveals oscillatory activity while subjects do not engage in any activity, so-called [[resting state fMRI|resting-state activity]]. These ongoing rhythms can change in different ways in response to perceptual input or motor output. Oscillatory activity may respond by increases or decreases in frequency and amplitude or show a temporary interruption, which is referred to as phase resetting. In addition, external activity may not interact with ongoing activity at all, resulting in an additive response.

=== Ongoing activity ===

Spontaneous activity is [[brain]] activity in the absence of an explicit task, such as sensory input or motor output, and hence also referred to as resting-state activity. It is opposed to induced activity, i.e. brain activity that is induced by sensory stimuli or motor responses.  The term ''ongoing brain activity'' is used in [[electroencephalography]] and [[magnetoencephalography]] for those signal components that are not associated with the processing of a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] or the occurrence of specific other events, such as moving a body part, i.e. events that do not form [[evoked potential]]s/[[evoked field]]s, or induced activity. Spontaneous activity is usually considered to be [[Signal noise|noise]] if one is interested in stimulus processing; however, spontaneous activity is considered to play a crucial role during brain development, such as in network formation and synaptogenesis.  Spontaneous activity may be informative regarding the current mental state of the person (e.g. wakefulness, alertness) and is often used in sleep research. Certain types of oscillatory activity, such as [[alpha wave]]s, are part of spontaneous activity. Statistical analysis of power fluctuations of alpha activity reveals a bimodal distribution, i.e. a high- and low-amplitude mode, and hence shows that resting-state activity does not just reflect a [[Gaussian noise|noise]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Bistability and non-Gaussian fluctuations in spontaneous cortical activity |vauthors=Freyer F, Aquino K, Robinson PA, Ritter P, Breakspear M | year=2009 |journal=J Neurosci |volume=29 |issue=26 |pages=8512–8524 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0754-09.2009 |pmid=19571142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of fMRI, spontaneous fluctuations in the [[blood-oxygen-level dependent]] (BOLD) signal reveal correlation patterns that are linked to resting states networks, such as the [[default network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn2201 |title=Spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging |vauthors=Fox MD, Raichle ME |year=2007 |journal=Nat Rev Neurosci |volume=8 |pages=700&amp;ndash;711 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temporal evolution of resting state networks is correlated with fluctuations of oscillatory EEG activity in different frequency bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging |vauthors=Laufs H, Kraków K, Sterzer P, Eger E, Beyerle A, Salek-Haddadi A, Kleinschmidt A|year=2003 |journal=PNAS |volume=100 |issue=19 |pages=11053–11058 |pmid=12958209 |pmc=196925 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1831638100|bibcode=2003PNAS..10011053L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing brain activity may also have an important role in perception, as it may interact with activity related to incoming stimuli. Indeed, [[EEG]] studies suggest that visual perception is dependent on both the phase and amplitude of cortical oscillations. For instance, the amplitude and phase of alpha activity at the moment of visual stimulation predicts whether a weak stimulus will be perceived by the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mathewson KE, Gratton G, Fabiani M, Beck DM, Ro T | journal =  J Neurosci | volume = 29 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3963-08.2009 | title = To see or not to see: Prestimulus α phase predicts visual awareness | year = 2009 | pages = 2725–32 | pmid = 19261866 | issue = 9 | pmc = 2724892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Busch NA, Dubois J, VanRullen R | journal =  J Neurosci | volume = 29 | doi = 10.1523/jneurosci.0113-09.2009 | title = The phase of ongoing EEG oscillations predicts visual perception | year = 2009 | pages = 7869–76 | pmid = 19535598 | issue = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Dijk H, Schoffelen JM, Oostenveld R, Jensen O | journal =  J Neurosci | volume = 28 | doi = 10.1523/jneurosci.1853-07.2008 | title = Prestimulus oscillatory activity in the alpha band predicts visual discrimination ability | year = 2008 | pages = 1816–1823 | issue = 8 | pmid = 18287498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frequency response ===

In response to input, a neuron or neuronal ensemble may change the frequency at which it oscillates, thus changing the [[rate coding|rate]] at which it spikes. Often, a neuron's firing rate depends on the summed activity it receives. Frequency changes are also commonly observed in central pattern generators and directly relate to the speed of motor activities, such as step frequency in walking. However, changes in ''relative'' oscillation frequency between different brain areas is not so common because the frequency of oscillatory activity is often related to the time delays between brain areas.

=== Phase resetting ===

Phase resetting occurs when input to a neuron or neuronal ensemble resets the phase of ongoing oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tass PA | title=Phase resetting in medicine and biology: stochastic modelling and data analysis | year = 2007 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin Heidelberg |isbn=3-540-65697-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very common in single neurons where spike timing is adjusted to neuronal input (a neuron may spike at a fixed delay in response to periodic input, which is referred to as phase locking&lt;ref name="Izhikevich 2007"/&gt;) and may also occur in neuronal ensembles when the phases of their neurons are adjusted simultaneously. Phase resetting is fundamental for the synchronization of different neurons or different brain regions&lt;ref name = "Varela 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pikovsky 2001"/&gt; because the timing of spikes can become phase locked to the activity of other neurons.

Phase resetting also permits the study of evoked activity, a term used in [[electroencephalography]] and [[magnetoencephalography]] for responses in brain activity that are directly related to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]-related activity. [[Evoked potential]]s and [[event-related potential]]s are obtained from an electroencephalogram by stimulus-locked averaging, i.e. averaging different trials at fixed latencies around the presentation of a stimulus. As a consequence, those signal components that are the same in each single measurement are conserved and all others, i.e. ongoing or spontaneous activity, are averaged out. That is, event-related potentials only reflect oscillations in brain activity that are [[phase (waves)|phase]]-locked to the stimulus or event. Evoked activity is often considered to be independent from ongoing brain activity, although this is an ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1066168 |title=Dynamic brain sources of visual evoked responses|vauthors=Makeig S, Westerfield M, Jung TP, Enghoff S, Townsend J, Courchesne E, Sejnowski TJ |year=2002 |journal=Science |volume=295 |pages=690&amp;ndash;694 |pmid=11809976 |issue=5555|bibcode=2002Sci...295..690M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mäkinen V, Tiitinen H, May P | title = Auditory event-related responses are generated independently of ongoing brain activity | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 24 | pages = 961–968 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.10.020 | pmid = 15670673 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amplitude response ===

Next to evoked activity, neural activity related to stimulus processing may result in induced activity. Induced activity refers to modulation in ongoing brain activity induced by processing of stimuli or movement preparation. Hence, they reflect an indirect response in contrast to evoked responses. A well-studied type of induced activity is amplitude change in oscillatory activity. For instance, [[Gamma wave|gamma activity]] often increases during increased mental activity such as during object representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01299-1|title=Oscillatory gamma activity in humans and its role in object representation|vauthors=Tallon-Baudry C, Bertrand O |year=1999 |journal=Trends Cogn Sci |volume=3 |pages=151&amp;ndash;162|issue=4 |pmid=10322469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because induced responses may have different phases across measurements and therefore would cancel out during averaging, they can only be obtained using [[time-frequency analysis]]. Induced activity generally reflects the activity of numerous neurons: amplitude changes in oscillatory activity are thought to arise from the synchronization of neural activity, for instance by synchronization of spike timing or membrane potential fluctuations of individual neurons. Increases in oscillatory activity are therefore often referred to as event-related synchronization, while decreases are referred to as event-related desynchronization.&lt;ref name = "Pfurtscheller 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1388-2457(99)00141-8 |title=Event-related EEG/MEG synchronization and desynchronization: basic principles |author1=Pfurtscheller G | author2=da Silva FHL |year=1999 |journal=Clin Neurophysiol |volume=110 |pages=1842&amp;ndash;1857 |pmid=10576479 |issue=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Asymmetric amplitude modulation ====

It has recently been proposed that even if phases are not aligned across trials, induced activity may still cause [[event-related potential]]s because ongoing brain oscillations may not be symmetric and thus amplitude modulations may result in a baseline shift that does not average out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A novel mechanism for evoked responses in the human brain|vauthors=Nikulin VV, Linkenkaer-Hansen K, Nolte G, Lemm S, Muller KR, Ilmoniemi RJ, Curio G |year=2007 |journal=Eur J Neurosci |volume=25 |pages=3146&amp;ndash;3154|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05553.x|issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Asymmetric amplitude modulations of brain oscillations generate slow evoked responses|vauthors=Mazaheri A, Jensen O |year=2008 |journal=J Neurosci |volume=28 |pages=7781&amp;ndash;7787|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1631-08.2008|issue=31|pmid=18667610}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model implies that slow event-related responses, such as asymmetric alpha activity, could result from asymmetric brain oscillation amplitude modulations, such as an asymmetry of the intracellular currents that propagate forward and backward down the dendrites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Rhythmic pulsing: linking ongoing brain activity with evoked responses|vauthors=Mazaheri A, Jensen O |year=2008 |journal=Front Hum Neurosci |volume=4 |pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this assumption, asymmetries in the dendritic current would cause asymmetries in oscillatory activity measured by EEG and MEG, since dendritic currents in pyramidal cells are generally thought to generate EEG and MEG signals that can be measured at the scalp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Magnetoencephalography - Theory, instrumentation, and applications to noninvasive studies of the working human brain |vauthors=Hamalainen M, Hari R, Ilmoniemi RJ, Knuutila J, Lounasmaa OV |year=1993 |journal=Rev Mod Phys |volume=65 |pages=413&amp;ndash;497 |bibcode=1993RvMP...65..413H |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.65.413|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

Neural synchronization can be modulated by task constraints, such as [[attention]], and is thought to play a role in [[neural binding|feature binding]],&lt;ref name = "Singer 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ph.55.030193.002025 | author = Singer W | title = Synchronization of cortical activity and its putative role in information processing and learning | journal = Annu Rev Physiol | volume = 55 | pages = 349–374 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8466179}}&lt;/ref&gt; neuronal communication,&lt;ref name = "Fries 2005"/&gt; and [[motor coordination]].&lt;ref name = "Schnitzler 2005"/&gt; Neuronal oscillations became a hot topic in [[neuroscience]] in the 1990s when the studies of the visual system of the brain by Gray, Singer and others appeared to support the [[neural binding]] hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singer W, Gray CM | title = Visual feature integration and the temporal correlation hypothesis | journal = Annu Rev Neurosci | volume = 18 | pages = 555–586 | year = 1995 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ne.18.030195.003011 | pmid = 7605074 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this idea, synchronous oscillations in neuronal ensembles bind neurons representing different features of an object. For example, when a person looks at a tree, visual cortex neurons representing the tree trunk and those representing the branches of the same tree would oscillate in synchrony to form a single representation of the tree. This phenomenon is best seen in [[local field potentials]] which reflect the synchronous activity of local groups of neurons, but has also been shown in [[EEG]] and [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] recordings providing increasing evidence for a close relation between synchronous oscillatory activity and a variety of cognitive functions such as perceptual grouping.&lt;ref name = "Singer 1993"/&gt;

=== Pacemaker ===
{{main|Cardiac pacemaker}}

Cells in the [[sinoatrial node]], located in the [[right atrium]] of the heart, spontaneously depolarize approximately 100 times per minute. Although all of the heart's cells have the ability to generate action potentials that trigger cardiac contraction, the sinoatrial node normally initiates it, simply because it generates impulses slightly faster than the other areas. Hence, these cells generate the normal [[sinus rhythm]] and are called pacemaker cells as they directly control the [[heart rate]]. In the absence of extrinsic neural and hormonal control, cells in the SA node will rhythmically discharge. The sinoatrial node is richly innervated by the [[autonomic nervous system]], which up or down regulates the spontaneous firing frequency of the pacemaker cells.

=== Central pattern generator ===
{{main|Central pattern generator}}

Synchronized firing of neurons also forms the basis of periodic motor commands for rhythmic movements. These rhythmic outputs are produced by a group of interacting neurons that form a network, called a [[central pattern generator]]. Central pattern generators are neuronal circuits that—when activated—can produce rhythmic motor patterns in the absence of sensory or descending inputs that carry specific timing information. Examples are [[walking]], [[control of respiration|breathing]], and [[aquatic locomotion|swimming]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marder E, Bucher D | title = Central pattern generators and the control of rhythmic movements| journal = Curr Biol | volume = 11 | pages = R986–R996 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00581-4 | issue = 23 | pmid = 11728329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most evidence for central pattern generators comes from lower animals, such as the [[lamprey]], but there is also evidence for spinal central pattern generators in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dimitrijevic MR, Gerasimenko Y, Pinter MM | title = Evidence for a spinal central pattern generator in humans| journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 860 | pages = 360–376 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09062.x | pmid=9928325| bibcode = 1998NYASA.860..360D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Danner SM, Hofstoetter US, Freundl B, Binder H, Mayr W, Rattay F, Minassian K | title = Human spinal locomotor control is based on flexibly organized burst generators | journal = Brain | volume = 138 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 577–88 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25582580 | pmc = 4408427 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awu372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Information processing ===
{{main|Neural coding}}

Neuronal spiking is generally considered the basis for information transfer in the brain. For such a transfer, information needs to be coded in a spiking pattern. Different types of coding schemes have been proposed, such as [[rate coding]] and [[temporal coding]]. Neural oscillations could create periodic time windows in which input spikes have larger effect on neurons, thereby providing a mechanism for decoding temporal codes.&lt;ref name = "Gupta2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gupta N, Singh SS, Stopfer M | title = Oscillatory integration windows in neurons | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 7 | pages = 13808 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27976720 | pmc = 5171764 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms13808 | bibcode = 2016NatCo...713808G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perception ===
{{see also| Binding problem}}

Synchronization of neuronal firing may serve as a means to group spatially segregated neurons that respond to the same stimulus in order to bind these responses for further joint processing, i.e. to exploit temporal synchrony to encode relations. Purely theoretical formulations of the binding-by-synchrony hypothesis were proposed first,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Milner PM | title = A model for visual shape recognition | journal = Psychol. Rev. | volume = 81 | issue = 6| pages = 521–535 | year = 1974 | doi = 10.1037/h0037149 | pmid=4445414}}&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently extensive experimental evidence has been reported supporting the potential role of synchrony as a relational code.&lt;ref name = "Gray 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gray CM, König P, Engel AK, Singer W | title = Oscillatory responses in cat visual cortex exhibit inter-columnar synchronization which reflects global stimulus properties | journal = Nature | volume = 338 | pages = 334–337 | year = 1989 |doi=10.1038/338334a0 | issue=6213 | pmid = 2922061| bibcode = 1989Natur.338..334G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functional role of synchronized oscillatory activity in the brain was mainly established in experiments performed on awake kittens with multiple electrodes implanted in the visual cortex. These experiments showed that groups of spatially segregated neurons engage in synchronous oscillatory activity when activated by visual stimuli. The frequency of these oscillations was in the range of 40&amp;nbsp;Hz and differed from the periodic activation induced by the grating, suggesting that the oscillations and their synchronization were due to internal neuronal interactions.&lt;ref name="Gray 1989"/&gt; Similar findings were shown in parallel by the group of Eckhorn, providing further evidence for the functional role of neural synchronization in feature binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  vauthors = Eckhorn R, Bauer R, Jordan W, Brosch M, Kruse W, Munk M, Reitboeck HJ | journal = Biol Cybern | volume = 60  | issue = 2 | title = Coherent oscillations: A mechanism of feature linking in the visual cortex?

Gilles Laurent and colleagues showed that oscillatory synchronization has an important functional role in odor perception. Perceiving different odors leads to different subsets of neurons firing on different sets of oscillatory cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wehr M, Laurent G | title = Odour encoding by temporal sequences of firing in oscillating neural assemblies | journal = Nature | volume = 384 | pages = 162–166 | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1038/384162a0 | pmid = 8906790 | issue = 6605 | bibcode = 1996Natur.384..162W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These oscillations can be disrupted by [[GABA]] blocker [[picrotoxin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacLeod K, Laurent G | title = Distinct mechanisms for synchronization and temporal patterning of odor-encoding neural assemblies  | journal = Science | volume = 274 | pages = 976–979 | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1126/science.274.5289.976 | pmid = 8875938 | issue = 5289 | bibcode = 1996Sci...274..976M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the disruption of the oscillatory synchronization leads to impairment of behavioral discrimination of chemically similar odorants in bees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stopfer M, Bhagavan S, Smith BH, Laurent G | title = Impaired odour discrimination on desynchronization of odour-encoding neural assemblies | journal = Nature | volume = 390 | pages = 70–74 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1038/36335 | pmid = 9363891 | issue = 6655 | bibcode = 1997Natur.390...70S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to more similar responses across odors in downstream β-lobe neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacLeod K, Bäcker A, Laurent G | title = Who reads temporal information contained across synchronized and oscillatory spike trains? | journal = Nature | volume = 395 | pages = 693–698 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1038/27201 | pmid = 9790189 | issue = 6703 | bibcode = 1998Natur.395..693M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent follow-up of this work has shown that oscillations create periodic integration windows for [[Kenyon cell]]s in the insect [[Mushroom bodies|mushroom body]], such that incoming spikes from the [[antennal lobe]] are more effective in activating Kenyon cells only at specific phases of the oscillatory cycle.&lt;ref name="Gupta2016" /&gt;

Oscillations have been commonly reported in the motor system.

=== Memory ===
{{main|Memory}}

Neural oscillations, in particular [[Theta rhythm|theta]] activity, are extensively linked to memory function. Theta rhythms are very strong in rodent hippocampi and entorhinal cortex during learning and memory retrieval, and they are believed to be vital to the induction of [[long-term potentiation]], a potential cellular mechanism for learning and memory. [[Coupling (physics)|Coupling]] between theta and [[gamma wave|gamma]] activity is thought to be vital for memory functions, including [[episodic memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Buszaki G | title = Rhythms of the brain | year = 2006 | publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nyhus E, Curran T | title = Functional role of gamma and theta oscillations in episodic memory | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 34 | issue = 7 | pages = 1023–35 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20060015 | pmc = 2856712 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.12.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tight coordination of single-neuron spikes with local theta oscillations is linked to successful memory formation in humans, as more stereotyped spiking predicts better memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutishauser U, Ross IB, Mamelak AN, Schuman EM | title = Human memory strength is predicted by theta-frequency phase-locking of single neurons | journal = Nature | volume = 464 | issue = 7290 | pages = 903–7 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20336071 | doi = 10.1038/nature08860 | bibcode = 2010Natur.464..903R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sleep and consciousness ===
{{main|Sleep}}

Sleep is a naturally recurring state characterized by reduced or absent [[consciousness]] and proceeds in cycles of [[rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement]] (REM) and [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|non-rapid eye movement]] (NREM) sleep. Sleep stages are characterized by spectral content of [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]: for instance, stage N1 refers to the transition of the brain from alpha waves (common in the awake state) to theta waves, whereas stage N3 (deep or slow-wave sleep) is characterized by the presence of delta waves. The normal order of sleep stages is N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM.

=== Development ===

Neural oscillations may play a role in neural development. For example, [[retinal waves]] are thought to have properties that define early connectivity of circuits and synapses between cells in the retina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feller|first=Marla B|date=2009-07-06|title=Retinal waves are likely to instruct the formation of eye-specific retinogeniculate projections|journal=Neural Development|volume=4|pages=24|doi=10.1186/1749-8104-4-24|issn=1749-8104|pmc=2706239|pmid=19580682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spike-waves.png|thumb|Generalized 3 Hz spike and wave discharges reflecting [[seizure]] activity]]

Specific types of neural oscillations may also appear in pathological situations, such as [[Parkinson's disease]] or [[epilepsy]]. These pathological oscillations often consist of an aberrant version of a normal oscillation. For example, one of the best known types is the [[spike and wave]] oscillation, which is typical of generalized or absence epileptic seizures, and which resembles normal sleep spindle oscillations.

=== Tremor ===
{{main|Tremor}}

A tremor is an involuntary, somewhat rhythmic, muscle contraction and relaxation involving to-and-fro movements of one or more body parts. It is the most common of all involuntary movements and can affect the hands, arms, eyes, face, head, vocal cords, trunk, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. In some people, tremor is a symptom of another neurological disorder. Many different forms of tremor have been identified, such as [[essential tremor]] or [[Parkinsonism|Parkinsonian]] tremor. It is argued that tremors are likely to be multifactorial in origin, with contributions from neural oscillations in the central nervous systems, but also from peripheral mechanisms such as reflex loop resonances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McAuley JH, Marsden CD | title = Physiological and pathological tremors and rhythmic central motor control | journal = Brain | volume = 123 | year = 2000 | pages = 1545–1567 | doi = 10.1093/brain/123.8.1545 | pmid = 10908186 | issue = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thalamic loss of input allows the frequency of the thalamo-cortical column to slow into the theta or delta band as identified by MEG and EEG by machine learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vanneste S, Song JJ, De Ridder D | title = Thalamocortical dysrhythmia detected by machine learning | language = En | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 1103 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29549239 | pmc = 5856824 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-018-02820-0 | bibcode = 2018NatCo...9.1103V }}&lt;/ref&gt; TCD can be treated with [[neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] methods like [[thalamotomy]].

== Applications ==

=== Clinical endpoints ===
Neural oscillations are sensitive to several drugs influencing brain activity; accordingly, [[biomarker]]s based on neural oscillations are emerging as [[Clinical endpoint|secondary endpoints]] in clinical trials and in quantifying effects in pre-clinical studies. These biomarkers are often named "EEG biomarkers" or "Neurophysiological Biomarkers" and are quantified using [[Quantitative electroencephalography|Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG)]]. EEG biomarkers can be extracted from the EEG using the open-source [[Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox]].

=== Brain–computer interface ===
{{main|Brain–computer interface}}

Neural oscillation has been applied as a control signal in various [[brain–computer interface]]s (BCIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Birbaumer | first=Neils | year=2006 | title=Breaking the silence: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication and motor control | journal=Psychophysiology | pmid=17076808 | volume=43 | issue=6 | pages=517–32 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2006.00456.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a non-invasive BCI interface can be created by placing electrodes on the scalp and then measuring the weak electric signals. Although individual neuron activities cannot be recovered through non-invasive BCI because the skull damps and blurs the electromagnetic signals, oscillatory activity can still be reliably detected. In particular, some forms of BCI allow users to control a device by measuring the amplitude of oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands, including [[Mu wave|mu]] and [[Beta wave|beta]] rhythms.

[[OLE for process control|OPC]] is used by automation professionals for secure data transfer and process control.  One OPC specification from the [[OPC Foundation]] is '''OPC Xi (OPC Express Interface)'''. OPC Xi defines a .NET interface with the combined functionality of OPC DA, HDA, AE and a rather simple data model. [[OPC Unified Architecture]] in comparison allows the same functionality, including a .NET interface and a similar data model to OPC DA, HDA, and AE, but also supports platform independence and optionally complex information modeling capabilities.

==What is OPC Xi?==
OPC Xi can securely transport data among automation applications on separate computers. It can only run in .NET environments and thus not in all plant network environments.  To transport data, Classic OPC relies on [[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]], however OPC Xi works with [[Windows Communication Foundation]].  This means that [[Managed code]] applications don’t need a .NET wrapper for DCOM interoperation, but a wrapper from COM to .NET on the server, adding complexity to the server environment.

==OPC Xi and Networks==
The use of WCF allows OPC Xi to be functional with small and large networks.  OPC Xi can be configured for communication across firewalls and [[Network Address Translation|Network Address Translation (NAT)]].

==Security and OPC Xi==
In addition to the security implied in WCF (authentication, authorization and encryption), OPC Xi has additional security measures that restrict write, read, and subscribe access to servers.  This is done based on authentication and protocol of the client application that is attempting to access the server using [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|http]] or [[Transmission Control Protocol|tcp]].

==OPC Xi Specification==
The OPC Xi specification is defined in a Windows Helpfile. Different versions of this file without obvious version information are available from [http://opcfoundation.org/ OPC Foundation official website.]

The '''P-type ATPases''', also known as '''E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ATPases''', are a large group of evolutionarily related [[ion pump|ion]] and lipid pumps that are found in [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], and [[eukaryotes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Palmgren MG, Nissen P |title=P-type ATPases. |journal=Annu. Rev. Biophys. |volume=40 |pages=243–66 |date=2011 |pmid=21351879 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.093008.131331 |url=http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/users/stansfeld/10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; P-type [[ATPase]]s are α-helical bundle [[active transport|primary transporters]] named based upon their ability to catalyze auto- (or self-) [[phosphorylation]] (hence P) of a key conserved [[aspartate]] residue within the pump and their energy source, [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). In addition, they all appear to interconvert between at least two different conformations, denoted by E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name = "Pedersen_1987"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0968-0004(87)90071-5 |title=Ion motive ATPases. I.

Most members of this transporter superfamily catalyze cation uptake and/or efflux, however one subfamily ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.A.3.8 TC# 3.A.3.8]) is involved in flipping [[phospholipids]] to maintain the asymmetric nature of the [[biomembrane]].

In humans, P-type ATPases serve as a basis for [[Action potential|nerve impulses]], relaxation of muscles, [[Renal function|secretion and absorption in the kidney]], absorption of nutrient in the intestine and other physiological processes. Prominent examples of P-type ATPases are the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pump]] (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase), the [[Hydrogen potassium ATPase|proton-potassium pump]] (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase), the [[SERCA|calcium pump]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase) and the [[Plasma membrane H+-ATPase|plasma membrane proton pump]] (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase) of plants and fungi.

== General transport reaction ==

The generalized reaction for P-type ATPases is:

nLigand&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (out) + mLigand&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (in) + ATP → nLigang&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (in) + mLigand&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (out) + ADP + P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.

where the ligand can be either a metal ion or a phospholipid molecule.

== Discovery ==

The first P-type ATPase discovered was the [[sodium potassium ATPase|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase]], which [[Nobel laureate]] [[Jens Christian Skou]] isolated in 1957.&lt;ref name="skou"&gt;{{cite journal |author=SKOU JC |title=The influence of some cations on an adenosine triphosphatase from peripheral nerves |journal=Biochim. Biophys. Acta |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=394–401 |date=February 1957 |pmid=13412736 |doi= 10.1016/0006-3002(57)90343-8|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase was only the first member of a large and still-growing protein family (see [[Swiss-Prot]] [https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=(PS00154)+AND+reviewed:yes Prosite motif PS00154]).

== Structure ==

P-type ATPases have a single catalytic subunit of 70 - 140 kDa. The catalytic subunit hydrolyzes ATP, contain the aspartyl phosphorylation site and binding sites for the transported ligand(s) and catalyzes ion transport. Various subfamilies of P-type ATPases also need additional subunits for proper function. Additional subunits that lack catalytic activity are present in the ATPase complexes of P1A, P2A, P2C and P4 ATPases. E.g. the catalytic alpha subunit of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase consists of two additional subunits, beta and gamma, involved in trafficking, folding, and regulation of these pumps. The first P-type ATPase to be crystallized was [[SERCA|SERCA1a]], a [[Endoplasmic reticulum#Sarcoplasmic reticulum|sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum]] Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase of [[fast twitch muscle]] from adult [[rabbit]].&lt;ref  name="Toyoshima"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Toyoshima C, Nakasako M, Nomura H, Ogawa H |title=Crystal structure of the calcium pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum at 2.6 A resolution |journal=Nature |volume=405 |issue=6787 |pages=647–55 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10864315 |doi=10.1038/35015017 |url=|bibcode=2000Natur.405..647T }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally acknowledged that the structure of [[SERCA|SERCA1a]] is representative for the superfamily of P-type ATPases.&lt;ref name="Stokes"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stokes DL, Green NM |title=Structure and function of the calcium pump |journal=Annu Rev Biophys Biomol Struct |volume=32 |issue= |pages=445–68 |year=2003 |pmid=12598367 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.32.110601.142433 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The catalytic subunit of P-type ATPases is composed of a [[cytoplasmic]] section and a [[transmembrane]] section with binding sites for the transported ligand(s). The cytoplasmic section consists of three cytoplasmic domains, designated the P, N, and A domains, containing over half the mass of the protein. 
 
===Membrane section===
The transmembrane section (&lt;u&gt;M domain&lt;/u&gt;) typically has ten [[transmembrane protein|transmembrane helices]] (M1-M10), with the binding sites for transported ligand(s) located near the midpoint of the bilayer. While most subfamilies have 10 transmembrane helices, there are some notable exceptions. The P1A ATPases are predicted to have 7, and the large subfamily of heavy metal pumps P1B) is predicted to have 8 transmembrane helices. P5 ATPases appear to have a total of 12 transmembrane helices.

Common for all P-type ATPases is a core of 6 transmembrane-spanning segments (also called the 'transport (T) domain'; M1-M6 in SERCA), that harbors the binding sites for the translocated ligand(s). The ligand(s) enter through a half-channel to the binding site and leave on the other side of the membrane through another half-channel.

Varying among P-type ATPase is the additional number of transmembrane-spanning segments (also called the 'support (S) domain', which between subfamilies ranges from 2 to 6. Extra transmembrane-segments likely provides structural support for the T domain and can also have specialized functions.

===Phosphorylation (P) domain===

The P domain contains the canonical aspartic acid residue phosphorylated (in a conserved DKTGT motif; the 'D' is the one letter abbreviation of the amino acid aspartate) during the reaction cycle. It is composed of two parts widely separated in sequence. These two parts assemble into a seven-strand parallel β-sheet with eight short associated a-helices, forming a [[Rossmann fold]].

The folding pattern and the locations of the critical amino acids for phosphorylation in P-type ATPases has the haloacid dehalogenase fold characteristic of the [[Haloacid dehydrogenase superfamily|haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily]], as predicted by sequence homology. The HAD superfamily functions on the common theme of an aspartate ester formation by an [[SN2 reaction|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction]] mechanism. This [[SN2 reaction|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction]] is clearly observed in the solved structure of SERCA with [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] plus AlF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="pmid15192230"&gt;{{PDB|1T5T}}; {{cite journal |vauthors=Sørensen TL, Møller JV, Nissen P | title = Phosphoryl transfer and calcium ion occlusion in the calcium pump | journal = Science | volume = 304 | issue = 5677 | pages = 1672–5 |date=June 2004 | pmid = 15192230 | doi = 10.1126/science.1099366 | url =  | bibcode = 2004Sci...304.1672S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nucleotide binding (N) domain===

The N domain serves as a built-in protein kinase that functions to phosphorylate the P domain. The N domain is inserted between the two segments of the P domain, and is formed of a seven-strand antiparallel β-sheet between two helix bundles. This domain contains the ATP-binding pocket, pointing out toward the solvent near the P-domain.

===Actuator (A) domain===

The A domain serves as a built-in protein phosphatase that functions to dephosphorylate the phosphorylated P domain. The A domain is the smallest of the three cytoplasmic domains. It consists of a distorted jellyroll structure and two short helices. It is the actuator domain modulating the occlusion of the transported ligand(s) in the transmembrane binding sites, and it is pivot in transposing the energy from the hydrolysis of ATP in the cytoplasmic domains to the vectorial transport of cations in the transmembrane domain. The A domain dephosphorylates the P domain as part of the reaction cycle using a highly conserved TGES motif located at one end of the jellyroll.

===Regulatory (R) domain===

Some members of the P-type ATPase family have additional regulatory (R) domains fused to the pump. Heavy metal P1B pumps can have several N- and C-terminal [[HMA domain|heavy metal-binding domains]] that have been found to be involved in regulation. The P2B Ca&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; ATPases have autoinbitory domains in their amino-terminal (plants) or carboxy-terminal (animals) regions, which contain binding sites for [[calmodulin]], which, in the presence of Ca&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;, activates P2B ATPases by neutralizing the terminal constraint. The P3A plasma membrane proton pumps have a C-terminal regulatory domain, which, when unphosphorylated, inhibits pumping.

== Mechanism  ==

All P-type ATPases use the energy derived from [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to drive transport. They form a high-energy aspartyl-phosphoanhydride intermediate in the reaction cycle, and they interconvert between at least two different conformations, denoted by E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; notation stems from the initial studies on this family of enzymes made on the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase, where the sodium form and the potassium form are referred to as E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, in the "Post-Albers scheme". The E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; schema has been proven to work, but there exist more than two major conformational states. The E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; notation highlights the selectivity of the [[enzyme]]. In E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the pump has high affinity for the exported substrate and low affinity for the imported substrate. In E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it has low affinity of the exported substrate and high affinity for the imported substrate. Four major enzyme states form the cornerstones in the reaction cycle. Several additional reaction intermediates occur interposed. These are termed E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;~P, E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P, E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-P*, and E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Olesen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Olesen C |title=The structural basis of calcium transport by the calcium pump |journal=Nature |volume=450 |issue=7172 |pages=1036–42 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18075584 |doi=10.1038/nature06418 |url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Picard M |author3=Winther AM |display-authors=3 |last4=Gyrup |first4=Claus |last5=Morth |first5=J. Preben |last6=Oxvig |first6=Claus |last7=Møller |first7=Jesper Vuust |last8=Nissen |first8=Poul|bibcode=2007Natur.450.1036O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATP hydrolysis occurs in the cytoplasmic headpiece at the interface between domain N and P. Two Mg-ion sites form part of the active site. ATP hydrolysis is tightly coupled to translocation of the transported ligand(s) through the membrane, more than 40 Å away, by the A domain.

==Classification==
A [[phylogenetic]] analysis of 159 sequences made in 1998 by Axelsen and Palmgren suggested that P-type ATPases can be divided into five subfamilies (types; designated as P1-P5), based strictly on a conserved sequence kernel excluding the highly variable N and C terminal regions.&lt;ref name="Axelsen"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Axelsen KB, Palmgren MG |title=Evolution of substrate specificities in the P-type ATPase superfamily |journal=J.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[phylogenetic]] analysis grouped the proteins independent of the organism from which they are isolated and showed that the diversification of the P-type ATPase family occurred prior to the separation of [[eubacteria]], [[archaea]], and [[eucaryota]]. This underlines the significance of this protein family for cell survival under stress conditions.&lt;ref name="Axelsen"/&gt;

==P1 ATPases==
P1 ATPases ATPases (or Type I) consists of the transition/heavy metal ATPases. Topological type I (heavy metal) P-type ATPases predominate in prokaryotes (approx. tenfold).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===P1A ATPases (potassium pumps)===

P1A ATPases (or Type IA) are involved in K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; import ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.A.3.7 TC# 3.A.3.7]). They are atypical P-type ATPases because, unlike other P-type ATPases, they function as part of a heterotetrameric complex (called [[KdpFABC]]), where the actual K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport is mediated by another subcomponent of the complex.

===P1B ATPases (heavy metal pumps)===
{{Main|Zn2+-exporting ATPase}}
{{Main|ATP7A}}
{{Main|Wilson disease protein}}

P1B ATPases (or Type IB ATPases) are involved in transport of the [[lewis acid|soft Lewis acids]]: Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (TC#s [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.A.3.5 3.A.3.5] and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.A.3.6 3.A.3.6]). They are key elements for metal resistance and metal homeostasis in a wide range of organisms.

[[Metal]] binding to transmembrane metal-binding sites (TM-MBS) in Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPases is required for enzyme phosphorylation and subsequent transport.

Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-loaded MBDs, acting as metal donors, were unable to activate CopA or a truncated CopA lacking MBDs. Conversely, Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-loaded CopZ activated the CopA ATPase and CopA constructs in which MBDs were rendered unable to bind Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, under nonturnover conditions, CopZ transferred Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the TM-MBS of a CopA lacking MBDs altogether. Thus, MBDs may serve a regulatory function without participating directly in metal transport, and the chaperone delivers Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; directly to transmembrane transport sites of Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPases.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Wu et al. (2008) have determined structures of two constructs of the Cu (CopA) pump from ''Archaeoglobus fulgidus'' by [[Cryo-electron microscopy|cryoelectron microscopy]] of tubular crystals, which revealed the overall architecture and domain organization of the molecule. They localized its N-terminal MBD within the cytoplasmic domains that use ATP hydrolysis to drive the transport cycle and built a pseudoatomic model by fitting existing crystallographic structures into the cryoelectron microscopy maps for CopA. The results also similarly suggested a Cu-dependent regulatory role for the MBD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In the ''Archaeoglobus fulgidus'' CopA ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.A.3.5.7 TC# 3.A.3.5.7]), invariant residues in helixes 6, 7 and 8 form two transmembrane metal binding sites (TM-MBSs). These bind Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with high affinity in a trigonal planar geometry. The cytoplasmic Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; chaperone CopZ transfers the metal directly to the TM-MBSs; however, loading both of the TM-MBSs requires binding of nucleotides to the enzyme. In agreement with the classical transport mechanism of P-type ATPases, occupancy of both transmembrane sites by cytoplasmic Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is a requirement for enzyme phosphorylation and subsequent transport into the periplasmic or extracellular milieu. Transport studies have shown that most Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPases drive cytoplasmic Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux, albeit with quite different transport rates in tune with their various physiological roles. Archetypical Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-efflux pumps responsible for Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tolerance, like the ''Escherichia coli'' CopA, have turnover rates ten times higher than those involved in cuproprotein assembly (or alternative functions). This explains the incapability of the latter group to significantly contribute to the metal efflux required for survival in high copper environments.  Structural and mechanistic details of copper-transporting P-type ATPase functionhave been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==P2 ATPases==
P2 ATPases (or Type II ATPases) are split into four groups. Topological type II ATPases (specific for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and phospholipids) predominate in eukaryotes (approx. twofold).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===P2A ATPases (calcium pumps)===
{{Main|SERCA}}
{{Main|ATP2A1}}
{{Main|Secretory Pathway Ca²⁺ ATPase}}
{{Main|Calcium pump}}
{{Main|Calcium ATPase}}

P2A ATPases (or Type IIA ATPases) are [[Calcium ATPase|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPases]] that transport Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. P2A ATPases are split into two groups. Members of the first group are called [[SERCA|sarco/endoplasmatic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPases]] (also referred to as SERCA). These pumps have two Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion binding sites and are often regulated by inhibitory accessory proteins having a single trans-membrane spanning segment (e.g.[[phospholamban]] and [[sarcolipin]]. In the cell, they are located in the [[Sarcoplasmic reticulum|sarcoplasmic]]  or [[Endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmatic]] reticulum. [[SERCA|SERCA1a]] is a type IIA pump. The second group of P2A ATPases is called [[Secretory Pathway Ca²⁺ ATPase|secretory pathway Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPases]] (also referred to as SPCA). These pumps have a single Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion binding site and are located in secretory vesicles (animals) or the vacuolar membrane (fungi). (TC# 3.A.3.2)

Crystal structures of Sarcoplasimc/endoplasmic reticulum ATP driven calcium pumps can be found in RCSB.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/results/results.do?outformat=&amp;qrid=EC521F52&amp;tabtoshow=Current&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SERCA|SERCA1a]] is composed of a [[cytoplasmic]] section and a [[transmembrane]] section with two Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding sites. The cytoplasmic section consists of three cytoplasmic domains, designated the P, N, and A domains, containing over half the mass of the protein. The transmembrane section has ten [[transmembrane protein|transmembrane helices]] (M1-M10), with the two Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding sites located near the midpoint of the bilayer. The binding sites are formed by side-chains and backbone carbonyls from M4, M5, M6, and M8. M4 is unwound in this region due to a conserved proline (P308). This unwinding of M4 is recognised as a key structural feature of P-type ATPases.

Structures are available for both the E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; states of the [[Calcium ATPase|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase]] showing that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding induces major changes in all three cytoplasmic domains relative to each other.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal

In the case of [[SERCA|SERCA1a]], energy from [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is used to transport 2 Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ions from the [[cytoplasmic]] side to the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the [[sarcoplasmatic reticulum]], and to countertransport 1-3 protons into the [[cytoplasm]]. Starting in the E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; state, the reaction cycle begins as the enzyme releases 1-3 protons from the cation-ligating residues, in exchange for cytoplasmic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ions. This leads to assembly of the phosphorylation site between the ATP-bound N domain and the P domain, while the A domain directs the occlusion of the bound Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In this occluded state, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are buried in a proteinaceous environment with no access to either side of the membrane.The Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;~P state becomes formed through a kinase reaction, where the P domain becomes phosphorylated, producing ADP. The cleavage of the β-phosphodiester bond releases the gamma-phosphate from ADP and unleashes the N domain from the P domain.

This then allows the A domain to rotate toward the phosphorylation site, making a firm association with both the P and the N domains. This movement of the A domain exerts a downward push on M3-M4 and a drag on M1-M2, forcing the pump to open at the luminal side and forming the E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P state. During this transition, the transmembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding residues are forced apart, destroying the high-affinity binding site. This is in agreement with the general model form substrate translocation, showing that energy in primary transport is not used to bind the substrate but to release it again from the buried counter ions. At the same time the N domain becomes exposed to the cytosol, ready for ATP exchange at the nucleotide-binding site.

As the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dissociate to the luminal side, the cation binding sites are neutralised by proton binding, which makes a closure of the transmembrane segments favourable. This closure is coupled to a downward rotation of the A domain and a movement of the P domain, which then leads to the E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-P* occluded state. Meanwhile, the N domain exchanges ADP for ATP.

The P domain is dephosphorylated by the A domain, and the cycle completes when the phosphate is released from the enzyme, stimulated by the newly bound ATP, while a cytoplasmic pathway opens to exchange the protons for two new Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ions.&lt;ref name="Olesen"/&gt;

Xu et al. proposed how Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding induces conformational changes in TMS 4 and 5 in the membrane domain (M) that in turn induce rotation of the phosphorylation domain (P).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The nucleotide binding (N) and β-sheet (β) domains are highly mobile, with N flexibly linked to P, and β flexibly linked to M. Modeling of the fungal H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase, based on the structures of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; pump, suggested a comparable 70º rotation of N relative to P to deliver ATP to the phosphorylation site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In addition to the subfamilies of P-type ATPases listed above, several prokaryotic families of unknown function have been identified.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.A.3.9 Transporter Classification Database] provides a representative list of members of the P-ATPase superfamily, which as of early 2016 consisting of 20 families. Members of the P-ATPase superfamily are found in [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[eukaryote]]s. Clustering on the [[phylogenetic tree]] is usually in accordance with specificity for the transported ion(s).

In eukaryotes, they are present in the plasma membranes or [[Endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmic reticular]] membranes. In prokaryotes, they are localized to the cytoplasmic membranes.

P-type ATPases from 26 eukaryotic species were analyzed later.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal

Chan et al., (2010) conducted an equivalent but more extensive analysis of the P-type ATPase Superfamily in Prokaryotes and compared them with those from Eukaryotes. While some families are represented in both types of organisms, others are found only in one of the other type. The primary functions of prokaryotic P-type ATPases appear to be protection from environmental stress conditions. Only about half of the P-type ATPase families are functionally characterized.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=Henry|last2=Babayan|first2=Vartan|last3=Blyumin|first3=Elya|last4=Gandhi|first4=Charmy|last5=Hak|first5=Kunal|last6=Harake|first6=Danielle|last7=Kumar|first7=Kris|last8=Lee|first8=Perry|last9=Li|first9=Tze T.|date=2010-01-01|title=The p-type ATPase superfamily|journal=Journal of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology|volume=19|issue=1–2|pages=5–104|doi=10.1159/000319588|issn=1660-2412|pmid=20962537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horizontal Gene Transfer ===
Many P-type ATPase families are found exclusively in prokaryotes (e.g. Kdp-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake ATPases (type III) and all prokaryotic functionally uncharacterized P-type ATPase (FUPA) families), while others are restricted to eukaryotes (e.g. [[Flippase|phospholipid flippases]] and all 13 eukaryotic FUPA families).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Horizontal gene transfer]] has occurred frequently among bacteria and archaea, which have similar distributions of these [[enzyme]]s, but rarely between most eukaryotic kingdoms, and even more rarely between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In some bacterial [[Phylum|phyla]] (e.g. [[Bacteroidetes]], [[Flavobacteriia|Flavobacteria]] and [[Fusobacterium|Fusobacteria]]), ATPase gene gain and loss as well as horizontal transfer occurred seldom in contrast to most other bacterial phyla. Some families (i.e., Kdp-type ATPases) underwent far less horizontal gene transfer than other prokaryotic families, possibly due to their multisubunit characteristics. Functional motifs are better conserved across family lines than across organismal lines, and these motifs can be family specific, facilitating functional predictions. In some cases, gene fusion events created P-type ATPases covalently linked to regulatory catalytic enzymes. In one family (FUPA Family 24), a type I ATPase gene (N-terminal) is fused to a type II ATPase gene (C-terminal) with retention of function only for the latter. Genome minimalization led to preferential loss of P-type ATPase genes. Chan et al. (2010) suggested that in prokaryotes and some unicellular eukaryotes, the primary function of P-type ATPases is protection from extreme environmental stress conditions. The classification of P-type ATPases of unknown function into phylogenetic families provides guides for future molecular biological studies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Passive survivability''' refers to the building's ability to maintain critical life-support conditions in the event of extended loss of power, heating fuel, or water.&lt;ref&gt;"Passive Survivability." NJ Green Building Manual. 28 Apr. 2011. Web. 3 Dec. 2014.&lt;http://greenmanual.rutgers.edu/newcommercial/strategies/survivability.pdf&gt;.[http://greenmanual.rutgers.edu/newcommercial/strategies/survivability.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This is proposing that in a disaster situation whether it be a storm that causes a power outage and is unable to keep the interior of the building cool in severe climates, a drought which limits water supply, or the gas pipes get disconnected and the building is without gas, designers should incorporate ways in which the building is then capable of continuing to shelter the inhabitants for an extended period of time.

The term was coined by BuildingGreen President and EBN Executive editor Alex Wilson in 2005 after the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;Quinion, Michael. "World Wide Words: Passive Survivability." World Wide Words. 5 Aug. 2003. Web. 2 Dec. 2014.&lt;http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-pas1.htm&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-pas1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Passive Survivability is suggested to become a standard in the design criteria for houses, apartment buildings, and certain other building types. While many of the strategies considered to achieve the goals of passive survivability are not a new concept and is widely known and used throughout the decades of green building, the distinction comes from the motivation for moving towards high-performance and renewable power design buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Alex. "Passive Survivability." - GreenSource Magazine. 1 June 2006. Web. 3 Dec. 2014.&lt;{{cite web |url=http://greensource.construction.com/people/0606mag-opinions.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209112335/http://greensource.construction.com/people/0606mag-opinions.asp |archivedate=2014-12-09 |df= }}&gt;. {{cite web |url=http://greensource.construction.com/people/0606mag-opinions.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209112335/http://greensource.construction.com/people/0606mag-opinions.asp |archivedate=2014-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
In much of the urban world with populated cities and residential areas, there is a heavy reliance on a grid for power and gas. These grids are the hub of energy for many of these societies and while they generally do not get interrupted, they are constantly prone to elements which may cause disruption. These potential hindrances can occur from a multitude of conditions ranging from natural disasters, extreme climates, and acts of man. Passive survivability aims to be prepared for when such an event may occur. One of the issues that passive survivability looks at is how to increase ventilation flow throughout a building so that a building can stay oxygenated while keeping the interior temperature regulated. Another is considering the many ways to keep [[thermal resistance]] of a building skin to prevent a room from becoming overbearing in the event of having a lack of access to standard temperature regulating systems. Key sources such as power lines, telephone lines, water pipelines, electricity boxes, or fuel pipelines, are potentially fragile components that can be and is often disrupted during such adversities as earthquakes, storms, and extreme weather. Other factors to be mindful of when applying passive survivability are:&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Alex. "Passive Survivability." Building Green. Efficiency Vermont, 8 Feb. 2008. Web. 3 Dec. 2014.&lt;http://www.efficiencyvermont.com/Docs/for_partners/bbd_presentations/2008/Passive{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Survivability_Wilson.pdf&gt;. [http://www.efficiencyvermont.com/Docs/for_partners/bbd_presentations/2008/Passive%20Survivability_Wilson.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Intense earthquakes
*Intense storms
*Flooding
*Extreme temperature
*Drought
*Risk of terrorism
*Blackouts or shortage of electricity
*Shortage or cutoff of fuel
*Shortage of water

==Strategies==

The over arching goal of passive survivability is to try to reduce discomfort or suffering in the event of having a key source cut off to a building. There are several different solutions to any one design problem. While many of the solutions that are presented by advocates of passive survivability are ones that have been universally accepted by passive design and other standard sustainability practices, it is important to look over these measures and apply the appropriate strategies to developing and existing buildings in order to minimize the risk of displeasure or death.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Alex. "Mandate Passive Survivability in Building Codes." Mandate Passive Survivability in Building Codes. Finehomebuilding.com, 14 May 2008. Web. 3 Dec. 2014.&lt;http://www.finehomebuilding.com/how-to/departments/cross-section/mandate-passive-survivability-in-building-codes.aspx&gt;. [http://www.finehomebuilding.com/how-to/departments/cross-section/mandate-passive-survivability-in-building-codes.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

Buildings should be designed to maintain survivable thermal conditions without air conditioning or supplemental heat. Providing back-up generators and adequate fuel to maintain the critical functions of a building during outages are conventional solutions to power-supply interruptions. Indeed, generators need to be part of the answer in some situations, such as hospitals. However, unless they are very large, generators support only basic needs for a short amount of time and may not power systems such as air conditioning, lighting, or even heating or ventilation during extended outages. Back-up generators are also expensive both to buy and maintain. Storing significant quantities of fuel on-site to power generators during extended outages has inherent environmental and safety risks, particularly during storms. Passive solutions, such as designing highly efficient building envelopes, providing natural ventilation and day-lighting, and incorporating passive solar design can also contribute to a facility’s passive survivability. Renewable energy systems can provide power during an extreme event . For example, photovoltaic (or solar electric) power systems, when coupled with on-site battery storage can provide electricity when the grid loses power. Emergency water supply systems such as rooftop rainwater harvest systems can provide water for toilet flushing, bathing and other building needs in the event of water supply interruptions. The list below outlines aspects of a building’s design that should be taken into consideration when planning for passive survivability.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Alex. "Passive Survivability." Building Green. Efficiency Vermont, 8 Feb. 2008. Web. 3 Dec. 2014.&lt;http://www.efficiencyvermont.com/Docs/for_partners/bbd_presentations/2008/Passive{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Survivability_Wilson.pdf&gt;.

A '''prairie remnant''' commonly refers to grassland areas in the [[Western United States|Western]] and [[Midwestern United States]] and [[Canada]] that remain to some extent [[remnant natural area|undisturbed by European settlement]]. Prairie remnants range in levels of degradation but nearly all contain at least some semblance of the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] local [[plant community|plant assemblage]] of a particular region. Prairie remnants have become increasingly threatened due to the threats of agricultural, urban and suburban development, pollution, [[Fire_ecology#Some_examples_of_fire_in_different_ecosystems|fire]] suppression, and the incursion of invasive species.&lt;ref name=packard1997&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Packard |editor-first1=Stephen |editor-link1=Stephen Packard |editor-last2=Mutel |editor-first2=Cornelia F.|editor-link2=Cornelia Mutel |date=1997 |title=The Tallgrass Restoration Handbook: For Prairies, Savannas, and Woodlands |publisher=Island Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=greenberg2004&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of the Chicago Region |last=Greenberg |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Greenberg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXA1VVOSUg4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Natural+History+of+the+Chicago+Region&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=qendTdPdB5GCsQOx3fGiBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=warren%20woods&amp;f=false |year=2004 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-30649-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prairie remnants in restoration ecology ==
Prairie remnants offer valuable varieties of rare species thus providing excellent opportunities for [[restoration ecology]] projects. Many restoration projects are simply recreations of prairie habitats, but restoring prairie remnants provides the preservation of more complete ecological structures that were naturally created after the end of the last ice age. Remnants can also serve as platforms for additional surrounding [[ecological restoration]] activities.&lt;ref name=greenberg2004/&gt;

== Tallgrass prairies in North America ==
It has been estimated that 99% of [[tallgrass prairie]] habitats in North America have been destroyed mainly due to conversion to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Crescent_Lake/what_we_do/resource_management/prairies.html Crescent Lake Wildlife Refuge, Nebraska] U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, Retrieved 29 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Tallgrass prairies are generally composed of a mixture of native grasses, sedges, and forbs but are usually dominated by grasses.

== Shortgrass prairies in North America ==
The [[shortgrass prairie]] is an ecosystem located in the [[Great Plains]] of North America. The prairie includes lands to the west as far as the eastern foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and extends east as far as [[Nebraska]] and north into [[Saskatchewan]]. The prairie stretches through parts of Alberta, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Kansas, and passes south through the high plains of Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico.

'''Reflective writing''' is an [[analysis|analytical]] practice in which the writer describes a real or imaginary scene, event, interaction, passing thought, memory, form, adding a personal reflection on the meaning of the item or incident, thought, feeling, emotion, or situation in his or her life. Many reflective writers keep in mind questions, such as "What did I notice?", "How has this changed me?" or "What might I have done differently?".

Thus, the focus is on writing that is not merely descriptive. The writer revisits the scene to note details and emotions, reflect on meaning, examine what went well or revealed a need for additional learning, and relate what transpired to the rest of life.

Reflective writing is also analyzing the event or idea (thinking in depth and from different [[Point of view (literature)|perspectives]], and trying to explain, often with reference to a model or theory from the subject.)

'''Secondary succession''' is one of the two types [[ecological succession]] of a plants life. As opposed to the first, [[primary succession]], secondary succession is a process started by an event (e.g. [[forest fire]], [[harvest]]ing, [[hurricane]], etc.) that reduces an already established [[ecosystem]] (e.g. a forest or a wheat field) to a smaller population of species, and as such secondary succession occurs on preexisting [[soil]] whereas [[primary succession]] usually occurs in a place lacking soil. Many factors can affect secondary succession, such as trophic interaction, initial composition, and competition-colonization trade-offs.&lt;ref name = "Cook"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = W.M. | last2 = Yao | first2 = J. | last3 = Forster | first3 = B.L. | last4 = Holt | first4 = R.D. | last5 = Patricks | first5 = L.B. | year = 2005 | title = Secondary succession in an experimentally fragmented landscape: Community pattern across space and time | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 1267–1279 | doi=10.1890/04-0320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factors that control the increase in abundance of a species during succession may be determined mainly by seed production and dispersal, micro climate; landscape structure (habitat patch size and distance to outside seed sources);&lt;ref name = "Cook"/&gt; bulk density, pH, and soil texture (sand and clay).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van der Kamp | first1 = J. | last2 = Yassir | first2 = I. | last3 = Buurman | first3 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Soil carbon changes upon secondary succession in ''Imperata'' grasslands (East Kalimantan, Indonesia) | url = | journal = Geoderma | volume = 149 | issue = | pages = 76–83 | doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2008.11.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simply put, secondary succession is the ecological succession that occurs after the initial succession has been disrupted and some plants and animals still exist. It is usually faster than primary succession 
# [[Soil]] is already present
# [[Seeds]], [[root]]s and underground [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative organs]] of plants may still survive in the soil.

==Examples==

=== Imperata ===
[[Imperata cylindrica|''Imperata'']] grasslands are caused by human  activities such as logging, forest clearing for shifting cultivation, agriculture and grazing, and also by frequent fires. The latter is a frequent result of human interference.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, K., Hatta, G., Halim, H., Mangalik, A., 1996. Ecology of Kalimantan. The ecology of Indonesia Seri Vol. III&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when not maintained by frequent fires and human disturbances, they regenerate naturally and speedily to secondary young forest. The time of succession in ''Imperata'' grassland  (for example in Samboja Lestari area), ''Imperata cylindrica'' has the highest coverage but it becomes less dominant from the fourth year onwards. While ''Imperata'' decreases, the percentage of shrubs and young trees clearly increases with time. In the burned plots, ''Melastoma malabathricum, Eupatorium inulaefolium, Ficus'' sp., and ''Vitex pinnata''. strongly increase with the age of regeneration, but these species are commonly found in the secondary forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yassir | first1 = I. | last2 = Van der Kamp | first2 = J. | last3 = Buurman | first3 = P. | year = 2010 | title = Secondary succession after fire in Imperata grasslands of East Kalimantan, Indonesia | url = | journal = Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment | volume = 137 | issue = | pages = 172–182 | doi=10.1016/j.agee.2010.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil properties change during secondary succession in Imperata grassland area. The effects of secondary succession on soil are strongest in the A-horizon (0–10&amp;nbsp;cm), where an increase in carbon stock, N, and C/N ratio, and a decrease in bulk density and pH are observed.  Soil carbon stocks also increase upon secondary succession from ''Imperata'' grassland to secondary forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van der Kamp | first1 = J. | last2 = Yassir | first2 = I. | last3 = Buurman | first3 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Soil carbon changes upon secondary succession in Imperata grasslands (East Kalimantan, Indonesia) | url = | journal = Geoderma | volume = 149 | issue = | pages = 76–83 | doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2008.11.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Oak and hickory forest ===
A classic example of secondary succession occurs in [[oak]] and [[hickory]] forests cleared by wildfire. Wildfires will burn most vegetation and kill those animals unable to flee the area. Their nutrients, however, are returned to the ground in the form of ash. Thus, even when areas are devoid of life due to severe fires, the area will soon be ready for new life to take hold. Before the fire, the vegetation was dominated by tall trees with access to the major plant energy resource: sunlight. Their height gave them access to sunlight while also shading the ground and other low-lying species. After the fire, though, these trees are no longer dominant. Thus, the first plants to grow back are usually annual plants followed within a few years by quickly growing and spreading grasses and other pioneer species. Due to, at least in part, changes in the environment brought on by the growth of the grasses and other species, over many years, shrubs will emerge along with small pine, oak, and hickory trees. These organisms are called intermediate species. Eventually, over 150 years, the forest will reach its equilibrium point where species composition is no longer changing and resembles the community before the fire. This equilibrium state is referred to as the climax community, which will remain stable until the next disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cnx.org/contents/GFy_h8cu@10.117:d0xglyLD@4/Community-Ecology|title=45.6 Community Ecology|last=|first=|date=|website=OpenStax CNX|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soil===
Generation of carbonates from burnt plant material following fire disturbance causes an initial increase in soil pH that can affect the rate of secondary succession, as well as what types of organisms will be able to thrive. Soil composition prior to fire disturbance also influences secondary succession, both in rate and type of dominant species growth. For example, high sand concentration was found to increase the chances of primary ''Pteridium'' over ''Imperata'' growth in ''Imperata'' grassland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yassir|first1=I.|title=Secondary succession after fire in Imperata grasslands of East Kalimantan, Indonesia|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|date=15 April 2010|volume=137|pages=172–182|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2010.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The byproducts of combustion have been shown to affect secondary succession by soil microorganisms. For example, certain fungal species such as ''Trichoderma polysporum'' and ''Penicillium janthinellum'' have a significantly decreased success rate in spore germination within fire-affected areas, reducing their ability to recolonize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Widden|first1=P.|title=The effects of a forest fire on soil microfungi|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|date=March 1975|volume=7|issue=2|pages=125–138|doi=10.1016/0038-0717(75)90010-3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038071775900103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetation===
Vegetation structure is affected by fire. In some types of ecosystems this creates a process of renewal. Following a fire, early successional species disperse and establish first. This is then followed by late successional species. Species that are fire intolerant are those that are more flammable and are desolated by fire. More tolerant species are able to survive or disperse in the event of fire. The occurrence of fire leads to the establishment of deadwood and [[Snag (ecology)|snags]] in forests. This creates habitat and resources for a variety of species.
Fire can act as a seed dispersing stimulant. Many species require fire events to reproduce, disperse, and establish. For example, the knobcone pine ("Pinus attenuata") has closed cones that open for dispersal when exposed to heat caused by forest fires. This particular conifer grows in clusters because of this limited method of seed dispersal. A tough fire resistant outer bark and lack of low branches help the knobcone pine survive fire with minimal damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burczyk|first1=Jaroslaw|last2=Adams|first2=W.

The U.S. allocated $650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation, embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure. The program concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-national-automated-highway-system-that-almost-was-63027245/|title=The National Automated Highway System That Almost Was|last=Novak|first=Matt|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove {{convert|4,584|km}} across America in 1995, {{convert|4,501|km}} or 98% of it autonomously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/slideshow/back_to_the_future_autonomous_driving_in_1995/|title=Back to the Future: Autonomous Driving in 1995 – Robotics Business Review|date=2015-04-03|work=Robotics Business Review|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navlab's record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015 when Delphi improved it by piloting an  Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over {{convert|5,472|km}} through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/04/delphi-autonomous-car-cross-country/|title=This Is Big: A Robo-Car Just Drove Across the Country|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the US states of [[Nevada]], [[Florida]], [[California]], [[Virginia]], and [[Michigan]], together with [[Washington, D.C.]], allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.richmond.com/news/article_b1168b67-3b2b-5274-8914-8a3304f2e417.html|title=Self-driving cars to be tested on Virginia highways|last=Ramsey|first=John|date=1 June 2015|work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|access-date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

There is some inconsistency in terminology used in the self-driving car industry. Various organizations have proposed to define an accurate and consistent vocabulary.

Such confusion has been documented in SAE J3016 which states that "Some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving automation (level 5), while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation, and some state legislation has defined it to correspond approximately to any ADS at or above level 3 (or to any vehicle equipped with such an ADS)."

===Words definition and safety considerations===

Modern vehicles provide partly automated features such as keeping the car within its lane, speed controls or emergency braking. Nonetheless, differences remain between a fully autonomous self-driving car on one hand and [[Advanced driver-assistance systems|driver assistance technologies]] on the other hand. According to the BBC, confusion between those concepts leads to deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44159581|title=Who is to blame for 'self-driving car' deaths?|first=Theo|last=Leggett|date=22 May 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Association of British Insurers considers the usage of the word ''autonomous'' in marketing for modern cars to be dangerous, because car ads make motorists think 'autonomous' and 'autopilot' means a vehicle can drive itself, when they still rely on the driver to ensure safety. Technology alone still is not able to drive the car.

When some car makers suggest or claim vehicles are ''self-driving'', when they are only partly automated, drivers risk becoming excessively confident, leading to crashes, while fully self-driving cars are still a long way off in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44439523|title=Insurers warning on 'autonomous' cars|first=Rory|last=Cellan-Jones|date=12 June 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autonomous vs. automated ===
''Autonomous'' means self-governing.&lt;ref name="antsaklis1991introduction"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Antsaklis|first1=Panos J.|last2=Passino|first2=Kevin M.|last3=Wang|first3=S.J.|year=1991|title=An Introduction to Autonomous Control Systems|url=http://neuron-ai.tuke.sk/hudecm/PDF_PAPERS/Intro-Aut-Control.pdf|journal=IEEE Control Systems|volume=11|issue=4|pages=5–13|doi=10.1109/37.88585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been ''automated'' (made automatic) subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment, such as magnetic strips. Autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention.&lt;ref name="antsaklis1991introduction" /&gt;

One approach is to implement [[communication networks]] both in the immediate vicinity (for [[Collision avoidance system|collision avoidance]]) and farther away (for congestion management). Such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicle's autonomy, while still not requiring human intervention.

Wood et al. (2012) wrote, "This Article generally uses the term 'autonomous,' instead of the term 'automated.' " The term "autonomous" was chosen "because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use (and thus is more familiar to the general public). However, the latter term is arguably more accurate. 'Automated' connotes control or operation by a machine, while 'autonomous' connotes acting alone or independently. Most of the vehicle concepts (that we are currently aware of) have a person in the driver’s seat, utilize a communication connection to the Cloud or other vehicles, and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them. Thus, the term 'automated' would more accurately describe these vehicle concepts."&lt;ref name="Woodetal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=S. P.|last2=Chang|first2=J.|last3=Healy|first3=T.|last4=Wood|first4=J.|title=The potential regulatory challenges of increasingly autonomous motor vehicles.|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2734&amp;context=lawreview|journal=52nd Santa Clara Law Review|volume=4|issue=9|pages=1423–1502}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regime.

Put in the words of one Nissan engineer, "A truly autonomous car would be one where you request it to take you to work and it decides to go to the beach instead."&lt;ref name="Autotrader"&gt;{{cite |title=Automated vs. Autonomous Vehicles: Is There a Difference? |url=https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/automated-vs-autonomous-vehicles-there-difference-273139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EuroNCAP defines autonomous in "Autonomous Emergency Braking" as: "the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident." which implies the autonomous system is not the driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euroncap.com/en/vehicle-safety/the-rewards-explained/autonomous-emergency-braking/|title=Autonomous Emergency Braking – Euro NCAP|website=www.euroncap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomous versus cooperative===

To make a car travel without any driver embedded within the vehicle some system makers used a remote driver.

But according to SAE J3016, {{quote|Some driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self-sufficiently, but if they depend on communication and/or cooperation with outside entities, they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous.}}

===Self-driving car===

Techemergence says. {{quote|“Self-driving” is a rather vague term with a vague meaning|Techemergence&lt;ref name="techemergence"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techemergence.com/self-driving-car-timeline-themselves-top-11-automakers/|title=The Self-Driving Car Timeline – Predictions from the Top 11 Global Automakers|date=29 May 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

NHTSA definition is: {{quote|These self-driving vehicles ultimately will integrate onto U.S. roadways by progressing through six levels of driver assistance technology advancements in the coming years. This includes everything from no automation (where a fully engaged driver is required at all times), to full autonomy (where an automated vehicle operates independently, without a human driver).|NHTSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/automated-vehicles-safety|title=Automated Vehicles for Safety|first=|last=matthew.lynberg.ctr@dot.gov|date=7 September 2017|website=NHTSA}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

NHTSA definition is: {{quote|Let’s be clear: fully automated or “self-driving” vehicles aren’t arriving in showrooms tomorrow; they’re likely years, maybe even decades, away.

According to Techemergence {{quote|This means the vehicle can safely drive itself under specific conditions but the driver will need to quickly intervene when called on. This is a car that could drive itself on the highway while you watch a movie but would need you to take control when you get off the highway. Some may view this as only partially self-driving. |Techemergence,&lt;ref name="techemergence" /&gt; July 2018}}

According to Techemergence {{quote| it will be useful to understand that most executives referring to “self-driving” are referring to levels 3 and 4.|Techemergence,&lt;ref name="techemergence" /&gt; July 2018}}

=== Classification ===
[[File:Tesla Autopilot Engaged in Model X.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Tesla Autopilot system is considered to be an SAE level 2 system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bgr.com/2016/07/21/tesla-autopilot-crash-avoidance-report/ |title=Tesla Autopilot Crash Avoidance Model S Autopilot saves man’s life |first=Zach |last=Epstein |work=BGR |date=21 July 2016 |access-date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A classification system based on six different levels (ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems) was published in 2014 by [[SAE International]], an automotive standardization body, as J3016, ''Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|URL=https://www.adaptive-ip.eu/index.php/deliverables_papers.html?file=files/adaptive/content/downloads/Deliverables%20%26%20papers/AdaptIVe-SP2-v12-DL-D2.1%20System%20Classification.pdf|title=AdaptIVe system classification and glossary on Automated driving|access-date=11 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007124740/https://www.adaptive-ip.eu/index.php/deliverables_papers.html?file=files%2Fadaptive%2Fcontent%2Fdownloads%2FDeliverables%20%26%20papers%2FAdaptIVe-SP2-v12-DL-D2.1%20System%20Classification.pdf|archive-date=7 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf|title=AUTOMATED DRIVING LEVELS OF DRIVING AUTOMATION ARE DEFINED IN NEW SAE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD J3016|date= 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120142825/http://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf|archivedate=20 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classification system is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required, rather than the vehicle capabilities, although these are very loosely related. In the United States in 2013, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) released a formal classification system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/U.S.+Department+of+Transportation+Releases+Policy+on+Automated+Vehicle+Development|title=U.S. Department of Transportation Releases Policy on Automated Vehicle Development|date=30 May 2013|work=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|access-date=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but abandoned this system in favor of the SAE standard in 2016. Also in 2016, SAE updated its classification, called J3016_201609.&lt;ref&gt;SAE International&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Levels of driving automation ====
In SAE's automation level definitions, "driving mode" means "a type of driving scenario with characteristic dynamic driving task requirements (e.g., expressway merging, high speed cruising, low speed traffic jam, closed-campus operations, etc.)"&lt;ref name="SAE_definitions"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903105244/https://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 September 2017|title=Wayback Machine|date=3 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Level 0: Automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control.
* Level 1 ("hands on"): The driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle. Examples are [[Adaptive Cruise Control]] (ACC), where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls speed; and [[Automatic Parking|Parking Assistance]], where steering is automated while speed is under manual control. The driver must be ready to retake full control at any time. [[Lane departure warning system|Lane Keeping Assistance]] (LKA) Type II is a further example of level 1 self-driving.
* Level 2 ("hands off"): The automated system takes full control of the vehicle (accelerating, braking, and [[lane centering|steering]]). The driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly. The shorthand "hands off" is not meant to be taken literally. In fact, contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during SAE 2 driving, to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene.
* Level 3 ("eyes off"): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response, like emergency braking. The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time, specified by the manufacturer, when called upon by the vehicle to do so. As an example, the 2018 Audi A8 Luxury Sedan was the first commercial car to claim to be capable of level 3 self-driving. This particular car has a so-called Traffic Jam Pilot. When activated by the human driver, the car takes full control of all aspects of driving in slow-moving traffic at up to {{convert|60|km/h}}. The function works only on highways with a physical barrier separating one stream of traffic from oncoming traffic.
* Level 4 ("mind off"): As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, e.g. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver's seat. Self-driving is supported only in limited spatial areas ([[Geo-fence|geofenced]]) or under special circumstances, like traffic jams. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, e.g. park the car, if the driver does not retake control.
* Level 5 ("steering wheel optional"): No human intervention is required at all. An example would be a robotic taxi.

In the formal SAE definition below, note in particular what happens in the shift from SAE 2 to SAE 3: the human driver no longer has to monitor the environment. This is the final aspect of the "dynamic driving task" that is now passed over from the human to the automated system. At SAE 3, the human driver still has the responsibility to intervene when asked to do so by the automated system. At SAE 4 the human driver is relieved of that responsibility and at SAE 5 the automated system will never need to ask for an intervention.

==Legal definition==
In the District of Columbia (DC) code, {{quote|“Autonomous vehicle” means a vehicle capable of navigating District roadways and interpreting traffic-control devices without a driver actively operating any of the vehicle’s control systems. The term “autonomous vehicle” excludes a motor vehicle enabled with active safety systems or driver- assistance systems, including systems to provide electronic blind-spot assistance, crash avoidance, emergency braking, parking assistance, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assistance, lane-departure warning, or traffic-jam and queuing assistance, unless the system alone or in combination with other systems enables the vehicle on which the technology is installed to drive without active control or monitoring by a human operator.}}

In the same district code, it is considered that:

{{quote|An autonomous vehicle may operate on a public roadway; provided, that the vehicle:
* (1) Has a manual override feature that allows a driver to assume control of the autonomous vehicle at any time;
* (2) Has a driver seated in the control seat of the vehicle while in operation who is prepared to take control of the autonomous vehicle at any moment; and
* (3) Is capable of operating in compliance with the District’s applicable traffic laws and motor vehicle laws and traffic control devices.}}

== Semi-automated vehicles ==
Between manually driven vehicles (SAE Level 0) and fully autonomous vehicles (SAE Level 5), there are a variety of vehicle types that can be described to have some degree of [[Vehicular automation|automation]]. These are collectively known as semi-automated vehicles. As it could be a while before the technology and infrastructure is developed for full automation, it is likely that vehicles will have increasing levels of automation. These semi-automated vehicles could potentially harness many of the advantages of fully automated vehicles, while still keeping the driver in charge of the vehicle.

== Technical challenges==

The challenge for driverless car designers is to produce control systems capable of analyzing sensory data in order to provide accurate detection of other vehicles and the road ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Wentao|last2=Miao|first2=Jun|last3=Hu|first3=Jiangbi|last4=Qing|first4=Laiyun|date=27 March 2014|title=Vehicle detection in driving simulation using extreme learning machine|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231213010126|journal=Neurocomputing|volume=128|pages=160–165|doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2013.05.052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern self-driving cars generally use [[Bayes' theorem|Bayesian]] [[simultaneous localization and mapping]] (SLAM) algorithms,&lt;ref name="IEEE1"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal= IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Magazine |title=Simultaneous localization and mapping | volume= 13|issue= 2 |pages= 99–110 |date=5 June 2006 |issn=1070-9932 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1638022/ |doi=10.1109/mra.2006.1638022 | last1 = Durrant-Whyte | first1 = H. | last2 = Bailey | first2 = T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which fuse data from multiple sensors and an off-line map into current location estimates and map updates. Waymo has developed a variant of SLAM with detection and tracking of other moving objects (DATMO), which also handles obstacles such as cars and pedestrians.

== Nature of the digital technology ==
Autonomous vehicles, as a digital technology, have certain characteristics that distinguishes them from other types of technologies and vehicles. Due to these characteristics, autonomous vehicles are able to be more transformative and agile to possible changes. The characteristics will be explained based on the following subjects: homogenization and decoupling, connectivity, reprogrammable and smart, digital traces and modularity.

=== Homogenization and decoupling ===
Homogenization comes from the fact that all digital information assumes the same form. During the ongoing evolution of the digital era, certain industry standards have been developed on how to store digital information and in what type of format. This concept of homogenization also implies to autonomous vehicles. In order for autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings, they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information (e.g. radar, GPS, motion sensors and computer vision). Due to homogenization, the digital information from these different techniques is stored in a homogeneous way. This implies that all digital information comes in the same form, which means their differences are decoupled, and digital information can be transmitted, stored and computed in a way that the vehicles and its operating system can better understand and act upon it. Homogenization also helps to exponentially increase the computing power of hard- and software (Moore's law) which also supports the autonomous vehicles to understand and act upon the digital information in a more cost-effective way, therefore lowering the  marginal costs.;

=== Connectivity ===
Connectivity means that users of a certain digital technology can connect easily with other users, other applications or even (other) enterprises. In the case of autonomous vehicles, it is essential for them to connect with other ‘devices’ in order to function most effectively. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with communication systems which allow them to communicate with other autonomous vehicles and roadside units to provide them, amongst other things, with information about road work or traffic congestion. In addition, scientists believe that the future will have computer programs that connects and manages each individual autonomous vehicle as it navigates through an intersection. This type of connectivity must replace traffic lights and stop signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Reuters|first=Thomson|title=No lights, no signs, no accidents - future intersections for...|url=https://www.reuters.com/video/2012/03/22/no-lights-no-signs-no-accidents-future-i?videoId=232193655&amp;videoChannel=6|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of characteristics drive and further develop the ability of autonomous vehicles to understand and cooperate with other products and services (such as intersection computer systems) in the autonomous vehicles market. This could lead to a network of autonomous vehicles all using the same network and information available on that network. Eventually, this can lead to more autonomous vehicles using the network because the information has been validated through usage of other autonomous vehicles. Such movements will strengthen the value of the network and is called network externalities.;

=== Reprogrammable and smart ===
Another characteristic of autonomous vehicles is that the core product will have a greater emphasis on the software and its possibilities, instead of the chassis and its engine. This is because autonomous vehicles have software systems that drive the vehicle meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner (e.g. update in better distinguishing blind person vs. non-blind person so that the vehicle will take extra caution when approaching a blind person). A characteristic of this reprogrammable part of autonomous vehicles is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier, cause through machine learning (smart) autonomous vehicles can generate certain updates and install them accordingly (e.g. new navigation maps or new intersection computer systems). These reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of autonomous vehicles the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software. This also implies that autonomous vehicles are never finished because the product can be continuously be improved.;

=== Digital traces ===
Autonomous vehicles are equipped with different sorts of sensors and radars. As said, this allows them to connect and interoperate with computers from other autonomous vehicles and/or roadside units. This implies that autonomous vehicles leave digital traces when they connect or interoperate. The data that comes from these digital traces can be used to develop new (to be determined) products or updates to enhance autonomous vehicles’ driving ability or safety.

=== Modularity ===
Traditional vehicles and their accompanying (traditional) technologies are manufactured as a product that will be complete, and unlike autonomous vehicles, they can only be improved if they are redesigned or reproduced. As said, autonomous vehicles are produced but due to their digital characteristics never finished. This is because autonomous vehicles are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a Layered Modular Architecture. The Layered Modular Architecture extends the architecture of purely physical vehicles by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services and contents into Autonomous Vehicles. These loosely coupled layers can interact through certain standardized interfaces.

* (1) The first layer of this architecture consists of the device layer. This layer consists of the following two parts: logical capability and physical machinery. The physical machinery refers to the actual vehicle itself (e.g. chassis and carrosserie). When it comes to digital technologies, the physical machinery is accompanied by a logical capability layer in the form of operating systems that helps to guide the vehicles itself and make it autonomous. The logical capability provides the control over the vehicle and connects it with the other layers.;
* (2) On top of the device layer comes the network layer. This layer also consists of two different parts: physical transport and logical transmission. The physical transport layer refers to the radars, sensors and cables of the autonomous vehicles which enable the transmission of digital information. Next to that, the network layer of autonomous vehicles also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms or between layers. This increases the accessibility of the autonomous vehicles and enables computational power of a network or platform.;
* (3) The service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the autonomous vehicle (and its owners) as they extract, create, store and consume content with regards to their own driving history, traffic congestion, roads or parking abilities for example.; and
* (4) The final layer of the model is the contents layer. This layer contains the sounds, images and videos the autonomous vehicles store, extract and use to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment. The contents layer also provides metadata and directory information about the content's origin, ownership, copyright, encoding methods, content tags, geo-time stamps, and so on (Yoo et al., 2010).
The consequence of layered modular architecture of autonomous vehicles (and other digital technologies) is that it enables the emergence and development of platforms and ecosystems around a product and/or certain modules of that product. Traditionally, automotive vehicles were developed, manufactured and maintained by traditional manufacturers. Nowadays app developers and content creators can help to develop a more comprehensive product experience for the consumers which creates a platform around the product of autonomous vehicles.}}

== Human factor challenges ==
Alongside the many technical challenges that autonomous cars face, there exist many human and social factors that may impede upon the wider uptake of the technology. As things become more automated, the human users need to have trust in the automation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Trust in Automation – Before and After the Experience of Take-over Scenarios in a Highly Automated Vehicle|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978915008483|journal=Procedia Manufacturing|language=en|volume=3|pages=3025–3032|doi=10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.847|issn=2351-9789}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be a challenge in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2017/08/survey-data-suggests-self-driving-cars-could-be-slow-to-gain-consumer-trust/|title=Survey Data Suggests Self-Driving Cars Could Be Slow To Gain Consumer Trust|work=GM Authority|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Weather may also affect the car sensors, which may affect the auto driving mode. When heavy rainfall, heavy storms, heavy snowfall affect or damage the car sensors. Because of this, the performance of the car decreases gradually and the chance of accidents increases.

== Testing ==
Testing vehicles with varying degrees of automation can be done physically, in closed environments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtc.umich.edu/|title=Mcity testing center|date=8 December 2016|work=University of Michigan|access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; on public roads (where permitted, typically with a license or permit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/testing|title=Adopted Regulations for Testing of Autonomous Vehicles by Manufacturers|date=18 June 2016|work=DMV|access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or adhering to a specific set of operating principles)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/automated-vehicle-technologies-testing-code-of-practice|title=The Pathway to Driverless Cars: A Code of Practice for testing|date=19 July 2015|access-date=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or virtually, i.e. in computer simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/index|title=Automobile simulation example|date=18 June 2018|work=Cyberbotics|access-date=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When driven on public roads, automated vehicles require a person to monitor their proper operation and "take over" when needed. For example, New York State has strict requirements for the test driver so that at all times the vehicle can be corrected by a licensed driver; highlighted by Cardian Cube Company's application and discussions with New York State officials and the NYS DMV.&lt;ref&gt;https://dmv.ny.gov/dmv/apply-autonomous-vehicle-technology-demonstration-testing-permit&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple is currently testing self-driven cars, and has increased the number of test vehicles from 3 to 27 in January 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krok|first1=Andrew|title=Apple increases self-driving test fleet from 3 to 27|url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/apple-increases-self-driving-test-fleet-from-3-to-27/|website=Roadshow|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to 45 in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Zac|title=Apple ramping self-driving car testing, more CA permits than Tesla and Uber|url=https://electrek.co/2018/03/20/apple-autonomous-car-testing-progress/|website= [[Electrek]] |access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way to assess the progress of automated vehicles is to compute the average distance driven between "disengagements", when the automated system is turned off, typically by a human driver. In 2017, Waymo reported 63 disengagements over {{convert|352545|mi}} of testing, or {{convert|5596|mi}} on average, the highest among companies reporting such figures. Waymo also traveled more distance in total than any other. Their 2017 rate of 0.18 disengagements per {{convert|1000|mi}} was an improvement from 0.2 disengagements per {{convert|1000|mi}} in 2016 and 0.8 in 2015. In March, 2017, Uber reported an average of {{convert|0.67|mi}} per disengagement. In the final three months of 2017, [[Cruise Automation]] (now owned by [[General Motors|GM]]) averaged {{convert|5224|mi}} per disruption over {{convert|62689|mi}}.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/03/uber-self-driving-system-was-still-400-times-worse-waymo-in-2018-on-key-distance-intervention-metric.html|title=Uber' self-driving system was still 400 times worse [than] Waymo in 2018 on key distance intervention metric|last=Wang|first=Brian|date=25 March 2018|work=NextBigFuture.com|access-date=25 March 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, the first electric driverless racing car "Robocar" completed 1.8 kilometers track, using its navigation system and artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.euronews.com/2018/07/16/first-self-driving-race-car-completes-1-8-kilometre-track|title=First self-driving race car completes 1.8 kilometre track|date=2018-07-16|work=euronews|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport systems ===
In Europe, cities in Belgium, France, Italy and the UK are planning to operate transport systems for automated cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/result/brief/rcn/10263_en.html|title=Driverless cars take to the road|publisher=E.U.CORDIS Research Program CitynetMobil|access-date=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Detroit News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131227/POLITICS02/312270067/1148/rss25|title=Snyder OKs self-driving vehicles on Michigan's roads|date=27 December 2013|publisher=Detroit News|access-date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28551069|title=BBC News – UK to allow driverless cars on public roads in January|work=BBC News|access-date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain have allowed public testing in traffic.

In China, [[Baidu]] and [[King Long]] produce automated minibus, a vehicle with 14 seats, but without driving seat. With 100 vehicles produced, 2018 will be the first year with commercial automated service in China. Those minibuses should be at level 4, that is driverless in closed roads.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Potential advantages ==

=== Safety ===
Driving safety experts predict that once driverless technology has been fully developed, [[traffic collision]]s (and [[Epidemiology of motor vehicle collisions|resulting deaths and injuries]] and costs), caused by [[human error]], such as delayed [[Stopping sight distance|reaction time]], [[Tail gating|tailgating]], [[rubbernecking]], and other forms of [[Distracted driving|distracted]] or [[aggressive driving]] should be substantially reduced.&lt;ref name="morgan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="theenergycollective.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitwam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/business/economy/29view.html|title=Can I See Your License, Registration and C.P.U.?|last=Cowen|first=Tyler|date=28 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consulting firm [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] estimated that widespread use of autonomous vehicles could "eliminate 90% of all auto accidents in the United States, prevent up to {{USD|190 billion}} in damages and health-costs annually and save thousands of lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/self-driving-cars-could-cut-down-on-accidents-study-says-1425567905|title=Self-Driving Cars Could Cut Down on Accidents, Study Says|last=Ramsey|first=Mike|date=3 May 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to motorist website "TheDrive.com" operated by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, none of the driving safety experts they were able to contact were able to rank driving under an autopilot system at the time (2017) as having achieved a greater level of safety than traditional fully hands-on driving, so the degree to which these benefits asserted by proponents will manifest in practice cannot be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrive.com/opinion/7324/the-way-we-talk-about-autonomy-is-a-lie-and-thats-dangerous|title=The Way We Talk About Autonomy Is a Lie, and That's Dangerous|first=Jonathon|last=Ramsey|website=www.thedrive.com|date=8 March 2017|access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confounding factors that could reduce the net effect on safety may include unexpected interactions between humans and partly or fully automated vehicles, or between different types of vehicle system; complications at the boundaries of functionality at each automation level (such as handover when the vehicle reaches the limit of its capacity); the effect of the bugs and flaws that inevitably occur in complex interdependent software systems; sensor or data shortcomings; and successful compromise by malicious interveners.

One study estimated that automated cars could increase capacity by 273% (~8,200 cars per hour per lane). The study also estimated that with 100% connected vehicles using vehicle-to-vehicle communication, capacity could reach 12,000 passenger vehicles per hour (up 445% from 2,200&amp;nbsp;pc/h per lane) traveling safely at {{Convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}} with a following gap of about {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} of each other. Currently, at highway speeds drivers keep between {{convert|40|to|50|m|abbr=on|ft}} away from the car in front.

=== Parking space ===
Manually driven vehicles are reported to be used only 4–5% time, and being parked and unused for the remaining 95–96% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racfoundation.org/research/mobility/spaced-out-perspectives-on-parking|title=Spaced Out parking report|website=www.racfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reinventingparking.org/2013/02/cars-are-parked-95-of-time-lets-check.html|title="Cars are parked 95% of the time".

Assuming the increased efficiency is not fully offset by increases in demand, more efficient traffic flow could free roadway space for other uses such as better support for pedestrians and cyclists.

The vehicles' increased awareness could aid the police by reporting on illegal passenger behavior, while possibly enabling other crimes, such as deliberately crashing into another vehicle or a pedestrian.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; However, this may also lead to much expanded mass surveillance if there is wide access granted to third parties to the large data sets generated.

The sort of hoped-for potential benefits from increased vehicle automation described  may be limited by foreseeable challenges, such as disputes over liability (will each company operating  a vehicle accept that they are its "driver" and thus responsible for what their car does, or will some try to project this liability onto others who are not in control?),&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; the time needed to turn over the existing stock of vehicles from non-automated to automated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/nhtsa-chief-takes-conservative-view-on-autonomous-vehicles/|title=NHTSA chief takes conservative view on autonomous vehicles: "If you had perfect, connected autonomous vehicles on the road tomorrow, it would still take 20 to 30 years to turn over the fleet."|last=Nichols|first=Greg|date=13 February 2016|work=ZDNet|access-date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus a long period of humans and autonomous vehicles sharing the roads, resistance by individuals to having to forfeit control of their cars,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; concerns about the safety of driverless in practice,&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; and the implementation of a legal framework and consistent global government regulations for self-driving cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2013/09/24/will-regulators-allow-self-driving-cars-in-a-few-years/|title=Will Regulators Allow Self-Driving Cars In A Few Years?|date=24 September 2013|work=Forbes|access-date=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other obstacles could include de-skilling and lower levels of driver experience for dealing with potentially dangerous situations and anomalies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/18/5120270/reliance-on-autopilot-is-now-the-biggest-threat-to-flight-safety|title=Reliance on autopilot is now the biggest threat to flight safety, study says|date=18 November 2013|access-date=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ethical problems where an automated vehicle's software is forced during an unavoidable crash to choose between multiple harmful courses of action ('the [[trolley problem]]'),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/the-ethics-of-autonomous-cars/280360/|title=The Ethics of Autonomous Cars|author=Patrick Lin|date=8 October 2013|publisher=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/06/18/when-should-your-driverless-car-from-google-be-allowed-to-kill-you/|title=When Should Your Driverless Car From Google Be Allowed To Kill You?|author=Tim Worstall|date=18 June 2014|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00426/full|title=Forced-choice decision-making in modified trolley dilemma situations: a virtual reality and eye tracking study|author1=Alexander Skulmowski|author2=Andreas Bunge|date=16 December 2014|publisher=Front.

The lack of stressful driving, more productive time during the trip, and the potential savings in travel time and cost could become an incentive to live far away from cities, where land is cheaper, and work in the city's core, thus increasing travel distances and inducing more [[urban sprawl]], more fuel consumption and an increase in the [[carbon footprint]] of urban travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/comment-and-analysis/the-downside-of-driverless-cars-20151105-gkro8y.html|title=The downside of driverless cars|last=Smith|first=Noah|date=5 November 2015|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sprawl"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/10/tesla-self-driving-car-sprawl/|title=Whoops: The Self-Driving Tesla May Make Us Love Urban Sprawl Again|last=Ufberg|first=Max|date=15 October 2015|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the risk that traffic congestion might increase, rather than decrease.&lt;ref name="RAND" /&gt; Appropriate public policies and regulations, such as zoning, pricing, and urban design are required to avoid the negative impacts of increased suburbanization and longer distance travel.&lt;ref name="RAND" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sprawl" /&gt;

Hamish Jamson. "[http://drivingassessment.uiowa.edu/DA2009/072_MeratJamson.pdf HOW DO DRIVERS BEHAVE IN A HIGHLY AUTOMATED CAR?] " Institute for Transport Studies University of Leeds. Quote: "Drivers' response to all critical events was found to be much later in the automated driving condition, compared to manual driving."&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the capabilities of automated vehicles and the frequency with which human intervention is needed, this may counteract any increase in safety, as compared to all-human driving, that may be delivered by other factors.

Ethical and moral reasoning come into consideration when programming the software that decides what action the car takes in an unavoidable crash; whether the automated car will crash into a bus, potentially killing people inside; or swerve elsewhere, potentially killing its own passengers or nearby pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Self-driving cars programmed to decide who dies in a crash|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2017/11/23/self-driving-cars-programmed-decide-who-dies-crash/891493001/|website=USA Today|publisher=Detroit Free Press|access-date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A question that programmers of AI systems find difficult to answer (as do ordinary people, and ethicists) is "what decision should the car make that causes the ‘smallest’ damage to people's lives?" One proposed solution is the implementation of ethics bots in self-driving vehicles, which learn from user preferences to ultimately guide autonomous instruments in accordance with the owner's values and preferences. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Etzioni|first1=Amitai|last2=Etzioni|first2=Oren|title=Incorporating Ethics into Artificial Intelligence|journal=The Journal of Ethics|date=December 2017|volume=21|issue=4|page=403–418|doi=10.1007/s10892-017-9252-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics of automated vehicles are still being articulated, and may lead to controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodall|first1=Noah|title=Can you program ethics into a self-driving car?|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=June 2016|pages=25–28|doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2016.7473149|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7473149|access-date=29 November 2017|volume=53|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also require closer consideration of the variability, context-dependency, complexity and non-deterministic nature of human ethics. Different human drivers make various ethical decisions when driving, such as avoiding harm to themselves, or putting themselves at risk to protect others. These decisions range from rare extremes such as self-sacrifice or criminal negligence, to routine decisions good enough to keep the traffic flowing but bad enough to cause accidents, road rage and stress.

Human thought and reaction time may sometimes be too slow to detect the risk of an upcoming fatal crash, think through the ethical implications of the available options, or take an action to implement an ethical choice. Whether a particular automated vehicle's capacity to correctly detect an upcoming risk, analyse the options or choose a 'good' option from among bad choices would be as good or better than a particular human's may be difficult to predict or assess. This difficulty may be in part because the level of automated vehicle system understanding of the ethical issues at play in a given road scenario, sensed for an instant from out of a continuous stream of synthetic physical predictions of the near future, and dependent on layers of pattern recognition and situational intelligence, may be opaque to human inspection because of its origins in probabilistic machine learning rather than a simple, plain English 'human values' logic of parsable rules. The depth of understanding, predictive power and ethical sophistication needed will be hard to implement, and even harder to test or assess.

The scale of this challenge may have other effects. There may be few entities able to marshal the resources and AI capacity necessary to meet it, as well as the capital necessary to take an automated vehicle system to market and sustain it operationally for the life of a vehicle, and the legal and 'government affairs' capacity to deal with the potential for liability for a significant proportion of traffic accidents. This may have the effect of narrowing the number of different system opertors, and eroding the presently quite diverse global vehicle market down to a small number of system suppliers.

== Potential changes for different industries ==
The traditional automobile is subject to changes that on the one hand are technology pushed, and on the other hand are demanded by the market. 
Where in the first case the technological discontinuity is fueled by the breakthrough technological innovation described, the second case is driven by the extent to which the market is used to adopting new technologies faster. 
In both cases the end of the era of incremental change was recognized, which is graphically displayed at the point where the transition is made to a new technology above. This point causes new entrants to the automotive industry to present themselves, which can be distinguished as mobility providers such as Uber and Lyft, as well as tech giants such as Google and nVidia. 
As new entrants to the industry will lead to a certain extent of uncertainty, due to the changing dynamics, the era of ferment will be the next phase in the Technology Life Cycle. With the entrance of tech giants, alliances between them and traditional car manufacturers are entered. This causes a variation in the innovation- and production process of autonomous vehicles. Besides that, the entrance of mobility providers has caused ambiguous user preferences. The increasing extent to which these providers are present in the industry is supported by the flattening curve on the ‘vehicles per capita’ graph. In addition, the rise of the sharing economy also contributes to this matter and allows forecasters to question whether private ownership of vehicles is still relevant when the dominant design is being selected.

=== Taxi industry ===
With the aforementioned ambiguous user preference regarding the private ownership of autonomous vehicles, it is possible that the current mobility provider trend will continue when the dominant design is selected. Established providers such as Uber and Lyft are already significantly present within the industry, and it is likely that new entrants will enter when business opportunities arise. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16841090/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-car-ces-2018|title=You can take a ride in a self-driving Lyft during CES|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare-, repair-, and insurance industry ===
With the increasing reliance of autonomous vehicles on interconnectivity and the availability of big data which is made usable in the form of real time maps, driving decisions can be made much faster in order to prevent collisions. Numbers made available by the US government state that 94% of the vehicle accidents is due to human failures. With that in mind, it is safe to say that there is a major implication for the healthcare industry. Numbers of the National Safety Council on killed and injured people on U.S. roads multiplied by the average costs of a single incident point out that an estimated 500-billion-dollar loss is accounted for the US healthcare industry only by the time autonomous vehicles are dominating the roads. On the positive side, these numbers will positively contribute to the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles, as well as the possibility to better allocate healthcare resources. As collisions are less likely to occur, and the risk for human errors is reduced significantly, the repair industry will face an enormous reduction of work that has to be done on the reparation of car frames. Meanwhile, as the generated data of the autonomous vehicle is likely to predict when certain replaceable parts are in need of maintenance, car owners and the repair industry will be able to preventively replace a part that will fail soon. This ‘Asset Efficiency Service’ would implicate a productivity gain for this business.
As fewer collisions implicate less money spend on repair costs, the role of the insurance industry is likely to be altered as well. It can be expected that the increased safety of transport due to autonomous vehicles will lead to a decrease in payouts for the insurers, which is positive for the industry, but on the other hand fewer payouts implicate a demand drop for insurances in general. The insurance industry has to come up with new insurance models in the near future.  An unexpected disadvantage would be a reduction in organs available for transplant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Adams |first1=Ian |title=Self-Driving Cars Will Make Organ Shortages Even Worse |url=https://slate.com/technology/2016/12/self-driving-cars-will-exacerbate-organ-shortages.html |accessdate=9 November 2018 |work=[[Slate (magazine)]] |date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rescue-, emergency- and military industry ===
The technique used in autonomous driving also ensures life savings in other industries. The implementation of autonomous vehicles within the rescue-, emergency- and military industry already leads to a decrease in death. Military personnel uses autonomous vehicles to reach dangerous and remote places on earth to deliver fuel, food and general supplies, and even rescue people. In addition, a future implication of adopting autonomous vehicles could lead to a reduction in deployed personnel, which will lead to a decrease in injuries, since the technological development allows AVs to become more and more autonomous. Also, another future implication is the reduction of emergency drivers when autonomous vehicles are deployed as fire trucks or ambulances. An advantage could be the use of real-time traffic information and other generated data to determine routes more efficiently than human drivers. The time savings can be invaluable in these situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2017/08/29/the-us-army-is-developing-autonomous-armored-vehicles/|title=The US Army is developing autonomous armored vehicles|last=Snow|first=Shawn|date=2017-08-29|work=Army Times|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interior design- and media-entertainment industry ===
For the interior design industry, there are exciting times ahead. The driver is decreasingly focused on the actual driving, this implies that the interior design- and media-entertainment industry has to reconsider what passengers of autonomous vehicles are doing when they are on the road. Vehicles need to be redesigned, and possibly even be prepared for multipurpose usage. In practice, it will show that travelers have more time for business and/or leisure. In both cases, this gives increasing opportunities for the media-entertainment industry to demand attention. Moreover, the advertisement business is able to provide location based ads without risking driver safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20160405203131/https://cardesignresearch.com/en/insights/2015/01/driverless-car-design-sleepwalking-into-the-future|title=Driver-less car design: Sleep-walking into the future?|date=2016-04-05|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommunication and energy industry ===
As autonomous vehicles are producing enormous amounts of data that need to be transferred and analyzed, the upcoming 5G cellular network will play a pivotal role in doing so. In addition, the earlier mentioned entertainment industry is also highly dependent on this network to be active in this market segment. This implies higher revenues for the telecommunication industry.
Since autonomous vehicles are solely going to rely on electricity to operate, the demand for lithium batteries increases. This causes a necessary increase in supply of these type of batteries for the chemical industry. On the other hand, with the expected increase of battery powered (autonomous) vehicles, the petroleum industry is expected to undergo a decline in demand. As this implication  depends on the adoption rate of autonomous vehicles, it is unsure to what extent this implication will disrupt this particular industry. This transition phase of oil to electricity allows companies to explore whether there are business opportunities for them in the new energy ecosystem.

=== Restaurant, hotel and airline industry ===
Driver interactions with the vehicle will be less common within the near future, and in the more distant future the responsibility will lie entirely with the vehicle. As indicated above, this will have implications for the entertainment- and interior design industry. For roadside restaurants, the implication will be that the need for customers to stop driving and enter the restaurant will vanish, and the autonomous vehicle will have a double function. Moreover, accompanied with the rise of disruptive platforms such as Airbnb that have shaken up the hotel industry, the fast increase of developments within the autonomous vehicle industry might cause another implication for their customer bases. In the more distant future, the implication for motels might be that a decrease in guests will occur, since autonomous vehicles could be redesigned as fully equipped bedrooms. The improvements regarding the interior of the vehicles might additionally have implications for the airline industry. In the case of relatively short-haul flights, waiting times at customs or the gate imply lost time and hassle for customers. With the improved convenience in future car travel, it is possible that customers might go for this option, causing a loss in customer bases for airline industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://interestingengineering.com/volvos-fully-autonomous-360c-concept-vehicle-even-lets-you-sleep-in-it|title=Volvo’s Fully Autonomous 360c Concept Vehicle Even Lets You Sleep In It|date=2018-09-06|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elder, disabled and childcare industry ===
Autonomous vehicles will have a severe impact on the mobility options of persons that are not able to drive a vehicle themselves. To remain socially engaged with society or even able to do groceries, the elderly people of today are depending on caretakers to drive them to these places. In addition to the perceived freedom of the elderly people of the future, the demand for human aides will decrease. When we also consider the increased health of the elderly, it is safe to state that care centers will experience a decrease in the number of clients. Not only elderly people face difficulties of their decreased physical abilities, also disabled people will perceive the benefits of autonomous vehicles in the near future, causing their dependency on caretakers to decrease. Both industries are largely depending on informal caregivers, who are mostly relatives of the persons in need. Since there is less of a reliance on their time, employers of informal caregivers or even governments will experience a decrease of costs allocated to this matter. Children and teens, who are not able to drive a vehicle themselves, are also benefiting of the introduction of autonomous cars. Daycares and schools are able to come up with automated pick up and drop off systems, causing a decrease of reliance on parents and childcare workers. The extent to which human actions are necessary for driving will vanish. Since current vehicles require human actions to some extent, the driving school industry will not be disrupted until the majority of autonomous transportation is switched to the emerged dominant design. It is plausible that in the distant future driving a vehicle will be considered as a luxury, which implies that the structure of the industry is based on new entrants and a new market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jalopnik.com/why-autonomous-cars-could-be-the-change-disabled-people-1688864804|title=Why Autonomous Cars Could Be The Change Disabled People Need|last=McParland|first=Tom|work=Jalopnik|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Mercedes refined the system (from this point called "Distronic Plus") with the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W221)]] being the first car to receive the upgraded Distronic Plus system. Distronic Plus could now completely halt the car if necessary on E-Class and most Mercedes sedans. In an episode of ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'', [[Jeremy Clarkson]] demonstrated the effectiveness of the cruise control system in the S-class by coming to a complete halt from motorway speeds to a round-about and getting out, without touching the pedals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Clarkson, Jeremy|title=Radar Guided Cruise Control|date=4 July 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU83G3OaJuU|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017, Mercedes has vastly expanded its automated driving features on production cars: In addition to the standard Distronic Plus features such as an active brake assist, Mercedes now includes a steering pilot, a parking pilot, a cross-traffic assist system, night-vision cameras with automated danger warnings and braking assist (in case animals or pedestrians are on the road for example), and various other automated -driving features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/|title=Welcome to the Mercedes-Benz international website|work=Mercedes-Benz|date=|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/290478/mercedes-benz-e400-distronic-plus-with-steering-assist-demonstrated/|title=Mercedes-Benz E400: Distronic Plus with Steering Assist demonstrated|last=Ward|first=James|date=16 June 2014|website=www.caradvice.com.au|access-date=11 July 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.daimler.com/2015/03/18/einfach-technik-so-funktioniert-distronic-plus/|title=Daimler-Blog – Einfach Technik: So funktioniert DISTRONIC PLUS|last=Mercedes Blog-Team|first=|date=18 March 2015|website=Daimler-Blog|language=de|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbscottsdale.com/blog/how-to-use-distronic-plus-cruise-control-in-2016-mercedes-benz/|title=How to Use DISTRONIC PLUS Cruise Control in 2016 Mercedes-Benz|last=blogsadmin|first=|date=28 September 2015|website=www.mbscottsdale.com|language=en|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.loebermotors.com/blog/how-to-use-mercedes-benz-distronic-plus/|title=How To Use Mercedes-Benz DISTRONIC PLUS|last=blogsadmin|first=|date=28 February 2016|website=www.loebermotors.com|language=en|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Mercedes also introduced its Active Brake Assist 4, which was the first emergency braking assistant with pedestrian recognition on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/ko/en/12367326|title=Mercedes-Benz Trucks: Safety: New assistance systems: Active Brake Assist 4 emergency: braking assistant featuring pedestrian recognition and: Sideguard Assist|last=Daimler AG|first=|date=2016|website=media.daimler.com|language=en-EN|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Mercedes' history of gradually implementing advancements of their automated driving features that have been extensively tested, not many crashes that have been caused by it are known. One of the known crashes dates back to 2005, when German [[news magazine]] "''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]''" was testing Mercedes' old Distronic system. During the test, the system did not always manage to brake in time.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stern.de/tv/stern-tv---rtl-mercedes-s-klasse--panne-bei-crash-test-3290156.html|title=Mercedes S-Klasse: Panne bei Crash-Test|last=|first=|date=16 November 2005|work=Stern|access-date=11 July 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ulrich Mellinghoff, then Head of Safety, NVH, and Testing at the Mercedes-Benz Technology Centre, stated that some of the tests failed due to the vehicle being tested in a metallic hall, which caused problems with the system's radar.

On 20 January 2016, the first known fatal crash of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred in China's Hubei province. According to China's 163.com news channel, this marked "China's first accidental death due to Tesla's automatic driving (system)." Initially, Tesla pointed out that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to conclusively prove that the car had been on Autopilot at the time; however, 163.com pointed out that other factors, such as the car's absolute failure to take any evasive actions prior to the high speed crash, and the driver's otherwise good driving record, seemed to indicate a strong likelihood that the car was on Autopilot at the time. A similar fatal crash occurred four months later in Florida.&lt;ref name="china-fatality"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/783009/the-scary-similarities-between-teslas-tsla-deadly-autopilot-crashes|title=There are some scary similarities between Tesla's deadly crashes linked to Autopilot|publisher=Quartz|first1=Josh|last1=Horwitz|first2=Heather|last2=Timmons|date=20 September 2016|access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c.m.163.com/news/a/C0UBU2I0002580S6.html|title=China's first accidental death due to Tesla's automatic driving: not hitting the front bumper|language=Chinese|work=[[Media of China|China State Media]]|date=14 September 2016|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, in a subsequent civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla, Tesla did not deny that the car had been on Autopilot at the time of the accident, and sent evidence to the victim's father documenting that fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jalopnik.com/two-years-on-a-father-is-still-fighting-tesla-over-aut-1823189786|title=Two Years On, A Father Is Still Fighting Tesla Over Autopilot And His Son's Fatal Crash|first=Ryan|last=Felton|website=jalopnik.com|date=27 February 2018|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself took place in [[Williston, Florida]] on 7 May 2016 while a Tesla Model S [[electric car]] was engaged in Autopilot mode. The occupant was killed in a crash with an 18-wheel [[tractor-trailer]]. On 28 June 2016 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the [[Florida Highway Patrol]]. According to the NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The car continued to travel after passing under the truck's trailer.&lt;ref name="AutopilotCrash01"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk|title=Tesla driver dies in first fatal crash while using autopilot mode|last1=Yadron|first1=Danny|date=1 July 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=1 July 2016|last2=Tynan|first2=Dan|location=[[San Francisco]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutopilotCrash02"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/business/self-driving-tesla-fatal-crash-investigation.html|title=Self-Driving Tesla Involved in Fatal Crash|last1=Vlasic|first1=Bill|date=30 June 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=1 July 2016|last2=Boudette|first2=Neal E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NHTSA's preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash, which involved a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM530776/INOA-PE16007-7080.PDF|title=ODI Resume – Investigation: PE 16-007|author=Office of Defects Investigations, NHTSA|date=28 June 2016|publisher=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA)|access-date=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 July 2016, the NHTSA requested Tesla Motors provide the agency detailed information about the design, operation and testing of its Autopilot technology.

According to Tesla, "neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied." The car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer, "with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S." Tesla also claimed that this was Tesla's first known autopilot death in over {{convert|130|e6mi|e6km|abbr=off|sp=us}} driven by its customers with Autopilot engaged, however by this statement, Tesla was apparently refusing to acknowledge claims that the January 2016 fatality in Hubei China had also been the result of an autopilot system error. According to Tesla there is a fatality every {{convert|94|e6mi|e6km|abbr=off|sp=us}} among all type of vehicles in the U.S.&lt;ref name="AutopilotCrash01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutopilotCrash02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=A Tragic Loss|date=30 June 2016|publisher=[[Tesla Motors]]|url=https://www.teslamotors.com/blog/tragic-loss|quote=This is the first known fatality in just over 130 million miles where Autopilot was activated.

In July 2016, the U.S. [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) opened a formal investigation into the fatal accident while the Autopilot was engaged. The NTSB is an investigative body that has the power to make only policy recommendations. An agency spokesman said "It's worth taking a look and seeing what we can learn from that event, so that as that automation is more widely introduced we can do it in the safest way possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20160708/OEM11/307089859/ntsb-to-scrutinize-driver-automation-with-probe-of-tesla-crash|title=NTSB to scrutinize driver automation with probe of Tesla crash|authors=Alan Levin and Jeff Plungis|date=8 July 2016|work=[[Automotive News]]|access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the NTSB released the report that concluded Tesla was not at fault; the investigation revealed that for Tesla cars, the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after Autopilot was installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14323990/tesla-autopilot-fatal-accident-nhtsa-investigation-ends|title=Fatal Tesla Autopilot accident investigation ends with no recall ordered|date=19 January 2016|access-date=19 January 2017|publisher=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tesla, starting 19 October 2016, all Tesla cars are built with hardware to allow full self-driving capability at the highest safety level (SAE Level 5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware|title=All Tesla Cars Being Produced Now Have Full Self-Driving Hardware|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardware includes eight surround cameras and twelve ultrasonic sensors, in addition to the forward-facing radar with enhanced processing capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/autopilot/?utm|title=Autopilot: Full Self-Driving Hardware on All Cars|publisher=Tesla Motors|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system will operate in "shadow mode" (processing without taking action) and send data back to Tesla to improve its abilities until the software is ready for deployment via over-the-air upgrades.&lt;ref name="geuss"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/10/tesla-says-all-its-cars-will-ship-with-hardware-for-level-5-autonomy/|title=Teslas will now be sold with enhanced hardware suite for full autonomy|last1=Guess|first1=Megan|date=20 October 2016|access-date=20 October 2016|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the required testing, Tesla hopes to enable full self-driving by the end of 2019 under certain conditions.

=== Waymo ===
[[File:Google_driverless_car_at_intersection.gk.jpg|thumb|Google's in-house [[Waymo|automated car]].]]
Waymo originated as a self-driving car project within [[Google]]. In August 2012, Google announced that their vehicles had completed over 300,000 automated-driving miles (500,000&amp;nbsp;km) accident-free, typically involving about a dozen cars on the road at any given time, and that they were starting to test with single drivers instead of in pairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googleblog.blogspot.hu/2012/08/the-self-driving-car-logs-more-miles-on.html Self-driving Car Logs More Miles], googleblog&lt;/ref&gt; In late-May 2014, Google revealed a new prototype that had no steering wheel, gas pedal, or brake pedal, and was fully automated .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqSDWoAhvLU&amp;list=PLcNF6Ihx2JoUoNKe4PxLqEcZMM0QW2yG-|title=A First Drive|date=27 May 2014|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016|03}}, Google had test-driven their fleet in automated mode a total of {{convert|1,500,000|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/lt//selfdrivingcar/files/reports/report-0316.pdf|title=Google Self-Driving Car Project, Monthly Report, March 2016|publisher=Google|access-date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Google Corporation announced that its technology would be spun off to a new company called Waymo, with both Google and Waymo becoming subsidiaries of a new parent company called [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waymo.com|title=Waymo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/12/google-self-driving-car-waymo|title=Meet the Blind Man Who Convinced Google Its Self-Driving Car Is Finally Ready|last=Davies|first=Alex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Google's accident reports as of early 2016, their test cars had been involved in 14 collisions, of which other drivers were at fault 13 times, although in 2016 the car's software caused a crash.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/02/29/for-the-first-time-googles-self-driving-car-takes-some-blame-for-a-crash/|title=For the first time, Google’s self-driving car takes some blame for a crash|date=29 February 2016|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Brin confirmed that 12 vehicles had suffered collisions as of that date. Eight involved rear-end collisions at a stop sign or traffic light, two in which the vehicle was side-swiped by another driver, one in which another driver rolled through a stop sign, and one where a Google employee was controlling the car manually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google-cars-20150603-story.html|title=Google founder defends accident records of self-driving cars|date=3 June 2015|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, three Google employees suffered minor injuries when their vehicle was rear-ended by a car whose driver failed to brake at a traffic light.

During the maneuver it struck a bus. Google stated, "In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved there wouldn't have been a collision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/02/googles-self-driving-car-may-caused-first-crash/|title=Google’s Self-Driving Car Caused Its First Crash|date=February 2016|publisher=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-google-self-driving-car-bus-collision-20160229-story.html|title=Passenger bus teaches Google robot car a lesson|date=29 February 2016|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience. No injuries were reported in the crash.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost" /&gt;

=== Uber ===
In March 2017, an Uber test vehicle was involved in a crash in [[Tempe, Arizona]] when another car failed to yield, flipping the Uber vehicle. There were no injuries in the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-25/uber-autonomous-vehicle-gets-in-accident-in-tempe-arizona|title=Uber to Suspend Autonomous Tests After Arizona Accident|date=25 March 2017|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 22 December 2017, Uber had completed {{convert|2|e6mi|e6km|abbr=off|sp=us}} in automated mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2017/12/22/ubers-self-driving-cars-2-million-miles/#8028baea4fe4|title=Uber's Self-Driving Cars Hit 2 Million Miles As Program Regains Momentum|date=22 December 2017|publisher=|via=www.forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2018, [[Death of Elaine Herzberg|Elaine Herzberg]] became the first pedestrian to be killed by a self-driving car in the United States after being hit by an Uber vehicle, also in Tempe. Herzberg was crossing outside of a [[Pedestrian crossing|crosswalk]], approximately 400 feet from an intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bensinger|first1=Greg|last2=Higgins|first2=Tim|title=Video Shows Moments Before Uber Robot Car Rammed Into Pedestrian|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/video-shows-final-seconds-before-fatal-uber-self-driving-car-crash-1521673182|access-date=25 March 2018|work=Wall Street Journal|date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes of the accidents include the following: nighttime, low visibility, pedestrian crossing from a shadowed portion of road, crossing a road that had high speed limit, and not checking for cars before crossing (blindly crossing street at night). This marks the first time an individual outside an auto-piloted car is known to have been killed by such a car. The first death of an essentially uninvolved third party is likely to raise new questions and concerns about the safety of automated cars in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/kzxq3y/self-driving-uber-killed-a-pedestrian-as-human-safety-driver-watched|title=Self-driving Uber killed a pedestrian as human safety driver watched|first=Alex|last=Lubben|publisher=[[Vice News]]|date=19 March 2018|access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts say a human driver could have avoided the fatal crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-22/video-said-to-show-failure-of-uber-s-tech-in-fatal-arizona-crash|title=Human Driver Could Have Avoided Fatal Uber Crash, Experts Say|date=22 March 2018|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona Governor [[Doug Ducey]] later suspended the company's ability to test and operate its automated cars on public roadways citing an "unquestionable failure" of the expectation that Uber make public safety its top priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=The Associated Press|author2=abc15.com staff|title=Governor Ducey suspends Uber from automated vehicle testing|url=https://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/governor-ducey-suspends-uber-from-autonomous-vehicle-testing|access-date=27 March 2018|work=[[KNXV-TV]]|date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uber has pulled out of all self-driving-car testing in California as a result of the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Uber-pulls-out-of-all-self-driving-car-testing-in-12785490.php | title=Uber puts the brakes on testing robot cars in California after Arizona fatality | first=Carolyn | last=Said | date=27 March 2018 | newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle | access-date=8 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May 2018 the National Transport Safety Board issued a preliminary report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HWY18MH010-prelim.pdf|title=Preliminary Report Released for Crash Involving Pedestrian, Uber Technologies, Inc., Test Vehicle|date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Navya automated bus driving system ===

On 9 November 2017, a [[Navya SAS|Navya]] automated self-driving bus with passengers was involved in a crash with a truck. The truck was found to be at fault of the crash, reversing into the stationary automated bus. The automated bus did not take evasive actions or apply [[defensive driving]] such as flash headlights, sound the horn, or as one passenger commented "The shuttle didn't have the ability to move back. The shuttle just stayed still."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/09/self-driving-bus-crashes-two-hours-after-las-vegas-launch-truck-autonomous-vehicle|title=Self-driving bus involved in crash less than two hours after Las Vegas launch|first=Samuel|last=Gibbs|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=9 November 2017|access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy implications ==

===Urban planning===
According to a [[Wonkblog]] reporter, if fully automated cars become commercially available, they have the potential to be a [[disruptive innovation]] with major implications for society. The likelihood of widespread adoption is still unclear, but if they are used on a wide scale, policy makers face a number of unresolved questions about their effects.&lt;ref name="badger" /&gt;

One fundamental question is about their effect on travel behavior. Some people believe that they will increase car ownership and car use because it will become easier to use them and they will ultimately be more useful.&lt;ref name="badger" /&gt; This may in turn encourage urban sprawl and ultimately total private vehicle use. Others argue that it will be easier to share cars and that this will thus discourage outright ownership and decrease total usage, and make cars more efficient forms of transportation in relation to the present situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5758560/driverless-cars-will-mean-the-end-of-car-ownership|title=Driverless cars will mean the end of mass car ownership|last1=Lee|first1=Timothy|date=31 January 2015|access-date=31 January 2015|publisher=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy-makers will have to take a new look at how infrastructure is to be built and how money will be allotted to build for automated vehicles. The need for traffic signals could potentially be reduced with the adoption of [[smart highway]]s.&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, Randal, Policy Implications of Autonomous Vehicles (18 September 2014). Cato Institute Policy Analysis No. 758. Available at SSRN: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ssrn.com/abstract=2549392&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Due to smart highways and with the assistance of smart technological advances implemented by policy change, the dependence on [[Oil dependence|oil imports]] may be reduced because of less time being spent on the road by individual cars which could have an effect on policy regarding energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinto | first1 = Cyrus | title = How autonomous vehicle policy in California and Nevada addresses technological and non-technological liabilities | url = | journal = Intersect: The Stanford Journal of Science, Technology and Society | volume = 5 | issue = | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, automated vehicles could increase the overall number of cars on the road which could lead to a greater dependence on oil imports if smart systems are not enough to curtail the impact of more vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/15/5-confounding-questions-that-hold-the-key-to-the-future-of-driverless-cars/|title=5 confounding questions that hold the key to the future of driverless cars|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=15 January 2015|work=Washington Post|access-date=27 November 2017|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the uncertainty of the future of automated vehicles, policy makers may want to plan effectively by implementing infrastructure improvements that can be beneficial to both human drivers and automated vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerra|first=Erick|date=1 June 2016|title=Planning for Cars That Drive Themselves: Metropolitan Planning Organizations, Regional Transportation Plans, and Autonomous Vehicles|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0739456X15613591|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=210–224|doi=10.1177/0739456X15613591|issn=0739-456X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caution needs to be taken in acknowledgment to [[Public Transportation|public transportation]] and that the use may be greatly reduced if automated vehicles are catered to through policy reform of infrastructure with this resulting in job loss and increased [[unemployment]].&lt;ref&gt;Litman, Todd. "Autonomous vehicle implementation predictions." ''Victoria Transport Policy Institute'' 28 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other disruptive effects will come from the use of automated vehicles to carry goods. Self-driving vans have the potential to make home deliveries significantly cheaper, transforming retail commerce and possibly making hypermarkets and supermarkets redundant. As of right now the U.S. Government defines automation into six levels, starting at level zero which means the human driver does everything and ending with level five, the automated system performs all the driving tasks. Also under the current law, manufacturers bear all the responsibility to self-certify vehicles for use on public roads. This means that currently as long as the vehicle is compliant within the regulatory framework, there are no specific federal legal barriers to a highly automated vehicle being offered for sale. [[Iyad Rahwan]], an associate professor in the MIT Media lab said, "Most people want to live in a world where cars will minimize casualties, but everyone wants their own car to protect them at all costs." Furthermore, industry standards and best practice are still needed in systems before they can be considered reasonably safe under real-world conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://transportandtravel.wordpress.com/2016/08/19/retail-revolution/|title=Retail Revolution|last=Humphreys|first=Pat|date=19 August 2016|work=Transport and Travel|access-date=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislation ===
The 1968 [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]], subscribed to by over 70 countries worldwide, establishes principles to govern traffic laws. One of the fundamental principles of the Convention has been the concept that a [[Driver (person)|driver]] is always fully in control and responsible for the behavior of a vehicle in traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalautoregs.com/rules/157-1968-vienna-convention-on-road-traffic|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201050545/https://globalautoregs.com/rules/157-1968-vienna-convention-on-road-traffic|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 December 2017|title=GAR – 1968 Vienna Convention|date=1 December 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The progress of technology that assists and takes over the functions of the driver is undermining this principle, implying that much of the groundwork must be rewritten.

====Legal status in the United States====
[[File:Self Driving Cars Legalized States in USA.png|thumb|U.S. states that allow testing of driverless cars on public roads]]
In the United States, a non-signatory country to the Vienna Convention, state vehicle codes generally do not envisage — but do not necessarily prohibit — highly automated vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/publications/automated-vehicles-are-probably-legal-united-states|title=Automated Vehicles Are Probably Legal in The United States|author=Bryant Walker Smith|date=1 November 2012|publisher=The Center for Internet and Society (CIS) at Stanford Law School|access-date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canis|first1=Bill|title=Issues in Autonomous Vehicle Deployment|date=19 September 2017|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44940.pdf|access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To clarify the legal status of and otherwise regulate such vehicles, several states have enacted or are considering specific laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Automated_Driving:_Legislative_and_Regulatory_Action|title=Automated Driving: Legislative and Regulatory Action|author=Bryant Walker Smith|date=|publisher=The Center for Internet and Society (CIS) at Stanford Law School|access-date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, 7 states (Nevada, California, Florida, Michigan, Hawaii, Washington, and Tennessee), along with the [[District of Columbia]], have enacted laws for automated vehicles. Incidents such as the first fatal accident by Tesla's Autopilot system have led to discussion about revising laws and standards for automated cars.

In September 2016, the US [[United States Department of Transportation|National Economic Council]] and [[Department of Transportation]] released federal standards that describe how automated vehicles should react if their technology fails, how to protect passenger privacy, and how riders should be protected in the event of an accident. The new federal guidelines are meant to avoid a patchwork of state laws, while avoiding being so overbearing as to stifle innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/technology/self-driving-cars-guidelines.html|title=Self-Driving Cars Gain Powerful Ally: The Government|last=Kang|first=Cecilia|date=19 September 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=28 September 2016|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the [[Nevada Legislature]] passed a law to authorize the use of automated cars. Nevada thus became the first jurisdiction in the world where automated vehicles might be legally operated on public roads. According to the law, the [[Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles]] (NDMV) is responsible for setting safety and performance standards and the agency is responsible for designating areas where automated cars may be tested.&lt;ref name="GCC0611"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/06/ab511-20110625.html|title=Nevada enacts law authorizing autonomous (driverless) vehicles|date=25 June 2011|publisher=Green Car Congress|access-date=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes0611"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/alexknapp/2011/06/22/nevada-passes-law-authorizing-driverless-cars/|title=Nevada Passes Law Authorizing Driverless Cars|author=Alex Knapp|date=22 June 2011|work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=25 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628165915/http://blogs.forbes.com/alexknapp/2011/06/22/nevada-passes-law-authorizing-driverless-cars/|archivedate=28 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/06/24/nevada-state-law-paves-the-way-for-driverless-cars/|title=Nevada state law paves the way for driverless cars|author=Christine Dobby|date=24 June 2011|work=[[Financial Post]]|access-date=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation was supported by [[Google]] in an effort to legally conduct further testing of its [[Google driverless car]].&lt;ref name="NYT0511"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/science/11drive.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1|title=Google Lobbies Nevada To Allow Self-Driving Cars|author=John Markoff|date=10 May 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nevada law defines an automated vehicle to be "a motor vehicle that uses [[artificial intelligence]], sensors and [[global positioning system]] coordinates to drive itself without the active intervention of a human operator." The law also acknowledges that the operator will not need to pay attention while the car is operating itself. Google had further lobbied for an exemption from a ban on distracted driving to permit occupants to send [[text message]]s while sitting behind the wheel, but this did not become law.&lt;ref name="NYT0511" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/76th2011/Bills/AB/AB511_EN.pdf|title=Bill AB511 Nevada Legislature|publisher=[[Nevada Legislature]]|access-date=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1062178_nevada-passes-law-allowing-self-driving-cars|title=Nevada Passes Law Allowing Self-Driving Cars|author=Tim Healey|date=24 June 2011|work=[[Motor Trend]]|access-date=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Nevada's regulations require a person behind the wheel and one in the passenger's seat during tests.&lt;ref name="LVS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/may/07/nevada-issues-google-first-license-self-driving-ca/|title=Nevada issues Google first license for self-driving car|author=Cy Ryan|date=7 May 2012|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|access-date=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 February 2016, [[Bill (law)|Assembly Bill]] No. 2866 was introduced in California that would allow automated vehicles to operate on the road, including those without a driver, steering wheel, accelerator pedal, or brake pedal. The Bill states the [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] would need to comply with these regulations by 1 July 2018 for these rules to take effect. This bill has yet to pass the house of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB2866|title=Bill Text – AB-2866 Autonomous vehicles.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation released its Federal Automated Vehicles Policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transportation.gov/AV|title=Federal Automated Vehicles Policy|work=Department of Transportation|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and California published discussions on the subject in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/b5ee940c-90e9-4f61-a48f-9be3a6e0e1bb/av_public_workshop_agenda_101916.pdf?MOD=AJPERES|title=Public Workshop Autonomous Vehicles|date=19 October 2016|access-date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, the [[California Department of Motor Vehicles]] ordered [[Uber]] to remove its self-driving vehicles from the road in response to two red-light violations.

====Legislation in Europe====

In 2013, the [[government of the United Kingdom]] permitted the testing of automated cars on public roads.&lt;ref name="UKTEST2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23330681|title=UK to road test driverless cars|date=16 July 2013|access-date=17 July 2013|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, all testing of robotic vehicles in the UK had been conducted on private property.&lt;ref name="UKTEST2013" /&gt;

In 2014, the [[Government of France]] announced that testing of automated cars on public roads would be allowed in 2015. 2000&amp;nbsp;km of road would be opened through the national territory, especially in Bordeaux, in Isère, Île-de-France and Strasbourg. At the 2015 ITS World Congress, a conference dedicated to intelligent transport systems, the very first demonstration of automated vehicles on open road in France was carried out in Bordeaux in early October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usine-digitale.fr/article/des-vehicules-autonomes-sur-route-ouverte-a-bordeaux-en-octobre-2015.N338350|title=Des véhicules autonomes sur route ouverte à Bordeaux en octobre 2015|work=usine-digitale.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a preemptive lawsuit against various automobile companies such as GM, Ford, and Toyota accused them of "Hawking vehicles that are vulnerable to hackers who could hypothetically wrest control of essential functions such as brakes and steering."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/advanced-cars/selfdriving-cars-will-be-ready-before-our-laws-are|title=Self-Driving Cars Will Be Ready Before Our Laws Are|last=Greenblatt|first=Nathan|date=|website=IEEE Spectrum|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring of 2015, the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications in Switzerland (UVEK) allowed [[Swisscom]] to test a driverless [[Volkswagen Passat]] on the streets of [[Zurich]].&lt;ref name="Swisstest2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/medien/press-releases/2015/05/20150512-MM-selbstfahrendes-Auto.html|title=Swisscom reeals the first driverless car on Swiss roads|date=12 May 2015|access-date=1 August 2015|publisher=Swisscom|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928062253/https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/medien/press-releases/2015/05/20150512-MM-selbstfahrendes-Auto.html|archivedate=28 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation in Asia====
In 2016, the Singapore Land Transit Authority in partnership with UK automotive supplier Delphi Automotive Plc will launch preparations for a test run of a fleet of [[automated taxi]]s for an on-demand automated cab service to take effect in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://investvine.com/singapore-launch-self-driving-taxis-next-year/|title=Singapore to launch self-driving taxis next year {{!}} Investvine|last=Maierbrugger|first=Arno|date=1 August 2016|language=en-US|access-date=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liability===
{{main|Self-driving car liability}}

Self-driving car liability is a developing area of law and policy that will determine who is liable when an automated car causes physical damage to persons, or breaks road rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Laws on Autonomous Vehicles|first=Sean|last=Slone|url=http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/kc/content/state-laws-autonomous-vehicles|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When automated cars shift the control of driving from humans to automated car technology, there may be a need for existing liability laws to evolve in order to fairly identify the parties responsible for damage and injury, and to address the potential for conflicts of interest between human occupants, system operator, insurers, and the public purse.&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt; Increases in the use of automated car technologies (e.g. [[advanced driver-assistance systems]]) may prompt incremental shifts in this responsibility for driving. It is claimed by proponents to have potential to affect the frequency of road accidents, although it is difficult to assess this claim in the absence of data from substantial actual use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ten ways autonomous driving could redefine the automotive world|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/ten-ways-autonomous-driving-could-redefine-the-automotive-world|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there was a dramatic improvement in safety, the operators may seek to project their liability for the remaining accidents onto others as part of their reward for the improvement.  However, there is no obvious reason why they should escape liability if any such effects were found to be modest or nonexistent, since part of the purpose of such liability is to give an incentive to the party controlling something to do whatever is necessary to avoid it causing harm. Potential users may be reluctant to trust an operator if it seeks to pass its normal liability on to others.

In any case, a well-advised person who is not controlling a car at all (Level 5) would be understandably reluctant to accept liability for something out of their control. And when there is some degree of sharing control possible (Level 3 or 4), a well-advised person would be concerned that the vehicle might try to pass back control at the last seconds before an accident, to pass responsibility and liability back too, but in circumstances where the potential driver has no better prospects of avoiding the crash than the vehicle, since they have not necessarily been paying close attention, and if it is too hard for the very smart car it might be too hard for a human. Since operators, especially those familiar with trying to ignore existing legal obligations (under a motto like 'seek forgiveness, not permission'), such as Waymo or Uber, could be normally expected to try to avoid responsibility to the maximum degree possible, there is potential for attempt to let the operators evade being held liable for accidents while they are in control.

As higher levels of automation are commercially introduced (level 3 and 4), the insurance industry may see a greater proportion of commercial and product liability lines while personal automobile insurance shrinks.&lt;ref name="KPMG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marketplace of change: Automobile insurance in the era of autonomous vehicles|url=https://home.kpmg.com/us/en/home/insights/2016/05/era-of-autonomous-vehicles-survey.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vehicular communication systems ==
{{main|Vehicular communication systems}}Individual vehicles may benefit from information obtained from other vehicles in the vicinity, especially information relating to traffic congestion and safety hazards. Vehicular communication systems use vehicles and roadside units as the communicating [[Node (networking)|nodes]] in a peer-to-peer network, providing each other with information. As a cooperative approach, vehicular communication systems can allow all cooperating vehicles to be more effective. According to a 2010 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicular communication systems could help avoid up to 79 percent of all traffic accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/DOT/NHTSA/NVS/Crash%20Avoidance/Technical%20Publications/2010/811381.pdf|title=Frequency of Target Crashes for IntelliDrive Safety Systems|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, computer scientists at the University of Texas in Austin began developing smart intersections designed for automated cars. The intersections will have no traffic lights and no stop signs, instead using computer programs that will communicate directly with each car on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/video/2012/03/22/no-lights-no-signs-no-accidents-future-i?videoId=232193655|title=No lights, no signs, no accidents – future intersections for driverless cars (video)|date=22 March 2012|access-date=28 April 2012|publisher=Reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An efficient intersection management technique called Crossroads was proposed in 2017 that is robust to network delay of V2I communication and [[Worst-case execution time|Worst-case Execution time]] of the intersection manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/crossroads-time-sensitive-autonomous-intersection-management-tech|title=Crossroads: Time-Sensitive Autonomous Intersection Management Technique|date=18 June 2017|publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 survey of 1,500 consumers across 10 countries by [[Cisco Systems]] found 57% "stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver", with Brazil, India and China the most willing to trust automated technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosphere.ca/collisionmanagement/2013/05/22/autonomous-cars-found-trustworthy-in-global-study/|title=Autonomous Cars Found Trustworthy in Global Study|date=22 May 2013|publisher=autosphere.ca|access-date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 US telephone survey by Insurance.com, over three-quarters of licensed drivers said they would at least consider buying a self-driving car, rising to 86% if car insurance were cheaper. 31.7% said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insurance.com/about-us/news-and-events/2014/07/autonomous-cars-bring-em-on-drivers-say-in-insurance.com-survey.html|title=Autonomous cars: Bring 'em on, drivers say in Insurance.com survey|date=28 July 2014|website=Insurance.com|access-date=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a February 2015 survey of top auto journalists, 46% predict that either Tesla or Daimler will be the first to the market with a fully autonomous vehicle, while (at 38%) Daimler is predicted to be the most functional, safe, and in-demand autonomous vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.partcatalog.com/blog/autonomous-vehicle-predictions/|title=Autonomous Vehicle Predictions: Auto Experts Offer Insights on the Future of Self-Driving Cars|date=16 March 2015|website=PartCatalog.com|access-date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a questionnaire survey by Delft University of Technology explored the opinion of 5,000 people from 109 countries on automated driving. Results showed that respondents, on average, found manual driving the most enjoyable mode of driving. 22% of the respondents did not want to spend any money for a fully automated driving system. Respondents were found to be most concerned about software hacking/misuse, and were also concerned about legal issues and safety. Finally, respondents from more developed countries (in terms of lower accident statistics, higher education, and higher income) were less comfortable with their vehicle transmitting data.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyriakidis|first1=M.|last2=Happee|first2=R.|last3=De Winter|first3=J.

In 2016, a survey in Germany examined the opinion of 1,603 people, who were representative in terms of age, gender, and education for the German population, towards partially, highly, and fully automated cars. Results showed that men and women differ in their willingness to use them. Men felt less anxiety and more joy towards automated cars, whereas women showed the exact opposite. The gender difference towards anxiety was especially pronounced between young men and women but decreased with participants' age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hohenberger|first1=C.|last2=Spörrle|first2=M.|last3=Welpe|first3=I.

In 2016, a [[PwC]] survey, in the United States, showing the opinion of 1,584 people, highlights that "66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver". People are still worried about safety and mostly the fact of having the car hacked. Nevertheless, only 13% of the interviewees see no advantages in this new kind of cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/22/autonomous-cars-seen-as-smarter-than-human-drivers/|title=Autonomous cars seen as smarter than human drivers|first=Kristen|last=Hall-Geisler|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 December 2016|access-date=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Pew Research Center survey of 4,135 U.S. adults conducted 1–15 May 2017 finds that many Americans anticipate significant impacts from various automation technologies in the course of their lifetimes—from the widespread adoption of automated vehicles to the replacement of entire job categories with robot workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/10/04/automation-in-everyday-life/|title=Automation in Everyday Life|last=Smith|first=Aaaron|last2=Anderson|first2=Monica |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moral issues ==
With the emergence of automated automobiles various ethical issues arise. While the introduction of automated vehicles to the mass market is said to be inevitable due to an (untestable) potential for reduction of crashes by "up to" 90%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Preparing a nation for autonomous vehicles: Opportunities, barriers and policy recommendations.|journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice|volume=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their potential greater accessibility to disabled, elderly, and young passengers, a range of ethical issues have not been fully addressed. Those include, but are not limited to: the moral, financial, and criminal responsibility for crashes and breaches of law; the decisions a car is to make right before a (fatal) crash; privacy issues including potential for mass surveillance; potential for massive job losses and unemployment among drivers; de-skilling and loss of independence by vehicle users; exposure to hacking and malware; and the further concentration of market and data power in the hands of a few global conglomerates capable of consolidating AI capacity, and of lobbying governments to facilitate the shift of liability onto others and their potential destruction of existing occupations and industries.

There are different opinions on who should be held liable in case of a crash, especially with people being hurt. Many experts see the car manufacturers themselves responsible for those crashes that occur due to a technical malfunction or misconstruction.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Responsibility for Crashes of Autonomous Vehicles: An Ethical Analysis|journal=Sci Eng Ethics|volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the fact that the car manufacturer would be the source of the problem in a situation where a car crashes due to a technical issue, there is another important reason why car manufacturers could be held responsible: it would encourage them to innovate and heavily invest into fixing those issues, not only due to protection of the brand image, but also due to financial and criminal consequences. However, there are also voices [who?] that argue those using or owning the vehicle should be held responsible since they know the risks involved in using such a vehicle. Experts [who?] suggest introducing a tax or insurances that would protect owners and users of automated vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include software engineers that programmed the code for the automated operation of the vehicles, and suppliers of components of the AV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Coming Collision Between Autonomous Vehicles and the Liability System|journal=Santa Clara Law Review|volume=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking aside the question of legal liability and moral responsibility, the question arises how automated vehicles should be programmed to behave in an emergency situation where either passengers or other traffic participants like: pedestrians, bicyclists and other drivers are endangered. A moral dilemma that a software engineer or car manufacturer might face in programming the operating software is described in an ethical thought experiment, the trolley problem: a conductor of a trolley has the choice of staying on the planned track and running over 5 people, or turn the trolley onto a track where it would kill only one person, assuming there is no traffic on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Trolley Problem|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=94|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a self-driving car is in following scenario: it's driving with passengers and suddenly a person appears in its way. The car has to decide between the two options, either to run the person over or to avoid hitting the person by swerving into a wall, killing the passengers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Himmelreich|first=Johannes|date=2018-05-17|title=Never Mind the Trolley: The Ethics of Autonomous Vehicles in Mundane Situations|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10677-018-9896-4|journal=Ethical Theory and Moral Practice|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=669–684|doi=10.1007/s10677-018-9896-4|issn=1386-2820}}&lt;/ref&gt;.There are two main considerations that need to be addressed. First, what moral basis would be used by an automated vehicle to make decisions? Second, how could those be translated into software code? Researchers have suggested, in particular, two ethical theories to be applicable to the behavior of automated vehicles in cases of emergency: [[Deontological ethics|deontology]] and [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Road vehicle automation|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=TxmfDAAAQBAJ}}|last=Meyer|first=G.|last2=Beiker|first2=S|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=93–102|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics|three laws of robotics]] are a typical example of deontological ethics. The theory suggests that an automated car needs to follow strict written-out rules that it needs to follow in any situation. Utilitarianism suggests the idea that any decision must be made based on the goal to maximize utility. This needs a definition of utility which could be maximizing the number of people surviving in a crash. Critics suggest that automated vehicles should adapt a mix of multiple theories to be able to respond morally right in the instance of a crash.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

(Many 'Trolley' discussions skip over the practical problems of how a probabilistic machine learning vehicle AI could be sophisticated enough to understand that a deep problem of moral philosophy is presenting itself from instant to instant while using a dynamic projection into the near future, what sort of moral problem it actually would be if any, what the relevant weightings in human value terms should be given to all the other humans involved who will be probably unreliably identified, and how reliably it can assess the probable outcomes. These practical difficulties, and those around testing and assessment of solutions to them, may present as much of a challenge as the theoretical abstractions.)

Privacy-related issues arise mainly from the interconnectivity of automated cars, making it just another mobile device that can gather any information about an individual. This information gathering ranges from tracking of the routes taken, voice recording, video recording, preferences in media that is consumed in the car, behavioral patterns, to many more streams of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/self-driving-cars-and-the-looming-privacy-apocalypse/474600/|title=How Self-Driving Cars Will Threaten Privacy|last=Lafrance|first=Adrienne|date=21 March 2016|work=|access-date=4 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jack|first=Boeglin|date=1 January 2015|title=The Costs of Self-Driving Cars: Reconciling Freedom and Privacy with Tort Liability in Autonomous Vehicle Regulation|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yjolt/vol17/iss1/4|journal=Yale Journal of Law and Technology|volume=17|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data and communications infrastructure needed to support these vehicles may also be capable of surveillance, especially if coupled to other data sets and advanced analytics.

The implementation of automated vehicles to the mass market might cost up to 5 million jobs in the US alone, making up almost 3% of the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-greenhouse-driverless-job-loss-20160922-snap-story.html|title=Autonomous vehicles could cost America 5 million jobs.

=== In literature ===
Intelligent or self-driving cars are a common theme in [[science fiction]] literature. Examples include:
* In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s science-fiction short story, "[[Sally (short story)|Sally]]" (first published May–June 1953), automated cars have "[[positronic brain]]s" and communicate via honking horns and slamming doors, and save their human caretaker. Due to the high cost of the brain, few can afford a personal vehicle, so buses have become the norm.
* [[Peter F. Hamilton]]'s ''[[Commonwealth Saga]]'' series features intelligent or self-driving vehicles.
* In [[Robert A Heinlein]]'s novel, ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'' (1980), Zeb Carter's driving and flying car "Gay Deceiver" is at first semi-automated and later, after modifications by Zeb's wife Deety, becomes sentient and capable of fully autonomous operation.
* In [[Edizioni Piemme]]'s series ''[[Geronimo Stilton]]'', a robotic vehicle called "Solar" is in the 54th book.
* [[Alastair Reynolds]]' series, ''[[Revelation Space]]'', features intelligent or self-driving vehicles.
* In [[Daniel Suarez (author)|Daniel Suarez]]' novels ''[[Daemon (novel series)|Daemon]]'' (2006) and ''[[Freedom™]]'' (2010) driverless cars and motorcycles are used for attacks in a software-based [[open-source warfare]]. The vehicles are modified for this using [[3D printers]] and [[distributed manufacturing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://t3n.de/news/3d-drucker-industrie-trend-453581/|title=3D-Drucker: Warum die Industrie wieder einen Trend verschläft|publisher=t3n News|language=de|access-date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are also able to operate as [[Swarm robotics|swarms]].

=== In television ===
* "[[CSI: Cyber]]" Season 2, episode 6, ''Gone in 60 Seconds'', features three seemingly normal customized vehicles, a 2009 [[Nissan Fairlady Z]] Roadster, a [[BMW M3]] E90 and a [[Cadillac CTS-V]], and one stock luxury [[BMW 7 Series]], being remote-controlled by a computer hacker.
* "[[Handicar]]", season 18, episode 4 of 2014 TV series ''[[South Park]]'' features a Japanese automated car that takes part in the ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]''-style car race.
* [[KITT]] and [[KARR (Knight Rider)|KARR]], the [[Pontiac Trans Am|Pontiac Firebird Trans-Am]]s in the 1982 TV series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', were sentient and autonomous. The KITT and KARR based [[Ford Mustang (fifth generation)|Ford Mustangs]] from [[Knight Rider (2008 TV series)|Knight Rider]] were also sentient and autonomous, like their Firebird counterparts.
* "Driven", series 4 episode 11 of the 2003 TV series [[NCIS (season 4)|''NCIS'']] features a robotic vehicle named "Otto", part of a high-level project of the Department of Defense, which causes the death of a Navy Lieutenant, and then later almost kills Abby.
* The TV series "[[Viper (TV series)|Viper]]" features a silver/grey armored assault vehicle, called ''The Defender'', which masquerades as a flame-red 1992 [[Dodge Viper]] RT/10 and later as a 1998 cobalt blue [[Dodge Viper GTS]]. The vehicle's sophisticated computer systems allow it to be controlled via remote on some occasions.
* "[[Black Mirror]]" episode "[[Hated in the Nation]]" briefly features a self-driving SUV with a touchscreen interface on the inside.
* ''Bull'' has a show discussing the effectiveness and safety of self-driving cars in an episode call E.J.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartermatt.com/237808/bull-episode-10-preview-self-driving-car-case-ginny-bretton/|title='Bull' episode 10 preview: The self-driving car case and Ginny Bretton|date=3 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caltech-Submillimeter-Observatory (straightened).jpg|thumb|The [[Caltech Submillimeter Observatory]] at [[Mauna Kea Observatory]] was commissioned in 1988, and has a 10.4 m(34 ft) dish]]

'''Submillimetre astronomy''' or '''submillimeter astronomy''' (see [[spelling differences]]) is the branch of [[observational astronomy]] that is conducted at submillimetre wavelengths (i.e., [[terahertz radiation]]) of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Astronomers place the submillimetre waveband between the [[far-infrared]] and [[microwave]] wavebands, typically taken to be between a few hundred [[micrometre]]s and a [[millimetre]]. It is still common in submillimetre astronomy to quote wavelengths in 'microns', the old name for micrometre.

Using submillimetre observations, astronomers examine [[molecular cloud]]s and [[Dark nebula|dark cloud]] cores with a goal of clarifying the process of [[star formation]] from earliest [[gravitational collapse|collapse]] to [[Stellar birthline|stellar birth]].  Submillimetre observations of these dark clouds can be used to determine [[Astrochemistry|chemical abundances]] and [[Interstellar medium#Heating and cooling|cooling mechanisms]] for the [[List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules|molecules which comprise them]].  In addition, submillimetre observations give information on the mechanisms for the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation and evolution of galaxies]].

==Submillimetre astronomy from the ground==
[[File:ALMA’s World At Night.jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of the Chajnantor plateau, spanning about 180 degrees from north (on the left) to south (on the right) shows the antennas of the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]].]]

The most significant limitation to the detection of astronomical emission at submillimetre wavelengths with ground-based observatories is atmospheric emission, noise and attenuation. Like the infrared, the submillimetre atmosphere is dominated by numerous [[water vapour]] [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption bands]] and it is only through "windows" between these bands that observations are possible. The ideal submillimetre observing site is dry, cool, has stable weather conditions and is away from urban population centres. There are only a handful of such sites identified, they include [[Mauna Kea Observatory|Mauna Kea]] ([[Hawaii]], United States), the [[Llano de Chajnantor Observatory]] on the Atacama Plateau ([[Chile]]), the [[South Pole]], and Hanle in India (the Himalayan site of the [[Indian Astronomical Observatory]]). Comparisons show that all four sites are excellent for submillimetre astronomy, and of these sites Mauna Kea is the most established and arguably the most accessible. There has been some recent interest in high-altitude Arctic sites, particularly [[Summit Camp|Summit Station]] in Greenland where the PWV ([[precipitable water]] vapor) measure is always better than at Mauna Kea (however Mauna Kea's equatorial latitude of 19 degrees means it can observe more of the southern skies than Greenland).&lt;ref name=ellesmere&gt;{{cite web | url=http://almatelescope.ca/submmFuture-17feb2012/Presentations/Steinbring-Arctic.pdf | title=Recent Interest in Eureka on Ellesmere Island as a Submillimetre Observing Site | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703235656/http://almatelescope.ca/submmFuture-17feb2012/Presentations/Steinbring-Arctic.pdf | archivedate=2015-07-03 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=summit&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~hirashita/dust_group/JuanCarlos220811.pdf | title=ASIAA sub-mm VLBI Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Llano de Chajnantor Observatory]] site hosts the [[Atacama Pathfinder Experiment]] (APEX), the largest submillimetre telescope operating in the southern hemisphere,
and the world's largest ground based astronomy project, the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA), an [[Astronomical radio interferometry|interferometer]] for submillimetre wavelength observations made of 54 12-metre and 12 7-metre radio telescopes. The [[Submillimeter Array]] (SMA) is another interferometer, located at Mauna Kea, consisting of eight 6-metre diameter radio telescopes. The largest existing submillimetre telescope, the [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope]], is also located on Mauna Kea.

==Submillimetre astronomy from near-space==
With [[high-altitude balloon]]s and aircraft, one can get above even more of the atmosphere.  The [[BLAST (telescope)|BLAST]] experiment and [[SOFIA]] are two examples, respectively, although SOFIA can also handle near infrared observations.

Space-based observations at the submillimetre wavelengths remove the ground-based limitations of atmospheric absorption.  The [[Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite]] (SWAS) was launched into low Earth orbit on December 5, 1998 as one of [[NASA]]'s Small Explorer Program (SMEX) missions.  The mission of the spacecraft is to make targeted observations of giant molecular clouds and dark cloud cores.  The focus of SWAS is five spectral lines: [[water]] (H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;O), isotopic water (H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;18&lt;/SUP&gt;O), isotopic [[carbon monoxide]] (&lt;SUP&gt;13&lt;/SUP&gt;CO), molecular [[oxygen]] (O&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;), and neutral [[carbon]] (C I).

The SWAS satellite was repurposed in June, 2005 to provide support for the NASA ''[[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]]'' mission.  SWAS provided water production data on the comet until the end of August 2005.

The [[European Space Agency]] launched a space-based mission known as the [[Herschel Space Observatory]] (formerly called Far Infrared and Sub-millimetre Telescope or FIRST) in 2009.  Herschel  deploys the largest mirror ever launched into space and studies radiation in the far infrared and submillimetre wavebands.  Rather than an Earth orbit, Herschel entered into a [[Lissajous orbit]] around {{L2}}, the second [[Lagrangian point]] of the Earth-Sun system.  {{L2}} is located approximately 1.5 million km from Earth and the placement of Herschel there lessens the interference by infrared and visible radiation from the Earth and Sun.  Herschel's mission focuses primarily on the origins of galaxies and galactic formation.

==History==

===Sweet Briar plantation===
The college is named after the former plantation of [[Elijah Fletcher]] and his descendants. Fletcher was a 19th-century teacher, businessman and mayor of [[Lynchburg, Virginia]]. He married Maria Antoinette Crawford in 1813, and purchased the Sweet Briar plantation property from her aunt and uncle. The plantation was initially known as Locust Ridge; Crawford supposedly renamed it "Sweet Briar" after the roses which grew on the land. Their daughter, Indiana Fletcher, was born in 1828 in Lynchburg.

Indiana attended the [[Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School]], [[Doane Academy]], and later toured Europe with her brother and sister. She met [[J. Henry Williams|James Henry Williams]], a student at [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] in 1858, and after reuniting in Virginia following the American Civil War, they were married in 1865. Their daughter, Maria Georgiana "Daisy" Williams, was born in 1867. At Elijah Fletcher's death, Indiana inherited the plantation. James Williams gave up his initial career as a clergyman to maintain the property. Daisy Williams died at the age of 16 in 1884. Both James and Indiana Fletcher-Williams were devastated at her death, and James expressed a wish in his own will that a school might be established in honor of Daisy. William died in 1889, leaving his entire estate to his wife, and Indiana's brother Sidney also gave her additional property upon his death in 1898. When Indiana died in 1900, she bequeathed Sweet Briar plantation to become a school for young women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stohlman|first1=Martha Lou Lemmon|title=The story of Sweet Briar College.|date=1956|publisher=Alumnae Association of Sweet Briar College}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fletcher-Williams Family|url=http://sbc.edu/museum/fletcher-williams-family|website=Sweet Briar College|publisher=Sweet Briar College museum|accessdate=31 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910102059/http://sbc.edu/museum/fletcher-williams-family|archivedate=10 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By his death in 1858, Elijah Fletcher owned over 110 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gore|first1=Sherese|title=The enslaved founders: Letters from 1800s reveal life on 'Sweetbrier' plantation|url=http://www.newsadvance.com/new_era_progress/news/the-enslaved-founders-letters-from-s-reveal-life-on-sweetbrier/article_f675b944-de21-11e4-b1ef-23f622d62746.html|website=New Era Progress – Amherst County|publisher=News Advance|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] in 1865, several former slaves and descendants of slaves continued to work for pay and live at Sweet Briar, including Martha Penn Taylor, who worked for three generations of the Fletcher-Williams family, and Signora Hollins (who was Indiana Fletcher's childhood playmate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African American Heritage at Sweet Briar|url=http://tusculum.sbc.edu/africanamericans/|website=African American Heritage at Sweet Briar College|publisher=Tusculum Institute at Sweet Briar College|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biographies|url=http://tusculum.sbc.edu/africanamericans/biographies_list.shtml|website=African American Heritage at Sweet Briar College|publisher=Tusculum Institute at Sweet Briar College|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some descendants of the slaves owned by the family still work at the college, and others hold family reunions on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Svrluga|first1=Susan|title=For a family whose ancestors were slaves at the Sweet Briar plantation, a loss|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/04/06/for-a-family-whose-ancestors-were-slaves-at-the-sweet-briar-plantation-a-loss/|accessdate=7 April 2015|agency=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indiana Fletcher Williams' bequest and official opening===
In 1901, with the assistance of then Virginia state senator [[Carter Glass]], the Virginia General Assembly issued a charter to Sweet Briar Institute as indicated in the will of Indiana Fletcher Williams. The will stated that the land of Sweet Briar plantation must be used as a "school or seminary to be known as the 'Sweet Briar institute,' for the education of white girls and young women. It shall be the general scope and object of the school to impart to its students such education in sound learning, and such physical, moral and religious training as shall, in the judgment of the directors, best fit them to be useful members of society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Archive.org|title=Copy of the Charter of Sweet Briar Institute and of the Amendments of Said Charter|url=https://archive.org/stream/copyofcharterofs00unse/copyofcharterofs00unse_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, Sweet Briar College officially opened with 51 students and granted its first AB degrees in 1910. In 1932, Sweet Briar's study abroad exchange program with the [[University of St. Andrews]], Scotland, was established. In 1948, the renowned Junior Year in France (JYF) program was launched, followed by a number of other study abroad programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SWEET BRIAR PLANS STUDY GROUP IN PARIS|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/108141973?accountid=9758|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=Jan 13, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://sbc.edu/about/history|website=Sbc.edu|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweet Briar College JYF|url=http://www.jyf.sbc.edu/|website=Sbc.edu|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil Rights era changes===
Legal action to alter Indiana Fletcher Williams' will was required to admit African-American students, as it had limited the purpose of the college to the education of solely white women.&lt;ref name="ia700502.us.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abrams|first1=Mary Malyneux|title=Thank You Mr. Newman: Re-Interpreting the Will of Indiana Fletcher Williams|url=https://archive.org/details/alumnaemagazine722swee|website=Archive.org|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 17, 1964, wishing to eliminate "white" from the charter and comply with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], Sweet Briar filed a bill of complaint with the Amherst County Circuit Court. The request was initially denied at the state level, with the Commonwealth's Attorney General stating that the will was "plain, unambiguous, conclusive, and binding".

After several years of unsuccessful state litigation, the college filed a complaint with the federal [[United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia]]. On April 25, 1966, Judge [[Thomas J. Michie]] issued a temporary restraining order that prevented enforcement of the racial restriction. On July 17, 1967, a three-judge Charlottesville court confirmed permanence of the restraining order. The first African-American student, [[Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp]], was admitted to the college in September 1966.&lt;ref name="ia700502.us.archive.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sbc.edu/news/alumnae-and-development/change-long/ |title=A little change goes a long way &amp;#124; Sweet Briar College News |publisher=Sbc.edu |date=2013-06-14 |accessdate=2015-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Supreme Court of the United States, October term 1966 : Sweet Briar Institute, appellant, v.

===2015 closure attempt===

====Pending closure announced by board====
On March 3, 2015, the college's board of directors, following a unanimous vote on February 28, 2015, announced the college would close on August 25, 2015, due to "insurmountable financial challenges". They cited declining enrollment and an endowment insufficient to cover potentially large-scale changes needed to boost enrollment, like coeducation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kapsidelis|first1=Karin |title=Sweet Briar College to close | url= http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/article_105c880d-25d1-5305-be18-8d5f08c50776.html| work =Richmond Times-Dispatch |accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible factor presented by the board was a declining interest in the traditional women's college model.&lt;ref&gt;dukechronicle.com, [http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2015/03/17/all-womens-colleges-face-challenges#.VQywB473-iy All women's colleges face challenges], March 17, 2015 (Retrieved 3-20-15)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The college's architecture is dominated by the work of [[Ralph Adams Cram]], who also lent his architectural expertise to the campuses of [[Princeton University]] and [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], among others. Although Cram's forte was [[Gothic Revival]], he designed Sweet Briar in the [[Colonial Revival]] style, using red brick buildings with white balustrades and arcades.&lt;ref&gt;archive.org, "[https://archive.org/details/ralphadamscramar00cham The Ralph Adams Cram Architecture of Sweet Briar College]," Chambers, S.

Near to Shopian a town about 40&amp;nbsp;km away from Srinagar, Kashmir two women were found dead on the banks of Rambiara Nala, the autopsies were conducted by a team of doctors of Kashmir including one lady doctor. The cause of death was given as head injury. The vaginal swabs were preserved which were positive for spermatozoa at FSL Srinagar. There was agitation led by Majlis Musharraf in Kashmir. The police officers were arrested. The matter was taken by Kashmir High court Suo moto. CBI was entrusted with investigations who engaged Professor T D Dogra as chairman of the team of experts, which included experts from CFSL(central forensic laboratory New Delhi) and AIIMS New Delhi. After exhumation and exhaustive examination,  Board of experts concluded that cause of death was drowning and it was a case of deception because vaginal swabs did not belong to the deceased ladies, these were of the source other than the two deceased ladies, it was concluded by DNA Profiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/tag/shopian/page/5/|title=CBI submits Shopian exhumation report to court|publisher=The Indian Express|date=13 October 2009|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/shopian-case-cbi-exhumes-bodies-402272|publisher=NDTV|date=28 September 2009|title=Shopian case: CBI exhumes bodies|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Torque density''' is a measure of the torque-carrying capability of a mechanical component. It is the ratio of torque capability to volume and is expressed in units of torque per volume.  Torque density is a system [[property]] since it depends on the design of each element of the component being examined and their interconnection.  

Torque density is useful during the [[concept]] evaluation stage of mechanical [[design]]s, especially in [[power train]] design problems. Typically, it will be one of many factors used to assign potential success measures to each concept. For example, in the upgrade of a drive train for a set of rolls in a [[rolling mill]], space is often dictated by the configuration of current components.  There may be several types of devices that can perform the function of an existing component that must be replaced. The relative torque densities of the devices may be an important determinant for which design is ultimately selected, although it will often compete with other factors such as cost, ease of maintenance, time to install, operating costs and potential failure modes.

==Units==
In [[SI|SI units]], torque density is expressed in [[joule]]s per [[cubic metre]] or equivalently [[newton (unit)|newton]]-[[metre]]s per [[cubic metre]] (though dimensionally equivalent to the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]], that is usually not used for this purpose). Small amounts can be expressed in newton-[[millimetre]]s per cubic millimetre. 

In [[U.S. customary units]], torque density is expressed in [[foot-pound force|foot-pounds force]] per cubic foot, or [[inch]]-pounds force per cubic inch or [[pound-force|ounce-force]] inches per cubic inch.

The '''trace''' in [[semiotics]]{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} is a concept developed by [[Jacques Derrida]] in [[Writing and Difference]] to denote the history that a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] carries with it as the result of its use through time.{{page needed|date=March 2011}} Words like "black", for example, carry the trace of all their previous uses with them, making them sensitive, loaded words when used in any context. The trace then reveals the possibility for alternative interpretation of concepts, regardless of how carefully articulated they may be, whenever they are expressed in language.

{{See also|Transparency of media ownership in Europe}}

[[Transparency of media ownership in Europe|Transparency of media ownership]] refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures to make possible for media authority and the wider public to ascertain who effectively owns and controls the media. Between 2011 and 2012, following some concerns on opaque activities which accompanied the process of [[privatisation of the media in Croatia]], the government initiated the reform of the law on transparency of media ownership with the aim to avoid the concealment of information on media ownership structure.

The Croatian law provides the disclosure of information that are sufficient to establish who formally holds shares in the [[Media of Croatia|media organisations operating in Croatia]]. However, in practice, some obstacles have been observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/12124 Access-Info Europe, Croatia TMO consultation, July 2013. Retrieved 19 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some unclear aspects in the new legal framework which is the result of uncoordinated legal developments needed to complement the original Media Act with provisions to be applied to electronic media, which emerged several years later and that are now covered by a dedicated law, namely the Electronic Media Law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/12124 Access-Info Europe, July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In general terms, the information disclosed can be accessed by the public at large, but, as a matter of fact, this is quite uncommon. In Croatia, the public debate on media ownership transparency developed only recently, in connection with the amendments to the Media Act and Electronic Media Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/12124 Access-Info Europe, July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==General overview==
{{See also|Transparency of media ownership in Europe}}

Transparency of media ownership refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures. It is an essential component of any democratic media system and its crucial for [[media pluralism]] and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2013/12/11/the-transparency-of-media-ownership/ Mark Thompson, Media Plurality Series: The Transparency of Media Ownership, 11 December 2013. Retrieved 31 August 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes available all the information needed for finding out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies. The importance of transparency of media ownership for any democratic and pluralist society has been broadly recognised by the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Commission's High-Level Group on Media Freedom and Pluralism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2013/12/11/the-transparency-of-media-ownership/ Mark Thompson, 11 December 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Council of Europe]].

To ensure that the public knows who effectively owns and influences the media, national legal frameworks should ensure the disclosure of at least the following basic information:
* name and contact details of the media outlets; 
* constitutional documents; size of shareholdings over a given threshold;
* name and contact details of direct owners with a given percentage of shareholding;
* identity of the persons with indirect control or have a significant interest in a given media company;
* citizenship/residence status of individuals with at least a certain shareholding percentage;
* country of domicile of company with at least a given shareholding percentage.

Importantly, to understand who really owns and controls a specific media outlet it is necessary to check who is beyond the official [[Shareholder|shareholdings]] and scrutinise indirect, controlling and [[beneficial ownership]] which refers on shares of a media company hold on behalf of another person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/TMO_Recommendations_05_November_2013.pdf Access-Info Europe, 4 November 2013, Ten recommendations on transparency of media ownership, 4 November 2013. Retrieved 30 August 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; To be meaningful and easily accessible by the citizens and national media authorities, this information should be updated, searchable, free and reusable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/TMO_Recommendations_05_November_2013.pdf Access-Info Europe, 4 November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|Media of Croatia}}

In 2011, concerns about opaque media financial flows led to changes to the laws regulating media ownership transparency to make possible the identification of media owners beyond a company back to individuals. Indeed, the relevant laws have been updated to ensure better ownership transparency of media publishers, in particular to avoid the concealment of the real media ownership structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/12124 Access-Info Europe, July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The process of privatisation of the print media in Croatia, which began in 2000, had been accompanied by corruption scandals and rumours of [[money laundering]] and the involvement of criminal groups in the sales of the biggest Croatian newspapers, i.e. ''[[Jutarnji list]]'', ''[[Večernji list|Večerni List]]'' and ''[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/13230 Access Info-Europe, Country case study: Croatia, 2013. Retrieved 19 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The names of the real owners of these media was hidden behind secret contracts and informal agreements involving politicians, police and other high-profile individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/13230 Access Info-Europe, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Changes to the Media Act and the Electronic Media Act were very quick and passed with limited consultation by the Parliament in July 2011 for the Media Act and in June 2012 for the Electronic Media Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/13230 Access Info-Europe, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==
Transparency of media ownership in Croatia is regulated by the Media Law (2011) and the Electronic Media Law (2012). These rules apply to all the media sectors, i.e. print, broadcast and online media which are required to regularly provide and update information on their shareholders. These laws contain provisions for disclosing ownership information to: the relevant media authorities, i.e. the Electronic Media Council in the case on online media (Electronic Media Act); to independent professional and business organisations such as the Croatian Chamber of Economy and other corporate and trade registers (Media Act); or directly to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/13230 Access Info-Europe, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In general terms, the Croatian legal framework requires media to reveal enough information to make possible the identification of their owners, be it an individual or a company. This includes data on all [[Shareholder|shareholdings]] over 1%, disclosure of [[beneficial ownership]] and of people with indirect interests and control as well as a prohibition on "secret" ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/13230 Access Info-Europe, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The information disclosed are provided directly to the public via the web and Official Gazette.

Upon request, the Croatian Chamber of Economy, which is responsible for collecting ownership data, must guarantee [[public access to the information]] submitted to it. This is in compliance with the recognised [[right of access to information]] under the Act on the Right to Access Information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/12124 Access-Info Europe, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendments have had little impact on the ownership structure of Croatian media, which remain questionable. This is because most of the privatisation, which in many cases was reported to be suspicious or controversial, were completed before the amended laws entered into force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/13230 Access Info-Europe, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transparency of media ownership in practice==
Despite the good provisions enshrined in the reformed legal framework which built upon existing obligations, the lack of consultation that led to the amendments to the Media Act and the Electronic Media Act resulted in a series of shortcomings especially with regard to monitoring and enforcement of the laws. For instance, in practice, media companies in Croatia do not always comply with their obligation to publish information on indirect ownership and the law doesn't foresee a mechanism for monitoring, checking compliance and apply sanctions. Indeed, the Media act does not provide for effective mechanism enabling the Croatian Chamber of Economy to check that the information received are updated and correct. Given the scarcity of resources assigned to it, the Chamber has to rely on the assistance of other authorities such as the Croatian Competition Agency and the Company Register.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/12124 Access-Info Europe, July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Another critical point of the Croatian system regulating transparency of media ownership is that it does not guarantee the full disclosure of information on individuals holding shares of a media company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/13230 Access Info-Europe, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, often the name of a company is not enough for providing information on the individuals behind it. For example, on the basis of the information provided under the law regulating transparency of media ownership the media companies ''Europa digital d.o.o''., ''Slobodna Dalmacija'', ''EPH Media'' and ''Gloria Groupa'' apparently don't have anything in common, but they are all subsidiary companies within the ''[[Hanza Media|EPH group]]'', owned by ''[[Funke Mediengruppe|WAZ]]'' and the businessman [[Ninoslav Pavić]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediaobservatory.net/sites/default/files/media%20integrity%20matters_za%20web_1.pdf Media integrity matters: reclaiming public service values in media and journalism / &amp;#91;editor Brankica Petković ; assistant editor Jovana Mihajlović Trbovc&amp;#93;. – 1st ed. – Ljubljana : Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies, 2014. Retrieved 19 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in practice, media outlets do not always disclose information on indirect ownership as required by the law. For example, the only shareholder listed for the media company ''Vecernji list d.d''., which issues the daily paper ''[[Večernji list|Vecernji list]]'' is Styria Media International AG from Graz. Other relevant ownership information are not disclosed, for instance information regarding the important shareholders of Styra Media International AG or whether that company holds some shares for another person or a company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/12124 Access-Info Europe, July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the publication of data in the Official Gazette is not monitored and since there is there is not a special issue of the Official Gazette listing the updates occurred during the year the search is complex and time-consuming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediaobservatory.net/sites/default/files/media%20integrity%20matters_za%20web_1.pdf Media integrity matters: reclaiming public service values in media and journalism / &amp;#91;editor Brankica Petković ; assistant editor Jovana Mihajlović Trbovc&amp;#93;. – 1st ed. – Ljubljana : Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies, 2014. Retrieved 19 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In sum, despite the fact that the laws on transparency of media ownership are well defined, in practice is quite difficult to assess the actual ownership structures and reconstruct the networks of ownership and connected persons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediaobservatory.net/sites/default/files/media%20integrity%20matters_za%20web_1.pdf Media integrity matters: reclaiming public service values in media and journalism / &amp;#91;editor Brankica Petković ; assistant editor Jovana Mihajlović Trbovc&amp;#93;. – 1st ed. – Ljubljana : Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies, 2014. Retrieved 19 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is exacerbated by the fact that, according to the Croatian law, different agencies are in charge of collecting data on ownership – the Council for Electronic media is responsible for online media and the Croatian Chamber of Commerce for print media – without a unique centralised monitoring system working across print, radio, television and online media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monitor.cmpf.eui.eu/mpm2015/results/croatia/ Media Pluralism Monitor 2015, Croatia. Retrieved 19 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, the European Commission organised a consultative conference on transparency of media ownership and Croatia was mentioned as "a good practice" in this context. However, many panellists participating at the conference highlighted that it is important to insist on the improvement of the legal framework but that is not enough as, according to experts, it is more important to know who effectively controls the owners than who nominally owns the media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irex.org/sites/default/files/pdf/media-sustainability-index-europe-eurasia-2015-croatia.pdf IREX, Europe &amp; Eurasia Sustainability Index 2015 – Croatia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8382">'''Tyndale New Testament Commentaries''' (or '''TNTC''') is a series of commentaries in English on the [[New Testament]]. It is published by the [[Inter-Varsity Press]].

Constantly being revised since its first being completed, the series seek to bridge the gap between brevity and scholarly comment.

==Reviews==
{{quote|The ''Tyndale New Testament Commentaries'' are designed for the frequently-targeted well-read layperson, but many pastors profit as well. The series is conservative but focuses most attention on explaining the meaning of the text with minimal interaction with the voluminous secondary literature. Originally based on the AV/KJV, with Greek and Hebrew transliterated and explained, the series is being rewritten based on the RSV or NIV (at the individual author's discretion), and space is being assigned more equitably. Several of the volumes of this new edition are, within the constraints of the series, outstanding (e.g., Marshall on Acts). |[[D. A.

The '''University of Toronto''' ('''U of T''',&lt;!-- Do not add UT, since it is used as a part of longer abbreviations, such as UTM, UTSC, and UTSU, but not as a standalone abbreviation --&gt; '''UToronto''', or '''Toronto'''&lt;!-- Do not added Toronto U, because it would refer to Toronto University, which is an incorrect name --&gt;) is a [[public university|public]]&lt;!-- Public universities are public-assisted in nature --&gt; [[research university]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], located on the grounds that surround [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]]. It was founded by [[royal charter]] in 1827 as ''King's College'', the first institution of higher learning in the colony of [[Upper Canada]]. Originally controlled by the [[Church of England]], the university assumed the present name in 1850 upon becoming a secular institution. As a [[collegiate university]], it comprises eleven [[college]]s, which differ in character and history, each with substantial autonomy on financial and institutional affairs. It has two satellite campuses in [[University of Toronto Scarborough|Scarborough]] and [[University of Toronto Mississauga|Mississauga]].

The university is commonly [[Rankings of universities in Canada|ranked as the best Canadian university]], according to various major publications. Academically, the University of Toronto is noted for influential movements and curricula in [[literary criticism]] and [[communication theory]], known collectively as the [[Toronto School of communication theory|Toronto School]]. The university was the birthplace of [[insulin]] and [[stem cell]] research, and was the site of the first practical [[electron microscope]], the development of [[multi-touch]] technology, the identification of the first [[black hole]] [[Cygnus X-1]], and the development of the theory of [[NP-completeness]]. By a significant margin, it receives the most annual [[Funding of science|scientific research funding]] of any Canadian university. It is one of two members of the [[Association of American Universities]] outside the United States, the other being [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5474 |title=Association of American Universities |publisher=Aau.edu |accessdate=2012-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114071434/http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5474 |archivedate=January 14, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Toronto Varsity Blues|Varsity Blues]] are the athletic teams that represent the university in intercollegiate league matches, with long and storied ties to [[gridiron football]] and [[ice hockey]]. The earliest recorded [[college football]] game was played in the University of Toronto's University College in the 1860s. The university's [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]] is an early example of the North American [[student center|student centre]], simultaneously serving cultural, intellectual, and recreational interests within its large [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic-revival]] complex.

The University of Toronto has educated three [[Governor General of Canada|Governors General of Canada]], four [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Ministers of Canada]], four foreign leaders, and fourteen [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada|Justices of the Supreme Court]]. As of 2018, [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|ten Nobel laureates]], [[List of Turing Award laureates by university affiliation|three Turing Award winners]], 94 Rhodes Scholars, and [[List of Fields Medal winners by university affiliation|one Fields Medalist]] have been affiliated with the university.

[[CIUT-FM]] is the university's [[campus radio]] station, while the University of Toronto Television broadcasts student-produced content. Students at each college and academic faculty also produce their own set of journals and news publications.  University College's ''[[The Gargoyle (newspaper)|The Gargoyle]]'' was an early training ground for such notables as journalist [[Naomi Klein]], and musician/comedian [[Paul Shaffer]].  Victoria University's ''[[Acta Victoriana]]'' is the oldest active literary journal in Canada, and provided first publication credits to such literary figures as [[Margaret Atwood]] and [[Northrop Frye]].

Members of the student press have contributed to activist causes on several notable occasions. At the height of debate on coeducation in 1880, ''The Varsity'' published an article in its inaugural issue voicing in favour of admitting women.&lt;ref name="historyQA_women"/&gt; In 1895, the university suspended the editor of ''The Varsity'' for breach of collegiality, after he published a letter that harshly criticized the provincial government's dismissal of a professor and involvement in academic affairs. University College students then approved a motion by ''Varsity'' staff member and future [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and boycotted lectures for a week.&lt;ref name="historyQA_king"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bios/02/history17.htm |title=What made the "blood fairly boil" in U of T student and future prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in 1895? |accessdate=September 24, 2007 |work=History Q &amp; A |publisher=University of Toronto Department of Public Affairs |year=2002}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=7908&amp;&amp;PHPSESSID=uhlbmjtm0fc5n5ibvqbk5ipp75 |title=Dale, William |accessdate=February 28, 2009 |last=Marshall |first=David B. |work=[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]] |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] [[LGBT rights in Canada|decriminalized homosexuality throughout Canada in 1969]], a medical research assistant placed an advertisement in ''The Varsity'' seeking volunteers to establish the first university homophile association in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbebout.com/oldbeep/concep.htm |title=Conception &amp; birth |accessdate=February 28, 2009 |work=On the Origins of the Body Politic |last=Bébout |first=Rick |date=January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residences===
[[File:Teefy Hall.JPG|right|thumb|Teefy House, a residence hall of [[St. Michael's College, Toronto|St. Michael's College]], is home to female first-year undergraduate students. ]]
Each college at the University of Toronto operates its own set of [[residence hall]]s and [[Cafeteria|dining halls]] clustered in a different area of the campus. Innis, New, St. Michael's, Trinity, University, Victoria, and Woodsworth colleges reserve most of their dormitories for their undergraduate students within the Faculty of Arts and Science, while setting a portion available to students from the professional and postgraduate faculties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Engineering, Music, and Phys.

[[Annesley Hall]] of Victoria College, a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]], was the first university residence for women in Canada. After [[St. Hilda's College, University of Toronto|St. Hilda's College]] became coeducational in 2005, Annesley Hall and Loretto College of St. Michael's College are the last remaining women's halls at the university.

As campus residences accommodate just 6,400 students in all, the university guarantees housing only for undergraduates in their first year of study, while most upper-year and graduate students reside off-campus.&lt;ref name="factsandfigures"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Residence Guarantee |url=http://www.housing.utoronto.ca/residence/firstYear.html |publisher=Student Housing Service, University of Toronto |year=2008 |accessdate=March 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805003623/http://housing.utoronto.ca/residence/firstYear.html |archivedate=August 5, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the adjacent neighbourhoods of [[The Annex]] and [[Harbord Village]] are popular settling grounds for University of Toronto students, forming a distinct [[student quarter]] enclave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Middle Class and the Remaking of the Central City |last=Ley |first=David |year=1996 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-823292-6 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Schackner |title=For collegians in Canada, drinking is no big thing |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=July 8, 2007 |accessdate=March 29, 2009 |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07189/800188-51.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the university purchased and converted a nearby hotel into the [[Chestnut Residence]], which houses students from all colleges and faculties. There are also numerous fraternity houses and [[student housing cooperative]]s, where boarders pay reduced rent for assuming housekeeping duties.

'''Virginia Durr Moment''' is a phrase originating in developmental psychology which refers to an experience and "triggering event" which can foster the moral development of an individual.  Characteristic of the experience is a serious '''challenge''' to an individual's value system. The book [[Some Do Care]] by developmental psychologists [[William Damon]] and [[Anne Colby]] (who are husband and wife), use the experience of [[Virginia Foster Durr]] to describe this phenomenon.  Although Durr is known as a civil rights activist, in her early years she harbored racial prejudice—a result of her upbringing in the South. When Durr was a student at [[Wellesley College]], her prejudiced value system was first seriously challenged.&lt;ref name="Durr"&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Virginia Foster Durr Biography
  | publisher = 
  | author = 
  | date = 
  | url = http://www.teacherlink.usu.edu/tlresources/reference/champions/pdf/VirginiaFosterDurr.pdf
  | accessdate = 2007-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On her first night at Wellesley, Durr refused to dine at the same table at which a Negro girl was sitting.  The head of the house explained that the rules of [[Wellesley College]] required Durr to dine with the girl for one month, and that if Durr did not comply, she would have to withdraw from the college.  As Damon and Colby explain "this was the first time Virginia's values had ever been seriously challenged and she stayed awake all night long worrying about the dilemma".  They later go on to quote Durr "That was the first time I became aware that my attitude was considered foolish by some people and that Wellesley College wasn't going to stand for it.  That experience had a tremendous effect on me." (pg, 99, Some Do Care).   The book [[Educating Citizens]]: Preparing America's Undergraduates for Lives of Moral and Civic Responsibility, also describes the developmental significance of Durr's challenge from Wellesley: "[T]he incident lodged in Virginia's memory, creat[ed] a fracture in her convictions about race that contributed to their later destruction" (pg. 3 Educating Citizens). 

A '''Virginia Durr Moment''' refers to those experiences which—when used correctly—foster moral development. A '''Virginia Durr Moment''' presents one with the opportunity for growth via the evolution of one's value system via seriously challenging one's value system in a manner which causes one to reflect on and, as a result of this reflection, reject it in whole or in part.  When used correctly, the signature causal sequence of a '''Virginia Durr Moment''' consists in: serious challenge--&gt;self-reflection--&gt;modification of value system--&gt;moral development.  Ultimately, it is up to the individual to use the Moment to promote growth and further his/her moral development.   In the [[United Kingdom]],  some circles understand [[Paul McCartney]]'s [[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]] as describing the moral development fostered by the '''proper''' usage of a '''Virginia Durr Moment'''.  An individual may experience a '''Virginia Durr Moment''' and fail to use its power, thereby remaining in a condition of developmental stasis and moral immaturity.

The [[Scottish government]] had a target of generating 31% of [[Renewable energy in Scotland|Scotland's electricity from renewable energy]] by 2011 and 100% by 2020. The majority of this is likely to come from [[wind power]].&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

==Description==
Positioned 300 metres (985 feet) above sea level and {{convert|15|km|mi}} outside [[Glasgow]], Scotland’s largest city, the wind farm has over half a million people living within a 30&amp;nbsp;km radius&lt;!--Why is this relevant?--&gt;. This makes Whitelee one of the first large-scale wind farms to be developed close to a centre of population.&lt;ref name=white&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/05/europes-largest-onshore-wind-farm-is-switched-on-in-scotland Europe's Largest Onshore Wind Farm Is Switched on in Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, Whitelee was officially opened to the public by [[Alex Salmond]] MSP, [[First Minister for Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitelee Windfarm Officially Opened http://www.scottishpowerrenewables.com/pages/press_releases.asp?article=47&amp;date_year=2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, Whitelee was generating power more than a year before this with the first phase of the wind farm supplying power to the [[electricity grid]] in January 2008.

In May 2009, the [[Scottish Government]] granted permission for an extension to the wind farm to produce up to a further 130 megawatts of power,&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;Largest wind farm to be expanded. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8057198.stm BBC News 20 May 2009.] Retrieved 2009-05-25&lt;/ref&gt; which would increase the total generating capacity of Whitelee to 452 MW.&lt;ref name=Press&gt;[http://www.iberdrola.es/webibd/gc/prod/en/comunicacion/notasprensa/090520_NP_inauguracion_Whitelee_en.pdf Iberdrola press release dated 20 May 2009.] Retrieved 2009-05-25&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the potential to increase the generating capacity once again by 140 megawatts. This would give Whitelee the potential to generate almost 600 megawatts of renewable energy.&lt;ref name=Press/&gt;

On 19 March 2010 a blade snapped off a turbine, resulting in temporary suspension of operations until safety checks were completed. Following the accident Keith Anderson, managing director of ScottishPower Renewables, said: "This type of incident is exceptionally rare and highly unusual."&lt;ref&gt;Blade snaps off huge wind turbine.

In 2011 Scottish Power Renewables appointed the joint venture of John Sisk and Son Limited and Roadbridge, as the main contractor for an extension to Whitelee. Located to the east of the existing Whitelee Windfarm, the 75 turbine extension was planned to increase the generating capacity of the windfarm to 539MW. Turbine deliveries were planned for July 2011, with the windfarm expected to be complete in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;SPR awards Whitelee Extension Contract [http://www.whiteleewindfarm.co.uk/news/spr_awards_whitelee_extension_contract] Retrieved 2014-01-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public access and visitor centre==
{{See also|Wind turbines on public display}}
Whitelee has become an eco-tourist attraction aided by an on site visitor centre. The visitor centre is host to an interactive exhibition room, cafe, shop and education hub. It was officially opened to the public in September 2009.&lt;ref name=CentreOpening&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8263541.stm BBC News "Wind farm education centre opens"] Retrieved 2009-09-21&lt;/ref&gt; The visitor centre also gives access to a network of over 90&amp;nbsp;km of paths for cyclists, ramblers and horse riders.&lt;ref name=VisitorCentre&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8220793.stm BBC News "Visitor centre showcases windfarm"] Retrieved 2009-08-26&lt;/ref&gt;  The visitor centre is managed by [[Glasgow Science Centre]] and offers activities for education and community groups.&lt;ref name=CentreOpening/&gt;
There is also a dedicated - free - electric vehicle [[charging station]].

Whitelee wind farm has a Countryside Ranger Service operated jointly by East Renfrewshire and South Lanarkshire councils that works to promote and develop access opportunities for the public within the wind farm and wider area, as well as operating an annual program of free activities and events open to the public. The [http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/whitelee Whitelee Countryside Ranger Service] also works to encourage and assist community and charity organisations to use of access opportunities within the wind farm for fundraising and charity events. The Ranger Service forms part of the [http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=2246 Whitelee Access Planning Group] which is made up of the wind farm operators, land owners, the three local authorities the wind farm comes within, local community groups and other interested parties to the site.

In January 2014 work began on a purpose built single track mountain bike course at the windfarm, within a hollow created by a former borrow pit  that was used to supply stone during construction of the windfarm. This development is being led by East Renfrewshire Council on behalf of the Whitelee Access Planning Group. The track has been designed by Phil Saxena of Architrail Ltd – designer of the 2008 Beijing Olympic and 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games XC courses.

The project has followed strong public demand for more technical MTB facilities at Whitelee. Its setting within the UK’s largest onshore windfarm will make it unique amongst trail centres. The plans will provide graded trails to suit a wide range of users, from beginners to more experienced riders. The course will offer a mix of route options, technical sections and challenges, as well as a large picnic and viewing area, with wet weather shelters for use by families, clubs, schools etc. The facilities will extend across an area of approximately 12 hectares and will be free to use, 7 days a week.

In June 2012, Whitelee wind farm became the first wind energy project in Scotland to join the [[Association of Scottish Visitor Attractions]]. The management took the decision after nearly 250,000 people had visited the site since its opening since July 2009. [[ScottishPower]] Renewables said that nearly 10,000 pupils had so far visited Whitelee on school trips. In addition, at least "another 100,000 people had accessed the wind farm's 90km (56 miles) of trails for recreational purposes such as jogging and cycling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-18525763 |title= Whitelee Wind Farm joins major tourist attractions body |author= |date=20 June 2012  |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lochgoin Farm and Monument===
[[File:Lochgoin Monument - geograph.org.uk - 1499979.jpg|thumb|right|Lochgoin monument and farmhouse]]
The wind farm area includes Lochgoin Farm, the home of the Howie family which in the 17th century  was a noted refuge for [[Covenanter]]s, and was searched multiple times by government soldiers. In the 18th century [[John Howie (biographer)|John Howie]] became a biographer who recorded the lives of Covenanting martyrs in books published from 1775 onwards. In 1896 a stone [[obelisk]] was erected nearby as a monument "in memory of John Howie, author of the ''Scots Worthies''"; this is accessible by the tracks leading from the visitor centre. A small museum at the farm holds relics of Covenanters, check for opening arrangements.&lt;ref name="Canmore 1956"&gt;{{cite web | title=Lochgoin Farmhouse And Monument To John Howie | website=Canmore | date=1956-08-23 | url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/43786/lochgoin-farmhouse-and-monument-to-john-howie | accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="East Renfrewshire Council"&gt;{{cite web | title=Covenanters | website=East Renfrewshire Council | url=http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/whitelee-covenanters | accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensions==
Whitelee Windfarm currently has a 75 turbine extension under construction. This will add an additional 217 MW of capacity, enough to power the equivalent of over 124,000 homes. This will bring the total generating capacity of the wind farm up to 539 MW. Work on this new development commenced in November 2010, with the completion date extended from December 2012 to March 2013. Additionally, the new extension will add a further 44&amp;nbsp;km of trails to the site. 
John Sisk and Son Limited and Roadbridge were jointly appointed as Principal Contractors for the site during construction with Alstom Limited erecting and commissioning the wind turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPR Awards Whitelee Extension Contract|url=http://www.whiteleewindfarm.com/news/spr_awards_whitelee_extension_contract|work=Whitelee Wind Farm|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012 Scottish Power announced that it was applying for a further small extension of five turbines on the west of the existing site, adding 12 MW of capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-19211207 BBC News "Scottish Power wants Whitelee wind farm third extension"] Retrieved 2012-09-17&lt;/ref&gt; This was refused by the DPEA on 19 Oct 2016. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpea.scotland.gov.uk/CaseDetails.aspx?id=115381|title=Scottish Government - DPEA - Case Details|website=www.dpea.scotland.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents ==
On 19 March 2010 a blade snapped off a turbine which led to Whitelee wind farm being temporarily shut down while safety checks were completed on all other turbines on the site. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8582554.stm|title=BBC News - Blade snaps off huge wind turbine|website=news.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017 a turbine lost its nose cone, the entire site was closed until such time as the remaining turbines could be checked and tested. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra.co.uk/news/environment/wind-turbine-at-whiteleehill-farm-loses-a-nose-cone-1-4391662|title=Wind turbine at Whiteleehill farm loses a nose cone|website=www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2017 a worker fell from a turbine while it was undergoing maintenance, though that was not linked to his death. The Police are not treating his death as suspicious. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stv.tv/news/west-central/1384484-wind-farm-worker-dies-after-falling-from-360ft-turbine/|title=Wind farm worker dies after falling from turbine|website=STV News|language=en|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/windfarm-worker-plunges-death-turbine-10134003|title=Windfarm worker falls to his death from turbine near Glasgow|last=Ward|first=Paul|date=2017-03-31|work=dailyrecord|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women's empowerment'' is the procedure in which women elaborate and recreate what is that they can be, do, and accomplish in a circumstance that they previously were denied.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Kabeer, Naila. "Gender equality and women's empowerment: A critical analysis of the third millennium development goal 1." ''Gender &amp; Development'' 13.1 (2005): 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosedale|first=Sarah|date=2005-03-01|title=Assessing women's empowerment: towards a conceptual framework|journal=Journal of International Development|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=243–257|doi=10.1002/jid.1212|issn=1099-1328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it is the process for women to redefine gender roles that allows for them to acquire the ability to choose between known alternatives whom have otherwise been restricted from such an ability.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are several principles defining women's empowerment such as, for one to be empowered, they must come from a position of disempowerment. Furthermore, one must acquire empowerment themselves rather than have it given to them by an external party. Other studies have found that empowerment definitions entail people having the capability to make important decisions in their lives while also being able to act on them. Lastly, empowerment and disempowerment is relative to other  at a previous time; therefore, empowerment is a process, not a product.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

Women empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in [[Human development (humanity)|development]] and [[economics]]. It can also point to the approaches regarding other trivialized [[gender]]s in a particular political or social context.

Women's [[economic empowerment]] refers to the ability for women to enjoy their right to control and benefit from the 
resources, [[asset]]s, [[income]] and their own time, as well as the ability to [[Risk management|manage risk]] and improve their economic status and well being.&lt;ref name="Women's Economic Empowerment Conceptual Framework"&gt;Oxfam (Forthcoming), "Women's Economic Empowerment Conceptual Framework"&lt;/ref&gt;

While often interchangeably used, the more comprehensive concept of [[gender empowerment]] refers to people of any gender, stressing the [[Sex and gender distinction|distinction]] between biological  and [[Gender role|gender as a role]]. It thereby also refers to other marginalized genders in a

== Importance of women's empowerment in societies ==
Entire nations, businesses, communities and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/40248/1/IDL-40248.pdf|title=An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency|year=2009|editor2=Lila Shahani|publisher=Earthscan|location=Sterling, VA|editor1=Deneulin, Séverine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empowerment of women is a necessity for the very development of a society, since it enhances both the quality and the quantity of human resources available for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Kamla|last2=Yesudian|first2=P. Princy|date=2006|title=Evidence of women's empowerment in India: a study of socio-spatial disparities|url=|journal=GeoJournal|volume=65|issue=4|pages=365–380|doi=10.1007/s10708-006-7556-z|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empowerment]] is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights and development]].

== Methods ==
Scholars have identified two forms of empowerment, economic empowerment and political empowerment.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Kabeer, Naila. "Contextualising the Economic Pathways of Women's Empowerment: Findings from a Multi-Country Research Programme." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/democratic-governance/inclusive-political-institutions/regional-organizations--gender-equality-and-the-political-empowe.html|title=Regional Organizations, Gender Equality and the Political Empowerment of Women|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic empowerment ===
Economic empowerment increases women's agency, access to formal government programs, mobility outside the home, economic independence, and purchasing power. Policy makers are suggested to support job training to aid in entrance in the formal markets.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One recommendation is to provide more formal education opportunities for women that would allow for higher bargaining power in the home. They would have more access to higher wages outside the home; and as a result, make it easier for women to get a job in the market.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duflo|first=Esther|date=2012|title=Women Empowerment and Economic Development|jstor=23644911|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1051–1079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strengthening women's access to property inheritance and land rights is another method used to economically empower women. This would allow them better means of asset accumulation, capital, and [[bargaining power]] needed to address [[gender inequalities]]. Often, women in developing and underdeveloped nations are legally restricted from their land on the sole basis of gender.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; Having a right to their land gives women a sort of bargaining power that they wouldn't normally have; in turn, they gain more opportunities for economic independence and formal financial institutions.

Another popular methodology for women's economic empowerment also includes [[microcredit]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microfinance institutions aim to empower women in their community by giving them access to loans that have low interest rates without the requirement of collateral.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Geleta, Esayas Bekele. "Microfinance and the politics of empowerment: a critical cultural perspective." ''Journal of Asian and African Studies'' 49.4 (2014): 413-425.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, they aim to give microcredit to women who want to be entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The success and efficiency of microcredit and microloans is controversial and constantly debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Parmar, A.|year=2003|title=Microcredit, Empowerment, and Agency: Re-evaluating the Discourse|journal=Canadian Journal of Development Studies|volume=24|issue=3|pages=461–76|doi=10.1080/02255189.2003.9668932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critiques claim that microcredit alone doesn't guarantee women have control over the way it is used. Microfinance institutions don't address cultural barriers that allow men to still control household finances; as a result, microcredit may simply be transferred to the husband. Microcredit doesn't relieve women of household obligations, and even if women have credit, they don't have the time to be as active in the market as men.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Ellis, Amanda. ''Gender and economic growth in Kenya: Unleashing the power of women''. World Bank Publications, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political empowerment ===
Political empowerment supports creating policies that would best support gender equality and agency for women in both the public and private spheres. Popular methods that have been suggested are to create affirmative action policies that have a quota for the number of women in policy making and parliament positions.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; As of 2017, the global average of women whom hold lower and single house parliament positions is 23.6 percent.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Further recommendations have been to increase women's rights to [[vote]], voice opinions, and the ability to run for office with a fair chance of being elected.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt; Because women are typically associated with child care and domestic responsibilities in the home, they have less time dedicated to entering the labour market and running their business. Policies that increase their [[bargaining power]] in the household would include policies that account for cases of divorce, policies for better welfare for women, and policies that give women control over resources (such as property rights).&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; However, participation is not limited to the realm of politics. It can include participation in the [[household]], in schools, and the ability to make choices for oneself. Some theorists believe that bargaining power and agency in the household must to be achieved before one can move onto broader political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Human Development: The Capabilities to Approach|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9781139459358|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=1–33|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and assessment ==
Women empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM), which shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. GEM is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence".&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt;

Some critiques of GEM is that it is not concerned with factors regarding society, such as gender, religion, cultural context, legal context, and violations of women's rights.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Charmes, Jacques, and Saskia Wieringa. "Measuring women's empowerment: an assessment of the gender-related development index and the gender empowerment measure." ''Journal of Human Development'' 4.3 (2003): 419-435.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender empowerment measure attempts to makes a consistent standardized approach to measure women's empowerment; in doing so, it has been critiqued that the GEM doesn't account for variation in historical factors, female autonomy, gender segregation, and women's right to vote.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pillarisetti|first=J.|last2=McGillivray|first2=Mark|date=1998-06-01|title=Human Development and Gender Empowerment: Methodological and Measurement Issues|journal=Development Policy Review|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=197–203|doi=10.1111/1467-7679.00059|issn=1467-7679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) is a way in which the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) measures the inequality between genders within a country. Some critique of this measurement is that, because GDI calculations rely solely on the achievement distribution between males and females of a population, GDI doesn't measure gender inequality; rather, it measures absolute levels on income, education and health&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A more qualitative form of assessing women's empowerment is to identify constraints to action. This allows for the identification of power relations between genders. Because this is a participatory process, it facilitates conversation on gender discrimination.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Comparing constraints on women at a later time also allows for any changes or expansion to be better identified. The evaluation of the development of women's agency allows for an evaluation of actions taken. These assessments must also be based on the action taken by women, and not external groups. External groups can help facilitate women's empowerment, but cannot bestow it on them.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

== Barriers ==

Many of the barriers to women's empowerment and equity lie ingrained in cultural norms. Many women feel these pressures, while others have become accustomed to being treated inferior to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Culture, and Development: A Study of Human Capabilities|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1995|isbn=9780198289647|editor1=Martha C. Nussbaum|location=Oxford|pages=1–15|chapter=Introduction|editor2=Jonathan Glover|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if [[legislators]], [[NGOs]], etc. are aware of the benefits women's empowerment and participation can have, many are scared of disrupting the status of the women and continue to let [[societal norms]] get in the way of development.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that the increasing access to the internet can also result in an increased exploitation of women.&lt;ref name="Sutton, J. 2000" /&gt; Releasing personal information on websites has put some women's personal safety at risk. In 2010, Working to Halt Online Abuse stated that 73% of women were victimized through such sites. Types of victimization include [[cyber stalking]], harassment, [[online pornography]], and [[flaming (Internet)|flaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morahan-Martin, J.|year=2000|title=Women and the Internet: Promise and Perils|journal=Cyber Psychology &amp; Behavior|volume=3|issue=5|pages=683–691|doi=10.1089/10949310050191683}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual harassment]] in particular is a large barrier for women in the workplace. It appears in almost all industries, but is most notable in the following: business, trade, banking and finance, sales and marketing, hospitality, civil service, and education, lecturing and teaching.&lt;ref name="Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aware.org.sg/training/wsh-site/14-statistics/|title=Statistics|date=22 April 2010|work=AWARE RSS|publisher=AWARE|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), sexual harassment is a clear form of gender discrimination based on sex, a manifestation of unequal power relations between men and women. Furthermore, the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is urging for increased measures of protection for women against sexual harassment and violence in the workplace. 54% (272) had experienced some form of workplace sexual harassment. 79% of the victims are women; 21% were men.&lt;ref name="Statistics" /&gt;

Recent studies also show that women face more barriers in the workplace than do men. Gender-related barriers involve sexual harassment, unfair hiring practices, career progression, and unequal pay where women are paid less than men are for performing the same job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stein, A.I.|year=2009|title=Women Lawyers Blog for Workplace Equality: Blogging as a Feminist Legal Method|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287&amp;context=yjlf|journal=Yale Journal of Law and Feminism|volume=20|issue=2|pages=357–408}}&lt;/ref&gt; When taking the median earnings of men and women who worked full-time, year-round, government data from 2014 showed that women made $0.79 for every dollar a man earned. The average earnings for working mothers came out to even less—$0.71 for every dollar a father made, according to a 2014 study conducted by the National Partnership for Women and Children. While much of the public discussion of the "[[Gender pay gap|wage gap]]" has focused around women getting equal pay for the same work as their male peers, many women struggle with what is called the "pregnancy penalty". The main problem is that it is difficult to measure, but some experts say that the possibility of having a baby can be enough for employers to push women back from their line.&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/business/careers/motherhood-penalty-can-affect-women-who-never-even-have-child-n548511|title='Motherhood Penalty' Can Affect Women Who Never Even Have a Child|author=Safia Samee Ali|date=April 11, 2016|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women are put in a position where they need to make the decision of whether to maintain in the workforce or have children. This problem has sparked the debate over maternity leave in the United States.

However, despite the struggle for equal pay in the United States, the tech industry{{clarify|date=June 2017}} has made progress in helping to encourage equal pay across gender. In March 2016, tech career website Dice released a study of more than 16,000 tech professionals that found that when you compare equivalent education, experience and position, there is no pay gap—and hasn't been for the last six years.&lt;ref name="NBC" /&gt; This new industry is paving a way for other companies to do the same. However, this industry also struggles to employ women in executive positions. This is partially due to the barrier of sexual harassment and pregnancy that was aforementioned.

Such barriers make it difficult for women to advance in their workplace or receive fair compensation for the work they provide.

== Role of education ==
It is said that education increases "people's self-confidence and also enables them to find better jobs and they can work shoulder to shoulder with men".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marniemi|first=J.|last2=Parkki|first2=M. G.|date=1975-09-01|title=Radiochemical assay of glutathione S-epoxide transferase and its enhancement by phenobarbital in rat liver in vivo|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=24|issue=17|pages=1569–1572|issn=0006-2952|pmid=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They engage in public debate and make demands on government for health care, social security and other entitlements".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UNDP. 2013. Human Development Report. The Rise of the South. Human Progress in a Diverse World; New York, UNDP.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, education empowers women to make choices that improve their children's health, their well-being, and chances of survival.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2014. EFA Global Monitoring Report 2013/2014: Teaching and Learning, Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Education informs others of preventing and containing the disease, and it is an essential element of efforts to reduce malnutrition. Furthermore, it empowers women to make choices that can improve their welfare, including marrying beyond childhood and having fewer children. Crucially, education can increase women's awareness of their rights, boost their self-esteem, and provide them the opportunity to assert their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002343/234325E.pdf|title=Mobile phones and literacy: Empowerment in Women's Hands; A Cross-Case Analysis of Nine Experiences|last=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100123-9|location=33|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite significant improvements in recent decades, education is not universally available and gender inequalities persist. A major concern in many countries is not only the limited numbers of girls going to school but also the limited educational pathways for those that step into the classroom. More specifically, there should be more efforts to address the lower participation and learning achievement of [[Female education in STEM|girls in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cracking the code: girls' and women's education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=9789231002335|location=Paris|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Internet as a tool of empowerment ==

The growing access of the web in the late 20th century has allowed women to empower themselves by using various tools on the Internet. With the introduction of the [[World Wide Web]], women have begun to use social networking sites like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] for [[online activism]].&lt;ref name="Sutton, J. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sutton, J.|author2=Pollock, S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Online Activism for Women's Rights|journal=Cyber Psychology &amp; Behavior|volume=3|issue=5|pages=699–706|doi=10.1089/10949310050191700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through online activism, women are able to empower themselves by organizing campaigns and voicing their opinions for equality rights without feeling oppressed by members of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Churchyard, N.|year=2009|title=The Question of Empowerment: Women's Perspective on Their Internet Use|journal=[[Gender, Technology and Development]]|volume=13|issue=3|pages=341–363|doi=10.1177/097185241001300302}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on May 29, 2013, an online campaign started by 100 female advocates forced the leading social networking website, Facebook, to take down various pages that spread hatred about women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McVeigh, T.|date=June 6, 2013|title=Online Feminist activists of the digital age|work=Taipei Times|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2013/06/06/2003564076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[blogging]] has also become a powerful tool for the educational empowerment of women. According to a study done by the University of California, Los Angeles, medical patients who read and write about their disease are often in a much happier mood and more knowledgeable than those who do not.&lt;ref name="breastcancer.about.com"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephan, P.|date=August 13, 2013|title=Breast cancer patients blog their blues away|url=http://breastcancer.about.com/b/2013/08/13/blog-the-blues-away.htm|journal=Breastcancer.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By reading others' experiences, patients can better educate themselves and apply strategies that their fellow bloggers suggest.&lt;ref name="breastcancer.about.com"/&gt;

With the easy accessibility and affordability of [[e-learning]] (electronic learning), women can now study from the comfort of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Radovic-Markovic, M.|author2=Nelson-Porter, B.|author3=Omolaja, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=The new alternative women's entrepreneurship education: E-learning and virtual universities|journal=International Women Online Journal of Distance Education|volume=1|issue=2|pages=46–54|url=http://wojde.org/FileUpload/bs295854/File/06a.markovic.pdf|issn=2147-0367}}&lt;/ref&gt; By empowering themselves educationally through new technologies like e-learning, women are also learning new skills that will come in handy in today's advancing globalized world.

Often times, the internet is very useful as source of empowerment for women through its creation, dispersion, and utilization of hashtags on social media. One prime example of hashtags supporting women empowerment was in 2017 when the #AintNoCinderella hashtag came into existence. This hashtag spread like wildfire on social media after Varnika Kundu (a 29-year-old woman in India) was driving home past midnight on August 4 when she was followed and harassed by two men in a SUV{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Kundu was blamed for being out late at night, particularly by the BJP government Vice-President Ramveer Bhatti. This lead to women all across India and the world posting pictures of themselves out late at night with the hashtag "#AintNoCinderella" to show that women do not have a particular curfew to which they have to adhere to (like Cinderella did). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/ain-t-no-cinderella-women-hit-out-bjp-leader-blaming-chandigarh-stalking-victim-66456|title=Ain’t no Cinderella: Women hit out at BJP leader for blaming Chandigarh stalking victim|date=2017-08-08|work=The News Minute|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ongoing projects ==
The UN came out with a set of goals called the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, to help make the world a better place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable development goals - United Nations|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 17, the fourth goal works to allow access to education for all people alike. A large effort has been made to include women in schools to better their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/|title=Education - United Nations Sustainable Development|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the fifth goal focuses on empowering women and girls to achieve gender equality through equal access to various types of opportunities (health care, education, work, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some prominent non-profits that help empower women:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thepowerofpurpose.com/10-amazing-nonprofits-empowering-women-2017/|title=10 Amazing Nonprofits Empowering Women in 2017 - The Power of Purpose|date=2017-01-26|work=The Power of Purpose|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. involvement ===
[[File:First Lady Melania Trump and Under Secretary Shannon Pose for a Photo With the 2017 International Women of Courage Awardees (33338548780).jpg|thumb|[[Melania Trump]] with 2017 [[International Women of Courage Award]]ees]]
Domestically, the U.S. empowered women through passings of laws such as allowing women to vote in 1920, banning discrimination based on gender in 1964, banning discrimination against pregnant women in 1978, etc. Additionally, the inclusion of women in politics allowed for more gender equality. The first female speaker of House, the first First Lady to run for president, and first women to serve on the Supreme Court were monumental events that proved socially the acceptance of "subservient" women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwhp.org/resources/womens-rights-movement/detailed-timeline/|title=Detailed Timeline {{!}} National Women's History Project|website=www.nwhp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. provides foreign aid to third world countries in various forms, one of which is by providing education programs. There are currently bills in Congress that work to ensure education to girls, one of which is the Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act. These are enacted with the belief that proper education will pull them out of poverty and reduce exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2408|title=H.R.2408 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act|last=Steve|first=Chabot|date=2017-10-04|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another action taken on by the U.S is the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|PEPFAR]] program, initiated by the Bush administration in 2003. The U.S. spent more than $1.4 billion in funding sub-Saharan Africa during the duration of the program. This program was taken into effect in response to the global HIV/AIDS crisis, and it promoted abstinence among young girls and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Jon|date=June 15, 2007|title=Bush Boosts AIDS Relief: Cause for Applause and Pause|jstor=20036459|journal=Science|volume=316|issue=5831|pages=1552|pmid=17569832|doi=10.1126/science.316.5831.1552}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a partnership with DREAMS, and its main purpose with PEPFAR was to allow both girls and women to develop into Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pepfar.gov/partnerships/ppp/dreams/|title=Working Together for an AIDS-Free Future for Girls and Women|website=www.pepfar.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are criticisms that this program did not really do much to reduce HIV risk behavior, and critics such as John Dietrich worried that the context of aid enforced Western beliefs of choosing abstinence before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendavid|first=Eran, et al.|date=May 2016|title=Abstinence Funding Was Not Associated With Reductions In HIV Risk Behavior In Sub-Saharan Africa|url=|journal=Health Affairs|volume=35|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/05/03/476601108/u-s-spent-1-4-billion-to-stop-hiv-by-promoting-abstinence-did-it-work|title=U.S. Spent $1.4 Billion To Stop HIV By Promoting Abstinence. Did It Work?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was and still is controversy regarding the effectiveness of this program in reducing HIV/AIDS through advocating abstinence and whether this would actually empower women in Africa.
