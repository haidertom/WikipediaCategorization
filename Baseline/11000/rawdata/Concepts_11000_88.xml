      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14988">An '''address confidentiality program''' allows victims of [[domestic violence]], [[sexual assault]], [[stalking]] or other types of crime to receive mail at a [[confidential]] address, while keeping their actual address undisclosed. This is usually done through the state's [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State's]] address or some other address which will legally substitute the agency's address for the victim's physical address on public records.

According to the [[National Network to End Domestic Violence]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;Address Confidentiality Programs (ACP) and Confidential Voter Listings are programs administered by the state enabling victims of domestic violence (and sometime victims of sexual assault and/or stalking) to participate in the voting process without fear of being found by their abusers. ACPs generally provide a substitute address for all public records. Confidential Voter Listings only provide confidentiality on election-related public records.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Bank Accounts and Address Confidentiality==
The rules implementing the [[Bank Secrecy Act]] require a financial institution to implement a [[Customer Identification Program]] that includes procedures that enable it to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its customers. The rules also require that a financial institution obtain a residential or business street address from each customer. Unfortunately, the substitute address under an Address Confidentiality Program does not meet the standards.

The [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] issued a letter ruling to help the situation. The [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] regulations also allow: "If the individual customer does not have a residential or business street address, then the rules permit the individual customer to provide a "residential or business street address of next of kin or of another contact individual."

In FIN-2009-R003, the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] found: "A customer who participates in a state-created ACP shall be treated as not having a residential or business street address and a secretary of state, or other state entity serving as a designated agent of the customer consistent with the terms of the ACP, will act as another contact individual for the purpose of complying with FinCEN's rules. Therefore, a financial institution should collect the street address of the ACP sponsoring agency for purposes of meeting its CIP address requirement."

'''''Aegyo''''' ({{korean|hangul=애교|hanja=愛嬌}}) in [[Korean language|Korean]] refers to a cute display of affection often expressed including but not limited to through a cute/baby voice, facial expressions, and gestures.&lt;ref name="Jung2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sun Jung|title=Korean Masculinities and Transcultural Consumption: Yonsama, Rain, Oldboy, K-Pop Idols|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npgE-K9rawUC&amp;pg=PA165|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-988-8028-66-5|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aegyo'' literally means behaving in a flirtatious, [[Flirting|coquette-ish]] manner and it is commonly expected for both male and female [[Korean pop idol|k-pop idol]]s&lt;ref name="UtzLau2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christian Utz|author2=Frederick Lau|title=Vocal Music and Contemporary Identities: Unlimited Voices in East Asia and the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GblVHStg54oC&amp;pg=PA279|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-50224-5|pages=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; to behave this way. However, it is not uncommon for everyday people to behave in such a way, and is widely used as an expression of affection to loved ones, families, and friends. ''Aegyo'' can also display closeness with others, which can possibly bring people together. The word is often translated as [[cuteness]] in English{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and can be compared to the Japanese concept of [[kawaii]] or to the Japanese equivalent, {{nihongo|''aikyou''|愛嬌, あいきょう}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Background==
''Aegyo'' plays a huge role in [[South Korean popular culture]], especially in idol girl groups. The higher-registered girl voice popular in girl groups in Korea has been dominant since the first successful female k-pop group [[S.E.S. (band)|S.E.S.]] emerged in 1997. This style has grown in popularity since then. A famous example of that exaggerated cuteness that is ''aegyo'' is the [[Girls' Generation]] music video for "[[Gee (Girls' Generation song)|Gee]]", which features much use of hands pointing at, touching and framing the face when showing the girls in turn. The first of their many song &amp; dance videos, many of Gee's dance moves are based on aegyo. ''Aegyo'' as a personal trait of Girls' Generation member [[Sunny (singer)|Sunny]] was described as "cuteness that calls for a punch," not as an actual complaint, but as a recognition of the degree to which ''aegyo'' can be taken. 

Although more common among female idol groups, male groups often perform ''aegyo'' as part of their fanservice. The ''[[maknae]]'', or youngest member of a group, is often (but not exclusively) the one encouraged to perform ''aegyo''. Another member may get a better response from fans, or be better suited due to physical or emotional characteristics. For some performers, ''aegyo'' is merely an extension of their own normal behavior, encouraged by the groups' producers. 

As performers evolve from "atul" to "young adult" images, the ''aegyo'' in their performances often evolves, becoming an almost-nostalgic homage to the performers' earlier stage image. They will "put on the character" briefly for fun and to satisfy fan expectation, in the same way they will sing their earliest hits. Some traces of ''aegyo'' will continue as persistent traits.

A pro-forma version of ''aegyo'' may become tradition for certain circumstances, such as when idols perform the "[[Gwiyomi]]" song, with actions made popular by the South Korean rapper Jung Ilhoon of [[BtoB (band)|BtoB]].

Puzar argues that ''aegyo'' in popular culture affects how young South Korean women act, especially in romantic relationships. Using cute hand gestures and expressions in photos, for example, are commonly seen behaviors in many young women in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Puzar, Aljosa. “Asian Dolls and the Western Gaze: Notes on the Female Dollification in South Korea,” ''Asian Women'' 27.2 (2011): 81-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aram Bartholl''' (born December 27, 1972 in Bremen, Germany) is a [[Berlin]]-based conceptual artist known for his examination of the relationship between the digital and physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/world-137550-bartholl-laguna.html |title='World of Warcraft' exhibit may raise some brows |date=9 July 2009 |author=Chris Caeser |publisher=The Orange County Register |accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works often deal with anonymity and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dead Drops: what to do if you see a USB stick sticking out of a wall|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2015/mar/08/dead-drops-what-to-do-if-you-see-a-usb-stick-sticking-out-of-a-wall|accessdate=13 December 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heddaya|first1=Mostafa|title=Kill Your Phone: Artist Targets Surveillance|url=http://hyperallergic.com/107834/kill-your-phone-artist-targets-surveillance/|website=Hyperallergic|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Aram Bartholl graduated from [[Berlin University of the Arts]] in 2001 with an [[Engineer's degree#Germany and Austria|engineer's degree]] in architecture. His graduate thesis "Bits on Location" won the 2001 Browserday competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dauerer|first1=Verena|title=Wenn der Gullydeckel piept|url=http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2001/12/06/a0161|accessdate=6 January 2017|publisher=TAZ|date=6 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Bartholl's studies, he held a nine-month internship position at the Rotterdam-based architecture office [[MVRDV]]. From 1996 to 2000, Bartholl was part of the artist group "Freies Fach" which was known for its discourse on urban matters and for its public interventions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarchitektur.com/jetztundzehn/biographie/bigness.html Biographie 'Freies Fach']&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the Internet-based Free Art and Technology Lab a.k.a.

== Notable Works ==

===Keepalive===
''Keepalive'' is a permanent outdoor sculpture in Niedersachsen, Germany, commissioned by the Center for Digital Cultures, Leuphana University Lüneburg. The title, Keepalive, refers to the keepalive signal, a message – often sent at predetermined intervals – that is used on networks to check the link between two devices, to make a diagnosis or to indicate to the internet infrastructure that the connection should be preserved. Domenico Quaranta described the work as generating, "...a fiction that ironically locates it in a post-apocalyptic, cyberpunk scenario where humanity has been “kept alive”, the internet is over and power is provided by fire, but also where technologies and pieces of information have survived as digital junk. Presented as an artwork and preserved as such, it may once turn useful and even essential for a wandering Mad Max to survive, as the only remaining access point to basic information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=QUARANTA|first1=DOMENICO|title=Oh, When the Internet Breaks at Some Point|url=https://mefsite.wordpress.com/2016/05/12/domenico-quaranta-oh-when-the-internet-breaks-at-some-point/|website=MEDIA IN THE EXPANDED FIELD Site|publisher=Montabonel &amp; Partners|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dead Drops===
[[File:Dead Drops by Aram Bartholl sthemessage in Kunstenlab (6636685395).jpg|thumb|Dead Drops]]
Bartholl's ongoing [[USB dead drop|Dead Drops]] project, started in 2010, set up an offline peer-to-peer file-sharing network at five public locations in New York using [[Dead Drop (USB)|dead drops]]: USB sticks cemented into walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1326177/Dead-Drops-Bizarre-new-artwork-embeds-USB-sticks-buildings.html|title=Dead Drops: Bizarre new artwork embeds USB sticks in buildings   |date=3 November 2010|work=[[Mail Online]]|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has expanded exponentially around the world—over 1,400 of them have been placed in dozens of countries, including South Africa, Ghana, Germany, Iran and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markowitz|first1=Eric|title=The Odd World Of USB "Dead Drops"|url=http://www.vocativ.com/tech/internet/odd-world-usb-dead-drops/|website=vocativ|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dead Drops concept was extended in 2013 with the ''DVD Dead Drop'' installation at the [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)]].  Bartholl embedded an inconspicuous, slot-loading DVD burner into the side of the Museum, available to the public 24 hours a day. Visitors who found the Dead Drop and inserted a blank DVD-R received a digital art exhibition, a collection of media, or other featured content curated by Bartholl or selected artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steinhauer|first1=Jillian|title=Somewhere Between Cyber and Real: An Interview with Aram Bartholl|url=http://hyperallergic.com/55777/somewhere-between-cyber-and-real-an-interview-with-aram-bartholl/|website=Hyperallergic|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Dead Drops was included in the "Talk to Me" show at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.

===Map===
[[File:Map by Aram Bartholl at the show Hello World, Kasseler Kunstverein2013.jpg|thumb|Map by Aram Bartholl at the show Hello World, Kasseler Kunstverein2013]]

In 2006, Bartholl created a public art installation called Map. Bartholl installs a large physical representation of the [[Google Maps pin]] in the exact location that Google Maps identifies as the centre of a city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goethe.de/ins/ee/prj/gtw/aus/wer/bar/enindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creative.arte.tv/fr/community/map-2006-2010 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216102953/http://creative.arte.tv/fr/community/map-2006-2010 |archivedate=2014-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Locations thus far have included [[Taipei]], [[Berlin]], [[Arles]], [[Tallinn]] and [[Kassel]]. Each sculpture remains in place for about three months, usually coinciding with a local art festival or exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;http://datenform.de/blog/tag/map/&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was designed to raise viewers' awareness of the increasing overlap between the virtual and the physical, and to highlight mapping services' influence on perceptions of location. Bartholl's physical representations of the Google Maps pin urges viewers to reevaluate the information given by digitized maps, the meaning of the “center” of a city, the politicization of boundaries, and other issues related to maps and the digital versus the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.datenform.de/mapeng.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==

Bartholl's work has been shown internationally in solo and group exhibitions.

He is one of the artists selected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=dpa|title="Skulptur Projekte" greift erstmals Digitalisierung auf|url=http://www.monopol-magazin.de/skulptur-projekte-greift-erstmals-digitalisierung-auf|website=monopol magazine|publisher=monopol|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the 5th [[Skulptur Projekte Münster]] in 2017, a once every ten years exhibition curated by [[Kasper König]] that has previously featured artists such as Naim Jun Paik, Mike Kelly, Rachael Whiteread, Mark Wallinger and Rosemarie Trockel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6959">[[Image:Beuys+Furlong 1985.jpg|right|thumb|Bill Furlong interviewing [[Joseph Beuys]] in 1985]]
'''''Audio Arts''''' was a British sound magazine published on [[audio cassettes]], documenting contemporary artistic activity via artist or curator interviews, sound performances or sound art by artists.

==History==
The project was launched in 1973 by [[Barry Barker]] and British sculptor William Furlong, born 1944 in Woking, Great Britain. From 1973 to 2006, Audio Arts published 25 volumes of 4 issues of the Audio Arts Cassettes (later releasing LPs and CDs as well). Furlong conducted all interviews until 1996, when Jean Wainwright took the baton as interviewer. Each interview starts with ''I am here with...'', stating artist's name and recording location. Interviewees include: [[Andy Warhol]], [[Anish Kapoor]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Gilbert &amp; George]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], [[Hermann Nitsch]], [[Mario Merz]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Nam June Paik]], as well as an interview with [[WB Yeats]]' daughter and readings by Yeats himself (in Vol.1 Issue #4, 1974).

William Furlong was part of a generation of British artists of the 1960s-70s including [[Gilbert &amp; George]], [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Bruce McLean]] or [[Paul Richards (artist)|Paul Richards]] (whose Nice Style performance group was the first pose band) who were consciously moving from traditional art forms to conceptual art, performance, new media, cheap materials, in a dematerialized and process-oriented ethos.&lt;ref&gt;Information from Heidi Grundmann's essay featured in the ''See This Sound (Promises in Sound and Vision)'' catalogue published by Verlag der Buchhandlung Walther König, Köln, Germany, 2009. Catalogue supervised by Cosima Rainer, Stella Rollig, Dieter Daniels and Manuela Ammer.&lt;/ref&gt; Furlong is now a sound artist with sound installations exhibited in Lisbon (''Walls of Sound'', 1998), Bexhill on Sea, Sussex (''Anthem'', 2009), Genillard Gallery, London (''Possibility &amp; Impossibility of Fixing Meaning'', 2009).

[[Image:Audio-Arts-vol16 3&amp;4.jpg|right|thumb|Cover for Audio Arts cassette Vol. 16 #3-4,]]
With the acquisition of the Audio Arts archive by [[Tate]] in 2004 (itself a long-time subscriber to Audio Arts cassettes releases),
over 200 boxes of master tapes used to edit the magazine are now secured for future researchers. A selection was [http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/audioarts/ exhibited] at Tate Britain March–August 2007. The archive is now catalogued, digitized&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tate.org.uk/audio-arts/&lt;/ref&gt; and preserved there.&lt;ref name="Maynard"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Maynard |first= Jack |authorlink= |author2=Foster, Alison |date= 2012-10-01|title=Preserving the Audio Arts Archive |journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies |volume= 10 |issue= 1 |pages= 59–63 |id= |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5334/jcms.1011209 |doi=10.5334/jcms.1011209|pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October–December 2006, a retrospective exhibition curated by Lucia Farinati took place at Rome’s [https://web.archive.org/web/20080921031228/http://www.soundartmuseum.net/ Sound Art Museum] showing a selection of Audio Arts releases and adding a new sound art by Furlong: ''Conversation Pieces'', a reworking/remixing of preview Furlong interviews, making famous interviewees respond to each other by the magic of cut-up. See 
[http://www.slashseconds.org/issues/001/004/articles/wfurlong/index.php/ SlashSeconds.org].

William Furlong's Audio Arts project was featured in the ''See This Sound (Promises in Sound and Vision)'' exhibition, curated by Cosima Rainer, August 28, 2009 to January 10, 2010, Lentos Kunstmuseum, Linz, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;See official [http://beta.see-this-sound.at/ website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The cassette medium==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:AAcassette collection.jpg|right|thumb|Audio Arts cassettes display {{puic|AAcassette collection.jpg|2010 February 21}}]] --&gt;
Like other audio magazine publishers,&lt;ref&gt;Like [[Joseph Nechvatal]]'s [[Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine]] or [[Tina Pearson]]'s Musicworks cassettes&lt;/ref&gt; William Furlong took full advantage of the cassette medium as the most efficient way to spread his material the world over. The cassette was indeed the most pertinent medium for various reasons:
* easy copy on demand and cheap postage reduced production costs ;
* Furlong considered lengthy interviews as an equivalent to conceptual art and language-based art ;
* Furlong considered the cassette as an 'organic sculpture' in itself.

Some of the interviewees were themselves great defenders of the cassette medium, like [[Lawrence Weiner]] and [[Dieter Roth]]. In an interview with Ilari Valbonesi, Furlong says he considered the cassette medium as a radical form of communication back in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecopolis.org/embodying-sound-an-interview-with-bill-furlong-audio-arts/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515194914/http://www.ecopolis.org/embodying-sound-an-interview-with-bill-furlong-audio-arts/ |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; What he means by ''radical'' can be figured out from this Jean Wainwright recollection: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I am reminded of [[Vito Acconci]]'s work ''Face Off'' (1973) where he listens attentively to his own-recorded voice on an audio tape player telling of extremely intimate moments in his life. When the confessional material becomes too highly charged for him he cries out over the taped voice, 'no don't tell this, don't reveal this,' his dramatic response to his conflicting drives between self-revelation and self-concealment."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axisweb.org/dlFULL.aspx?ESSAYID=40/{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25501">In mathematics, the '''base change theorems''' relate the [[Direct image functor|direct image]] and the [[Pullback (category theory)|pull-back]] of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]]. More precisely, they are about the base change map, given by the following [[natural transformation]] of sheaves:

:&lt;math&gt;g^*(R^r f_* \mathcal{F}) \to R^r f'_*(g'^*\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl} X' &amp; \stackrel{g'}\to &amp; X \\
f' \downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow f \\
S' &amp; \stackrel g \to &amp; S \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[Cartesian square (category theory)|Cartesian square]] of topological spaces and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a sheaf on ''X''.

Such theorems exist in different branches of geometry: for (essentially arbitrary) topological spaces and proper maps ''f'', in [[algebraic geometry]] for (quasi-)coherent sheaves and ''f'' proper or ''g'' flat, similarly in [[analytic geometry]], but also for [[étale sheaf|étale sheaves]] for ''f'' proper or ''g'' smooth.

== Introduction ==
A simple base change phenomenon arises in [[commutative algebra]] when ''A'' is a [[commutative ring]] and ''B'' and ''A' ''are two ''A''-algebras. Let &lt;math&gt;B' = B \otimes_A A'&lt;/math&gt;. In this situation, given a ''B''-module ''M'', there is an isomorphism (of ''A' ''-modules):

:&lt;math&gt;(M \otimes_B B')_{A'} \cong (M_A) \otimes_A A'.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the subscript indicates the forgetful functor, i.e., &lt;math&gt;M_A&lt;/math&gt; is ''M'', but regarded as an ''A''-module.
Indeed, such an isomorphism is obtained by observing 

:&lt;math&gt;M \otimes_B B' = M \otimes_B B \otimes_A A' \cong M \otimes_A A'.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the two operations, namely forgetful functors and tensor products commute in the sense of the above isomorphism.
The base change theorems discussed below are statements of a similar kind.

== Definition of the base change map ==
{{Images of sheaves}}
The base change theorems presented below all assert that (for different types of sheaves, and under various assumptions on the maps involved), that the following ''base change map''

:&lt;math&gt;g^*(R^r f_* \mathcal{F}) \to R^r f'_*(g'^*\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;

is an isomorphism, where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl} X' &amp; \stackrel{g'}\to &amp; X \\
f' \downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow f \\
S' &amp; \stackrel g \to &amp; S\\ \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

are continuous maps between topological spaces that form a [[Cartesian square (category theory)|Cartesian square]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a sheaf on ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;
The roles of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; are symmetric, and in some contexts (especially smooth base change) the more familiar formulation is the other one (dealing instead with the map &lt;math&gt;f^* R^i g_* \mathcal G \rightarrow R^i g'_* f'^* \mathcal G&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal G&lt;/math&gt; a sheaf on &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt;). For consistency, the results in this article below are all stated for the '''same''' situation, namely the map &lt;math&gt;g^* R^i f_* \mathcal F \rightarrow R^i f'_* g'^* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;; but readers should be sure to check this against their expectations.&lt;/ref&gt; Here &lt;math&gt;R^i f_* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[higher direct image]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; under ''f'', i.e., the [[derived functor]] of the direct image (also known as pushforward) functor &lt;math&gt;f_*&lt;/math&gt;.

This map exists without any assumptions on the maps ''f'' and ''g''. It is constructed as follows: since &lt;math&gt;g'^*&lt;/math&gt; is [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] to &lt;math&gt;g'_*&lt;/math&gt;, there is a natural map (called unit map)
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id} \to g'_* \circ g'^*&lt;/math&gt;
and so 

:&lt;math&gt;R^r f_* \to R^r f_* \circ g'_* \circ g'^*.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Grothendieck spectral sequence]] then gives the first map and the last map (they are edge maps) in:

:&lt;math&gt;R^r f_* \circ g'_* \circ g'^* \to R^r(f \circ g')_* \circ g'^* = R^r(g \circ f')_* \circ g'^* \to g_* \circ R^r f'_* \circ g'^*.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining this with the above yields

:&lt;math&gt;R^r f_* \to g_* \circ R^r f'_* \circ g'^*.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the adjointness of &lt;math&gt;g^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_*&lt;/math&gt; finally yields the desired map.

The above-mentioned introductory example is a special case of this, namely for the [[affine spectrum|affine spectra]] &lt;math&gt;X = \operatorname{Spec} (B), S = \operatorname{Spec} (A), S' = \operatorname{Spec} (A')&lt;/math&gt; and, consequently, &lt;math&gt;X' = \operatorname{Spec} (B')&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[quasi-coherent sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F := \tilde M&lt;/math&gt; associated to the ''B''-module ''M''.

It is conceptually convenient to organize the above base change maps, which only involve only a single higher direct image functor, into one which encodes all &lt;math&gt;R^r f_*&lt;/math&gt; at a time. In fact, similar arguments as above yield a map in the [[derived category]] of sheaves on ''S':''

:&lt;math&gt;g^* Rf_* (\mathcal{F}) \to Rf'_*(g'^*\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Rf_*&lt;/math&gt; denotes the (total) derived functor of &lt;math&gt;f_*&lt;/math&gt;.

== General topology ==
===Proper base change===
If ''X'' is a [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological space]], ''S'' is a [[locally compact space|locally compact]] Hausdorff space and ''f'' is universally closed (i.e., &lt;math&gt;X \times_S T \to T&lt;/math&gt; is a [[closed map]] for any continuous map &lt;math&gt;T \to S&lt;/math&gt;), then
the base change map

:&lt;math&gt;g^* R^r f_* \mathcal F \to R^r f'_* g'^* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;

is an isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Milne|2012|loc=Theorem 17.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, we have: for &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;(R^r f_* \mathcal{F})_s = \varinjlim H^r(U, \mathcal{F}) = H^r(X_s, \mathcal{F}), \quad X_s = f^{-1}(s)&lt;/math&gt;

and so for &lt;math&gt;s = g(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g^* (R^r f_* \mathcal{F})_t = H^r(X_s, \mathcal{F}) = H^r(X'_t, g'^* \mathcal{F}) = R^r f'_* (g'^* \mathcal{F})_t.&lt;/math&gt;

To encode all individual higher derived functors of &lt;math&gt;f_*&lt;/math&gt; into one entity, the above statement may equivalently be rephrased by saying that the base change map

:&lt;math&gt;g^* Rf_* \mathcal F \to Rf'_* g'^* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[quasi-isomorphism]].

The assumptions that the involved spaces be Hausdorff have been weakened by {{harvtxt|Schnürer|Soergel|2016}}.

{{harvtxt|Lurie|2009}} has extended the above theorem to [[non-abelian cohomology|non-abelian sheaf cohomology]], i.e., sheaves taking values in [[simplicial set]]s (as opposed to abelian groups).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lurie|2009|loc=Theorem 7.3.1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct image with compact support===
If the map ''f'' is not closed, the base change map need not be an isomorphism, as the following example shows (the maps are the standard inclusions) :

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}
\emptyset &amp; \stackrel {g'} \to &amp; \mathbb C \setminus \{0\} \\
f' \downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow f \\
\{0\} &amp; \stackrel g \to &amp; \mathbb C
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

One the one hand &lt;math&gt;f'_* g'^* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is always zero, but if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is a [[local system]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C \setminus \{0\}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to a [[Group representation|representation]] of the [[fundamental group]] &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X)&lt;/math&gt; (which is isomorphic to '''Z'''), then &lt;math&gt;g^* f_* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; can be computed as the [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]s of the [[monodromy]] action of &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X, x)&lt;/math&gt; on the [[stalk (sheaf)|stalk]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F_x&lt;/math&gt; (for any &lt;math&gt;x \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;), which need not vanish.

To obtain a base-change result, the functor &lt;math&gt;f_*&lt;/math&gt; (or its derived functor) has to be replaced by the [[direct image with compact support]] &lt;math&gt;Rf_!&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if &lt;math&gt;f: X \to S&lt;/math&gt; is the inclusion of an open subset, such as in the above example, &lt;math&gt;Rf_! \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is the extension by zero, i.e., its stalks are given by

:&lt;math&gt;(Rf_! \mathcal F)_s = \begin{cases} \mathcal F_s &amp; s \in X, \\ 0 &amp; s \notin X. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

In general, there is a map &lt;math&gt;Rf_! \mathcal F \to Rf_* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;, which is a quasi-isomorphism if ''f'' is proper, but not in general. The proper base change theorem mentioned above has the following generalization: there is a quasi-isomorphism&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Iversen|1986}}, the four spaces are assumed to be [[locally compact]] and of finite dimension.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g^* Rf_! \mathcal F \to Rf'_! g'^* \mathcal F.&lt;/math&gt;

==Base change for quasi-coherent sheaves==

===Proper base change===
''Proper base change theorems'' for [[quasi-coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent sheaves]] apply in the following situation: &lt;math&gt;f: X \to S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[proper morphism]] between [[noetherian scheme]]s, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[coherent sheaf]] which is [[flat morphism|flat]] over ''S'' (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F_x&lt;/math&gt; is [[flat module|flat]] over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O_{S, f(x)}&lt;/math&gt;). In this situation, the following statements hold:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1963|loc=Section 7.7}}, {{harvtxt|Hartshorne|1977|loc=Theorem III.12.11}}, {{harvtxt|Vakil|2015|loc=Chapter 28 ''Cohomology and base change theorems''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Semicontinuity theorem":
** For each &lt;math&gt;p \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;s \mapsto \dim_{k(s)} H^p (X_s, \mathcal{F}_s): S \to \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is upper [[semicontinuous]].
** The function &lt;math&gt;s \mapsto \chi(\mathcal{F}_s)&lt;/math&gt; is locally constant, where &lt;math&gt;\chi(\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Euler characteristic]].
* If ''S'' is reduced and connected, then for each &lt;math&gt;p \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; the following are equivalent
**&lt;math&gt;s \mapsto \dim_{k(s)} H^p (X_s, \mathcal{F}_s)&lt;/math&gt; is constant.
** &lt;math&gt;R^p f_* \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is locally free and the natural map
::&lt;math&gt;R^p f_* \mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_S} k(s) \to H^p(X_s, \mathcal{F}_s)&lt;/math&gt;
:is an isomorphism for all &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;.
:Furthermore, if these conditions hold, then the natural map
::&lt;math&gt;R^{p-1} f_* \mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_S} k(s) \to H^{p-1}(X_s, \mathcal{F}_s)&lt;/math&gt;
:is an isomorphism for all &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;.
* If, for some ''p'', &lt;math&gt;H^p(X_s, \mathcal{F}_s) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;, then the natural map
::&lt;math&gt;R^{p-1} f_* \mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_S} k(s) \to H^{p-1}(X_s, \mathcal{F}_s)&lt;/math&gt;
:is an isomorphism for all &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;.

As the [[stalk (mathematics)|stalk]] of the sheaf &lt;math&gt;R^p f_* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is closely related to the cohomology of the fiber of the point under ''f'', this statement is paraphrased by saying that "cohomology commutes with base extension".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt | Hartshorne | 1977 | p=255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These statements are proved using the following fact, where in addition to the above assumptions &lt;math&gt;S = \operatorname{Spec} A&lt;/math&gt;: there is a finite complex &lt;math&gt;0 \to K^0 \to K^1 \to \cdots \to K^n \to 0&lt;/math&gt; of [[finitely generated projective module|finitely generated projective ''A''-modules]] and a natural isomorphism of functors
:&lt;math&gt;H^p(X \times_S \operatorname{Spec} -, \mathcal{F} \otimes_A -) \to H^p(K^\bullet \otimes_A -), p \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
on the category of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-algebras.

===Flat base change===
The base change map
:&lt;math&gt;g^*(R^r f_* \mathcal{F}) \to R^r f'_*(g'^*\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;
is an isomorphism for a [[quasi-coherent sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; (on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;), provided that the map &lt;math&gt;g: S' \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; is ''[[flat morphism|flat]]'' (together with a number of technical conditions: ''f'' needs to be a [[separated morphism|separated]] [[morphism of finite type]], the schemes involved need to be Noetherian).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hartshorne|1977|loc=Proposition III.9.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flat base change in the derived category====
A far reaching extension of flat base change is possible when considering the base change map
:&lt;math&gt;Lg^* Rf_* (\mathcal{F}) \to Rf'_*(Lg'^*\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;
in the derived category of sheaves on ''S','' similarly as mentioned above. Here &lt;math&gt;Lg^*&lt;/math&gt; is the (total) derived functor of the pullback of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt;-modules (because &lt;math&gt;g^* \mathcal G = \mathcal O_X \otimes_{g^{-1} \mathcal O_S} g^{-1} \mathcal G&lt;/math&gt; involves a tensor product, &lt;math&gt;g^*&lt;/math&gt; is not exact when {{math|''g''}} is not flat and therefore is not equal to its derived functor &lt;math&gt;Lg^*&lt;/math&gt;).
This map is a quasi-isomorphism provided that the following conditions are satisfied:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Berthelot|Grothendieck|Illusie|1971|loc=SGA 6 IV, Proposition 3.1.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is quasi-compact and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is quasi-compact and quasi-separated,
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is an object in &lt;math&gt;D^b(\mathcal{O}_X\text{-mod})&lt;/math&gt;, the bounded derived category of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt;-modules, and its cohomology sheaves are quasi-coherent (for example, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; could be a bounded complex of quasi-coherent sheaves)
* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; are ''Tor-independent'' over &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that if &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s' \in S'&lt;/math&gt; satisfy &lt;math&gt;f(x) = s = g(s')&lt;/math&gt;, then for all integers &lt;math&gt;p \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tor}^p_{\mathcal{O}_{S,s}}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x}, \mathcal{O}_{S',s'}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* One of the following conditions is satisfied:
** &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; has finite flat amplitude relative to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that it is quasi-isomorphic in &lt;math&gt;D^-(f^{-1}\mathcal O_S\text{-mod})&lt;/math&gt; to a complex &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal F')^i&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\mathcal O_S&lt;/math&gt;-flat for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; outside some bounded interval &lt;math&gt;[m, n]&lt;/math&gt;; equivalently, there exists an interval &lt;math&gt;[m, n]&lt;/math&gt; such that for any complex &lt;math&gt;\mathcal G&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;D^-(f^{-1}\mathcal O_S\text{-mod})&lt;/math&gt;, one has &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tor}_i(\mathcal F, \mathcal G) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; outside &lt;math&gt;[m, n]&lt;/math&gt;; or
** &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has finite Tor-dimension, meaning that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_{S'}&lt;/math&gt; has finite flat amplitude relative to &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

One advantage of this formulation is that the flatness hypothesis has been weakened.  However, making concrete computations of the cohomology of the left- and right-hand sides now requires the [[Grothendieck spectral sequence]].

===Base change in derived algebraic geometry===
[[Derived algebraic geometry]] provides a means to drop the flatness assumption, provided that the pullback &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the [[homotopy pullback]]. In the easiest case when ''X'', ''S'', and &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; are affine (with the notation as above), the homotopy pullback is given by the [[derived functor|derived]] tensor product
:&lt;math&gt;X' = \operatorname{Spec} (B' \otimes^L_B A)&lt;/math&gt;
Then, assuming that the schemes (or, more generally, derived schemes) involved are quasi-compact and quasi-separated, the natural transformation
:&lt;math&gt;L g^* R f_* \mathcal{F} \to Rf'_* Lg'^* \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;
is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] for any quasi-coherent sheaf, or more generally a [[chain complex|complex]] of quasi-coherent sheaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Toën|2012|loc=Proposition 1.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The afore-mentioned flat base change result is in fact a special case since for ''g'' flat the homotopy pullback (which is locally given by a derived tensor product) agrees with the ordinary pullback (locally given by the underived tensor product), and since the pullback along the flat maps ''g'' and ''g' ''are automatically derived (i.e., &lt;math&gt;Lg^* = g^*&lt;/math&gt;). The auxiliary assumptions related to the Tor-independence or Tor-amplitude in the preceding base change theorem also become unnecessary.

In the above form, base change has been extended by {{harvtxt|Ben-Zvi|Francis|Nadler|2010}} to the situation where ''X'', ''S'', and ''S' ''are (possibly derived) [[stack (mathematics)|stack]]s, provided that the map ''f'' is a perfect map (which includes the case that ''f'' is a quasi-compact, quasi-separated map of schemes, but also includes more general stacks, such as the [[classifying stack]] ''BG'' of an [[algebraic group]] in characteristic zero).

===Variants and applications===
Proper base change also holds in the context of [[complex manifolds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grauert|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[theorem on formal functions]] is a variant of the proper base change, where the pullback is replaced by a [[completion (metric space)|completion]] operation.

The [[see-saw principle]] and the [[theorem of the cube]], which are foundational facts in the theory of [[abelian varieties]], are a consequence of proper base change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mumford|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A base-change also holds for [[D-modules]]: if ''X'', ''S'', ''X','' and ''S' ''are smooth varieties (but ''f'' and ''g'' need not be flat or proper etc.), there is a quasi-isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;g^\dagger \int_f \mathcal F \to \int_{f'} g'^\dagger \mathcal F,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;-^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int&lt;/math&gt; denote the inverse and direct image functors for ''D''-modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hotta|Takeuchi|Tanisaki|2008|loc=Theorem 1.7.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Base change for étale sheaves==
For [[étale sheaf|étale torsion sheaves]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;, there are two base change results referred to as ''proper'' and ''smooth base change'', respectively: base change holds if &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; is [[proper morphism|proper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|Grothendieck|Verdier|1972|loc=Exposé XII}}, {{harvtxt|Milne|1980|loc=section VI.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds if ''g'' is [[smooth morphism|smooth]], provided that ''f'' is quasi-compact and provided that the torsion of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is prime to the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the [[residue field]]s of ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|Grothendieck|Verdier|1972|loc=Exposé XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely related to proper base change is the following fact (the two theorems are usually proved simultaneously): let ''X'' be a variety over a [[separably closed field]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; a [[constructible sheaf]] on &lt;math&gt;X_\text{et}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;H^r(X, \mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; are finite in each of the following cases:
*''X'' is complete, or 
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; has no ''p''-torsion, where ''p'' is the characteristic of ''k''.

Under additional assumptions, {{harvtxt|Deninger|1988}} extended the proper base change theorem to non-torsion étale sheaves.

===Applications===
In close analogy to the topological situation mentioned above, the base change map for an [[open immersion]] ''f'', 
:&lt;math&gt;g^* f_* \mathcal F \to f'_* g'^* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;
is not usually an isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Milne|2012|loc=Example 8.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the [[extension by zero]] functor &lt;math&gt;f_!&lt;/math&gt; satisfies an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;g^* f_! \mathcal F \to f'_! g^* \mathcal F.&lt;/math&gt;
This fact and the proper base change suggest to define the ''direct image functor with compact support'' for a map ''f'' by
:&lt;math&gt;Rf_! := Rp_* j_!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f = p \circ j&lt;/math&gt; is a ''compactification'' of ''f'', i.e., a factorization into an open immersion followed by a proper map.
The proper base change theorem is needed to show that this is well-defined, i.e., independent (up to isomorphism) of the choice of the compactification.
Moreover, again in analogy to the case of sheaves on a topological space, a base change formula for &lt;math&gt;g_*&lt;/math&gt; vs. &lt;math&gt;Rf_!&lt;/math&gt; does hold for non-proper maps ''f''.

For the structural map &lt;math&gt;f: X \to S = \operatorname{Spec} k&lt;/math&gt; of a scheme over a field ''k'', the individual cohomologies of &lt;math&gt;Rf_! (\mathcal F)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;H^*_c(X, \mathcal F)&lt;/math&gt; referred to as [[cohomology with compact support]]. It is an important variant of usual [[étale cohomology]].

Similar ideas are also used to construct an analogue of the functor &lt;math&gt;Rf_!&lt;/math&gt; in [[A1 homotopy theory|'''A'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-homotopy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Ayoub|first=Joseph|title=Les six opérations de Grothendieck et le formalisme des cycles évanescents dans le monde motivique.

[[File:Iso1.svg|thumb|right|350px|Bipolar coordinate system]]

'''Bipolar coordinates''' are a two-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]]. There are two commonly defined types of bipolar coordinates&lt;ref name=bip&gt;[http://bbs.sachina.pku.edu.cn/Stat/Math_World/math/b/b233.htm Eric W. Weisstein, '''Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics CD-ROM''', ''Bipolar Coordinates'', CD-ROM edition 1.0, May 20, 1999&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212005309/http://bbs.sachina.pku.edu.cn/Stat/Math_World/math/b/b233.htm |date=December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The first is based on the [[Apollonian circles]].  The curves of constant ''σ'' and of ''τ'' are circles that intersect at right angles.  The coordinates have two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which are generally taken to be fixed at (−''a'',&amp;nbsp;0) and (''a'',&amp;nbsp;0), respectively, on the ''x''-axis of a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].  The second system is [[two-center bipolar coordinates]]. There is also a third coordinate system that is based on two poles ([[biangular coordinates]]).  

The term "bipolar" is sometimes used to describe other curves having two singular points (foci), such as [[ellipse]]s, [[hyperbola]]s, and [[Cassini oval]]s.  However, the term ''bipolar coordinates'' is reserved for the coordinates described here, and never used to describe coordinates associated with those other curves, such as [[elliptic coordinates]].

[[File:Bipolar coordinates.png|thumb|right|350px|Geometric interpretation of the bipolar coordinates. The angle σ is formed by the two foci and the point '''P''', whereas ''τ'' is the logarithm of the ratio of distances to the foci. The corresponding circles of constant ''σ'' and ''τ'' are shown in red and blue, respectively, and meet at right angles (magenta box); they are orthogonal.]]

== Definition ==

The most common definition of bipolar coordinates (''σ'',&amp;nbsp;''τ'') is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \ \frac{\sinh \tau}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \ \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''σ''-coordinate of a point ''P'' equals the angle ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''P''&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the ''τ''-coordinate equals the [[natural logarithm]] of the ratio of the distances ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the foci 

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau = \ln \frac{d_1}{d_2}
&lt;/math&gt;

(Recall that ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are located at (−''a'',&amp;nbsp;0) and (''a'',&amp;nbsp;0), respectively.) Note that ''σ'' ranges from ''-π/2'' to ''π/2'', and ''τ'' ranges from &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  Equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;
x + i y = a i \cot\left( \frac{\sigma + i \tau}{2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Polyanin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Happel"/&gt;

== Curves of constant ''σ'' and ''τ'' ==

[[File:Bipolar sigma isosurfaces.png|right|280px]]

[[File:Bipolar tau isosurfaces.png|right|280px]]

The curves of constant ''σ'' correspond to non-concentric circles 

:&lt;math&gt;
x^2 +
\left( y - a \cot \sigma \right)^2 = \frac{a^{2}}{\sin^2 \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

that intersect at the two foci.  The centers of the constant-''σ'' circles lie on the ''y''-axis.  Circles of positive ''σ'' are centered above the ''x''-axis, whereas those of negative ''σ'' lie below the axis.  As the magnitude |''σ''| increases, the radius of the circles decreases and the center approaches the origin (0,&amp;nbsp;0), which is reached when |''σ''| = ''π''/2, its maximum value.

The curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are non-intersecting circles of different radii

:&lt;math&gt;
y^2 +
\left( x - a \coth \tau \right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{\sinh^2 \tau}
&lt;/math&gt;

that surround the foci but again are not concentric. The centers of the constant-''τ'' circles lie on the ''x''-axis.  The circles of positive ''τ'' lie in the right-hand side of the plane (''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0), whereas the circles of negative ''τ'' lie in the left-hand side of the plane (''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0).  The ''τ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 curve corresponds to the ''y''-axis (''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0).  As the magnitude of ''τ'' increases, the radius of the circles decreases and their centers approach the foci.

==Reciprocal relations==
The passage from the Cartesian coordinates towards the bipolar coordinates can be done via the following formulas:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \tau = \frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{(x + a)^2 + y^2}{(x - a)^2 + y^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
  \pi - \sigma = 2 \arctan \frac{2ay}{a^2 - x^2 - y^2 + \sqrt{(a^2 - x^2 - y^2)^2 + 4 a^2 y^2} }.
&lt;/math&gt;

We notice also those two remarkable identities: 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \tanh \tau = \frac{2 a x}{x^2 + y^2 + a^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
  \tan \sigma = \frac{2 a y}{x^2 + y^2 - a^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Scale factors ==
The scale factors for the bipolar coordinates (''σ'',&amp;nbsp;''τ'') are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\sigma = h_\tau = \frac{a}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the infinitesimal area element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dA = \frac{a^2}{\left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^2} \, d\sigma\, d\tau
&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[Laplacian]] is given by 

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 \Phi =
\frac{1}{a^2} \left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^2
\left( 
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \sigma^2} + 
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \tau^2}
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates (''σ'',&amp;nbsp;''τ'') by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].



==Applications==
The classic applications of bipolar coordinates are in solving [[partial differential equations]], e.g., [[Laplace's equation]] or the [[Helmholtz equation]], for which bipolar coordinates allow a [[separation_of_variables#pde|separation of variables]].  A typical example would be the [[electric field]] surrounding two parallel cylindrical conductors with differing diameters.

==Extension to 3-dimensions==
Bipolar coordinates form the basis for several sets of three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates]].

*The [[bipolar cylindrical coordinates]] are produced by translating the bipolar coordinates along the ''z''-axis, i.e., the out-of-plane axis.

*The [[bispherical coordinates]] are produced by rotating the bipolar coordinates about the ''x''-axis, i.e., the axis connecting the foci.

*The [[toroidal coordinates]] are produced by rotating the bipolar coordinates about the ''y''-axis, i.e., the axis separating the foci.

{{wiktionary|blue-pencil}}

The '''blue pencil doctrine''' is a legal concept in [[common law]] countries, where a [[court]] finds that portions of a [[contract]] is [[Void (law)|void]] or unenforceable, but other portions of the contract are [[enforceable]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The Blue Pencil Rule allows the legally-valid, enforceable provisions of the contract to stand despite the nullification of the legally-void, unenforceable provisions. However, the revised version must represent the original meaning; the rule may not be invoked, for example, to delete the word "not" and thereby change a negative to a positive.

==Etymology==
The term stems from the act of editing [[copy (written)|written copy]] with a [[blue pencil (editing)|blue pencil]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}{{Original research inline|date=September 2018}}

==In UK law==
The principle was established by the [[House of Lords]] in the case of ''[[Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co]]'' (1894).{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Other statutory provisions such as the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] and the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|date=17 March 1993
|accessdate=|title=Statutory Instrument 1994 No. 3159 - The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999
|publisher=[[The Stationery Office]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; have established the Blue Pencil principle in statute law.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In [[Rose &amp; Frank Co v JR Crompton &amp; Bros Ltd]], the Blue Pencil Rule was used to strike out an unacceptable clause in a [[memorandum of understanding]] agreement which appeared to try to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts. The unenforceable part having been excised, the remainder of the agreement was valid, and served to establish that the MOU agreement was not intended by the parties to be binding at law.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==In other jurisdictions==
In most jurisdictions, courts routinely "blue pencil" or reform [[Covenant (law)|covenants]] that are not reasonable.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The blue pencil doctrine gives courts the authority to either strike unreasonable clauses from a [[Non-compete clause|non-compete agreement]], leaving the rest to be enforced, or actually modify the agreement to reflect the terms that the parties originally could have&amp;mdash;and probably should have&amp;mdash;agreed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Putting the Blue Pencil Down: An Argument for Specificity in Noncompete Agreements|first=Griffin Toronjo|last=Pivateau|journal=[[Nebraska Law Review]]|volume=84|issue=3|ssrn=1007599|date=31 August 2007|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Israel]] the blue pencil method has been used to strike out illegal or unconstitutional parts of a statute, leaving the rest intact.&lt;ref&gt;http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/12/460/071/b24/12071460.b24.htm Supreme Court decision regarding illegal aliens of 16 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7311">{{technical|date=June 2018}}&lt;!-- Needs a plain-English definition without mathematical symbols --&gt;
The (standard) '''Boolean model of information retrieval (BIR)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author1=Lancaster, F.W. | author2=Fayen, E.G. | title=Information Retrieval On-Line | publisher=Melville Publishing Co., Los Angeles, California | year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a classical [[information retrieval]] (IR) model and, at the same time, the first and most-adopted one. It is used by many IR systems to this day.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The BIR is based on [[Boolean logic]] and classical [[set theory]] in that both the documents to be searched and the user's query are conceived as sets of terms. Retrieval is based on whether or not the documents contain the query terms. 

==Definitions==

An ''index term'' is a word or expression'','' which may be [[stemming|stemmed]], describing or characterizing a document,  such as a keyword given for a journal article. Let&lt;math display="block"&gt;T = \{t_1, t_2,\ \ldots,\ t_m\}&lt;/math&gt;be the set of all such index terms. 

A ''document'' is any subset of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Let&lt;math display="block"&gt;D = \{D_1,\ \ldots\ ,D_n\}&lt;/math&gt;be the set of all documents. 

A ''query'' is a Boolean expression &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; in normal form:&lt;math display="block"&gt;Q = (W_1\ \or\ W_2\ \or\ \cdots) \and\ \cdots\ \and\ (W_i\ \or\ W_{i+1}\ \or\ \cdots)&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt; is true for &lt;math&gt;D_j&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;t_i \in D_j&lt;/math&gt;. (Equivalently, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; could be expressed in  [[disjunctive normal form]].)

We seek to find the set of documents that satisfy &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  This operation is called ''retrieval'' and consists of the following two steps:

: 1. For each &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W_j&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, find the set &lt;math display="inline"&gt;S_j&lt;/math&gt; of documents that satisfy &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W_j&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;math display="block"&gt;S_j = \{D_i\mid W_j\}&lt;/math&gt;2. Then the set of documents that satisfy Q is given by:&lt;math display="block"&gt;(S_1 \cup S_2 \cup \cdots) \cap \cdots \cap (S_i \cup S_{i+1} \cup \cdots)&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==

Let the set of original (real) documents be, for example

: &lt;math&gt;O = \{O_1,\ O_2,\ O_3\}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; = "Bayes' principle: The principle that, in estimating a parameter, one should initially assume that each possible value has equal probability (a uniform prior  distribution)."

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; = "[[Bayes' theorem|Bayesian decision theory]]: A mathematical theory of decision-making which presumes utility and probability functions, and according to which the act to be chosen is the Bayes act, i.e. the one with highest subjective expected utility. If one had unlimited time and calculating power with which to make every decision, this procedure would be the best way to make any decision."

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;O_3&lt;/math&gt; = "Bayesian [[epistemology]]: A philosophical theory which holds that the epistemic status of a proposition (i.e. how well proven or well established it is) is best measured by a probability and that the proper way to revise this probability is given by Bayesian conditionalisation or similar procedures. A Bayesian epistemologist would use probability to define, and explore the relationship between, concepts such as epistemic status, support or explanatory power."

Let the set &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of terms be:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;T = \{t_1=\text{Bayes' principle}, t_2=\text{probability}, t_3=\text{decision-making}, t_4=\text{Bayesian epistemology}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, the set &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of documents is as follows:

: &lt;math display="block"&gt;D = \{D_1,\ D_2,\ D_3\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
D_1 &amp;= \{\text{probability},\ \text{Bayes' principle}\} \\
D_2 &amp;= \{\text{probability},\ \text{decision-making}\} \\
D_3 &amp;= \{\text{probability},\ \text{Bayesian epistemology}\}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Let the query &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;Q = \text{probability} \and \text{decision-making}&lt;/math&gt;Then to retrieve the relevant documents:
# Firstly, the following sets &lt;math display="inline"&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; of documents &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt;  are obtained (retrieved):&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
S_1 &amp;= \{D_1,\ D_2,\ D_3\} \\
S_2 &amp;= \{D_2\}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
# Finally, the following documents &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; are retrieved in response to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math display="block"&gt;Q: \{D_1,\ D_2,\ D_3\}\ \cap\ \{D_2\}\ =\ \{D_2\}&lt;/math&gt;
This means that the original document &lt;math display="inline"&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; (corresponding to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D_2&lt;/math&gt;) is the answer to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.

Obviously, if there is more than one document with the same representation, every such document is retrieved. Such documents are indistinguishable in the BIR (in other words, equivalent).

== Advantages ==

* Clean formalism
* Easy to implement
* Intuitive concept

== Disadvantages ==

* [[String search algorithm|Exact matching]] may retrieve too few or too many documents
* Hard to translate a query into a Boolean expression
* All terms are equally weighted
* More like ''[[data retrieval]]'' than ''information retrieval''

== Data structures and algorithms ==

From a pure formal mathematical point of view, the BIR is straightforward. From a practical point of view, however, several further problems should be solved that relate to algorithms and data structures, such as, for example, the choice of terms (manual or automatic selection or both), [[stemming]], [[hash table]]s, [[Inverted index|inverted file]] structure, and so on.&lt;ref name="wartik"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wartik | first = Steven | title = Information Retrieval Data Structures &amp; Algorithms | chapter = Boolean operations | publisher = Prentice-Hall, Inc. | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-13-463837-9 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/13742235/Information-Retrieval-Data-Structures-Algorithms-William-B-Frakes | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928060217/http://www.scribd.com/doc/13742235/Information-Retrieval-Data-Structures-Algorithms-William-B-Frakes | archivedate = 2013-09-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hash sets ===

Another possibility is to use [[hash set]]s. Each document is represented by a hash table which contains every single term of that document. Since hash table size increases and decreases in real time with the addition and removal of terms, each document will occupy much less space in memory. However, it will have a slowdown in performance because the operations are more complex than with [[bit vector]]s. On the worst-case performance can degrade from O(''n'') to O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). On the average case, the performance slowdown will not be that much worse than bit vectors and the space usage is much more efficient.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19147">'''Case-based evidence''' is a scientific method based on the supposition that certain human behavioural patterns, also including basic attitudes and stances, and with particular reference to the acceptance of systems, technical devices and procedures, can be transferred from a series of given problems, the 'analogical sources', to another, current problem, the 'analogical target'. 
The term "case-based evidence“ and the procedure described in the following was first used and coined in work carried out by the Information Management Institute (IMI) of the Aschaffenburg University of Applied Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.h-ab.de/index.php?id=55&amp;L=1 ''Aschaffenburg University of Applied Sciences''].&lt;/ref&gt; (Professor Georg Rainer Hofmann) in 2009.

== Procedure ==
The case-based evidence method involves a number of steps&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, Meike; Hofmann, Georg Rainer: „Case-based Evidence - Grundlagen und Anwendung“, Springer Vieweg, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Analogy|Analogies]] form the core of the method; the findings thus supplied comprise mechanisms that are (presumed to be) transferable from analogical sources to a current case. These mechanisms are then presented in a synoptic model and ultimately tested in a series of qualified expert interviews.

=== Formulating the research question ===
Outlining the problem can be seen as the most important fundamental factor determining the process of locating suitable [[Analogy|analogies]]. Only when the [[research question]] precisely addresses the most urgent knowledge gap that is relevant for gaining [[acceptance]] will it be possible to search for and find suitable analogous cases in which this knowledge gap can be closed as exactly, precisely and appropriately as possible.

=== Identifying relevant analogical components ===
In order to find suitable [[Analogy|analogies]], it is first necessary to closely examine the case at hand, the analogical target, and the problem to be solved. This consists of locating those [[wikt:component|component]]s that are presumed to have the greatest influence on the problem to be solved. Relevant analogical components can be found in:
* The characteristics of the case under examination,
* The relationships between characteristics,
* The user group, or
* The relationship between the user group and the components of the case.
There is as yet no known algorithm-based solution for accurately locating a feasible [[analogy]]. However, an analogy will only prove to be feasible once it is based on relevant analogical components.

=== Identifying analogous cases ===
Based on these found analogical components and the abstract formulation of the problem, a search can be made for analogous cases – the analogical sources. The search for analogous cases can be performed from two perspectives:
* A structural analogy places the focus on detecting characteristics and structures from the outset situation in the analogy. This form of analogy is preferred for existing products and services as well as for ongoing projects. The starting point of the search is based on those factors of the analogical target that are seen as critical for acceptance. The search should therefore focus on cases that display a similarity in terms of the stated critical factors and for which the resulting, expected acceptance problems have already solved. The acceptance of a product, service or project can depend on several attributes, depending on the individual circumstances; it is therefore advisable to search for a separate analogy for each case component considered relevant to such acceptance. 
* A target analogy focuses on the goal to be attained in the given case. The search aims at finding a 'role model', i.e. it has already achieved the goal that is to be attained with the given case.&lt;ref&gt;Horton G: Bessere Ideen finden mit der Zielanalogie. Abrufbar unter: http://www.zephram.de/blog/ideenfindung/ideen-finden-zielanalogie/&lt;/ref&gt; This goal should be described at different levels of abstraction, to allow both close and distant analogies to be addressed. This form of analogy is particularly useful in projects that are currently in their planning phase or in innovative product developments.

=== Research-based activities ===
The point in the case-based evidence process at which further research is appropriate depends on the expertise that is available ad hoc with respect to the analogical goal and the analogical sources. The aim of the research and theoretical preconsiderations is to research and document both the analogical target, which is predetermined, and all the information relevant to the analogical sources that is 'unproblematically researchable'. As for determining the extent of the research, there is no real guide value, but a pragmatic approach would be to avoid trivial questions being asked in the subsequent [[expert]] interviews, answers to which may be found by a simple query in an Internet [[Web search engine|search engine]].

=== Drawing analogical conclusions ===
The components of analogical conclusions in the case-based evidence method can be described as follows: 
# ''Current case – analogical target''. The starting point is a given case in which the motives leading the persons involved to behave in a certain way cannot be clearly identified or are undetermined and therefore constitute the research question. Moreover, it is not clear what [[parameter|parameters]] lead to a change in behaviour, e.g. an improvement in [[acceptance]]. 
# ''Comparative cases – analogical sources''. Similarly structured, or [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]], cases that can be found either historically or currently in 'other' thematic fields and economic areas are identified. In these comparative cases, the [[parameter|parameters]] that lead to particular cognitive processes and behaviours are known (or better known). 
# ''Isomorphically based conclusion''. Conclusions are drawn regarding the analogical target, based on the findings from analogical sources.

The fine art consists of locating precisely these feasible analogies&lt;ref&gt;Kalogerakis, Katharina: „Innovative Analogien in der Praxis der Produktentwicklung“, Gabler Verlag, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and transferring the attitude and behaviour schemas thus identified to the problem of the current case, such as the market [[acceptance]] of an innovative IT system. The connection between the analogical source and the analogical target is admittedly not a causal one, as they are 'really' independent of each other. However, it can be observed in many examples that certain mechanisms, such as people's behavioural patterns, can be transferred from one case to another. In [[cognitive psychology]], the ability to perceive analogies and transfer found isomorphs from analogical source to analogical target is a central process, and is even deemed an absolutely fundamental cultural achievement of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Kalogerakis, Katharina: „Innovative Analogien in der Praxis der Produktentwicklung“, Gabler Verlag, 2010, S. 14 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This circumstance is currently the subject of intensive discussion in modern popular scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, Douglas; Sander, Emmanuel: „Die Analogie: Das Herz des Denkens“, Klett-Cotta, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It should nevertheless be stated that from a scientific-theoretical point of view, the formation of analogies has no causal-methodical basis whatsoever. Here, the principle of cause and effect stands back in favour of the means-to-an-end principle.

=== Synoptic modelling ===
Synoptic modelling, according to the encyclopaedic guidelines of [[Jürgen Mittelstraß]]&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Mittelstraß (Hrsg.): „Enzyklopädie, Philosophie und Wissenschaftstheorie“, J. B. Metzler, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;, has to satisfy the following criteria:
# Abstract: the model, as a restricted mapping of reality, must be 'simpler' than the sum of observations. 
# Relevant: the model must 'have something to do' with the research object under investigation.
# [[Prediction|Predictive]]: the model must allow statements to be made about the research object, especially and in particular about its future behaviour.
# Communicable: the model must be such that it can be communicated in the scientific community; it must not be 'arbitrarily incomprehensible'. 

A further factor is the aspect of deficiencies in the model, such as [[wikt:redundancy|redundancies]], [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] and [[contradiction|contradictions]]. It has not gone unrecognised that synoptic modelling has a certain 'degree of creativeness'. 

=== Series of qualified expert interviews ===
In a third step, to verify the [[evidence]], the conclusions are assessed by means of structured interviews with selected [[expert|experts]] (analogical source). Rather than questioning a large number of 'representative' people, a comparatively (or even very) small group is subjected to qualified and [[structured interviewing]]. The selection of those questioned presumes the so-called 'expert assumption'&lt;ref&gt;Bredl, Klaus; Lehner, Franz; Gruber, Hans; Strasser, Josef: Kompetenzerwerb von Consultants in der Unternehmensberatung. In: Hofmann, Georg Rainer; Alm, Wolfgang (Hrsg.): Management der Mitarbeiter-Expertise in IT-Beratungsbetrieben – Grundlagen, Methoden und Werkzeuge: Tagungsband zur Multikonferenz Wirtschaftsinformatik 2002. Information Management Institut, Hochschule Aschaffenburg, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and attempts to include as fully as possible the expertise to be covered.
A certain degree of dismissiveness has established itself in the context of empirical findings, when [[empirical research]] is based on a small 'n', i.e. the findings are based on a small number of interviews. This is inexplicable taking into consideration the small overall number of qualified persons who can be questioned.

== Application ==
Case-based evidence has proven itself particularly well when it comes to the investigation of [[acceptance]] and trust in products and processes. In this area, forecasts of the probable acceptance of new products, services, processes, or similar can often be made with particular success and indications extracted from isomorphic cases as to how the probability of acceptance can be increased in particular cases. 
These approaches take into consideration a close cooperation with other academics – both scientists and practitioners – with regard to the following points:
* Identification and expert analysis of isomorphic analogies and scenarios,
* Due professional planning and appropriate psychosocial implementation of interviews,
* Modelling in accordance with the findings of the research and interviews.

== Classification: the case-based evidence method and the middle range theory ==
As the field of business information systems developed over the thirty year period between around 1980 and 2010, it took on an interface function that places it between the technically based field of (core) computer science and the application-oriented field of business management. These two central questions, the one of a technical (concerning engineering design) and the other of a business management (concerning the useful value of the applications) nature, together form one of the focuses of [[business informatics]] in the German-speaking world. The method of case-based evidence is based on analogy, in contrast to learning through [[inductive reasoning]] and [[deductive reasoning]]. In [[business informatics]], drawing inductive conclusions from observed phenomena and applying them to more general knowledge ('economic theory') is a widespread way of evaluating technical and economic systems. 
In turn, (predictive) deductions are made from 'theory' onto new or future phenomena. It is the subject of heated discussion ('based on scientific theory') what precise form inductive conclusions and the deduction process should have; one expression of this is that of design science research.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hubert Österle|Österle, Hubert]]; Winter, Robert; [[Walter Brenner|Brenner, Walter]] (Hrsg.): „Gestaltungsorientierte Wirtschaftsinformatik: Ein Plädoyer für Rigor und Relevanz“, book-on-demand, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[critical rationalism]] along the lines of [[Karl Popper]] rejects induction as an illusion and disputes the possibility of objective knowledge progress, in distinct contrast to the objective progress of knowledge in [[dialectic|Hegel's dialectic]].
Regarding the observation of personal behaviour  – in the social sciences – inductive conclusions are often difficult, because they frequently involve quantitative, ambiguous statements ('half and half' statements). Hence, the formulation of generally valid laws of social behaviour is often dispensed with in favour of a 'quantifying' – as it were prosaic – presentation. 
One way out of this hardly satisfying situation is to do away with spatially and temporally unlimited 'natural scientific' theories ('[[grand theory|grand theories']]), in favour of the middle range theory. This term was established by [[Robert K. Merton]] in 1949 and further elaborated on in the 1960s. The [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle range theories]] go beyond the mere empirical description of social behavioural modes and pursue a subjective-interpretative approach which is rooted in the synoptic modelling that is based on historical-empirical observation; local, spatially and temporally restricted statements are then sufficient. The statements of the theories of middle range should be regarded as neither highly complex nor trivial. 

== Examples from applied research ==
The examples referred to in the following refer to work carried out at the Information Management Institute of the Aschaffenburg University of Applied Sciences.

=== Acceptance of cloud computing ===
The study into the acceptance of [[cloud computing]]&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, Georg Rainer; Schumacher, Meike: „Studie zur Akzeptanz von Cloud Computing“, EuroCloud Deutschland_eco e. V., EuroCloud Austria, 2012, Köln, Wien&lt;/ref&gt; by IMI and EuroCloud Deutschland_eco e. V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurocloud.de ''Eurocloud Deutschland_eco e.V.''].&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at developing practicable measures that are useful when it comes to alleviating the deficient market acceptance of cloud computing. In turn, the reason why market acceptance seemed lacking appeared to stem from deficient operational and data security as well as legal considerations. 
As shown by a comparison of other, isomorphic cases (acceptance of premium motor cars, bank products, [[DATEV]] eG), several aspects, such as technical features or purchase price, which are currently regarded as significant in the cloud computing discussion, can be deemed here as non-decisive purchasing factors. It would be far more conducive to reinforce the trust of buyers and the usefulness of the product, by means of the following essential factors:
* Potential information transparency – the customer is able to obtain information about the product and the manufacturing process,
* The customer is informed as to the maturity of the technology – which requires consistent customer training for a product,
* Formation of closed customer groups – a certain level of qualification is required before a person can become a customer; in other words, not just anybody can become a customer,
* Setting up public warranties and liability shifts – such as are already familiar from savings banks (Sparkassen) and cooperatives,
* Psychology of the 'transfer' of sympathy and responsibility to the IT system,
* Reduction of the discussion concerning system prices and technical details.

For the cloud computing industry, the building up of a 'culture of trust' to gain the acceptance of private and commercial customers will be indispensable. This undertaking will doubtlessly take a certain amount of time and will not respond to any attempt at forcing; however, it does lend itself to positive influencing and correct orientation by applying the measures identified in the project.&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, Georg Rainer; Schumacher, Meike: „Abschätzung der Akzeptanz von IT-Systemen mittels Methoden der Case-based Evidences und Qualifizierten Experteninterviews – ein Metathema der Integration und Konnexion“ in: Integration und Konnexion, Tagungsband zur AKWI 2013, Verlag News und Media, Berlin, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acceptance of IT terminal equipment recycling ===
The work being done at the IMI on the acceptance of recycling IT terminal equipment pursues the basic idea of addressing the attitude towards recycling IT terminal equipment, for example, discarded mobile phones, on the one hand by analysing isomorphic scenarios and on the other by conducting expert interviews. The isomorphic scenarios analysed were the recycling of drinks bottles and cans (including those with a [[Container deposit legislation|single-use deposit]] or drink can deposit), second-hand clothing, and the return and [[recycling]] of waste oil in the mineral oil industry. In addition, the technical problems encountered in disposing of and reconditioning mobile telephones were discussed. The results obtained were compiled into an action framework for shaping the process of introducing recycling systems for IT terminal equipment. However the business foundation for the operative implementation was withdrawn following a change in the regulatory position (municipal 'notification requirement') in mid-2012.

=== Other examples ===
An analogical conclusion from the historical development of automobility can be drawn for the acceptance of [[electric vehicle|electromobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Lessing, Hans-Erhard: Automobilität – Karl Drais und die unglaublichen Anfänge. Maxime Verlage, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the spread of two-wheeled automobiles was a precursor to that of the four-wheeled automobile. This suggests that it would be advisable to devote particular attention to the market development of electric bicycles and motorcycles. The debate on [[net neutrality]] calls on the one hand for a network that does not distinguish between communications on the basis of their content and in which data is treated the same irrespective of the sender and receiver. The aim is to avoid competition-distorting measures that would promote the formation of a [[monopoly]]. In the case of a data bottleneck in the Internet, no distinction is made in terms of the content being transported. On the other hand, the debate also calls for an egalitarian net that does not admit differences in service class. This means in turn that there is no way of ensuring the service quality of a particular transmission. In this example, knowledge can be enhanced by drawing analogical conclusions from public road traffic: mechanisms such as special lanes for buses or bicycles in cities, special rights for emergency vehicles of the rescue services, from regulations, such as those controlling oversize transports or convoys, and from a drop in or absence of [[marginal cost|marginal costs]], represented by an Internet [[flat rate]]. Each of these displays interesting isomorphic analogies.

In [[mathematics]], a '''Cauchy sequence''' ({{IPA-fr|koʃi}}; {{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|k|oʊ|ʃ|iː}} {{respell|KOH|shee}}), named after [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], is a [[sequence]] whose [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] become arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Serge (1993), Algebra (Third ed.), Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley Pub. Co., {{ISBN|978-0-201-55540-0}}, {{Zbl|0848.13001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More precisely, given any small positive distance, all but a finite number of elements of the sequence are less than that given distance from each other.

It is not sufficient for each term to become arbitrarily close to the {{em|preceding}} term. For instance, in the sequence of square roots of natural numbers:
:&lt;math&gt;a_n=\sqrt n,&lt;/math&gt;
the consecutive terms become arbitrarily close to each other:
:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+1}-a_n = \sqrt{n+1}-\sqrt{n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}+\sqrt{n}} &lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt n}.&lt;/math&gt;
However, with growing values of the index {{mvar|n}}, the terms {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} become arbitrarily large, so for any index {{mvar|n}} and distance {{mvar|d}}, there exists an index {{mvar|m}} big enough such that {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; – ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''d''}}. (Actually, any {{math|''m'' &gt; ({{sqrt|''n''}} + ''d'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} suffices.) As a result, despite how far one goes, the remaining terms of the sequence never get close to {{em|each other}}, hence the sequence is not Cauchy.

The utility of Cauchy sequences lies in the fact that in a [[complete metric space]] (one where all such sequences are known to [[limit of a sequence|converge to a limit]]), the criterion for [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] depends only on the terms of the sequence itself, as opposed to the definition of convergence, which uses the limit value as well as the terms. This is often exploited in [[algorithm]]s, both theoretical and applied,  where an [[Iterative method|iterative process]] can be shown relatively easily to produce a Cauchy sequence, consisting of the iterates, thus fulfilling a logical condition, such as termination.

The notions above are not as unfamiliar as they might at first appear. The customary acceptance of the fact that any [[real number]] ''x'' has a [[decimal expansion]] is an implicit acknowledgment that a particular Cauchy sequence of rational numbers (whose terms are the successive [[truncation]]s of the decimal expansion of ''x'') has the real limit ''x''. In some cases it may be difficult to describe ''x'' independently of such a limiting process involving [[rational number]]s.

Generalizations of Cauchy sequences in more abstract [[uniform spaces]] exist in the form of [[Cauchy filter]]s and [[Cauchy net]]s.

==In real numbers==
A sequence

:&lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

of real numbers is called a Cauchy sequence, if for every [[positive and negative numbers|positive]] real number ''ε'', there is a positive [[integer]] ''N'' such that for all [[natural numbers]] ''m'', ''n'' &gt; ''N''

:&lt;math&gt;|x_m - x_n| &lt; \varepsilon, &lt;/math&gt;

where the vertical bars denote the [[absolute value]].  In a similar way one can define Cauchy sequences of rational or complex numbers.  Cauchy formulated such a condition by requiring &lt;math&gt;x_m - x_n&lt;/math&gt; to be [[infinitesimal]] for every pair of infinite ''m'', ''n''.

==In a metric space==

Since the definition of a Cauchy sequence only involves metric concepts, it is straightforward to generalize it to any metric space ''X''. To do so, the absolute value |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; - ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;| is replaced by the distance ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) (where ''d'' denotes a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]) between ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Formally, given a [[metric space]] (''X'', ''d''), a sequence

:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...

is Cauchy, if for every positive [[real number]] ''ε'' &gt; 0 there is a positive  [[integer]] ''N'' such that for all positive integers ''m'', ''n'' &gt; ''N'', the distance

:''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; ''ε''.

Roughly speaking, the terms of the sequence are getting closer and closer together in a way that suggests that the sequence ought to have a [[limit of a sequence|limit]] in ''X''. Nonetheless, such a limit does not always exist within ''X''.

==Completeness==
A metric space (''X'', ''d'') in which every Cauchy sequence converges to an element of ''X'' is called [[Complete metric space|complete]].

===Examples===
The [[real number]]s are complete under the metric induced by the usual absolute value, and one of the standard [[Construction of the real numbers|constructions of the real numbers]] involves Cauchy sequences of [[rational number]]s. In this construction, each equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers with a certain tail behavior—that is, each class of sequences that get arbitrarily close to one another— is a real number.

A rather different type of example is afforded by a metric space ''X'' which has the [[discrete space|discrete metric]] (where any two distinct  points are at distance 1 from each other). Any Cauchy sequence of elements of ''X'' must be constant beyond some fixed point, and converges to the eventually repeating term.

===Counter-example: rational numbers===
The [[rational number]]s '''Q''' are not complete (for the usual distance):&lt;br/&gt;
There are sequences of rationals that converge (in '''R''') to [[irrational number]]s; these are Cauchy sequences having no limit in '''Q'''. In fact, if a real number ''x'' is irrational, then the sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), whose ''n''-th term is the truncation to ''n'' decimal places of the decimal expansion of ''x'', gives a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers with irrational limit ''x''. Irrational numbers certainly exist in '''R''', for example:

* The sequence defined by &lt;math&gt; x_0=1, x_{n+1}=\frac{x_n+\frac{2}{x_n}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; consists of rational numbers (1, 3/2, 17/12,...), which is clear from the definition; however it converges to the [[irrational number|irrational]] square root of two, see [[Methods of computing square roots#Babylonian method|Babylonian method of computing square root]].
* The sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n = F_n / F_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; of ratios of consecutive [[Fibonacci number]]s which, if it converges at all, converges to a limit &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\phi^2 = \phi+1&lt;/math&gt;, and no rational number has this property.  If one considers this as a sequence of real numbers, however, it converges to the real number &lt;math&gt;\varphi = (1+\sqrt5)/2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Golden ratio]], which is irrational.
* The values of the exponential, sine and cosine functions, exp(''x''), sin(''x''), cos(''x''), are known to be irrational for any rational value of ''x''≠0, but each can be defined as the limit of a rational Cauchy sequence, using, for instance, the [[Maclaurin series]].

===Counter-example: open interval===
The open interval &lt;math&gt; X = (0, 2) &lt;/math&gt; in the set of real numbers with an ordinary distance in '''R''' is not a complete space: there is a sequence &lt;math&gt; x_n = 1/n &lt;/math&gt; in it, which is Cauchy (for arbitrarily small distance bound &lt;math&gt; d &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; all terms &lt;math&gt; x_n &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; n &gt; 1/d &lt;/math&gt; fit in the &lt;math&gt; (0, d) &lt;/math&gt; interval), however does not converge in &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; — its 'limit', number &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, does not belong to the space &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;.

===Other properties===
* Every convergent sequence (with limit ''s'', say) is a Cauchy sequence, since, given any real number ''ε'' &gt; 0, beyond some fixed point, every term of the sequence is within distance ''ε''/2 of ''s'', so any two terms of the sequence are within distance ''ε'' of each other.
* In any metric space, a Cauchy sequence is [[bounded function|bounded]] (since for some ''N'', all terms of the sequence from the ''N''-th onwards are within distance 1 of each other, and if ''M'' is the largest distance of the terms up to and including the ''N''-th, then no term of the sequence has distance greater than ''M'' + 1 from {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''}}).
* In any metric space, a Cauchy sequence which has a convergent subsequence with limit ''s'' is itself convergent (with the same limit), since, given any real number ''r'' &gt; 0, beyond some fixed point in the original sequence, every term of the subsequence is within distance ''r''/2 of ''s'', and any two terms of the original sequence are within distance ''r''/2 of each other, so every term of the original sequence is within distance ''r'' of ''s''.

These last two properties, together with the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]], yield one standard proof of the completeness of the real numbers, closely related to both the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem and the [[Heine–Borel theorem]]. Every Cauchy sequence of real numbers is bounded, hence by Bolzano-Weierstrass has a convergent subsequence, hence is itself convergent. It should be noted, though, that this proof of the completeness of the real numbers implicitly makes use of the [[least upper bound axiom]]. The alternative approach, mentioned above, of {{em|constructing}} the real numbers as the [[Completion (metric space)|completion]] of the rational numbers, makes the completeness of the real numbers tautological.

One of the standard illustrations of the advantage of being able to work with Cauchy sequences and make use of completeness is provided by consideration of the summation of an [[infinite series]] of real numbers
(or, more generally, of elements of any complete [[normed linear space]], or [[Banach space]]).  Such a series 
&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is considered to be convergent if and only if the sequence of [[partial sum]]s &lt;math&gt;(s_{m})&lt;/math&gt; is convergent, where 
&lt;math&gt; s_{m} = \sum_{n=1}^{m} x_{n}&lt;/math&gt;. It is a routine matter 
to determine whether the sequence of partial sums is Cauchy or not,
since for positive integers ''p'' &gt; ''q'', 
:&lt;math&gt; s_{p} - s_{q} = \sum_{n=q+1}^{p} x_{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f \colon M \rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; is a [[uniformly continuous]] map between the metric spaces ''M'' and ''N'' and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a Cauchy sequence in ''M'', then &lt;math&gt;(f(x_n))&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence in ''N''. If &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y_n)&lt;/math&gt; are two Cauchy sequences in the rational, real or complex numbers, then the sum &lt;math&gt;(x_n + y_n)&lt;/math&gt; and the product &lt;math&gt;(x_n y_n)&lt;/math&gt; are also Cauchy sequences.

==Generalizations==

===In topological vector spaces===
There is also a concept of Cauchy sequence for a [[topological vector space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;: Pick a [[local base]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; about 0; then (&lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt;) is a Cauchy sequence if for each member &lt;math&gt;V\in B&lt;/math&gt;, there is some number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever 
&lt;math&gt;n,m &gt; N, 
x_n - x_m&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. If the topology of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is compatible with a [[translation-invariant metric]] &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, the two definitions agree.

===In topological groups===

Since the topological vector space definition of Cauchy sequence requires only that there be a continuous "subtraction" operation, it can just as well be stated in the context of a [[topological group]]: A sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_k)&lt;/math&gt; in a topological group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence if for every open neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of the [[identity element|identity]] in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; there exists some number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever &lt;math&gt; m,n&gt;N &lt;/math&gt; it follows that &lt;math&gt;x_n x_m^{-1} \in U&lt;/math&gt;. As above, it is sufficient to check this for the neighbourhoods in any local base of the identity in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

As in the [[Complete metric space#Completion|construction of the completion of a metric space]], one can furthermore define the binary relation on Cauchy sequences in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;(x_k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y_k)&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent if for every open [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of the identity in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; there exists some number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever &lt;math&gt; m,n&gt;N &lt;/math&gt; it follows that &lt;math&gt;x_n y_m^{-1} \in U&lt;/math&gt;. This relation is an [[equivalence relation]]: It is reflexive since the sequences are Cauchy sequences. It is symmetric since &lt;math&gt;y_n x_m^{-1} = (x_m y_n^{-1})^{-1} \in U^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; which by continuity of the inverse is another open neighbourhood of the identity. It is [[Transitive relation|transitive]] since &lt;math&gt;x_n z_l^{-1} = x_n y_m^{-1} y_m z_l^{-1} \in U' U''&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;U'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U''&lt;/math&gt; are open neighbourhoods of the identity such that &lt;math&gt;U'U'' \subseteq U&lt;/math&gt;; such pairs exist by the continuity of the group operation.

===In groups===

There is also a concept of Cauchy sequence in a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;:
Let &lt;math&gt;H=(H_r)&lt;/math&gt; be a decreasing sequence of [[normal subgroup]]s of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of finite [[index of a subgroup|index]].
Then a sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is said to be Cauchy (w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;) [[if and only if]] for any &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; there is &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\forall m,n &gt; N, x_n x_m^{-1} \in H_r&lt;/math&gt;.

Technically, this is the same thing as a topological group Cauchy sequence for a particular choice of topology on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, namely that for which &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a local base.

The set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of such Cauchy sequences forms a group (for the componentwise product), and the set &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt; of null sequences (s.th. &lt;math&gt;\forall r, \exists N, \forall n &gt; N, x_n \in H_r&lt;/math&gt;) is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. The [[factor group]] &lt;math&gt;C/C_0&lt;/math&gt; is called the completion of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

One can then show that this completion is isomorphic to the [[inverse limit]] of the sequence &lt;math&gt;(G/H_r)&lt;/math&gt;.

An example of this construction, familiar in [[number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]] is the construction of the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic completion]] of the integers with respect to a prime ''p''. In this case, ''G'' is the integers under addition, and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the additive subgroup consisting of integer multiples of ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] sequence (i.e., any normal subgroup of finite index contains some &lt;math&gt;H_r&lt;/math&gt;), then this completion is [[Canonical form|canonical]] in the sense that it is isomorphic to the inverse limit of &lt;math&gt;(G/H)_H&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; varies over {{em|all}} normal subgroups of finite [[index of a subgroup|index]]. For further details, see ch. I.10 in [[Serge Lang|Lang]]'s "Algebra".

===In constructive mathematics===
{{Tone|section|date=August 2018}}
In [[constructive mathematics]], Cauchy sequences often must be given with a ''modulus of Cauchy convergence'' to be useful. If &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, x_3, ...)&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence in the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then a modulus of Cauchy convergence for the sequence is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; from the set of [[natural number]]s to itself, such that &lt;math&gt;\forall k \forall m, n &gt; \alpha(k), |x_m - x_n| &lt; 1/k&lt;/math&gt;.

Clearly, any sequence with a modulus of Cauchy convergence is a Cauchy sequence. The converse (that every Cauchy sequence has a modulus) follows from the [[well-ordering property]] of the natural numbers (let &lt;math&gt;\alpha(k)&lt;/math&gt; be the smallest possible &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; in the definition of Cauchy sequence, taking &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;1/k&lt;/math&gt;). However, this well-ordering property does not hold in constructive mathematics (it is equivalent to the principle of [[excluded middle]]). On the other hand, this converse also follows (directly) from the principle of [[dependent choice]] (in fact, it will follow from the weaker AC&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt;), which is generally accepted by constructive mathematicians. Thus, moduli of Cauchy convergence are needed directly only by constructive mathematicians who (like [[Fred Richman]]) do not wish to use any form of choice.

That said, using a modulus of Cauchy convergence can simplify both definitions and theorems in constructive analysis. Perhaps even more useful are ''regular Cauchy sequences'', sequences with a given modulus of Cauchy convergence (usually &lt;math&gt;\alpha(k) = k&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\alpha(k) = 2^k&lt;/math&gt;). Any Cauchy sequence with a modulus of Cauchy convergence is equivalent (in the sense used to form the [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of a metric space) to a regular Cauchy sequence; this can be proved without using any form of the axiom of choice. Regular Cauchy sequences were used by [[Errett Bishop]] in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7I-AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Foundations+intitle:of+intitle:constructive+intitle:analysis&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;pgis=1 Foundations of Constructive Analysis], but they have also been used by [[Douglas Bridges]] in a non-constructive textbook ({{ISBN|978-0-387-98239-7}}). However, Bridges also works on mathematical constructivism; the concept has not spread far outside of that milieu.

===In a hyperreal continuum===
A real sequence &lt;math&gt;\langle u_n: n\in \mathbb{N} \rangle&lt;/math&gt; has a natural [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] extension, defined for [[hypernatural]] values ''H'' of the index ''n'' in addition to the usual natural ''n''.  The sequence is Cauchy if and only if for every infinite ''H'' and ''K'', the values &lt;math&gt;u_H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_K&lt;/math&gt; are infinitely close, or [[adequality|adequal]], i.e. 
:&lt;math&gt;\, \mathrm{st}(u_H-u_K)= 0&lt;/math&gt; 
where "st" is the [[standard part function]].

===Cauchy completion of categories===

{{harvtxt|Krause|2018}} introduced a notion of Cauchy completion of a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. Applied to '''Q''' (the category whose objects are rational numbers, and there is a morphism from ''x'' to ''y'' if and only if ''x'' &amp;le; ''y''), this Cauchy completion yields '''R''' (again interpreted as a category using its natural ordering).

'''Cloth modeling''' is the term used for simulating cloth within a computer program; usually in the context of [[3D computer graphics]]. The main approaches used for this may be classified into three basic types: geometric, physical, and particle/energy.

== Background ==

Most models of cloth are based on "particles" of mass connected in some manner of mesh. [[Newtonian Physics]] is used to model each particle through the use of a "black box" called a [[physics engine]]. This involves using the basic law of motion (Newton's Second Law):

: &lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = m \vec{a}&lt;/math&gt;

In all of these models, the goal is to find the position and shape of a piece of fabric using this basic equation and several other methods.

== Geometric methods ==

Weil pioneered the first of these, the geometric technique, in 1986.&lt;ref name="tutorial"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/5445/cloth.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+09:48:40 Tutorial on Cloth Modeling]&lt;/ref&gt; His work was focused on approximating the look of cloth by treating cloth like a collection of cables and using [[Hyperbolic cosine]] (catenary) curves. Because of this, it is not suitable for dynamic models but works very well for stationary or single-frame renders.&lt;ref name="tutorial"/&gt; This technique creates an underlying shape out of single points; then, it parses through each set of three of these points and maps a catenary curve to the set. It then takes the lowest out of each overlapping set and uses it for the render.

== Physical methods ==

The second technique treats cloth like a grid work of particles connected to each other by springs. Whereas the geometric approach accounted for none of the inherent stretch of a woven material, this physical model accounts for stretch (tension), stiffness, and weight:

: &lt;math&gt;E(Particle_{i,j}) = k_{s}E_{s,i,j} + k_{b}E_{b,i,j} + k_{g}E_{g,i,j}&lt;/math&gt;

* s terms are elasticity (by [[Hooke's Law]])
* b terms are bending
* g terms are gravity (see [[standard gravity|Acceleration due to gravity]])

Now we apply the basic principle of [[mechanical equilibrium]] in which all bodies seek lowest energy by differentiating this equation to find the minimum energy.

== Particle/energy methods ==

The last method is more complex than the first two. The particle technique takes the physical methods a step further and supposes that we have a network of particles interacting directly. Rather than springs, the energy interactions of the particles are used to determine the cloth’s shape. An energy equation that adds onto the following is used:

: &lt;math&gt;U_{Total} = U_{Repel} + U_{Stretch} + U_{Bend} + U_{Trellis} + U_{Gravity}&lt;/math&gt;

* The energy of repelling is an artificial element we add to prevent cloth from intersecting itself.
* The energy of stretching is governed by [[Hooke's law]] as with the Physical Method.
* The energy of bending describes the stiffness of the fabric
* The energy of trellising describes the shearing of the fabric (distortion within the plane of the fabric)
* The energy of gravity is based on [[standard gravity|acceleration due to gravity]]

Terms for energy added by any source can be added to this equation, then derive and find minima, which generalizes our model. This allows for modelling cloth behavior under any circumstance, and since the cloth is treated as a collection of particles its behavior can be described with the dynamics provided in our physics engine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8924">The term '''corporate donation''' refers to any financial contribution made by a corporation to another organization that furthers the contributor's own objectives. Two major kinds of such donations deserve specific consideration, charitable as well as political donations.

==Charitable donations==
Corporations give to charitable causes, either because of the personal convictions of influential leaders within the corporation, or more commonly to help establish the public perception that the corporation is a good [[Corporate citizenship|corporate citizen]].

===Types===
Corporate charitable giving can be divided into direct cash and non-cash contributions. Direct cash giving comes from corporate headquarters, regional offices, or company sponsored foundations. Examples of direct cash contributions include:
* Community grants to support local community efforts or nonprofits - 100% of Fortune 500 companies provide some form of community grant or sponsor at least one fundraising event.&lt;ref name=GUSA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givingusareports.org/products/GivingUSA_2011_ExecSummary_Print.pdf|title=givingusareports.org|website=www.givingusareports.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Matching gift]]s - Corporate donations to nonprofits as a match to employee giving. Approximately 65% of Fortune 500 companies offer these programs.&lt;ref name=DTD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doublethedonation.com/FAQ/OurDatabase.php|title=Double the Donation Customer Support|website=www.doublethedonation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Volunteer grant]]s - Giving to nonprofits in recognition of employee-volunteer service to that organization. Approximately 40% of Fortune 500 companies offer these programs.&lt;ref name=DTD/&gt;

Non-cash contributions are contributions of equipment, supplies or time, and do not include cash contributions. Examples of non-cash contributions include:
* Donation of new or used equipment or supplies, such as computers and other electronic equipment, office supplies, and targeted supplies such as clothing, canned goods, or paper products.
* Use of organizational services/facilities, such as financial and administrative support, computer services, printing, mailing or copying, or targeted professional services and support.
* Application of professional services, such as tax and financial advice, strategic planning and organizational development, graphic arts and copy writing, and legal assistance.

Non-cash contributions can also be interpreted through an organization's policy to allow employees [[paid time off]] when performing volunteer work.

===Annual charitable giving figures===
Total corporate cash donations in 2010 are estimated to be $15.29 billion in the United States.&lt;ref name=GUSA/&gt; Of that, ~80%-85% came from corporate grants and sponsorship of fundraising events while ~15%-20% or $2–$3 billion came from corporate [[matching gifts]] and [[volunteer grants]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corporatephilanthropy.org/pdfs/giving_in_numbers/GivinginNumbers2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political donations ==

There is a wide range of models of [[political finance]] in democracies; political donations by individuals and organizations are one of many sources of funding.

=== United States ===

In the US, corporations are prohibited from making expenditures to influence federal elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/fecfeca.shtml#Contribution_Limits|title=Home - FEC.gov|website=FEC.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=52 U.S. Code § 30118 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30118 |website=Legal Information Institute |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar restrictions exist in many state elections and have been upheld by the US Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-election-idUSBREA360XH20140407|title=Supreme Court declines to hear Iowa campaign finance challenge|date=7 April 2014|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations may make donations to [[Political Action Committees]] (PACs); PACs generally have strict limits on their ability to advocate on behalf of specific parties or candidates, or even to coordinate their activities with political campaigns. PACs are subject to disclosure requirements at the federal and state levels. The ability of corporations to engage in such independent expenditures has been subject to intense debate after the US Supreme Court struck down, on free-speech grounds, limits in [[Citizens United v. FEC]], a case involving the creation of a film critical of [[Hillary Clinton]] by a [[nonprofit corporation]].

Donations are closely tracked by a number of organizations, including the [[Center for Responsive Politics]] (opensecrets.org). Such organizations often group donations under specific corporations, but such donations refer to contributions from individuals and PACs associated with the corporation, not "corporate donations".

Corporate donations to PACs and Super PACs are a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] issue and subject to intense political debate in the US. Proponents of tighter regulations of political donations by corporations argue&lt;ref&gt;Warwick Smith, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/11/political-donations-corrupt-democracy-in-ways-you-might-not-realise Political donations corrupt democracy]&lt;/ref&gt; that corporate donations corrupt democracy. Other research suggests that post-election lobbying and access to politicians, rather than campaign contributions, shapes and reinforces policy decision by politicians&lt;ref&gt;John R. Wright: [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8975727&amp;fileId=S0003055400192573 Contributions, Lobbying, and Committee Voting in the U.S. House of Representatives], American Political Science Review 84(2), 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===

In Germany, both individuals and corporations may make unlimited contributions to political parties. These contributions are partially tax exempt and partially matched by government funds; contributions of more than 10000 Euros are reportable.

During the 2013 election cycle in Germany, corporations and other organizations made direct contributions to German political parties in the amount of at least 24.2 million Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article138941661/Parteispenden-Wer-von-wem-wie-viel-Geld-bekommt.html|title=Parteispenden – Welche Unternehmen wem wie viel zahlen - WELT|website=DIE WELT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to public subsidies of political parties and membership dues, such donations in Germany generally represent about 15% of the total revenue of major political parties; see [[Party finance in Germany]].

Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey have no limits on either contributions for parliamentary elections or on spending on such elections; in Belgium, Canada, Chile, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Poland, and Slovenia, there are limits on both contributions and spending; Austria, Hungary, Italy, New Zealand, Slovakia, the United Kingdom have no limits on contributions but do have limits on spending; Finland and the United States have limits on contributions but not on spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/how-our-campaign-finance-system-compares-other-countries|title=How Our Campaign Finance System Compares to Other Countries|last=Waldman|first=Paul|publisher=prospect.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Customs war''', also known as a ''toll war'' or ''tariff war'', is a type of economic conflict between two or more states. In order to pressure one of the states, the other raises taxes or [[tariff]]s for some of the products of that state. As a reprisal, the latter state may also increase the tariffs.

One example of a modern tariff war occurred in the 1920s and 1930s between the [[Weimar Republic]] and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], in the [[German–Polish customs war]]. The Weimar Republic, led by [[Gustav Stresemann]] wanted to force Poland, by creating an economic crisis by increasing the tolls for coal and steel products developed there, to give up its territory. As a reprisal, the Poles increased toll rates for many German products. This led to fast development of the port of [[Gdynia]], which was the only way Poland could export its goods to Western Europe without having to transport them through Germany.

In September 1922 the [[Fordney–McCumber Tariff]] (named after [[Joseph Fordney]], chair of the [[House Ways and Means Committee]], and [[Porter McCumber]], chair of the [[Senate Finance Committee]]) was signed by U.S. President [[Warren G. Harding]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothgeb, 2001, 30-32&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, the tariff law raised the average American [[ad valorem]] tariff rate to 38 percent.

Trading partners complained immediately.  Those injured by World War I said that, without access by their exports to the American market, they would not be able to make payments to America on war loans.  But others saw that this tariff increase would have broader deleterious effects.  Democratic Representative [[Cordell Hull]] said, "Our foreign markets depend both on the efficiency of our production and the tariffs of countries in which we would sell.  Our own [high] tariffs are an important factor in each.  They injure the former and invite the latter."

Five years after the passage of the tariff, American trading partners had raised their own tariffs by a significant degree.  [[France]] raised its tariffs on [[automobile]]s from 45% to 100%, [[Spain]] raised tariffs on American goods by 40%, and Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] raised tariffs on wheat.&lt;ref&gt;Rothgeb, 2001, 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; This customs war is often cited as one of the main causes of the [[Great Depression]].

The [[World Trade Organization]] was created to avoid customs wars, which are considered harmful to the world's economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7598">In [[Freudian psychology]], '''displacement''' ({{lang-de|Verschiebung}}, "shift, move") is an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[Defence mechanism|defence mechanism]] whereby the mind substitutes either a new aim or a new [[Object relations theory|object]] for goals felt in their original form to be dangerous or unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

A term originating with [[Sigmund Freud]],&lt;ref&gt;Salman Akhtar, ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (2009) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; displacement operates in the mind unconsciously, its [[transference]] of emotions, ideas, or wishes being most often used to allay anxiety in the face of aggressive or sexual impulses.

==Freud==

Freud initially saw displacement as a means of dream-distortion, involving a shift of emphasis from important to unimportant elements,&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; or the replacement of something by a mere illusion.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Freud called this “displacement of accent.” 

'''Displacement of object:''' Feelings that are connected with one person are displaced onto another person. A man who has had a bad day at the office, comes home and yells at his wife and children, is displacing his anger from workplace onto his family. Freud&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1913). Totem and taboo: Some points of agreement between the mental lives of savages and neurotics. Complete Works, 13: 1–162, London: Hogarth.&lt;/ref&gt; thought that when children have animal phobias, they may be displacing fears of their parents onto an animal. 

'''Displacement of attribution:''' A characteristic that one perceives in oneself but seems unacceptable is instead attributed to another person. This is essentially the mechanism of [[psychological projection]]; an aspect of the self is projected (displaced) onto someone else. Freud&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1927). The future of an illusion. ''Complete Works'', 21: 1–56. London: Hogarth.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that people commonly displace their own desires onto God’s will. 

'''Bodily displacements:''' A genital sensation may be experienced in the mouth (displacement upward) or an oral sensation may be experienced in the genitals (displacement downward). Novelist [[John Cleland]] in ‘’Fanny Hill’’&lt;ref&gt;Cleland, J. ''Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure''. Critical ed. by Peter Sabor, Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to the vagina as “the nethermouth.” Sexual attraction toward a human body can be displaced in [[sexual fetishism]], sometimes onto a particular body part like the foot or at other times onto an inanimate fetish object. 

Freud also saw displacement as occurring in jokes,&lt;ref&gt;''New Introductory Lectures'' p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in neuroses – the obsessional neurotic being especially prone to the technique of displacement onto the minute.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 120-1&lt;/ref&gt; When two or more displacements occurs towards the same idea, the phenomenon is called [[Condensation (psychology)|condensation]] (from the German ''Verdichtung'').

==The psychoanalytic mainstream==

Among Freud's mainstream followers, [[Otto Fenichel]] highlighted the displacement of [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], either through [[Postponement of affect|postponement]] or by redirection, or both.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, he considered that "in part the paths of displacement depend on the nature of the drives that are warded off".&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Berne]] in his first, psychoanalytic work, maintained that "some of the most interesting and socially useful displacements of [[libido]] occur when both the aim and the object are partial substitutions for the biological aim and object...[[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]".&lt;ref&gt;Berne, ''A Layman's Guide'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacan==

In 1957, [[Jacques Lacan]], inspired by an article by linguist [[Roman Jakobson]] on [[metaphor and metonymy]], argued that the unconscious has the structure of a language, linking displacement to the [[poetic function]] of [[metonymy]],&lt;ref&gt;David Macey, Introduction, Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Funadamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Condensation (psychology)|condensation]] to that of [[metaphor]].

As he himself put it, "in the case of ''Verschiebung'', 'displacement', the German term is closer to the idea of that veering off of signification that we see in metonymy, and which from its first appearance in Freud is represented as the most appropriate means used by the unconscious to foil censorship".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aggression==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}
The aggressive drive – known as [[mortido]] – may be displaced quite as much as the [[libido|libidinal]] - the sex drive. Business or athletic competition, or hunting, for instance, offer plentiful opportunities for the expression of displaced mortido.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

In such [[scapegoating]] behavior, aggression may be displaced onto people with little or no connection with what is causing anger or frustration. Some people punch [[cushion]]s when they are angry at friends; a college student may snap at his or her roommate when upset about an exam grade ... etc.

Displacement can also act in a what looks like a 'chain-reaction', with people unwittingly becoming both victims and perpetrators of displacement. For example, a man is angry with his boss, but he cannot express this properly, so he hits his wife. The wife, in turn, hits one of the children, possibly disguising this as a "punishment" ([[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]]).

[[Ego psychology]] sought to use displacement in child rearing, a dummy being used as a displaced target for toddler sibling rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;Selma H. Fraiberg, ''The Magic Years'' (New York 1987) p. 151-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transferential displacement==
The displacement of feelings and attitudes from past significant others onto the present-day analyst constitutes a central aspect of the transference, particularly in the case of the neurotic.&lt;ref&gt;P. Schwmeister, ''Less Legible Meaning'' (1999) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsidiary form of displacement ''within'' the transference occurs when the patient disguises transference references by applying them to an apparent third party or to themself.&lt;ref&gt;P. Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Later writers have objected that whereas Freud only described the displacement of sex into culture, for example, the converse – social conflict being displaced into sexuality – is also true.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Dollimore, ''Sexual Dissidence'' &lt;1991) p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10458">An '''edict of toleration''' is a declaration, made by a government or ruler and states, that members of a given [[religion]] will not be persecuted for engaging in their religious practices and traditions. The edict implies tacit acceptance of the religion rather than its endorsement by the ruling power.

== Edicts of toleration in history ==

===Ancient times===
*539 B.C. – The [[Cyrus Cylinder]], a clay document issued by Achaemenid [[Persia]]n monarch [[Cyrus the Great]] declaring the restoration of the cult of [[Marduk]] in [[Babylon]] and the restorations of the temples of many peoples, including the [[Jews]].
*311 A.D. – The [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] was issued in 311 by the Roman Tetrarchy of Galerius, Constantine and Licinius, officially ending the [[Diocletian]] persecution of Christianity.
*313 – Roman Emperors [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] that legalized Christianity across the whole [[Imperium Romanum|Empire]].
*361 or 362 - Julian the Apostate, Roman emperor, issued a new edict[[Julian (emperor)#Restoration of Paganism as state religion]] that legalized/ recognized all forms of Christianity, as well as Judaism and Paganism, across his empire.

===Middle Ages===
*1436 – The [[Compacts of Basel]] (valid for the [[Crown of Bohemia]], previously declared in 1420 and approved by the [[Council of Basle]] in 1433) were formally accepted by Catholics and Utraquists (moderate [[Hussites]]) at an assembly in Jihlava and agreed by King and Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], introducing a limited toleration and stating that "the word of God is to be freely and truthfully preached by the priests of the Lord, and by worthy deacons"

===Early modern period===
*1562 – The [[Edict of Saint-Germain]] was an edict of limited toleration issued by [[Catherine de' Medici]] (the [[regent]] for the young [[Charles IX of France]]) that ended insistent persecution of non-Catholics (mostly [[Huguenots]]).  The persecution was a result of the [[Concordat of Bologna]] (1516). A massacre of Huguenots a few weeks later began open hostilities in the French [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] (1562-1598).
*1568 – The [[Edict of Torda]] (or Turda), also known as the Patent of Toleration (Act of Religious Tolerance and Freedom of Conscience), was an attempt by King [[John II Sigismund Zápolya|John II Sigismund]] of [[Eastern Hungarian Kingdom|Hungary]] to guarantee religious freedom in his realm. Specifically, it broadened previous grants (to Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists) to include the [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Unitarian Church]], and allowed toleration (not legal guarantees) for other faiths.
* 1573 – The [[Warsaw Confederation]] made all Christian confessions equal in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]
* 1579 – The [[Union of Utrecht]] included a decree of toleration allowing personal freedom of religion. An additional declaration allowed provinces and cities that wished to remain Catholic to join the Union.
* 1598 – The [[Edict of Nantes]], issued by the [[King of France]], [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], was the formal religious settlement which ended the first era of the French Wars of Religion. The Edict granted to French [[Huguenots]] legal recognition as well as limited religious freedoms, including: freedom of public worship, the right of assembly, rights of admission to public offices and universities, and permission to maintain fortified towns. The Edict of Nantes, however, would be revoked in 1685 by Henry IV's grandson, [[Louis XIV]], who once again proclaimed Protestantism to be illegal in France through the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]].
* 1609 – The [[Letter of Majesty]] by King of Bohemia and Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]], valid for the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and [[Duchies of Silesia]], introducing freedom of religion and religious toleration for all (including non-privileged classes, i.e. peasants etc.)
* 21 April 1649 – [[Maryland Toleration Act]] in the early American colony [[Province of Maryland]], also known as the Act Concerning Religion, was passed by Maryland's colonial assembly mandating religious tolerance for Catholicism. It was the second law requiring religious tolerance in the [[British North American colonies]] and created the first legal limitations on [[hate speech]] in the world. The Calvert family, who founded Maryland partly as a refuge for [[English Catholics]], sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and those of other religions that did not conform to the dominant [[Anglicanism]] of Britain and her colonies. The Act was revoked in 1654, before being reinstated again, and finally, repealed permanently in 1692 following the [[Glorious Revolution]]. The Maryland Toleration Act influenced related laws in other colonies and was an important predecessor to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which enshrined religious freedom in American law over a century later.
*16 September 1664 – Edict of Toleration in the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]] (now in [[Germany]]), tolerance of the Protestant denominations with each other
*29 October 1685 – [[Edict of Potsdam]], for reform of Huguenots in Lutheran [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian Kingdom]]
*1689 – [[Parliament]] in [[England]] passes the [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]] protecting [[Protestants]] with [[Roman Catholics]] intentionally excluded
* 1692 – The [[Kangxi Emperor]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] issued the [[Chinese Rites controversy#Reception in China|Chinese Edict of Toleration]] on 22 March,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

*29 March 1712 – Tolerance Act of [[Ernst Casimir]] in [[Büdingen]]. It guaranteed ''vollkommene Gewissensfreiheit'' (complete [[freedom of conscience]]) and demanded in return, the civil authorities and subjects both in their homes to behave as honorable, decent and Christian. The real aim was to counteract the war and plague which had caused the population decline.
*17 June 1773 – Tolerance Edict of [[Catherine II]] of Russia, in response to domestic political disputes with the Muslim [[Tatars]]. In the tolerance edict, she promised the toleration of all religious denominations in the [[Russian Empire]], except for the large number of Jews who came under Russian rule after the [[First partition of Poland]].
*1781/82 – A [[Patent of Toleration]] and linked [[1782 Edict of Tolerance]] (for Jews) issued by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], extended religious freedom to non-Catholic Christians living in [[Habsburg lands]], including: Lutherans, Calvinists, and the Greek Orthodox. However, in the end, Joseph's rescinded his own toleration patent while on his deathbed.
*1784 – Tolerance Edict of Elector Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, meant toleration of Protestants in the [[Electorate of Trier]].
*29 November 1787 – The [[Edict of Versailles]], issued by [[Louis XVI]] of France, ended persecution of non-Catholics - including [[Huguenots]] and Jews.
*15 December 1791 [[Freedom of religion in the United States#The First Amendment|Freedom of Religion]] codified in the [[United States Bill of Rights|1st Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]]

===Late modern period===
*11 March 1812 – [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]] of Prussia, extended by the Prussian Jews Edict, the rights of Jews already in the old Prussian parts of the country eingebürgeten Jews.
*1839 – [[Edict of Toleration (Hawaii)]], which is issued by [[Kamehameha III]] to allow Catholic missionaries in addition to Protestants.
*21 March 1844 – [[Edict of Toleration 1844|Edict of Toleration]], seen as beginning the process of allowing [[Jews]] to settle in the [[Holy Land]]. It reduces punishments for apostasy from death.&lt;ref name="Sours"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Michael | last = Sours | title = The 1844 Ottoman 'Edict of Toleration' in Baha'i Secondary Literature |volume = 8 | issue = 3 | year = 1998 | journal = Journal of Baha'i Studies | pages = 53–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*30 March 1847 – Tolerance Edict of King [[Frederick William IV]] of Prussia- among other things, [[religious disaffiliation]] is allowed.

===20th century===
* 30 April 1905 – Edict of Toleration issued by Tsar [[Nicholas II]] of Russia gives legal status to religions not of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

The '''El Segundo blue''' (''Euphilotes battoides allyni'') is a [[butterfly]] local to a small dune ecosystem in [[Southern California]] that [[Abandoned village|used to be a community]] called [[Palisades del Rey, California|Palisades del Rey]], close to the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rare Butterflies at LAX|url=https://www.airportparkingmarket.co.uk/rare-butterflies-at-lax/|website=Airport Parking Market|publisher=Airport Parking Market|accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 it became a federally designated [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;Traci Watson:[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160421-butterflies-endangered-species-animals/ Rare Butterflies Flying High at Los Angeles Airport], [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], 21 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The El Segundo Blue Butterfly Habitat Preserve next to LAX exists to protect the species. There are only three colonies of this tiny butterfly still in existence.  The largest of these is on the grounds of LAX; a further colony exists on a site within the huge [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] El Segundo oil refinery complex,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Do|url=http://elsegundo.chevron.com/abouttherefinery/whatwedo/default.aspx|website=Chevron|publisher=Chevron|accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the smallest colony is an area of only a few square yards on a local beach. The butterfly lays its eggs on [[Eriogonum parvifolium|coast buckwheat]], which the adults also use as a [[nectar]] source.  Recently, some nearby beach cities such as [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] have replaced [[Aizoaceae|ice plant]] growth near the beaches with coast buckwheat, in order to provide the butterflies with more of their natural food source.

The '''environmental movement''' (sometimes referred to as the '''ecology movement'''), also including [[conservation movement|conservation]] and [[green politics]], is a diverse scientific, social, and [[political movement]] for addressing [[environmental issue]]s. [[Environmentalist]]s advocate the [[sustainable]] management of resources and [[stewardship]] of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] through changes in public policy and individual behavior. In its recognition of humanity as a participant in (not enemy of) ecosystems, the movement is centered on [[ecology]], [[health]], and [[human rights]].

The environmental movement is an international movement, represented by a range of organizations, from the large to [[grassroots]] and varies from country to country. Due to its large membership, varying and strong beliefs, and occasionally speculative nature, the environmental movement is not always united in its goals. The movement also encompasses some other movements with a more specific focus, such as the [[climate movement]]. At its broadest, the movement includes private citizens, professionals, religious devotees, politicians, scientists, [[nonprofit organization]]s and individual advocates.

==History==                                           
===Early awareness===
[[File:StRolloxChemical 1831.jpg|thumb|Levels of air pollution rose during the [[Industrial Revolution]], sparking the first modern environmental laws to be passed in the mid-19th century]]
Early interest in the environment was a feature of the [[Romantic movement]] in the early 19th century. The poet [[William Wordsworth]] had travelled extensively in the [[Lake District]] and wrote that it is a "sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wordsworth|first=William|authorlink=William Wordsworth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idlAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Guide+through+the+District+of+the+Lakes%E2%80%99&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=sort%20of%20national%20property%20in%20which%20every%20man%20has%20a%20right%20and%20interest%20who%20has%20an%20eye%20to%20perceive%20and%20a%20heart%20to%20enjoy&amp;f=false|title=A guide through the district of the lakes in the north of England with a description of the scenery, &amp;c. for the use of tourists and residents|edition=5th|location=Kendal, England|publisher=Hudson and Nicholson|year=1835|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the environmental movement lay in the response to increasing levels of [[smoke]] [[pollution]] in the [[atmosphere]] during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in [[history of coal mining|coal consumption]] gave rise to an unprecedented level of [[air pollution]] in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial [[chemical]] discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste.&lt;ref name="Donora"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ametsoc.org/sloan/cleanair/ |title=History of the Clean Air Act |accessdate=2006-02-14 |first=James R. |last=Fleming |author2=Bethany R. Knorr |publisher=American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under increasing political pressure from the urban middle-class, the first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of Britain's [[Alkali Acts]], passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution ([[gaseous]] [[hydrochloric acid]]) given off by the [[Leblanc process]], used to produce [[soda ash]].

===Conservation movement===
{{Main article|Conservation movement}}
[[File:Sir William Schlich07.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Students from the forestry school at [[Oxford]], on a visit to the forests of Saxony in the year 1892]]
The modern [[conservation movement]] was first manifested in the forests of India, with the practical application of scientific conservation principles. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that the human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many [[Epidemiology|medico-topographical]] reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in [[British India]] through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stebbing |first=E.P |author-link=Edward Percy Stebbing |year=1922 |title=The Forests of India |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Forests_of_India.html?id=9cAHAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |volume=1 |pages=72–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WDYlNljAP5AC|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|first=Greg|last=Barton|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48|isbn=9781139434607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the government under [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well the [[United States]]. In 1860, the Department banned the use [[shifting cultivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|title=A life for forestry|last=MUTHIAH|first=S. |date=5 November 2007|work=Metro Plus Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-03-09|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Francis Cleghorn|Dr. Hugh Cleghorn]]'s 1861 manual, ''The forests and gardens of South India'', became the definitive work on the subject and was widely used by forest assistants in the subcontinent.&lt;ref name="Cleghorn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

Sir [[Dietrich Brandis]] joined the British service in 1856 as superintendent of the teak forests of Pegu division in eastern [[Myanmar|Burma]]. During that time Burma's [[teak]] forests were controlled by militant [[Karen people|Karen]] tribals. He introduced the "taungya" system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=KFS |year=1968 |title=Agro-silviculture (the taungya system) |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Agri_silviculture_the_taungya_system.html?id=44smPw8a594C&amp;redir_esc=y |volume=Bulletin no. 1 |publisher=University of Ibadan / Dept. of Forestry }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Karen villagers provided labour for clearing, planting and weeding teak plantations. He formulated new forest legislation and helped establish research and training institutions. The Imperial Forestry School at [[Dehradun]] was founded by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weil |first1=Benjamin |year=2006 |chapter= |chapterurl= |title=Conservation, Exploitation, and Cultural Change in the Indian Forest Service, 1875-1927 |jstor=3986234 |journal=Environmental History |series= |edition= |volume=11| issue =  2 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gadgil |first1=Madhav |author-link1=Madhav Gadgil |last2=Guha |first2=Ramachandra |author-link2=Ramachandra Guha |year=1993 |title=This Fissured Land: An Ecological History of India |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/This_Fissured_Land.html?id=Jmr9n7aoRR4C&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of environmental protection societies===
The late 19th century saw the formation of the first wildlife conservation societies.
The zoologist [[Alfred Newton]] published a series of investigations into the ''Desirability of establishing a 'Close-time' for the preservation of indigenous animals'' between 1872 and 1903. His advocacy for legislation to protect animals from hunting during the mating season led to the formation of the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds|Plumage League]] (later the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) in 1889.&lt;ref name="milestones"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/milestones.asp |title=Milestones  |publisher=''RSPB'' |accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society acted as a [[advocacy group|protest group]] campaigning against the use of [[great crested grebe]] and [[black-legged kittiwake|kittiwake]] skins and feathers in [[fur clothing]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/index.asp |title=History of the RSPB |publisher=''RSPB'' |accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society attracted growing support from the suburban middle-classes,&lt;ref name="milestones"/&gt; and influenced the passage of the [[Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869|Sea Birds Preservation Act]] in 1869 as the first nature protection law in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3540740023|title=Coastal Dunes: Ecology and Conservation|author=G. Baeyens, M. L. Martinez|year=2007|page=282|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/humberside/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_9383000/9383787.stm|title=Protecting seabirds at Bempton Cliffs | work=BBC News | first=Jo|last=Makel|date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of the century from 1850 to 1950, however, the primary environmental cause was the mitigation of air pollution. The [[Environmental Protection UK|Coal Smoke Abatement Society]] was formed in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir [[William Blake Richmond]], frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke.

[[File:John Ruskin - Portrait - Project Gutenberg eText 17774.jpg|left|thumb|[[John Ruskin]] an influential thinker who articulated the Romantic ideal of environmental protection and conservation]]
Systematic and general efforts on behalf of the environment only began in the late 19th century; it grew out of the amenity movement in Britain in the 1870s, which was a reaction to [[industrialization]], the growth of cities, and worsening air and [[water pollution]]. Starting with the formation of the [[Commons Preservation Society]] in 1865, the movement championed rural preservation against the encroachments of industrialisation. [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Robert Hunter]], solicitor for the society, worked with [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], [[Octavia Hill]], and [[John Ruskin]] to lead a successful campaign to prevent the construction of railways to carry slate from the quarries, which would have ruined the unspoilt valleys of [[Newlands Valley|Newlands]] and [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]]. This success led to the formation of the Lake District Defence Society (later to become The Friends of the Lake District).&lt;ref name=vc&gt;[http://www.visitcumbria.com/rawnsley.htm "Canon Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806070246/http://www.visitcumbria.com/rawnsley.htm |date=6 August 2014 }}, Visitcumbria.com, accessed 17 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893 Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley agreed to set up a national body to coordinate environmental conservation efforts across the country; the "[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]]" was formally inaugurated in 1894.&lt;ref name=t94&gt;"A Proposed National Trust", ''The Times'', 17 July 1894, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation obtained secure footing through the 1907 National Trust Bill, which gave the trust the status of a statutory corporation.&lt;ref&gt;"Parliamentary Committees", ''The Times'', 26 July 1907. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and the bill was passed in August 1907.&lt;ref name=act&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/servlet/file/store5/item740098/version1/National%20Trust%20Acts%201907-1971%20post%20Order%202005.pdf "An Act to incorporate and confer powers upon the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602185018/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/servlet/file/store5/item740098/version1/National%20Trust%20Acts%201907-1971%20post%20Order%202005.pdf |date=2 June 2012 }}, The National Trust, accessed 4 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

An early "Back-to-Nature" movement, which anticipated the romantic ideal of modern environmentalism, was advocated by intellectuals such as [[John Ruskin]], [[William Morris]], and [[Edward Carpenter]], who were all against [[consumerism]], [[pollution]] and other activities that were harmful to the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Peter C. (1988). ''Early Green Politics'', Brighton, Harvester Press, pgs. 15-19, and [[Derek Wall|Wall, Derek]], (1994) ''Green History: A Reader.'' London, Routledge, pgs. 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was a reaction to the urban conditions of the industrial towns, where sanitation was awful, pollution levels intolerable and housing terribly cramped. Idealists championed the rural life as a mythical [[Utopia]] and advocated a return to it. John Ruskin argued that people should return to a ''small piece of English ground, beautiful, peaceful, and fruitful. We will have no steam engines upon it . . . we will have plenty of flowers and vegetables . . . we will have some music and poetry; the children will learn to dance to it and sing it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Back_to_the_Land.html?id=JcvZAAAAMAAJ|title=Back to the Land: The Pastoral Impulse in England, 1880-1914|first=Jan|last=Marsh|year=1982|publisher=Quartet Books|isbn=9780704322769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical ventures in the establishment of small cooperative farms were even attempted and old rural traditions, without the "taint of manufacture or the canker of artificiality", were enthusiastically revived, including the [[Morris dance]] and the [[maypole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1983/1215/121523.html|title='Back to nature' movement nothing new - dates back to 1880|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Walden Thoreau.jpg|thumb|right|Original title page of ''[[Walden]]'' by [[Henry David Thoreau]]]]
The movement in the [[United States]] began in the late 19th century, out of concerns for protecting the natural resources of the West, with individuals such as [[John Muir]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] making key philosophical contributions. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book ''[[Walden]]'', which argues that people should become intimately close with nature. Muir came to believe in nature's inherent right, especially after spending time hiking in [[Yosemite Valley]] and studying both the ecology and geology. He successfully lobbied congress to form [[Yosemite National Park]] and went on to set up the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of nature were to become the bedrock of modern environmentalism. However, the early movement in the U.S. developed with a contradiction; preservationists like [[John Muir]] wanted land and nature set aside for its own sake, and conservationists, such as [[Gifford Pinchot]] (appointed as the first Chief of the [[US Forest Service]] from 1905-1910), wanted to manage natural resources for human use.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, environmental ideas continued to grow in popularity and recognition. Efforts were beginning to be made to save the wildlife, particularly the [[American bison]]. The death of the last [[passenger pigeon]] as well as the endangerment of the American bison helped to focus the minds of conservationists and popularize their concerns. In 1916 the [[National Park Service]] was founded by US President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Pioneers of the movement called for more efficient and professional management of natural resources. They fought for reform because they believed the destruction of forests, fertile soil, minerals, wildlife and water resources would lead to the downfall of society.&lt;ref name="Culture Wars"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=Roger|title=Culture wars: an encyclopedia of issues, viewpoints, and voices|year=2010|publisher=M.E. Sharpe, Inc|isbn=0-7656-1761-7|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group that has been the most active in recent years is the [[climate movement]].

The U.S movement began to take off after [[World War II]] as people began to recognize the costs of environmental negligence, disease, and the expansion of air and water pollution through the occurrence of several environmental disasters that occurred post-World War II. [[Aldo Leopold]] wrote "[[A Sand County Almanac]]" in the 1940s. He believed in a land ethic that recognized that maintaining the "beauty, integrity, and health of natural systems" as a moral and ethical imperative.

Another major literary force in the promotion of the environmental movement was [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' about declining bird populations due to [[DDT]], an insecticide, pollution and man's attempts to control nature through use of synthetic substances. Her core message for her readers, was to identify the complex and fragile ecosystem and the threats facing the people. In 1958 Carson started to work on her last book, with an idea that nature needs human protection. Her influence was radioactive  fallout, smog, food additives, and pesticide use. Carson’s main focus was on pesticides, which led her to identify nature as fragile and the use of technology dangerous to humans and other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed: 1945 to the present|last=Hunt|first=Michael H.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780199371020|location=New York, New York|pages=215–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earth Day 2007 at City College San Diego.JPG|thumb|right|[[Earth Day]] 2007 at City College, San Diego]]
The first [[Earth Day]] was celebrated on 22 April 1970. Its founder, former Wisconsin Senator [[Gaylord Nelson]], was inspired to create this day of environmental education and awareness after seeing the oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara in 1969. [[Greenpeace]] was created in 1971 as an organization that believed that political advocacy and legislation were ineffective or inefficient solutions and supported non-violent action. 1980 saw the creation of [[Earth First!]], a group with an [[Ecocentrism|ecocentric]] view of the world – believing in equality between the rights of humans to flourish, the rights of all other species to flourish and the rights of life-sustaining systems to flourish.&lt;ref name="Culture Wars" /&gt;

In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, several events illustrated the magnitude of environmental damage caused by humans. In 1954, a [[hydrogen bomb]] test at [[Bikini Atoll]] exposed the 23 man crew of the Japanese fishing vessel ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon 5]]'' to radioactive fallout. In 1967 the oil tanker {{SS|Torrey Canyon||2}} ran aground off the coast of [[Cornwall]], and in 1969 oil spilled from an offshore well in California's [[Santa Barbara Channel]]. In 1971, the conclusion of a lawsuit in [[Japan]] drew international attention to the effects of decades of [[mercury poisoning]] on the people of [[Minamata]].&lt;ref&gt;Most of the information in this section comes from [[John McCormick (political scientist)|John McCormick]], ''The Global Environmental Movement'', London: John Wiley, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, emerging scientific research drew new attention to existing and hypothetical threats to the environment and humanity. Among them were [[Paul R. Ehrlich]], whose book ''[[The Population Bomb]]'' (1968) revived [[Thomas Malthus|Malthusian]] concerns about the impact of exponential population growth. Biologist [[Barry Commoner]] generated a debate about growth, affluence and "flawed technology." Additionally, an association of scientists and political leaders known as the [[Club of Rome]] published their report ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in 1972, and drew attention to the growing pressure on natural resources from human activities.

Meanwhile, technological accomplishments such as [[nuclear proliferation]] and photos of the [[Earth]] from [[outer space]] provided both new insights and new reasons for concern over Earth's seemingly small and unique place in the universe.

In 1972, the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] was held in [[Stockholm]], and for the first time united the representatives of multiple governments in discussion relating to the state of the global environment. This conference led directly to the creation of government environmental agencies and the [[UN Environment Program]].

By the mid-1970s anti-nuclear activism had moved beyond local protests and politics to gain a wider appeal and influence.  Although it lacked a single co-ordinating organization the [[anti-nuclear movement]]'s efforts gained a great deal of attention, especially in the [[United Kingdom]] and United States.&lt;ref name=eleven&gt;Walker, J.

Since the 1970s, public awareness, [[environmental science]]s, [[ecology]], and technology have advanced to include modern focus points like [[ozone]] depletion, [[global warming|global climate change]], [[acid rain]], [[mutation breeding]], [[genetically modified crops]] and [[genetically modified livestock]]. With mutation breeding, crop cultivars were created by exposing seeds to chemicals or radiation. Many of these cultivars are still being used today. Genetically modified plants and animals are said by some environmentalists to be inherently bad because they are unnatural. Others point out the possible benefits of GM crops such as water conservation through corn modified to be less "thirsty" and decreased pesticide use through insect - resistant crops. They also point out that some genetically modified livestock have accelerated growth which means there are shorter production cycles which again results in a more efficient use of feed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-31604233|title=Is the world ready for GM animals?|first=Paul|last=Rincon|date=25 February 2015|accessdate=16 August 2018|website=Bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Besides genetically modified crops and livestock, [[synthetic biology]] is also on the rise and environmentalists argue that these also contain risks, if these organisms were ever to end up in nature. This, as unlike with genetically modified organisms, synthetic biology even uses [[base pairs]] that do not exist in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/synthetic_biology_biodiversity_FB15_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=FUTURE BRIEF : Synthetic biology and biodiversity|date=September 2016|website=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{Main article|Environmental movement in the United States}}
Beginning in the [[conservation movement]] at the beginning of the 20th century, the contemporary environmental movement's roots can be traced back to [[Murray Bookchin]]'s ''[[Our Synthetic Environment]]'', [[Paul R. Ehrlich]]'s [[The Population Bomb]], and  [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]''. American environmentalists have campaigned against [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[nuclear power]] in 1960s and 1970s, [[acid rain]] in the 1980s, [[ozone depletion]] and [[deforestation]] in the 1990s, and most recently [[climate change]] and [[global warming]].

The United States passed many pieces of environmental legislation in the 1970s, such as the [[Clean Water Act]], the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], the [[Endangered Species Act]], and the [[National Environmental Policy Act]]. These remain as the foundations for current environmental standards.

==Latin America==

After the [[International Environmental Conference in Stockholm]] in 1972 Latin American officials returned with a high hope of growth and protection of the fairly untouched natural resources. Governments spent millions of dollars, and created departments and pollution standards. However, the outcomes have not always been what officials had initially hoped. Activists  blame this on growing urban populations and industrial growth. Many Latin American countries have had a large inflow of immigrants that are living in substandard housing. Enforcement of the pollution standards is lax and penalties are minimal; in Venezuela, the largest penalty for violating an environmental law is 50,000 [[Venezuelan bolívar|bolivar]] fine ($3,400) and 3 days in jail. In the 1970s or 1980s many Latin American countries were transitioning from military dictatorships to democratic governments.&lt;ref name="Latin America"&gt;{{cite news|last=Figdor|first=Carrie|title=Latin America's Environmental Movement Seen as Well-Meaning but Inadequate|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-24/news/mn-10121_1_latin-america|accessdate=20 February 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=24 July 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
{{see also|Environmental issues in Brazil#Solutions and policies}}
In 1992, Brazil came under scrutiny with the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil has a history of little environmental awareness. It has the highest [[biodiversity]] in the world and also the highest amount of habitat destruction. One-third of the world's forests lie in Brazil, and they have the largest river, [[Amazon River|The Amazon]], and the largest rainforest, the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. The people have raised funds to create state parks and increase the consciousness of people who have destroyed forests and polluted waterways. They have several organizations that have fronted the environmental movement. The Blue Wave Foundation was created in 1989 and has partnered with advertising companies to promote national education campaigns to keep Brazil's beaches clean. Funatura was created in 1986 and is a wildlife sanctuary program. [[Pro-Natura International]] is a private environmental organization created in 1986.&lt;ref name=Brazil&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooke|first=Elizabeth Heilman|title=As Forests Fall, Environmental Movement Rises in Brazil|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/02/news/as-forests-fall-environmental-movement-rises-in-brazil.html|accessdate=20 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 June 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
In 1952 the [[Great London Smog]] episode killed thousands of people and led the UK to create the first Clean Air Act in 1956. In 1957 the first major nuclear accident occurred in Windscale in northern England. The [[Torrey Canyon oil spill|supertanker ''Torrey Canyon'' ran aground]] off the coast of [[Cornwall]] in 1967 causing the first major oil leak that killed marine life along the coast. In 1972, in Stockholm, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment created the [[UN Environment Programme]]. The EU's environmental policy was formally founded by a [[European Council]] declaration and the first five-year environment programme was adopted. The main idea of the declaration was that prevention is better than the cure and the polluter should pay. 1979 saw the partial meltdown of [[Three Mile Island]] in the USA.

In the 1980s the green parties that were created a decade before began to have some political success.. In 1986, there was a nuclear accident in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]], Ukraine. The end of the 1980s and start of the 1990s saw the fall of communism across central and Eastern Europe, the fall of the [Berlin Wall], and the Union of East and West Germany. In 1992 there was a UN summit held in Rio de Janeiro where [[Agenda 21]] was adopted. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] was created in 1997 which set specific targets and deadlines to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. In the early 2000s activists believed that environmental policy concerns were overshadowed by energy security, globalism, and terrorism.&lt;ref name=Europe&gt;{{cite web |title=Celebrating Europe and its environment |url= http://www.eea.europa.eu/environmental-time-line |publisher=European Environment Agency |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==

===Middle East===
The environmental movement is reaching the less developed world with different degrees of success. The [[Arab world]], including the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], has different adaptations of the environmental movement. Countries on the [[Persian Gulf]] have high incomes and rely heavily on the large amount of energy resources in the area. Each country in the Arab world has varying combinations of low or high amounts of natural resources and low or high amounts of labor.

The [[League of Arab States]] has one specialized sub-committee, of 12 standing specialized subcommittee in the Foreign Affairs Ministerial Committees, which deals with Environmental Issues. Countries in the League of Arab States have demonstrated an interest in environmental issue, on paper some environmental activists have doubts about the level of commitment to environmental issues;; being a part of the world community may have obliged these countries to portray concern for the environment. Initial level of environmental awareness may be the creation of a ministry of the environment. The year of establishment of a ministry is also indicative of level of engagement. Saudi Arabia was the first to establish environmental law in 1992 followed by Egypt in 1994. Somalia is the only country without environmental law. In 2010 the Environmental Performance Index listed Algeria as the top Arab country at 42 of 163; Morocco was at 52 and Syria at 56. The [[Environmental Performance Index]] measures the ability of a country to actively manage and protect their environment and the health of their citizens. A weighted index is created by giving 50% weight for environmental health objective (health) and 50% for ecosystem vitality (ecosystem); values range from 0-100. No Arab countries were in the top quartile, and 7 countries were in the lowest quartile.&lt;ref name="Arab world"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Djoundourian|first=Salpie|title=Environmental movement in the Arab world|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|date=2011-08-01|volume=13|issue=4|pages=743–758|doi=10.1007/s10668-011-9287-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea and Taiwan===
South Korea and Taiwan experienced similar growth in industrialization from 1965-1990 with few environmental controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nongovernmental organizations and environmental protests: Impacts in East Asia (chapter 7 of Routledge Handbook of Environment and Society in Asia)|last = Wu and Wen|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-415-65985-7|location = London|pages = 105–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea's [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] and [[Nakdong River]] were so polluted by unchecked dumping of industrial waste that they were close to being classified as biologically dead. Taiwan's formula for balanced growth was to prevent industrial concentration and encourage manufacturers to set up in the countryside. This led to 20% of the farmland being polluted by industrial waste and 30% of the rice grown on the island was contaminated with heavy metals. Both countries had spontaneous environmental movements drawing participants from different classes. Their demands were linked with issues of employment, occupational health, and agricultural crisis. They were also quite militant; the people learned that protesting can bring results. The polluting factories were forced to make immediate improvements of the conditions or pay compensation to victims. Some were even forced to shut down or move locations. The people were able to force the government to come out with new restrictive rules on toxins, industrial waste, and air pollution. All of these new regulations caused the migration of those polluting industries from Taiwan and South Korea to China and other countries in Southeast Asia with more relaxed environmental laws.&lt;ref name=Asia&gt;{{cite web|last=Bello|first=Walden|title=The Environmental Movement in the Global South|url=http://www.tni.org/archives/act/17458|work=Transnational Institute|publisher=Environmental Justice|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
China's environmental movement is characterized by both the rise of environmental NGOs and policy advocacy and spontaneous alliances and protests that often only occur at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fengshi Wu|date=2009|title="Environmental Activism and Civil Society Development in China: 15 Years in Review,"|publisher=Harvard-Yenching Institute Working Paper Series|url=http://www.harvard-yenching.org/sites/harvard-yenching.org/files/featurefiles/WU%20Fengshi_Environmental%20Civil%20Society%20in%20China2.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental protests in China are increasingly expanding their scope of concerns, calling for broader participation "in the name of the public." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Christoph Steinhardt|author2=Fengshi Wu |date=2016|title="In the Name of the Public: Environmental Protest and the Changing Landscape of Popular Contention in China"|journal=The China Journal|volume=75|pages=61-82|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/684010#fn1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese have realized the ability of riots and protests to have success and had led to an increase in disputes in China by 30% since 2005 to more than 50,000 events. Protests cover topics such as environmental issues, [[land consumption|land loss]], income, and political issues. They have also grown in size from about 10 people or fewer in the mid-1990s to 52 people per incident in 2004. China has more relaxed environmental laws than other countries in Asia, so many polluting factories have relocated to China causing [[pollution in China]]. 

[[Water pollution]], [[water scarcity]], [[soil pollution]], [[soil degradation]], and [[desertification]] are issues currently in discussion in China. The [[groundwater table]] of the [[North China Plain]] is dropping by 1.5&amp;nbsp;m (5&amp;nbsp;ft) per year. This groundwater table occurs in the region of China that produces 40% of the country's grain.&lt;ref name=Asia /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guha|first=Ramachandra|title=The Last Liberal|publisher=Permanent Black|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Center for Legal Assistance to Pollution Victims|The Center for Legal Assistance to Pollution Victims]] works to confront legal issues associated with environmental justice by hearing court cases that expose the narratives of victims of environmental pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Guobin|date=|title=Environmental NGOs and Institutional Dynamics in China|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/341/|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=181|pages=44-66|doi=10.1017/S0305741005000032|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2018}}  As China continues domestic economic reforms and integration into global markets, there emerge new linkages between China's domestic environmental degradation and global econological crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{Fengshi Wu and Richard Edmonds. (2017). "Environmental degradation in China", Chapter 7 in Czes Tubilewicz (ed) Critical Issues in Contemporary China: Unity, Stability and Development (London and New York: Routledge), pp. 105-119.}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing the experiend of China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan reveals that the impact of environmental activism is heavily modified by domestic political context, particularly the level of integration of mass-based protests and policy advocacy NGOs. Hinted by the history of neighboring Japan and South Korea, the possible convergence of NGOs and anti-pollution protests will have significant implications for Chinese environmental politics in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{Fengshi Wu and Wen Bo (2014) "Nongovernmental Organizations and Environmental Protest: Impacts in East Asia," in Graeme Lang and Paul Harris ed. Routledge Handbook of Environment and Society in Asia: pp. 105-119 (London and New York: Routledge)}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Environmental and public health is an ongoing struggle within India. The first seed of an environmental movement in India was the foundation in 1964 of ''Dasholi Gram Swarajya Sangh'', a labour cooperative started by [[Chandi Prasad Bhatt]]. It was inaugurated by [[Sucheta Kriplani]] and founded on a land donated by Shyma Devi. This initiative was eventually followed up with the [[Chipko movement]] starting in 1974.

The most severe single event underpinning the movement was the [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal gas leakage]] on 3 December 1984. 40 tons of [[methyl isocyanate]] was released, immediately killing 2,259 people and ultimately affecting 700,000 citizens.

India has a national campaign against [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi Cola]] plants due to their practices of drawing ground water and contaminating fields with sludge. The movement is characterized by local struggles against intensive aquaculture farms. The most influential part of the environmental movement in India is the anti-dam movement. Dam creation has been thought of as a way for India to catch up with the West by connecting to the [[power grid]] with giant dams, coal or oil-powered plants, or nuclear plants. Jhola Aandolan a mass [[Social movement|movement]] is conducting as fighting against [[polyethylene]] carry bags uses and promoting cloth/jute/paper carry bags to protect environment &amp; [[nature]]. Activists in the Indian environmental movement consider global warming, sea levels rising, and glaciers retreating decreasing the amount of water flowing into streams to be the biggest challenges for them to face in the early twenty-first century.&lt;ref name=Asia /&gt;

[[Environmental science]] is the study of the interactions among the physical, chemical and biological components of the environment.

*[[Ecology]], or ecological science, is the scientific study of the distribution and abundance of living organisms and how these properties are affected by interactions between the organisms and their environment.

===Primary focus points===

The environmental movement is broad in scope and can include any topic related to the environment, conservation, and biology, as well as preservation of landscapes, flora, and fauna for a variety of purposes and uses. See [[List of environmental issues]]. When an act of violence is committed against someone or some institution in the name of environmental defense it is referred to as [[eco terrorism]].

*The [[conservation movement]] seeks to protect natural areas for [[sustainable consumption]], as well as traditional (hunting, fishing, trapping) and spiritual use.
* [[Environmental conservation]] is the process in which one is involved in conserving the natural aspects of the environment. Whether through [[reforestation]], [[recycling]], or pollution control, environmental conservation sustains the natural quality of life.
* [[Environmental health]] movement dates at least to [[Progressive Era]], and focuses on urban standards like clean water, efficient sewage handling, and stable population growth. Environmental health could also deal with [[nutrition]], [[preventive medicine]], [[aging]], and other concerns specific to human well-being. Environmental health is also seen as an indicator for the state of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], or an early warning system for what may happen to humans
* [[Environmental justice]] is a movement that began in the U.S. in the 1980s and seeks an end to [[environmental racism]] and prevent low-income and minority communities from an unbalanced exposure to highways, garbage dumps, and factories. The Environmental Justice movement seeks to link "social" and "ecological" environmental concerns, while at the same time preventing [[de facto]] racism, and classism. This makes it particularly adequate for the construction of labor-environmental alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a912901178 |title=Uniting to Win: Labor-Environmental Alliances |first= Dan |last=Jakopovich |publisher=Informaworld.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ecology movement]] could involve the [[Gaia theory (science)|Gaia Theory]], as well as [[Value of Earth]] and other interactions between humans, science, and responsibility.
* [[Bright green environmentalism]] is a currently popular sub-movement, which emphasizes the idea that through technology, good design and more thoughtful use of energy and resources, people can live responsible, sustainable lives while enjoying prosperity.

* [[Deep Ecology]] is an ideological spinoff of the ecology movement that views the diversity and integrity of the planetary ecosystem, in and for itself, as its primary value.
* The [[anti-nuclear movement]] opposes the use of various [[nuclear technology|nuclear technologies]]. The initial anti-nuclear objective was [[nuclear disarmament]] and later the focus began to shift to other issues, mainly opposition to the use of [[nuclear power]]. There have been many large anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and [[protest]]s. Major [[List of anti-nuclear groups|anti-nuclear groups]] include [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], [[Friends of the Earth]], [[Greenpeace]], [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]], and the [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service]].

==Environmental law and theory==

===Property rights===
Many environmental lawsuits question the legal rights of [[property]] owners, and whether the general public has a right to intervene with detrimental practices occurring on someone else's land.  Environmental law organizations exist all across the world, such as the [[Environmental Law and Policy Center]] in the [[midwestern]] [[United States]].

===Citizens' rights===
One of the earliest lawsuits to establish that citizens may sue for environmental and [[aesthetic]] harms was ''Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission'', decided in 1965 by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.  The case helped halt the construction of a power plant on [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]] in New York State.  See also [[United States environmental law]] and [[David Sive]], an attorney who was involved in the case.

===Nature's rights===
Christopher D. Stone's 1972 essay, "Should trees have standing?" addressed the question of whether natural objects themselves should have legal rights. In the essay, Stone suggests that his argument is valid because many current rightsholders (women, children) were once seen as objects.

==Environmental reactivism==
Numerous criticisms and ethical ambiguities have led to growing concerns about technology, including the use of potentially harmful [[pesticide]]s, water additives like [[fluoride]], and the extremely dangerous [[ethanol]]-processing plants.

[[NIMBY|NIMBY syndrome]] refers to public outcry caused by knee-jerk reaction to an unwillingness to be exposed to even necessary developments. Some serious [[biology|biologists]] and [[ecology|ecologists]] created the scientific [[ecology movement]] which would not confuse empirical data with visions of a desirable future world.

==Environmentalism today==
[[File:BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Composite images of Earth generated by NASA in 2001 (left) and 2002 (right)]]

Today, the sciences of [[ecology]] and [[environmental science]], in addition to any aesthetic goals, provide the basis of unity to some of the serious environmentalists. As more information is gathered in scientific fields, more scientific issues like [[biodiversity]], as opposed to mere aesthetics, are a concern to environmentalists. [[Conservation biology]] is a rapidly developing field.

In recent years, the environmental movement has increasingly focused on [[global warming]] as one of the top issues. As concerns about [[climate change]] moved more into the mainstream, from the connections drawn between global warming and [[Hurricane Katrina]] to [[Al Gore]]'s 2006 documentary film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', more and more environmental groups refocused their efforts. In the United States, 2007 witnessed the largest grassroots environmental demonstration in years, [[Step It Up 2007]], with rallies in over 1,400 communities and all 50 states for real global warming solutions.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Many religious organizations and individual churches now have programs and activities dedicated to environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gis.net/~rwe/links.html List of (incomplete) religious environmental organizations.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927003158/http://www.gis.net/~rwe/links.html |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious movement is often supported by interpretation of scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creationcare.org/resources/scripture.php|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20021124084848/http://www.creationcare.org/resources/scripture.php|deadurl=yes|title=EEN|date=24 November 2002|archivedate=24 November 2002|website=Creationcare.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[major religious groups]] are represented including Jewish, Islamic, Anglican, Orthodox, Evangelical, Zoroastrian, Christian and Catholic.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Radical environmentalism==
;{{Main article|Radical environmentalism}}

Radical environmentalism emerged from an [[ecocentrism]]-based frustration with the co-option of mainstream environmentalism. The radical environmental movement aspires to what scolar Christopher Manes calls "a new kind of environmental activism: iconoclastic, uncompromising, discontented with traditional conservation policy, at times illegal ..." Radical environmentalism presupposes a need to reconsider [[Western philosophy|Western]] ideas of religion and philosophy (including [[capitalism]], [[patriarchy]]&lt;ref name = ern/&gt;  and [[globalization]])&lt;ref name=jeff1&gt;[http://shiftshapers.gnn.tv/blogs/9306/A_Brief_Description_of_Radical_Environmentalism A Brief Description of Radical Environmentalism], [[Jeff Luers]], ''4 Struggle Magazine'', 26 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes through "resacralising" and reconnecting with nature.&lt;ref name=ern&gt;Manes, Christopher, 1990. ''Green Rage: Radical Environmentalism and the Unmaking of Civilization'', Boston: Little, Brown and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
Greenpeace represents an organisation with a radical approach, but has contributed in serious ways towards understanding of critical issues, and has a science-oriented core with radicalism as a means to media exposure. Groups like [[Earth First!]] take a much more radical posture. Some radical environmentalist groups, like Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]], [[Eco-terrorism|illegally sabotage or destroy]] [[infrastructural capital]].

==Criticisms==
{{see also|Environmental skepticism|Anti-environmentalism|Criticism of the environmental movement in the United States}}
Conservative critics of the movement characterize it as radical and misguided. Especially critics of the [[United States Endangered Species Act]], which has come under scrutiny lately, and the Clean Air Act, which they said conflict with private property rights, corporate profits and the nation's overall economic growth. Critics also [[Climate change denial|challenge the scientific evidence for global warming]]. They argue that the environmental movement has diverted attention from more pressing issues.&lt;ref name="Culture Wars" /&gt;

Also, while there is a greater consensus regarding the formal rights, due partly on diplomacy motives, the actual implementation process is much more complex.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23372">'''Garden waste''', or '''[[green waste]] dumping''' is the act of discarding or depositing garden waste somewhere it does not belong.    
 
[[Green waste|Garden waste]] is the accumulated plant matter from gardening activities which involve cutting or removing vegetation, i.e. cutting the lawn, weed removal, hedge trimming or pruning consisting of lawn clippings. leaf matter, wood and soil.&lt;ref name="Aarhus 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boldrin | first1 = A. | last2 = Christensen | first2 = T. | year = 2010 | title = Seasonal generation and composition of garden waste in Aarhus (Denmark) | doi = 10.1016/j.wasman.2009.11.031 | pmid = 20042325 | journal = Waste Management | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 551–557 | url = http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/seasonal-generation-and-composition-of-garden-waste-in-aarhus-denmark(4b0d9f5e-3ce8-4e63-ac0a-97fdd557b784).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition and volume of garden waste can vary from season to season and location to location. A study in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]], found that on average, garden waste generation per person ranged between 122&amp;nbsp;kg to 155&amp;nbsp;kg per year.&lt;ref name="Aarhus 2009"/&gt;

Garden waste may be used to create [[compost]] or [[mulch]], which can be used as a soil conditioner, adding valuable nutrients and building [[humus]]. The creation of compost requires a balance between, nitrogen, carbon, moisture and oxygen. Without the ideal balance, plant matter may take a long time to break down, drawing nitrogen from other sources, reducing nitrogen availability to existing vegetation which requires it for growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Bertoldi | first1 = M. | last2 = Vallini | first2 = G. | last3 = Pera | first3 = A. | year = 1983 | title = The Biology of Composting: a Review | doi = 10.1177/0734242x8300100118 | journal = Waste Management &amp; Research | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 157–176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of dumping garden waste is that it may contain seeds and plant parts that may grow ([[propagules]]), as well as increase fire fuel loads, disrupt visual amenity, accrue economic costs associated with the removal of waste as well as costs associated with the mitigation of associated impacts such as [[weed control]], forest fire.

==Cause==
There are strong links between weed invasion of natural areas and the proximity and density of housing.&lt;ref name="Another way forward"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rhodes | first1 = T | year = 2005 | title = Another way forward | doi = 10.1038/vital306-2c | journal = Vital | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The size and duration of the community have a direct relation to the density of weed infestation.&lt;ref name="Another way forward"/&gt; Of the various means in which migration of exotic species from gardens take place, such as vegetative dispersal of runners, wind born and fallen seed, garden waste dumping can play a significant role.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nakayama | first1 = J | year = 2010 | title = ChemInform Abstract: Chemistry of Inner Salts which Are Composed of (R2N)2C+- and -CX2- (X: S, Se) Ions | doi = 10.1002/chin.200226261 | journal = ChemInform | volume = 33 | issue = 26| pages = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of one North German study found that of the problematic population of [[Fallopia]], app. 29% originated from garden waste. Of a population of [[Heracleum mantegazzianum]], 18% was found by Schepker to be generated by garden waste (as cited by Kowarik &amp; von der Lippe, 2008) pg 24-25.

An Australia government publication suggest that some of the main reasons for the dumping of garden waste can be attributed to lack of care for the environment, convenience, or a reluctance to pay for the correct collection or disposal of the waste. (Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]. 2013). People dump garden waste to avoid disposal fees at [[landfill]] sites or because they do not want to spend the time or effort disposing of or recycling their waste properly. This activity is carried out by people in all parts of the community, from householders to businesses, such as professional landscapers and gardeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fabricius | first1 = K. | last2 = Logan | first2 = M. | last3 = Weeks | first3 = S. | last4 = Lewis | first4 = S. | last5 = Brodie | first5 = J. | year = 2016 | title = Changes in water clarity in response to river discharges on the Great Barrier Reef continental shelf: 2002–2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecss.2016.03.001 | journal = Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science | volume = 173 | issue = | pages = A1–A15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The spread of exotic vegetation can out-compete locally endemic vegetation, altering the composition and structure of an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qvenild | first1 = M. | last2 = Setten | first2 = G. | last3 = Skår | first3 = M. | year = 2014 | title = Politicising plants: Dwelling and invasive alien species in domestic gardens in Norway | doi = 10.1080/00291951.2013.870599 | journal = [[Norwegian Journal of Geography|Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift - Norwegian Journal of Geography]] | volume = 68 | issue = 1| pages = 22–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumping of garden waste in particular facilitates the spread of exotic vegetation into forest remnants via the introduction of seeds and propagules contained within the garden waste.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Common selection criteria for home gardeners when choosing plants are often based on ease of propagation, suitability to local environmental conditions and novelty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rusterholz | first1 = H. | last2 = Wirz | first2 = D. | last3 = Baur | first3 = B. | year = 2012 | title = Garden waste deposits as a source for non-native plants in mixed deciduous forests | doi = 10.1111/j.1654-109x.2011.01175.x | journal = Applied Vegetation Science | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 329–337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These specific chosen characteristics increase the chance of plant parts and seeds that are introduced into forested areas becoming a problem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The three major causes of animal habitat degradation are; the disruption or loss of ecosystem functions, the loss of food resources and loss of resident species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Airoldi | first1 = L. | last2 = Balata | first2 = D. | last3 = Beck | first3 = M.W. | year = 2008 | title = The Gray Zone: Relationships between habitat loss and marine diversity and their applications in conservation | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology | volume = 366 | issue = | pages = 8–15 | doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2008.07.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-native invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through competition, pest and disease transportation and habitat and ecosystem alteration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mack | first1 = R.N. | last2 = Simberloff | first2 = D. | last3 = Lonsdale | first3 = W.M. | last4 = Evans | first4 = H. | last5 = Clout | first5 = M. | last6 = Bazzaz | first6 = F.A. | year = 2000 | title = Biotic invasions: causes, epidemiology, global consequences, and control | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 689–710 | doi=10.2307/2641039| jstor = 2641039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The dumping of garden waste in nature reserves surrounding and near urban areas increases the risk of fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindenmayer | first1 = D. | last2 = Burgman | first2 = M. | last3 = Akçakaya | first3 = H. | last4 = Lacy | first4 = R. | last5 = Possingham | first5 = H. | year = 1995 | title = A review of the generic computer programs ALEX, RAMAS/space and VORTEX for modelling the viability of wildlife metapopulations | doi = 10.1016/0304-3800(94)00085-v | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 82 | issue = 2| pages = 161–174 | url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10194/hp_em_82_95.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dumped garden waste will eventually dry out creating fuel adding to already fallen debris fuel load on which a fire can thrive and spread on.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/threatenedspecies/08450krp.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Garden waste can spread weeds and these weeds build fuel for fires.
Dumped garden waste can facilitate higher rates of erosion by smothering natural vegetation cover.&lt;ref name="ehp.qld.gov.au"&gt;Department of Environment and Heritage Protection. (2016). Ehp.qld.gov.au. Retrieved 13 May 2016, from https://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt;
With no root systems for stabilisation the top soil is vulnerable to erosion (Ritter, J. 2015), This can add higher  levels of sediments, contributing to the siltation of creeks and waterways.&lt;ref name="maroondah.vic.gov.au"&gt;Home - Maroondah City Council. (2016). Maroondah.vic.gov.au. Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.maroondah.vic.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

If plant matter gets into waterways it can create reduced oxygen levels through the process of decomposition of green waste such as lawn clippings. This directly upsets the quality of water, affecting fish and aquatic wildlife.&lt;ref name="maroondah.vic.gov.au"/&gt;
This dumping of green waste can also lead to the blocking of drainage systems; directly through the build-up of plant debris, and indirectly through the spread of invasive plant species that colonise wet areas, reducing and or changing the flow of waterways. This change in flow, including path and velocity, can alter hydrological cycles, affecting frequency and intensity of floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gordon | first1 = D | year = 1998 | title = Effects of Invasive, Non-Indigenous Plant Species on Ecosystem Processes: Lessons from Florida | doi = 10.2307/2640955 | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 8 | issue = 4| page = 975 | jstor = 2640955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Green and garden waste has a direct impact to the visual aesthetics of land and can often attract further [[illegal dumping]].

===Increased fire risk===
Dumping garden waste in [[nature reserves]] and parks surrounding and near [[urban areas]] can effect directly and indirectly the existing [[flora]] and [[fauna]], as well as human life through the  increased risk of fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindenmayer | first1 = D. | last2 = Burgman | first2 = M. | last3 = Akçakaya | first3 = H. | last4 = Lacy | first4 = R. | last5 = Possingham | first5 = H. | year = 1995 | title = A review of the generic computer programs ALEX, RAMAS/space and VORTEX for modelling the viability of wildlife metapopulations | doi = 10.1016/0304-3800(94)00085-v | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 82 | issue = 2| pages = 161–174 | url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10194/hp_em_82_95.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dumped garden waste will eventually dry, creating additional  fuel, adding to already fallen debris on which a fire can thrive and spread. Garden waste can spread weeds and these weeds also build fuel for fires. Fires may also spread to the suburban areas where humans can also be impacted by losing their homes from fire, incur injury or death from smoke or burns, and suffer economic loses such as income loss and clean-up costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scorza | first1 = C. | last2 = Cavalheiro | first2 = E. | last3 = Scorza | first3 = F. | year = 2008 | title = Myocyte-specific enhancer binding factor 2C (MEF2C) expression in the dentate gyrus during development and after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus: a preliminary report | doi = 10.1590/s0004-282x2008000500024 | journal = Arq.

===Threat to biodiversity===
The invasion of exotic plant [[species]] into remnant native forests is a threat to biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allison | first1 = H. | last2 = Hobbs | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Natural Resource Management at Four Social Scales: Psychological Type Matters | doi = 10.1007/s00267-010-9442-1 | pmid = 20148248 | journal = Environmental Management | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 590–602 | url = http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/1435/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some impacts of habitat degradation include; when native animals, insects and birds become vulnerable and put at risk; loss of food source for native wildlife; disruption of native plant-animal relationships ie pollination and seed dispersal and disconnection of plant-host relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singh | first1 = A. | last2 = Singhal | first2 = G. | year = 1999 | title = Journal search results - Cite This For Me. | doi = 10.1023/a:1007095426376 | journal = Photosynthetica | volume = 36 | issue = 1/2| pages = 213–223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly adaptive plants chosen for their ease of cultivation out compete more specialised species.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 
Weed invasion of a forest system can change the processes of plant succession (the system of one species replacing another due to disturbance factors), the composition of the [[plant community]] and the composition and availability of nutrients. The change in forest composition can lead to loss of unique plant species.
When a habitat is destroyed, the plants, animals, and other [[organisms]] that occupied the habitat have a reduced carrying capacity so that populations decline and [[extinction]] becomes a threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1109/mahc.2004.35 | volume=26 | issue=4 | title=Table of Contents | journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing | pages=c2| year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem. The term 'hotspot' is used to describe areas featuring exceptional concentrations of endemic species and facing high potential of habitat degradation. The 25 most significant hotspots contain the habitats of 133,149 plant species (44% of all plant species worldwide; table 1) and 9,645 vertebrate species (35% of all vertebrate worldwide; table 2). These endemics are confined to an expanse of 2.1 million square kilometers (1.4% of land surface). Having lost 88% of their primary vegetation, they formerly occupied 17.4 million square kilometers or 11.8% of land surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Myers | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = The surface of α-subunit loop 1 distant from the subunit interface is exposed in the hCG lutropin receptor complex | doi = 10.1016/s0304-4165(00)00097-0 | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects | volume = 1475 | issue = 3| pages = 390–394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The recruitment of alien invasive species may lead to a homogenisation of landscapes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Although increased bio diversity in subregions created by newly [[introduced species]] may occur, the displacement of the existing plant species may lead to reduced biodiversity on a global scale.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

When population-level properties that indicate superior competitive ability of the invading species are examined, 13–24 (42–77%) of the species are included, with the majority of species showing traits capable of modifying natural systems at both ecosystem and community/population scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Doria R.|date=1998-01-01|title=Effects of Invasive, Non-Indigenous Plant Species on Ecosystem Processes: Lessons from Florida|jstor=2640955|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=8|issue=4|pages=975–989|doi=10.2307/2640955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waterways quality===
The dumping of green waste such as lawn clippings can block drainage systems which pollutes water therefore effecting water quality and the health of aquatic plants and animals. Dumped garden waste can add high levels of sediments, reducing the light available for photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Water quality"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maroondah.vic.gov.au/WaterQuality.aspx|title=Water quality|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maroondah.vic.gov.au"/&gt;  Dumping also block waterways and roads, cause flooding and facilitate higher rates of erosion by smothering natural vegetation cover.&lt;ref name="ehp.qld.gov.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Water quality"/&gt;

==Causes / stakeholders==
Illegal dumping is carried out by all types of people in all parts of the community, from householders to businesses and other organizations. Addressing these motivations will enable strategies to be developed that deal with the root causes, rather than the results, of illegal dumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=164054495563058;res=IELAPA |title=Tougher penalties for illegal waste in NSW [online]|journal=Waste Management and Environment |volume=25|issue=2|pages=14|date=March 2014|last1=Parrino|first1=Maysaa|last2=Kaoutarani|first2=Salam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the main reasons for this careless disregard for waste can be put down to sheer convenience, lack of care for the environment and also a reluctance to pay for the correct collection or disposal of the waste. The monitoring of illegally dumped garden waste by the community and industries will drive effectual tactics to battle illegal depositing. People dump waste illegally to avoid disposal fees at landfill sites or because they do not want to spend the time or effort disposing of or recycling their waste properly.&lt;ref name="Water quality"/&gt; Alligator weed (''Alternanthera philoxeroides'' (Mart.) Griseb.) is an introduced weed originating from Sri Lanka and is creating major issues throughout the Australia since its introduction into the country. Alligator weed has the potential to affect aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity severely and to cause considerable social and economic costs, particularly in aquatic situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panetta|first=F. Dane|last2=Lawes|first2=Roger|date=2005-09-01|title=Evaluation of weed eradication programs: the delimitation of extent|journal=Diversity and Distributions|language=en|volume=11|issue=5|pages=435–442|doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2005.00179.x|issn=1472-4642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation==
Education on the value of biodiversity and the negative effects of weed invasion have been identified as key items in changing current trends. Specific education campaigns on the risks of dumping garden waste could be targeted at high-risk societal groups such as residents of housing in close proximity to reserves as well as members of gardening communities and plant sellers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 
Restricting the selection of garden species in new housing developments adjacent to reserves may reduce the effects of [[illegal dumping]], thereby reducing requirement and associated cost of weed management. Creating habitat for wildlife by planting native plants, making a water source available, provide shelter and places to raise young.&lt;ref&gt;National Wildlife Federation. (2016). Nwf.org. Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.nwf.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Healthy ecosystems are necessary for the survival and health of all organisms, and there are a number of ways to reduce negative impact on the environment. Cultivation of native plant species may benefit not only native plant populations but also native animal populations. For example, Sears &amp; Anderson suggest&lt;ref name="Urbanization, Biodiversity 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKinney | first1 = M | year = 2002 | title = Urbanization, Biodiversity, and Conservation | doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052[0883:ubac]2.0.co;2 | journal = BioScience | volume = 52 | issue = 10| page = 883 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that native bird species diversity in Australia and North America tend to match the volume and diversity of native vegetation. Crisp also explains&lt;ref name="Urbanization, Biodiversity 2002"/&gt; the percentage of native insect species in a fauna has been found to be consistent with the percentage of native plant species.

Composting is a great way to recycle nutrients back into soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 0 | last1 = et al | year = 2014 | title = Dr. Reynolds, ''et al.'' reply | doi = 10.3899/jrheum.080694 | pmid = 19208581 | journal = The Journal of Rheumatology | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 454–5; author reply 455 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulching the garden with leaves and clippings (BMCC, n.d). 
Fostering an appreciation of local natural environmental features and plant species may also help mitigate the issue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; as well as the restriction of highly invasive plant species through international policy.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN. 2000. Guidelines for the Prevention of Biodiversity Loss Caused by Alien Invasive Species. http://intranet.iucn.org/webfiles/doc/SSC/SSCwebsite/Policy&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Utilization of green waste bins that are provided by some councils or shires that are emptied via curbside collection (BMCC. n.d). The addition of facilities for waste disposal could also improve the issue (DECC. 2008).
Mitigation may involve governments holding campaigns that show people disposing legally and reporting the consequences for disposing illegally.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/resources/waste/150111env-guide-solid-waste-landfills.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A way Australian governments are addressing the problem is through the increase of fines in conjunction with better law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/resources/waste/150111env-guide-solid-waste-landfills.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Australia, fines can be up to $1,000,000 and can also incur imprisonment. The Protection of the Environment Operations Act imposes penalties for offences including polluting waters with waste, polluting land, illegally dumping waste or using land as an illegal waste facility.&lt;ref&gt;Increased penalties for illegal waste dumping in NSW - Colin Biggers &amp; Paisley. (2016). Cbp.com.au. Retrieved 21 May 2016, from http://www.cbp.com.au/publications/2013/november/increased-penalties-for-illegal-waste-dumping-in-n&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The new section of the ''POEO Act'' (The Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997) now imposes further penalties for offences including polluting waters with waste, polluting land, illegally dumping waste or using land as an illegal waste facility &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/waste/illegal_dumping.html|title=Illegal dumping|last=Protection|first=jurisdiction=Queensland; sector=government; corporateName=Department of Environment and Heritage|website=www.ehp.qld.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Parrino, Maysaa, Kaoutarani &amp; Salam, 2014). Communities are encouraged to report illegal dumping. In accordance with NSW Illegal Dumping Strategy 2014-16, hefty fines and a maximum jail sentence of 2 years can be handed down to repeat offenders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8486">'''Germ theory denialism''' is the belief that [[Microorganism|germs]] do not cause infectious disease, and that the [[germ theory of disease]] is wrong.{{R|"novella"}} It usually involves arguing that [[Louis Pasteur]]'s model of infectious disease was wrong, and that [[Antoine Béchamp]]'s was right. In fact, its origins are rooted in Béchamp's empirically disproved (in the context of disease) theory of [[pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphism]]. {{R|"gorski"}} Another obsolete variation is known as [[terrain theory]] and postulates that diseased tissue attracts germs rather than being caused by it.{{R|"brock"}}

== About ==

Germ theory denialism (GTD) is as old as germ theory itself beginning with the rivalry of Pasteur and Béchamp. Pasteur's work in preventing beverage contamination led him to discover that it was due to [[microorganisms]] and led him down the path to be the first scientist to show the theory was valid and popularize it in Europe.{{R|"gorski"}} Although he was not the first to have the idea and scientists such as [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] (had the idea that [[fomites]] could harbor the seeds of contagion), [[Agostino Bassi]] (discovered the [[muscardine]] disease of silkworms was caused by a fungus that was named [[Beauveria bassiana]]), [[Friedrich Henle]] (developed the concepts of contagium vivum and contagium animatum), and others had earlier proposed ideas similar to germ theory.{{R|"contagion"}}{{R|"guthrie"}}

Béchamp strongly contested this view offering up a competing idea known as the pleomorphic theory of disease. This theory says that all life is based on forms that a certain class of organisms take during stages of their life-cycles and that germs are attracted to the environment of diseased tissue rather than being the cause of it.{{R|"bechamp"}} Proponents of this idea insist microbes that live in an organism go through the same stages of their development. According to [[Günther Enderlein]] they are as follows: [[Colloid]] — [[microbe]] (primitive phase), [[bacteria]] (middle phase), and [[fungus]] (end phase).{{R|"synth"}}

Earlier non-germ theories, in addition to the earlier idea of [[Miasma theory|miasma]], focused on [[spontaneous generation]] - the idea that living matter could arise from non-living - and the terrain theory variation of Béchamp's ideas. Pasteur disproved spontaneous generation with a series of experiments in the 1870s.{{R|"contagion"}} However, understanding the cause of a sickness does not always immediately lead to effective treatment of sickness and the great decline in mortality during the 19th century is mostly associated with improvement in hygiene and cleanliness. In fact, one of the first movements to deny the germ theory was the Sanitary Movement, and was nevertheless central in developing America's [[public health]] infrastructure. By providing clean water and sanitation there was less of an environment for [[pathogens]] to develop and [[mortality rates]] fell dramatically.{{R|"pizzi"}}

GTD has significant overlap with [[chiropractic]] practice. Many [[chiropractor]]s believe [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to be a function of spine alignment and the brain's ability to communicate efficiently with the body and that it has little to nothing to do with external [[pathogen]]s.{{R|"barrett"}}

A common thread among many alternative medicine proponents is [[Anti-vaccine movement|opposition to vaccines]] and many use GTD to justify their claims.{{R|"crislip"}} Germ theory deniers make many claims about the biological underpinnings of the theory and the historical record{{R|"fielder"}}{{R|"arizona"}} that are at odds with what is accepted by most modern scientists and historians.{{R|"novella"}}{{R|"gorski"}}{{R|"contagion"}}{{R|"hodkinson"}} Another popular claim from the anti-vaccine community is that all diseases are caused by [[Bacteremia|toxemia]] due to inadequate diet and health practices.{{R|"hall"}}

== Criticism ==

[[Harriet Hall]] published an article in ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' where she describes her experience arguing with germ theory deniers.{{R|"hall"}}

Members of the medical community that are also skeptics, such as [[David Gorski]] and [[Steven Novella]], point out that denying germ theory is counter to years of experiments and the prevailing opinion of most doctors and scientists.{{R|"novella"}}{{R|"gorski"}}{{R|"orac"}}

'''''Gestell''''' (or sometimes '''''Ge-stell''''') is a [[German language|German]] word used by twentieth-century German [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Martin Heidegger]] to describe what lies behind or beneath modern [[technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

It was derived from the root word ''stellen'', which means "to put" or "to place" and combined with the German prefix ''Ge-'', which denotes a form of "gathering" or "collection".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger on Technology|last=Wendland|first=Aaron|last2=Merwin|first2=Christopher|last3=Hadjioannou|first3=Christos|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781138674615|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gathers together all kinds of entities and orders them in a certain way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Heidegger's notion of ''Gestell''==
Heidegger applied the concept of ''Gestell'' to his exposition of the [[essence]] of [[technology]]. He concluded that technology is fundamentally '''Enframing''' (''Gestell'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

As such, the essence of technology is ''Gestell''. Indeed, "''Gestell'', literally 'framing', is an all-encompassing view of technology, not as a means to an end, but rather a mode of [[human]] [[existence]]".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/martin1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110153844/http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/martin1.html |archivedate=2006-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such enframing pertains to the manner reality appears or unveils itself in the period of modern technology and people born into this "mode of ordering" are always embedded into the Gestell (enframing).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gendered Bodies and New Technologies: Rethinking Embodiment in a Cyber-era|last=du Preez|first=Amanda|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9781443813235|location=Newcastle upon Tyne, UK|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In defining the essence of technology as ''Gestell'', Heidegger indicated that all that has come to presence in the world has been enframed. Thus what is revealed in the world, what has shown itself as itself (the truth of itself) required first an Enframing, literally a way to exist in the world, to be able to be seen and understood. Concerning the essence of technology and how we see things in our technological age, the world has been framed as the "standing-reserve." Heidegger writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Enframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon which sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve. Enframing means that way of revealing which holds sway in the essence of modern technology and which is itself nothing technological.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays'' (New York: Harper, 1977), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, Heidegger uses the word in a way that is uncommon by giving ''Gestell'' an active role. In ordinary usage the word would signify simply a display apparatus of some sort, like a book rack, or picture frame; but for Heidegger, ''Gestell'' is literally a challenging forth, or ''perform''ative "gathering together", for the purpose of revealing or presentation. If applied to science and modern technology, "standing reserve" is active in the case of a river once it generates electricity or the earth if revealed as a coal-mining district or the soil as a mineral deposit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger and the Work of Art History|last=Boetzkes|first=Amanda|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409456131|location=Oxon|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For some scholars, Gestell effectively explains the violence of technology. This is attributed to Heidegger's explanation that, when Gestell holds sway, "it drives out every other possibility of revealing" and that it "conceals that revealing which, in the sense of ''[[poiesis]]'', lets what presences come forth into appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger's Later Philosophy|last=Young|first=Julian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521809223|location=Cambridge|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3913">In [[mathematics]], '''Grothendieck's Galois theory''' is an abstract approach to the [[Galois theory]] of fields, developed around 1960 to provide a way to study the [[fundamental group]] of [[algebraic topology]] in the setting of [[algebraic geometry]]. It provides, in the classical setting of [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], an alternative perspective to that of [[Emil Artin]] based on [[linear algebra]], which became standard from about the 1930s.

The approach of [[Alexander Grothendieck]] is concerned with the [[category theory|category-theoretic]] properties that characterise the categories of finite ''G''-sets for a fixed [[profinite group]] ''G''.  For example, ''G'' might be the group denoted &lt;math&gt;\hat{\Z}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[inverse limit]] of the cyclic additive groups '''Z'''/n'''Z''' &amp;mdash; or equivalently the completion of the [[infinite cyclic group]] '''Z''' for the topology of subgroups of finite [[Index of a subgroup|index]]. A finite ''G''-set is then a finite set ''X'' on which ''G'' acts through a quotient finite cyclic group, so that it is specified by giving some permutation of ''X''.

In the above example, a connection with classical [[Galois theory]] can be seen by regarding &lt;math&gt;\hat{\Z}&lt;/math&gt; as the profinite Galois group Gal(&lt;span style="text-decoration:overline"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;/F) of the [[algebraic closure]] &lt;span style="text-decoration:overline"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt; of any [[finite field]] ''F'', over ''F''. That is, the automorphisms of &lt;span style="text-decoration:overline"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt; fixing ''F'' are described by the inverse limit, as we take larger and larger finite [[splitting field]]s over ''F''.  The connection with geometry can be seen when we look at [[covering space]]s of the [[unit disk]] in the [[complex plane]] with the origin removed: the finite covering realised by the ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; map of the disk, thought of by means of a complex number variable ''z'', corresponds to the subgroup ''n''.'''Z''' of the fundamental group of the punctured disk.

The theory of Grothendieck, published in [[SGA1]], shows how to reconstruct the category of ''G''-sets from a ''fibre functor'' &amp;Phi;, which in the geometric setting takes the fibre of a covering above a fixed base point (as a set). In fact there is an isomorphism proved of the type

:''G'' &amp;cong; Aut(&amp;Phi;),

the latter being the group of automorphisms (self-[[natural equivalence]]s) of &amp;Phi;. An abstract classification of categories with a functor to the category of sets is given, by means of which one can recognise categories of ''G''-sets for ''G'' profinite.

To see how this applies to the case of fields, one has to study the [[tensor product of fields]].{{clarify|more details are needed.|date=November 2017}} Later developments in [[topos]] theory make this all part of a theory of ''[[atomic topos]]es''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8778">The '''hypothetico-deductive model''' or  '''method''' is a proposed description of [[scientific method]]. According to it, [[scientific inquiry]] proceeds by formulating a [[hypothesis]] in a form that can be [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]], using a test on observable data where the outcome is not yet known. A test outcome that could have and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis.  A test outcome that could have, but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory.  It is then proposed to compare the explanatory value of competing hypotheses by testing how stringently they are corroborated by their predictions.

==Example==
{{main|Scientific method}}
One example of an algorithmic statement of the hypothetico-deductive method is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003) ''Theory and Reality'', p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="padding-left:1.25em;text-indent:-1.25em"&gt;
:'''''1'''''. Use your experience: Consider the problem and try to make sense of it. Gather data and look for previous explanations. If this is a new problem to you, then move to step&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''.
:'''''2'''''. Form a conjecture ([[hypothesis]]): When nothing else is yet known, try to state an explanation, to someone else, or to your notebook.
:'''''3'''''. Deduce predictions from the hypothesis: if you assume&amp;nbsp;'''''2''''' is true, what consequences follow?
:'''''4'''''. Test (or [[experiment]]): Look for evidence (observations) that conflict with these predictions in order to disprove&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''. It is a logical error to seek&amp;nbsp;'''''3''''' directly as proof of&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''. This [[formal fallacy]] is called ''[[affirming the consequent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taleb|2007}} e.g., p. 58, devotes his chapter 5 to ''the error of confirmation''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

One possible sequence in this model would be '''''1''''', '''''2''''', '''''3''''', '''''4'''''. If the outcome of '''''4''''' holds, and '''''3''''' is not yet disproven, you may continue with '''''3''''', '''''4''''', '''''1''''', and so forth; but if the outcome of '''''4''''' shows '''''3''''' to be false, you will have to go back to '''''2''''' and try to invent a '''''new 2''''', deduce a '''''new 3''''', look for '''''4''''', and so forth.

Note that this method can never absolutely '''verify''' (prove the truth of) '''''2'''''. It can only '''[[Falsifiability|falsify]]''' '''''2'''''.&lt;ref&gt;"I believe that we do not know anything for certain, but everything probably." —[[Christiaan Huygens]], Letter to Pierre Perrault, 'Sur la préface de M. Perrault de son traité del'Origine des fontaines' [1763], ''Oeuvres Complétes de Christiaan Huygens'' (1897), Vol. '''7''', 298. Quoted in Jacques Roger, ''The Life Sciences in Eighteenth-Century French Thought'', ed. Keith R. Benson and trans. Robert Ellrich (1997), 163. Quotation selected by {{harvnb|Bynum|Porter|2005|p=317}} Huygens 317#4.&lt;/ref&gt; (This is what Einstein meant when he said, "No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong."&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Alice Calaprice (ed. 2005) ''The New Quotable Einstein'' Princeton University Press and Hebrew University of Jerusalem, {{ISBN|0-691-12074-9}} p. 291. Calaprice denotes this not as an exact quotation, but as a paraphrase of a translation of A. Einstein's "Induction and Deduction". ''Collected Papers of Albert Einstein'' '''7''' Document 28. Volume 7 is ''The Berlin Years: Writings, 1918-1921''. A. Einstein; M. Janssen, R. Schulmann, et al., eds.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Discussion==
Additionally, as pointed out by [[Carl Hempel]] (1905–1997), this simple view of the scientific method is incomplete; a conjecture can also incorporate probabilities, e.g., the drug is effective about 70% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Murzi, Mauro (2001, 2008), "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/hempel.htm Carl Gustav Hempel (1905—1997)]", ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Murzi used the term relative frequency rather than probability.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tests, in this case, must be repeated to substantiate the conjecture (in particular, the probabilities). In this and other cases, we can quantify a probability for our confidence in the conjecture itself and then apply a [[Bayesian analysis]], with each experimental result shifting the probability either up or down. [[Bayes' theorem]] shows that the probability will never reach exactly 0 or 100% (no absolute certainty in either direction), but it can still get very close to either extreme. See also [[confirmation holism]].

Qualification of corroborating evidence is sometimes raised as philosophically problematic. The [[raven paradox]] is a famous example. The hypothesis that 'all ravens are black' would appear to be corroborated by observations of only black ravens. However, 'all ravens are black' is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to 'all non-black things are non-ravens' (this is the [[contraposition]] form of the original implication). 'This is a green tree' is an observation of a non-black thing that is a non-raven and therefore corroborates 'all non-black things are non-ravens'. It appears to follow that the observation 'this is a green tree' is corroborating evidence for the hypothesis 'all ravens are black'.  Attempted resolutions may distinguish:
* non-falsifying observations as to strong, moderate, or weak corroborations
* investigations that do or do not provide a potentially falsifying test of the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[John N.W. Watkins]] (1984), ''Science and Skepticism'', p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence contrary to a hypothesis is itself philosophically problematic. Such evidence is called a [[falsifiability|falsification]] of the hypothesis. However, under the theory of [[confirmation holism]] it is always possible to save a given hypothesis from falsification. This is so because any falsifying observation is embedded in a theoretical background, which can be modified in order to save the hypothesis.  Popper acknowledged this but maintained that a critical approach respecting methodological rules that avoided such ''immunizing stratagems'' is conducive to the progress of science.&lt;ref&gt;Karl R. Popper (1979, Rev. ed.), ''Objective Knowledge'', pp. 30, 360.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]] claims the model ignores [[underdetermination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/07/03/what-is-science/ |author=Sean Carroll |title=What is Science?}}&lt;/ref&gt;


'''The hypothetico-deductive model (or approach) versus other research models'''

The hypothetico-deductive approach contrasts with other research models such as the inductive approach or grounded theory. In the data percolation methodology, 
the hypothetico-deductive approach is included in a paradigm of pragmatism by which four types of relations between the variables can exist: descriptive, of influence, longitudinal or causal. The variables are classified in two groups, structural and functional, a classification that drives the formulation of hypotheses and the statistical tests to be performed on the data so as to increase the efficiency of the research. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Mesly |first= Olivier | date= 2015 |title= Creating Models in Psychological Research | location= United States | publisher= Springer Psychology  |pages= 126  |ISBN = 978-3-319-15752-8}}

'''Instinct''' or '''innate behavior''' is the inherent inclination of a [[life|living]] [[organism]] towards a particular complex [[behavior]]. The simplest example of an instinctive behavior is a [[fixed action pattern]] (FAP), in which a very short to medium length sequence of actions, without variation, are carried out in response to a clearly defined stimulus. 
[[File:Instinct dog shake.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An instinctive behavior of shaking water from wet fur.]]

[[File:BabyLoggerheadTlalcoyunque3.jpg|thumb|220px|A baby [[leatherback turtle]] makes its way to the open ocean]]
Any behavior is instinctive if it is performed without being based upon prior experience (that is, in the absence of [[learning]]), and is therefore an expression of innate biological factors.  [[Sea turtle]]s, newly hatched on a beach, will automatically move toward the ocean.  A [[marsupial]] climbs into its mother's pouch upon being born. [[Honeybee]]s communicate by dancing in the direction of a food source without formal instruction. Other examples include animal fighting, animal [[courtship]] behavior, internal escape functions, and the building of [[nest]]s.

Instincts are inborn complex patterns of behavior that exist in most members of the species, and should be distinguished from [[reflex]]es, which are simple responses of an organism to a specific stimulus, such as the contraction of the pupil in response to bright light or the spasmodic movement of the lower leg when the knee is tapped. The absence of volitional capacity must not be confused with an inability to modify fixed action patterns. For example, people may be able to modify a stimulated fixed action pattern by consciously recognizing the point of its activation and simply stop doing it, whereas animals without a sufficiently strong volitional capacity may not be able to disengage from their fixed action patterns, once activated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lorenz |first=Konrad |title=Behind the Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge |year=1977 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=New York |isbn=0-15-111699-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Greifreflex.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Primitive reflex]]es]]

===In biology===
[[Jean Henri Fabre]] (1823-1915), an [[entomologist]], considered instinct to be any behavior which did not require [[cognition]] or [[consciousness]] to perform. Fabre's inspiration was his intense study of insects, some of whose behaviors he wrongly considered fixed and not subject to environmental influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Insectopedia |first=Hugh |last=Raffles |publisher=Pantheon Books |location=New York |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-375-42386-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instinct as a concept fell out of favor in the 1920s with the rise of [[behaviorism]] and such thinkers as [[B. F. Skinner]], which held that most significant behavior is learned.

An interest in innate behaviors arose again in the 1950s with [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], who made the distinction between instinct and learned behaviors.  Our modern understanding of instinctual behavior in animals owes much to their work.  For instance, there exists a sensitive period for a bird in which it learns the identity of its mother. Konrad Lorenz famously had a goose imprint on his boots. Thereafter the goose would follow whoever wore the boots. The identity of the goose's mother was learned, but the goose's behavior towards the boots was instinctive.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===In psychology===
The term "instinct" in [[psychology]] was first used in the 1870s by [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. By the close of the 19th century, most repeated behavior was considered instinctual.  In a survey of the literature at that time, one researcher chronicled 4,000 human "instincts," having applied this label to any behavior that was repetitive.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} As research became more rigorous and terms better defined, instinct as an explanation for human behavior became less common.  In a conference in 1960, chaired by [[Frank Beach]], a pioneer in [[comparative psychology]], and attended by luminaries in the field, the term was restricted in its application.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} During the 1960s and 1970s, textbooks still contained some discussion of instincts in reference to human behavior.  By the year 2000, a survey of the 12 best selling textbooks in Introductory Psychology revealed only one reference to instincts, and that was in regard to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s referral to the "[[Id, ego, and super-ego#Id|id]]" instincts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. In this sense, instincts appeared to have become regarded as increasingly superfluous in trying to understand human psychological behavior.

Psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] argued that humans no longer have instincts because we have the ability to override them in certain situations. He felt that what is called instinct is often imprecisely defined, and really amounts to strong ''drives''. For Maslow, an instinct is something which cannot be overridden, and therefore while the term may have applied to humans in the past, it no longer does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Abraham H. |last=Maslow |title=Motivation and Personality |chapter=Instinct Theory Reexamined |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1954 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Instinct'' (1961) established a number of criteria which distinguish instinctual from other kinds of behavior.  To be considered instinctual, a behavior must follow these criteria:  a) be automatic, b) be irresistible, c) occur at some point in development, d) be triggered by some event in the environment, e) occur in every member of the species, f) be unmodifiable, and g) govern behavior for which the organism needs no training (although the organism may profit from experience and to that degree the behavior is modifiable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandal |first=F. B. |year=2010 |title=Textbook of Animal Behaviour |publisher=PHI Learning |page=47 |isbn=978-81-203-4035-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a classic paper published in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nature as Nurture: Behaviorism and the Instinct Doctrine |first=R. J. |last=Harrnstein |journal=Behaviorism |year=1972 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=23–52 |jstor=27758791 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the psychologist [[Richard Herrnstein]] decries Fabre's opinions on instinct (see: In biology section).

===In behavioral sciences===

In ''Information behavior: An Evolutionary Instinct'' (2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;35–42), Amanda Spink notes that "currently in the behavioral sciences instinct is generally understood as the innate part of behavior that emerges without any training or education in humans." She claims that the viewpoint that information behavior has an instinctive basis is grounded in the latest thinking on human behavior. Furthermore, she notes that "behaviors such as cooperation, sexual behavior, child rearing and aesthetics are [also] seen as 'evolved psychological mechanisms' with an instinctive basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buss |first=D.   |title=Evolutionary psychology: The new science of the mind |location=Boston |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon |edition=3rd |year=2008   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickens |first=W.

C. |title=The origin of mind: Evolution of brain, cognition, and general intelligence. |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Psychological Association   |year=2004   }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spink adds that [[Steven Pinker]] similarly asserts that language acquisition is instinctive in humans in his book ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' (1994).

==Reflexes==
{{main|Reflex}}
Examples of behaviors that do not require conscious will include many reflexes. The stimulus in a reflex may not require brain activity but instead may travel to the spinal cord as a message that is then transmitted back through the body, tracing a path called the [[reflex arc]]. Reflexes are similar to [[fixed action pattern]]s in that most reflexes meet the criteria of a FAP.  However, a fixed action pattern can be processed in the brain as well; a male [[stickleback]]'s instinctive aggression towards anything red during his mating season is such an example.  Examples of instinctive behaviors in humans include many of the [[primitive reflexes]], such as rooting and suckling, behaviors which are present in [[mammal]]s. In rats, it has been observed that innate responses are related to specific chemicals, and these chemicals are detected by two organs located in the nose: the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and the main olfactory epithelium (MOE).&lt;ref&gt;Sokolowski, Katie (2012). "Wired for behaviors: from development to function of innate limbic system circuitry". Frontiers in molecular neuroscience (1662-5099), 5, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maturational==

Some instinctive behaviors depend on maturational processes to appear. For instance, we commonly refer to birds "learning" to fly. However, young birds have been experimentally reared in devices that prevent them from moving their wings until they reached the age at which their cohorts were flying. These birds flew immediately and normally when released, showing that their improvement resulted from neuromuscular maturation and not true learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |last2=Reece |first2=Jane B. |title=Biology |location=San Francisco |publisher=Addison Wesley |edition=6th |year=2002 |isbn=0-201-75054-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In evolution==

Imprinting provides one example of instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blumberg|first=Mark S.|date=2017|title=Development evolving:The origins and meanings of instinct|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|volume=8|issue=1-2|pages=|doi=10.1002/wcs.1371|issn=1939-5078|pmc=5182125|pmid=27906515|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This  complex response may involve visual, auditory, and olfactory cues in the environment surrounding an organism.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In some cases, imprinting attaches an offspring to its parent, which is a reproductive benefit to offspring survival.&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, Julian. 1957. Imprinting: The interaction of learned and innate behavior: II. The critical period. Journal of comparative &amp; physiological psychology  0021-50 (1), p. 6. Kim, Young-Joon. 2006. A Command Chemical Triggers an Innate Behavior by Sequential Activation of Multiple Peptidergic Ensembles. Current biology 096016 (14), p. 1395.&lt;/ref&gt; If an offspring has attachment to a parent, it is more likely to stay nearby under parental protection. Attached offspring are also more likely to learn from a parental figure when interacting  closely. (Reproductive benefits are a driving force behind [[natural selection]].)

Environment is an important factor in how innate behavior has evolved.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} A hypothesis of Michael McCollough, a positive psychologist, explains that environment plays a key role in human behaviors such as forgiveness and revenge. This hypothesis theorizes that various social environments cause either forgiveness or revenge to prevail. McCollough relates his theory to [[game theory]].&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, Michael. 2010. Beyond revenge: the evolution of the forgiveness instinct. ''The Journal of Positive Psychology'', p. 97-100.&lt;/ref&gt; In a tit-for-tat strategy, cooperation and retaliation are comparable to forgiveness and revenge. The choice between the two can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on what the partner-organism chooses. Though this psychological example of game theory does not have such directly measurable results, it provides an interesting theory of unique thought. From a more biological standpoint, the brain's [[limbic system]] operates as the main control-area for response to certain stimuli, including a variety of instinctual behavior. The limbic system processes external stimuli related to emotions, social activity, and motivation, which propagates a behavioral response. Some behaviors include maternal care, aggression, defense, and social hierarchy.  These behaviors are influenced by sensory input — sight, sound, touch, and smell.

Within the circuitry of the limbic system, there are various places where evolution could have taken place, or could take place in the future. For example, many rodents have receptors in the [[vomeronasal organ]] that respond explicitly to predator stimuli that specifically relate to that individual species of rodent. The reception of a predatory stimulus usually creates a response of defense or fear.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolowski, Katie 2012. Wired for behaviors: from development to function of innate limbic system circuitry. ''Frontiers in molecular neuroscience'' 1662, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=May 2017}} Mating in rats follows a similar mechanism. The vomeronasal organ and the main olfactory epithelium, together called the [[olfactory system]], detect pheromones from the opposite sex. These signals then travel  to the medial amygdala, which disperses the signal to a variety of brain parts. The pathways involved with innate circuitry are extremely specialized and specific.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolowski, Katie 2012. Wired for behaviors: from development to function of innate limbic system circuitry. ''Frontiers in molecular neuroscience'' 1662, p. 	55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Various organs and sensory receptors play parts in this complex process.

Instinct is a phenomenon that can be investigated from a multitude of angles: genetics, limbic system, nervous pathways, and environment. Researchers can study levels of instincts, from molecular to groups of individuals. Extremely specialized systems have evolved, resulting in individuals which exhibit behaviors without learning them. Innate behavior is an important and interesting aspect of the biological world that people come into contact with every day.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49801">'''Lean startup''' is a [[methodology]] for developing businesses and products, which aims to shorten product [[development cycle]]s and rapidly discover if a proposed [[business model]] is viable; this is achieved by adopting a combination of business-[[hypothesis]]-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and [[validated learning]].

Central to the lean startup methodology is the assumption that when [[startup companies]] invest their time into iteratively building products or services to meet the needs of early customers, the company can reduce market risks and sidestep the need for large amounts of initial project funding and expensive product launches and failures.&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Penenberg |first=Adam L. |date=8 September 2011 |title=Eric Ries is a Lean Startup machine |journal=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1778706/eric-ries-lean-startup-machine |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wiredideas"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adler |first=Carlye |date=30 August 2011 |title=Ideas are overrated: startup guru Eric Ries' radical new theory |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/08/st_qareis/ |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
Similar to the precepts of [[lean manufacturing]] and [[lean software development]], the lean startup methodology seeks to eliminate wasteful practices and increase value-producing practices during the earliest phases of a company so that the company can have a better chance of success without requiring large amounts of outside funding, elaborate business plans, or a perfect product.&lt;ref name="inc"/&gt; Customer feedback during the development of products or services is integral to the lean startup process, and ensures that the company does not invest time designing features or services that consumers do not want.&lt;ref name="wallstreetjournal"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tam |first=Pui-Wing |date=20 May 2010 |title=Philosophy helps start-ups move faster |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704635204575242543105830072 |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done primarily through two processes, using key [[performance indicator]]s and a continuous deployment process.&lt;ref name="wiredideas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="techcrunchproduct"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ries |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Ries |date=11 September 2011 |title=Are you building the right product? |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/11/are-you-building-the-right-product/ |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techcrunch"&gt;{{cite web |last=Schonfeld |first=Erick |date=30 July 2011 |title=Don't be fooled by vanity metrics |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/30/vanity-metrics/ |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a startup company cannot afford to have its entire investment depend upon the success of a single product or service, the lean startup methodology proposes that by releasing a [[minimum viable product]] that is not yet finalized, the company can then make use of customer feedback to help further tailor the product or service to the specific needs of its customers.&lt;ref name="wiredideas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inc"/&gt;

The lean startup methodology asserts that the "lean has nothing to do with how much money a company raises"; rather it has everything to do with assessing the specific demands of consumers and how to meet that demand using the least amount of resources possible.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;

==Precursors==

===Lean manufacturing===
Use of the word ''lean'' to describe the streamlined production system of [[lean manufacturing]] was popularized by the 1990 book ''The Machine That Changed the World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Womack |first1=James P. |last2=Jones |first2=Daniel T. |last3=Roos |first3=Daniel |date=1990 |title=The machine that changed the world: based on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 5-million dollar 5-year study on the future of the automobile |location=New York |publisher=Rawson Associates |isbn=0892563508 |oclc=21977626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TWI"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dinero |first=Donald A. |date=2005 |title=Training within industry: the foundation of lean |location=New York |publisher=Productivity Press |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8BbW6sNiSwC&amp;pg=PA49 49–53] |isbn=1563273071 |oclc=58042977}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Toyota Production System]] pioneered by [[Taiichi Ohno]] combined flow principles that had been used by [[Henry Ford]] since the early 1900s with innovations such as the [[Training Within Industry|TWI]] programs introduced to Japan in 1951.&lt;ref name="TWI"/&gt;

Lean manufacturing systems consider as waste the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer, and continually seek ways to eliminate such waste. In particular, such systems focus on:
* minimizing inventory throughout the assembly line,
* using [[Kanban#Kanban cards|Kanban cards]] to signal only when the necessary inputs to production are needed, and in so doing, reduce assembly waste (inventory) and increase productivity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Womack |first1=James P. |last2=Jones |first2=Daniel T. |date=2003 |origyear=1996 |title=Lean thinking: banish waste and create wealth in your corporation |edition=Revised |location=New York |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |isbn=0743249275 |oclc=51031471 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* identifying mistakes or imperfections during assembly as early as possible at immediate quality control checkpoints to ensure that the least amount of time is expended developing a faulty product,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feld |first=William M. |date=2001 |title=Lean manufacturing: tools, techniques, and how to use them |location=Boca Raton, FL; Alexandria, VA |publisher=St. Lucie Press; [[APICS]] |isbn=157444297X |oclc=44732233 |page=[//books.google.com/books?id=zM_qqlrHKJ8C&amp;pg=PA84 84]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* maintaining close connections with suppliers in order to understand their customers' desires.

Lean manufacturing was later applied to software as [[lean software development]].

===Customer development===
The lean startup methodology is based on the customer development methodology of Silicon Valley serial entrepreneur-turned-academic [[Steve Blank]]. In his book ''The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win'' (2005, 5th edition 2013), Blank pointed out the pitfalls of a narrow emphasis on product development; instead he argued that startups should focus on what he called "customer development", which emphasizes "learning about customers and their problems as early in the development process as possible".&lt;ref name="foursteps"&gt;{{cite book |last=Blank |first=Steven G. |date=2007 |title=The four steps to the epiphany: successful strategies for products that win |edition=3rd |location=Pescadero, CA |publisher=S. G. Blank |isbn=0976470705 |oclc=778813594 |url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/e145/cgi-bin/winter/drupal/upload/handouts/Four_Steps.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} Blank's customer development methodology proposed four steps:&lt;ref name="foursteps"/&gt;{{rp|16–19}}

# ''Customer discovery'' tests hypotheses about the nature of the problem, interest in the product or service solution, and business viability.
# ''Customer validation'' tests the business viability through customer purchases and in the process creates a "sales road map", a proven and repeatable sales process. Customer discovery and customer validation corroborate the business model.
# ''Customer creation'' executes the business plan by scaling through customer acquisition, creating user demand and directing it toward the company's sales channels.
# ''Company building'' formalizes and standardizes company departments and operations.

In an article published in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' in 2013, Steve Blank described how the lean startup methodology also drew inspiration from the work of people like Ian C. MacMillan and [[Rita Gunther McGrath]] who developed a technique called [[discovery-driven planning]], which was an attempt to bring an entrepreneurial mindset to planning.&lt;ref name="hbr2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blank |first=Steven G. |authorlink=Steve Blank |date=May 2013 |title=Why the lean start-up changes everything |journal=[[Harvard Business Review]] |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=63–72 |url=http://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything |quote=Lean start-up practices aren't just for young tech ventures. Large companies, such as GE and Intuit, have begun to implement them.... Over the years managerial experts such as Clayton Christensen, Rita McGrath, Vijay Govindarajan, Henry Chesbrough, Ian MacMillan, Alexander Osterwalder, and Eric von Hippel have advanced the thinking on how large companies can improve their innovation processes. During the past three years, however, we have seen large companies, including General Electric, Qualcomm, and Intuit, begin to implement the lean start-up methodology.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

===Definitions based on ''The Lean Startup''===
In his blog and book ''[[The Lean Startup]]'', entrepreneur [[Eric Ries]] used specific terms to refer to the core lean startup principles.

====Minimum viable product====
A [[minimum viable product]] (MVP) is the "version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort" (similar to a [[pilot experiment]]).&lt;ref name="leanstartupbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ries |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Ries |date=3 August 2009 |title=The lean startup |url=http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html |website=startuplessonslearned.com |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tokareva |first1=Julia |date=27 February 2018 |title=What is a minimum viable product, and why do companies need them? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/02/27/what-is-a-minimum-viable-product-and-why-do-companies-need-them/ |website=Forbes.com |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of an MVP is to test fundamental business hypotheses (or leap-of-faith assumptions) and to help entrepreneurs begin the learning process as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name="leanstartupbook"/&gt;

As an example, Ries noted that [[Zappos]] founder [[Nick Swinmurn]] wanted to test the hypothesis that customers were ready and willing to buy shoes online.&lt;ref name="leanstartupbook"/&gt;{{rp|57–58}} Instead of building a website and a large database of footwear, Swinmurn approached local shoe stores, took pictures of their inventory, posted the pictures online, bought the shoes from the stores at full price after he'd made a sale, and then shipped them directly to customers. Swinmurn deduced that customer demand was present, and Zappos would eventually grow into a billion dollar business based on the model of selling shoes online.&lt;ref name="leanstartupbook"/&gt;{{rp|57–58}}

====Continuous deployment (only for software development)====
Continuous deployment, similar to [[continuous delivery]], is a process "whereby all code that is written for an application is immediately deployed into production," which results in a reduction of [[Cycle time variation|cycle time]]s.&lt;ref name="oreillyradarcontinuousdeployment"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ries |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Ries |date=30 March 2009 |title=Continuous deployment in 5 easy steps |url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/03/continuous-deployment-5-eas.html |website=radar.oreilly.com |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ries stated that some of the companies he's worked with deploy new code into production as often as 50 times a day.&lt;ref name="oreillyradarcontinuousdeployment"/&gt; The phrase was coined by Timothy Fitz, one of Ries's colleagues and an early engineer at [[IMVU]].&lt;ref name="leanstartupbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fitz |first=Timothy |date=10 February 2009 |title=Continuous deployment at IMVU: doing the impossible fifty times a day |url=http://timothyfitz.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/continuous-deployment-at-imvu-doing-the-impossible-fifty-times-a-day/ |website=timothyfitz.wordpress.com |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Split testing====
A split or [[A/B testing|A/B test]] is an experiment in which "different versions of a product are offered to customers at the same time."&lt;ref name="leanstartupbook"/&gt; The goal of a split test is to observe differences in behavior between the two groups and to measure the impact of each version on an actionable metric.

A/B testing is sometimes incorrectly performed in serial fashion, where a group of users one week may see one version of the product while the next week users see another. This undermines the statistical validity of the results, since external events may influence user behavior in one time period but not the other. For example, a split test of two ice cream flavors performed in serial during the summer and winter would see a marked decrease in demand during the winter where that decrease is mostly related to the weather and not to the flavor offer.

Another way to incorrectly A/B test is to assign users to one or another A/B version of the product using any non-random method.

====Actionable metrics====
Actionable metrics can lead to informed business decisions and subsequent action.&lt;ref name="leanstartupbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="4hww"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ries |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Ries |date=19 May 2009 |title=Vanity metrics vs. actionable metrics |url=http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/05/19/vanity-metrics-vs-actionable-metrics/ |website=fourhourworkweek.com |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are in contrast to vanity metrics—measurements that give "the rosiest picture possible" but do not accurately reflect the key drivers of a business.

Vanity metrics for one company may be actionable metrics for another. For example, a company specializing in creating web based dashboards for financial markets might view the number of web [[page view]]s&lt;ref name="techcrunch"/&gt; per person as a vanity metric as their revenue is not based on number of page views. However, an online magazine with advertising would view web page views as a key metric as page views are directly correlated to revenue.

A typical example of a vanity metric is "the number of new users gained per day". While a high number of users gained per day seems beneficial to any company, if the cost of acquiring each user through expensive advertising campaigns is significantly higher than the revenue gained per user, then gaining more users could quickly lead to bankruptcy.

====Pivot====
A pivot is a "structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, and engine of growth."&lt;ref name="leanstartupbook"/&gt; A notable example of a company employing the pivot is [[Groupon]]; when the company first started, it was an online activism platform called The Point.&lt;ref name="fastcompany"/&gt; After receiving almost no traction, the founders opened a [[WordPress]] blog and launched their first coupon promotion for a pizzeria located in their building lobby.&lt;ref name="fastcompany"/&gt; Although they only received 20 redemptions, the founders realized that their idea was significant, and had successfully empowered people to coordinate group action.&lt;ref name="fastcompany"/&gt; Three years later, Groupon would grow into a billion dollar business.

[[Steve Blank]] defines a pivot as "changing (or even firing) the plan instead of the executive (the sales exec, marketing or even the CEO)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blank |first1=Steven G. |authorlink1=Steve Blank |last2=Dorf |first2=Bob |date=2012 |title=The startup owner's manual: the step-by-step guide for building a great company |location=Pescadero, CA |publisher=K&amp;S Ranch, Inc. |isbn=9780984999309 |oclc=780144160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blank |first1=Steven G. |authorlink1=Steve Blank |date=17 May 2014 |title=Startup Wisdom: Steve Blank, Consulting Associate Professor of Stanford University |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzWRKBdEJYo |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=4 June 2015}} Talk given in May 2013; the audience is composed of the CEOs of the portfolio companies of [[Khosla Ventures]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Innovation accounting====
This topic focuses on how entrepreneurs can maintain accountability and maximize outcomes by measuring progress, planning milestones, and prioritizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ries |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Ries |date=1 June 2012 |title=Innovation accounting: secret to fast growth |url=http://www.inc.com/eric-ries/entrepreneur-eric-ries-innovation-accounting-secret-to-fast-growth.html |publisher=[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc. Live]] |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic was later expanded upon to include three levels of innovation accounting related to the types of assumptions being validated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kaplan |first=Soren |date=11 December 2017 |title=Lean startup's newest tool is a game changer for innovators |url=https://www.inc.com/soren-kaplan/lean-start-ups-newest-tool-is-a-game-changer-for-all-innovators.html |publisher=[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc. Live]] |accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Build-Measure-Learn&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Decision cycle]]: do not rename heading without fixing incoming link ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;====
The Build–Measure–Learn loop emphasizes speed as a critical ingredient to product development. A team or company's effectiveness is determined by its ability to ideate, quickly build a [[minimum viable product]] of that idea, measure its effectiveness in the market, and learn from that experiment. In other words, it's a [[learning cycle]] of turning ideas into products, measuring customers' reactions and behaviors against built products, and then deciding whether to persevere or pivot the idea; this process repeats as many times as necessary. The phases of the loop are: Ideas → '''Build''' → Product → '''Measure''' → Data → '''Learn'''.&lt;ref name="runninglean"&gt;{{cite book |last=Maurya |first=Ash |date=2012 |origyear=2010 |title=Running lean: iterate from plan A to a plan that works |edition=2nd |series=The lean series |location=Sebastopol, CA |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] |isbn=9781449305178 |oclc=759911462 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j4hXPn233UYC |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=j4hXPn233UYC&amp;pg=PA12 12]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This rapid iteration allows teams to discover a feasible path towards [[product/market fit]], and to continue optimizing and refining the business model after reaching product/market fit.&lt;ref name="runninglean"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kromer |first=Tristan |date=23 February 2012 |title=Build Measure Learn vs. Learn Measure Build |url=http://grasshopperherder.com/build-measure-learn-vs-learn-measure-build/ |website=grasshopperherder.com |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business model templates&lt;!--Section linked from [[Business Model Canvas]]: do not rename without fixing incoming link (see [[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;===

====Business Model Canvas====
{{main|Business Model Canvas}}
The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management template invented by [[Alexander Osterwalder]] around 2008 for developing new business models or documenting existing ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Osterwalder |first=Alexander |authorlink=Alexander Osterwalder |date=2 July 2008 |title=What is a business model? |url=http://business-model-design.blogspot.com/2008/07/what-is-business-model.html |website=business-model-design.blogspot.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906034734/http://business-model-design.blogspot.com/2008/07/what-is-business-model.html |archivedate=6 September 2008 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a visual chart with elements describing a firm's [[value proposition]], infrastructure, customers, and finances. It assists firms in aligning their activities by illustrating potential trade-offs.&lt;ref name="BMG"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Osterwalder |first1=Alexander |authorlink1= Alexander Osterwalder |last2=Pigneur |first2=Yves |authorlink2=Yves Pigneur |last3=Clark |first3=Tim |title=Business model generation: a handbook for visionaries, game changers, and challengers |year=2010 |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=9780470876411 |oclc=648031756 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L3TnC7ZAWAsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The template consists of nine blocks: activities, partners, resources, value proposition, customers, customer channels, customer relationships, costs and revenue.&lt;ref name="BMG"/&gt; Startups use the template (and/or other templates described below) to formulate hypotheses and change their business model based on the success or failure of tested hypotheses.

The Lean Canvas is a version of the Business Model Canvas adapted by Ash Maurya in 2010 specifically for startups.&lt;ref name="runninglean"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Maurya |first=Ash |date=11 August 2010 |title=How I Document my business model hypotheses |url=http://www.ashmaurya.com/2010/08/businessmodelcanvas/ |website=ashmaurya.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815074344/http://www.ashmaurya.com/2010/08/businessmodelcanvas/ |archivedate=15 August 2010 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lean Canvas focuses on addressing broad customer problems and solutions and delivering them to customer segments through a unique value proposition.&lt;ref name="whyleancanvas"&gt;{{cite web |last=Maurya |first=Ash |date=27 February 2012 |title=Why Lean Canvas vs Business Model Canvas? |url=http://leanstack.com/why-lean-canvas/ |website=leanstack.com |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Problem" and "solution" blocks replace the "key partners" and "key activities" blocks in the Business Model Canvas, while "key metrics" and "unfair advantage" blocks replace the "key resources" and "customer relationships" blocks, respectively.&lt;ref name="runninglean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whyleancanvas"/&gt;

=====Value Proposition Canvas=====
The Value Proposition Canvas is a supplement to the Business Model Canvas ("customer segment" and "value proposition" blocks) published in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Osterwalder |first=Alexander |authorlink=Alexander Osterwalder |date=29 August 2012 |title=Achieve product–market fit with our brand-new Value Proposition Designer Canvas |url=http://businessmodelalchemist.com/blog/2012/08/achieve-product-market-fit-with-our-brand-new-value-proposition-designer.html |website=businessmodelalchemist.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607230851/http://businessmodelalchemist.com/blog/2012/08/achieve-product-market-fit-with-our-brand-new-value-proposition-designer.html |archivedate=7 June 2013 |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to address the customer–product relationship, the perceived value of the product or service, and potential [[product/market fit]].&lt;ref name="VPD"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Osterwalder |first1=Alexander |authorlink1=Alexander Osterwalder |last2=Pigneur |first2=Yves |authorlink2=Yves Pigneur |last3=Bernarda |first3=Gregory |last4=Smith |first4=Alan |date=2014 |title=Value proposition design: how to create products and services customers want |series=Strategyzer series |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=9781118968055 |oclc=894271736}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "value proposition" block is divided into three categories—products and services, gain creators, and pain relievers—that correspond to three categories in the "customer segment" block—customer jobs, gains, and pains.&lt;ref name="VPD"/&gt;

=====Mission Model Canvas=====
The Mission Model Canvas is a version of the Business Model Canvas developed by Alexander Osterwalder and Steve Blank for entities such as [[government agencies]] that have a predetermined budget instead of a goal of raising revenue.&lt;ref name="MMC"&gt;The Mission Model Canvas was introduced in a joint blog post published on the blog of Osterwalder's consulting firm Strategyzer and on Blank's blog: {{cite web |last1=Blank |first1=Steven G. |authorlink=Steve Blank |title=The Mission Model Canvas: an adapted Business Model Canvas for mission-driven organizations |url=https://steveblank.com/2016/02/23/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations/ |website=steveblank.com |date=23 February 2016 |accessdate=16 October 2018}} And: {{cite web |last=Osterwalder |first=Alexander |authorlink=Alexander Osterwalder |title=The Mission Model Canvas: an adapted Business Model Canvas for mission-driven organizations |url=https://blog.strategyzer.com/posts/2016/2/24/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations |website=blog.strategyzer.com |date=25 February 2016 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in 2016.&lt;ref name="MMC"/&gt; Earlier publications by Osterwalder and colleagues had suggested how to adapt the Business Model Canvas for nonprofit enterprises that depend on raising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Osterwalder |first=Alexander |authorlink=Alexander Osterwalder |date=27 August 2009 |title=Business models beyond profit—social entrepreneurship lecture |url=http://businessmodelalchemist.com/blog/2009/08/business-models-beyond-profit-social.html |website=businessmodelalchemist.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404022409/http://businessmodelalchemist.com/blog/2009/08/business-models-beyond-profit-social.html |archivedate=4 April 2014 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BMG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Tim |last2=Osterwalder |first2=Alexander |authorlink2=Alexander Osterwalder |last3=Pigneur |first3=Yves |authorlink3=Yves Pigneur |date=2012 |title=Business model you: a one-page method for reinventing your career |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=9781118156315 |oclc=751834016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mission budget/cost" and "mission achievement/impact factors" blocks replace the "cost structure" and "revenue streams" blocks in the Business Model Canvas, while "beneficiaries", "buy-in/support" and "deployment" blocks replace the "customer segments", "customer relationships" and "channels" blocks, respectively.&lt;ref name="MMC"/&gt;

==The movement==
Ries and others created an annual technology conference called Startup Lessons Learned which has subsequently changed its name to the Lean Startup Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ries |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Ries |date=27 June 2012 |title=Announcing the 2012 Lean Startup Conference in SF |url=http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2012/06/announcing-2012-lean-startup-conference.html |website=startuplessonslearned.com |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lean startup meetups in cities around the world have garnered 20,000 regular participants.&lt;ref name="xconomy"/&gt; The first lean startup meetup named Lean Startup Circle was created by Rich Collins on June 26, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Lean Startup Circle |url=http://www.leanstartupcircle.com/about |website=leanstartupcircle.com |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosting speaking events, workshops, and roundtable discussions.

===In government===
The [[United States Government]] has employed lean startup ideas. The [[Federal Chief Information Officer of the United States]], [[Steven VanRoekel]] noted in 2012 that he was taking a "lean-startup approach to government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schreiber |first=Danny |date=5 April 2012 |title=U.S. CIO VanRoekel talks startups, savings, new tech in Iowa visit |newspaper=Silicon Prairie News |url=http://siliconprairienews.com/2012/04/u-s-cio-vanroekel-talks-startups-savings-new-tech-in-iowa-visit/ |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ries has worked with the former and current [[Chief Technology Officer of the United States|Chief Technology Officers of the United States]]—[[Aneesh Chopra]] and [[Todd Park]] respectively—to implement aspects of the lean startup model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ries |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Ries |date=30 May 2012 |title=Lean government |url=http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2012/05/lean-government.html |website=startuplessonslearned.com |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McKendrick |first=Joe |date=28 October 2011 |title=In search of the US government's inner 'startup': federal CIO |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/in-search-of-the-us-governments-inner-startup-federal-cio/ |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Park noted that in order to understand customer demand, the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] recognized "the need to rapidly prototype solutions, engage customers in those solutions as soon as possible, and then quickly and repeatedly iterate those solutions based on working with customers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=10 April 2012 |title=Making a difference: innovation pathway and entrepreneurs in residence: interview with Todd Park, Chief Technology Officer of the United States |url=http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2012/04/making-a-difference-innovation-pathway-and-entrepreneurs-in-residence/ |website=blogs.fda.gov |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foley |first=John |date=30 April 2012 |title=Busting through the federal IT budget ceiling |journal=[[InformationWeek]] |url=http://www.informationweek.com/government/leadership/busting-through-the-federal-it-budget-ceiling/d/d-id/1104106 |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, Ries and [[The White House]] announced the [[Presidential Innovation Fellows]] program, which brings together top citizen innovators and government officials to work on high-level projects and deliver measurable results in six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Park |first=Todd |date=23 May 2012 |title=Wanted: a few good women and men to serve as presidential innovation fellows |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/05/23/wanted-few-good-women-and-men-serve-presidential-innovation-fellows |publisher=[[The White House]] |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hacking for Defense====
Steve Blank, working with retired [[United States Army]] colonel Pete Newell and former [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]] colonel Joe Felter, adapted lean startup principles for U.S. government innovation under the moniker "Hacking for Defense", a program in which university students solve problems that the [[Department of Defense]], the [[United States Armed Forces]], and the [[United States Intelligence Community]] submit to participating universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ricks |first=Thomas E. |date=25 January 2017 |title=A neat new way to attack military problems: 'Hacking for Defense' |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/25/a-neat-new-way-to-attack-military-problems-hacking-for-defense/ |publisher=[[Foreign Policy]] |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Blank |first=Steven G. |authorlink=Steve Blank |date=19 July 2017 |title=National Security Innovation just got a major boost in Washington |url=https://steveblank.com/2017/07/19/national-security-innovation-just-got-a-major-boost-in-washington/ |website=steveblank.com |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Satell |first1=Greg |date=8 July 2018 |title=This army colonel is showing large enterprises how to innovate like lean startups |url=https://www.inc.com/greg-satell/this-army-colonel-is-showing-large-enterprises-how-to-innovate-like-lean-startups.html |website=[[Inc.com]] |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hacking for Defense and variants like Hacking for Diplomacy have expanded to the [[United States Department of State]], [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], [[NASA]], and nonprofits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Perry |first=Tekla S. |date=25 July 2017 |title=U.S. defense budget may help fund 'Hacking for Defense' classes at universities |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/at-work/education/us-defense-budget-may-help-fund-university-hacking-for-defense-classes |website=spectrum.ieee.org |publisher=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Perry |first=Tekla S. |date=4 January 2018 |title=First Hacking for Impact class buzzes around the mosquito problem |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/at-work/education/first-hacking-for-impact-class-buzzes-around-the-mosquito-problem |website=spectrum.ieee.org |publisher=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The lean startup methodology was first proposed in 2008 by [[Eric Ries]], using his personal experiences adapting lean management and customer development principles to [[High tech|high-tech]] [[startup companies]].&lt;ref name="riesblog"&gt;In September 2008, Ries coined the term ''lean startup'' on his blog, ''Startup Lessons Learned'': {{cite web |last=Ries |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Ries |date=8 September 2008 |title=The lean startup |url=http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/lean-startup.html |website=startuplessonslearned.com |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web |last=Loizos |first=Connie |date=26 May 2011 |title='Lean Startup' evangelist Eric Ries is just getting started |url=https://www.pehub.com/2011/05/eric-ries-is-just-getting-started/ |website=PeHUB |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inc"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ries |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Ries |date=October 2011 |title=Creating the Lean Startup |journal=[[Inc.

Ries' said that his first company, Catalyst Recruiting, failed because he and his colleagues did not understand the wants of their target customers, and because they focused too much time and energy on the initial product launch.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thisweekinventurecapital"&gt;{{cite web |title=Venture Capital: Eric Ries, author of 'The Lean Startup' |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMysvIXmbl0 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=21 November 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, Ries was a senior software engineer with There, Inc.,&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thisweekinventurecapital"/&gt; which Ries described as a classic example of a Silicon Valley startup with five years of stealth [[Research and development|R&amp;D]], $40 million in financing, and nearly 200 employees at the time of product launch.&lt;ref name="thisweekinventurecapital"/&gt; In 2003, There, Inc. launched its product, [[There.com]], but they were unable to garner popularity beyond the initial [[early adopter]]s.&lt;ref name="thisweekinventurecapital"/&gt; Ries claimed that despite the many proximate causes for failure, the most important mistake was that the company's "vision was almost too concrete", making it impossible to see that their product did not accurately represent consumer demand.&lt;ref name="thisweekinventurecapital"/&gt;

Although the lost money differed by orders of magnitude, Ries concluded that the failures of There, Inc. and Catalyst Recruiting shared similar origins: "it was working forward from the technology instead of working backward from the business results you're trying to achieve."&lt;ref name="xconomy"/&gt;

After Ries later co-founded [[IMVU]] Inc., IMVU investor [[Steve Blank]] insisted that IMVU executives audit Blank's class on entrepreneurship at [[UC Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="wiredupstart"/&gt; Ries applied Blank's customer development methodology and integrated it with ideas from [[lean software development]] and elsewhere to form the lean startup methodology.&lt;ref name="riesblog"/&gt;

==Criticism ==
[[Ben Horowitz]], the co-founder of venture capital firm [[Andreessen Horowitz]], wrote an article in 2010 criticizing the lean startup method for over-emphasizing "running lean" (constantly cutting and reducing non-essential parts of the company to save time and money). He specifically disagreed with portraying "running lean" as an end rather than a means to winning the market without running out of cash. Horowitz gave as an example his startup [[Loudcloud]], which by "running fat" was able to outperform 20 direct competitors and after 8 years reach a value of $1.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Horowitz |first=Ben |date=17 March 2010 |title=The case for the fat start-up |url=http://allthingsd.com/20100317/the-case-for-the-fat-startup/ |website=allthingsd.com |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at least since 2008, numerous advocates of lean methods have pointed out that "running lean" does not mean cost cutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trent |first=Robert J. |date=2008 |title=End-to-end lean management: a guide to complete supply chain improvement |location=Ft.

As an end result, cost is not something that can be directly impacted. Or at least we do not have an impact on it in the traditional "cost-cutting" ways, which typically have meant layoffs and possibly the scaling back of services provided to our community. Lean hospitals focus on reducing waste, not cutting costs. Lean organizations also focus on the customers (the patients) and the value that is being delivered to them. In this way, Lean is not focused on doing less but rather on delivering the right amount of value. If we are reducing waste, we can often provide more value while expending less effort and less cost.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sarkar |first=Debashis |date=2012 |title=Lessons in lean management: 53 ideas to transform services |location=Chennai |publisher=Westland |isbn=9789381626801 |oclc=821263409 |page=[//books.google.com/books?id=dEieGznWd0EC&amp;pg=PA4 4] |quote=Organizations often view Lean as purely a cost-cutting tool.

Trey Griffith, the VP of technology at Teleborder, stated in 2012 that the majority of backing for the lean startup methodology was anecdotal and had not been rigorously validated when first presented. However, he goes on to note that better support of the method comes out of a 2011 analysis of the factors of success in growth companies as described in the 2011 book ''Great by Choice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Griffith |first=Trey |date=17 January 2012 |title=Empirically validating the lean startup: making a startup great by choice |website=tgriff3.com |url=http://tgriff3.com/post/16007830705/empirically-validating-the-lean-startup-making-a&amp;bwsCriterion=anecdo&amp;bwsMatch=1 |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Finneran, a business writer and former user of the lean startup method, described in 2013 a number of the method's assumptions that he did not recognize during his use of the method. In particular, he observed that his clients were often not motivated to invest time and effort into helping iterate a minimal viable product; instead they wanted a more polished product to begin with. Second, he found virtually no early adopters who were willing to try to give feedback on unpolished software simply to be the first to get a chance at it. Third, he argued that lean startup can distract from essential traditional management practices like development discipline and budget protection. In general, he stated that it is important to be critical and skeptical of lean startup methods rather than pre-supposing that they will be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Finneran |first=John |date=1 April 2013 |title=The Fat Startup: lessons from my failed Lean Startup |website=johnffinneran.com |url=http://www.johnffinneran.com/blog/fat-startup-learn-the-lessons |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ries had already anticipated this criticism in his book: "We cannot afford to have our success breed a new pseudoscience around pivots, MVPs, and the like. This was the fate of scientific management, and in the end, I believe, that set back its cause by decades."&lt;ref name="leanstartupbook"/&gt;{{rp|279}} This implies that the concept of [[validated learning]] applies to the lean startup methods themselves, and not just to products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maurya |first=Ash |date=2012 |origyear=2010 |title=Running lean: iterate from plan A to a plan that works |edition=2nd |series=The lean series |location=Sebastopol, CA |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] |isbn=9781449305178 |oclc=759911462 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=j4hXPn233UYC&amp;pg=PR28 xxviii] |quote=One of the things that particularly drew me to the Lean Startup methodology is that it is a metaprocess from which more specific processes and practices can be formulated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17461">[[File:Cyclope robot.jpg|thumb|right|Robot in a wooden maze]]
There are a number of different '''maze solving [[algorithm]]s''', that is, automated methods for the solving of [[maze]]s. The random mouse, wall follower, Pledge, and Trémaux's [[algorithms]] are designed to be used inside the maze by a traveler with no prior knowledge of the maze, whereas the [[Cul-de-sac|dead-end]] filling and [[shortest path algorithm]]s are designed to be used by a person or computer program that can see the whole maze at once.

Mazes containing no loops are known as "simply connected", or "perfect" mazes, and are equivalent to a [[Tree (graph theory)|''tree'']] in graph theory. Thus many maze solving algorithms are closely related to [[graph theory]]. Intuitively, if one pulled and stretched out the paths in the maze in the proper way, the result could be made to resemble a tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|k1tSK5V1pds|Maze to Tree}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Random mouse algorithm  ==
This is a trivial method that can be implemented by a very unintelligent [[robot]] or perhaps a mouse. It is simply to proceed following the current passage until a junction is reached, and then to make a random decision about the next direction to follow. Although such a method would always [[Las Vegas algorithm|eventually find the right solution]], this algorithm can be extremely slow.

== Wall follower ==
[[File:maze01-02.png|left|frame|Traversal using ''right-hand rule'']]
[[File:MAZE.png|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Maze with two solutions]]
[[File:MAZE solution.png|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Solution to above maze. The solution is the boundary between the connected components of the wall of the maze, each represented by a different color.]]
The wall follower, the best-known rule for traversing mazes, is also known as either the ''left-hand rule'' or the ''right-hand rule''. If the maze is [[Simply connected space|''simply connected'']], that is, all its walls are connected together or to the maze's outer boundary, then by keeping one hand in contact with one wall of the maze the solver is guaranteed not to get lost and will reach a different exit if there is one; otherwise, he or she will return to the entrance having traversed every corridor next to that connected section of walls at least once.

Another perspective into why wall following works is topological. If the walls are connected, then they may be deformed into a loop or circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|IIBwiGrUgzc|Maze Transformed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then wall following reduces to walking around a circle from start to finish. To further this idea, notice that by grouping together connected components of the maze walls, the boundaries between these are precisely the solutions, even if there is more than one solution (see figures on the right).

If the maze is not simply-connected (i.e. if the start or endpoints are in the center of the structure surrounded by passage loops, or the pathways cross over and under each other and such parts of the solution path are surrounded by passage loops), this method will not reach the goal.

Another concern is that care should be taken to begin wall-following at the entrance to the maze. If the maze is not simply-connected and one begins wall-following at an arbitrary point inside the maze, one could find themselves trapped along a separate wall that loops around on itself and containing no entrances or exits.  Should it be the case that wall-following begins late, attempt to mark the position in which wall-following began. Because wall-following will always lead you back to where you started, if you come across your starting point a second time, you can conclude the maze is not simply-connected, and you should switch to an alternative wall not yet followed. See the ''Pledge Algorithm'', below, for an alternative methodology.

Wall-following can be done in 3D or higher-dimensional mazes if its higher-dimensional passages can be projected onto the 2D plane in a deterministic manner. For example, if in a 3D maze "up" passages can be assumed to lead northwest, and "down" passages can be assumed to lead southeast, then standard wall following rules can apply. However, unlike in 2D, this requires that the current orientation be known, to determine which direction is the first on the left or right.

== Pledge algorithm ==
[[File:Pledge Algorithm.png|left|thumb| Left: Left-turn solver trapped &lt;br /&gt; Right: Pledge algorithm solution]]
Disjoint{{huh?|date=March 2017}} mazes can be solved with the wall follower method, so long as the entrance and exit to the maze are on the outer walls of the maze. If however, the solver starts inside the maze, it might be on a section disjoint from the exit, and wall followers will continually go around their ring. The Pledge algorithm (named after [[Jon Pledge]] of [[Exeter]]) can solve this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Turtle Geometry: the computer as a medium for exploring mathematics|last1=Abelson|last2=diSessa|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Papert, [ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-298.pdf "Uses of Technology to Enhance Education"], ''MIT Artificial Intelligence Memo No. 298'', June 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pledge algorithm, designed to circumvent obstacles, requires an arbitrarily chosen direction to go toward, which will be preferential. When an obstacle is met, one hand (say the right hand) is kept along the obstacle while the angles turned are counted (clockwise  turn is positive, counter-clockwise turn is negative). When the solver is facing the original preferential direction again, and the angular sum of the turns made is 0, the solver leaves the obstacle and continues moving in its original direction.

The hand is removed from the wall only when both "sum of turns made" and "current heading" are at zero. This allows the algorithm to avoid traps shaped like an upper case letter "G". Assuming the algorithm turns left at the first wall, one gets turned around a full 360 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s by the walls. An algorithm that only keeps track of "current heading" leads into an infinite loop as it leaves the lower rightmost wall heading left and runs into the curved section on the left hand side again. The Pledge algorithm does not leave the rightmost wall due to the "sum of turns made" not being zero at that point (note 360 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s is not equal to 0 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s). It follows the wall all the way around, finally leaving it heading left outside and just underneath the letter shape.

This algorithm allows a person with a compass to find their way from any point inside to an outer exit of any finite two-dimensional maze, regardless of the initial position of the solver. However, this algorithm will not work in doing the reverse, namely finding the way from an entrance on the outside of a maze to some end goal within it.

== Trémaux's algorithm ==
[[File:Tremaux Maze Solving Algorithm.gif|thumb| Trémaux's algorithm. The large green dot shows the current position, the small blue dots show single marks on paths, and the red crosses show double marks. Once the exit is found, the route is traced through the singly-marked paths.]]
Trémaux's algorithm, invented by [[Charles Pierre Trémaux]],&lt;ref&gt;Public conference, December 2, 2010 – by professor Jean Pelletier-Thibert in Academie de Macon (Burgundy – France) – (Abstract published in the Annals academic, March 2011 – {{ISSN|0980-6032}}) &lt;br/&gt;Charles Tremaux (° 1859 – † 1882) Ecole Polytechnique of Paris (X:1876), French engineer of the telegraph&lt;/ref&gt; is an efficient method to find the way out of a maze that requires drawing lines on the floor to mark a path, and is guaranteed to work for all mazes that have well-defined passages.&lt;ref name="Récréations Mathématiques"&gt;Édouard Lucas: ''Récréations Mathématiques'' Volume I, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;
A path from a junction is either unvisited, marked once or marked twice. The algorithm works according to the following rules:
* Mark each path once, when you follow it. The marks need to be visible at both ends of the path. Therefore, if they are being made as physical marks, rather than stored as part of a computer algorithm, the same mark should be made at both ends of the path.
* Never enter a path which has two marks on it.
* If you arrive at a junction that has no marks (except possibly for the one on the path by which you entered), choose an arbitrary unmarked path, follow it, and mark it.
* Otherwise:
** If the path you came in on has only one mark, turn around and return along that path, marking it again. In particular this case should occur whenever you reach a dead end.
** If not, choose arbitrarily one of the remaining paths with the fewest marks (zero if possible, else one), follow that path, and mark it.
When you finally reach the solution, paths marked exactly once will indicate a way back to the start. If there is no exit, this method will take you back to the start where all paths are marked twice.
In this case each path is walked down exactly twice, once in each direction. The resulting [[Glossary of graph theory#Walks|walk]] is called a bidirectional double-tracing.&lt;ref name="Eulerian Graphs and related Topics"&gt;H. Fleischner: ''Eulerian Graphs and related Topics.'' In: ''Annals of Discrete Mathematics'' No. 50 Part 1 Volume 2, 1991, page X20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, this algorithm, which was discovered in the 19th century, has been used about a hundred years later as [[depth-first search]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Graph Algorithms|first=Shimon|last=Even|authorlink=Shimon Even|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-521-73653-4|pages=46–48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3QTSMYm5rkC&amp;pg=PA46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Algorithms in C++: Graph Algorithms|first=Robert|last=Sedgewick|edition=3rd|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2002|isbn=978-0-201-36118-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dead-end filling ==
Dead-end filling is an algorithm for solving mazes that fills all dead ends, leaving only the correct ways unfilled. It can be used for solving mazes on paper or with a computer program, but it is not useful to a person inside an unknown maze since this method looks at the entire maze at once. The method is to 1) find all of the dead-ends in the maze, and then 2) "fill in" the path from each dead-end until the first junction is met. Note that some passages won't become parts of dead end passages until other dead ends are removed first. A video of dead-end filling in action can be seen here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqZDYcpCGAI][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkueaIT6RSU].

Dead-end filling cannot accidentally "cut off" the start from the finish since each step of the process preserves the topology of the maze. Furthermore, the process won't stop "too soon" since the end result cannot contain any dead-ends. Thus if dead-end filling is done on a perfect maze (maze with no loops), then only the solution will remain. If it is done on a partially braid maze (maze with some loops), then every possible solution will remain but nothing more. [http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm]

== Recursive algorithm ==
If given an omniscient view of the maze, a simple recursive algorithm can tell one how to get to the end. The algorithm will be given a starting X and Y value. If the X and Y values are not on a wall, the method will call itself with all adjacent X and Y values, making sure that it did not already use those X and Y values before. If the X and Y values are those of the end location, it will save all the previous instances of the method as the correct path. Here is a sample code in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
int[][] maze = new int[width][height]; // The maze
boolean[][] wasHere = new boolean[width][height];
boolean[][] correctPath = new boolean[width][height]; // The solution to the maze
int startX, startY; // Starting X and Y values of maze
int endX, endY;     // Ending X and Y values of maze

public void solveMaze() {
    maze = generateMaze(); // Create Maze (1 = path, 2 = wall)
    for (int row = 0; row &lt; maze.length; row++)  
        // Sets boolean Arrays to default values
        for (int col = 0; col &lt; maze[row].length; col++){
            wasHere[row][col] = false;
            correctPath[row][col] = false;
        }
    boolean b = recursiveSolve(startX, startY);
    // Will leave you with a boolean array (correctPath) 
    // with the path indicated by true values.
    // If b is false, there is no solution to the maze
}
public boolean recursiveSolve(int x, int y) {
    if (x == endX &amp;&amp; y == endY) return true; // If you reached the end
    if (maze[x][y] == 2 || wasHere[x][y]) return false;  
    // If you are on a wall or already were here
    wasHere[x][y] = true;
    if (x != 0) // Checks if not on left edge
        if (recursiveSolve(x-1, y)) { // Recalls method one to the left
            correctPath[x][y] = true; // Sets that path value to true;
            return true;
        }
    if (x != width - 1) // Checks if not on right edge
        if (recursiveSolve(x+1, y)) { // Recalls method one to the right
            correctPath[x][y] = true;
            return true;
        }
    if (y != 0)  // Checks if not on top edge
        if (recursiveSolve(x, y-1)) { // Recalls method one up
            correctPath[x][y] = true;
            return true;
        }
    if (y != height - 1) // Checks if not on bottom edge
        if (recursiveSolve(x, y+1)) { // Recalls method one down
            correctPath[x][y] = true;
            return true;
        }
    return false;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Maze-routing algorithm ==
The maze-routing algorithm &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fattah|first1=Mohammad|last2=et|first2=al.|title=A Low-Overhead, Fully-Distributed, Guaranteed-Delivery Routing Algorithm for Faulty Network-on-Chips|journal=NOCS '15 Proceedings of the 9th International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip|date=2015-09-28|doi=10.1145/2786572.2786591|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2786591}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a low overhead method to find the way between any two locations of the maze. The algorithm is initially proposed for [[Chip multiprocessor|chip multiprocessors]] (CMPs) domain and guarantees to work for any grid-based maze. In addition to finding paths between two location of the grid (maze), the algorithm can detect when there is no path between the source and destination. Also, the algorithm is to be used by an inside traveler with no prior knowledge of the maze with fixed memory complexity regardless of the maze size; requiring 4 variables in total for finding the path and detecting the unreachable locations. Nevertheless, the algorithm is not to find the shortest path.

Maze-routing algorithm uses the notion of [[Manhattan distance]] (MD) and relies on the property of grids that the MD increments/decrements ''exactly'' by 1 when moving from one location to any 4 neighboring locations. Here is the pseudocode without the capability to detect unreachable locations.
&lt;source lang="C++"&gt;
Point src, dst;// Source and destination coordinates
// cur also indicates the coordinates of the current location
int MD_best = MD(src, dst);// It stores the closest MD we ever had to dst
// A productive path is the one that makes our MD to dst smaller
while(cur != dst){
    if(there exists a productive path){
        Take the productive path;
    }else{
        MD_best = MD(cur, dst);
        Imagine a line between cur and dst;
        Take the first path in the left/right of the line;// The left/right selection affects the following hand rule
        while(MD(cur, dst) != MD_best || there does not exist a productive path){
            Follow the right-hand/left-hand rule;// The opposite of the selected side of the line
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Shortest path algorithm ==
[[File:MAZE 40x20 DFS no deadends.png|thumb|A maze with many solutions and no dead-ends, where it may be useful to find the shortest path]]
When a maze has multiple solutions, the solver may want to find the shortest path from start to finish. There are several algorithms to find shortest paths, most of them coming from [[graph theory]]. One possible algorithm finds the shortest path by implementing a [[breadth-first search]], while another, the [[A* algorithm]], uses a [[heuristic]] technique. The breadth-first search algorithm uses a [[queue (data structure)|queue]] to visit cells in increasing distance order from the start until the finish is reached. Each visited cell needs to keep track of its distance from the start or which adjacent cell nearer to the start caused it to be added to the queue. When the finish location is found, follow the path of cells backwards to the start, which is the shortest path. The breadth-first search in its simplest form has its limitations, like finding the shortest path in weighted graphs.

A '''mechanical biological treatment''' system is a type of waste processing facility that combines a sorting facility with a form of biological treatment such as [[composting]] or [[anaerobic digestion]]. MBT plants are designed to process [[municipal solid waste|mixed household waste]] as well as [[commercial waste|commercial]] and [[industrial waste]]s.

==Process==
[[File:Mechanical biological treatment flowchart.svg|right|thumbnail|350px|Process flow chart]]
The terms ''mechanical biological treatment'' or ''mechanical biological pre-treatment'' relate to a group of [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|solid waste treatment systems]]. These systems enable the recovery of materials contained within the [[mixed waste]] and facilitate the stabilisation of the [[biodegradable]] component of the material.&lt;ref&gt;Enviros (2006) [http://www.mbt.landfill-site.com/ Mechanical biological treatment website], ''www.mbt.landfill-site.com'', Waste Technology Home Page, Accessed 22.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juniper (2005) [http://www.juniper.co.uk/Publications/downloads.html MBT: A Guide for Decision Makers – Processes, Policies &amp; Markets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817181127/http://www.juniper.co.uk/Publications/downloads.html |date=2007-08-17 }}, ''www.juniper.co.uk'', (Project funding supplied by Sita Environmental Trust), Accessed 22.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;

The sorting component of the plants typically resemble a [[materials recovery facility]]. This component is either configured to recover the individual elements of the waste or produce a [[refuse-derived fuel]] that can be used for the generation of power.

The components of the mixed waste stream that can be recovered include:
*[[Ferrous metal]]
*[[Non-ferrous metal]]
* [[Plastic]]
* [[Glass]]

==Terminology==
MBT is also sometimes termed biological mechanical treatment (BMT), however this simply refers to the order of processing (i.e., the biological phase of the system precedes the mechanical sorting). MBT should not be confused with [[mechanical heat treatment]] (MHT).

== Mechanical sorting ==
{{See also|Materials recovery facility}}
[[Image:MBT sorting.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|Wet material recovery facility, [[Hiriya]], [[Israel]] ]]

The "mechanical" element is usually an automated mechanical [[sorting]] stage. This either removes [[recyclable]] elements from a mixed waste stream (such as metals, plastics, glass, and paper) or processes them. It typically involves factory style [[conveyor]]s, industrial [[magnet]]s, [[eddy current separators]], [[trommel]]s, [[Industrial shredder|shredders]], and other tailor made systems, or the sorting is done manually at hand picking stations. The mechanical element has a number of similarities to a [[materials recovery facility]] (MRF).&lt;ref&gt;Sita (2004) [http://www.sita.co.uk/assets/PP_MBT.pdf Sita Mechanical Biological Treatment Position Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908000656/http://www.sita.co.uk/assets/PP_MBT.pdf |date=2006-09-08 }}, ''www.sita.co.uk'', Accessed 22.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;

Some systems integrate a wet MRF to separate by density and flotation and to recover and wash the recyclable elements of the waste in a form that can be sent for recycling. MBT can alternatively process the waste to produce a high calorific fuel termed [[refuse derived fuel]] (RDF). RDF can be used in [[cement kiln]]s or thermal [[Combustion power plant|combustion power plants]] and is generally made up from plastics and biodegradable organic waste. Systems which are configured to produce RDF include the Herhof and Ecodeco processes. It is a common misconception that all MBT processes produce RDF; this is not the case, and depends strictly on system configuration and suitable local markets for MBT outputs.

== Biological processing ==
{{See also|composting|anaerobic digestion}}

[[Image:MBT anaerobicdigesters.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|Twin stage &amp; [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion]] (UASB) [[anaerobic digester]]s]]

The "biological" element refers to either:
*[[Anaerobic digestion]]
*[[Composting]]
*[[Biodrying]]

Anaerobic digestion harnesses anaerobic microorganisms to break down the [[biodegradable waste|biodegradable]] component of the waste to produce [[biogas]] and [[digestate|soil improver]]. The biogas can be used to generate [[electricity]] and [[heat]].

Biological can also refer to a composting stage. Here the organic component is broken down by naturally occurring aerobic microorganisms. They breakdown the waste into carbon dioxide and compost. There is no green energy produced by systems employing only composting treatment for the biodegradable waste.

In the case of biodrying, the waste material undergoes a period of rapid heating through the action of aerobic microbes. During this partial composting stage the heat generated by the microbes result in rapid drying of the waste. These systems are often configured to produce a refuse-derived fuel where a dry, light material is advantageous for later transport and combustion.

Some systems incorporate both anaerobic digestion and composting. This may either take the form of a full anaerobic digestion phase, followed by the maturation (composting) of the digestate. Alternatively a partial anaerobic digestion phase can be induced on water that is percolated through the raw waste, dissolving the readily available sugars, with the remaining material being sent to a [[windrow composting]] facility.

By processing the biodegradable waste either by anaerobic digestion or by [[compost]]ing MBT technologies help to reduce the contribution of [[greenhouse gas]]es to [[global warming]].

Usable wastes for this system:
*[[Municipal solid waste]]
*[[Commercial waste|Commercial]] and [[industrial waste]]
*[[Sewage sludge]]

Possible products of this system:
* Renewable fuel (biogas) leading to renewable power
* Recovered recycable materials such as metals, paper, plastics, glass etc.
*[[Digestate]] - an organic fertiliser and soil improver
*[[Carbon credit|Carbon credits]] – additional revenues
* High calorific fraction [[Refuse-derived fuel|refuse derived fuel]] - renewable fuel content dependent upon biological component
* Residual unusable materials prepared for their final safe treatment (e.g., [[incineration]] or [[gasification]]) and/or [[landfill]]

Further advantages:
* Small fraction of inert [[residual waste]]
* Reduction of the waste volume to be deposited to at least a half (density &gt; 1.3 t/m³), thus the lifetime of the landfill is at least twice as long as usually
* Utilisation of the [[leachate]] in the process
* [[Landfill gas]] not problematic as biological component of waste has been stabilised
* Daily covering of landfill not necessary

== Consideration of applications ==
MBT systems can form an integral part of a region's waste treatment infrastructure. These systems are typically integrated with [[kerbside collection]] schemes. In the event that a refuse-derived fuel is produced as a by-product then a combustion facility would be required. This could either be an incineration facility or a gasifier.

Alternatively MBT solutions can diminish the need for home separation and kerbside collection of recyclable elements of waste. This gives the ability of local authorities, municipalities and councils to reduce the use of waste vehicles on the roads and keep recycling rates high.

==Position of environmental groups==
[[Friends of the Earth]] suggests that the best environmental route for [[municipal solid waste|residual waste]] is to firstly maximise removal of remaining recyclable materials from the waste stream (such as metals, plastics and paper). The amount of waste remaining should be composted or anaerobically digested and disposed of to [[landfill]], unless sufficiently clean to be used as compost.

A report by Eunomia&lt;ref&gt;Eunomia (2006) [http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/changing_climate.pdf A changing climate for energy from waste?]&lt;/ref&gt; undertook a detailed analysis of the climate impacts of different residual waste technologies. It found that an MBT process that extracts both the metals and plastics prior to landfilling is one of the best options for dealing with our residual waste, and has a lower impact than either MBT processes producing RDF for incineration or incineration of waste without MBT.

Friends of the Earth does not support MBT plants that produce refuse derived fuel (RDF), and believes MBT processes should occur in small, localised treatment plants.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of the Earth (2008) [http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/mchnical_biolo_treatmnt.pdf Mechanical Biological Treatment Briefing], ''www.foe.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4248">The '''elastic membrane analogy''', also known as the '''soap-film analogy''', was first published by pioneering aerodynamicist [[Ludwig Prandtl]] in 1903.
&lt;ref&gt;Prandtl, L.: "Zur torsion von prismatischen stäben", Phys. Zeitschr., '''4''', pp. 758-770 (1903)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Love 1944, article 224, page 322.&lt;/ref&gt;
It describes the [[Stress (physics)|stress]] distribution on a long bar in [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]].  The cross section of the bar is constant along its length, and need not be circular. The [[differential equation]] that governs the stress distribution on the bar in torsion is of the same form as the equation governing the shape of a membrane under differential pressure.  Therefore, in order to discover the stress distribution on the bar, all one has to do is cut the shape of the cross section out of a piece of wood, cover it with a soap film, and apply a differential pressure across it.  Then the slope of the soap film at any area of the cross section is directly proportional to the stress in the bar at the same point on its cross section.

==Application to thin-walled, open cross sections==
While the membrane analogy allows the stress distribution on any cross section to be determined experimentally, it also allows the stress distribution on thin-walled, open cross sections to be determined by the same theoretical approach that describes the behavior of rectangular sections.  Using the membrane analogy, any thin-walled cross section can be "stretched out" into a rectangle without affecting the stress distribution under torsion.  The maximum shear stress, therefore, occurs at the edge of the midpoint of the stretched cross section, and is equal to &lt;math&gt;3T/bt^2&lt;/math&gt;, where T is the [[torque]] applied, b is the length of the stretched cross section, and t is the thickness of the cross section.

It can be shown that the [[differential equation]] for the [[deflection surface]] of a homogeneous membrane, subjected to uniform lateral pressure and with uniform surface tension and with the same outline as that of the [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of a bar under [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]], has the same form as that governing the stress distribution over the cross section of a bar under [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]].

This analogy was originally proposed by [[Ludwig Prandtl]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Prandtl, L.: "Zur torsion von prismatischen stäben", Phys. Z., '''4''', pp. 758-770 (1903).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other applications==

Prandtl's stretched-membrane concept was used extensively in the field of electron tube ("vacuum tube") design (1930's to 1960's) to model the trajectory of electrons within a device. The model is constructed by uniformly stretching a thin rubber sheet over a frame, and deforming the sheet upwards with physical models of electrodes, impressed into the sheet from below. The entire assembly is tilted, and steel balls (as electron analogs) rolled down the assembly and the trajectories noted. The curved surface surrounding the "electrodes" represents the complex increase in field strength as the electron-analog approaches the "electrode"; the upward distortion in the sheet is a close analogy to field strength.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35590">In [[mathematics]], a '''metric space''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] for which [[Metric (mathematics)|distances]]  between all [[Element (mathematics)|members]] of the set are defined. Those distances, taken together, are  called a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on the set. A metric on a space induces [[topological properties]] like [[open set|open]] and [[closed set]]s, which lead to the study of more abstract [[topological space]]s.

The most familiar metric space is [[3-dimensional Euclidean space]]. In fact, a "metric" is the generalization of the [[Euclidean metric]] arising from the four long-known properties of the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean metric  defines the distance between two points as the length of the [[Straight line|straight]] [[line segment]] connecting them. Other metric spaces occur for example in [[elliptic geometry]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]], where distance on a [[sphere]] measured by angle is a metric, and the [[hyperboloid model]] of hyperbolic geometry is used by [[special relativity]] as a metric space of [[velocities]].

== History ==
{{Expand section|Reasons for generalizing the Euclidean metric, first non-Euclidean metrics studied, consequences for mathematics|date=August 2011}}

In 1906 [[Maurice Fréchet]] introduced metric spaces in his work ''Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel''.&lt;ref&gt;Rendic. Circ. Mat. Palermo 22 (1906) 1–74&lt;/ref&gt; However the name is due to [[Felix Hausdorff]].

== Definition ==

A '''metric space''' is an [[ordered pair]] &lt;math&gt;(M,d)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]

:&lt;math&gt;d \colon M \times M \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

such that for any &lt;math&gt;x, y, z \in M&lt;/math&gt;, the following holds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=B. Choudhary|title=The Elements of Complex Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5K9i2YwgTjYC&amp;pg=PA20|year=1992|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-81-224-0399-2|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- same table is at [[Metric (mathematics)#Definition]] --&gt;
:{|
|-
|style="width:20px"| 1.
|style="width:250px"|&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt; 
|| [[Non-negative|non-negativity]] or separation axiom
|-
| 2. || &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = y&lt;/math&gt; || [[identity of indiscernibles]]
|-
| 3. || &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)  = d(y,x) &lt;/math&gt; || [[Symmetric function|symmetry]]
|-
| 4. || &lt;math&gt;d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y, z)&lt;/math&gt;  || [[subadditivity]] or [[triangle inequality]]
|}

The first condition follows from the other three. Since for any &lt;math&gt;x, y \in M&lt;/math&gt;:

:{|
|-
|style="width:250px"| &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) + d(y,x) \ge d(x,x)&lt;/math&gt;
|| by triangle inequality
|-
| &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) + d(x,y) \ge d(x,x)&lt;/math&gt;
| by symmetry
|-
| &lt;math&gt;2d(x,y) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
| by identity of indiscernibles
|-
| &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
| we have non-negativity
|-
|}

The function &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is also called ''distance function'' or simply ''distance''. Often, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is omitted and one just writes &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; for a metric space if it is clear from the context what metric is used.

Ignoring mathematical details, for any system of roads and terrains the distance between two locations can be defined as the length of the shortest route connecting those locations. To be a metric there shouldn't be any one-way roads. The triangle inequality expresses the fact that detours aren't shortcuts. If the distance between two points is zero, the two points are indistinguishable from one-another. Many of the examples below can be seen as concrete versions of this general idea.

== Examples of metric spaces == &lt;!-- [[Finite Metric space]] redirects here--&gt;
* The [[real number]]s with the distance function &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \vert y - x \vert&lt;/math&gt; given by the [[absolute difference]], and, more generally, [[Euclidean space|Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space]] with the [[Euclidean distance]], are [[complete space|complete]] metric spaces. The [[rational number]]s with the same distance function also form a metric space, but not a complete one.
* The [[positive real numbers]] with distance function &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) =\vert \log(y/x) \vert&lt;/math&gt; is a complete metric space.
* Any [[normed vector space]] is a metric space by defining &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \lVert y - x \rVert&lt;/math&gt;, see also [[Metric (mathematics)#Metrics on vector spaces|metrics on vector spaces]]. (If such a space is [[Complete metric space|complete]], we call it a [[Banach space]].) Examples:
** The [[Norm (mathematics)#Taxicab norm or Manhattan norm|Manhattan norm]] gives rise to the [[Manhattan distance]], where the distance between any two points, or vectors, is the sum of the differences between corresponding coordinates.
** The [[maximum norm]] gives rise to the [[Chebyshev distance]] or chessboard distance, the minimal number of moves a [[king (chess)|chess king]] would take to travel from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[British Rail]] metric (also called the “post office metric” or the “[[SNCF]] metric”) on a [[normed vector space]] is given by &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \lVert x \rVert + \lVert y \rVert&lt;/math&gt; for distinct points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;d(x,x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. More generally &lt;math&gt;\lVert . \rVert&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced with a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; taking an arbitrary set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to non-negative reals and taking the value &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; at most once:  then the metric is defined on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = f(x) + f(y)&lt;/math&gt; for distinct points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;d(x,x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  The name alludes to the tendency of railway journeys to proceed via London (or Paris) irrespective of their final destination.
* If &lt;math&gt;(M,d)&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[subset]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; becomes a metric space by restricting the domain of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X \times X&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[discrete metric]], where &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = 1&lt;/math&gt; otherwise, is a simple but important example, and can be applied to all sets. This, in particular, shows that for any set, there is always a metric space associated to it. Using this metric, any point is an [[open ball]], and therefore every subset is open and the space has the [[discrete topology]].
* A finite metric space is a metric space having a [[finite set|finite]] number of points.  Not every finite metric space can be [[Isometry|isometrically]] embedded in a [[Euclidean space]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nati Linial|Nathan Linial]]. [https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0304466 ''Finite Metric Spaces—Combinatorics, Geometry and Algorithms'', Proceedings of the ICM, Beijing 2002, vol. 3, pp573–586] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502190916/https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0304466 |date=2018-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~matousek/metrop.ps''Open problems  on embeddings  of finite  metric  spaces'', edited by Jirīı Matoušek, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226232112/http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~matousek/metrop.ps |date=2010-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[hyperbolic geometry#Models of the hyperbolic plane|hyperbolic plane]] is a metric space. More generally:
** If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is any [[connectedness|connected]] [[Riemannian manifold]], then we can turn &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; into a metric space by defining the distance of two points as the [[infimum]] of the lengths of the paths (continuously differentiable [[curve]]s) connecting them.
** If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is some set and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space, then, the set of all [[bounded function]]s &lt;math&gt;f \colon X \rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. those functions whose image is a [[bounded subset]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;) can be turned into a metric space by defining &lt;math&gt;d(f,g) = \sup_{x \in X} d(f(x),g(x))&lt;/math&gt; for any two bounded functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\sup&lt;/math&gt; is [[supremum]]).&lt;ref&gt;Searcóid, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aP37I4QWFRcC&amp;pg=PA107 p. 107].&lt;/ref&gt; This metric is called the [[uniform metric]] or supremum metric, and If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is complete, then this [[function space]] is complete as well. If ''X'' is also a topological space, then the set of all bounded [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] functions from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (endowed with the uniform metric), will also be a complete metric if ''M'' is.
** If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is an [[graph theory|undirected connected graph]], then the set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of vertices of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; can be turned into a metric space by defining &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; to be the length of the shortest path connecting the vertices &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. In [[geometric group theory]] this is applied to the [[Cayley graph]] of a group, yielding the [[word metric]].
* [[Graph edit distance]] is a measure of dissimilarity between two [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]], defined as the minimal number of [[Graph operations|graph edit operations]] required to transform one graph into another.
* The [[Levenshtein distance]] is a measure of the dissimilarity between two [[string (computer science)|strings]] &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, defined as the minimal number of character deletions, insertions, or substitutions required to transform &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. This can be thought of as a special case of the shortest path metric in a graph and is one example of an [[edit distance]].
* Given a metric space &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; and an increasing [[concave function]] &lt;math&gt;f \colon [0,\infty) \rightarrow [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f \circ d&lt;/math&gt; is also a metric on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
* Given an [[injective function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; from any set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to a metric space &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d(f(x), f(y))&lt;/math&gt; defines a metric on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
* Using [[T-theory]], the [[tight span]] of a metric space is also a metric space. The tight span is useful in several types of analysis.
* The set of all &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over some [[field (mathematics)|field]] is a metric space with respect to the [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] distance &lt;math&gt;d(X,Y) = \mathrm{rank}(Y - X)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[Helly metric]]  is used in [[game theory]].

== Open and closed sets, topology and convergence ==
Every metric space is a [[topological space]] in a natural manner, and therefore all definitions and theorems about general topological spaces also apply to all metric spaces.

About any point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in a metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; we define the '''[[open ball]] of radius &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a real number) about &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''' as the set
:&lt;math&gt;B(x;r) = \{y \in M : d(x,y) &lt; r\}.&lt;/math&gt;
These open balls form the [[base (topology)|base]] for a topology on ''M'', making it a [[topological space]].

Explicitly, a subset &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is called '''[[open set|open]]''' if for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; there exists an &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B(x;r)&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. The [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of an open set is called '''[[closed set|closed]]'''. A [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is any subset of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; that contains an open ball about &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as a subset.

A topological space which can arise in this way from a metric space is called a '''metrizable''' space; see the article on [[metrization theorems]] for further details.

A [[sequence]] (&lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;) in a metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is said to [[limit of a sequence|converge]] to the limit &lt;math&gt;x \in M&lt;/math&gt; [[iff]] for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a natural number ''N'' such that &lt;math&gt;d(x_n,x) &lt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, one can use the general definition of convergence available in all topological spaces.

A subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of the metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is closed iff every sequence in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that converges to a limit in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; has its limit in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

== Types of metric spaces ==

===Complete spaces===
{{Main|Complete metric space}}

A metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''complete''' if every [[Cauchy sequence]] converges in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. That is to say: if &lt;math&gt;d(x_n, x_m) \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as both &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; independently go to infinity, then there is some &lt;math&gt;y\in M&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d(x_n, y) \to 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Every [[Euclidean space]] is complete, as is every closed subset of a complete space. The rational numbers, using the absolute value metric &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \vert x - y \vert&lt;/math&gt;, are not complete.

Every metric space has a unique (up to [[isometry]]) [[completion (metric space)|completion]], which is a complete space that contains the given space as a [[dense set|dense]] subset. For example, the real numbers are the completion of the rationals.

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a complete subset of the metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is closed in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, a space is complete [[iff]] it is closed in any containing metric space.

Every complete metric space is a [[Baire space]].

===Bounded and totally bounded spaces===
[[File:Diameter of a Set.svg|thumb|Diameter of a set.]]
{{See also|bounded set}}
A metric space ''M'' is called '''bounded''' if there exists some number ''r'', such that ''d''(''x'',''y'') ≤ ''r'' for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''M''.  The smallest possible such ''r'' is called the '''[[diameter]]''' of ''M''. The space ''M'' is called '''precompact''' or '''[[totally bounded]]''' if for every ''r'' &gt; 0 there exist finitely many open balls of radius ''r'' whose union covers ''M''. Since the set of the centres of these balls is finite, it has finite diameter, from which it follows (using the triangle inequality) that every totally bounded space is bounded.  The converse does not hold, since any infinite set can be given the discrete metric (one of the examples above) under which it is bounded and yet not totally bounded.

Note that in the context of [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]]s in the space of [[real number]]s and occasionally regions in a Euclidean space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R ^n&lt;/math&gt; a bounded set is referred to as "a finite interval" or "finite region". However boundedness should not in general be confused with "finite", which refers to the number of elements, not to how far the set extends; finiteness implies boundedness, but not conversely. Also note that an unbounded subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R ^n&lt;/math&gt; may have a finite [[Lebesgue measure|volume]].

===Compact spaces===
A metric space ''M'' is compact if every sequence in ''M'' has a [[subsequence]] that converges to a point in ''M''. This is known as [[sequentially compact space|sequential compactness]] and, in metric spaces (but not in general topological spaces), is equivalent to the topological notions of [[countably compact space|countable compactness]] and [[compact space|compactness]] defined via [[open cover]]s.

Examples of compact metric spaces include the closed interval [0,1] with the absolute value metric, all metric spaces with finitely many points, and the [[Cantor set]]. Every closed subset of a compact space is itself compact.

A metric space is compact [[iff]] it is complete and totally bounded.  This is known as the [[Heine–Borel theorem]]. Note that compactness depends only on the topology, while boundedness depends on the metric.

[[Lebesgue's number lemma]] states that for every open cover of a compact metric space ''M'', there exists a "Lebesgue number" δ such that every subset of ''M'' of [[diameter]] &lt; δ is contained in some member of the cover.

Every compact metric space is [[second countable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/CompactMetricSpacesAreSecondCountable.html|title=PlanetMath: a compact metric space is second countable&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=planetmath.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205003114/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/CompactMetricSpacesAreSecondCountable.html|archivedate=5 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a continuous image of the [[Cantor set]]. (The latter result is due to [[Pavel Alexandrov]] and [[Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn|Urysohn]].)

===Locally compact and proper spaces===
A metric space is said to be [[locally compact]] if every point has a compact neighborhood. Euclidean spaces are locally compact, but infinite-dimensional Banach spaces are not.

A space is [[proper space|proper]] if every closed ball {''y'' : ''d''(''x'',''y'') ≤ ''r''} is compact. Proper spaces are locally compact, but the converse is not true in general.

===Connectedness===
A metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is [[connected space|connected]] if the only subsets that are both open and closed are the empty set and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; itself.

A metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is [[connectedness|path connected]] if for any two points &lt;math&gt;x, y \in M&lt;/math&gt; there exists a continuous map &lt;math&gt;f\colon [0,1] \to M&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f(0)=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(1)=y&lt;/math&gt;.
Every path connected space is connected, but the converse is not true in general.

There are also local versions of these definitions: [[locally connected space]]s and [[connectedness|locally path connected spaces]].

[[Simply connected space]]s are those that, in a certain sense, do not have "holes".

===Separable spaces===
A metric space is [[separable space]] if it has a [[countable]] [[dense set|dense]] subset. Typical examples are the real numbers or any Euclidean space. For metric spaces (but not for general topological spaces) separability is equivalent to [[second-countable space|second-countability]] and also to the [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]] property.

===Pointed metric spaces===
If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a nonempty metric space and &lt;math&gt;x_0\in X&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;(X,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''pointed metric space'', and &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''distinguished point''.  Note that a pointed metric space is just a nonempty metric space with attention drawn to its distinguished point, and that any nonempty metric space can be viewed as a pointed metric space. The distinguished point is sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; due to its similar behavior to zero in certain contexts.

==Types of maps between metric spaces==
Suppose (''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are two metric spaces.

===Continuous maps===
{{Main|Continuous function (topology)}}

The map ''f'':''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;→''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[continuous map|continuous]]
if it has one (and therefore all) of the following equivalent properties:
;General topological continuity: for every open set ''U'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[preimage]] ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;-1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') is open in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
:This is the general definition of [[Continuity (topology)|continuity in topology]].
;Sequential continuity: if (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a sequence in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that converges to ''x'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then the sequence (''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) converges to ''f''(''x'') in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
:This is [[sequential continuity]], due to [[Eduard Heine]].
;ε-δ definition: for every ''x'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and every ε&gt;0 there exists δ&gt;0 such that for all ''y'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; we have
::&lt;math&gt;d_1(x,y)&lt;\delta \Rightarrow d_2(f(x),f(y))&lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
:This uses the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]], and is due to [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]].

Moreover, ''f'' is continuous if and only if it is continuous on every compact subset of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

The [[image (mathematics)|image]] of every compact set under a continuous function is compact, and the image of every connected set under a continuous function is connected.

===Uniformly continuous maps===
The map ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;: ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]] if for every ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0 there exists ''δ''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;d_1(x,y)&lt;\delta \Rightarrow d_2(f(x),f(y))&lt; \varepsilon \quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Every uniformly continuous map ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;: ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is continuous.  The converse is true if ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is compact ([[Heine–Cantor theorem]]).

Uniformly continuous maps turn Cauchy sequences in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; into Cauchy sequences in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For continuous maps this is generally wrong; for example, a continuous map
from the open interval (0,1) ''onto'' the real line turns some Cauchy sequences into unbounded sequences.

===Lipschitz-continuous maps and contractions===
{{Main|Lipschitz continuity}}

Given a real number ''K''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0, the map ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;: ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Lipschitz continuity|''K''-Lipschitz continuous]] if

:&lt;math&gt;d_2(f(x),f(y))\leq K d_1(x,y)\quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Every Lipschitz-continuous map is uniformly continuous, but the converse is not true in general.

If ''K'' &lt; 1, then ''ƒ'' is called a [[contraction mapping|contraction]]. Suppose ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is complete. If ''ƒ'' is a contraction, then ''ƒ'' admits a unique fixed point ([[Banach fixed point theorem]]). If ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is compact, the condition can be weakened a bit: ''ƒ'' admits a unique fixed point if

:&lt;math&gt; d(f(x), f(y)) &lt; d(x, y) \quad \mbox{for all} \quad x \ne y \in M_1&lt;/math&gt;.

===Isometries===
The map ''f'':''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;→''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[isometry]] if
:&lt;math&gt;d_2(f(x),f(y))=d_1(x,y)\quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1&lt;/math&gt;
Isometries are always [[injective]]; the image of a compact or complete set under an isometry is compact or complete, respectively. However, if the isometry is not [[surjective]], then the image of a closed (or open) set need not be closed (or open).

===Quasi-isometries===
The map ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[quasi-isometry]] if there exist constants ''A''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 and ''B''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{A} d_2(f(x),f(y))-B\leq d_1(x,y)\leq A d_2(f(x),f(y))+B \text{ for all } x,y\in M_1&lt;/math&gt;

and a constant ''C''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 such that every point in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a distance at most ''C'' from some point in the image&amp;nbsp;''f''(''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).

Note that a quasi-isometry is not required to be continuous. Quasi-isometries compare the "large-scale structure" of metric spaces; they find use in [[geometric group theory]] in relation to the [[word metric]].

==Notions of metric space equivalence==
Given two metric spaces (''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):

*They are called '''homeomorphic''' (topologically isomorphic) if there exists a [[homeomorphism]] between them (i.e., a [[bijection]] continuous in both directions).
*They are called '''uniformic''' (uniformly isomorphic) if there exists a [[uniform isomorphism]] between them (i.e., a [[bijection]] uniformly continuous in both directions).
*They are called '''isometric''' if there exists a [[bijective]] [[isometry]] between them. In this case, the two metric spaces are essentially identical.
*They are called '''quasi-isometric''' if there exists a [[quasi-isometry]] between them.

==Topological properties==
Metric spaces are [[paracompact]]&lt;ref&gt;Rudin, Mary Ellen.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2035708 A new proof that metric spaces are paracompact] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412015215/http://www.jstor.org/stable/2035708 |date=2016-04-12 }}.  Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 20, No. 2. (Feb., 1969), p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hausdorff space]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{planetmath reference|id=5838|title=metric spaces are Hausdorff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence [[normal space|normal]] (indeed they are perfectly normal). An important consequence is that every metric space admits [[partitions of unity]] and that every continuous real-valued function defined on a closed subset of a metric space can be extended to a continuous map on the whole space ([[Tietze extension theorem]]). It is also true that every real-valued [[Lipschitz maps|Lipschitz-continuous]] map defined on a subset of a metric space can be extended to a Lipschitz-continuous map on the whole space.

Metric spaces are [[first countable]] since one can use balls with rational radius as a neighborhood base.

The metric topology on a metric space ''M'' is the coarsest topology on ''M'' relative to which the metric ''d'' is a continuous map from the product of ''M'' with itself to the non-negative real numbers.

==Distance between points and sets; Hausdorff distance and Gromov metric==
A simple way to construct a function separating a point from a closed set (as required for a [[completely regular]] space) is to consider the [[Distance#Distances between sets and between a point and a set|distance between the point and the set]]. If (''M'',''d'') is a metric space, ''S'' is a [[subset]] of ''M'' and ''x'' is a point of ''M'', we define the distance from ''x'' to ''S'' as
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,S) = \inf\{d(x,s) : s \in S \} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\inf&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[infimum]].

Then ''d''(''x'', ''S'') = 0 if and only if ''x'' belongs to the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''S''. Furthermore, we have the following generalization of the triangle inequality:
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,S) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,S),&lt;/math&gt;
which in particular shows that the map &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto d(x,S)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

Given two subsets ''S'' and ''T'' of ''M'', we define their [[Hausdorff distance]] to be
:&lt;math&gt;d_H(S,T) = \max \{ \sup\{d(s,T) : s \in S \} , \sup\{ d(t,S) : t \in T \} \} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sup&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[supremum]].

In general, the Hausdorff distance ''d''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'',''T'') can be infinite. Two sets are close to each other in the Hausdorff distance if every element of either set is close to some element of the other set.

The Hausdorff distance ''d''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; turns the set ''K''(''M'') of all non-empty compact subsets of ''M'' into a metric space. One can show that ''K''(''M'') is complete if ''M'' is complete.
(A different notion of convergence of compact subsets is given by the [[Kuratowski convergence]].)

One can then define the [[Gromov–Hausdorff convergence|Gromov–Hausdorff distance]] between any two metric spaces by considering the minimal Hausdorff distance of isometrically embedded versions of the two spaces. Using this distance, the class of all (isometry classes of) compact metric spaces becomes a metric space in its own right.

==Product metric spaces==
If &lt;math&gt;(M_1,d_1),\ldots,(M_n,d_n)&lt;/math&gt; are metric spaces, and ''N'' is the [[Euclidean norm]] on ''R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', then &lt;math&gt;\Big(M_1\times \ldots \times M_n, N(d_1,\ldots,d_n)\Big)&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space, where the [[product metric]] is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;N(d_1,...,d_n)\Big((x_1,\ldots,x_n),(y_1,\ldots,y_n)\Big) = N\Big(d_1(x_1,y_1),\ldots,d_n(x_n,y_n)\Big),&lt;/math&gt;

and the induced topology agrees with the [[product topology]].  By the equivalence of norms in finite dimensions, an equivalent metric is obtained if ''N'' is the [[Norm (mathematics)#Taxicab norm or Manhattan norm|taxicab norm]], a [[Norm (mathematics)#p-norm|p-norm]], the [[Norm (mathematics)#Infinity norm or maximum norm|max norm]], or any other norm which is non-decreasing as the coordinates of a positive ''n''-tuple increase (yielding the triangle inequality).

Similarly, a countable product of metric spaces can be obtained using the following metric

:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac1{2^i}\frac{d_i(x_i,y_i)}{1+d_i(x_i,y_i)}.&lt;/math&gt;

An uncountable product of metric spaces need not be metrizable. For example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is not [[first-countable space|first-countable]] and thus isn't metrizable.

===Continuity of distance===
In the case of a single space &lt;math&gt;(M,d)&lt;/math&gt;, the distance map &lt;math&gt;d\colon M\times M \rightarrow R^+&lt;/math&gt; (from the [[Metric space#Definition|definition]]) is uniformly continuous with respect to any of the above product metrics &lt;math&gt;N(d,d)&lt;/math&gt;, and in particular is continuous with respect to the product topology of &lt;math&gt;M\times M&lt;/math&gt;.

==Quotient metric spaces==
If ''M'' is a metric space with metric ''d'', and ''~'' is an [[equivalence relation]] on ''M'', then we can endow the quotient set ''M/~'' with the following (pseudo)metric. Given two equivalence classes [''x''] and [''y''], we define
:&lt;math&gt;d'([x],[y]) = \inf\{d(p_1,q_1)+d(p_2,q_2)+\dotsb+d(p_{n},q_{n})\}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[infimum]] is taken over all finite sequences &lt;math&gt;(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;[p_1]=[x]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;[q_n]=[y]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;[q_i]=[p_{i+1}], i=1,2,\dots, n-1&lt;/math&gt;. In general this will only define a [[pseudometric space|pseudometric]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;d'([x],[y])=0&lt;/math&gt; does not necessarily imply that &lt;math&gt;[x]=[y]&lt;/math&gt;. However, for nice equivalence relations (e.g., those given by gluing together polyhedra along faces), it is a metric.

The quotient metric ''d'' is characterized by the following [[universal property]]. If &lt;math&gt;f:(M,d)\longrightarrow(X,\delta)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric map]] between metric spaces (that is, &lt;math&gt;\delta(f(x),f(y))\le d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'', ''y'') satisfying ''f''(''x'')=''f''(''y'') whenever &lt;math&gt;x\sim y,&lt;/math&gt; then the induced function &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}\colon M/\sim\longrightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, given by &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}([x])=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, is a metric map &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}\colon (M/\sim,d')\longrightarrow (X,\delta).&lt;/math&gt;

A topological space is [[sequential space|sequential]] if and only if it is a quotient of a metric space.&lt;ref&gt;Goreham, Anthony. [http://at.yorku.ca/p/a/a/o/51.pdf Sequential convergence in Topological Spaces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604232111/http://at.yorku.ca/p/a/a/o/51.pdf |date=2011-06-04 }}. Honours' Dissertation, Queen's College, Oxford (April, 2001), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations of metric spaces==
*Every metric space is a [[uniform space]] in a natural manner, and every uniform space is naturally a [[topological space]]. Uniform and topological spaces can therefore be regarded as generalizations of metric spaces.
*If we consider the first definition of a metric space [[#Definition|given above]] and relax the second requirement, we arrive at the concepts of a [[pseudometric space]] or a dislocated metric space.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Pascal Hitzler and Anthony Seda, Mathematical Aspects of Logic Programming Semantics. Chapman and Hall/CRC, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; If we remove the third or fourth, we arrive at a [[quasimetric space]], or a [[semimetric space]].
*If the distance function takes values in the [[extended real number line]] '''R'''∪{+∞}, but otherwise satisfies all four conditions, then it is called an ''extended metric'' and the corresponding space is called an ''&lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;-metric space''. If the distance function takes values in some (suitable) ordered set (and the triangle inequality is adjusted accordingly), then we arrive at the notion of ''generalized ultrametric''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*[[Approach space]]s are a generalization of metric spaces, based on point-to-set distances, instead of point-to-point distances.
*A [[continuity space]] is a generalization of metric spaces and [[poset]]s, that can be used to unify the notions of metric spaces and [[Domain theory|domain]]s.
* A partial metric space is intended to be the least generalisation of the notion of a metric space, such that the distance of each point from itself is no longer necessarily zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/pmetric/|title=Partial metrics : welcome|author=|date=|website=www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727003912/http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/pmetric/|archivedate=27 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metric spaces as enriched categories ===
The ordered set &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R},\geq)&lt;/math&gt; can be seen as a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] by requesting exactly one [[morphism]] &lt;math&gt;a\to b&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;a\geq b&lt;/math&gt; and none otherwise. By using &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; as the [[tensor product]] and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; as the [[Identity element|identity]], it becomes a [[monoidal category]] &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt;.
Every metric space &lt;math&gt;(M,d)&lt;/math&gt; can now be viewed as a category &lt;math&gt;M^*&lt;/math&gt; [[enriched category|enriched]] over &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt;:
* Set &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ob}(M^*):=M&lt;/math&gt;
* For each &lt;math&gt;X,Y\in M&lt;/math&gt; set &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(X,Y):=d(X,Y)\in \operatorname{Ob}(R^*)&lt;/math&gt;
* The composition morphism &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(Y,Z)\otimes \operatorname{Hom}(X,Y)\to \operatorname{Hom}(X,Z)&lt;/math&gt; will be the unique morphism in &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt; given from the triangle inequality &lt;math&gt;d(y,z)+d(x,y)\geq d(x,z)&lt;/math&gt;
* The identity morphism &lt;math&gt;0\to \operatorname{Hom}(X,X)&lt;/math&gt; will be the unique morphism given from the fact that &lt;math&gt;0\geq d(X,X)&lt;/math&gt;.
* Since &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt; is a poset, all [[Diagram (category theory)|diagrams]] that are required for an enriched category commute automatically.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1938">The [[National Motor Freight Traffic Association]] publishes the '''National Motor Freight Classification®''' (NMFC®), a standard that provides a comparison of commodities moving in commerce. The NMFC® is developed and maintained by the [[Commodity Classification Standards Board]] (CCSB).  

The NMFC® is a voluntary standard that provides a comparison of commodities moving in interstate, intrastate and foreign commerce. It is similar in concept to the groupings or grading systems that serve many other industries. Commodities are grouped into one of 18 classes—from a low of class 50 to a high of class 500—based on an evaluation of four transportation characteristics: density, stowability, handling and liability. Together, these characteristics establish a commodity’s “transportability.”&lt;ref name="nmfta"&gt;{{cite web|title="The National Motor Freight Classification"|url=http://www.nmfta.org/pages/nmfc|publisher=NMFTA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NMFC® also specifies minimum packaging requirements to ensure that goods are adequately protected in the motor carrier environment and can be handled and stowed in a manner that is reasonably safe and practicable. It contains various rules that govern and otherwise relate to the classification and/or packaging of commodities as well as procedures for the filing and disposition of claims, and procedures governing interline settlements. It also contains the [[Bill of lading|Uniform Straight Bill of Lading]], including its terms and conditions.&lt;ref name="nmfta"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negative utilitarianism''' is a version of the ethical theory [[utilitarianism]] that gives greater priority to reducing [[suffering]] (negative utility or 'disutility') than to increasing [[pleasure|happiness]] (positive utility).&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Leslie|1998|page=12}}: "'Negative utilitarianism' is concerned mainly or entirely with reducing evils rather than with maximizing goods." The example unpleasant experiences is an example based on a hedonistic theory of well-being, according to which pleasant experiences are good for individuals and unpleasant experiences are bad for individuals. But there are other theories of well-being and negative utilitarianism need not adopt a hedonistic theory.&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from classical utilitarianism, which does not claim that reducing suffering is intrinsically more important than increasing happiness. Both versions of utilitarianism hold that morally right and morally wrong actions depend solely on the consequences for overall [[well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=19}}: "The whole family of utilitarian theories is captured by the equation: Utilitarianism = Consequentialism (nothing but the values of outcomes matter for the rightness of actions) + Welfarism (nothing but well-being matters for the value of outcomes)."&lt;/ref&gt; 'Well-being' refers to the state of the individual.{{sfn|Bykvist|2009|loc=chpt. 4}} The term 'negative utilitarianism' is used by some authors to denote the theory that reducing negative well-being is the ''only'' thing that ultimately matters morally.{{sfn|Smart|1958}} Others distinguish between 'strong' and 'weak' versions of negative utilitarianism, where strong versions are ''only'' concerned with reducing negative well-being, and weak versions say that ''both'' positive and negative well-being matter but that negative well-being matters more.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=29}} says that strong versions of negative utilitarianism "give all weight to disutility" and weak versions "give some weight to positive utility, but more weight to disutility." {{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}: “Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family.” {{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: “NU [negative utilitarianism] comes in several flavours, which I will outline later, but the basic thrust is that an act is morally right if and only if it leads to less suffering than any available alternative. Unlike Classical Utilitarianism, positive experiences such as pleasure or happiness are either given no weight, or at least a lot less weight.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions of negative utilitarianism differ in how much weight they give to negative well-being ('disutility') compared to positive well-being (positive utility), as well as the different conceptions of what well-being (utility) is. For example, negative [[preference utilitarianism]] says that the well-being in an outcome depends on [[antifrustrationism|frustrated preferences]]. Negative [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] utilitarianism thinks of well-being in terms of pleasant and unpleasant experiences.{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}} There are many other variations on how negative utilitarianism can be specified.

The term "negative utilitarianism" was introduced by [[Ninian Smart|R. Ninian Smart]] in 1958 in his reply to [[Karl Popper]]'s ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]''. Smart also presented the most famous argument against negative utilitarianism:{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=31}} that negative utilitarianism would entail that a ruler who is able to instantly and painlessly destroy the human race would have a duty to do so. Furthermore, every human being would have a moral responsibility to commit suicide, thereby preventing future suffering.  {{sfn|Smart|1958|p=542}} Many authors have endorsed versions of this argument, and some have presented counterarguments against it.

== History ==
The term ‘negative utilitarianism’ was introduced by [[Ninian Smart|R. N. Smart]] in his 1958 reply to [[Karl Popper]]'s book ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', published in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smart|1958|p=542}}: "Professor Popper has proposed a negative formulation of the utilitarian principle, so that we should replace ‘Aim at the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number’ by ‘The least amount of avoidable suffering for all’. He says: ‘It adds to the clarity of ethics if we formulate our demands negatively, i.e. if we demand the elimination of suffering rather than the promotion of happiness’. However, one may reply to negative utilitarianism..."&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Popper emphasizes the importance of preventing suffering in public policy.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Popper wrote, "I suggest, for this reason, to replace the utilitarian formula ‘Aim at the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number’, or briefly, ‘Maximize happiness’ by the formula ‘The least amount of avoidable suffering for all’, or briefly, ‘Minimize suffering’. {{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415610216|page=548}} Popper claimed that "there is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure... In my opinion human suffering makes a direct moral appeal, namely, the appeal for help, while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway. A further criticism of the Utilitarian formula "Maximize pleasure" is that it assumes a continuous pleasure-pain scale which allows us to treat degrees of pain as negative degrees of pleasure. But, from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure, and especially not one man's pain by another man's pleasure. Instead of the greatest happiness for the greatest number, one should demand, more modestly, the least amount of avoidable suffering for all..." {{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies: Volume 1: The Spell of Plato|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415237314|pages=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas in negative utilitarianism have similarities with ancient traditions such as [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Contestabile|2014|page=298}}: "Negative utilitarianism and Buddhism share the following intuitions: Negative utilitarianism—understood as an umbrella term—models the asymmetry between suffering and happiness and therefore accords with the Buddhist intuition of universal compassion. The Noble Truths of Buddhism accord with the negative utilitarian intuition that (global) suffering cannot be compensated by happiness. Some forms of Buddhism and negative utilitarianism share the intuition that non-existence is a perfect state." {{harvnb|Goodman|2009|page=101}}: “Negative utilitarianism shares with Buddhism a strong focus on alleviating the suffering of beings.”&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene]] has been said to be “one of the earliest exponents of NU [Negative Utilitarianism].”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keown|1992|page=175}}: “one of the earliest exponents of NU, Hegesias...”&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times, ideas similar to negative utilitarianism can be found in the works of 19th century psychologist [[Edmund Gurney]] who wrote:

{{quote|Enough suffering will always remain to make the question of the desirability . . . of their sojourn on earth a question which numbers will answer . . . in the negative. . . . When we forget pain, or underestimate it, or talk about people 'getting used to it', we are really so far losing sight of what the universe, which we wish to conceive adequately, really is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utilitarianism.com/gurney/index.html|title=Edmund Gurney (1847 - 88)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Versions of negative utilitarianism ==
Like other kinds of [[utilitarianism]], negative utilitarianism can take many forms depending on what specific claims are taken to constitute the theory. For example, negative [[preference utilitarianism]] says that the utility of an outcome depends on frustrated and satisfied preferences. Negative [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] utilitarianism thinks of utility in terms of hedonic mental states such as suffering and unpleasantness.{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}} Versions of (negative) utilitarianism can also differ based on whether the ''actual'' or ''expected'' consequences matter, and whether the aim is stated in terms of the ''average'' outcome among individuals or the ''total'' net utility (or lack of disutility) among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sinnott-Armstrong|2014}} provides a nice overview of the many ways in which consequentialism can be varied. Since utilitarianism (and negative utilitarianism) is a kind of consequentialism, much of it applies to utilitarianism and negative utilitarianism as well. Section 1. "Classic Utilitarianism" shows the many distinct and variable claims that make up Classic Utilitarianism.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative utilitarianism can aim either to ''optimize'' the value of the outcome or it can be a ''satisficing'' negative utilitarianism, according to which an action ought to be taken if and only if the outcome would be ''sufficiently'' valuable (or have sufficiently low disvalue).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=102}}, states satisficing utilitarianism as follows: "''Satisficing utilitarianism'' An action ought to be done if and only if it would bring about a sufficient level of total well-being."&lt;/ref&gt; A key way in which negative utilitarianisms can differ from one another is with respect to how much weight they give to negative well-being (disutility) compared to positive well-being (positive utility). This is a key area of variation because the key difference between negative utilitarianism and non-negative kinds of utilitarianism is that negative utilitarianism gives more weight to negative well-being.

=== The weight of evil (disutility) ===
Philosophers Gustaf Arrhenius and Krister Bykvist develop a taxonomy of negative utilitarian views based on how the views weigh disutility against positive utility.&lt;ref&gt;They write that they distinguish among kinds of 'negative utilitarianism': "Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family. The problem was then to find out which members of this family we want to join, and to spell out why we do not want to be as some of our siblings." {{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}. The taxonomy is phrased in terms of 'negativisms,' which appear to be the same as 'negativist' and 'negative' utilitarianisms: "we believe that disutility has greater weight than utility. The overall aim with this part of our essay is to give an account of this weight, which means that we shall try to formulate a welfarist act-consequentialism that takes seriously the weight of disutility. In other words, we are looking for an acceptable negativist utilitarianism." {{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In total, they distinguish among 16 kinds of negative utilitarianism.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|pp=30,38}} They first distinguish between ''strong negativism'' and ''weak negativism''. Strong negativism "give all weight to disutility" and weak negativism "give some weight to positive utility, but more weight to disutility."{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=29}} The most commonly discussed subtypes are probably two versions of weak negative utilitarianism called 'lexical' and 'lexical threshold' negative utilitarianism. According to 'lexical' negative utilitarianism, positive utility gets weight only when outcomes are equal with respect to disutility. That is, positive utility functions as a tiebreaker in that it determines which outcome is better (or less bad) when the outcomes considered have equal disutility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=39}}: "The claim that disutility has greater weight can now be expressed by letting the disutilities have greater lexical weight. But still the utility has some weight in the sense that if the disutilities are the same in the alternatives, and hence we cannot minimise the disutility any further, then we ought to maximise the utility. Depending on what kinds of disutilities we choose in establishing this order, we get different lexical negativisms."&lt;/ref&gt; 'Lexical threshold' negative utilitarianism says that there is some disutility, for instance some extreme suffering, such that no positive utility can counterbalance it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: "''Lexical Threshold NU''
Suffering and happiness both count, but there is some amount of suffering that no amount of happiness can outweigh."&lt;/ref&gt; 'Consent-based' negative utilitarianism is a specification of lexical threshold negative utilitarianism, which specifies where the threshold should be located. It says that if an individual is suffering and would at that moment not "agree to continue the suffering in order to obtain something else in the future" then the suffering cannot be outweighed by any happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Tomasik formulated and advocated consent-based negative utilitarianism. He writes, "would the person-moment suffering agree to continue the suffering in order to obtain something else in the future? If yes, then the suffering doesn't pass the threshold of unbearableness and thus can be outweighed by happiness." {{harvnb|Tomasik|2015}}. See section “Consent-based negative utilitarianism?” The ‘person-moment’ means the person in the moment of suffering, as opposed to before or after the suffering occurred.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other distinctions among versions of negative utilitarianism ===
[[Thomas Metzinger]] proposes the 'principle of negative utilitarianism,' which is the broad idea that suffering should be minimized when possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metzinger|2003|page=622}}: “In terms of a fundamental solidarity of all suffering beings against suffering, something that almost all of us should be able to agree on is what I will term the “principle of negative utilitarianism”: Whatever else our exact ethical commitments and specific positive goals are, we can and should certainly all agree that, in principle, and whenever possible, the overall amount of conscious suffering in all beings capable of conscious suffering should be minimized. I know that it is impossible to give any truly conclusive argument in favor of this principle. And, of course, there exist all kinds of theoretical complications—for example, individual rights, long-term preferences, and epistemic indeterminacy. But the underlying intuition is something that can be shared by almost everybody: We can all agree that no additional suffering should be created without need. Albert Camus once spoke about the solidarity of all finite beings against death, and in just the same sense there should be a solidarity of all sentient beings capable of suffering against suffering. Out of this solidarity we should not do anything that would increase the overall amount of suffering and confusion in the universe—let alone something that highly ''likely'' will have this effect right from the beginning.”&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mario Bunge]] writes about negative utilitarianism in his ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy'' but in a different sense than most others. In Bunge's sense, negative utilitarianism is about not harming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bunge|1989|p=230}}: "By recommending passivity it [negative utilitarianism] condones evil. The spectator who watches impassively a hooligan attacking an old woman, and the citizen who does not bother to vote, comply with negative utilitarianism and thereby tolerate evil."&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, most other discussion of negative utilitarianism takes it to imply a duty both not to harm and to help (at least in the sense of reducing negative well-being).&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{harvnb|Pearce|Negative Utilitarianism: Why Be Negative?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The benevolent world-exploder ==
In the 1958 article where [[Ninian Smart|R. N. Smart]] introduced the term ‘negative utilitarianism’ he argued against it, stating that negative utilitarianism would entail that a ruler who is able to instantly and painlessly destroy the human race, "a benevolent world-exploder," would have a duty to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smart|1958|page=542}}: "Suppose that a ruler controls a weapon capable of instantly and painlessly destroying the human race. Now it is empirically certain that there would be some suffering before all those alive on any proposed destruction day were to die in the natural course of events. Consequently the use of the weapon is bound to diminish suffering, and would be the ruler's duty on NU grounds." For his use of the term ‘the benevolent world-exploder’ see page 543.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the most famous argument against negative utilitarianism,{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=31}} and it is directed against sufficiently strong versions of negative utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;That is, the argument is directed against strong versions of negative utilitarainaism that prescribe only reducing negative well-being, as well as weak versions that are sufficiently close to strong negative utilitarianism. Such weak versions would be those that, although they give weight to both negative and positive well-being, give sufficiently much more the weight to negative well-being, so that they would have the same implications as strong versions in relevant situations.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors have endorsed this argument,&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Bunge|1989|p=230}}: "Negative utilitarianism ... is open to the following objections.... Fourthly, the most expeditious way of implementing the doctrine would be to exterminate humankind, for then human suffering would cease altogether (R. N. Smart 1958)." {{harvnb|Heyd|1992|p=60}}: "Negative utilitarianism, which seems promising in guiding us in genethics, also urges (at least in its impersonal version) paradoxical (and to some, morally abhorrent) solutions to the miseries of humanity. Primarily it recommends the painless annihilation of all humanity—either by the collective suicide of all actual beings, or by total abstention from procreation by one generation (Smart 1958, 542-543)." {{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: "R. N. Smart wrote a response [3] in which he christened the principle 'Negative Utilitarianism' and showed a major unattractive consequence. A thorough going Negative Utilitarian would support the destruction of the world (even by violent means) as the suffering involved would be small compared to the suffering in everyday life in the world."&lt;/ref&gt; and some have presented counterarguments against it. Below are replies to this argument that have been presented and discussed.

=== Cooperation between different value systems ===
One possible reply to this argument is that only a naive interpretation of negative utilitarianism would endorse world destruction. The conclusion can be mitigated by pointing out the importance of cooperation between different value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gains from Trade through Compromise – Foundational Research Institute|url = http://foundational-research.org/gains-from-trade-through-compromise/|website = foundational-research.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are good consequentialist reasons why one should be cooperative towards other value systems and it is particularly important to avoid doing something harmful to other value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reasons to Be Nice to Other Value Systems – Foundational Research Institute|url = http://foundational-research.org/reasons-to-be-nice-to-other-value-systems/|website = foundational-research.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of the world would strongly violate many other value systems and endorsing it would therefore be uncooperative. Since there are many ways to reduce suffering which do not infringe on other value systems, it makes sense for negative utilitarians to focus on these options. In an extended interpretation of negative utilitarianism, cooperation with other value systems is considered and the conclusion is that it is better to reduce suffering without violating other value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.utilitarianism.com/nu/nufaq.html|title = Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eliminating vs. reducing disutility ===
Another reply to the benevolent world-exploder argument is that it does not distinguish between eliminating and reducing negative well-being, and that negative utilitarianism should plausibly be formulated in terms of reducing and not eliminating.&lt;ref&gt;This is essentially [[H. B. Acton]]'s reply. {{harvnb|Acton|Watkins|1963|page=84}}: "Eliminating suffering is not the same thing as reducing it or as arriving at 'the least amount of avoidable suffering for all', and it is the latter, not the former, that might, with some plausibility, be regarded as a possible substitute for the more usual form of utilitarianism. Would not, then, the destroyer imagined by Smart be making a terrible mistake through failing to notice the difference between eliminating and reducing?"&lt;/ref&gt; A counterargument to that reply is that elimination is a form of reduction, similar to how zero is a number.&lt;ref&gt;This is [[J. J. C. Smart]]'s reply to Acton. J. J. C. Smart agrees with his brother R. N. Smart that "if we made the minimization of misery our sole ultimate ethical principle ... we should approve of a tyrannical but benevolent world exploder." {{harvnb|Smart|1973|page=29}} J. J. C. Smart replies to Acton that "surely eliminating is a case of reducing – the best case of all, the negative utilitarian would say. In suggesting that eliminating is not reducing, Acton seems to me to be like a person who says that zero is not a number." {{harvnb|Smart|1989||p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attempting world destruction would be counterproductive ===
Several philosophers have argued that to try to destroy the world (or to kill many people) would be counterproductive from a negative utilitarian perspective. One such argument is provided by [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]], who says that "planning and implementing the extinction of all sentient life couldn't be undertaken painlessly. Even contemplating such an enterprise would provoke distress. Thus a negative utilitarian is not compelled to argue for the apocalyptic solution."{{sfn|Pearce|2005}} Instead, Pearce advocates the use of biotechnology to phase out the biology of suffering throughout the living world, and he says that "life-long happiness can be genetically pre-programmed."{{sfn|Pearce|Negative Utilitarianism: Why Be Negative?}} A similar reply to the similar claim that negative utilitarianism would imply that we should kill off the miserable and needy is that we rarely face policy choices and that "anyway there are excellent utilitarian reasons for avoiding such a policy, since people would find out about it and become even more miserable and fearful."&lt;ref&gt;Clark Wolf proposes and defends ‘negative critical level utilitarianism’ in the context of social choice and population choices, which says that "population choices should be guided by an aim to minimize suffering and deprivation" {{harv|Wolf|1996|page=273}}. He brings up the possible objection to his principle that "it might occur to someone that the best way to minimize current suffering and deprivation would be to quietly, secretly, and painlessly kill off all of those who are miserable and needy" {{harv|Wolf|1996|page=278}}. A part of his reply is that "die hard utilitarians could argue that we rarely face such a policy choice, and that anyway there are excellent utilitarian reasons for avoiding such a policy, since people would find out about it and become even more miserable and fearful" {{harv|Wolf|1996|page=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ's answer to question "3.2 Should NUs try to increase extinction risk?" begins with "No, that would very bad even by NU standards."{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}}

=== Life could evolve again in a worse way ===
Some replies to the benevolent world exploder-argument take the form that even if the world were destroyed, that would or might be bad from a negative utilitarian perspective. One such reply provided by [[John W. N. Watkins]] is that even if life were destroyed, life could evolve again, perhaps in a worse way. So the world-exploder would need to destroy the possibility of life, but that is in principle beyond human power.&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. N. Watkins]] describes himself as "a sort of negative utilitarian" {{harv|Acton|Watkins|1963|page=95}}. He replies to R. N. Smart that "even if all life ''were'' destroyed, in due course living matter might emerge from the slime once more, and the evolutionary process start up again—this time accompanied, perhaps, by even more pain than would have accompanied the continued existence of the human race. So the pain minimiser would need to destroy the very ''possibility'' of life. And I like to think that this is something which is ''in principle'' beyond human power" {{harv|Acton|Watkins|1963|page=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To this, J. J. C. Smart replies,

{{quote|I am also a little puzzled by Watkin's remark that the pain minimizer would have to destroy the ''very possibility'' of life. If the sentient forms of life were totally destroyed, it might be that the sentient forms would be most unlikely to evolve. This is on the supposition, held by some experts, that the evolution of higher forms of life on earth depended on a lot of lucky accidents. If this is not the case, then the benevolent world destroyer should ensure that ''all'' forms of life are destroyed, even bacteria and plants and insects, but should this be impossible the world destroyer might have at least ensured a pain free globe for hundreds of millions of years to come. In any case my brother's example was of a world ''exploder'', and I think this would ensure the destruction of ''all'' life on earth. Of course there might be sentient life on planets of distant stars. No doubt the world exploder can do nothing about this, even with the resources of a future physics, but his or her negative utilitarian duty would not be to do the impossible, but would be to minimize suffering as much as lies within his or her power.{{sfn|Smart|1989||pp=44-45}}}}

=== Getting killed would be a great evil ===
Another related reply to the world-exploder argument is that getting killed would be a great evil. Erich Kadlec defends negative utilitarianism and replies to the benevolent world-exploder argument (in part) as follows: "He [R. N. Smart] also dispenses with the generally known fact that all people (with a few exceptions in extreme situations) like to live and would consider being killed not a benefit but as the greatest evil done to them."{{sfn|Kadlec|2008|110}}

=== Frustrated preferences ===
Negative [[preference utilitarianism]] has a preferentialist conception of well-being. That is, it is bad for an individual to get his aversions fulfilled (or preferences frustrated), and depending on version of negative utilitarianism, it may also be good for him to get his preferences satisfied. A negative utilitarian with such a conception of well-being, or whose conception of well-being includes such a preferentialist component, could reply to the benevolent world-exploder argument by saying that the explosion would be bad because it would fulfill many individuals' aversions.&lt;ref&gt;"A preferentialist could, for example, claim that most people now living prefer to live, and that these preferences must be counted when elimination is at stake. So, the elimination results in a lot of frustrated preferences, and we must balance the evil ofthis against the evil of the unhappiness in the future of humanity." {{harv|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrhenius and Bykvist provide two criticisms of this reply. First, it could be claimed that frustrated preferences require that someone exists who has the frustrated preference. But if everyone is dead there are no preferences and hence no badness.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=32}} Second, even if a world-explosion would involve frustrated preferences that would be bad from a negative preference utilitarian perspective, such a negative utilitarian should still favor it as the lesser of two evils compared to all the frustrated preferences that would likely exist if the world continued to exist.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=32}}

The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ suggests two replies to Arrhenius and Bykvist's first type of criticism (the criticism that if no one exists anymore then there are no frustrated preferences anymore): The first reply is that past preferences count, even if the individual who held them no longer exists.&lt;ref&gt;"NIPU [negative ideal preference utilitarianism] isn’t about minimizing the amount of unsatisfied preferences that currently exist, but rather about minimizing the total amount of unsatisfied preferences in the (space-time) universe. This includes past preferences." {{harv|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second is that "instead of counting past preferences, one could look at the matter in terms of life-goals. The earlier the death of a person who wants to go on living, the more unfulfilled her life-goal."{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}} The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ also replies to Arrhenius and Bykvist's second type of criticism. The reply is (in part) that the criticism relies on the empirical premise that there would be more frustrated preferences in the future if the world continued to exist than if the world was destroyed. But that negative preference utilitarianism would say that extinction would be better (in theory), assuming that premise, should not count substantially against the theory, because for any view on population ethics that assigns disvalue to something, one can imagine future scenarios such that extinction would be better according to the given view.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}}. See section "2.1.5 Back to destroying the world, doesn’t NIPU still imply that extinction would be best, because if there will be a lot of people in the future, their unsatisfied preferences combined are worse than the preferences being thwarted by extinction?"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combining negative utilitarianism with rights ===
A part of Clark Wolf's response to the benevolent world-exploder objection is that negative utilitarianism can be combined with a theory of rights. He says,

{{quote|A more direct way to address this problem would be to incorporate a theory of rights, stipulating that in general, policy makers simply have no right to make decisions about whether the lives of others are worth living, or whether they should live or die. Since it is clear that policy makers have no right to kill off the miserable and destitute, this response gains support from our moral intuitions.{{sfn|Wolf|1996|p=278}}}}

Negative utilitarianism can be combined, in particular, with Rawls' theory of justice.{{sfn|Contestabile|Negative Utilitarianism and Justice}} Rawls knew Popper’s normative claims{{sfn|Rawls|1958|p=174}} and may have been influenced by his concern for the worst-off.

== Other works ==
[[Toby Ord]] provides a critique of negative utilitarianism in his essay "Why I'm Not a Negative Utilitarian,"{{sfn|Ord|2013}} to which [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]] and Bruno Contestabile have replied.{{sfn|Pearce|A response to Toby Ord's essay}}{{sfn|Contestabile|Why I’m (Not) a Negative Utilitarian – A Review of Toby Ord’s Essay}} Other critical views of negative utilitarianism are provided by Thaddeus Metz,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metz|2012|pages=1–2}}: "Negative utilitarianism is well-known for entailing anti-natalism as well as pro-mortalism, the view that it is often prudent for individuals to kill themselves and often right for them to kill others, even without their consent. It pretty clearly has these implications if one can kill oneself or others painlessly, but probably does so even if there would be terror beforehand; for there would be terror regardless of when death comes, and if death were to come sooner rather than later, then additional bads that would have been expected in the course of a life would be nipped in the bud."&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Belshaw,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belshaw|2012|page=118}}: "Negative utilitarianism can be plucked from the shelf, but there is no good reason to suppose it true. And were it true, it would take us too far, generating not only anti-natalism but straightaway also its pro-mortalist neighbour."&lt;/ref&gt; and Ingmar Persson.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Persson|2009|page=38}}: “negative utilitarianism seems implausible, as is shown by an argument sketched by McMahan, on the basis of an argument originally put forward by Richard Sikora (1978). This argument turns on the observation that if what would be bad for individuals in life is a reason against conceiving them, but what would be good for them is no reason in favour of conceiving them, then, as far as those individuals are concerned, it is wrong to conceive them, however much good their lives will contain, provided that they will also contain something that is bad for them. This seems clearly absurd.”&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Joseph Mendola develops a modification of utilitarianism, and he says that his principle

{{quote|is a kind of maximin rule.... The principle also resembles a form of utilitarianism which is familiar from the work of Popper and the Smart brothers, negative utilitarianism. That too suggests we should concern ourselves before all else with the elimination of pain.{{sfn|Mendola|1990|p=86}}}} Professor Henry Hiz writes favorably of negative utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiz|1992|page=423}}: "Utilitarianism failed, but what is sometimes called ‘negative utilitarianism’ avoids many of the shortcomings of classical utilitarianism. It is a good candidate for an ethics that expresses the Enlightenment tradition."&lt;/ref&gt; Fabian Fricke published the German article "Verschiedene Versionen des negativen Utilitarismus."{{sfn|Fricke|2002}} In book format, Jonathan Leighton has defended 'negative utilitarianism plus', which holds the reduction of suffering to be of highest importance, while also valuing the continued existence of sentient beings.{{sfn|Leighton|2011}}

'''Orbital perturbation analysis''' is the activity of determining why a [[satellite|satellite's]] orbit differs from the mathematical ideal orbit.  A satellite's [[Kepler orbit|orbit]] in an ideal two-body system describes a conic section, usually an ellipse.  In reality, there are several factors that cause the conic section to continually change.  These deviations from the ideal Kepler's orbit are called [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]].

==History, for example, of the lunar orbit==
It has long been recognized that the [[Lunar theory|Moon]] does not follow a perfect orbit, and many theories and models have been examined over the millennia to explain it. [[Isaac Newton]] determined the primary contributing factor to orbital perturbation of the moon was that the shape of the Earth is actually an [[oblate spheroid]] due to its spin, and he used the perturbations of the lunar orbit to estimate the oblateness of the Earth.{{dubious|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In Newton's [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]], he demonstrated that the gravitational force between two mass points is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the points, and he fully solved the corresponding [[Kepler orbit|"two-body problem"]] demonstrating that the radius vector between the two points would describe an ellipse. But no exact closed analytical form could be found for the [[three-body problem]].  Instead, mathematical models called "orbital perturbation analysis" have been developed. With these techniques a quite accurate mathematical description of the trajectories of all the planets could be obtained.  Newton recognized that the Moon's perturbations could not entirely be accounted for using just the solution to the three-body problem, as the deviations from a pure Kepler orbit around the Earth are much larger than deviations of the orbits of the planets from their own Sun-centered Kepler orbits, caused by the gravitational attraction between the planets. With the availability of digital computers and the ease with which we can now compute orbits, this problem has partly disappeared, as the motion of all celestial bodies including planets, satellites, asteroids and comets can be modeled and predicted with almost perfect accuracy using the method of the numerical propagation of the trajectories. Nevertheless, several analytical closed form expressions for the effect of such additional "perturbing forces" are still very useful.

The precise modeling of the motion of the Moon has been a difficult task. The best and most accurate modeling for the lunar orbit before the availability of digital computers was obtained with the complicated [[Charles-Eugène Delaunay|Delaunay]] and [[Ernest William Brown|Brown]]'s [[lunar theory|lunar theories]].

==In general==
All celestial bodies of the [[Solar System]] follow in first approximation a [[Kepler orbit]] around a central body. For a satellite (artificial or natural) this central body is a planet. But both due to gravitational forces caused by the Sun and other celestial bodies and due to the flattening of its planet (caused by its rotation which makes the planet slightly oblate and therefore the result of the [[Shell theorem]] not fully applicable) the satellite will follow an orbit around the Earth that deviates more than the Kepler orbits observed for the planets.

==Perturbation of spacecraft orbits==
For man-made spacecraft orbiting the Earth at comparatively low altitudes the deviations from a Kepler orbit are much larger than for the Moon. The approximation of the gravitational force of the Earth to be that of a homogeneous sphere gets worse the closer one gets to the Earth surface and the majority of the artificial Earth satellites are in orbits that are only a few hundred kilometers over the Earth surface.  Furthermore, they are (as opposed to the Moon) significantly affected by the [[solar radiation pressure]] because of their large cross-section-to-mass ratio; this applies in particular to [[3-axis stabilized spacecraft]] with large [[solar arrays]] and is allowed for in calculation of [[graveyard orbit]]s. In addition they are significantly affected by rarefied air below 800–1000&amp;nbsp;km. The air drag at high altitudes is also dependent on [[Space weather|solar activity]].

==Mathematical approach==

Consider any function 
:&lt;math&gt;g(x_1,x_2,x_3,v_1,v_2,v_3)\,&lt;/math&gt;

of the position
:&lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,x_3\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the velocity
:&lt;math&gt;v_1,v_2,v_3\,&lt;/math&gt;

From the chain rule of differentiation one gets that the time derivative of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{g}\ =\ \frac{\partial g }{\partial x_1}\ v_1\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial x_2}\ v_2\ + \frac{\partial g }{\partial x_3}\ v_3\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_1}\ f_1\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_2}\ f_2\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_3}\ f_3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_1\ ,\ f_2\ ,\ f_3&lt;/math&gt; are the components of the force per unit mass acting on the body.

If now &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a "constant of motion" for a [[Kepler orbit]] like for example an [[orbital element]] and the force is corresponding "Kepler force"
:&lt;math&gt;
(f_1\ ,\ f_2\ ,\ f_3)\  = \ - \frac {\mu} {r^3}\ (x_1\ ,\ x_2\ ,\ x_3)
&lt;/math&gt;
one has that &lt;math&gt;\dot{g}\ =\ 0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

If the force is the sum of the "Kepler force" and an additional force (force per unit mass)

:&lt;math&gt;(h_1\ ,\ h_2\ ,\ h_3)&lt;/math&gt;

i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;
(f_1\ ,\ f_2\ ,\ f_3)\  = \ - \frac {\mu} {r^3}\ (x_1\ ,\ x_2\ ,\ x_3)\ +\ (h_1\ ,\ h_2\ ,\ h_3)
&lt;/math&gt;

one therefore has

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{g}\ =\frac{\partial g }{\partial v_1}\ h_1\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_2}\ h_2\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_3}\ h_3&lt;/math&gt;

and that the change of &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; in the time from &lt;math&gt;t=t_1\,&lt;/math&gt; to  &lt;math&gt;t=t_2\,&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta g\ =\ \int\limits_{t_1}^{t_2}\left(\frac{\partial g }{\partial v_1}\ h_1\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_2}\ h_2\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_3}\ h_3 \right)dt
&lt;/math&gt;

If now the additional force &lt;math&gt;(h_1\ ,\ h_2\ ,\ h_3)\,&lt;/math&gt; is sufficiently small that the motion will be close to that of a [[Kepler orbit]] one gets an approximate value for &lt;math&gt;\Delta g\,&lt;/math&gt; by evaluating this integral assuming 
&lt;math&gt;x_1(t),x_2(t),x_3(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; to precisely follow this [[Kepler orbit]].

In general one wants to find an approximate expression for the change  &lt;math&gt;\Delta g\,&lt;/math&gt; over one orbital revolution using the true anomaly &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; as integration variable, i.e. as
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta g\ =\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(\frac{\partial g }{\partial v_1}\ h_1\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_2}\ h_2\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_3}\ h_3 \right)\frac{r^2}{\sqrt{\mu p}}d\theta
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

This integral is evaluated setting &lt;math&gt;r(\theta)=\frac {p}{1+e\cos \theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;, the elliptical Kepler orbit in polar angles.
For the transformation of integration variable from time to [[true anomaly]] it was used that the angular momentum &lt;math&gt;H\ =\ r^2\ \dot{\theta}\ =\ \sqrt{\mu p} \,&lt;/math&gt; by definition of the parameter &lt;math&gt;p\,&lt;/math&gt; for a Kepler orbit (see equation (13) of the [[Kepler orbit]] article).

For the special case where the Kepler orbit is circular or almost circular
:&lt;math&gt;r\ =\ p&lt;/math&gt; and ({{EquationNote|1}}) takes the simpler form
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta g\ =\ \frac{P}{2\pi}\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(\frac{\partial g }{\partial v_1}\ h_1\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_2}\ h_2\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_3}\ h_3 \right)d\theta
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;P\ =\ 2\pi\ r\ \sqrt{\frac{r}{\mu}}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the orbital period

===Perturbation of the semi-major axis/orbital period===

For an elliptic [[Kepler orbit]], the sum of the kinetic and the potential energy

:&lt;math&gt;g = \frac{V^2}{2}-\frac {\mu} {r}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; is the orbital velocity, is a constant and equal to

:&lt;math&gt;g\ =\ -\frac {\mu} {2 \cdot a}&lt;/math&gt; (Equation ([[Kepler orbit#equation 44|44]]) of the Kepler orbit article)

If &lt;math&gt;\bar{h}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the perturbing force and &lt;math&gt;\bar{V}\,&lt;/math&gt;is the velocity vector of the Kepler orbit the equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) takes the form:

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta g\ =\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\bar{V} \bar{h}\frac{r^2}{\sqrt{\mu p}}d\theta
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

and for a circular or almost circular orbit

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta g\ =\ \frac{P}{2\pi}\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \bar{V} \bar{h}d\theta
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

From the change &lt;math&gt;\Delta g\,&lt;/math&gt; of the parameter &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; the new semi-major axis &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; and the new period &lt;math&gt;P\ =\ 2\pi\ a\ \sqrt{\frac{a}{\mu}}\,&lt;/math&gt; are computed (relations (43) and (44) of the [[Kepler orbit]] article).

===Perturbation of the orbital plane===

Let &lt;math&gt;\hat{g}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt; make up a rectangular coordinate system in the plane of the reference Kepler orbit. If &lt;math&gt;\omega\,&lt;/math&gt; is the argument of perigee relative the &lt;math&gt;\hat{g}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt; coordinate system the true anomaly &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\theta=u-\omega\,&lt;/math&gt; and the approximate change &lt;math&gt; \Delta \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; of the orbital pole &lt;math&gt; \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; (defined as the unit vector in the direction of the angular momentum) is
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{f_z }{V_t} (\hat{g} \cos u  + \hat{h} \sin u)\frac{r^2}{\sqrt{\mu p}}du \quad \times \ \hat{z}
=\ \frac{1}{\mu p}\left[\hat{g}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}f_z r^3 \cos u \ du
+\ \hat{h}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}f_z r^3 \sin u \ du \right]\quad \times \ \hat{z}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;f_z\,&lt;/math&gt; is the component of the perturbing force in the &lt;math&gt; \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; direction, &lt;math&gt;V_t=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{p}}\ (1+e\ \cos\theta)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity component of the Kepler orbit orthogonal to radius vector and &lt;math&gt;r=\frac{p}{1+e\ \cos\theta}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the center of the Earth.
 
For a circular or almost circular orbit ({{EquationNote|5}}) simplifies to

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ \frac{r^2}{\mu}\left[\hat{g}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}f_z \cos u \ du
+\ \hat{h}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}f_z \sin u \ du \right]\quad \times \ \hat{z}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

'''Example'''

In a circular orbit a low-force propulsion system ([[Ion thruster]]) generates a thrust (force per unit mass) of &lt;math&gt;F\  \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of the orbital pole in the half of the orbit for which &lt;math&gt;\sin u\,&lt;/math&gt; is positive and in the opposite direction in the other half. The resulting change of orbit pole after one orbital revolution of duration &lt;math&gt;P\ =\ 2\pi\ r\ \sqrt{\frac{r}{\mu}}\,&lt;/math&gt; is

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ \frac{r^2}{\mu}\left[\ 2\ F\int\limits_{0}^{\pi}\sin u \ du \right]\quad \hat{h}\times \hat{z} =
\ \frac{r^2}{\mu}\ 4\ F\ \quad \hat{g}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

The average change rate &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta \hat{z}}{P}\,&lt;/math&gt; is therefore

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Delta \hat{z}}{P} =\ \frac{2}{\pi}\ \frac{F}{V}\ \hat{g}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;V\ =\ \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{r}},&lt;/math&gt; is the orbital velocity in the circular Kepler orbit.

===Perturbation of the eccentricity vector===

Rather than applying (1) and (2) on the partial derivatives of the orbital elements '''eccentricity''' and '''argument of perigee''' directly one should apply these relations for the [[eccentricity vector]]. First of all the typical application is a near-circular orbit. But there are also mathematical advantages working with the partial derivatives of the components of this vector also for orbits with a significant eccentricity.

Equations (60), (55) and (52) of the [[Kepler orbit]] article say that the eccentricity vector is
 
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\bar{e}=\frac{(V_t-V_0) \cdot \hat{r} - V_r \cdot \hat{t}}{V_0}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

where

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;V_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{p}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{{(r \cdot V_t)}^2}{\mu }&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|11}}}}

from which follows that

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\bar{e}}{\partial V_r} = -\frac {1}{V_0} \hat{t}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|12}}}}
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\bar{e}}{\partial V_t} = \frac {1}{V_0} \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|13}}}}

where

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;V_r = \sqrt{\frac {\mu}{p}} \cdot e \cdot \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|14}}}}
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;V_t = \sqrt{\frac {\mu}{p}} \cdot (1 + e \cdot \cos \theta)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|15}}}}

(Equations (18) and (19) of the [[Kepler orbit]] article)

The eccentricity vector is by definition always in the [[Osculating orbit|osculating]] orbital plane spanned by &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{t}&lt;/math&gt; and formally there is also a derivative 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\bar{e}}{\partial V_z} = -\frac {V_r}{V_0}\  \frac{\partial\hat{t}}{\partial V_z}&lt;/math&gt;

with
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\hat{t}}{\partial V_z} =  \frac {1}{V_t}\ \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;

corresponding to the rotation of the orbital plane

But in practice the in-plane change of the eccentricity vector is computed as

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Delta \bar{e}\ = &amp;\frac {1}{V_0}\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(-\hat{t}\ f_r\ + \ \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)\ f_t\right)\frac{r^2}{\sqrt{\mu p}}du\ = \\
&amp;\frac {1}{\mu}\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(-\hat{t}\ f_r\ + \ \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)\ f_t\right) r^2 du \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|16}}}}

ignoring the out-of-plane force and the new eccentricity vector 
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{e} + \Delta \bar{e}&lt;/math&gt;
is subsequently projected to the new orbital plane orthogonal to the new orbit normal
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{z} + \Delta \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;
computed as described above.

'''Example'''

The Sun is in the orbital plane of a spacecraft in a circular orbit with radius &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; and consequently with a constant orbital velocity &lt;math&gt;V_0\ =\ \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{r}}&lt;/math&gt; . If &lt;math&gt;\hat{k}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{l}\,&lt;/math&gt; make up a rectangular coordinate system in the orbital plane such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{k}\,&lt;/math&gt; points to the Sun and assuming that the solar radiation pressure force per unit mass &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; is constant  one gets that 
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}=\cos(u)\ \hat{k}\ +\ \sin(u)\ \hat{l}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{t}=-\sin(u)\ \hat{k}\ +\ \cos(u)\ \hat{l}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_r=-\cos(u)\ F\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_t= \sin(u)\ F\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u\,&lt;/math&gt; is the polar angle of &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{k}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{l}\,&lt;/math&gt; system. Applying ({{EquationNote|2}}) one gets that

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Delta \hat{e}\ &amp; =\ \frac{P}{2\pi}\ \frac {1}{V_0}\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left( (-\sin(u)\ \hat{k}\ +\ \cos(u)\ \hat{l}) \ F\  \cos(u)\ + \ 2\ (\cos(u)\ \hat{k}\ +\ \sin(u)\ \hat{l})\ F\ \sin(u)\right)\ du \\
&amp; = P\ \frac{3}{2}\ \frac {1}{V_0}\ \ F\ \hat{l} 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|17}}}}

This means the eccentricity vector will gradually increase in the direction &lt;math&gt;\hat{l}\,&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to the Sun direction. This is true for any orbit with a small eccentricity, the direction of the small eccentricity vector does not matter.  As &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt; is the orbital period this means that the average rate of this increase will be 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2}\ \frac {F}{V_0}\,&lt;/math&gt;

==The effect of the Earth flattening==
[[File:Spherical coordinates unit vectors.svg|thumb|right|Figure 1: The unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{\phi}\ ,\ \hat{\lambda}\ ,\ \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt;]]
In the article [[Geopotential model]] the modeling of the gravitational field as a sum of spherical harmonics is discussed. By far, the dominating term is the "J2-term". This is a "zonal term" and corresponding force is therefore completely in a longitudinal plane with one component &lt;math&gt;F_r\ \hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the radial direction and one component &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda\ \hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt;  with the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to the radial direction towards north. These directions &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; are illustrated in Figure 1.

[[File:Zonal term force components.svg|thumb|right|Figure 2: The unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{t}\,&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of motion and the orbital pole &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt;. The force component &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is marked as "F"]]

To be able to apply relations derived in the previous section the force component &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda\ \hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; must be split into two orthogonal components &lt;math&gt;F_t\ \hat{t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_z\ \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt; as illustrated in figure 2

Let &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\ ,\ \hat{b}\ ,\ \hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; make up a rectangular coordinate system with origin in the center of the Earth (in the center of the [[Reference ellipsoid]])  such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; points in the direction north and such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\ ,\ \hat{b}\,&lt;/math&gt; are in the equatorial plane of the Earth with &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; pointing towards the [[Orbital node|ascending node]], i.e. towards the blue point of Figure 2.

The components of the unit vectors
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\ ,\ \hat{t}\ ,\ \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt;

making up the local coordinate system (of which &lt;math&gt;\hat{t}\ ,\ \hat{z},&lt;/math&gt; are illustrated in figure 2) relative the &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\ ,\ \hat{b}\ ,\ \hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt;r_a= \cos u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_b= \cos i \ \sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_n= \sin i \ \sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t_a=-\sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t_b= \cos i \ \cos u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t_n= \sin i \ \cos u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_a= 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_b=-\sin i\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_n= \cos i\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u\,&lt;/math&gt; is the polar argument of &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; relative the orthogonal unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{g}=\hat{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{h}=\cos i\ \hat{b}\ +\ \sin i\ \hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the orbital plane

Firstly

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \lambda =\ r_n\ =\ \sin i \ \sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the equator plane and &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; (between the green points of figure 2) and from equation (12) of the article [[Geopotential model]] one therefore gets that
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
f_r = J_2\ \frac{1}{r^4}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(3\ \sin^2 i\ \sin^2 u\ -\ 1\right)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|18}}}}

Secondly the projection of direction north, &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;, on the plane spanned by &lt;math&gt;\hat{t}\ ,\ \hat{z},&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\sin i \ \cos u \ \hat{t}\ +\ \cos i \ \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and this projection is 
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \lambda \ \hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to the radial direction towards north illustrated in figure 1.

From equation (12) of the article [[Geopotential model]] one therefore gets that

:&lt;math&gt;f_\lambda \ \hat{\lambda}\ =\ -J_2\ \frac{1}{r^4}\ 3\ \sin\lambda\ (\sin i \ \cos u \ \hat{t}\ +\ \cos i \ \hat{z}) =\ -J_2\ \frac{1}{r^4}\ 3\ \sin i \ \sin u\ (\sin i \ \cos u \ \hat{t}\ +\ \cos i \ \hat{z})\,&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore:
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
f_t  =\ -J_2\ \frac{1}{r^4}\ 3\ \sin^2 i\ \sin u\ \cos u
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|19}}}}
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
f_z =\ -J_2\ \frac{1}{r^4}\ 3\ \sin i\ \cos i\ \sin u
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|20}}}}

===Perturbation of the orbital plane===
From ({{EquationNote|5}}) and ({{EquationNote|20}}) one gets that

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ -J_2\ \frac{3\ \sin i\ \cos i}{\mu p^2}\left[\hat{g}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{p}{r}\ \sin u\ \cos u \ du
+\ \hat{h}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{p}{r}\ \sin^2 u\ du \right]\quad \times \ \hat{z}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|21}}}}

The fraction &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{r}\ =\ 1\ +\ e\ \cos (u-\omega)\ =\ 1\ +\ e\ \cos u\ \cos\omega\ +\ e\ \sin u\ \sin\omega\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;e\,&lt;/math&gt; is the eccentricity
and &lt;math&gt;\omega\,&lt;/math&gt; is the argument of perigee 
of the reference [[Kepler orbit]]

As all integrals of type
:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \cos^m u \ \sin^n u\ du\,&lt;/math&gt;
are zero if not both &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\,&lt;/math&gt; are even one gets from ({{EquationNote|21}}) that

:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac{J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \sin i\ \cos i\ \quad \hat{h} \times \hat{z}
&lt;/math&gt;

As
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{n}\ =\ \cos i\ \hat{z}\ + \sin i\ \hat{h}
&lt;/math&gt;

this can be written
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac{J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\ \quad \hat{n} \times \hat{z}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|22}}}}

As  &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}&lt;/math&gt; is an inertially fixed vector (the direction of the spin axis of the Earth) relation ({{EquationNote|22}}) is the equation of motion for a unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; describing a cone around &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}&lt;/math&gt; with a precession rate (radians per orbit) of &lt;math&gt;-2\pi\ \frac{J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\,&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of orbital elements this is expressed as

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta i\ =\ 0
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|23}}}}
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \Omega\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac{J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|24}}}}

where
:&lt;math&gt;i\,&lt;/math&gt; is the inclination of the orbit to the equatorial plane of the Earth

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega\,&lt;/math&gt; is the right ascension of the ascending node

===Perturbation of the eccentricity vector===

From ({{EquationNote|16}}), ({{EquationNote|18}}) and ({{EquationNote|19}}) follows that in-plane perturbation of the eccentricity vector is

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \bar{e}\ =\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(-\hat{t}\ \left(\frac{p}{r}\right)^2\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(3\ \sin^2 i\ \sin^2 u\ -\ 1\right)\ - \ \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)\ \left(\frac{p}{r}\right)^2\ 3\ \sin^2 i \cos u\ \sin u\right)du 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|25}}}}

the new eccentricity vector being the projection of 
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{e}+\Delta \bar{e}&lt;/math&gt;

on the new orbital plane orthogonal to
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{z}+\Delta \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; is given by ({{EquationNote|22}})

Relative the coordinate system
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{g}=\hat{a}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{h}=\cos i\ \hat{b}\ +\ \sin i\ \hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;

one has that

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}=\cos u\ \hat{g}\ +\ \sin u\ \hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{t}=-\sin u\ \hat{g}\ +\ \cos u\ \hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Using that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {p}{r}\ =\ 1 + e \cdot \cos \theta\ =\ 1 + e_g \cdot \cos u + e_h \cdot \sin u&lt;/math&gt;
and that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V_r}{V_t} = \frac {e_g \cdot \sin u\ -\ e_h \cdot \cos u}{\frac {p}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;e_g =\ e\ \cos \omega&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e_h =\ e\ \sin \omega&lt;/math&gt;

are the components of the eccentricity vector in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{g}\ ,\ \hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt; coordinate system this integral ({{EquationNote|25}}) can be evaluated analytically, the result is

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \bar{e}\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{3}{2}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ \left(-e_h \hat{g}\ +\ e_g \hat{h}\right)\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2} \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{3}{2}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ \hat{z}\ \times \  \bar{e}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|26}}}}

This the difference equation of motion for the eccentricity vector &lt;math&gt;\bar{e}\,&lt;/math&gt; to form a circle, the magnitude of the eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e\,&lt;/math&gt; staying constant.

Translating this to orbital elements it must be remembered that the new eccentricity vector obtained by adding &lt;math&gt;\Delta \bar{e}\ \,&lt;/math&gt; to the old &lt;math&gt;\bar{e}\ \,&lt;/math&gt; must be projected to the new orbital plane obtained by applying ({{EquationNote|23}}) and ({{EquationNote|24}})

[[File:J2-perturbation.svg|thumb|right|Figure 3: The change &lt;math&gt;\Delta\omega\,&lt;/math&gt; in "argument of perigee" after one orbit is the sum of a contribution &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega_1\,&lt;/math&gt; caused by the in-plane force components and a contribution &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega_2\,&lt;/math&gt; caused by the use of the ascending node as reference]]
This is illustrated  in figure 3:

To the change in argument of the eccentricity vector

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega_1\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{3}{2}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

must be added an increment due to the precession of the orbital plane (caused by the out-of-plane force component) amounting to

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega_2\ =\ -\cos i\ \Delta\Omega \ =\ 2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos^2 i\,&lt;/math&gt;

One therefore gets that

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta e\ =0
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|27}}}}

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \omega\ =\Delta \omega_1\ +\ \Delta \omega_2\ =\ \ -2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ 3 \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|28}}}}

In terms of the components of the eccentricity vector &lt;math&gt;e_g,e_h\,&lt;/math&gt; relative the coordinate system &lt;math&gt;\hat{g} ,\hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt; that precesses around the polar axis of the Earth the same is expressed as follows

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;(\Delta e_g,\Delta e_h)\ = \\
&amp;-2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{3}{2}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ (-e_h ,e_g)\ + \ 2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos^2 i\ (-e_h ,e_g ) = \\
&amp;-2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ 3 \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ (-e_h ,e_g) 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|29}}}}

where the first term is the in-plane perturbation of the eccentricity vector and the second is the effect of the new position of the ascending node in the new plane

From ({{EquationNote|28}}) follows that &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega\,&lt;/math&gt; is zero if &lt;math&gt;\sin^2 i\ =\frac{4}{5}\,&lt;/math&gt;. This fact is used for [[Molniya orbit]]s having an inclination of 63.4 deg. An orbit with an inclination of 180 - 63.4 deg = 116.6 deg would in the same way have a constant argument of perigee.

====Proof====

Proof that the integral

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(-\hat{t}\ \left(\frac{p}{r}\right)^2\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(3\ \sin^2 i\ \sin^2 u\ -\ 1\right)\ - \ \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)\ \left(\frac{p}{r}\right)^2\ 3\ \sin^2 i \cos u\ \sin u\right)du 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|30}}}}

where:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}=\cos u\ \hat{G}\ +\ \sin u\ \hat{H}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{t}=-\sin u\ \hat{G}\ +\ \cos u\ \hat{H}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{r}\ =\ 1\ +\ e_g\ \cos u\ +\ e_h\ \sin u&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ =\ \frac{e_g\ \sin u\ -\ e_h\ \cos u}{\frac{p}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

has the value 
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
-2\pi\  \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{3}{2}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ \left(-e_h \hat{G}\ +\ e_g \hat{H}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|31}}}}

Integrating the first term of the integrand one gets:

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;

The [[Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity|'''asymptotic safety''']] approach to [[quantum gravity]] provides a nonperturbative notion of [[renormalization]] in order to find a consistent and predictive [[quantum field theory]] of the [[Gravitation|gravitational interaction]] and [[spacetime]] geometry. It is based upon a nontrivial fixed point of the corresponding [[renormalization group]] (RG) flow such that the running [[coupling constants]] approach this [[UV fixed point|fixed point]] in the ultraviolet (UV) limit. This suffices to avoid divergences in physical observables. Moreover, it has predictive power: Generically an arbitrary starting configuration of coupling constants given at some RG scale does not run into the fixed point for increasing scale, but a subset of configurations might have the desired UV properties. For this reason it is possible that — assuming a particular set of couplings has been measured in an experiment — the requirement of [[Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity|asymptotic safety]] fixes all remaining couplings in such a way that the UV fixed point is approached.

Asymptotic safety, if realized in Nature, has far reaching consequences in all areas where quantum effects of gravity are to be expected. Their exploration, however, is still in its infancy. By now there are some phenomenological studies concerning the implications of asymptotic safety in [[particle physics]], [[astrophysics]] and [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]], for instance.

== Asymptotic safety and the parameters of the Standard Model ==

=== The mass of the Higgs boson ===

The [[Standard Model]] in combination with [[Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity|asymptotic safety]] might be valid up to arbitrarily high energies. Based on the assumption that this is indeed correct it is possible to make a statement about the [[Higgs boson]] mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Callaway|first1=D.|last2=Petronzio|first2=R.|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(87)90657-2|title=Is the standard model Higgs mass predictable?|journal=[[Nuclear Physics B]]|volume=292|pages=497|year=1987|bibcode=1987NuPhB.292..497C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first concrete results were obtained by Shaposhnikov and [[Christof Wetterich|Wetterich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaposhnikov|first=Mikhail|author2=Wetterich, Christof|title=Asymptotic safety of gravity and the Higgs boson mass|journal=Physics Letters B|year=2010|volume=683|issue=2-3|pages=196–200|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2009.12.022|arxiv=0912.0208|bibcode = 2010PhLB..683..196S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Depending on the sign of the gravity induced [[anomalous dimension]] &lt;math&gt;A_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; there are two possibilities: For &lt;math&gt;A_\lambda&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; the Higgs mass &lt;math&gt;m_\text{H}&lt;/math&gt; is restricted to the window &lt;math&gt;126\,\text{GeV} &lt; m_\text{H} &lt; 174\,\text{GeV}&lt;/math&gt;. If, on the other hand, &lt;math&gt;A_\lambda&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; which is the favored possibility, &lt;math&gt;m_\text{H}&lt;/math&gt; must take the value
:&lt;math&gt;
m_\text{H}=126\,\text{GeV} ,
&lt;/math&gt;
with an uncertainty of a few GeV only. In this spirit one can consider &lt;math&gt;m_\text{H}&lt;/math&gt; a prediction of asymptotic safety. The result is in surprisingly good agreement with the latest experimental data measured at [[CERN]] by the [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] collaborations.

=== The fine structure constant ===

By taking into account the gravitational correction to the running of the [[fine structure constant]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of [[quantum electrodynamics]], Harst and Reuter were able to study the impacts of asymptotic safety on the infrared (renormalized) value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harst|first=Ulrich|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=QED coupled to QEG|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|year=2011|volume=2011|issue=5|pages=119|doi=10.1007/JHEP05(2011)119|arxiv=1101.6007|bibcode = 2011JHEP...05..119H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They found two [[UV fixed point|fixed points]] suitable for the asymptotic safety construction both of which imply a well-behaved UV limit, without running into a [[Landau pole]] type singularity. The first one is characterized by a vanishing &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and the infrared value &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\text{IR}&lt;/math&gt; is a free parameter. In the second case, however, the fixed point value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero, and its infrared value is a computable prediction of the theory.

In a more recent study, Christiansen and Eichhorn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=Nicolai|author2=Eichhorn, Astrid|title=An asymptotically safe solution to the U(1) triviality problem|journal=Physics Letters B|year=2017|volume=770|pages=154-160|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2017.04.047|arxiv=1702.07724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that quantum fluctuations of gravity generically generate self-interactions for gauge theories, which have to be included in a discussion of a potential ultraviolet completion. Depending on the gravitational and gauge parameters, they conclude that the fine structure constant &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; might be asymptotically free and not run into a [[Landau pole]], while the induced coupling for the gauge self-interaction is irrelevant and thus its value can be predicted. This is an explicit example where Asymptotic Safety solves a problem of the [[Standard Model]] - the triviality of the U(1) sector - without introducing new free parameters.

== Asymptotic safety in astrophysics and cosmology ==

Phenomenological consequences of asymptotic safety can be expected also for [[astrophysics]] and [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]]. Bonanno and Reuter investigated the [[Event horizon|horizon]] structure of "[[renormalization group]] improved" [[black hole]]s and computed quantum gravity corrections to the [[Hawking radiation|Hawking temperature]] and the corresponding thermodynamical [[entropy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonanno|first=Alfio|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Renormalization group improved black hole spacetimes|journal=Physical Review D|year=2000|volume=62|issue=4|pages=043008|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.62.043008|arxiv=hep-th/0002196|bibcode = 2000PhRvD..62d3008B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By means of an RG improvement of the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]], Reuter and Weyer obtained a modified version of the [[Einstein equations]] which in turn results in a [[Modified Newtonian Dynamics|modification of the Newtonian limit]], providing a possible explanation for the observed flat [[galaxy rotation curve]]s without having to postulate the presence of [[dark matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reuter|first=Martin|author2=Weyer, Holger|title=Running Newton constant, improved gravitational actions, and galaxy rotation curves|journal=Physical Review D|year=2004|volume=70|issue=12|pages=124028|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.70.124028|arxiv=hep-th/0410117|bibcode = 2004PhRvD..70l4028R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for cosmology, Bonanno and Reuter argued that asymptotic safety modifies the very early Universe, possibly leading to a resolution to the [[Horizon problem|horizon]] and [[flatness problem]] of standard cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonanno|first=Alfio|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Cosmology of the Planck era from a renormalization group for quantum gravity|journal=Physical Review D|year=2002|volume=65|issue=4|pages=043508|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.043508|arxiv=hep-th/0106133|bibcode = 2002PhRvD..65d3508B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, asymptotic safety provides the possibility of [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] without the need of an [[inflaton|inflaton field]] (while driven by the [[cosmological constant]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonanno|first=Alfio|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Entropy signature of the running cosmological constant|journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|year=2007|volume=2007|issue=08|pages=024|doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2007/08/024|arxiv=0706.0174|bibcode = 2007JCAP...08..024B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was reasoned that the [[scale invariance]] related to the non-Gaussian fixed point underlying asymptotic safety is responsible for the near scale invariance of the [[Structure formation#Very early universe|primordial density perturbations]]. Using different methods, asymptotically safe inflation was analyzed further by Weinberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinberg|first=Steven|title=Asymptotically safe inflation|journal=Physical Review D|year=2010|volume=81|issue=8|pages=083535|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.81.083535|arxiv=0911.3165|bibcode = 2010PhRvD..81h3535W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A belief in the '''primacy of mind''' is {{cns|an ubiquitous element in the [[history of ideas]]|date=November 2018}}. In this view the [[mind]] or [[soul]] is not only [[Idealism|primary as an explanation of reality]], but is the only conceivable explanation, as nothing so subtle and sublime as reason and morality could possibly [[Materialism|emerge from matter and motion]], the primary elements of scientific explanation.{{cn|date=November 2018}} In his book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] states that a central aspect of Judeo-Christian and Islamic [[cosmogony]] is that, in the beginning, there was "something with Mind—'a cogitative Being,'".&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D. C., ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life]]'', 1995, p26, {{ISBN|0-684-82471-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1982">'''Psychical inertia''' is a term introduced by [[Carl Jung]] to describe the psyche's resistance to development and change.  He considered it one of the main reason for the neurotic opposing, or shrinking from, his/her age-appropriate tasks in life.&lt;ref&gt;M. Jacoby, ''Individuation and Narcissism'' (2013) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freudian and other developments==
[[Freud]] argued that such psychic inertia played a part in the lives of the normal, as well as of the neurotic,&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 358-9&lt;/ref&gt; and saw its origins in [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] between early instincts and their first impressions of significant objects.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 157-8&lt;/ref&gt; As late as ''[[Civilization and its Discontents]]'', he considered as a major obstacle to cultural development "the inertia of the [[libido]], its disinclination to give up an old position for a new one".&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 129) p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Jungians have seen psychic inertia as a force of nature reflecting both internal and outer determinants;&lt;ref&gt;K. Evera-Fahey, ''Towards a Jungian Theory of the Ego'' (2016) p. 68-9&lt;/ref&gt; while others have seen it as the product of social pressures, especially in relation to ageing.&lt;ref&gt;L. Woodward ed., ''Figuring Age'' (1999) p. 133 and 141&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''reversal test''' is a [[heuristic]] designed to spot and eliminate the [[status quo bias]].

==The reversal test==

The reversal test was introduced in the context of the [[bioethics]] of  [[human enhancement]] by [[Nick Bostrom]] and [[Toby Ord]].&lt;ref&gt;Nick Bostrom, Toby Ord (2006). "The reversal test: eliminating status quo bias in applied ethics". ''Ethics'' (University of Chicago Press) 116 (4): 656–679. http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/statusquo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Given that humans might suffer from irrational status quo bias, how can one distinguish between valid criticisms of proposed increase in some human trait and criticisms merely motivated by resistance to change? The reversal test attempts to do this by asking whether it would be a good thing if the trait was ''decreased'': An example given is that if someone objects that an increase in intelligence would be a bad thing due to more dangerous weapons being made etc., the objector to that position would then ask "Shouldn't we decrease intelligence then?"

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Reversal Test'': When a proposal to change a certain parameter is thought to have bad overall consequences, consider a change to the same parameter in the opposite direction. If this is also thought to have bad overall consequences, then the onus is on those who reach these conclusions to explain why our position cannot be improved through changes to this parameter. If they are unable to do so, then we have reason to suspect that they suffer from status quo bias." (p. 664)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ideally the test will help reveal whether status quo bias is an important causal factor in the initial judgement.

A similar thought experiment in regards to dampening traumatic memories was described by Adam J. Kolber, imagining whether aliens naturally resistant to traumatic memories should adopt traumatic "memory enhancement".&lt;ref&gt;Kolber, Adam J., Therapeutic Forgetting: The Legal and Ethical Implications of Memory Dampening. ''Vanderbilt Law Review'', Vol. 59, p. 1561, 2006; San Diego Legal Studies Paper No. 07-37 http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=887061&lt;/ref&gt; The "trip to reality" rebuttal to Nozick's [[experience machine]] thought experiment (where one's entire current life is shown to be a simulation and one is offered to return to reality) can also be seen as a form of reversal test.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Weijers, Intuitive Biases in Judgments about Thought Experiments: the Experience Machine Revisited, ''Philosophical Writings'', No. 50 &amp; No. 51, Summer &amp; Autumn 2011 http://danweijers.com/pdf/Intuitive%20Biases%20in%20Judgments%20about%20Thought%20Experiments%20%28Dan%20Weijers%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double reversal test==

A further elaboration on the reversal test is suggested as the double reversal test:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''Double Reversal Test'': Suppose it is thought that increasing a certain parameter and decreasing it would both have bad overall consequences. Consider a scenario in which a natural factor threatens to move the parameter in one direction and ask whether it would be good to counterbalance this change by an intervention to preserve the status quo. If so, consider a later time when the naturally occurring factor is about to vanish and ask whether it would be a good idea to intervene to reverse the first intervention. If not, then there is a strong [[prima facie]] case for thinking that it would be good to make the first intervention even in the absence of the natural countervailing factor." (p. 673)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this case the status quo bias is turned against itself, hopefully reducing its impact on the reasoning. It also handles possible arguments from evolutionary adaptation, transition costs, risk, and person-affecting morality that might otherwise complicate the simple reversal test.

==Criticisms==

[[Alfred Nordmann]] argues that the simple reversal test merely erects a [[Straw man|straw-man]] argument in favour of enhancement. He also claims that both tests ignore approaches that are neither [[consequentialist]] nor [[deontological]], plus that one cannot view humans as collections of parameters that can be optimized separately or without regard to their history.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Nordmann, If and Then: A Critique of Speculative NanoEthics, ''Nanoethics'' (2007) 1:31–46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Weidemann]] similarly argues that the double reversal test can muddy the water; weighing transition costs versus benefits might be the relevant practical ethical question in much future enhancement analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Weidemann, Towards a Heuristic for Nanoethics: The Onus of Proof in Applied Ethics. Uncovering Status Quo and Other Biases. In ''Size Matters: Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects of Nanbiotechnology and Nanomedicine'', Johann S. Ach, Christian Weidemann (eds.), LIT Verlag Münster 2009 (pp. 126–127)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9589">In [[semi-Riemannian geometry]], the '''Ricci decomposition''' is a way of breaking up the [[Riemann tensor|Riemann curvature tensor]] of a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] into pieces with useful individual algebraic properties.  This decomposition is of fundamental importance in Riemannian- and pseudo-Riemannian geometry.

==The pieces appearing in the decomposition==
The decomposition is
:&lt;math&gt;R_{abcd}= \, S_{abcd}+E_{abcd}+C_{abcd}.&lt;/math&gt;
The three pieces are:
# the ''scalar part'', the tensor &lt;math&gt;S_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
# the ''semi-[[traceless]] part'', the tensor &lt;math&gt;E_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
# the ''fully traceless part'', the [[Weyl tensor]] &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
Each piece possesses all the algebraic symmetries of the Riemann tensor itself, but has additional properties.

The decomposition can have different signs, depending on the Ricci curvature convention, and only makes sense if the dimension satisfies &lt;math&gt;n&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;.

The scalar part
:&lt;math&gt; S_{abcd} = \frac{R}{n \, (n-1)} \, H_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
is built using the [[scalar curvature]] &lt;math&gt;R = {R^m}_m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R_{ab}={R^c}_{acb}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Ricci curvature]], and a tensor constructed algebraically from the [[metric tensor]] &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;H_{abcd} =  g_{ac} \, g_{db} - g_{ad} \, g_{cb} = 2g_{a[c} \, g_{d]b}.&lt;/math&gt;

The semi-traceless part 
:&lt;math&gt;E_{abcd} = \frac{1}{n-2} \, \left( g_{ac} \, S_{bd} - g_{ad} \, S_{bc} + g_{bd} \, S_{ac} - g_{bc} \, S_{ad} \right) =
 \frac{2}{n-2} \, \left( g_{a[c} \, S_{d]b}  - g_{b[c} \, S_{d]a}  \right)  &lt;/math&gt;
is constructed algebraically using the metric tensor and the ''traceless part'' of the Ricci tensor
:&lt;math&gt; S_{ab} = R_{ab} - \frac{1}{n} \, g_{ab} \, R&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[metric tensor]].

The [[Weyl tensor]] &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; or ''conformal curvature tensor'' is completely traceless, in the sense that taking the trace, or [[tensor contraction|contraction]], over any pair of indices gives zero.  [[Hermann Weyl]] showed that this tensor measures the deviation of a semi-Riemannian manifold from ''[[conformal flatness]]''; if it vanishes, the manifold is (locally) [[conformal equivalence|conformally equivalent]] to a [[flat manifold]].

No additional differentiation is needed anywhere in this construction.

In the case of a [[Lorentzian manifold]], &lt;math&gt;n=4&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Einstein tensor]] &lt;math&gt;G_{ab} = R_{ab} - 1/2 \, g_{ab} R&lt;/math&gt; has, by design, a trace which is just the negative of the Ricci scalar, and one may check that the traceless part of the Einstein tensor agrees with the traceless part of the Ricci tensor.

:&lt;math&gt; S_{ab} = R_{ab} - \frac{1}{4} \, g_{ab} \, R = G_{ab} - \frac{1}{4} \, g_{ab} \, G&lt;/math&gt;

''Terminological note:'' the notation &lt;math&gt;R_{abcd}, \, C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is standard in the modern literature, the notations &lt;math&gt;S_{ab}, \, E_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; are commonly used but not standardized, and there is no standard notation for the scalar part.

==Mathematical definition==
Mathematically, the Ricci decomposition is the decomposition of the space of all [[tensor]]s having the symmetries of the Riemann tensor into its [[irreducible representation]]s for the action of the [[orthogonal group]] {{harv|Besse|1987|loc=Chapter 1, §G}}.  Let ''V'' be an ''n''-dimensional [[vector space]], equipped with a [[metric tensor]] (of possibly mixed signature).  Here ''V'' is modeled on the [[cotangent space]] at a point, so that a curvature tensor ''R'' (with all indices lowered) is an element of the [[tensor product]] ''V''&amp;otimes;''V''&amp;otimes;''V''&amp;otimes;''V''.  The curvature tensor is skew symmetric in its first and last two entries:
:&lt;math&gt;R(x,y,z,w)=-R(y,x,z,w)=-R(x,y,w,z)\,&lt;/math&gt;
and obeys the interchange symmetry
:&lt;math&gt;R(x,y,z,w) = R(z,w,x,y),\,&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'',''y'',''z'',''w''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''V''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;. As a result, ''R'' is an element of the subspace ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;Lambda;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V'', the second [[symmetric power]] of the second [[exterior power]] of ''V''.  A curvature tensor must also satisfy the Bianchi identity, meaning that it is in the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the linear map
:&lt;math&gt;b(R)(x,y,z,w) = R(x,y,z,w) + R(y,z,x,w) + R(z,x,y,w).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The space {{nowrap|1='''R'''''V''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ker ''b''}} in ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;Lambda;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' is the space of algebraic curvature tensors.  The Ricci decomposition is the decomposition of this space into irreducible factors.  The Ricci contraction mapping
:&lt;math&gt;c : S^2\Lambda^2 V \to S^2V&lt;/math&gt;
is given by
:&lt;math&gt;c(R)(x,y) = \operatorname{tr}R(x,\cdot,y,\cdot).&lt;/math&gt;
This associates a symmetric 2-form to an algebraic curvature tensor.  Conversely, given a pair of symmetric 2-forms ''h'' and ''k'', the [[Kulkarni–Nomizu product]] of ''h'' and ''k''
:&lt;math&gt;(h {~\wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc~} k)(x,y,z,w) = h(x,z)k(y,w)+h(y,w)k(x,z) -h(x,w)k(y,z)-h(y,z)k(x,w)&lt;/math&gt;
produces an algebraic curvature tensor.

If ''n'' &gt; 4, then there is an orthogonal decomposition into (unique) irreducible subspaces
:{{nowrap|1='''R'''''V'' = '''S'''''V'' &amp;oplus; '''E'''''V'' &amp;oplus; '''C'''''V''}}
where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}V = \mathbb{R} g {~\wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc~} g&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the space of [[real number|real]] scalars
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}V = g {~\wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc~} S^2_0V&lt;/math&gt;, where ''S''{{su|p=2|b=0}}''V'' is the space of trace-free symmetric 2-forms
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}V = \ker c \cap \ker b.&lt;/math&gt;

The parts ''S'', ''E'', and ''C'' of the Ricci decomposition of a given Riemann tensor ''R'' are the orthogonal projections of ''R'' onto these invariant factors.  In particular,
:&lt;math&gt;R = S + E + C&lt;/math&gt;
is an orthogonal decomposition in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;|R|^2 = |S|^2 + |E|^2 + |C|^2.&lt;/math&gt;
This decomposition expresses the space of tensors with Riemann symmetries as a direct sum of the scalar submodule, the Ricci submodule, and Weyl submodule, respectively.  Each of these modules is an [[irreducible representation]] for the [[orthogonal group]] {{harv|Singer|Thorpe|1968}}, and thus the Ricci decomposition is a special case of the splitting of a module for a [[semisimple Lie group]] into its irreducible factors.  In dimension 4, the Weyl module decomposes further into a pair of irreducible factors for the [[special orthogonal group]]: the [[self-dual]] and [[antiself-dual]] parts ''W''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Physical interpretation==
The Ricci decomposition can be interpreted physically in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]], where it is sometimes called the ''Géhéniau-Debever decomposition''. In this theory, the [[Einstein field equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; G_{ab} = 8 \pi \, T_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[stress–energy tensor]] describing the amount and motion of all matter and all nongravitational field energy and momentum, states that the Ricci tensor—or equivalently, the Einstein tensor—represents that part of the gravitational field which is due to the ''immediate presence'' of nongravitational energy and momentum.  The Weyl tensor represents the part of the gravitational field which can propagate as a [[gravitational wave]] through a region containing no matter or nongravitational fields.  Regions of spacetime in which the Weyl tensor vanishes contain no [[gravitational radiation]] and are also conformally flat.

{{Emotion}}

'''''Schadenfreude''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː|d|ən|f|r|ɔɪ|d|ə}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʃaːdn̩ˌfʁɔʏ̯də|lang|Schadenfreude-native-german.flac}}; {{abbrlink|lit.|literal translation}} 'harm-joy') is the experience of pleasure, joy, or self-satisfaction that comes from learning of or witnessing the troubles, failures, or humiliation of another. It is one of four related emotions or concepts.

Schadenfreude is a complex negative emotion. Rather than feeling sympathy towards someones misfortune, schadenfreude evokes joyful feelings that take pleasure from watching someone fail. This emotion is displayed more in children than adults, however adults also experience schadenfreude, they are just better at concealing their expressions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Paulus |first1=Shannon |title=Schadenfreude is a Childish Emotion |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/schadenfreude-childish-emotion-180952163/ |website=smithsonian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;,

== Etymology ==
''Schadenfreude'' is borrowed from [[German language|German]]; it is a compound of ''Schaden'', "damage, harm", and ''Freude'', "joy". The German word was first mentioned in English texts in 1852 and 1867, and first used in English running text in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1982, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/172271 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt; In German, it was first attested in the 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22schadenfreude%22&amp;lr=lang_de&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=lr%3Alang_1de%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F1600%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F1750&amp;tbm=bks Google Books] (the 1659 and 1700 dates are incorrect)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though [[Proper noun|common nouns]] are normally not capitalised in English, ''Schadenfreude'' is sometimes capitalised following the German [[German orthography#Spelling of nouns|convention]].

==What motivates schadenfreude==
Researchers have found that there are three driving forces behind schadenfreude: aggression, rivalry, and justice. The people who experience schadenfreude usually have low self esteem. Seeing another person fail brings them a small surge of confidence. Whereas, seeing someone who is successful poses as a threat to their sense of self and seeing the 'mighty' fall can be a source of comfort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hendricks |first1=Scotty |title=3 types of Schadenfreude and when you feel them |url=https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/schadenfreude-and-psychopathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

*Schadenfreude that is agression based involves group identity. With aggression based schadenfreude, it involves a group such as a team or family.

*Rivalry schadenfreude is individualistic. It happens when a person goes out of their way to dominate another persons actions in order to see them fail.

*Justice based schadenfreude is the type of joy a person experiences when someone gets busted for doing something wrong. For example, a successful person who cheats and robs finally gets caught for his wrongdoing, the schadenfreude experienced here would be justice.

== Synonyms ==
''Schadenfreude'' has equivalents in other languages (for example, German, Dutch, Arabic, Hebrew, Bangla, Czech, Norwegian and Finnish), but no commonly used precise English single-word equivalent. There are other ways to express the concept in English.

"Epicaricacy" is a seldom-used direct equivalent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Byrne |first=Josefa H. |year=1984 |title=Mrs. Byrne's Dictionary of Unusual, Obscure, and Preposterous Words |publisher=Pocket |location= |isbn=0-671-49782-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; borrowed from [[Greek lan

"[[Tall poppy syndrome]]" is a cultural phenomenon where people of high status are resented, attacked, cut down, or criticized because they have been classified as better than their peers. This is similar to begrudgery, the resentment or envy of the success of a peer. If someone were to feel joy by the victim’s fall from grace, they would be experiencing ''Schadenfreude''.

A "Roman holiday" is a metaphor from [[George Gordon, Lord Byron|Byron's]] poem ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'', where a [[gladiator]] in [[ancient Rome]] expects to be "butchered to make a Roman holiday" while the audience would take pleasure from watching his suffering. The term suggests debauchery and disorder in addition to sadistic enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Roman%20holiday |title=Roman holiday – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Morose delectation" (''delectatio morosa'' in [[Latin language|Latin]]), meaning "the habit of dwelling with enjoyment on evil thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/adorai/oed/morose definition of morose delectation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414034751/http://web.mit.edu/adorai/oed/morose |date=April 14, 2016}}, ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; was considered by the medieval church to be a sin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2074.htm#6 ''Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 74''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702011344/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2074.htm#6 |date=July 2, 2016}}, ''The [[Summa Theologica]] of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]'', Second and Revised Edition, 1920; Literally translated by Fathers of the English Dominican Province, Online Edition Copyright © 2006 by Kevin Knight.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RPUuyWtO3eoC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=%22morose+delectation%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QpmslAISN-&amp;sig=nL01zLP7iH1kR44-MBqhOGJilsc#PPA139,M1 ''Chapter 6 Proposing the Story of the World''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827225210/https://books.google.com/books?id=RPUuyWtO3eoC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=%22morose+delectation%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QpmslAISN-&amp;sig=nL01zLP7iH1kR44-MBqhOGJilsc#PPA139,M1 |date=August 27, 2016}}, Richard John Neuhaus, Catholic Matters: Confusion, Controversy, and the Splendor of Truth, Basic Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[France|French]] writer [[Pierre Klossowski]] maintained that the appeal of [[Sadomasochism|sadism]] is morose delectation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie//vol10/Religion.html ''Heterodox Religion and Post-Atheism: Bataille / Klossowski/ Foucault''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426064629/http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie/ |date=April 26, 2016}}, Jones Irwin, ISSN 1393-614X Minerva – An Internet Journal of Philosophy Vol. 10 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Klossowski|Klossowski, Pierre]]. 1991. ''Sade, My Neighbour'', translated by Alphonso Lingis. [[Illinois]]. [[Northwestern University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

"Gloating" is an English word of similar meaning, where "[[gloat]]" means "to observe or think about something with triumphant and often malicious satisfaction, gratification, or delight" (e.g., to gloat over an enemy's misfortune).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gloat "Dictionary definition of gloat"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827125609/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gloat |date=August 27, 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gloating is different from ''Schadenfreude'' in that it does not necessarily require malice (one may gloat to a friend about having defeated him in a game without ill intent), and that it describes an action rather than a state of mind (one typically gloats to the subject of the misfortune or to a third party). Also, unlike ''Schadenfreude'', where the focus is on another's misfortune, gloating often brings to mind inappropriately celebrating or bragging about one's own good fortune without any particular focus on the misfortune of others.

== Related emotions or concepts ==
Permutations of the concept of pleasure at another's unhappiness are: pleasure at another's happiness, displeasure at another's happiness, and displeasure at another's unhappiness. Words for these concepts are sometimes cited as [[antonym]]s to ''Schadenfreude'', as each is the [[opposite (semantics)|opposite]] in some way.

Pleasure at another's happiness is described by the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concept of ''[[mudita]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muditajournal.com/archives/000266.php ''The Upside of Shadenfreude''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413072532/http://www.muditajournal.com/archives/000266.php |date=April 13, 2016}}, Joshua Zader, Mudita Journal, December 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sirtumble.blogspot.com/2005/02/are-you-schadenfreude-or-mudita.html ''Are you Schadenfreude or Mudita?''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311235315/http://sirtumble.blogspot.com/2005/02/are-you-schadenfreude-or-mudita.html |date=March 11, 2016}}, Sirtumble, One of Six Billion..., February 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nell |first1=Regen |title=Regen |journal=Iowa City Public Library and the International Writing Program Panel Series |date=September 16, 2011 |url=https://iwp.uiowa.edu/sites/iwp/files/Regan_ICPL2011_0.pdf |accessdate=17 July 2017 |ref=https://iwp.uiowa.edu/ |series=The International Writing Program |publisher=University of Iowa}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the concept of "[[compersion]]" in the [[polyamory]] community.

Displeasure at another's happiness is involved in [[envy]], and perhaps in [[jealousy]]. The recent coinage "freudenschade" similarly means sorrow at another's success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/wwftd/message/1226 |title=Yahoo Groups "worthless word for the day is ... freudenschade" |publisher=Groups.yahoo.com |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080513182307/http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2006/4/28/freudenschade Daily Stanford (2006) "Freudenschade"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Displeasure at another's unhappiness is [[sympathy]], [[pity]], or [[compassion]].

"[[Sadistic personality disorder|Sadism]]" is pleasure derived from the ''infliction'' of pain, whereas schadenfreude is pleasure on ''observing'' misfortune and in particular the fact that the other somehow deserved the misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Ben-Ze'ev, "The personal comparative concern in schadenfreude" in Wilco W. can Dijk, Jaap W. Ouwerkerk, eds., ''Schadenfreude: Understanding Pleasure at the Misfortune of Others'', Cambridge 2014, {{ISBN|1107017505}}, p. 86''f''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neologisms and variants ==
[[Neologisms]] and [[portmanteau]] words were coined from the word as early as 1993, when Lincoln Caplan, in his book ''Skadden: Power, Money, and the Rise of a Legal Empire'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Latest activity 19 hours ago |title=Skadden: Power, Money, and the Rise of a Legal Empire (9780374524241): Lincoln Caplan: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |isbn=0374524246}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the word ''Skaddenfreude'' to describe the delight that competitors of [[Skadden Arps]] took in its troubles of the early 1990s. Others include ''spitzenfreude'', coined by ''[[The Economist]]'' to refer to the fall of [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal|Eliot Spitzer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10852872 |title=Premium content |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Schadenford'', coined by ''[[Toronto Life]]'' in regard to Canadian politician [[Rob Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=When the Ford jokes stop |author=Bartley Kives |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/columnists/when-the-ford-jokes-stop-208982891.html |newspaper=[[Winnipeg Free Press]] |date=26 May 2013 |accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary usage and philosophical analysis ==
The [[Book of Proverbs]] mentions an emotion similar to ''Schadenfreude'': "Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him." (Proverbs 24:17–18, [[King James Version]]).

In the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] used ''epikhairekakia'' (ἐπιχαιρεκακία in Greek) as part of a triad of terms, in which ''epikhairekakia'' stands as the opposite of ''[[phthonos]]'' (φθόνος), and ''[[Archenemy|nemesis]]'' (νέμεσις) occupies the mean. ''Nemesis'' is "a painful response to another's undeserved good fortune", while ''phthonos'' is a painful response to any good fortune, deserved or not. The ''epikhairekakos'' (ἐπιχαιρέκακος) person takes pleasure in another's ill fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pedrick |first=Victoria |authorlink= |author2=Oberhelman, Steven M. |year=2006 |title=The Soul of Tragedy: Essays on Athenian Drama |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-0-226-65306-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Page:The ethics of Aristotle.djvu/68|''Nicomachean Ethics'', 2.7.1108b1-10]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucretius]] characterises the emotion in an extended [[simile]] in ''[[De rerum natura]]'': ''Suave, mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis, e terra magnum alterius spectare laborem'', "It is pleasant to watch from the land the great struggle of someone else in a sea rendered great by turbulent winds." The abbreviated [[List of Latin phrases|Latin tag]] ''suave mare magno'' recalled the passage to generations familiar with the Latin classics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick O'Brian]]'s usage of the tag in his Aubrey-Maturin historical novels is reflected in Dean King's companion lexicon ''A Sea of Words'' (3rd ed.2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] regards "delight in the adversity of a neighbour" as one of the "daughters of envy ... which follows anger" in his ''Dialogue on Miracles''.&lt;ref&gt;''Dialogus miraculorum'', IV, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[17th century philosophy|17th century]], [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] wrote in his work ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'', "Out of these two [the concupiscible and irascible powers] arise those mixed affections and passions of [[anger]], which is a desire of revenge; hatred, which is inveterate anger; zeal, which is offended with him who hurts that he loves; and ἐπιχαιρεκακία, a compound affection of joy and hate, when we rejoice at other men's mischief, and are grieved at their prosperity; [[pride]], [[self-love]], emulation, envy, [[shame]], &amp;c., of which elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1621 |title=The Anatomy of Melancholy |author=Robert Burton |pages=t. 1, sect. 1, memb. 2, subsect. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] mentioned ''Schadenfreude'' as the most evil sin of human feeling, famously saying "To feel envy is human, to savor schadenfreude is diabolic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schopenhauer |first=Arthur |title=The Essays of Arthur Schopenhauer On Human Nature |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10739/pg10739.html |work=On Human Nature |quote=But it is ''Schadenfreude'', a mischievous delight in the misfortunes of others, which remains the worst trait in human nature. It is a feeling which is closely akin to cruelty, and differs from it, to say the truth, only as theory from practice.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Harold S. Kushner]] in his book ''[[When Bad Things Happen to Good People]]'' describes ''Schadenfreude'' as a universal, even wholesome reaction that cannot be helped. "There is a German psychological term, ''Schadenfreude'', which refers to the embarrassing reaction of relief we feel when something bad happens to someone else instead of to us." He gives examples and writes, "[People] don't wish their friends ill, but they can’t help feeling an embarrassing spasm of gratitude that [the bad thing] happened to someone else and not to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1981 |title=When Bad Things Happen to Good People |author=Harold S. Kushner |publisher=first published by Schocken Books |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Sontag]]'s book ''[[Regarding the Pain of Others]]'', published in 2003, is a study of the issue of how the pain and misfortune of some people affects others, namely whether [[war photography]] and [[War art|war paintings]] may be helpful as anti-war tools, or whether they only serve some sense of ''Schadenfreude'' in some viewers.

[[Philosopher]] and [[sociologist]] [[Theodor Adorno]] defined schadenfreude as "... largely unanticipated delight in the suffering of another, which is cognized as trivial and/or appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{cite book |author=Portmann, John |title=When bad things happen to other people |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-92335-2 |oclc= |doi= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific studies ==
A ''[[New York Times]]'' article in 2002 cited a number of scientific studies of ''Schadenfreude'', which it defined as "delighting in others' misfortune". Many such studies are based on [[social comparison theory]], the idea that when people around us have bad luck, we look better to ourselves. Other researchers have found that people with low [[self-esteem]] are more likely to feel ''Schadenfreude'' than are those who have high self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=St. John |first=Warren |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3D6153CF937A1575BC0A9649C8B63 |title=Sorrow So Sweet: A Guilty Pleasure in Another's Woe |newspaper=The New York Times |date=24 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study examined intergroup ''Schadenfreude'' within the context of sports, specifically an international football (soccer) competition. The study focused on the German and Dutch football teams and their fans. The results of this study indicated that the emotion of''Schadenfreude'' is very sensitive to circumstances that make it more or less legitimate to feel such malicious pleasure towards a sports rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leach |first=C. |author2=Spears, R. |author3=Branscombe, N. R. |author4=Doosje, B. |title=Malicious pleasure: Schadenfreude at the suffering of another group |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=2003 |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=932–943 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.5.932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study by Cikara and colleagues using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) examined ''Schadenfreude'' among [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[New York Yankees]] fans, and found that fans showed increased activation in brain areas correlated with self-reported pleasure ([[ventral striatum]]) when observing the rival team experience a negative outcome (e.g., a [[strikeout]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Us Versus Them Social Identity Shapes Neural Responses to Intergroup Competition and Harm |url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/3/306 |journal=Psychological Science |date=2011-03-01 |issn=0956-7976 |pmc=3833634 |pmid=21270447 |pages=306–313 |volume=22 |issue=3 |doi=10.1177/0956797610397667 |first=Mina |last=Cikara |first2=Matthew M. |last2=Botvinick |first3=Susan T. |last3=Fiske}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, fans exhibited increased activation in the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]] and insula when viewing their own team experience a negative outcome.

A 2006 experiment about justice served suggests that men, but not women, enjoy seeing "bad people" suffer. The study was designed to measure empathy, by watching which brain centers are stimulated when subjects observed via fMRI see someone experiencing physical [[pain]]. Researchers expected that the brain's empathy center of subjects would show more stimulation when those seen as "good" got an electric shock, than would occur if the shock was given to someone the subject had reason to consider "bad". This was indeed the case, but for male subjects, the brain's pleasure centers also lit up when someone got a shock that the male thought was "well-deserved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Singer T |author2=Seymour B |author3=O'Doherty JP |author4=Stephan KE |author5=Dolan RJ |author6=Frith CD |title=Empathic neural responses are modulated by the perceived fairness of others |journal=Nature |volume=439 |issue=7075 |pages=466–9 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16421576 |doi=10.1038/nature04271 |url= |pmc=2636868 |bibcode=2006Natur.439..466S}} [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/19/science/19revenge.html?ex=1139547600&amp;en=5cb415405edddd2e&amp;ei=5070l Lay-summary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416211358/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/19/science/19revenge.html?ex=1139547600&amp;en=5cb415405edddd2e&amp;ei=5070l |date=April 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brain-scanning studies show that ''Schadenfreude'' is correlated with envy in subjects. Strong feelings of envy activated physical pain nodes in the brain's dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]]; the brain's reward centers, such as the [[ventral striatum]], were activated by news that other people envied had suffered misfortune. The magnitude of the brain's ''Schadenfreude'' response could even be predicted from the strength of the previous envy response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/323/5916/937 |journal=Science |date=2009-02-13 |title=When Your Gain Is My Pain and Your Pain Is My Gain: Neural Correlates of Envy and Schadenfreude |doi=10.1126/science.1165604 |last1=Takahashi |first1=H. |last2=Kato |first2=M. |last3=Matsuura |first3=M. |last4=Mobbs |first4=D. |last5=Suhara |first5=T. |last6=Okubo |first6=Y. |volume=323 |issue=5916 |pages=937–9 |pmid=19213918 |bibcode=2009Sci...323..937T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/science/17angi.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=17 February 2009 |title=In Pain and Joy of Envy, the Brain May Play a Role |first=Natalie |last=Angier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in 2009 provides evidence for people's capacity to feel ''Schadenfreude'' in response to negative events in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Combs |first=D. J. Y.|author2=Powell, C. A. J. |author3=Schurtz, D. R. |author4=Smith, R. H. |title=Politics, schadenfreude, and ingroup identification: The sometimes happy things about a poor economy and death |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |year=2009 |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=635–646 |url=http://spp.sagepub.com/content/3/1/63.full.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2009.02.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was designed to determine whether or not there was a possibility that events containing objective misfortunes might produce ''Schadenfreude''. It was reported in the study that the likelihood of experiencing feelings of ''Schadenfreude'' depends upon whether an individual's own party or the opposing party is suffering harm. This study suggests that the domain of politics is prime territory for feelings of ''Schadenfreude'', especially for those who identify strongly with their political party.

A '''second-class citizen''' is a person who is systematically [[discrimination|discriminated]] against within a [[State (polity)|state]] or other [[Political division|political jurisdiction]], despite their nominal status as a citizen or legal resident there. While not necessarily [[slaves]], [[civil death|outlaws]] or [[criminals]], second-class citizens have limited legal rights, civil rights and socioeconomic opportunities, and are often subject to mistreatment or neglect at the hands of their putative superiors. However, they are different from "[[less-than-whole citizens]]",&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fragmented Citizens: The Changing Landscape of Gay and Lesbian Lives|last=Engel|first=Stephen|publisher=NYU Press|year=2016|isbn=1479809128|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as second-class citizens are often disregarded by the law or have it used to [[harassment|harass]] them (see [[police misconduct]] and [[racial profiling]]). Systems with ''[[de facto]]'' second-class citizenry are generally regarded as violating human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/second-class-citizen|title=the definition of second-class citizen|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/second-class%20citizen|title=Definition of SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical conditions facing second-class citizens include but are not limited to: 
* [[disenfranchisement]] (a lack or loss of voting rights) 
* limitations on [[civil service|civil]] or [[military]] service (not including [[conscription]] in every case) 
* restrictions on [[language]], [[religion]], [[education]] 
* lack of freedom of movement and association 
* limitations on weapons ownership 
* restrictions on [[marriage]] 
* restrictions on [[Gender Identity|gender identity and expression]] 
* restrictions on [[House|housing]]  
* restrictions on [[property|property ownership]]

The category is normally unofficial and mostly academic, and the term itself is generally used as a [[pejorative]] and governments will typically deny the existence of a second class within the [[polity]]. As an informal category, second-class citizenship is not objectively measured; however, cases such as the [[American South]] under [[Racial segregation|segregation]], [[Aboriginal Australians|aborigines]] in [[Australia]] prior to 1967, [[apartheid]] in [[Republic of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Women's rights in Saudi Arabia|women]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] under Saudi law, [[Dalit]]s in [[India]] and [[Nepal]], and [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] in [[Northern Ireland]] during the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|parliamentary]] era are all examples of groups that have been historically described as having second-class citizenry. Historically, before the mid-20th century, this policy was applied by some European [[Colonial empire|Colonial Empires]] on colonial [[Domicile (law)|residents]] of overseas holdings. 

A [[resident alien]] or [[foreign national]], and [[children]] in general, fit most definitions of second-class citizen. This does not mean that they do not have any legal protections, nor do they lack acceptance by the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/second-class-citizen|title=the definition of second-class citizen|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[naturalized]] citizen carries essentially the same rights and responsibilities as any other citizen (a possible exception being ineligibility for certain public offices), and is also legally protected.

* Proposals for a U.S. [[guest worker program]]&amp;mdash;which would provide legal status to and admit foreign workers to the U.S., but provide no path to citizenship for them&amp;mdash;has been criticized on the ground that such a policy would creating second-class non-citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/thats-hospitality |title=That's Hospitality &amp;#124; New Republic|magazine=[[The New Republic]]|date=April 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Conor Friedersdorf]], [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/01/reform-immigration-but-dont-create-second-class-non-citizens/267277/ Reform Immigration, but Don't Create Second-Class Non-Citizens], ''The Atlantic'' (January 17, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anna Stilz, [https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/Stilz_guestworker_0.pdf Guestworkers and second-class citizenship], ''Policy and Society'', Vol. 29, Issue 4 (November 2010), pp. 295–307.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|Latvian non-citizens]] constitute a group similar to second-class citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neurope.eu/article/walk-latvian|title='Walk like a Latvian'|publisher=New Europe|date=2013-06-01|accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are not considered foreigners (they hold no other citizenship, have Latvian IDs), they have reduced rights compared to full citizens. For example, non-citizens are not eligible to vote or hold public office. The [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] has described their status as making "people concerned feel like “second-class citizens”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.ecri.coe.int/XMLEcri/ENGLISH/Cycle_03/03_CbC_eng/LVA-CbC-III-2008-2-ENG.pdf Third report on Latvia.

* New Zealanders receive automatically a "[[Special Category Visa]]" upon entering Australia, which presents no pathway to Australian citizenship.  New Zealanders are denied access to [[Centrelink]], to name just one of the services.  This means that if, for example, a New Zealand person came to Australia to live with his or her Australian spouse, and that spouse committed domestic violence upon them, the New Zealander could not then turn to Centrelink to provide them with funds to leave the abusive spouse. 
* Mainland Chinese citizens who are settling in Hong Kong or Macau by means of a [[one-way permit]] do not have citizenship rights (such as obtaining a [[passport]]) in both the mainland or the SAR after settling but before obtaining the permanent resident status, effectively rendering them second-class citizens.
* [[Burakumin]] (部落民) is a designation of Japanese Second-class status meaning the people who are from a place called a "buraku." “Buraku” basically means a village or small district. For a long time, people have discriminated against people from a "buraku" even though they belong to the same [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and there are no differences between ordinary [[Japanese people|Japanese]] people and people who are called burakumin. It is not clear when and why this started, but it is said that it was most common in the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roth|first1=Louis Frédéric ; translated by Käthe|title=Japan encyclopedia|date=2005|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674017535|pages=93–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often called "eta" (穢多) or "[[hinin]]" (非人) meaning polluted or not a human.  Even though in [[Meiji 4]] (1871), this discrimination was officially ended by kaihourei ([[:ja:解放令|解放令]]), many people resisted it and continued treating them as burakumin.

{{refimprove|date=September 2017}}
A '''secret identity''' is a person's alter ego which is not known to the general populace, most often used in fiction. Brought into popular culture by [[the Scarlet Pimpernel]] in 1903, the concept is particularly prevalent in the [[American comic book]] genre, and is a more genre-specific version of the broader [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of the [[Masquerade (trope)|masquerade]].

In American comic books, a character typically has dual identities, with one identity being the [[superhero]] persona and the other being the secret identity. The secret identity is typically the superhero's civilian persona when they are not assuming the superhero persona. It is kept hidden from their enemies and the general public to protect themselves from legal ramifications, pressure, or public scrutiny, as well as to protect their friends and loved ones from harm secondary to their actions as superheroes.

The secret identity commonly consists of the superhero's given birth name and may involve an occupation they had before becoming a superhero. This is in contrast to the superhero identity, which often utilizes a [[pseudonym]] and sometimes a mask to complete a costume to conceal the superhero's secret identity. To help further preserve the anonymity of secret identities, characters may use eyeglasses, particular clothing, or display a different set of personal characteristics when assuming the secret identity persona. For example, the superhero [[Batman]]'s secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a billionaire who is known to the public for his affluent playboy lifestyle. Another example is [[Superman]], who does not wear a mask when he is in costume, but wears eyeglasses and appears mild-mannered when he assumes his secret identity of Clark Kent.

Types of characters that may have secret identities include heroes, [[superhero]]es, [[thief|thieves]], [[villain]]s, [[supervillain]]s, [[vigilante]]s, [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]]s, and "[[monster]]s". A character may have several secret identities simultaneously, such as adopted names or [[undercover]] identities.

==History==

Myth and legend is filled with stories of gods or heroes who took on other identities for various purposes.  A significant precursor to the 20th century concept of a secret identity in fiction is ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' (1844) by [[Alexandre Dumas]], a huguely popular story which was frequently dramatized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  In this story, the protagonist Edmund Dantes takes on the identity of the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo in order to carry out his plan of revenge against the men who were responsible for his downfall and imprisonment.

Art by [[Brian Bolland]].]]
The modern popular culture use of secret identities begins in the early 20th century with characters such as [[the Scarlet Pimpernel]] (1903), [[Jimmie_Dale|Jimmie Dale, the Gray Seal]] (1914), [[Zorro]] (1919), and the [[Lone Ranger]] (1933). A line in the novel ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' reads, "Because the Scarlet Pimpernel works in the dark, and his identity is only known under the solemn oath of secrecy to his immediate followers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orczy|first1=Baroness|title=the Scarlet Pimpernel - CHAPTER IV THE LEAGUE OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL|date=2005|publisher=Hodder|location=London|isbn=0340894989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scarlet Pimpernel is the name of a chivalrous Englishman, Sir Percy Blakeney, who exhibits characteristics that would become standard superhero conventions, including the penchant for disguise, use of a signature weapon (sword), ability to out-think and outwit his adversaries, and a calling card (he leaves behind a [[Anagallis arvensis|scarlet pimpernel]] at each of his interventions).&lt;ref name="Robb"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robb|first1=Brian J.|title=A Brief History of Superheroes: From Superman to the Avengers, the Evolution of Comic Book Legends|date=2014|publisher=Hatchet UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; By drawing attention to his alter ego Blakeney he hides behind his public face as a slow thinking foppish playboy (like [[Bruce Wayne]]), and he also establishes a network of supporters, The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, that aid his endeavours.&lt;ref name="Robb"/&gt;

Starting in the 1930s, the concept of crime-fighters, [[superhero]]es, and [[vigilante]]s (and their adversaries) adopting secret identities became more widespread in [[dime novel]]s, [[pulp magazine]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[old-time radio|old-time]] [[radio drama]]s, [[Serial (film)|movie serials]], and other [[popular fiction]] and such characters remain popular to this day.  Superman appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' in 1938 as one of the forerunners amongst a [[list of superhero debuts]].

==Purpose==

The artistic purpose of the secret identity on the part of the writers is that it allows the characters to have ordinary lives, which can allow for human drama as well as create [[suspense|tension]] with the effort needed to preserve the secret.  This can include challenges such as throwing off the suspicions of associates who suspect, and the need to quickly improvise means to get out of sight to change identities.  And [[superhuman]] characters may benefit from an [[everyman]] aspect through having a secret identity, giving them a [[sympathy|sympathetic]] link to their audience.  For example, [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'s secret identity is a boy named Billy Batson - a deliberate attempt to play on the daydreams of a young readership.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Some common [[motivation]]s for a character to keep a secret identity include:
*Allowing the character to live a "normal life" when not fighting crime.
*Preventing the hero's enemies from seeking revenge on others the hero may care about.
*Giving the hero an advantage in crime fighting (e.g. Batman or [[The Shadow]] striking fear into criminals).
*Gaining timely information on incidents as they happen, often through their occupation or that of their associates (e.g. a [[reporter]] or a [[newscaster]] would likely be more informed about incidents that a hero might be able to help with).
*Gaining information on criminal investigations or on crimes being planned (e.g., in his early days as Batman, Bruce Wayne would learn about ongoing investigations from [[Commissioner Jim Gordon|Commissioner Gordon]], while [[Plastic Man]]'s alter ego, criminal Eel O'Brien, would go along on other crimes, only to capture his cohorts as Plastic Man).
*[[Fictional extraterrestrials|Aliens]], upon coming to Earth, may choose to set up one or more secret identities as a ''learning tool''. By pretending to be humans, they can explore the different roles and lives that a regular human is expected to have in his/her life and using their deeper understanding of human condition to help others.
*To avoid legal ramifications or public scrutiny due to accountability with the collateral damage superheroes are often involved with, which carries the risk of imprisonment or becoming a public [[Outcast (person)|pariah]] such as from being branded as a [[vigilante]]. Villains such as the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] also use this reason to hide their unlawful actions to protect their social standing.
*To allow the public to admire their super alter-ego as its own entity, not weakened by the mortality of their "normal" counterpart.

==The question of genuine identity==

Sometimes the distinction as to which persona is the "real one" may be blurred or confused, as has sometimes been the case with [[Clark Kent]] and [[Superman]]. In the earliest Superman comics, Clark's primary purpose was to fulfill the perceived requirement that a superhero cannot remain on full duty all the time and Clark thus acted as little more than a front for Superman's activities.  In the television series ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', after [[Lois Lane]] learns that Superman is Clark Kent, he discusses his dual identity with her. "Clark Kent is not a disguise. Clark is who I am, while Superman is what I do."  

The compromises that Clark still needed to make to secure his alter-egos were limited as the [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Pa Kent]] of the ''Man of Steel'' comics enthusiastically explains: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;"SEE MA? WITH HIS HAIR ALL SLICKERED BACK AND AN OLD PAIR OF MY SPECTACLES, HIS WHOLE FACE SEEMS TO CHANGE.  ALL HE NEEDS TO DO IS '''''STOOP''''' A TAD AND HE LOOKS LIKE A WHOLE DIFFERENT MAN.  AND SO LONG AS HE'S CAREFUL NEVER TO LET ON THAT HE '''''HAS''''' TWO SEPARATE IDENTITIES, HE'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE FREELY LIKE ORDINARY FOLKS!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man of Steel #1, Chapter2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beyond stooping, Clark develops a tendency of avoiding conflict.  Sometimes this is in order to allow him to change into his alter ego. while at other times it is to maintain a consistently non-Superman type image. In either case, it opens the "mild mannered" reporter to the [[Social stigma|stigma]] of cowardice and weakness. Superman's face remains uncovered on the justification that he wants to be trusted by people while [[Batman]] wears a mask partly because he wants to be feared by criminals.  It has also been suggested that [[Bruce Wayne]] is "the mask" that Batman wears, meaning that Batman is the true persona, hidden by his public image.

Heroes in this type of situation are known to find their love interests developing interests in and even infatuations for their heroic personas, as a dual identity can have an influence on romantic attraction. Lois Lane found herself attracted to Superman but is fairly indifferent towards Clark Kent and for years bore some resentment towards him. Similarly, [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] was madly in love with [[Spider-Man]] but was utterly replused by his revelation as Peter Parker, which eventually led to their break-up. Following a reset that [[Mindwipe|erased her memory]] of his secret identity, Black Cat and Spider-Man have a strictly "masks-on" relationship whenever they engage in [[On-again, off-again relationship|on-again, off-again]] romance.

Characters who experience an actual transformation when changing from one persona may have two relatively genuine identities, albeit with additional possibilities of inner conflict.  An example of this is Dr. Robert Bruce Banner who needs to seek genuine calmness in order to prevent transforming into the genuinely raging [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Other characters have abilities that help them conceal their identities such as: [[shapeshifting]] or [[mind control]].  For instance Marvel's [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] has an unaltered form with features including blue skin and yellow eyes and yet she has shape shifting and vocal mimicry abilities give her the potential to fit into any required situation. At another extreme characters like [[He-Man]] manage to maintain their secret identities with a change of clothes and a [[Sun Tanning|tan]].

Some characters initially maintain secret identities but discard of them over time. [[Tony Stark]] at first told the news media and general public that [[Iron Man]] is his personal [[Bodyguard|bodyguard]] and corporate [[Mascot|mascot]] before he eventually publicly reveals his dual identity. Other characters miss the opportunity to conceal their identities or choose to be public from the very beginning. For instance, the [[Fantastic Four]], who would have always had difficulties concealing [[The Thing (comics)|the Thing]], have typically maintained a public appearance from the [[Manhattan]] based [[Baxter Building]]. Much like Iron Man, the members of the Fantastic Four have few surviving civilian relatives and most of their friends and loved ones have [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman abilities]] they can use to protect themselves from harm.

==Keeping the secret==

Unless an identity is itself well known, its discovery may not jeopardize the person's safety. For example, the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "The Great Brain Robbery" features [[Lex Luthor]] temporarily [[body swap]]ping with the Flash ([[Wally West]]). When Luthor tries to learn the hero's secret identity by taking off his mask and looking in a mirror, he realizes that he has "no idea who this is".&lt;ref name="sava20150112"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/justice-league-unlimited-great-brain-robbery-213725 | title=Justice League Unlimited: “The Great Brain Robbery” | publisher=AV Club | date=2015-01-12 | accessdate=20 April 2016 | author=Sava, Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt; If secret identities are to remain secret then others must fail to recognize and subsequently publicize that personas of a character belong to the same person.  Identities may be kept secret in a number of ways including: 
*[[Shapeshifting|actual physical change]]&lt;ref name="hulk"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hulk: The Incredible Guide|last1=DeFalco|first1=Tom|date=5 May 2003|publisher=DK Publishing|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The application of elements of [[disguise]] on the various personas of the character 
*Becoming or remaining less visible due to: [[camouflage]], [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]], [[invisibility]] or [[vibration]] 
*the adoption of different mannerisms and vocal characteristics by the various personas of the character
*[[Toxicology|Chemical influences]], [[hypnosis]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[telepathy|telepathic]]/psychic influences
*The causation of [[Wound|physical damage]] with the result of [[Mental disorder|impaired mental ability]], [[Communication|impaired communicative ability]] or [[death]].
*Public appearances of both identities in the same area with the cooperation of a friend in disguise, or an [[android (robot)|android]] made to take that appearance, by some form of illusion or by such means as time travel.
*Does not display any of their special skills in public. (ex. Bruce Wayne not displaying his martial arts skills in public to protect his secret identity as Batman&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' (vol. 2) #2 (December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Has special abilities that help prevent from being observed changing identities, such as [[Spider-Man]]'s spider-sense, that senses when he is in danger, which registers unwanted observers at such moments as a threat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9452">In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical computer science]], a '''semiautomaton''' is a [[deterministic finite automaton]] having inputs but no output. It consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''Q'' of [[state (computer science)|states]], a set Σ called the input alphabet, and a function ''T'': ''Q'' × Σ → ''Q'' called the transition function.

Associated with any semiautomaton is a [[monoid]] called the '''characteristic monoid''', '''input monoid''', '''transition monoid''' or '''transition system''' of the semiautomaton, which [[monoid action|acts]] on the set of states ''Q''. This may be viewed either as an action of the [[free monoid]] of [[string (computer science)|strings]] in the input alphabet Σ, or as the induced [[transformation semigroup]] of ''Q''.

In older books like Clifford and Preston (1967) [[Semigroup action#Formal definitions|S-acts]] are called "operands".

In [[category theory]], semiautomata essentially are [[functor]]s.

==Transformation semigroups and monoid acts==

: {{main|semigroup action}}

A '''transformation semigroup''' or '''transformation monoid''' is a pair &lt;math&gt;(M,Q)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''Q'' (often called the "set of [[state (computer science)|states]]") and a [[semigroup]] or [[monoid]] ''M'' of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or "transformations", mapping ''Q'' to itself. They are functions in the sense that every element ''m'' of ''M'' is a map &lt;math&gt;m\colon Q\to Q&lt;/math&gt;. If ''s'' and ''t'' are two functions of the transformation semigroup, their semigroup product is defined as their [[function composition]] &lt;math&gt;(st)(q)=(s\circ t)(q)=s(t(q))&lt;/math&gt;.

Some authors regard "semigroup" and "monoid" as synonyms. Here a semigroup need not have an [[identity element]]; a monoid is a semigroup with an identity element (also called "unit"). Since the notion of functions acting on a set always includes the notion of an identity function, which when applied to the set does nothing, a transformation semigroup can be made into a monoid by adding the identity function.

===''M''-acts===

Let ''M'' be a [[monoid]] and ''Q'' be a non-empty set. If there exists a multiplicative operation

:&lt;math&gt;\mu\colon Q\times M \to Q&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(q,m)\mapsto qm=\mu(q,m)&lt;/math&gt;

which satisfies the properties

:&lt;math&gt;q1=q&lt;/math&gt;

for 1 the unit of the monoid, and 
:&lt;math&gt;q(st)=(qs)t&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;q\in Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s,t\in M&lt;/math&gt;, then the triple &lt;math&gt;(Q,M,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''right ''M''-act''' or simply a '''right act'''. In long-hand, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the ''right multiplication of elements of Q by elements of M''. The right act is often written as &lt;math&gt;Q_M&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''left act''' is defined similarly, with

:&lt;math&gt;\mu\colon M\times Q \to Q&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(m,q)\mapsto mq=\mu(m,q)&lt;/math&gt;

and is often denoted as &lt;math&gt;\,_MQ&lt;/math&gt;.

An ''M''-act is closely related to a transformation monoid. However the elements of ''M'' need not be functions ''per se'', they are just elements of some monoid. Therefore, one must demand that the action of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; be consistent with multiplication in the monoid (''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;\mu(q, st)=\mu(\mu(q,s),t)&lt;/math&gt;), as, in general, this might not hold for some arbitrary &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, in the way that it does for function composition.

Once one makes this demand, it is completely safe to drop all parenthesis, as the monoid product and the action of the monoid on the set are completely [[associative]].  In particular, this allows elements of the monoid to be represented as [[String (computer science)|strings]] of letters, in the computer-science sense of the word "string". This abstraction then allows one to talk about [[string operation]]s in general, and eventually leads to the concept of [[formal languages]] as being composed of strings of letters.

Another difference between an ''M''-act and a transformation monoid is that for an ''M''-act ''Q'', two distinct elements of the monoid may determine the same transformation of ''Q''. If we demand that this does not happen, then an ''M''-act is essentially the same as a transformation monoid.

===M-homomorphism===

For two ''M''-acts &lt;math&gt;Q_M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_M&lt;/math&gt; sharing the same monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, an '''''M''-homomorphism''' &lt;math&gt;f\colon Q_M\to B_M&lt;/math&gt; is a map &lt;math&gt;f\colon Q \to B &lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(qm)=f(q)m&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;q\in Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\in M&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of all ''M''-homomorphisms is commonly written as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}(Q_M, B_M)&lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}_M(Q, B)&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''M''-acts and ''M''-homomorphisms together form a [[category (mathematics)|category]] called '''''M''-Act'''.

==Semiautomata==

A '''semiautomaton''' is a triple &lt;math&gt;(Q,\Sigma,T)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty set, called the ''input alphabet'', ''Q'' is a non-empty set, called the ''set of states'', and ''T'' is the ''transition function''

:&lt;math&gt;T\colon Q\times \Sigma \to Q.&lt;/math&gt;

When the set of states ''Q'' is a finite set—it need not be—, a semiautomaton may be thought of as a [[deterministic finite automaton]] &lt;math&gt;(Q,\Sigma,T,q_0,A)&lt;/math&gt;, but without the initial state &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt; or set of [[accept state]]s ''A''. Alternately, it is a [[finite state machine]] which has no output, and only an input.

Any semiautomaton induces an act of a monoid in the following way.

Let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; be the [[free monoid]] generated by the [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; (so that the superscript * is understood to be the [[Kleene star]]); it is the set of all finite-length [[string (computer science)|strings]] composed of the letters in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

For every word ''w'' in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;T_w\colon Q\to Q&lt;/math&gt; be the function, defined recursively, as follows, for all ''q'' in ''Q'':

* If &lt;math&gt;w=\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T_\varepsilon(q)=q&lt;/math&gt;, so that the [[empty word]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; does not change the state.
* If &lt;math&gt;w=\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a letter in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T_\sigma(q)=T(q,\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;w=\sigma v&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v\in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T_w(q)=T_v(T_\sigma(q))&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;M(Q,\Sigma,T)&lt;/math&gt; be the set

:&lt;math&gt;M(Q,\Sigma,T)=\{T_w \vert w\in\Sigma^* \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The set &lt;math&gt;M(Q,\Sigma,T)&lt;/math&gt; is closed under [[function composition]]; that is, for all &lt;math&gt;v,w\in\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, one has &lt;math&gt;T_w\circ T_v=T_{vw}&lt;/math&gt;. It also contains &lt;math&gt;T_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[identity function]] on ''Q''. Since function composition is [[associative]], the set &lt;math&gt;M(Q,\Sigma,T)&lt;/math&gt; is a monoid: it is called the '''input monoid''', '''characteristic monoid''', '''characteristic semigroup''' or '''transition monoid''' of the semiautomaton &lt;math&gt;(Q,\Sigma,T)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==

If the set of states ''Q'' is finite, then the transition functions are commonly represented as [[state transition table]]s.  The construction of all possible transitions driven by strings in the free group has a graphical depiction as [[de Bruijn graph]]s.{{clarify|reason=(1) No 'free group' was mentioned before; probably, the free monoid of all strings is meant instead? (2) The construction of transitions appears to be a process, so how can it have a 'depiction as ... graphs'?|date=April 2014}}

The set of states ''Q'' need not be finite, or even countable. As an example, semiautomata underpin the concept of [[quantum finite automata]]. There, the set of states ''Q'' are given by the [[complex projective space]]  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}P^n&lt;/math&gt;, and individual states are referred to as ''n''-state [[qubit]]s. State transitions are given by [[unitary matrix|unitary ''n''&amp;times;''n'' matrices]].  The input alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; remains finite, and other typical concerns of automata theory remain in play.  Thus, the '''quantum semiautomaton''' may be simply defined as the triple &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{C}P^n,\Sigma,\{U_{\sigma_1},U_{\sigma_2},\dotsc,U_{\sigma_p},\})&lt;/math&gt; when the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; has ''p'' letters, so that there is one unitary matrix &lt;math&gt;U_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; for each letter &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Stated in this way, the quantum semiautomaton has many geometrical generalizations. Thus, for example, one may take a [[Riemannian symmetric space]] in place of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}P^n&lt;/math&gt;, and selections from its group of isometries as transition functions.

The [[syntactic monoid]] of a [[formal language]] is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the transition monoid of the [[minimal automaton]] accepting the language.

{{about|the Greek virtue|the asteroid|134 Sophrosyne}}
'''Sophrosyne''' ({{lang-el|σωφροσύνη}}) is an ancient Greek concept of an ideal of excellence of character and soundness of mind, which when combined in one well-balanced individual leads to other qualities, such as temperance, moderation, prudence, purity, decorum and self-control. In other languages there is no equivalent word.

==Ancient Greek Literature==

In Greek literature sophrosyne is considered an important quality, and is sometimes expressed in opposition to the concept of [[hubris]].  A noted example of this occurs in Homer's ''[[The Iliad]]''. When [[Agamemnon]] decides to take the queen, [[Briseis]], away from [[Achilles]], it is seen as Agamemnon behaving with hubris and lacking sophrosyne.&lt;ref&gt;North, Helen. ''Sophrosyne: Self-knowledge and Self-restraint in Greek Literature''. ''Cornell studies in classical philology''.  Volume 35, issue 67, Issue 67. [[Cornell University Press]] (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Odysseus]] avoids being turned by [[Circe]] the enchantress into an animal by means of a magical herb, [[Moly_(herb)|moly]] (symbolizing, by some accounts, sophrosyne), given to him by [[Athena]] (Wisdom) and [[Hermes]] (Reason). 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bruce|last=Clarke|title=Allegories of Writing: The Subject of Metamorphosis|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany|year=1995|isbn=9780791426234}} p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heraclitus]]'s fragment 112 states: "Sophrosyne is the greatest virtue, and wisdom is speaking and acting the trust, paying heed to the nature of things." (σωφρονεῖν ἀρετὴ μεγίστη, καὶ σοφίη ἀληθέα λέγειν καὶ ποιεῖν κατὰ φύσιν ἐπαίοντας.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Drew Hyland|Hyland, D. A.]], ''Plato and the Question of Beauty'' ([[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] &amp; [[Indianapolis]]: [[Indiana University Press]], 2008), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=C1LaszjLNawC&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 105].&lt;/ref&gt;

Themes connected with ''sophrosyne'' and hubris figure prominently in plays of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]; ''sophrosyne'' is recognized as a virtue, although debased forms like prudery are criticized.  
&lt;ref&gt;North, Helen F. “A Period of Opposition to Sôphrosynê in Greek Thought.” ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'', vol. 78, 1947, pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Sophrosyne is a theme in the play ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'' by [[Euripides]], where sophrosyne is represented by the goddess [[Artemis]] and is personified by the character [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]].&lt;ref&gt;Euripides. ''Hippolytus''.  [[Robert Bagg|Bagg, Robert]]. Introduction. [[Oxford University Press]]. 1973 {{ISBN|978-0-19-507290-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plato==

Sophrosyne is an important topic for [[Plato]].  It is main subject of the dialogue [[Charmides_(dialogue)|''Charmides'']], wherein several definitions are proposed but no conclusion reached; however the dramatic context connotes moral purity and innocence. An etymological meaning of sophrosyne as "moral sanity" is proposed in [[Cratylus_(dialogue) |''Cratylus'']] 411e. Plato's view of sophrosyne is related to Pythagorean ''harmonia'' ([[Republic_(Plato)|''Republic'']] 430e−432a, 442c) and closely linked with Plato’s 
[[Plato%27s_tripartite_theory_of_soul|tripartite division]] of the soul: ''sophrosyne'' is the harmonious moderation of the appetitive and spirited parts of the soul by the rational part (e.g., [[Phaedrus_(dialogue)|''Phaedrus'']] 237c−238e).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Francis E.|last=Peters|title=Greek Philosophical Terms: A Historical Lexicon|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|year=1967|isbn=9780814765524}} p. 179. &lt;/ref&gt;

==After Plato==

For the Stoic, [[Zeno of Citium]], ''sophrosyne'' is one of the four chief virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, ''Greek Philosophical Terms'', p. l80.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Stoics like [[Musonius Rufus]], [[Seneca the younger|Seneca]], [[Epictetus]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]] took a practical view of ''sophrosyne'' and share a definition of it as the restraint of the appetites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Helen|last=North|title=Sophrosyne: Self-Knowledge and Self-Restraint in Greek Literature|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|year=1966|isbn=9780801403187}} pp. 228−229.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Demophilus, a Pythagorean philosopher of uncertain date, wrote: "the vigor of the soul is sophrosyne, the light of a soul free of disturbing passions." (Ρώμη ψυχής σωφροσύνη αύτη γαρ ψυχής απαθούς φώς εστιν.)&lt;ref&gt;''Sentences of Demophilus'' 39 = [[Stobaeus]], ''Florilegium'', vol. 1. Leipzig: Teubner, 1855, p. 117 (Peri Sophrosyne 42).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cicero]] considered four Latin terms to translate ''sophrosyne'': ''temperantia'' ([[Temperance_(virtue)|temperance]]), ''moderatio'' (moderateness), ''modestia'' (modesty) and ''frugalitas'' (frugality).&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'' 3.8.16.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the writings of [[Lactantius]], [[Ambrose|St. Ambrose]] and [[Augustine|St. Augustine]], the virtue's meaning as temperance or "proper mixture" became the dominant view in subsequent Western European thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=M. F.|last=Carr|title=Passionate Deliberation: Emotion, Temperance, and the Care Ethic in Clinical Moral Deliberation|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|location=Berlin|year=2012|isbn=9789401005913}} p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sophrosyne is one of the [[Cardinal_virtues|cardinal virtues]].

An adjectival form is "sophron".&lt;ref&gt;Euripides. ''Hippolytos''. Oxford University Press. (1973) 978-0-19-507290-7 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Kindness Offensive''' ('''TKO''') is a group based in [[London]] known for orchestrating large-scale [[random acts of kindness]], involving the distribution of industrial quantities of goods to unsuspecting members of the public and charities. The group's stated purpose is to "Practice random kindness and senseless acts of beauty", a phrase first coined by [[Anne Herbert (writer)|Anne Herbert]].

==History==
The Kindness Offensive was formed in August 2008, when three of the four founding members (David Goodfellow, Benny Crane and James Hunter) asked members of the public in [[Hampstead]] what "[[random acts of kindness]]" they would like done for them. They received many requests from the public, and the group attempted to meet some of them by contacting companies and persuading them to donate the required goods for free, a technique developed by fourth founding member Robert Williams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jochan Embley |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/independent-on-sundays-happy-list-2014-not-the-rich-list-robert-williams-kindness-giver-9430850.html |title=Independent on Sunday's Happy List 2014 (NOT the Rich List): Robert Williams, kindness giver - News - People |publisher=The Independent |date=2014-05-25 |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to by the group as "phone whispering".

TKO attracted press attention in October 2008 for giving away twenty-five tonnes of non-perishable foods to fourteen soup kitchens and drop-in centres across London England; the event came to be known as 'The Mountain of Food'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7657122.stm |title=England &amp;#124; 'Kindness offensive' begins |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-10-07 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was the first of many large-scale events centred on distributing industrial quantities of goods in short periods of time to a wide variety of locations and causes; the most notable of these were The Vinspired Kindness Offensive (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7796092.stm |title=England &amp;#124; Hampers at the ready |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuOa8kQDud0 |title=An act of kindness |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White Stuff Kindness Offensive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4ZJcmFCKfY |title=A festive kindness offensive |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-12-22 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was widely reported as a record-breaking event (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHuWuOqYYC4 |title=A hundred volunteers &amp; ONE dog |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barclaycard Kindness Offensive (2011) the Hasbro Kindness Offensive (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvB-6nIyItk |title=Kids show true Christmas spirit |publisher=YouTube |date=2013-12-16 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Read Free!

As well as large giveaways, TKO has also staged a series of pop-up events, including The Everyday Kindness Awards in 2009. Over the course of a weekend, actors in public places pretended to need help, and when members of the public stepped up to offer a hand, they received a pop-up celebration rewarding their kindness with champagne, flowers and a gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8201806.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; London &amp;#124; Project rewards acts of kindness |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8667">'''''The personal is political''''', also termed '''''The private is political''''', is a political argument used as a rallying slogan of [[student movement]] and [[second-wave feminism]] from the late 1960s. It underscored the connections between personal experience and larger social and political structures. In the context of the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s, it was a challenge to the [[nuclear family]] and [[family values]].&lt;ref name="Harutyunyan2009p50"&gt;Angela Harutyunyan, Kathrin Hörschelmann, Malcolm Miles (2009) ''Public Spheres After Socialism'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=4tSjNwjax4YC&amp;pg=PA50 pp. 50–1.]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has been repeatedly described as a defining characterization of second-wave feminism, [[radical feminism]], [[women's studies]], or feminism in general.&lt;ref&gt;"The great thrust of radical feminist writing has been directed to the documentation of the slogan 'the personal is political.'" {{Cite book | publisher = Routledge | last = McCann | first = Carole |author2=Seung-Kyung Kim  | title = Feminist theory reader: Local and global perspectives | location = London | date = 2013 | page =191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"At the heart of Women's Studies and framing the perspective from which it proceeds was the critical insight that 'the personal is political.'" {{Cite book | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | isbn = 9780230605794 | last = Ginsberg | first = Alice E | title = The evolution of American women's studies: reflections on triumphs, controversies, and change | location = New York | date = 2008 | page = 69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was popularized by the publication of a 1969 essay by feminist [[Carol Hanisch]] under the title "The Personal is Political" in 1970,&lt;ref name="Smith2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Dale M.|title=Poets Beyond the Barricade: Rhetoric, Citizenship, and Dissent after 1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUNq2Ni019wC&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=August 1, 2012|date=2012-01-15|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=9780817317492|pages=153–}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she disavows authorship of the phrase. According to Kerry Burch, [[Shulamith Firestone]], [[Robin Morgan]], and other feminists given credit for originating the phrase have also declined authorship. "Instead," Burch writes, "they cite millions of women in public and private conversations as the phrase's collective authors."&lt;ref name=Burch139&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Continuum | isbn = 9781441112132 | last = Burch | first = Kerry T. | title = Democratic transformations: Eight conflicts in the negotiation of American identity | location = London | date = 2012 | page = 139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gloria Steinem]] has likened claiming authorship of the phrase to claiming authorship of "World War II."&lt;ref name=Burch139 /&gt;

The phrase figured in women-of-color feminism, such as "A Black Feminist Statement" by the [[Combahee River Collective]], [[Audre Lorde]]'s essay "The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House", and the anthology ''[[This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color]]'', edited by [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa]] and [[Cherríe Moraga]]. More broadly, as [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw]] observes: "This process of recognizing as social and systemic what was formerly perceived as isolated and individual has also characterized the [[identity politics]] of African Americans, other people of color, and gays and lesbians, among others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1229039 | issn = 0038-9765 | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 1241–1299 | last = Crenshaw | first = Kimberle | title = Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color | journal = Stanford Law Review | date = 1991-07-01 | jstor = 1229039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Carol Hanisch essay==
[[File:Notes_from_the_Second_Year_cover,_New_York_Radical_Women.jpg|thumb|right|The essay first appeared under the title "The Personal is Political" in ''Notes from the Second Year: Women's Liberation'' (1970).]]
Carol Hanisch, a member of [[New York Radical Women]] and a prominent figure in the [[Women's Liberation Movement]], drafted an article defending the political importance of [[consciousness-raising groups]] in February 1969 in Gainesville, Florida.&lt;ref name=Hanisch2006&gt;{{Cite web | last = Hanisch | first = Carol | title = The Personal Is Political: The Women's Liberation Movement classic with a new explanatory introduction | accessdate = 2014-09-07 | date = January 2006| url = http://www.carolhanisch.org/CHwritings/PIP.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally addressed to the women's caucus of the Southern Conference Educational Fund, the paper was first given the title, "Some Thoughts in Response to Dottie [Zellner]'s Thoughts on a Women's Liberation Movement". Hanisch was then a New York City-based staffer of the Fund and was advocating for it to engage in dedicated organizing for women's liberation in the American South.&lt;ref name=Hanisch2006 /&gt; Hanisch sought to rebut the idea that sex, appearance, abortion, childcare, and the division of household labor were merely personal issues without political importance. To confront these and other issues, she urged women to overcome self-blame, discuss their situations amongst each other, and organize collectively against male domination of society.&lt;ref name=Hanisch2006 /&gt; Hanisch does not use the phrase "the personal is political" in the essay, but writes:
:One of the first things we discover in these groups is that personal problems are political problems. There are no personal solutions at this time. There is only collective action for a collective solution.&lt;ref name=Hanisch2006 /&gt;
The essay was published under the title, "The Personal Is Political", in ''Notes from the Second Year: Women's Liberation'' in 1970. The essay's author believes that [[Shulamith Firestone]] and [[Anne Koedt]], the book's editors, gave the essay its famous title.&lt;ref name=Hanisch2006 /&gt; It has since been reprinted in ''Radical Feminism: A Documentary Reader''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = NYU Press | isbn = 0814715559 | others = Barbara A. Crow (ed.) | title = Radical feminism: A documentary reader | location = New York | date = 2000 | pages = 113–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiple meanings==
While the connection between women's personal experience and their subordination as women is highlighted by this phrase, feminists have interpreted the nature of that connection and the desired form of political action that emerges from it in widely divergent ways.

* An opening of "private" or "social" matters to political analysis and discussion.
* An explanation of the systematic nature of women's oppression. As summarized by Heidi Hartmann, "Women's discontent, radical feminists argued, is not the neurotic lament of the maladjusted, but a response to a social structure in which women are systematically dominated, exploited, and oppressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 9780415917612 | editors = Linda J. Nicholson (ed.) | last = Hartmann | first = Heidi | title = The Second Wave: A Reader in Feminist Theory | chapter = The unhappy marriage of Marxism and feminism: Towards a more progressive union | location = New York | date = 1997 | page = 100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paula Rust compiled a list of interpretations of the phrase within feminist movements including the following: "The personal reflects the political status quo (with the implication that the personal should be examined to provide insight into the political); the personal serves the political status quo; one can make personal choices in response to or protest against the political status quo; ... one's personal choices reveal or reflect one's personal politics; one should make personal choices that are consistent with one's personal politics; personal life and personal politics are indistinguishable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = New York University Press | isbn =  9780814774441  | last = Rust | first = Paula C. | title = Bisexuality and the challenge to lesbian politics: Sex, loyalty, and revolution | location = New York | date = 1995 | page=329n21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2006, Hanisch observed, "Like most of the theory created by the [[Redstockings#Ideology|Pro-Woman Line radical feminists]], these ideas have been revised or ripped off or even stood on their head and used against their original, radical intent."&lt;ref name=Hanisch2006 /&gt;

==16th to 18th century==
Beginning in 1539 with Art. 111 of the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/villers-cotterets.asp Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêt]&lt;/ref&gt; non-French languages in France were reduced in stature when it became compulsory "to deliver and execute all [legal] acts in the French language" (''de prononcer et expedier tous actes en langaige françoys''). Originally meant as a way to eliminate [[Latin]] in official documents — few 16th-century French subjects were educated and familiar with Latin — it also stated that French and only French was legal in the kingdom (''en langage maternel françoys et non aultrement'').

==Late 18th to late 19th century==
===Abbé Grégoire's "Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois"===
The deliberate process of eradicating non-French [[vernacular]]s in modern France and disparaging them as mere local and often strictly oral dialects was formalized with [[Henri Grégoire]]'s ''Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalise the use of the French language'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.languefrancaise.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=66 |title=Abbé Grégoire's ''Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalize the use of the French language'' |access-date=2008-04-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405022802/http://www.languefrancaise.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=66 |archive-date=2008-04-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which he presented on June 4, 1794 to the [[National Convention]]; thereafter, all languages other than French were officially banned in the administration and schools for the sake of [[linguistics|linguistically]] uniting post-[[Bastille Day]] France. At the time, only one tenth of the population were fluent in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gwalarn.org/brezhoneg/istor/gregoire.html |title=L'Abbé Grégoire en guerre contre les "Patois", Hervé Luxardo, gwalarn.org |access-date=2007-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609025249/http://www.gwalarn.org/brezhoneg/istor/gregoire.html |archive-date=2007-06-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to "patois", [[Jean Jaurès]] famously claimed that "one names ''patois'' the language of a defeated nation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rleb07.free.fr/opinions/vecteur.html A new "Common Vector", Robert L.E. Billon, April 2000, rleb07.free.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Chambers Dictionary]]'', the origin of the term is disputed but could be a "corruption of ''patrois'', from [[Vulgar Latin|LL]] ''patriensis'', a local inhabitant".

Four months earlier (January 27), [[Bertrand Barère]], although an Occitan from [[Tarbes]] himself, claimed before this same Convention:
{{quote|The monarchy had reasons to resemble the [[Tower of Babel]]; in [[democracy]], leaving the citizens to ignore the national language [that of Paris], unable to control the power, is betraying the motherland... For a free people, the tongue must be one and the same for everyone.

===The end of traditional provinces===
This policy can be noted by the way France's internal borders were redrawn, creating 83 [[Departments of France|''départements'']]. The law was passed on December 22, 1789 and took effect the following year, on March 4, 1790. As a result, the centuries-old singularities of the various Occitan-speaking parts were overlooked and shaken in a deliberate effort by the newly formed government to weaken and parcel out long-established feudal domains so that republican France would subdue traditional allegiances, as [[Antonin Perbòsc]] reveals in the Foreword to his ''Anthologie'':
{{quote|When the ''Constituante'' ([[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]]) created the ''départements'', their goal was clearly to erase the old geographical and historical distinction of the provinces; however this goal was not as perfectly met as some would have liked: in general, the ''départements'' were made up of pieces of existing provinces, quite seldom of the reunion of parts from different provinces. If one could criticize this territorial division for being too arbitrary and too geometric, what can be said of [[Tarn-et-Garonne]], born of a ''sénatus-consule'' (a law by the [[Senate (France)|Senate of France]]) on November 2, 1808? Of course, one may think that the ''Centralisateur'' ([[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]) felt real pleasure showing he could do even better than the ''centralisateurs'' of the National Constituent Assembly. With fragments of [[Quercy]], [[Rouergue]], [[Agen]]ais, [[Lomagne]], [[Gascony]] and [[Languedoc]], creating a new unit so little vast and yet so diverse of soil, language and race, what a great idea! And maybe the audacious half-god had only one regret: coming a little too late to redesign according to this pattern all the provinces of old France...&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Georges Labouysse's ''Histoire de France: L'Imposture. Mensonges et manipulations de l'Histoire officielle'' p. 234. IEO Edicions&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 20th century, the ''départements'' were grouped into ''[[Regions of France|régions]]'', to create a level of government between the departmental and national. While the ''régions'' were intended to replace the old provinces, they were not necessarily formed along the same boundaries. As the map shows, there were eleven Occitan-speaking enclaves in the pre-1789 state, such as the powerful lands of [[Languedoc]] and [[Gascony]], but they were divided into seven ''régions'' with no regard whatsoever for cultural and linguistic identities. This is how [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] was created out of portions of five Occitan provinces and three capitals were scrapped in favour of [[Marseille]]; and [[Auvergne]] came to comprise both native and ''langues d'oïl'' entities. Meanwhile, the city of [[Nantes]] was administratively removed from [[Brittany]], of which it had been one of two traditional capitals (along with [[Rennes]]), and the city of [[Toulouse]] was not included in the ''région'' of [[Languedoc-Roussillon]], though it had historically been located in that province.

Many of the ''régions'' contain hyphenated names, reflecting the merging of multiple historically distinct areas.  This is true for four of the seven ''régions'' of Occitania: Languedoc-Roussillon, [[Midi-Pyrénées]], Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur and [[Rhône-Alpes]].

==Late 19th century – Policies and legacy of Jules Ferry==
===School discipline===
In the 1880s, [[Jules Ferry]] implemented a series of strict measures to further weaken ''regional'' languages in France, as shown in Bernard Poignant's 1998 report to [[Lionel Jospin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chez.com/buan1/poignant.htm LANGUES ET CULTURES REGIONALES – Rapport de Monsieur Bernard Poignant – Maire de Quimper A Monsieur Lionel Jospin – Premier Ministre Le 1er juillet 1998, chez.com]&lt;/ref&gt; These included children being given [[punishments]] by their teachers for speaking Occitan in a [[Toulouse]] school or [[Breton language|Breton]] in [[Brittany]]. Art. 30 of ''Loi d'éducation française'' (French Teaching Law, 1851) stated that: "It is strictly forbidden to speak patois during classes or breaks."

[[File:SpeakFrenchBeClean.jpg|thumb|right|"Speak French, Be Clean" written on the wall of the [[Ayguatébia-Talau]] school]]

Among other well-known humiliations was ''clogging'' young rebels, namely hanging a clog (''sabot'') around their necks as this young lady recalls her grandparents telling her:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~SuuHialat/hialat3c.html |title=Ecoles Diwan, la bosse du breton|last=de la Casinière|first=Nicolas|date=October 1, 1998|language=fr|accessdate=2008-06-28 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19991014020922/http://members.tripod.com/~SuuHialat/hialat3c.html |archivedate=1999-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My grandparents speak Breton too, though not with me. As children, they used to [[Rulering (punishment)|have their fingers smacked]] if they happened to say a word in Breton. Back then, the French of the Republic, one and indivisible, was to be heard in all schools and those who dared challenge this policy were humiliated with having to wear a clog around their necks or kneel down on a ruler under a sign that read: "It is forbidden to spit on the ground and speak Breton".&lt;ref&gt;[http://bretagne.lalibreblogs.be/media/01/00/3d75e7dbef78f875f7cc337be5138241.jpg An example sign at bretagne.lalibreblogs.be]. The sign reads (in French): "To all school pupils: It is forbidden 1. to speak Breton and spit on the ground; 2. to wet your fingers with your mouth to turn the pages of books and notebooks; 3. to insert the tip of a pen or penholder into your ear; 4. to clean your slates with your spit or directly with your tongue; 5. to hold pens, penholders, coins etc between your lips. Now do you want to know why these things are forbidden? Ask your teachers: they will give you the necessary explanations. And remember your duty is not just to obey these rules but to make sure everyone else applies them."&lt;/ref&gt; That's the reason why some older folks won't transmit the language to their children: it brings trouble upon yourself...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This practice was referred to as [[Symbole|le symbole]] by officials and "la vache" (the cow) by pupils, with offenders becoming "vachards". Many objects were used, not just clogs: horseshoes, shingles, slates, wooden plates with a message, coins with a cross on them. The following are official instructions from a [[Finistère]] sub-prefect to teachers in 1845: "And remember, Gents: you were given your position in order to kill the Breton language."&lt;ref name="France pp. 90-92"&gt;Georges Labouysse in ''Histoire de France: L'Imposture. Mensonges et manipulations de l'Histoire officielle'' pp. 90–92. IEO Edicions&lt;/ref&gt; The prefect of [[Basses-Pyrénées]] in the French [[Northern Basque Country|Basque Country]] wrote in 1846: "Our schools in the Basque Country are particularly meant to substitute the [[Basque language]] with French..."&lt;ref name="France pp. 90-92"/&gt;

Resorting to the practice of ''clogging'' is confirmed by the Autonomes de Solidarité Laïques website:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonome-solidarite.fr/?fas-usu=tribune&amp;type=politique&amp;id=1497 La neutralité politique, philosophique et religieuse et l’école, Autonomes de Solidarité Laïques website]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
School has had a unifying role inasmuch as speaking the "noble" language [French] reduced the use of regional dialects and ''patois''. Let us mention the humiliation of children made to wear a clog around their necks for inadvertently speaking a word in the language of the people.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As for signs, they were also found in [[Poitou]] schools:&lt;ref&gt;[http://parlange.free.fr/pages/bas_poitevin.html Parlange : témoignages sur les patois du Bas-Poitou, parlange.free.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It seems as though Jules Ferry making school free and compulsory in 1881 materialized the work started four centuries earlier [with the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]]]; the method of repression and humiliation that was undertaken bore fruit with, for instance, the famous signs in school reading: "It is forbidden to spit on the ground and speak ''patois''."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Conselh de Representacion Generala de la Joventut d'Òc (CRGJOC, General Representation Council of the Occitan Youth), through the Youth of European Nationalities website,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050421083901/http://www.yeni.org/default.php?s=members&amp;p=members/membersitem.php&amp;id=204&amp;m=&amp;l=english Conselh de Representacion Generala de la Joventut d'Òc (CRGJOC) : Organization, at the Youth of European Nationalities Website]&lt;/ref&gt; reports that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our language [Occitan] lost its name, becoming some "''patois''", first at school and then in families through putting pressure on women in education ("''Interdit de cracher par terre et de parler patois''") with the French Third Republic, [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and [[Francisco Franco|Franco]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Confolentés Occitan (Occitan-speaking [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]]) website &lt;ref&gt;[http://ujan.free.fr/englOc2.htm Occitan : a short history, Confolentés Occitan website (ujan.free.fr)]&lt;/ref&gt; testifies of the methods used by French authorities over the past century or so:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To help efface traditional regional identities, the Occitan language was not merely discouraged but actively suppressed. School pupils were punished well within living memory for speaking their native language on school premises.

The French administration managed to make the Occitan speakers think of their own language as a patois, i.e. as a corrupted form of French used only by the ignorant and uneducated. This alienating process is known as ''la vergonha'' ("the shame").

Many older speakers of Occitan still believe that their native language is no more than a shameful patois. This is one reason why you rarely hear it in public — or anywhere outside of the neighbourhood or family circle.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the school of Camélas in [[Northern Catalonia]], a former pupil reports,&lt;ref&gt;''Quatre femmes en Roussillon'', TV show, 1st April 1973&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Everyone but the teacher's children spoke [[Catalan language|Catalan]] among themselves. We'd even get punished for that, because at the time, we all had to speak French. ''Be Clean, Speak French'' could be found written on the school's walls. And if you refused to speak French, they'd give you some sort of wooden sign to wear ''until death came'', as we said, which meant the last offender, in the evening, had twenty lines to copy. We'd speak French in the schoolyard, and for the first ten metres of the way back home, for as long as we thought the teacher would overhear us, and then we'd switch back to our own mother tongue, Catalan.

In those times, Catalan speakers were rather despised. My generation associated speaking Catalan with a disadvantage, with being less than the others, with running the risk of being left behind on the social ladder, in short with bringing trouble.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abbé Grégoire's own terms were kept to designate the languages of France: while Breton referred to the language spoken in Brittany, the word ''patois'' encompassed all [[Romance languages|Romance]] ''dialects'' such as Occitan and [[Franco-Provençal]]. In his report, [[Corsican language|Corsican]] and [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]] were dismissed as "highly degenerate" (''très-dégénérés'') forms of [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[German language|German]], respectively. As a result, some people still call their non-French language ''patois'', encouraged by the fact they were never taught how to write it and made to think only French exists in the written form.

===Pressure on the church===
In 1902, in a speech before the ''[[Conseil général#Administrative role|Conseil Général]]'' of [[Morbihan]], Chief Education Officer Dantzer recommended that "the Church give [[first communion]] only to French-speaking children".&lt;ref name="livre-blanc-et-noir-de-la-langue-bretonne"&gt;[http://www.kervarker.org/fr/levr_27_period.html Livre blanc et noir de la langue bretonne, kervarker.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, prime minister [[Émile Combes]], himself an Occitan, told the prefects of Morbihan, [[Côtes-d'Armor|Côtes-du-Nord]] and [[Finistère]]&lt;ref name="livre-blanc-et-noir-de-la-langue-bretonne" /&gt; that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Breton priests want to keep their flock in ignorance by refusing to promote education and using only the Breton language in religious teachings and [[catechism]]. The Bretons will only be part of the Republic the day they start speaking French.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mid-20th century to the present==
As the doctor in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[philology]] and professor at the [[University of the Balearic Islands]] [[Jaume Corbera Pou]] argues,&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dodeparaula.blogspot.com/search?q=patu%C3%A8s&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When at the mid-19th century, primary school is made compulsory all across the State, it is also made clear that only French will be taught, and the teachers will severely punish any pupil speaking in ''patois''. The aim of the French educational system will consequently not be to dignify the pupils' natural humanity, developing their culture and teaching them to write their language, but rather to humiliate them and morally degrade them for the simple fact of being what tradition and their nature made them. The self-proclaimed country of the "[[Human rights]]" will then ignore one of man's most fundamental rights, the right to be himself and speak the language of his nation. And with that attitude France, the "grande France" that calls itself the champion of liberty, will pass the 20th century, indifferent to the timid protest movements of the various linguistic communities it submitted and the literary prestige they may have given birth to.

[...]

France, that under [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s reign was seen here [in [[Catalonia]]] as the safe haven of freedom, has the miserable honour of being the [only] State of [[Europe]]—and probably the world — that succeeded best in the diabolical task of destroying its own ethnic and linguistic patrimony and moreover, of destroying human family bonds: many parents and children, or grandparents and grandchildren, have different languages, and the latter feel ashamed of the first because they speak a despicable ''patois'', and no element of the grandparents' culture has been transmitted to the younger generation, as if they were born out of a completely new world. This is the French State that has just entered the 21st century, a country where stone monuments and natural landscapes are preserved and respected, but where many centuries of popular creation expressed in different tongues are on the brink of extinction. The "gloire" and the "grandeur" built on a genocide. [[liberté, égalité, fraternité|No liberty, no equality, no fraternity]]: just cultural extermination, this is the real motto of the French Republic.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Constitutional issues===
In 1972, [[Georges Pompidou]], the President of France and a native of an Occitan-speaking region, declared that "there is no room for regional languages in a France whose fate is to mark Europe with its seal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurominority.eu/documents/transferts/Audition%202-3%2007%2007%20discrimination%20linguistique-1.pdf Conséquences sociales, économiques et politiques de la discrimination linguistique.

In a pre-election speech&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pactedeslangues.com/spip.php?article1824 |title=Le temps est venu d’un statut des langues et cultures de France, at pactedeslangues.com |access-date=2008-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908041134/http://pactedeslangues.com/spip.php?article1824 |archive-date=2009-09-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lorient]], on March 14, 1981, [[François Mitterrand]] asserted that:

{{quote|The time has come to give the languages and cultures of France an official status. The time has come to open school doors wide for them, to create regional radio and TV stations to let them be broadcast, to ensure they play all the role they deserve in public life.}}

These declarations however were not followed by any effective measures.
[[File:Occitan Lenga Oficiala.jpg|thumb|Pro-officiality gathering in Carcassonne]]
In 1992, after some questioned the unconstitutional segregation of minority languages in France, Art. II of the 1958 [[French Constitution]] was revised so that "the language of the Republic is French" (''la langue de la République est le français''). This was achieved only months before the [[Council of Europe]] passed the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, Strasbourg, 5.XI.1992]&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Jacques Chirac]] ignored &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/popup_print.php3?id_article=291867 Langues régionales : Jospin saisit Chirac, www.humanite.fr, June 24, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; despite [[Lionel Jospin]]'s plea for the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] to amend Art. II and include all vernacular languages spoken on French soil. Yet again, non-French languages in France were denied official recognition and deemed too dangerous for the unity of the country,&lt;ref&gt;Art. 1 of the French Constitution states that ''La France est une République indivisible, laïque, démocratique et sociale'', France is an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Occitania|Occitans]], [[Basques]], [[Corsicans]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Bretons]], [[Alsace|Alsatians]], [[County of Nice|Nissarts]], [[Savoyards]] and [[Flemings]] have still no explicit legal right to conduct public affairs in their regional languages within their home lands. The text was again refused&lt;ref&gt;[http://ouiaubreton.com/spip.php?article3466 Langues régionales : on verra plus tard, ouiaubreton.com]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Union for a Popular Movement|majority]] deputies on January 18, 2008, after the [[Académie française]] voiced their absolute disapproval&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-societe/2008-06-17/l-academie-francaise-contre-les-langues-regionales-dans-la/920/0/253644&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20080616/53482013513.html&lt;/ref&gt; of so-called regional languages, the recognition of which they perceive as "an attack on French national identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/17/france |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Local language recognition angers French academy |first=Angelique |last=Chrisafis |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] website,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070825082354/http://www.u-m-p.org/propositions/index.php?id=charte_europeene_des_langues_regionales Charte européenne des langues régionales, L'Abécédaire des propositions de Nicolas Sarkozy, UMP website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] denies any mistreatment of regional languages. In a pre-[[French presidential election, 2007|electoral]] speech in [[Besançon]] on 13 March 2007 he claimed:

{{quote|If I'm elected, I won't be in favour of the European Charter for Regional Languages. I don't want a judge with a historical experience of the issue of minorities different from ours deciding tomorrow that a regional language must be considered as a language of the Republic just like French.&lt;br&gt;Because, beyond the text itself, there is a dynamic of interpretations and jurisprudence that can go very far. I am convinced that in France, the land of freedom, no minority is discriminated against and consequently it is not necessary to grant European judges the right to give their opinion on a matter that is consubstantial with our national identity and has absolutely nothing to do with the construction of [[European Union|Europe]].}}

His [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] rival, [[Ségolène Royal]], on the contrary, declared herself ready to sign the Charter in a March 2007 speech &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sego29.over-blog.org/article-5914843.html |title=Charte des langues régionales : C'est OUI, sego29.over-blog.org |access-date=2007-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171421/http://sego29.over-blog.org/article-5914843.html |archive-date=2007-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Northern Basque Country|Iparralde]] for the sake of cultural variety in France:

{{quote|Regional identities represent a tremendous asset for the future and I believe that understanding the link between the fundamental values that make the deep-rooted identity between France and the French nation in its diversity, in its authenticity, in its authentic traditions [...] makes the State work well.}}

On 27 October 2015, the [[Senate (France)|Senate]] rejected a bill for the ratification of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], preventing the adoption of a constitutional reform that would have given a degree of official status to regional languages such as Occitan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le Sénat dit non à la Charte européenne des langues régionales|url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/actu/politique/article/le-senat-rejette-le-projet-de-loi-de-ratification-de-la-charte-europeenne-des-langues-regionales-741405|accessdate=1 November 2015|agency=franceinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>"(suitably altered)" was an unnecessary addition. Maybe some women needed to alter the pants, maybe some didn't. The writer does not provide a citation or evidence that women couldn't wear the pants unaltered. It is not a particularly informative addition, and reinforces extraneous assumptions about individual bodies.

'''[[Trousers]]''' ([[British English]]) or '''pants''' ([[American English]]) first appear in recorded history among nomadic steppe-people in Western Europe. Archaeological evidence suggests that men and women alike wore pants in that cultural context&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/4363815/history-women-pants-hillary-clinton/ |last=Steinmetz |first=Katy |title=From Horse People to Hillary Clinton: A History of Women Wearing Pants |publisher=Time |accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, for much of modern history, the use of trousers has been restricted to men. In many regions, this norm was enforced not only by social custom but also by law. There are, however, many historical cases of women wearing trousers in defiance of these norms, for a variety of reasons, including comfort, freedom of movement, fashion, disguise (notably for runaway [[Slavery_in_the_United_States|slaves]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://co-op.antiochcollege.edu/fashion-crimes-the-rabbit-hole-of-criminalized-cross-dressing-in-us-history/ |title=Fashion Crimes: The Rabbit Hole of Criminalized Cross-Dressing in US History: Mallory Drover ’19 at Boston MFA |website=Antioch Engaged |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), attempts to evade the [[gender pay gap]], and attempts to establish an empowered public identity for women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mattingly |first=Carol |title=Appropriate[ing] Dress: Women's Rhetorical Style in Nineteenth-Century America |publisher=SIU Press |date=2002 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BaynXVfJrxcC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Especially in the 20th and 21st centuries, the customs and laws restricting this manner of dress have relaxed dramatically, reflecting a growing acceptance and normalization of the practice. 

Various US cities, in the 19th and 20th centuries, passed legislation barring women from wearing trousers. Representative among these was an 1863 law passed by San Francisco's Board of Supervisors criminalizing appearing in public in “a dress not belonging to his or her sex,” although similar laws existed in [[Columbus, Ohio]] (passed 1848); [[Chicago]], Illinois (passed 1851); [[Houston]], Texas (passed 1864); Orlando, Florida (passed 1907), and approximately two dozen other US cities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/arresting-dress |title=Arresting Dress: Duke University Press |website=Duke University Press |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. (Anti-[[Cross-dressing|crossdressing]] laws continued to pass well into the 20th century, with [[Detroit]], Michigan and [[Miami]], Florida passing laws as late as the 1950s, and [[Cincinnati]], Ohio passing one in 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/arresting-dress |title=Arresting Dress: Duke University Press |website=Duke University Press |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.)

Additionally, existing laws such as anti-vagrancy statutes were pressed into service to ensure that women would dress in accord with the gender norms of the time. One such instance would be New York's anti-vagrancy statute of 1845, which stated that "Every person who, having his face painted, discolored, covered or concealed, or being otherwise disguised, in a manner calculated to prevent him from being identified, shall appear in any road or public highway, or in any field, lot, wood or inclosure, may be pursued and arrested”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fay |first=Joseph |title=Digest of the Laws of the State of New York: Comprising the Revised Statutes and Statutes of General Interest in Force on January 1, 1874, Volume 1 |publisher=James Cockcroft |date=1874 |page=116 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=E8UnAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA116}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This law was used to prosecute women for cross-dressing, on the grounds that their dressing outside of gender norms constituted a "disguise"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://co-op.antiochcollege.edu/fashion-crimes-the-rabbit-hole-of-criminalized-cross-dressing-in-us-history/ |title=Fashion Crimes: The Rabbit Hole of Criminalized Cross-Dressing in US History: Mallory Drover ’19 at Boston MFA |website=Antioch Engaged |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Boston used similar anti-vagrancy laws to arrest [[Emma Snodgrass]] and [[Harriet French]] in 1852. (Snodgrass would be arrested again in Cleveland in 1853, and French would be arrested again in New York in 1856.) French reportedly broke with convention in order to pursue job opportunities open only to men: she claimed to the ''New York Daily Times'' that she could “get more wages” dressed as a man&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/emma-snodgrass-arrested-wearing-pants/ |title=Emma Snodgrass, Arrested for Wearing Pants |website=New England Historical Society |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Anti-vagrancy laws were also used to arrest [[Jennie Westbrook]] in New York, in 1882 and 1883. Westbook's case was said at the time to have "awakened deep interest" among the public, as it was understood that she was attempting to "escape from that bondage [to] which social laws have subjected the sex." Like Harriet French in Boston, West identified work opportunities as her reason for cross-dressing: "Her excuse was that she could make $20 a week in her disguise, while as a 'saleslady' in a fashionable store the pay would be only one-third that amount."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024283/1882-03-09/ed-1/seq-2/ |title=Iron County Register (Ironton, Iron County, Mo.) 1867-1965 |website=Library of Congress: Chronicling America: Historical American Newspapers |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early dress reform==
[[File:Mary edwards walker.jpg|thumb|upright|Mary Edwards Walker, c. 1870. Walker was arrested several times for dressing in male attire.|alt=A black and white image of Mary Walker wearing a suit and standing facing the camera with her right hand tucked into her jacket.]]

In 1851, early women's rights advocate [[Elizabeth Smith Miller]] introduced [[Amelia Bloomer]] to a garment initially known as the "Turkish dress," which featured a knee-length skirt over Turkish-style pantaloons&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/elizabeth-smith-miller.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomer came to advocate and promote the dress, including instructions for making it, in ''[[The_Lily_(newspaper)|The Lily]]'', a newspaper dedicated to the "Emancipation of Woman from Intemperance, Injustice, Prejudice, and Bigotry." This inspired a craze for the dress, which came to be known as [[Bloomers_(clothing)|bloomers]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/amelia-bloomer.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], and [[Lucy Stone]], other early advocates for women's rights, also adopted this style of dress in the 1850s, referring to it as the "freedom dress" {{Citation needed |date=March 2018}}.

Concurrently, some female laborers, notably the [[pit brow women]] working at coal pits in the Wigan area, began wearing trousers beneath a short skirt as a practical component of their uniform. This attracted the attention of the public, and various photographers produced records of the women's unconventional manner of dress through the mid- to late 19th century. 

Another woman who advocated publicly for dress reform was [[Mary Edwards Walker]], the [[Abolitionism_in_the_United_States|abolitionist]] and Civil War surgeon. Walker, who had worn [[Bloomers_(clothing)|bloomers]] while working at a military hospital, wrote in 1871 that women's dress should "protect the person, and allow freedom of motion and circulation, and not make the wearer a slave to it"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Mary Edwards |title=Hit |publisher=The American News Company |date=1871 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Qk4WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Walker openly wore men's trousers, and was arrested several times for wearing male attire (her earliest arrest was 1866, in New York, and her final arrest was in 1913, in Chicago, at the age of 80&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://co-op.antiochcollege.edu/fashion-crimes-the-rabbit-hole-of-criminalized-cross-dressing-in-us-history/ |title=Fashion Crimes: The Rabbit Hole of Criminalized Cross-Dressing in US History: Mallory Drover ’19 at Boston MFA |website=Antioch Engaged |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Changing norms==

===20th century===
====United States and Europe====
=====1900s-1920s=====

[[Image:MDafoeMay1924Crop.jpg|thumb|Women wearing knickerbockers 1924]]

An updated version of the bloomer, for athletic use, was introduced in the 1890s as women's bicycling came into fashion. As activities such as tennis, cycling, and horseback riding became more popular at the turn of the century, women turned to pants or [[knickerbockers (clothing)|knickerbockers]] to provide comfort and freedom of movement in these activities, and some laws made allowances for women's wearing of pants during these activities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/4363815/history-women-pants-hillary-clinton/ |last=Steinmetz |first=Katy |title=From Horse People to Hillary Clinton: A History of Women Wearing Pants |publisher=Time |accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Women increasingly wore trousers as leisurewear in the 1920s and 30s, and working women, including female pilots, often wore trousers{{Citation needed |date=March 2018}}. 

Arrests for cross-dressing did not necessarily cease during this time. For instance, in 1919, labor leader [[Luisa Capetillo]] became the first woman in [[Puerto Rico]] to wear trousers in public. Capetillo was sent to jail for what was then considered to be a crime in Puerto Rico, although the judge later dropped the charges against her.

=====1930s=====
Actresses [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]] were often photographed in trousers in the 1930s; Dietrich famously appearing in a black [[tuxedo]] and matching fedora at the 1932 premiere of ''[[The_Sign_of_the_Cross_(1932_film)|The Sign of the Cross]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laacollective.org/work/the-audacity-of-pants/ |last=Finamore |first=Michelle |title=The Audacity of Pants |publisher=Los Angeles Archivists Collective |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] became the first [[First Lady]] to appear in pants at a formal function, presiding over the [[Easter Egg Roll]] in 1933 wearing riding pants, a consequence of not having time to change after an early morning ride. However, she seemed to embrace the unconventional circumstance, posing for a photo in the pants on the [[South Portico]] of the White House&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstladies.org/blog/first-ladies-wearing-pants/ |last=Anthony |first=Carl |title=First Ladies Wearing Pants |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' featured its first spread of women wearing slacks in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/4363815/history-women-pants-hillary-clinton/ |last=Steinmetz |first=Katy |title=From Horse People to Hillary Clinton: A History of Women Wearing Pants |publisher=Time |accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====1940s &amp; 1950s=====
During [[World War II]], women working in industrial work in war service wore their husbands' trousers, and in the post-war era trousers were still common casual wear for gardening, socialising, and other leisure pursuits{{Citation needed |date=March 2018}}.

Similarly, in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the [[Second World War]], because of the rationing of clothing, many women took to wearing their husbands' civilian clothes to work while their husbands were away in the armed forces. This was partly because they were seen as work garments, and partly to allow women to keep their clothing allowance for other uses. As the men's clothes wore out, replacements were needed, so that by the summer of 1944 it was reported that sales of women's trousers were five times more than in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;L.W.N. Smith. [http://www.worldwar2exraf.co.uk/Online%20Museum/Museum%20Docs/clothing3.html Clothes Rationing in World War 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, the Government Code Section 12947.5 (part of the [[California Fair Employment and Housing Act]], passed in [[California]]) expressly protected the right to wear pants ([[American English]] for trousers).&lt;ref&gt;[http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/GOV/1/2/d3/2.8/6/1/s12947.5 California Government Code Section 12947.5].&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the standard FEHA discrimination complaint form now includes an option for "denied the right to wear pants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/res/docs/RTS/RTS%20Instructions%20and%20Form%20(2-13).pdf Instructions to Obtain Right to Sue Notice by Mail], California Department of Fair Housing and Employment, February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====1960s &amp; 1970s=====
[[File:Yves_St_Laurent_le_smoking_at_deYoung_Museum_San_Francisco.jpg|thumb |border |right |240x240 px |alt=Yves Saint Laurent, Le Smoking, 1966 |Yves Saint Laurent, Le Smoking, 1966]]

In the 1960s, [[André Courrèges]] introduced jeans for women, leading to the era of [[designer clothing|designer jeans]]. And in 1966, [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] introduced ''Le Smoking'', a woman’s tuxedo intended for formal occasions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laacollective.org/work/the-audacity-of-pants/ |last=Finamore |first=Michelle |title=The Audacity of Pants |publisher=Los Angeles Archivists Collective |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, famously photographed by [[Helmut Newton]] in a manner emphasizing the wearer's [[androgyny]] and suggesting [[lesbian]] overtones.

In 1969 Rep. [[Charlotte Reid]] (R-Ill.) became the first woman to wear trousers in the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reliable |first=The |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/post/update-first-woman-to-wear-pants-on-house-floor-rep-charlotte-reid/2011/12/21/gIQAVLD99O_blog.html |title=Update: First woman to wear pants on House floor, Rep. Charlotte Reid - The Reliable Source |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2011-12-21 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1969, [[Barbra Streisand]] became the first woman to attend the Oscars in pants, accepting an award for her role in ''[[Funny_Girl_(film)|Funny Girl]]'' dressed in an outfit designed by [[Arnold Scaasi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laacollective.org/work/the-audacity-of-pants/ |last=Finamore |first=Michelle |title=The Audacity of Pants |publisher=Los Angeles Archivists Collective |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1972, [[Pat Nixon]] was the first American [[First Lady]] to model pants in a national magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carlanthonyonline.com/2012/03/16/the-first-lady-a-nation-never-knew-pat-nixon-in-private-taped-phone-calls-100-pictures-on-her-centennial/ |title=The First Lady a Nation Never Knew: Pat Nixon in Private Taped Phone Calls &amp; 100 Pictures on Her Centennial |publisher=Carl Anthony Online |date=March 16, 2012 |accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[First Lady|First Ladies]] had been seen earlier wearing pants, including [[Lou Hoover]] (photographed privately wearing riding pants at the presidential retreat [[Camp Rapidan]]) and [[Jackie Kennedy]] (photographed wearing pants and a sweater on Cape Cod in 1960 and wearing [[palazzo pants]] in Italy in 1962)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstladies.org/blog/first-ladies-wearing-pants/ |last=Anthony |first=Carl |title=First Ladies Wearing Pants |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1972, the [[Education Amendments of 1972]] passed in the United States, which, as part of the [[Title IX]] non-discrimination provisions, declared that dresses could not be required of girls. Dress codes thus changed in public schools across the United States.

In the 1970s, trousers became quite fashionable for women. [[Jane Fonda]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Tatum O’Neal]], and [[Diane Keaton]] all helped to popularize the wearing of pants, appearing at high-profile awards ceremonies dressed in suits or pants ensembles; Tatum O'Neal notably accepted an Oscar at age 10 while wearing a tuxedo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laacollective.org/work/the-audacity-of-pants/ |last=Finamore |first=Michelle |title=The Audacity of Pants |publisher=Los Angeles Archivists Collective |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=====1980s &amp; 1990s=====
In 1989 California state senator [[Rebecca Morgan]] became the first woman to wear trousers in a U.S. state senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=19890207&amp;id=m5ozAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lTIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7060,4772564|title=Lodi News-Sentinel - Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hillary Clinton]] was the first woman to wear trousers in an official U.S. First Lady portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Betsi Fores |url=http://rare.us/story/flashback-top-7-hillary-rodham-clinton-pant-suits/ |title=Flashback: Top 7 Hillary Rodham Clinton pant suits &amp;#124; Rare |publisher=Rare.us |date=2013-06-19 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were not allowed to wear trousers on the U.S. Senate floor until 1993.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune2004"&gt;{{cite web|date=January 21, 2004|author=Robin Givhan|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-01-21/features/0401210033_1_carol-moseley-braun-wore-jacket |title=Moseley Braun: Lady in red |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rollcall1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper |first=Kent |url=http://www.rollcall.com/features/50th-Anniversary_2005/fifty_anniversary/-9592-1.html |title=The Long and Short of Capitol Style : Roll Call Special Features 50th Anniversary |publisher=Rollcall.com |date=2005-06-09 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Senators [[Barbara Mikulski]] and [[Carol Moseley Braun]] wore trousers onto the floor in defiance of the rule, and female support staff followed soon after, with the rule being amended later that year by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms [[Martha Pope]] to allow women to wear trousers on the floor so long as they also wore a jacket.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rollcall1"/&gt;

====Africa====
In 1994, [[Malawi]] women became legally allowed to wear trousers under President [[Kamuzu Banda]]'s rule.&lt;ref name="Malawi in Pictures"&gt;Sarah DeCapua, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQuk3icokBQC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=Malawian+women+wearing+pants&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rBFZgDz7p8&amp;sig=jQe_Bx9Tetqv-h0LK0WozfetGeU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-2I4TfelLYbVgAem8r26CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Malawian%20women%20wearing%20pants&amp;f=false ''Malawi in Pictures''], 2009, pg 7.&lt;/ref&gt;, originally prohibited by a law introduced in 1965.&lt;ref name="152.111.1.88"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/1993/12/1/9/7.html |title=Beeld JOHANNESBURG FINAAL Woensdag 1 Desember 1993 Bl. 9: Malawi-vroue mag broek dra |publisher=152.111.1.88 |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
====International norms====

Since 2004 the [[International Skating Union]] has allowed women to wear trousers instead of skirts in competition if they wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skatetoday.com/2004/12/05/slovak-pair-tests-new-isu-costume-rules/|title=Slovak Pair Tests New ISU Costume Rules - Skate Today|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a bylaw requiring women in Paris, France to ask permission from city authorities before "dressing as men", including wearing trousers (with exceptions for those "holding a bicycle handlebar or the reins of a horse") was declared officially revoked by France's Women's Rights Minister, [[Najat Vallaud-Belkacem]].&lt;ref name="newsfeed.time.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/02/04/it-is-now-legal-for-women-to-wear-pants-in-paris/#ixzz2kp0hXoqW |title=It Is Now Legal for Women to Wear Pants in Paris| work=Time | date=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bylaw was originally intended to prevent women from wearing the pantalons fashionable with Parisian rebels in the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="newsfeed.time.com"/&gt;

Also in 2013, Turkey's parliament ended a ban on women lawmakers wearing trousers in its assembly.&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://news.yahoo.com/turkey-lifts-ban-trousers-women-mps-parliament-101916575.html |title=Turkey lifts ban on trousers for women MPs in parliament - Yahoo News |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, an Indian family court in [[Mumbai]] ruled that a husband objecting to his wife wearing a [[kurta]] and [[jeans]] and forcing her to wear a [[sari]] amounts to cruelty inflicted by the husband and can be a grounds for divorce.&lt;ref name="gulfnews1"&gt;{{cite web|author=PTI |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/asia/india/wife-s-jeans-ban-is-grounds-for-divorce-india-court-rules-1.1353273 |title=Wife's jeans ban is grounds for divorce, India court rules |publisher=GulfNews.com |date=2014-06-28 |accessdate=2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wife was thus granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty as defined under section 27(1)(d) of Special Marriage Act, 1954.&lt;ref name="gulfnews1"/&gt;

====Workplace norms====
Women were not allowed to wear trousers on the U.S. Senate floor until 1993.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune2004"&gt;{{cite web|date=January 21, 2004|author=Robin Givhan|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-01-21/features/0401210033_1_carol-moseley-braun-wore-jacket |title=Moseley Braun: Lady in red |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rollcall1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper |first=Kent |url=http://www.rollcall.com/features/50th-Anniversary_2005/fifty_anniversary/-9592-1.html |title=The Long and Short of Capitol Style : Roll Call Special Features 50th Anniversary |publisher=Rollcall.com |date=2005-06-09 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Senators [[Barbara Mikulski]] and [[Carol Moseley Braun]] wore trousers onto the floor in defiance of the rule, and female support staff followed soon after, with the rule being amended later that year by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms [[Martha Pope]] to allow women to wear trousers on the floor so long as they also wore a jacket.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rollcall1"/&gt;

In 2012 the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] began to allow women to wear trousers and boots with all their formal uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore |first=Dene |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/life/fashion-beauty/Female+Mounties+earn+right+wear+pants+boots+with+formal+uniforms/7102550/story.html?__lsa=067d-6627 |title=Female Mounties earn right to wear pants and boots with all formal uniforms |publisher=Vancouversun.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2016 some female crew members on [[British Airways]] were required to wear British Airways’ standard "ambassador" uniform, which has not traditionally included trousers.&lt;ref name="thinkprogress.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/culture/2016/02/06/3746877/british-airways-pants/|title=Because It Is 2016, British Airways Finally Agrees Female Employees May Wear Pants To Work|work=ThinkProgress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] announced that its female employees could wear "professional pantsuits and dress slacks" while at work; dresses and skirts had previously been required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/the-mormon-church-just-allowed-female-employees-to-wear |title=The Mormon Church Just Allowed Female Employees To Wear Pants.

====School norms====
Most UK schools allow female pupils to wear trousers, but many girls still wear skirts in primary and secondary schools, even where the choice of trousers is given.  In the late 20th and early 21st century, many schools began changing their uniform rules to allow trousers for girls amidst opposition to skirts-only policies - the most publicised possibly being Jo Hale vs Whickam Comprehensive in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rebecca Smithers Education Correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/feb/24/schools.news |title=Girl wins battle to wear trousers to school &amp;#124; Education |publisher=The Guardian |date=2000-02-24 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although commonly accepted that girls may wear trousers to school, no test case is known to have been brought before the courts, making the legal position uncertain on requiring skirts as part of girls' uniforms.  The rule is still enforced in many schools, particularly independent and selective state schools.  In fact, government guidelines expressly state the decision of allowing girls to wear trousers is with individual schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/school-uniform |title=School uniform |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2014-06-27 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remaining prohibitions==

===Religious prohibitions===
There are a number of [[religion]]s that prohibit women from revealing their legs, requiring all women and often young girls not to wear trousers but a long dress{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}. By contrast, a sizable majority of [[Sikhs]] often believe wearing trousers is preferred for Sikh women to maintain modesty.

Although many contemporary [[Mennonites]] have no dress code, among traditional, conservative Mennonites, sometimes referred to as "Old Order Mennonites", long skirts or dresses covering most of the legs are required. They also wear dresses and skirts because they believe men and women should be distinguished from one another. "Deuteronomy 22:5
The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God." (KJV)  Conservative conferences usually demand that women wear a specific style of dress. This is usually in the style of the cape dress, with a double covering or "cape". Most non-conservative conferences allow for the wearing of trousers by women.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

[[Pentecostal]] women typically wear skirts because of the Biblical commandment in the Old Testament that women must not wear men's clothing; this is mandatory in some oneness Pentecostal churches (at the individual pastor's discretion).{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Many [[Independent Fundamental Baptist]] churches, colleges and universities prohibit females from wearing trousers. For example, at [[Pensacola Christian College]], female students may only wear trousers or shorts for "recreational purposes" only. They are also required to wear skirts or dresses until 5:00 PM on workdays&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcci.edu/pathway/StudentResponsibilities/CollegeStandards.aspx|title=College Standards · Student Responsibilities · Pathway · Pensacola Christian College|website=www.pcci.edu|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In Orthodox Jewish belief, the space between a woman's legs is considered to be a private area, and therefore, must be covered by a garment{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}. However, in other cultures wearing men's clothing is forbidden biblically under the prohibition of ''Lo Silbash'' ("A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man", {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:5|HE}}). In some [[Jewish ethnicities|Jewish communities]], such as the Jews from Arab countries and [[Modern Orthodox]] communities, it is reasoned that trousers provide an extra form of modesty.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

On 13 November 866, [[Pope Nicholas I]] wrote to King [[Boris I of Bulgaria]]: "Whether you or your women wear or do not wear trousers neither impedes your salvation nor leads to any increase of your virtue"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravoslavieto.com/history/09/866_responce_pope_Nicholas_I.htm#gen52 The Responses of Pope Nicholas I to the Questions of the Bulgars A.D. 866 (Letter 99)], translated by W. L. North (1998) from the edition of Ernest Perels, in MGH Epistolae VI, Berlin, 1925, pp.568-600.&lt;/ref&gt; (''sive vos, sive feminae vestrae, sive deponatis, sive induatis femoralia, nec saluti officit, nec ad virtutum vestrarum proficit incrementum'' - [[Patrologia Latina]], CXIX, 1002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/search?q=femoralia|title=RORATE CÆLI: Search results for femoralia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the [[Society of Saint Pius X]] have spoken of the preference of women's wearing skirts rather than trousers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sspx.ca/Documents/Bishop-Williamson/September1-1991.htm Letter on trousers]&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Siri's letter has also been cited as justification for women wearing skirts and dresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olrl.org/virtues/pants.shtml|title=Notification Concerning Men's Dress Worn By Women|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], the Church's principal theologian, also taught that "outward apparel should be consistent with the estate of the person, according to the general custom. Hence it is in itself sinful for a woman to wear man's clothes, or vice versa; and it is expressly forbidden in the Law (Deuteronomy 22)..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3169.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: Modesty in the outward apparel (Secunda Secundae Partis, Q. 169)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 and 2013, some [[Mormon]] women participated in "Wear Pants to Church Day", in which they wore trousers to church instead of the customary dresses to encourage gender equality within [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.christianpost.com/news/mormon-women-observe-wear-pants-to-church-sunday-to-promote-gender-equality-110882/ |title=Mormon Women Observe 'Wear Pants to Church' Sunday to Promote Gender Equality |date=16 December 2013 |author= Gryboski, Michael |work=Christian Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.boiseweekly.com/CityDesk/archives/2013/12/14/lds-women-suit-up-for-second-wear-pants-to-church-day |date=14 December 2013 |author= Seid, Natalie |title=LDS Women Suit Up For Second 'Wear Pants to Church Day' |work=Boise Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over one thousand women participated in this in 2012.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; 

===Dancing===
Many forms of dancing require females to wear skirts or dresses, either by convention or competition rules.  In [[Scottish highland dancing]] for example, women don't wear [[trews]], but instead either wear a skirt or dress including the [[Aboyne dress]] (for the national dances) or the kilt-based outfit for the Highland dances. However, tartan trews can be worn by women in the [[United States]].

===Sudan===
In [[Sudan]], Article 152 of the Memorandum to the 1991 Penal Code prohibits the wearing of "obscene outfits" in public. This law has been used to arrest and prosecute women wearing trousers. Thirteen women including journalist [[Lubna al-Hussein]] were arrested in Khartoum in July 2009 for wearing trousers; ten of the women pleaded guilty and were flogged with ten lashes and fined 250 Sudanese pounds apiece. Lubna al-Hussein considers herself a good Muslim and asserts "Islam does not say whether a woman can wear trousers or not. I'm not afraid of being flogged. It doesn't hurt. But it is insulting." She was eventually found guilty and fined the equivalent of $200 rather than being flogged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/world/africa/08sudan.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first1=Jeffrey | last1=Gettleman | first2=Waleed | last2=Arafat | title=Sudan Court Fines Woman for Wearing Trousers | date=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trousers and sexual violence==
In [[Rome]] in 1992, a 45-year-old driving instructor was accused of rape. When he picked up an 18-year-old girl for her first driving lesson, he allegedly raped her for an hour, then told her that if she was to tell anyone he would kill her. Later that night she told her parents and her parents agreed to help her press charges. While the alleged rapist was convicted and sentenced, the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Italian Supreme Court]] overturned the conviction in 1998 because the victim wore tight jeans. It was argued that she must have necessarily have had to help her attacker remove her jeans, thus making the act [[consensual]] ("because the victim wore very, very tight jeans, she had to help him remove them...and by removing the jeans...it was no longer rape but consensual sex").  The Italian Supreme Court stated in its decision “it is a fact of common experience that it is nearly impossible to slip off tight jeans even partly without the active collaboration of the person who is wearing them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faedi|first=Benedetta|title=Rape, Blue Jeans, and Judicial Developments in Italy|journal=Columbia Journal of European Law|year=2009|archiveurl=https://archive.is/HkiS|archivedate=2012-07-24|url=http://www.cjel.net/online/16_1-faedi/|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling sparked widespread feminist protest. The day after the decision, women in the Italian Parliament protested by wearing jeans and holding placards that read “Jeans: An Alibi for Rape.” As a sign of support, the California Senate and Assembly followed suit. Soon Patricia Giggans, Executive Director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, (now Peace Over Violence) made [[Denim Day]] an annual event. As of 2011 at least 20 U.S. states officially recognize Denim Day in April. Wearing jeans on this day has become an international symbol of protest against erroneous and destructive attitudes about sexual assault. As of 2008 the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Italian Supreme Court]] has overturned their findings, and there is no longer a "denim" defense to the charge of rape.

'''The looting of Polish cultural artifacts during World War II''' was carried out by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] side by side after the [[invasion of Poland]] of 1939. A significant portion of Poland's cultural heritage, estimated at about half a million art objects, was plundered by the occupying powers. Cataloged pieces are still occasionally recovered elsewhere and returned to Poland.

Priceless pieces of art still considered missing or found in Russian museums include works by [[Bernardo Bellotto|Canaletto]], [[Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz]]owa, [[Józef Brandt]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Jacob Jordaens]], [[Frans Luycx]], [[Jacek Malczewski]], [[Raphael]], [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Henryk Siemiradzki]], [[Veit Stoss]], [[Alfred Wierusz-Kowalski]], [[Leon Wyczółkowski]], [[Jan Matejko]], [[Henri Gervex]], [[Ludwig Buchhorn]], [[Józef Simmler]], [[Henri-Pierre Danloux]], [[Jan Miense Molenaer]] and many others.&lt;ref name="sural"&gt;{{cite journal | author =Agnieszka Sural | year =2013 | month = | title =Najcenniejsze dzieła zaginione podczas II wojny światowej |trans-title=The most precious pieces of art missing since WWII | journal =culture.pl | volume = | issue =2013-08-13 | pages = | issn = | url =http://www.culture.pl/baza-sztuki-pelna-tresc/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/eAN5/content/najcenniejsze-dziela-zaginione-podczas-ii-wojny-swiatowej# | publisher=[[Adam Mickiewicz Institute]] | location=Warsaw | accessdate =2013-08-22 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the efforts to locate and retrieve the missing pieces of art, the [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Ministry of Culture and National Heritage]] founded the Database of War Losses, as of 2013 containing over 63,000 entries.&lt;ref name="muzeum-o"&gt;{{cite web | author=Muzeum Utracone (corporate author) | title=About The Lost Museum | publisher=Muzeum Utracone | year=2013 | work= muzeumutracone.pl| url=http://muzeumutracone.pl/o-muzeum/ | accessdate=2013-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The list is periodically sent to over 100 auction houses around the world, published by the Ministry and also submitted to the National Institute of Museology and Collections Protection, Polish embassies, and the Central Registry of Information on Looted Cultural Property 1933-1945 (lootedart.com).&lt;ref name="muzeum-o"/&gt; In addition, the Ministry also founded the Lost Museum website, a virtual museum containing historic photographs of many pieces of art still missing.&lt;ref name="muzeum-o"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;

==Background==
At the beginning of the [[1939 invasion of Poland]], the Polish interwar government attempted to conceal the nation's most valued cultural heritage such as the royal treasures of the [[Wawel Castle]] in [[Kraków]]. The royal accessories including the [[Jagiellonian tapestries]] were secretly shipped to Western Europe and then to Canada among other places. At the end of the war, two parallel Polish governments, the Western-supported [[Polish government-in-exile]] and the Soviet-backed government in [[Communist Poland]] laid claims to these national treasures. The cultural artifacts were released by Canada to the [[People's Republic of Poland]] in February 1961.&lt;ref name="university"/&gt;&lt;ref name="treasures"/&gt;

==Nazi Germany==
Following the [[German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 and the [[occupation of Poland]] by German forces, the Nazi regime attempted to [[Polish culture during World War II|suppress Polish culture]].&lt;ref name="JOG_quote"/&gt; As part of that process, the Nazis confiscated Polish national heritage assets and much private property.&lt;ref name="Knuth2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madajczyk122"/&gt; Acting on the legal decrees of October 19 and December 16 (''Verordnung über die Beschlagnahme Kunstgegeständen im Generalgouvernement''), several German agencies began the process of looting Polish museums and other collections, ostensibly considered necessary for the "securing" of German national interests.&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;

Thousands of art objects were plundered, as the Nazis carried out a plan put in place before the start of hostilities.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The looting was supervised by experts of the ''[[SS]]''-''[[Ahnenerbe]]'', ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' units, who were responsible for art; and, by experts of ''[[Haupttreuhandstelle Ost]]'', who were responsible for confiscating businesses and more mundane objects.&lt;ref name=Madajczyk122/&gt; Nazi officials responsible for carrying-out the plan included [[Hans Posse]], [[Josef Mühlmann]] and his half-brother [[Kajetan Mühlmann|Kajetan]] (a.k.a. Kai, both from the [[SS]]),&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;&lt;ref name="miastospoleczne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miastospoleczne.pl/web/uploads/docs/2c834dc21a2f465b4e247e85ad18e19de4332fc2.pdf |title=Warszawa Oskarża |publisher=Drukarnia Narodowa, M-01526 |work=Przewodnik po wystawie urządzonej przez Biuro Odbudowy Stolicy wespół z Muzeum Narodowym w Warszawie |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |author1=Ministerstwo Kultury i Sztuki |author2=i Ministerstwo Odbudowy Kraju |language=Polish |format=PDF direct download, 91.8 KB |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715001132/http://miastospoleczne.pl/web/uploads/docs/2c834dc21a2f465b4e247e85ad18e19de4332fc2.pdf |archivedate=July 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zab"/&gt; overseen by [[Dagobert Frey]], an SS historian originally also from Austria, selected by Berlin to validate Poland as a "Teutonic land" without Jews.&lt;ref name="dictionaryofarthistorians"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/freyd.htm | title=Frey, Dagobert | publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians | accessdate=August 4, 2012 | author=Department of Art, Art History, and Visual Studies of Duke University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the official looting by Nazi authorities, some looting was also carried out by individuals acting on their own initiative; in fact Mühlmann complained as early as on October 6, 1939, that many items he was tasked to secure had already been moved or simply stolen.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; While the Nazis kept extensive documentation of newly acquired looted art pieces, the system was not foolproof, and they lost track of much of the looted goods during the increasingly haphazard evacuation of Polish territories in 1944.&lt;ref name=zab/&gt;

Most of the important art pieces had been "secured" by the Nazis within six months of September 1939; by the end of 1942, German officials estimated that "over 90%" of the art previously in Poland was in their possession.&lt;ref name=Madajczyk122/&gt; Some art was shipped to German museums, such as the planned ''[[Führermuseum]]'' in [[Linz]], while other art became the private property of Nazi officials.&lt;ref name=Madajczyk122/&gt; In 1940, Hitler received a "gift" from [[Hans Frank]], governor of [[General Government|occupied Poland]] - a collection, prepared by Mühlmann, of 521 of the most valuable art pieces.&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; Frank aided by ''Oberführer'' Mühlmann, an art connoisseur, amassed a large collection of Polish art pieces.&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; The total cost of the Nazi theft and destruction of Polish art is estimated at 11.14 billion dollars (value in 2001 dollars).&lt;ref name="Matelski2005-160"/&gt;

Over 516,000 individual art pieces were taken.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The exact number is uncertain as not all art was registered, and much of that documentation was lost as well.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; Assessment of losses began during World War II under the auspices of the [[Polish government in exile]] and the [[Polish Underground State]]; in 1944, [[Karol Estreicher (junior)|Karol Estreicher]] published in London the first work on this subject, ''Cultural Losses of Poland''.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; A 2010 estimate gave a figure of 75% for the percentage of cultural heritage lost by Poland during the war&lt;ref name="gp"/&gt; (though that estimate covers both destroyed and lost cultural heritage).&lt;ref name="jasinski"/&gt; The looted art included 11,000 paintings by Polish painters; 2,800 paintings by other European painters; 1,400 sculptures; 75,000 manuscripts; 25,000 maps, 22,000 books printed before 1800 (''starodruki''); 300,000 graphics, and hundreds of thousands of other items of artistic and historical value.&lt;ref name="Matelski2005-160"/&gt; The number of looted or destroyed books is estimated at 1.5 million&lt;ref name="Matelski2005-160"/&gt; to as high as 15&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt; or 22 million.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; Even exotic animals were taken from the [[zoo]]s.&lt;ref name="Kisling2000"/&gt;

During the genocidal campaign against the [[Polish Jews]] culminating in the ''[[Aktion Reinhard]]'' of 1942, extortion and mass looting became part of German economics, not only Nazi policy towards Poland's heritage.&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?hl=en-CA&amp;q=cache:_OoZLk7G3wAJ:http://www.deathcamps.org/reinhard/areconomics.html%2Bwww.death-camps.org/reinhard/areconomics&amp;gbv=2&amp;&amp;ct=clnk |title=Aktion Reinhard Economics |publisher=Aktion Reinhard |work=Google's cache |year=2006 |accessdate=30 July 2014 |author=ARC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|Robbery of Polish Jews and looting of their property became the norm. In every town and village, Jews were forced to hand over not merely gold, currency and other valuables, but virtually anything consumable, including furniture and clothing. Even items such as birdcages, door handles and hot-water bottles were looted. Any excuse, or none at all, became the pretext for extortion.&lt;ref name="arc"/&gt;}}

==Soviet Union==
[[File:Пл. Ринок, 4.JPG|thumb|upright|Holdings of ''Lwów Historical Museum'' were taken to the basement of Black House and smashed behind closed doors.&lt;ref name="nimoz-2000"/&gt;]]
After the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet Union invaded Poland]] on September 17, 1939, it similarly engaged in the looting and destruction of the Polish cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;&lt;ref name="nimoz"/&gt; It is estimated that soon after the invasion, about half of Polish museums and similar public institutions were dismantled in the territories occupied by the Soviets. Many items were shipped to Soviet museums such as the [[Moscow Museum of History]] and the [[Central Anti-Religious Museum]] (also in Moscow).&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt; Other collections were simply done away with. For instance, during the liquidation of the Poland's ''Lwów Historical Museum'' in the early 1940, its holdings were transported to the basement of the Black (''Czarna'') [[Kamienica (architecture)|Kamienica]] ''(pictured)'', away from public eye, and deliberately destroyed there.&lt;ref name="nimoz-2000"/&gt;

Following the Soviet advance across the German-occupied Polish lands, the looting and plunder of anything of value continued&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;  up to 1947 even though the looted territories were theoretically assigned to its own ally, the [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]] already.&lt;ref name="jasinski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raack" /&gt; The Soviet forces engaged in particularly extensive plunder in the [[former eastern territories of Germany]] that were to be transferred to Poland, stripping them of any piece of equipment left behind.&lt;ref name="jasinski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MSZ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IPN-MM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IPN-Ś" /&gt; Even the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Stalinist era (1948–1956)|Polish Communists]] felt uneasy about the scope of their crimes. In 1945, the future Chairman of the [[Polish Council of State]], Gen. [[Aleksander Zawadzki]], worried that "raping and looting of the Soviet army would provoke a civil war"&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;

{{see also|Rape during the liberation of Poland|Soviet war crimes}}

The operations of these "war trophy brigades" were regulated by detailed orders issued by Soviet vice-minister of defence [[Nikolai Bulganin]] in early 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ВОЕННАЯ ЛИТЕРАТУРА --[ Первоисточники ]-- Приказы народного комиссара обороны СССР (1943-1945)|url = http://militera.lib.ru/docs/da/nko_1943-1945/14.html|website = militera.lib.ru|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1948 these brigades sent at least 239'000 [[Railroad car|freight cars]] to USSR transporting natural resources, complete factories and individual machines. Town of [[Bydgoszcz]] lost 30 complete factories and 250 ships, from [[Grudziądz]] the army confiscated all machinery from factories, regardless of their size. From [[Toruń]] all [[gristmill]]s were taken, causing temporary deficit of bread. Blachownia Śląska lost a large, German-built [[synthetic fuel]] producing installation, transported to USSR on 10,000 train cars. A similar production line in [[Police, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Police]] was transported using 14,000 cars. [[Gliwice]] lost a pipe factory, [[Bobrek, Cieszyn|Bobrek]] and Łabędy - iron furnaces. Complete power stations were taken from Miechowice, [[Zabrze]], [[Zdzieszowice]], Mikulczyce, Blachownia Śląska i Chełmsk Śląski. Smaller industries were also confiscated in [[Sosnowiec]], [[Dąbrowa Górnicza]], [[Częstochowa]], Zgoda, [[Chorzów]], [[Siemianowice Śląskie|Siemianowice]], [[Poznań]], [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Grudziądz]], [[Toruń]], [[Inowrocław]], [[Włocławek]], [[Chojnice]], [[Łódź]], Dziedzice and [[Oświęcim]].

Farming animals were also significant target of looting: until 1 September 1945 the [[Red Army]] confiscated 506,000 cows, 114,000 sheep and 206,000 horses. In February 1945 alone over 72,000 tons of sugar was taken. In Toruń region alone 14,000 tons of grain, 20,000 of potatoes and 21,000 beetroots were taken during that period. These number represent looting alone, as the Polish government also supplied food to the Red Army officially at that time (150,000 tons of grains, 250,000 tons of potatoes, 25,000 tons of meat and 100,000 tons of straws).

Individual Red Army soldiers were also allowed to send home "war trophies", with the weight depending on their rank, which resulted in widespread looting of private houses of anything valuable, including food, clothes, shoes, radios, jewelry, utensils, clothes, bicycles, and even ceramic toilet bowls. Scale of individual looting can be estimated by the example of Russian town of [[Kursk]], which received only 300 personal parcels from soldiers in January 1945 but till May their number reached 87,000.

After these transports were finished, the Red Army also started looting the train infrastructure itself—repair yards, signalling installations and the rails themselves: around 5,500&amp;nbsp;km of rails were looted.

In 1946 the scale of looting was estimated by Polish authorities at 2.375 billions of 1938 dollars (equivalent of $54 billion in 2015 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ŁUPY WOJENNE|url = http://www.polska-zbrojna.pl/home/articleinmagazineshow/13006?t=LUPY-WOJENNE|website = www.polska-zbrojna.pl|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Największy rabunek w dziejach Pomorza i Kujaw - Express Bydgoski - Bydgoszcz, Kujawy i Pomorze - aktualności, informacje, artykuły, wydarzenia.|url = http://express.bydgoski.pl/990,Najwiekszy-rabunek-w-dziejach-Pomorza-i-Kujaw.html|website = express.bydgoski.pl|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Znienawidzona Armia Czerwona w Łodzi - Dzienniklodzki.pl|url = http://www.dzienniklodzki.pl/artykul/516739,znienawidzona-armia-czerwona-w-lodzi,id,t.html?cookie=1#!|website = www.dzienniklodzki.pl|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rosja jest nam winna 54 miliardy dolarów.

After the war, the Polish [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Ministry of Culture and Art]] took over efforts to compile a list of lost art, locate it and recover it.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The Bureau of Revindication and Damages (''Biuro Rewindykacji i Odszkodowań'') operated from 1945 to 1951.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The realities of the [[Cold War]] made retrieval of looted cultural heritage difficult, and it was only in the 1980s and 1990s that the situation changed.&lt;ref name="MSZ2"/&gt; In 1991, a new body was formed for that purpose, the Bureau of the Government Representative for Polish Cultural Heritage Abroad (''Biuro Pełnomocnika Rządu ds. Polskiego Dziedzictwa Kulturalnego Za Granicą''), operating at the Ministry of Culture and Art.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; In 1999, the initiative received support from the Polish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref name="MSZ3"/&gt; Once a looted piece of art is located, the Polish government issues a request for its restoration, and as noted on the Ministry website, all requests to date have been successful.&lt;ref name=MSZ3/&gt; {{As of|October 2012}}, the Ministry listed 30 objects which had been retrieved in the years 2001-2012.&lt;ref name="MSZ4"/&gt; Among the recovered art is the [[Aleksander Gierymski]]'s ''Jewish Woman''—found by surprise at the ''Eva Aldag'' auction house in [[Buxtehude]] in November 2010, returned to [[National Museum, Warsaw]] at the end of July 2011 and restored.&lt;ref name="gierymski"/&gt;

[[File:Raphael missing.jpg|thumb|[[Raphael]]'s ''[[Portrait of a Young Man (Raphael)|Portrait of a Young Man]]'' reported hidden in a secret bank vault]]
On 1 August 2012, the [[Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] announced that one of the most famous pieces of Polish art, [[Raphael]]'s painting ''[[Portrait of a Young Man (Raphael)|Portrait of a Young Man]]'', had been found "in a bank vault in an undisclosed location"; a ministry spokesman was confident that the painting would eventually be returned to Poland.&lt;ref name="panarmenian"/&gt; In April 2014, [[Francesco Guardi]]'s ''Palace Stairs'' was recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/45012/germany-returns-stolen-polish-art-from-1939/|title=Germany Returns Stolen Polish Art from 1939|last=Fry|first=Maddy|date=2014-04-01|website=Time.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Poland is planning to build a [[virtual museum]], the [[Lost Museum]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Muzeum Utracone|pl}}), which would feature the lost art.&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;

Both Germany and the [[post-Soviet states|countries of the former Soviet Union]] still have much Polish material looted during World War II.&lt;ref name="GW2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rękopis Słowackiego odnaleziony w Rosji"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onet"/&gt; In particular, recovering looted art from the former states of the Soviet Union, such as Russia, is proving difficult.&lt;ref name="wprost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="przeglad-tygodnik"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2002/spring/spoils-of-war-1.html | title=Spoils of War Returned: U.S. Restitution of Nazi-Looted Cultural Treasures to the USSR, 1945 - 1959, Part 1 | author=[[Patricia Kennedy Grimsted]] | journal=[[Prologue (magazine)|Prologue]] | year=Fall 2002 | volume=34 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
