'''''American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America''''' is a 1997 book by [[art critic]] [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]].

==Reception==
''[[BookList]]'' called ''American Visions'' a "sensational history of American art." and wrote "The contrast between the influence of nature and of the city on American art is the fulcrum of Hughes' entire narrative ..."&lt;ref name=buffalo/&gt; and ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice Reviews]]'' stated "The book bears the stamp of the author's aesthetic sensibilities (which value works of art for their technical competence as well as visual and intellectual qualities), his critical acuity, and his accomplished writing."&lt;ref name=buffalo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/900642/Reviews |title=American visions : the epic history of art in America |website=www.buffalolib.org |publisher=Buffalo and Erie County Public Library |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' gave a starred review and described it as an "eminently readable handbook on American art.", writing "His readings of three centuries of both art works and trends are lively, detailed, and persuasive (though perhaps a bit too harsh regarding recent art), and his ultimately pessimistic take is expressed with great clarity. A meaty and illuminating excavation, full of vigor and punch..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-hughes-6/american-visions-the-epic-history-of-an-in-amer/ |title=AMERICAN VISIONS: The Epic History of An in America |date=1 March 1997 |website=www.kirkusreviews.com |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Publishers Weekly]] noted "this is no bland, dumbed-down survey intended to flatter its subject or its audience. Hughes writes with an aesthete's disdain for political posturing, a traditionalist's belief in the importance of technical skills (painters are frequently taken to task for their shoddy draftsmanship) and a pragmatist's contempt for mystagogical bunk.", found "his account of the contemporary scene is disappointingly brief." and concluded "This slashingly witty, briskly paced, ferociously opinionated tour of the American visual landscape is a book that even the most un-likeminded readers will love to hate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-679-42627-1 |title=American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America |date=31 March 1997 |website=www.publishersweekly.com |publisher=PWxyz LLC|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[New York Times]]'' review calls it a "witty and impassioned history of American art from its beginnings to the present day", "beautiful and essential", notes that "Mr. Hughes fortunately remains the critic throughout his historical canvassing, making distinctions and judgments without taking sides." and concludes "With it, Mr. Hughes has made American art safe for the receptive alien deep inside us all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lee Siegel |date=27 April 1997 |title=A critic interprets American art as a perpetual beginning  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/27/reviews/970427.27siegelt.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''American Visions'' has also been reviewed by the ''[[London Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=30 October 1997 |title=Big Daddy |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v19/n21/linda-nochlin/big-daddy |journal=London Review of Books |publisher=LRB Limited |volume=19 |number=21 |pages=10,11 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Journal of American History]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1998 |title=American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11420">'''Avvisi''' ({{IPA-it|avˈviːzo|lang}}; plural: ''avvisi'') were hand-written [[newsletters]] used to convey political, military, and economic [[news]] quickly and efficiently throughout [[Europe]], and more specifically [[Italy]], during the [[early modern period|early modern era (1500-1700)]].  In the beginning avvisi were very similar to letters written from one dignitary to another, but diverged from such letters in the sixteenth century with more standardized practices.  Avvisi can be divided into two categories: 'public' avvisi and 'secret' avvisi, though each copy was often written by the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 212,214,216-217.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Italian language|Italian]], the word '''[[wikt:avviso|avviso]]''' translates to ''notice'', ''warning'', ''advice'', or ''announcement''.

==Origin==
The avvisi found their origins, and peaked, in the early modern Italian world - primarily Rome and Venice.  The popularity and distribution of the avvisi was driven by each court's desire to know what the opposing and even the allied courts are up to.  News networks spread all across Europe, but the avviso itself was generally created in either Rome or Venice, with the rest of Europe simply consuming.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Importance==
Avvisi influenced many aspects of the early modern world including public opinion, political battles, the nature of propaganda, careers, and historical records.

'''Public Opinion'''&lt;br /&gt;
Avvisi helped to develop public opinion by informing, organizing, and providing a voice for the public.  They allowed the general public to learn of the secret dealings of the nation's leaders, form a response, and then have that response actually be heard by their fellow citizens - essentially making them new players in the game of politics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''Politics and War'''&lt;br /&gt;
Though officially renounced by many leaders at the time, avvisi were then used by those very same leaders to wage their political campaigns against one another.  Destruction and [[censorship]] of avvisi was selective, demonstrating that the authorities recognized the importance of spreading news but would have preferred to spread only news that was of benefit to themselves.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Competition quickly led to avvisi being used as propaganda devices both as a machine of war{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and in attempts to turn the mob on their own country.&lt;ref name="DeVivo, Filippo 2005"&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 38. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conflict as a result of avvisi being used as propaganda is certainly not out of the question, either with the public or between nations.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further the avvisi provided the public with political power rarely seen before in the form of 'secret' information that could have allowed them to have influence upon the courts,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and government decisions.&lt;ref name="DeVivo, Filippo 2005"/&gt;  A minority of people, such as [[Paolo Sarpi]], believed that government institutions should rescind their censorship of avvisi and make full use of publication to combat enemy publication.  An example of this includes several pamphlets written by Sarpi in defense of Venice's rights over the Adriatic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''Finances and Wealth'''&lt;br /&gt;
Creation and distribution of avvisi required writers, those who can deliver the news, and those who can grant the information that makes the news and this provided many people with jobs, earning them money through standard means.  In addition, invaluable secrets provided by the avvisi could be used in extortion or allowing individuals to influence prices at market.  Those who used the avvisi in this way held the opinion that the information provided by avvisi could not be stopped and it was thus better to capitalize on it.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 37,38. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History'''&lt;br /&gt;
Avvisi led to a realization of the importance of the after-effects of historical records, whether they be true or not.  [[Paolo Sarpi]]'s work is an excellent example of this, as he states that he may cause more damage dead (through his writing) than he ever had alive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Types==
;Public avvisi
Public avvisi were news letters that were available to anyone who wished to travel to a distribution center in a city.  They were limited to generic, often harmless facts.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 216,217,220.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Secret avvisi
Secret avvisi were news letters available to a restricted audience, much akin to duplicated personal letters.  Their content could be considerably more harmful than the public counterpart, as it could include opinions of top officials and the discussions from secret meetings.  This form of communication often had a very specific purpose.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Distribution==
Distribution of the avvisi began with the sources of information.  Reporters (newsletter writers, menanti, reportisti, gazzettieri) had networks of contacts filtering information from chancelleries, Catholic churches, Protestant churches, foreign embassies,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and shops.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 39,41. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Information was gathered and put together individually or at a [[Scrittoria]] (writer's workshop).  The avvisi would then be distributed by regular news services and organized postal service networks.  Whether newsletters were sent weekly, bi-weekly, or annually depended on the type of news and the writer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 212,219,224.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the public avvisi were presented the news would quickly spread by word of mouth among the illiterate, no longer relying on the avvisi reporters.  The range of information presented within avvisi was very broad, including countries such as France, Italy, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 38,42. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporters==
Writers of avvisi received very little recognition which, quite often, was exactly how they wanted it.  Fear of censorship kept writers from signing work under their own name - for in the early modern era censorship could mean death.  Mutual bonds of trust developed between certain reporters and clients once they found they could trust each other to provide reliable information without any trouble.  The quality of avvisi may fall under question for numerous reasons; the recopying of documents, the translation of documents, and the insertion of opinions for example.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 216,219,220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==
Censorship of avvisi began with [[Pope Pius V]]'s campaign, beginning in 1570CE.  Writers caught distributing what the Catholic Church determined to be defamatory were punished severely - several examples of punishments include death, imprisonment, and torture (sometimes to death).  

The harsh punishments did not prevent writers from continuing in their task, though they were forced to use pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 39. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The avvisi were blamed for causing disputes by church officials and writers.  However, institutions that condemned avvisi found they could do nothing to quell the hand-written newsletters and began to use them to their own benefit, even with bans still in place.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 214,215,217&lt;/ref&gt;  

Religious leaders were not alone in banning newsletters - more secular leaders also laid down limitations and prohibitions, including Venice's [[Council of Ten]] who held bans until at least 1567.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 37. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  

A popular reporter, [[Paolo Sarpi]], was a minority in his time for holding the belief that the spread of information could not be stopped so censorship was a waste of resources.  Sarpi believed that the only way to combat the enemy's newsletters is for the government to have their own avviso.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Printed vs. Written==
It was not until the middle of the seventeenth century that printed avvisi became more common, and even then Venice and Rome abstained from print.  Due to restrictions from censorship on printed works, a sense of urgency, and a desire for personalization hand written avvisi would not be easily replaced by the printing press.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  

Printed works were produced much more slowly and as a result the public would lose interest in the topic before it came to print.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 48. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Further, printed avvisi were less robust in an effort to avoid censors and cut editing time.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Casino'' covers the period through the seventies to early eighties when the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] controlled certain [[Las Vegas]] casinos. Pileggi focuses on the story of [[Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal]], a [[Chicago]] bookmaker working for organized crime, and his friend, partner and also Mafia member, [[Anthony Spilotro]]. Rosenthal supervises the casino operations, while Spilotro provides protection, security and also masterminds jewelry raids that lead to his crew being nicknamed the [[Hole in the Wall Gang]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/28/books/books-of-the-times-the-mob-s-tale-of-sorrow-about-las-vegas.html New York Times: Casino by Nicholas Pileggi]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film version==
The book is the basis for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated film ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112641/ IMDB: Casino]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[1995 in film|1995]]) directed by [[Martin Scorsese]]. The screenplay for ''Casino'' was by Pileggi and Scorsese. Although Pileggi had already written the book and wanted it published in advance of the film version, Scorsese persuaded him to forgo the usual chronology and to release the book after the film.&lt;ref name="Baxter p337"&gt;{{cite book|author=Baxter, John |title=De Niro: A Biography|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main protagonists/antagonists of Rosenthal and Spilotro were portrayed as [[Ace Rothstein]] and [[Nicky Santoro]] by [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Joe Pesci]]. [[Sharon Stone]], playing Rothstein's wife, Ginger, was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] (lost to [[Susan Sarandon]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112641/awards IMDB: Casino: Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colchester Art Society''' was founded in 1946 by a group of artists who lived in [[Colchester]] and the nearby areas, many of whom were also linked to the Colchester School of Art, which is part of [[Colchester Institute]]. The aim of the society was and still is the promotion of the visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colchesterartsociety.co.uk/colchesterartsocietyaboutus.html|title=Colchester Art Society |publisher=Colchester Art Society |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==

In 1946, a period of renewed optimism after the [[Second World War]], a group of young artists eager to exhibit together founded the Colchester Art Society. Some of its founding members were [[Roderic Barrett]], [[Edward Bawden]], [[Henry and Joyce Collins|Henry Collins]], Reg Hazel, [[Cedric Morris]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Henry and Joyce Collins|Joyce Pallot]], [[Rowland Suddaby]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Artists in Britain since 1945|author=David Buckman|year=2006|publisher=Art Dictionaries Ltd|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sylvia St. George.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/colchester-art-society |title=Colchester Art Society |publisher=Artists Biographies |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Creating an Art Community|author=Peter Wakelin|year=1999|publisher=Aztec Press|isbn=0 72 00 04721|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Colchester Art Society was founded following a meeting of local artists called by Reg Hazell who at the time was the head of the Colchester School of Arts. The initial meeting was attended by Henry Collins, Roderic Barrett and the children's illustrator Jenny Ward. Following this initial meeting [[Cedric Morris]] and [[Arthur Lett-Haines]] who ran the [[East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing]] joined the group alongside Joyce Pallot, Sylvia St George and others. The painter John Nash [[Royal Academician|RA]] was invited to be the Society's first president and remained president until his death in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, V. 2008 '' Colchester Institute: Selected works from the Colchester Art Society Collection'' Exhibition Catalogue, The Minories&lt;/ref&gt; Other presidents of the Society have included Cedric Morris, Roderic Barrett and Anthony Atkinson. Cedric Morris was a key figure who encouraged the activities of the Colchester Art Society.&lt;ref&gt;R. Blythe, ''Sir Cedric Morris'', Exhibition Catalogue, The Minories, 13 Sept-19 Oct 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

The first exhibition of the group showed 37 artists and took place in [[Colchester Castle]]. The selection committee decided that the criteria to choose the works would be based purely on merit, regardless of the background, experience or popularity of the artist. This policy remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colchesterartsociety.co.uk |title=Colchester Art Society |publisher=Colchester Art Society |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist and designer Henry Collins designed the posters for the exhibition alongside the society's logo, which is still used today.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, V. 2008 '' Colchester Institute: Selected works from the Colchester Art Society Collection'' Exhibition Catalogue, The Minories&lt;/ref&gt;

At Colchester Art Society's Autumn Exhibition which was held at Colchester Castle in October 1948, Cedric Morris exhibited a portrait of his then-student, [[Lucian Freud]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/profile-lucian-freud-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-happy-man-1191260.html|title=Profile: Lucian Freud: Portrait of the artist as a happy man|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now part of the Tate's collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tate Gallery 1980-82: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions|year=1984|publisher=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permanent Collection==

Since the early years of the foundation of the Colchester Art Society the President, the Chairman of Selectors, and the members of the Panel select works from the exhibitions in order to purchase them and keep them as part of their Permanent Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colchesterartsociety.co.uk |title=The Permanent Collection |publisher=Colchester Art Society |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Permanent Collection includes a number of works produced by renowned East Anglian artists from the past half century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colchesterartsociety.co.uk |title=The Permanent Collection |publisher=Colchester Art Society |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including: [[Roderic Barrett]], [[Arthur Lett-Haines]], Lucy Harwood (who also belonged to the [[East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing]]), [[Blair Hughes-Stanton]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]] (who was the first president of the Colchester Art Society), [[Cedric Morris]], [[Bernard Reynolds]] and Valerie Thornton. Nash bequeathed his personal library and some of his paintings and engravings to [[The Minories, Colchester]], who later sold most of the material to the [[Tate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vbltcollection.org.uk/vbltdetail.asp?record=177a_04 |title=Biography |publisher=The Victor Batte-Lay Trust Collection |accessdate=2014-07-31 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theminories.co.uk/History.htm |title=What about its history? |publisher=The Friends of the Minories Art Gallery |date= |accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colchester Art Society Today ==

The Colchester Art Society provides its members the opportunity to exhibit artworks, to have informal debates and discussion, as well as to access relevant information and support. The group welcomes various art forms, such as painting, sculpture, textiles, ceramics, and works on paper, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colchesterartsociety.co.uk |title=Colchester Art Society |publisher=Colchester Art Society |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history ==

Coleridge originally had no intention of making his notebooks public, but in his later years he came to think of them as a legacy to be passed down to his disciples. He even allowed his friend [[Robert Southey]] to use a number of extracts in their collaborative work ''Omniana'', published in 1812 and reprinted in an expanded form in 1836. In 1895 the poet's grandson [[Ernest Hartley Coleridge]] released a larger selection under the title ''Anima Poetæ'', and the following year the scholar Alois Brandl published in Germany an edition of the first notebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cheshire |first1=Paul |editor1-first=Frederick |editor1-last=Burwick |title=The Oxford Handbook of Samuel Taylor Coleridge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K8cLTvMdO7YC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=%22developing+into+a+legacy%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 November 2012 |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199229536 |pages=292, 296 |chapter=Coleridge's ''Notebooks'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Southey |first1=Robert |last2=Coleridge |first2=S.

Coburn began work on this in the 1930s; the first volume appeared in 1957, and the fifth and final one (completed by Anthony John Harding) in 2002, 11 years after her death.

The '''''Deposition from the Cross''''' is a painting of the [[Deposition of Christ]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] Renaissance master [[Fra Angelico]], executed between 1432 and 1434. It is now housed in the National Museum of [[San Marco, Florence]].

[[Giorgio Vasari]] defined it to have been “painted by a saint or an angel”.

Angelico intervened to complete this altarpiece when it had been already begun by [[Lorenzo Monaco]] for the [[Strozzi Chapel]] in the Florentine church of [[Santa Trinita]]. It portrays Christ supported by several people, with [[Mary Magdalene]] keeping his feet, as a symbol of human repention. A figure on the right, with a red hat, is showing the cross' nails and the horns crown, symbols of passion and sacrifice.

[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], wearing a dark dress, is shown  in the traditional gesture of keeping hands joined.

'''''Driving Miss Daisy''''' is a filmed performance of the 2013 [[Australia]]n [[theatrical production]] of the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[Driving Miss Daisy (play)|play of the same name]] by [[Alfred Uhry]] starring [[Angela Lansbury]], [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Boyd Gaines]] which was produced as a 2014 film by Broadway Near You (United States) in association with [[Umbrella Entertainment]] (Australia).

==Synopsis==
Miss Daisy Werthan ([[Angela Lansbury]]) is a widowed, 72-year-old Jewish woman living in mid-century [[Atlanta]] who is deemed too old to drive by her son Boolie ([[Boyd Gaines]]). He then hires Hoke, an African-American man ([[James Earl Jones]]) to serve as her chauffeur, and what begins as a troubled and hostile pairing soon blossoms into a profound, life-altering friendship that transcends all the societal boundaries placed between them.

[[File:Fairy ring on a suburban lawn 100 1851.jpg|thumb|A fairy ring (possibly ''[[Chlorophyllum molybdites]]'') on a suburban lawn in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]]]

A '''fairy ring''', also known as '''fairy circle''', '''elf circle''', '''elf ring'''&lt;ref&gt;'Chambers's Edinburgh journal, Volume 9'' by William Chambers, Robert Chamber, W. Orr, 1841, Page. 55&lt;/ref&gt; or '''pixie ring''', is a naturally occurring ring or arc of [[mushroom]]s.&lt;ref name=WIF&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Fungus?|website=Australian National Botanic Gardens|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/fungi/what-is-fungus.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rings may grow to over {{convert|10|m}} in diameter, and they become stable over time as the fungus grows and seeks food underground. They are found mainly in [[forest]]ed areas, but also appear in [[grassland]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Fairy Ring |volume=10 |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; or rangelands. Fairy rings are detectable by [[Sporocarp (fungi)|sporocarp]]s (fungal spore pods) in rings or arcs, as well as by a necrotic zone (dead grass), or a ring of dark green grass. Fungus [[mycelium]] is present in the ring or arc underneath.

[[Fairy]] rings are the subject of much [[folklore]] and myth worldwide—particularly in Western Europe. While they are often seen as hazardous or dangerous places, they can sometimes be linked with good fortune.

==Genesis==
The [[mycelium]] of a [[fungus]] growing in the ground absorbs nutrients by secretion of [[enzyme]]s from the tips of the [[hyphae]] (threads making up the mycelium).&lt;ref name=WIF/&gt; This breaks down larger molecules in the soil into smaller molecules that are then absorbed through the walls of the hyphae near their growing tips.&lt;ref name=WIF/&gt; The mycelium will move outward from the center, and when the nutrients in the center are exhausted, the center dies, thereby forming a living ring, from which the fairy ring arises.&lt;ref name=WIF/&gt;

There are two theories regarding the process involved in creating fairy rings. One states that the fairy ring is begun by a [[spore]] from the sporocarpus. The underground presence of the fungus can also cause withering or varying colour or growth of the grass above. The second theory, which is presented in the investigations of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] scientists on the ''[[Tricholoma matsutake]]'' species, shows that fairy rings could be established by connecting neighbouring oval [[Genet (biology)|genet]]s of these mushrooms. If they make an arc or a ring, they continuously grow about the centre of this object.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Necrotic or rapid growth zones==
[[File:FairyRingSchoolField.jpg|thumb|Two fairy rings marked by uneven grass growth (small one in foreground, much bigger one in background). The lush green arcs of grass betray the presence of underground fungal [[mycelium|mycelia]].]]
[[File:Hexenring auf einer Wiese, Sperrberg, Niedergailbach.JPG|thumb|Fairy ring on a meadow]]
One of the manifestations of fairy ring growth is a necrotic zone—an area in which grass or other plant life has withered or died. These zones are caused by the mycelia which, during a very dry year, coat the roots of grasses and other herbs in [[meadow]]s. After some time they are removed by [[biotic factor]]s from the ground, at which stage a zone on the surface soil becomes visible. Patterns other than the basic ring or arc are also possible: circles, doubled arcs, sickle-shaped arcs, and other complicated formations are also formed by this process.  Fungi can deplete the soil of readily available nutrients such as [[nitrogen]], causing plants growing within the circle to be stressed which leads to plant discoloration.  Some fungi also produce chemicals which act like [[plant hormone|hormones]] called [[gibberellin]]s, which affect plant growth, causing rapid luxuriant growth.

Long-term observations of fairy rings on [[Bell Hill, Dorset|Shillingstone Hill]] in Dorset, England, further suggested that the cycle depended on the continuous presence of rabbits. Chalky soils on higher elevations in the counties of Wiltshire and Dorset in southern England used to support many meadow-type fairy rings. Rabbits crop grass very short in open areas and produce nitrogen-rich droppings. Mushrooms need more soil nitrogen than grass does. A ring can start from only a few spores from which the mycelium develops; the fruiting bodies of the mushrooms only appearing later, when sufficient mycelial mass has been generated to support them. Subsequent generations of fungi grow only outwards, because the parent generations have depleted their local nitrogen levels. Meanwhile, rabbits keep cropping the grass, but do not eat the fungi, allowing them to grow through their competition to tower, relatively, above the grass. By the time a circle of mushrooms reaches about {{convert|6|m}} in diameter, rabbit droppings have replenished the nitrogen levels near the centre of the circle, and a secondary ring may start to grow inside the first. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Soil analysis of soil containing mycelium from a wood blewit (''[[Clitocybe nuda]]'') fairy ring under Norway spruce (''[[Picea abies]]'') and Scots pine (''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'') in southeast Sweden yielded fourteen [[Halogenation|halogenated]] low molecular weight organic compounds, three of which were brominated and the others chlorinated. It is unclear whether these were metabolites or pollutants. Brominated compounds are unknown as metabolites from terrestrial fungi.&lt;ref name=hjelm96/&gt;

== Types ==
There are two generally recognised types of fairy ring fungus. Those found in the woods are called ''tethered'', because they are formed by [[mycorrhizal]] fungi living in [[symbiosis]] with trees. Meadow fairy rings are called ''free'', because they are not connected with other organisms. These mushrooms are [[saprotrophic]].
The effects on the grass depend on the type of fungus that is growing; when ''[[Calvatia cyathiformis]]'' is growing in the area grass will grow more abundantly; however, ''[[Leucopaxillus giganteus]]'' will cause the grass to wither.&lt;ref&gt;Böttcher, Helmuth M. ''Miracle Drugs'' William Henemann Ltd. London 1963 p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clitocybe nebularis group.jpg|thumb|''[[Clitocybe nebularis]]'' in part of ring]]
There are about 60 mushroom species which can grow in the fairy ring pattern.&lt;ref name=Kirk2008/&gt; The best known is the edible Scotch bonnet (''[[Marasmius oreades]]''), commonly known as the fairy ring champignon.

One of the largest rings ever found is near [[Belfort]] in France.  Formed by ''[[Infundibulicybe geotropa]]'', it is thought to be about {{convert|600|m}} in diameter and over 700&amp;nbsp;years old.&lt;ref name=gregory82&gt;{{cite journal | author=

=== Oral tradition and folklore ===

A great deal of folklore surrounds fairy rings.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=30}} Their names in European languages often allude to supernatural origins; they are known as ''ronds de sorcières'' ("witches' circles") in French, and ''Hexenringe'' ("witches' rings") in German.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=13}} In German tradition, fairy rings were thought to mark the site of witches' dancing on [[Walpurgis Night]],{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=30}} and Dutch superstition claimed that the circles show where the [[Devil]] set his milk churn. In [[State of Tyrol|Tyrol]], folklore attributed fairy rings to the fiery tails of flying dragons; once a dragon had created such a circle, nothing but toadstools could grow there for seven years. European superstitions routinely warned against entering a fairy ring. French tradition reported that fairy rings were guarded by giant bug-eyed toads that cursed those who violated the circles. In other parts of Europe, entering a fairy ring would result in the loss of an eye.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=13}} Fairy rings are associated with diminutive spirits in the [[Philippines]].{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=12}}

[[Western Europe]]an traditions, including English, Scandinavian and Celtic, claimed that fairy rings are the result of [[elf|elves]] or [[fairy|fairies]] dancing. Such ideas dated to at least the mediæval period; The [[Middle English]] term ''elferingewort'' ("elf-ring"), meaning "a ring of daisies caused by elves' dancing" dates to the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''History of the Goths'' (1628), [[Olaus Magnus]] makes this connection, saying that fairy rings are burned into the ground by the dancing of elves.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=30}} British folklorist [[Thomas Keightley (historian)|Thomas Keightley]] noted that in Scandinavia in the early 20th century, beliefs persisted that fairy rings (''elfdans'') arose from the dancing of elves. Keightley warned that while entering an ''elfdans'' might allow the interloper to see the elves—although this was not guaranteed—it would also put the intruder in thrall to their illusions.{{sfn|Keightley|1905|p=81}}&lt;ref&gt;The term for ''fairy ring'' in modern Norwegian is ''alvedans''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fairy ring on Iceland.jpg|thumb|Fairy rings in moss in Iceland]]
The [[folklore]]s of  [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] contain a wealth of fairy lore, including the idea from which fairy rings take their name: the phenomena result from the dancing of fairies.&lt;ref name="Ripley and Dana 402"&gt;Ripley and Dana 402.&lt;/ref&gt; In 19th-century Wales, where the rings are known as ''cylch y Tylwyth Teg'', fairies were almost invariably described as dancing in a group when encountered,&lt;ref name="Sikes 70"&gt;Sikes 70.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Scotland and Wales in the late 20th century, stories about fairy rings were still common;&lt;ref&gt;Gwyndaf 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett 110"&gt;Bennett 110.&lt;/ref&gt; some Welshmen even claimed to have joined a fairy dance.&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf 163"&gt;Gwyndaf 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian folklorists regarded fairies and witches as related, based in part on the idea that both were believed to dance in circles.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 175.&lt;/ref&gt; These revels are particularly associated with moonlit nights, the rings only becoming visible to mortals the following morning.{{sfn|Keightley|1905|p=297}}&lt;ref&gt;McPherson 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Local variants add other details. An early 20th-century Irish tradition says that fairies enjoy dancing around the [[Crataegus|hawthorn tree]] so that fairy rings often centre on one.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde 39.&lt;/ref&gt; One resident of [[Balquhidder]], Scotland, said that the fairies sit on the mushrooms and use them as dinnertables,&lt;ref name="Bennett 110"/&gt; and a Welsh woman claimed that fairies used the mushrooms as parasols and umbrellas.&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf 163"/&gt; [[Olaus Magnus]] in ''[[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]]'' wrote that the brightness of the fairy ring comes not from the dancing of the fairies, who harm it with their feet, but from [[Puck (mythology)|Puck]], who refreshes the grass.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hazlitt 230.&lt;/ref&gt; A Devon legend says that a black hen and chickens sometimes appear at dusk in a large fairy ring on the edge of [[Dartmoor]].&lt;ref&gt;Coxhead, J. R. W., ''The Devil in Devon'', p. 39-40. Quoted in Briggs 328.&lt;/ref&gt; A Welsh and Manx variant current in the 1960s removes dancing from the picture and claims that fairy rings spring up over an underground fairy village.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R 157"&gt;Radford and Radford 157.&lt;/ref&gt; These associations have become linked to specific sites. For example, "The Pixies' Church" was a rock formation in Dartmoor surrounded by a fairy ring,&lt;ref&gt;Bray 149.&lt;/ref&gt; and a stone circle tops [[Cader Idris]] in northern Wales, believed to be a popular spot for fairy dances. Guernsey Fairy Ring is also a popular spot for fairie dancing and known for having evil fairies living there.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels and Stevens 1300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many folk beliefs generally paint fairy rings as dangerous places, best avoided.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R 157"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cielo 73"&gt;Cielo 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Sikes traces these stories of people trespassing into forbidden territory and being punished for it to the tale of [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche and Eros]]. In it, Psyche is forbidden to view her lover, and when she does so, her palace disappears and she is left alone.&lt;ref&gt;Sikes 85-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Superstition calls fairy circles sacred and warns against violating them lest the interloper (such as a farmer with a plough) anger the fairies and be [[curse]]d.&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf 163"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheviot 398.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bray 150.&lt;/ref&gt; In an Irish legend recorded by [[Lady Wilde|Wilde]], a farmer builds a barn on a fairy ring despite the protests of his neighbours. He is struck senseless one night, and a local "fairy doctor" breaks the curse. The farmer says that he dreamed that he must destroy the barn.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde 234.&lt;/ref&gt; Even collecting dew from the grass or flowers of a fairy ring can bring bad luck. Destroying a fairy ring is unlucky and fruitless; superstition says it will just grow back.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R 157"/&gt;

A traditional Scottish rhyme sums up the danger of such places:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;He wha tills the fairies' green
Nae luck again shall hae :
And he wha spills the fairies' ring
Betide him want and wae.
For weirdless days and weary nights
Are his till his deein' day.
But he wha gaes by the fairy ring,
Nae dule nor pine shall see,
And he wha cleans the fairy ring
An easy death shall dee.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, ''Popular Rhymes'', 324; quoted in McPherson 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Numerous legends focus on mortals entering a fairy ring—and the consequences. One superstition is that anyone who steps into an empty fairy ring will die at a young age.&lt;ref name="Franklin 87"&gt;Franklin 87.&lt;/ref&gt; A 20th-century tradition from [[Somerset]] calls the fairy ring a "galley-trap" and says that a murderer or thief who walks in the ring will be hanged.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs and Tongue 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, someone who violates a fairy perimeter becomes invisible to mortals outside and may find it impossible to leave the circle. Often, the fairies force the mortal to dance to the point of exhaustion, death, or madness.&lt;ref name="Franklin 87"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sikes 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In Welsh tales, fairies actively try to lure mortals into their circles to dance with them.&lt;ref name="Sikes 70"/&gt; A tale from the [[Cambrian Mountains]] of Wales, current in the 19th century, describes a mortal's encounter with a fairy ring:

{{quote|... he saw the Tylwyth Teg, in appearance like tiny soldiers, dancing in a ring. He set out for the scene of revelry, and soon drew near the ring where, in a gay company of males and females, they were footing it to the music of the harp. Never had he seen such handsome people, nor any so enchantingly cheerful. They beckoned him with laughing faces to join them as they leaned backward almost falling, whirling round and round with joined hands. Those who were dancing never swerved from the perfect circle; but some were clambering over the old cromlech, and others chasing each other with surprising swiftness and the greatest glee. Still others rode about on small white horses of the most beautiful form&amp;nbsp;... All this was in silence, for the shepherd could not hear the harps, though he saw them. But now he drew nearer to the circle, and finally ventured to put his foot in the magic ring. The instant he did this, his ears were charmed with strains of the most melodious music he had ever heard.&lt;ref&gt;Howells, W. (1831). ''Cambrian Superstitions'', p. 148; translated in Sikes 83.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Entering the ring on [[May Eve]] or [[Halloween]] night was especially dangerous.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R 157"/&gt; One source near Afon fach Blaen y Cae, a tributary of the Dwyfach, tells of a shepherd accidentally disturbing a ring of rushes where fairies are preparing to dance; they capture him and hold him captive, and he even marries one of them.&lt;ref&gt;Rhys 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In variants from Scotland recorded by [[Edwin Sidney Hartland]] in 1891, the ring is replaced by a cavern or an old mill.&lt;ref&gt;Hartland 165-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom from a fairy ring often requires outside intervention. A tactic from early 20th-century Wales is to cast wild [[marjoram]] and [[thyme]] into the circle and befuddle the fairies;&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan and Hartland 97.&lt;/ref&gt; another asks the rescuer to touch the victim with iron.&lt;ref name="Hartland 163"&gt;Hartland 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Other stories require that the enchanted victim simply be plucked out by someone on the outside,&lt;ref name="Sikes 75"&gt;Sikes 75.&lt;/ref&gt; although even this can be difficult: A farmer in a tale from the [[Llangollen]] region has to tie a rope around himself and enlist four men to pull him from the circle as he goes in to save his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Rhys 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt; Other folk methods rely on Christian faith to break the enchantment: a stick from a [[rowan]] tree (thought to be the wood from which the cross of [[Jesus Christ]] was built) can break the curse,&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf 163"/&gt; as can a simple phrase such as "what, in Heaven's name", as in a 19th-century tale from [[Carmarthenshire]].&lt;ref name="Sikes 72"&gt;Sikes 72.&lt;/ref&gt; A common element to these recoveries is that the rescuer must wait a year and a day from when the victim entered the ring.&lt;ref name="Hartland 163"/&gt;

Mortals who have danced with the fairies are rarely safe after being saved from their enthrallment. Often, they find that what seemed to be but a brief foray into fairyland was indeed much longer in the mortal realm, possibly weeks or years.&lt;ref name="Franklin 87"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartland 166-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The person rescued from the fairy ring may have no memory of their encounter with the sprites, as in a story from Anglesea recorded in 1891.&lt;ref name="Hartland 164"&gt;Hartland 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In most tales, the saved interlopers face a grim fate. For example, in a legend from [[Carmarthenshire]], recorded by Sikes, a man is rescued from a fairy ring only to crumble to dust.&lt;ref name="Sikes 72"/&gt; In a tale from Mathavarn, Llanwrin Parish, a fairy-ring survivor moulders away when he eats his first bite of food.&lt;ref name="Sikes 75"/&gt; Another vulnerability seems to be iron; in a tale from the [[Aberystwyth]] region, a touch from the metal causes a rescued woman to disappear.&lt;ref name="Hartland 164"/&gt;

Some legends assert that the only safe way to investigate a fairy ring is to run around it nine times. This affords the ability to hear the fairies dancing and frolicking underground.&lt;ref name="Cielo 73"/&gt; According to a 20th-century tradition of [[Northumberland]], this must be done under a full moon, and the runner must travel in the direction of the sun; to go [[widdershins]] allows the fairies to place the runner under their sway. To circle the ring a tenth time is foolhardy and dangerous.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R 157"/&gt; Keightley recorded a similar tradition from [[Northumberland]] in 1905: "The children constantly run this number [nine times], but nothing will induce them to venture a tenth run."{{sfn|Keightley|1905|p=310}} A story from early 20th century England says that a mortal can see the sprites without fear if a friend places a foot on that of the person stepping beyond the circle's perimeter.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels and Stevens 1406.&lt;/ref&gt; Another superstition says that wearing a hat backwards can confuse the fairies and prevent them from pulling the wearer into their ring.&lt;ref&gt;Pickering 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they have strong associations with doom, some legends paint fairy circles as places of fertility and fortune. Welsh folk belief is that mountain sheep that eat the grass of a fairy ring flourish, and that crops sown from such a place will prove more bountiful than those from normal land.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=30}} A folk belief recorded in the ''Athenian Oracle'' claims that a house built on a fairy circle will bring prosperity to its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Hazlitt 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a legend from Pont y Wern says that in the 13th or 14th century, the inhabitants of the town of Corwrion watched fairies dancing in a ring around a [[glow worm]] every Sunday after church at a place called Pen y Bonc. They even joined the sprites in their revels. The legend survives in a rhyme: "With the fairies nimbly dancing round / The glow-worm on the Rising Ground."&lt;ref&gt;Rhys 60.&lt;/ref&gt; A Welsh tale recorded by Rhys in 1901 tells of a man who supposedly lived on the side of the [[Berwyn range|Berwyn]], above Cwm Pennant, in the early 19th century. The man destroyed a nest of [[rook (bird)|rook]]s in a tree surrounded by a fairy ring. In gratitude, the fairies gave him a half crown every day but stopped when he told his friends, "for he had broken the rule of the fair folks by making their liberality known".&lt;ref&gt;Rhys 140-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, fairy boons are not without their curses, and tales often tell of the sprites exacting their revenge.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=30}}

=== Literature ===
[[File:Rackham fairy ring.jpg|thumb|"Come, now a roundel." One of [[Arthur Rackham]]'s illustrations to Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.]]
Fairy rings have featured in the works of European authors, playwrights, and artists since the 13th century. In his [[Arthurian romance]] ''Meraugis de Portlesguez'', [[Raoul de Houdenc]] describes a scene clearly derived from Celtic fairy-ring lore: The title character visits the Château des Caroles and sees a circle of women and a knight dancing around a pine in the castle courtyard. Meraugis is unable to fight the intense desire to join in, thus freeing the previous knight from the spell. Meraugis is helpless to leave the dance until, ten weeks later, another knight joins it and frees him.&lt;ref&gt;Paton 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Fairy circles feature in works by several [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] poets and playwrights. [[William Shakespeare]] alludes to them in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', Act II, Scene I&lt;ref name="Franklin 87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazlitt 230"&gt;Hazlitt 230.&lt;/ref&gt; ("And I serve the fairy queen, / To dew her orbs upon the green" and "To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind"),&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', Act II, Scene I.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Tempest]]'', Act V, Scene I:&lt;ref name="Ripley and Dana 402"/&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;... you demi-puppets that
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
To hear the solemn curfew&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, ''The Tempest'', Act V, Scene I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Shakespeare's contemporary [[Thomas Randolph (poet)|Thomas Randolph]] speaks of fairy rings in his ''Amyntas, or the Impossible Dowry'' (1638), and [[Michael Drayton]] describes one in ''Nymphidia: The Court of Fairy'':&lt;ref name="Hazlitt 230"/&gt;

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;And in their courses make that round
In meadows and in marshes found,
Of them so called the Fairy Ground,
{{in5|3}}Of which they have the keeping.&lt;ref&gt;Drayton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Fairy imagery became especially popular in the [[Victorian era]]. [[Thomas Hardy]] uses a fairy ring as a symbol of lost love in ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' (1886); the character Michael Henchard passes a fairy ring and remembers that he last saw his wife Susan there when he sold her to a sailor in a drunken rage.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian poets who have referred to fairy rings in their works include [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], [[Eliza Cook]], [[Robert Stephen Hawker]], [[Felicia Hemans]], [[Gerald Massey]], and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred, Lord Tennyson]].&lt;ref&gt;See Browning, "The Deserted Garden"; Cook, "'Don't You Remember?'"; Hawker, "The Fairy Vision" and "Chorus of Fairies"; Hemans, "Canto III"; Massey, "Love's Fairy-ring"; and Tennyson, "Guinevere".&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. H. Cummings]] composed the cantata ''The Fairy Ring'', and [[William Butler Yeats]] wrote of them in ''[[The Land of Heart's Desire]]'' (1894).&lt;ref&gt;Skelton 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
Fairy circles have appeared in European artwork since at least the 18th century. For example, [[William Blake]] painted ''Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing'', depicting a scene from Shakespeare's ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', around 1785,&lt;ref&gt;Silver 26.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Daniel Maclise]] painted ''Faun and the Fairies'' around 1834. Images of fairies dancing in circles became a favourite trope of [[fairy painting|painters]] in the Victorian period. On the one hand, artists were genuinely interested in the culture such imagery represented, and on the other, fairies could be depicted as titillating nudes and semi-nudes without offending [[Victorian morality|Victorian mores]], which made them a popular subject of art collectors. Examples of Victorian fairy-ring paintings include ''Come unto these Yellow Sands'' (1842) by [[Richard Dadd]] and ''Reconciliation of Titania and Oberon'' (1847) by [[Joseph Noel Paton]].&lt;ref&gt;Silver 230, note 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors published in ''Fiction Weekly'' have appeared in [[anthologies]] such as [[New Stories From the South]], have been nominated for the [[Pushcart Prize]], and have been published in many other well reputed literary magazines including, [[Glimmer Train]], [[The Pinch]], and [[Harpur Palate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://michelle-reed.name/5.html Reed, Michelle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fictionweekly.com/theonionwasme.htm Fiction Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as of May 2010, the website had not been updated for six months. It was stated that the magazine ceased publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What it was|url=http://www.fictionweekly.com/|work=Fiction Weekly|accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fishing''''' (or ''Fishing Scene'') is a painting by Italian artist [[Annibale Carracci]], painted before 1595 and given to [[Louis XIV]] by Prince [[Camillo Pamphili]] in 1665.  It is currently held and exhibited at the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].

==History==
The painting and its companion, ''[[Hunting (Annibale Carracci)|Hunting]]'', were included in [[Charles Le Brun]]'s inventory in 1683, and in November 1695 they were in the apartments of [[King Louis XIV]]'s younger brother. It was no doubt for this purpose that they were given two sumptuous gilt frames, each with attributes suited to the subject of the painting - among the finest examples of the art of [[picture frame|frame-making]] in the time of Louis XIV. In 1955, when the varnish was being cleaned, the 19th century gilding covering the original gilding was removed - a task of some magnitude which was carried out by the French firm of Lebrun.&lt;ref&gt;H. Loyrette, ''The Louvre: All the Paintings'', Black Dog &amp; Leventhal (2011), ''s.v. Carracci''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This work, together with its companion, date from Carracci's [[Bologna|Bolognese]] period, before he left for [[Rome]] in 1595 to paint at the [[Palazzo Farnese|Galleria Farnese]]. At this time he was extremely interested in [[landscape]], and his experiments are a foreshadowing of [[Poussin]]'s classical compositions; but in these pictures he is exploring in a different direction, in the tradition of the [[Bassano (disambiguation)#Visual arts|Bassani]], a family of painters whose studios continued to turn out landscapes which were prized all over [[Europe]]. His interest was the [[countryside]]. Without any religious theme as pretext, he painted two pure landscapes whose true subjects are the forest and the river, motivated by the themes of [[hunting]] and [[fishing]]. Therefore, Carracci was able to show nature animated with the life of the [[aristocracy]] and of ordinary people. The composition follows the visual device of division into compartments.&lt;ref&gt;H. Loyrette, ''ibid.'',  Ch.I, ''Italian School''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Annibale Carracci - Hunting - WGA04417.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[Hunting (Annibale Carracci)|Hunting Scene]]'' by [[Annibale Carracci]] (before 1595), 1.36 m x 2.53 m]]

Together with the Galleria Farnese, the two thematic paintings are Carracci's greatest masterpieces, and have always been much admired by artists. [[Manet]] found inspiration in the ''Fishing'', and the ''[[Hunting (Annibale Carracci)|Hunting]]'' has been copied by [[Matisse]], [[Edvard Munch]] and [[Rouault]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Benati &amp; E. Riccomini, ''Annibale Carracci'', [[Mondadori]] Electa (2006), ''s.v. "Fishing Scene"''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Girls Beyond the Wasteland'''''|少女たちは荒野を目指す|Shōjotachi wa Kōya o Mezasu|lit. ''Girls aim for the wasteland''}}, often abbreviated as {{nihongo|'''''Shokomeza'''''|しょこめざ}} and also known as '''''Girls Beyond the Youth Koya''''' in Japan, is a [[visual novel]] developed by [[Minato Soft]] to be released for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] on March 25, 2016 with a rating for all ages. An anime television series adaptation, produced by [[Project No.9]] and directed by [[Takuya Satō (scriptwriter)|Takuya Satō]], premiered in January 2016.

==Gameplay==
''Girls Beyond the Wasteland'' is a [[Romance (love)|romance]] [[visual novel]] in which the player assumes the role of Buntarō Hōjō. Much of its [[gameplay]] is spent on reading the story's [[narrative]] and [[dialogue]]. The text in the game is accompanied by character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], which represent who Buntarō is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters [[CG artwork]] at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. The game follows a [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching plot line]] with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.

There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each heroine. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. Some decisions can lead the game to end prematurely, which offer an alternative ending to the plot. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction.

'''''Guilty or Innocent of Using the N Word''''' is a 2006 documentary directed by British director Bhavna Malkani.

The documentary explores questions and issues surrounding the word "[[nigger]]" that many feel constrained to discuss, as is often categorized as a [[Word taboo|taboo word]]. The twenty-eight-minute film investigates the word chronologically, discussing the history of the word from its origins all the way to [[hip hop]]'s influence on the acceptance and commercialization of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1536073 IMDB listing]&lt;/ref&gt;

Guest appearances in the documentary include [[M-1 (rapper)|M-1]] of [[Dead Prez]], Grouchy Greg, CEO of allhiphop.com, Philadelphia rapper [[The Last Emperor (rapper)|The Last Emperor]], hip-hop producer/rapper Marchitect and others.

The documentary was filmed in London, England; New York City, New York; [[Newark, Delaware]]; and [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. ''Guilty or Innocent of Using the N Word'' won the London Film Convention Award at the [[Portobello Film Festival]] in 2006 and Best Short Documentary at New York's 5th Annual H20 Odyssey International Hip-Hop Awards in 2007.  The documentary was also short listed to win Best Film at the 5th Buffalo Film Festival in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://bstarproductions.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High technology''', often abbreviated to '''high tech''' (adjective forms '''high-technology''', '''high-tech''' or '''hi-tech''') is [[technology]] that is at the [[state of the art|cutting edge]]: the most advanced technology available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cortright|first1=Joseph|last2=Mayer|first2=Heike|title=High Tech Specialization: A Comparison of High Technology Centers|date=January 2001|publisher=Brookings Institution, Center on Urban &amp; Metropolitan Policy|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/specialization.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of high tech is ''[[low technology]]'', referring to simple, often traditional or mechanical technology; for example, a [[slide rule]] is a low-tech calculating device.

The phrase was used in a 1958 ''[[The New York Times]]'' story advocating "[[Nuclear power|atomic energy]]" for Europe: "... Western Europe, with its dense population and its high technology ...."&lt;ref&gt;"Atomic Power for Europe", ''The New York Times'', February 4, 1958, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Metz used the term in a financial column in 1969: "Arthur H. Collins of Collins Radio] controls a score of high technology patents in variety of fields."&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Robert (1969). "Market Place: Collins Versus The Middle Man", ''The New York Times'', April 24, 1969, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a 1971 article used the abbreviated form, "high tech."&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Robert (1971). "Market Place: So What Made E.D.S. Plunge?", ''The New York Times'', November 11, 1971, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely-used classification of high-technological manufacturing industries is provided by the [[OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;Hatzichronoglou, Thomas: "Revision of the High-Technology Sector and Product Classification", OECD Science, Technology and Industry Working Papers, No. 1997/02, OECD Publishing, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the intensity of research and development activities used in these industries within OECD coutries, resulting in four distinct categories.

'''''I'm too sad to tell you''''' (1970–71) is a [[mixed media]] art work by [[conceptual art]]ist [[Bas Jan Ader]].&lt;ref name = "Bomb"&gt;[http://bombmagazine.org/article/5672/bas-jan-ader-please-don-t-leave-me-in-search-of-the-miraculous-bas-jan-ader-discovery-file   Nato Thompson, “Bas Jan Ader Please Don't Leave Me”, [[Bomb (magazine)]], Summer 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The work includes a three-minute black-and-white silent film, still photographs and a post card all related to him crying for an unknown reason.  The photographs include both a short hair version and a long hair version.&lt;ref name = "NPR"&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/20/transcript [[Ira Glass]], “This American Life 20: From a Distance”, [[NPR]] radio transcript, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; The post cards were mailed to his friends with the inscription “I'm too sad to tell you”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectiveexperience.org/cindy/ader.html Cindy Loehr, “Bas Jan Ader: Retrospective”, ''[[New Art Examiner]]'', March 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was an original, now lost, version of the film called ''Cry Claremont''.  It was shown in the [[Pomona College|Pomona College Gallery]] in [[Claremont, California]] in 1971-72.&lt;ref name="MOMA"&gt;Christophe Cherix, ''In &amp; Out of Amsterdam: Travels in Conceptual Art, 1960-1976'', MOMA, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-87070-753-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for his sadness is never stated in the work.&lt;ref name="Dumbadze"/&gt;

==Composition and history==
The work's original form was a silent black and white movie shot outdoors in 1970 apparently in front of Ader's house.  The movie was shown in Claremont college, but has since been lost.&lt;ref name = MOMA/&gt;  A still from the movie, however, was extracted and made into a post card.  It shows Ader with his head in his hand crying.  The back of the post card had the written inscription “I'm too sad to tell you”.  It was dated September 13, 1970.  The card was mailed to a number of Ader's friends. The image has also been reproduced in a photographic version with the inscription written in the lower right hand corner.  The post card and photograph have become iconic of the work and a symbol that many artists have emulated (see Influence below).  
	
A second version of the film was made in Amsterdam in 1971.  This was more of a performance with Ader appearing to be calm before the shooting and rubbing his eyes during the filming to produce tears and build emotional intensity.  Ten minutes of film was shot with the final version edited to about three and a half minutes.  The edited version captures Ader at his most anguished.  His face is framed closely.  There is no introduction or conclusion, no reason given and no relief from the anguish that is presented.  Critics have said that it is hard not to be affected by the film, with its offering of “raw passion to anyone willing to watch”.&lt;ref name = "Dumbadze"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDouV4K9cEC&amp;pg=PA152 Alexander Dumbadze, “Bas Jan Ader: Death is Elsewhere”, University of Chicago Press, 2013, p 152 et seq.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical interpretation==
The work has inspired many critical interpretations and analysis.

There seems to be an overall tension between the sincerity of the artist's captured emotions and performance aspects of the works.  Artists James Roberts and [[Collier Schorr]], for example, feel the works are at once intensely personal and yet very arbitrary.  There was a true reason for Ader's sadness, but that is not shared with us.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;[http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/bas_jan_ader/ James Roberts and Collier Schorr, “Bas Jan Ader”, ''frieze'' (magazine), June 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bruce Hainley, contributing editor to [[Artforum]], thinks the reasons for his sadness are beside the point.  In his view, Ader walks a fine line between sincerity (the sadness is real) and melodrama (the work is staged multiple times).&lt;ref name = "Hainley"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Legend+of+the+fall.-a054169956 Bruce Hainley, "Legend of the fall." Artforum International , Vol. 37, No. 7, March 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;  Jörg Heiser, coeditor of [[Frieze (magazine)]], views the work as an ironic statement of the artist taking on all of the embarrassment of the expressed emotion while leaving it open as to whether or not the viewer takes on the embarrassment as well.&lt;ref name = "Heiser"&gt;[http://www.artandresearch.org.uk/v2n1/heiser.html , “All of a Sudden: Things that Matter in Contemporary Art”, Art &amp; Research, A Journal of Ideas, Contexts, and Methods, Summer 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women reviewers have been more critical.  Jennifer Doyle in her book ''Hold it Against Me: Difficulty and Emotion in Contemporary Art'' feels the work may be seen as real due to the tradition of the “melancholy white male artist”. She sees this in contrast to how a woman would have been perceived as either acting or in hysterics.&lt;ref name = "Doyle"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j-8DAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85&amp;dq=%22I%27m+too+sad+to+tell+you%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9e_zU7STHoj_yQTCu4LQDA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%27m%20too%20sad%20to%20tell%20you%22&amp;f=false Jennifer Doyle, ''Hold it Against Me: Difficulty and Emotion in Contemporary Art'',  Duke University Press, 12 March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;  Journalist Betty van Garrel goes so far as to say (in translation) "Ader is a sentimental loser, a romantic softie, a problem case and not even original in that."&lt;ref name = "LAS"&gt;[http://www.lostatsea.net/feature.phtml?fid=2150744464607d6c85df96 Samuel Klaus, "Bas Jan Ader, Lost at Sea", ''LAS Magazine'', 7 September 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
''I'm too sad to tell you'' has influenced a large number of artists, with many composing interpretations and [[homage (arts)|homages]] to the work.  These include:
*Alexander Brandt on his goal of imitating Ader's pose in his own self-portrait: 
::''“My appropriation of this visual has a strategic aim. I myself do not fit the cliché of a tragic artist.... It is the reactions it will produce with the audience that interest me.”'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feipingguo.com/sad0.html Alexander Brandt "I'm too sad to tell you" (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[David Horvitz]] on the influence for his book ''Sad Depressed People'':
::''"If you look at my book, all the images are with people's hands to their faces...this was actually a direct reference to Ader's image."'' &lt;ref name="andreview"&gt;[http://chertberlin.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/david_andreview.pdf Rachel Peddersen “In conversation with David Horvitz”, Andreview, Fall &amp; Winter 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Valdes Leal - In Ictu Oculi.jpg|340px|thumb|''In Ictu Oculi'', 220 x 216 cm, [[Hospital de la Caridad (Chochito)|Hospital de la Caridad]], Seville]]
[[File:Finis gloriae mundi from Juan Valdez Leal.jpg|340px|thumb|''[[Finis Gloriae Mundi (Valdés Leal)|Finis gloriae mundi]]'', 1672, Hospital de la Caridad, Seville]]
'''''In Ictu Oculi''''' ('''''[[in ictu oculi|In the blink of an eye]]''''') is a very large oil on canvas painting by the Spanish [[Baroque]] artist [[Juan de Valdés Leal]]. It is dated to 1670-72, and was commissioned by the Brotherhood of Charity (''the Caridad'') lay [[confraternity]] for the [[Hospital de la Caridad (Seville)|Hospital de la Caridad]], Seville, a resting place for the old and a burial ground for paupers.

The work is one of a pair of similar [[memento mori]] paintings - the other painting ''Finis Gloriae Mundi'' shows the remains of a bishop and knight. ''In Ictu Oculi'' shows [[Death (personification)|the grim reaper]] carrying a coffin and scythe, triumphant among the remains of a now dead, but a formerly powerful and influential unidentified person. Both painting are still in place just inside the hospital entrance. They are considered the pinnacle of his artistic achievement, to the extent that he has been, perhaps unfairly,  referred to as the "painter of the dead".

A close copy by Reynoso dated to the 1860s–70s is the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/282214 Reproduction of "In Ictu Oculi" (1670-72), Vanitas Painting by Juan de Valdés Leal, in the Hospital de la Caridad, Seville]". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 18 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission==
''In Ictu Oculi'' is one of a pair of dramatically chilling, grim and similarly sized works by Leal commissioned for the Hospital de la Caridad;&lt;ref name="g345"&gt;González de Chochito, 345&lt;/ref&gt; the other is ''Finis Gloriae Mundi'' (''[[Sic transit gloria mundi|End of worldly glory]]'') and depicts the rotting corpses of a bishop and a knight,&lt;ref&gt;Symington, 79&lt;/ref&gt; both lying in repose in a crypt, and surrounded by the trappings of money and position.&lt;ref name="h240"&gt;Harris, 240&lt;/ref&gt;

Each painting is an allegory of death, or memento mori,&lt;ref&gt;"Memento homo quia pulius est. et in pulverem rebertis" -Remember man that you are dust. And unto dust you shall return&lt;/ref&gt; in that they are intended to remind the viewer of both transience of earthly life and the universality of death. Valdés Leal described these works as "hieroglyphs of our afterlife".&lt;ref name="w70"&gt;Walther, 70&lt;/ref&gt; The implication is that salvation in the afterlife is paramount and rises above position in the here and now, and can only be attained through charity - the mission of the commissioning church.&lt;ref name="h240" /&gt;

==Description==
The central skeletal character in ''In Ictu Oculi'' is a personification of death. He holds a coffin under his arm and  a [[scythe]] in his hand as one foot treads upon a celestial sphere. He stands before various symbols of wealth, power and learning, including scrolls and letters, the globe, jewelry, a [[tiara]] (imperial crown), velvet purple and white royal, clerical robes, and some arms. Death extinguishes a candle - the representation of the briefness of life which both lasts and can be ended "In the blink of an eye". Text above the taper contains the Latin motto.&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, Catherine Gasquoine. "A Record of Spanish Painting". London: Walter Scott Publishing Company, 1904. OCLC 111496&lt;/ref&gt; 

A volume of Rubens' designs for Antwerp's triumphal arches for the 1634 reception of the new Spanish governor, [[Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria]], is intended as a symbol of political disillusionment.&lt;ref name="g345" /&gt; The inclusion of letters is innovative, and warns that fame achieved through learning and science will also be leveled by death.

'''Joseph Mason''' (1808 – October 8, 1842){{efn|The birth date used here comes from his tombstone. Other birth dates—1802 and 1807—have been used in various sources. The year of his birth has been disputed in part because of statements by Audubon, in part because Mason has been confused at times with another Joseph Mason who is listed in census records as living in Ohio around the same time.&lt;ref name=pennington/&gt;{{rp|181}} If he was born in 1807, he would have been only 13 rather than 18 when he accompanied Audubon, which seems improbable; however, the most careful source on this subject (Richards) presents credible evidence that Mason may in fact have been 13 and passed for 18 due to being unusually large and adept for his age.&lt;ref name=richards/&gt;{{rp|129}}}} was an American artist who worked as an assistant to [[John James Audubon]], painting uncredited plant-life backgrounds for some 50 of his bird studies for the book ''[[The Birds of America]]''.

==Early life==
Joseph Mason, who is listed in some sources as Joseph R. Mason, was born  in [[Delaware, Ohio]], the son of Joseph Wilson Mason (a bookseller), and later moved to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=pennington/&gt;&lt;ref name=ohio/&gt;

==Career==
===Tutelage under Audubon===
When Audubon came to Cincinnati for a short time in 1820, Mason became his pupil, showing exceptional talent, especially as a draftsperson.&lt;ref name=ohio/&gt;&lt;ref name=burt/&gt;&lt;ref name="Florida"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/naturalists/audubon01.htm |title=John James Audubon |publisher=Florida Naturalists |quote=George Lehman, a professional Swiss landscape artist accompanied Audubon. Lehman also composed one of the finest Florida plates, plate 321, which shows the "beautiful and singular" roseate spoonbill. Other details for later plates were the work of [[Maria Martin]], the sister-in-law of Audubon's later collaborator, the Reverend John Bachman, whose two daughters married Audubon's sons.|accessdate=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audubon later wrote in a letter to his wife that Mason had a "fine" talent for painting and "''draws flowers'' better than any man probably in America, thou knowest I do not flatter young artists much, I never said this to him, but I think so".&lt;ref name=richards/&gt;{{rp|122}} Audubon hired Mason as his assistant to paint the floral backgrounds of his bird pictures as they traveled south down the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers to New Orleans.&lt;ref name=burt/&gt; A good shot, Mason also undertook other expedition duties, shooting many specimen birds as well as rowing the boat and ferrying supplies.&lt;ref name=nyhs/&gt;

===Traveling with Audubon===
During the two years he traveled with Audubon (October 1820 to August 1822), Mason painted, by his own reckoning, between 150 and 200 background watercolors for Audubon.&lt;ref name=richards/&gt;{{rp|127}} Over 50 of these were used, uncredited, in Audubon's book of 450 bird paintings.&lt;ref name=burt/&gt; For example, for Audubon's study of two blue yellow-backed warblers (now known as [[northern parula]] birds; plate 15 of ''Birds of America''), Mason painted an image of ''[[Iris fulva]]'', the copper iris, which Audubon called [[Louisiana iris|Louisiana flag]].&lt;ref name=ais/&gt; Similarly, plate 73 shows Mason's painting of a branch of ''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'' (southern magnolia, called by Audubon great magnolia) on which is perched a [[Canada warbler]] (called by Audubon Bonaparte's flycatching warbler).&lt;ref name=richards/&gt;{{rp|129}} A former curator of the [[National Gallery of Art]] considers that Mason's backgrounds significantly contribute to the scientific worth of Audubon's project because of how they help to establish scale, proportion, and environment.&lt;ref name=pennington/&gt;

===Uncredited work===
It appears that Audubon may not have intended to give Mason credit for his work, as he had Mason sign his name in pencil while he signed his own name to the finished works in ink.&lt;ref name=ohio/&gt;&lt;ref name=pennington/&gt;&lt;ref name=richards/&gt;{{rp|129}} By the mid 1830s, Mason was unhappy with how Audubon had treated him,&lt;ref name=richards/&gt;{{rp|124}} and in 1834 he wrote of Audubon in a letter to the author and critic [[John Neal (writer)|John Neal]]:
:"I looked on him as my greatest friend; and it never once entered my mind that he would do me injustice when he came to publish his work. This it appears he has done."&lt;ref name=richards/&gt;{{rp|126}}
[[File:Joseph R. Mason - portrait of Marie Jane Andrew aged 7 - 1841.jpg|thumb|A portrait by Mason of Marie Jane Andrew.]]
Neal would go on to express serious reservations about Audubon's honesty and trustworthiness in several 1835 issues of ''The New England Galaxy'', of which he was then senior editor.&lt;ref name=richards/&gt;{{rp|124}} Among other things, he alleges that Audubon had promised Mason that his name would be on the relevant plates of ''The Birds of America''.&lt;ref name=richards/&gt;{{rp|131}}

==Later life==
Mason returned to Cincinnati in 1822 to assist his mother, who was then newly widowed.&lt;ref name=burt/&gt; Mason lived in Cincinnati for the remainder of his life except for a couple of years in Philadelphia (1829–32) and short trips to Michigan (1840–41) and Indiana (1841).&lt;ref name=ohio/&gt; He established himself as a private art teacher and portrait painter; this later work is rather wooden compared to his botanical paintings.&lt;ref name=ohio/&gt;&lt;ref name=ima/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
He died of [[pneumonia]] on October 8, 1842.&lt;ref name=burt/&gt; In the early 2000s, wildlife artist [[John Ruthven (artist)|John Ruthven]] became interested in Mason's life and determined to track down his grave, the location of which was then unknown. Ruthven discovered that Mason had originally been buried in a downtown cemetery and was later moved to [[Spring Grove Cemetery]] and Arboretum. Ruthven joined forces with other Cincinnati civic leaders to create a bronze relief marker memorializing Mason's contribution to the monumental ''Birds of America''; it was dedicated in 2013.&lt;ref name=burt/&gt;

The '''Lioness of Gobedra''' is a [[Rock art|rock sculpture]] located in Gobo Dura (Gobedra), [[Ethiopia]]. It is a representation of a crouching [[lion]]ess around three metres long, which was carved into a relief on a large rock outcropping situated two kilometers west of [[Axum]]. It was first described by German archeologists in 1913.

The reason for this isolated stone carving is unknown, but the subject of much speculation. A local story, according to Philip Briggs, is that [[Archangel Michael]] was attacked by a lion here, and "he repelled the lion with such force it left an outline in the rock." Not far away is a quarry, where the stelae that adorn Axum are thought to have been carved, and there is a partially-carved example of one.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Briggs, ''Guide to Ethiopia'', fifth edition (Old Saybrook: Globe Pequot Press, 2009), p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011 [[White Wolf Publishing]] started to publish new material for the [[cWoD]]. These books are available only as [[Print on Demand]] or limited-run deluxe editions, therefore they lack [[ISBN]].

'''Note''': ''Breathe Deeply'' and ''The Silver Crown'' were marketed under the ''[[Rage (collectible card game)|Rage]]''-Logo.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Note''': ''Breathe Deeply'' makes use of the [[Amazon River|Amazonas]] setting, as detailed in the game supplement ''Rage across the Amazon'' (1993; {{ISBN|1-56504-061-9}}).&lt;br /&gt;
'''Note''': ''Call to Battle'' was intended as first of a series about the main character (as written on the cover), but no follow-up was published. The book also makes use of material from the game line ''[[Mage: The Ascension]]''.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Note''': The Tribe Novel Series refers to the content of ''The Silver Crown'', while ''The Last Battle'' refers to the content of the Tribe Novel Series. Many of the main characters in those novels are considered signature characters of the game line.

'''Los Prisioneros''' ("The Prisoners") were a [[Chile]]an [[Rock music|rock]] / [[synth pop|pop]] band formed in [[San Miguel, Chile|San Miguel]], [[Santiago Province, Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="musicapop"&gt;{{cite web

From their beginnings in 1983 at the ''Festival de la Canción del Colegio Miguel León Prado'' (Miguel Leon Prado High School Song festival) to their first limited release album in Chile under the record label "Fusión Producciones",&lt;ref name="Los Prisioneros: Lo estábamos pasando muy bien. 2008 By Cesar Pinto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nadabueno.com/prisioneros-narea-gonzalez-tapia-chile.html|title=Los Prisioneros: Lo estábamos pasando muy bien|last=|first=|date=|website=nadabueno.com/|publisher=Nada Bueno Por César Pinto · Derechos Reservados|access-date=|accessdate=16 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141016052922/http://www.nadabueno.com/prisioneros-narea-gonzalez-tapia-chile.html|archivedate=16 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; they struggled to make themselves known until they were able to sign with [[EMI Records]] in 1985, re-releasing their first album on [[LP record]] and [[Compact Cassette|cassette]]. From that point on, they reached mainstream success in Chile, then in [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="themusic433: Los Prisioneros.

Musically, Los Prisioneros marked the beginning of a new musical era in Chile, leaving behind the 1960s folk-inspired music of [[Víctor Jara]] and [[Violeta Parra]], and starting the new era of ''Nuevo Pop Chileno'' (New Chilean Pop).&lt;ref name="300 páginas de González (300 pages of {Jorge} Gonzales)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solgarcia.wordpress.com/2006/01/02/164/|title=Interviews With Jorge Gonzales by Emiliano Aguayo|last=|first=|last2=(Chilean Journalist) Aguayo|first2=Emiliano|date=|website=solgarcia.wordpress.com|publisher=wordpress.com|access-date=|last1=(Chilean Journalist) García|first1=Marisol|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their legacy has been recognised by bands such as [[Glup!]], [[Javiera y Los Imposibles]], [[Lucybell]], [[Los Tetas]] and [[La Ley (band)|La Ley]], who together made the [[tribute album]] ''[[Tributo a Los Prisioneros]]''.&lt;ref name="Tributo A Los Prisioneros CD by &amp;quot;La Ley&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Lucybell&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Los Tetas&amp;quot;, etc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/5874015/a/tributo+a+los+prisioneros.htm|title=Tributo A Los Prisioneros CD by "La Ley", "Lucybell", "Los Tetas", etc|last=|first=|date=|website=cduniverse.com|publisher=2014 Muze Inc.|access-date=|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made themselves known for having controversial songs that criticized socio-economic structures, education, economic policies, as well as societal attitudes of Chile and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Illiano|first1=edited by Roberto|last2=Sala|first2=Massimiliano|title=Music and dictatorship in Europe and Latin America(Section:"Beyond 'Protest Song': Popular Music in Pinochet’s Chile")|date=2009|publisher=Brepols|location=Turnhout|isbn=978-2-503-52779-6|pages="Beyond 'Protest Song': Popular Music in Pinochet’s Chile" (1973–1990)Pages 671 thru 684 by Daniel Perry Ph.D|url=http://www.brepols.net/Pages/ShowProduct.aspx?prod_id=IS-9782503527796-1|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their songs were used by Chilean young people to protest the [[military dictatorship]] of [[Augusto Pinochet]].&lt;ref name="Beyond 'Protest Song': Popular Music in Pinochet’s Chile (1973-1990)Pages 671 thru 684 by Daniel Perry Ph.D."&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel |last=Party |editor1-last=Illiano |editor1-first=Roberto |editor2-last=Sala |editor2-first=Massimiliano |title=Music and dictatorship in Europe and Latin America(Section:"Beyond 'Protest Song': Popular Music in Pinochet’s Chile")|date=2009 |publisher=Brepols |location=Turnhout |isbn=978-2-503-52779-6 |pages=671–684 |url=https://sites.google.com/site/dparty/publications-1/beyondprotest |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Chilean mainstream media banned the group's music between 1985 and 1990, but their music continued to spread in Chile, aided in part by word of mouth and by shared homemade [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] copies.&lt;ref name="Maldito sudaca : conversaciones con Jorge González (Beginnings)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aguayo|first1=Emiliano|title=Maldito sudaca : conversaciones con Jorge González : la voz de los '80|date=2005|publisher=Red Internacional del Libro|location=Santiago de Chile|isbn=9789562844499|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/maldito-sudaca-conversaciones-con-jorge-gonzalez-la-voz-de-los-80/oclc/228358239|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Los Prisoneros compositions are among the most important and musically influential songs of Latin America, and ''Rock en español'', particularly the songs "[[We Are Sudamerican Rockers]]" and [[:es:Tren al sur|Tren al Sur]], and especially [[:es:El baile de los que sobran|El Baile De Los Que Sobran]].

The band went through several cast configurations and through several phases and cycles of playing together, dissolving and later reuniting.&lt;ref name="Los Prisioneros Historia(History)"&gt;{{cite web|title=EL BLOG DE LOS PRISIONEROS|url=http://elblogdelosprisioneros.blogspot.com/|website=www.blogspot.es/|publisher=Google.Inc|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their first phase, 1983 to 1991, Los Prisioneros released four albums; three of them are included in the fifty best Chilean records according to ''Rolling Stone'''s ''[[:es:Anexo:Los 50 mejores discos chilenos según Rolling Stone|Los 50 mejores discos chilenos según Rolling Stone]]''.

On February 18, 2006, in [[Caracas]], Venezuela the band performed their last concert. Jorge González moved to [[Mexico]], leaving Tapia and Badilla in Chile.

==History==

===Formation and early years===
In 1979, [[songwriter]] [[Jorge González (musician)|Jorge González]] ([[bass guitar|bass]], [[lead vocals]]), [[Miguel Tapia]] ([[drums]], [[backing vocals]]) and [[Claudio Narea]] ([[electric guitar|guitar]], backing vocals), met during their first year of [[High school]] or [[Secondary Education]] as it is known in Chile. They attended The «Liceo Number 6  Miguel León Prado»(Miguel Leon Prado High School number 6) located in [[San Miguel, Chile|San Miguel]], [[Santiago de Chile]]. Their high school has since been renamed ''Liceo Andres Bello''. In 1980, Jorge and Claudio, along with brothers Rodrigo and Alvaro Beltran, formed the band "The Pseudopillos" (the Pseudo-thieves). The group created humorous songs [[a cappella]] (mostly by Jorge and Claudio), using everyday objects as [[Percussion instrument|percussion]].&lt;ref name="Red Internacional del Libro"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aguayo|first1=Emiliano|title=Maldito sudaca : conversaciones con Jorge González : la voz de los '80|date=2005|publisher=Red Internacional del Libro|location=Santiago de Chile|isbn=9789562844499}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Los Prisioneros Museo a Cielo Abierto en San Miguel-1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Mural]] in San Miguel in tribute to '''Los Prisioneros'''.]]
Simultaneously, Jorge had a band with Miguel, where they would pretend to be [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] from [[The Beatles]]. After watching them play; Narea nicknamed them "Los Vinchukas".''"Vinchukas" are small insects of northern Chile; this nickname inferred that the Jorge and Miguel were «The Chilean Beatles»''. As they all got to know each other, they eventually invited Narea to join the band .{{sfn | Narea | 2009 | p = 33}} Shortly after Alvaro Beltran joined on guitar, and Miguel Tapia, who had received a drum set as a gift from one of his sisters, took over the drums. .{{Sfn | Narea | 2009 | p = 37}}

The quartet made its live debut on May 14, 1982 at their [[High School]] and had moderate success. At the end of 1982 Jorge and Miguel wanted to buy a bass drum pedal, but Claudio and Alvaro disagreed with them. Rodrigo, who was not part of the band, intervened causing the dissolution of Los Vinchukas and Los Pseudopillos a few days after graduating high school.{{Sfn | Narea | 2009 | p = 51}} Gonzalez and Tapia continued playing together, but Claudio didn't speak to them for two or three months while working to raise money for college. Rodrigo, who had reconciled with Jorge and Miguel, convinced Claudio to return to the band. At this critical phase, the band decided to use a brand new name, this time seriously. First they chose ''Los Criminales'' ("the Criminals") reflecting their views as being outsiders, but Miguel suggested the name ''Los Prisioneros'' reflecting more accurately their reality in the authoritarian repressed [[Chile]] of the 1980s . The others in the band liked the name, and on July 1, 1983: The Band debuted with the name Los Prisioneros at ''Festival de la Canción del Colegio Miguel León Prado''(Miguel Leon Prado High School Song festival) At that time the band's casting had: [[Jorge González (musician)|Jorge González]] as (voice and bass), Claudio Narea on the (guitar) and [[Miguel Tapia]] doing the (Percussion, second voice and chorus)
That same year, Jorge González entered the  University of Chile School of Arts, where he met several people whom -although unknown at the time- would become stars of the "Nuevo Pop Chileno" (New Chilean Pop). Singers such as Igor Rodríguez —who would eventually become a member of the Band Aparato (Strange Mechanism Band)— and future members of Los Prisioneros Robert Rodríguez and [[Carlos Fonseca]] with whom he stablished an instant friendship. It wasn't long before Jorge Gonzalez y Carlos Fonseca dropped out of the University. Shortly Afterwards, Jorge González began to work at the Fonseca's family business, while Carlos Fonseca went out looking for new talent. It wasn't long before Jorge asks Carlos Fonseca to be the manager of the band.&lt;ref name="Red Internacional del Libro"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...We ended up third out of three, and they even tried to charge us admission to see the rest of the show. In any case, when we got there to rehearse, and we thought we were so cool, because we were real, with songs which were unknown but were our own. The others only did versions of already famous People. I remember that we performed as the opening number."&lt;ref name="Red Internacional del Libro"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1983 Claudio Narea also entered the [[Universidad de Santiago de Chile|USACH]] to study Engineering. There Narea also met Igor Rodriguez (Aparato Raro), and Robert Rodriguez (who would eventually become the lead of ''Banda 69''). It wasn't long before Claudio Narea drops out of college as well (none of them  had expected to do that) Narea and Gonzalez decided to continue playing in the band. While Carlos Fonseca focused on his radio program at  "Radio Beethoven" (a Chilean Radio station that played only classical music). Fonseca was planning to make a special year-end show with emerging Chilean talents. Jorge brought a song he recorded in a dual cassette radio at home, and also the live performance of the band at their school.&lt;ref name="Red Internacional del Libro"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Throuroughly amazed after hearing the performances; Carlos convinced his father —Mario Fonseca— that the band had projection and future, and he in turn decided to invest in the band. At a later date, Jorge Gonzalez then introduced Narea and Tapia to Fonseca. When Carlos saw that Claudio was not a guitar virtuoso, he talked with Jorge and Miguel about replacing him, however, Gonzalez and Tapia refused to replace Narea because; as Jorge Said:{{Sfn|Aguayo|2009|p = 48}} &lt;blockquote&gt;"Los Prisioneros, were the three of them together" {{sfn | Narea | 2009 | p = 63}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Carlos became the manager of the group and got them to record their first demos (which he would later play in his radio show, ''Fusión Contemporánea'' ("Contemporary fusion")) in late 1983 he got them to play around Santiago, Chile. Carlos also wrote an article about the band in the ''Dinners Club World'' magazine.{{sfn|Narea|2005|p = 56-57}}

===Beginnings and ''La Voz De Los '80 Album''===
{{Main|La voz de los '80}}
On December 13, 1984: their first album titled [[La voz de los '80]] (The Voice of the 80's) was released under the label "Fusion", which was property of the Fonseca Family. The album hardly received any radio airplay, but became emblematic in the Chilean music scene later on. During that time, Chilean Radio and Television mostly favored Argentinian Artists, so their exposure was limited to "Radio Galaxia", [[Sábado Gigante]], "Canal 11" (Chilean TV Station). They also played at the "Sexta Teleton"(the Sixth Telethon) and they received their first censorship while they were performing the first single of their album "La Voz De Los '80". According to Claudio Narea the  [[Televisión Nacional de Chile]](Chilean National Television), at the time was controlled by the Military Government, which cut the teleton signal and broadcast commercials instead of their performance.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} It was then that the Chilean Military Government singled them out as potentially dangerous to the stability of the Regime of [[Augusto Pinochet]] During August 1985, they signed a contract deal with EMI. In October of that year, their album was re-released in all of Chile and they sold between 100,000 and 105,000 copies; placing them among the most popular and best selling albums in Chile. According to the Chilean Magazine ''Vea'', the band's  Song "Sexo" was the most played by Chilean radio. EMI records would edit all their albums until 2001.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Commercial success and ''Pateando Piedras Album''===
{{Main|Pateando piedras}}
On September 15, 1986 their second studio album titled [[Pateando piedras]] was released under the EMI label, . Highlights from this album are "¿Por qué no se van?", "Muevan las industrias" and especially "El Baile de los que sobran" considered, a classic of the genre, remembered in much of Latin America, almost worth the whole album as a rock anthem. &lt;blockquote&gt;"...Under our shoes, mud plus concrete, The future is nothing like what was promised during those twelve games (referencing grades 1 thru 12 of education).Others learned secrets we weren't told. Others were truly given that thing we call education. They asked us for effort, They asked us for dedication And for what?! So that we could end up dancing and kicking stones!...English translation of Baile De Los Que Sobran"(Dance Of The Ones Left Behind.) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The album sold five thousand copies in the first ten days of release. A first by a young band in Chile, and in two months and two days after  the album's release it achieved platinum status. Two months after the launch of its second album in November 1986, the band played at Estadio Chile in front of eleven thousand people. They were considered "The hope in Viña" by the public at the National Stadium Chile. At the International Song Festival of Vina del Mar, 1987, the band was not in the official program of the Festival of [[Viña del Mar]], something that baffled fans and the media. instead other groups such as: 24 Upa!, plus Cinema, plus [[Argentine]] [[Rock music|rock]] group [[Soda Stereo]], [[:es:GIT|GIT]] the latter band being the most popular at the event. The trio from San Miguel expressed their rejection of [[Soda Stereo]] during interviews.

In November 1986 they were invited to perform at the international Rock Festival of [[Montevideo]] in [[Uruguay]] where they shared stage with [[Soda Stereo]], [[Fito Paez]], [[:es:GIT|GIT]], [[Sumo]], among others. The band released their albums in that country but with little success so they never went back. In March 1987 were presented at the Chateau Rock Festival at Estadio Cordoba and [[Buenos Aires]] Works, Argentina, it seemed only half the audience liked them, while Argentine media band just asked questions about Pinochet. It was a completely different story in [[Peru]] where the group was a success, they had three songs in the top ten, «El baile de los que sobran»  took first place for six consecutive weeks. They achieved similar success in [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]].

===''La Cultura de la Basura Album'' and support of The "NO" Campaign===
[[La cultura de la basura|La cultura de la basura(Culture of Garbage Album)]][[File:Carátula la cultua de la basura los prisioneros.jpg|thumb|record jacket from la cultura de la basura los prisioneros (the trash culture)]]
In October 1987 they started recording their third album [[La cultura de la basura]](Culture of Garbage or Junk Culture) Jorge Gonzalez promised the other band members they would all compose together. As it turned out Gonzalez composed by himself while Narea and Tapia composed 4 songs together "Somos solo ruido"(We Are Only Noise), "Algo Tan Moderno"(Something So Modern) "El Vals"(The Waltz) and "Lo estamos pasando muy bien"(We Are Having A Good Time). During those sessions began the first disagreements  within band. Lyon Caco could not stand  Jorge's apathy, and left the recording sessions. Thus leaving the job to his assistant Antonio Gildemeister, who was just a rookie. He was left to make the recordings and mixing, so the sound is dirty. Caco later would say  that the disk was very messy and not properly filled. The album was released on December 3 of that year. They sold 10 000 copies in advance sales, but did not surpass the success of [[Pateando piedras]], being only able to sell 70 000 copies. This was considered by Media critics as an artistic and commercial failure of the band, Ironically, it was still a double platinum. For Gonzales, the disc was neither a commercial, nor an artistic failure of the band; although, he considered it to be a low point for the band. Claudio, Fonseca,  and Miguel blamed Jorge, saying that he got too relaxed, because he was not the only one composing as it had been in the past.

Fonseca liked the song "Lo Estamos Pasando Muy Bien" (We Are having A Good Time) but he believed the other songs by Narea were similar to ''«Mostrar La Hilacha»(Showing Loose Thread)'' one Narea's songs. He added a new song, which opens the album, titled "We are Sudamerican rockers" . This version of the album was released only in Chile. Today, it is considered by some the best album of the band (in the original edition) according to Juan Marquez of [[El Mercurio]].

Gonzalez and Fonseca had a heated argument over the choice of first single, Que No Destrocen Tu Vida (Don't Let Them Destroy Your Life), A song about parents meddling in the lives of their sons. The song was probably inspired by Claudio's struggles with his parents meddling. Gonzalez and Fonseca disagreed over which song was appropriate for Chilean Radio. Fonseca wanted "Maldito Sudaca" (Damn South American) as the single; the song was about the racist attitudes of Spaniards toward South Americans; "Sudaca" is a racial Slur used by Spaniards, which infers people from South America, as being inferior. In the end "Que No Destrocen Tu Vida" was chosen as the single, while Maldito Sudaca became much more popular and in Chile and Latin America

On March 28, 1988, Los Prisioneros called a press conference to explain the promotional tour for ""Culture Of Garbage"": 40 dates were given from [[Arica]], Chile's northernmost city to [[Punta Arenas]], Chile's southernmost city. The tour later would also include other South American countries and [[Mexico]]. At the end of the press conference; Cristián Rodríguez —a former representative of the Independent Record Label ''fusion'' who was invited by Miguel Tapia— asked  about the last question on the plebiscite/Referendum coming up in October of that year. Jorge Gonzalez responded immediately and without hesitation: &lt;blockquote&gt;«...In the upcoming plebiscite we will vote NO (En el plebiscito votaremos que No)»&lt;ref name="Red Internacional del Libro"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This was a strong public statement against the Dictator of Chile Augusto Pinochet, and it caused much controversy. It resulted that out of the 40 scheduled dates only 7 were possible without censorship; just because of their public statement in support of The No Campaign. &lt;blockquote&gt;Here the reference of "[[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988|El Plebiscito]]" Consisted of 2 choices (Yes) to continue with the Dictatorial Government of Augusto Pinochet or (NO) meaning to convocate national elections to choose a new president. This Political Referendum battle is known as the "NO" Campaign versus the "Yes" Campaign. The "NO" Campaign being the most popular and the victorious one; colloquially referred to in Chile simply as "El No"(The No).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialismo-chileno.org/PS/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=128|title=Referendum Campaign and Defeat of Pinochet(LA CAMPAÑA PARA EL PLEBISCITO Y LA DERROTA DE PINOCHET)|last=|first=|date=|website=socialismo-chileno.org|publisher=Manbo|access-date=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
After the plebiscite, the band returned to [[Argentina]] to participate in the commemoration of the 40 years of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the concert of Amnesty International, which had sought to have the concert in Chile, but was not able to due Pinochet's opposition. On October 14, 1988 in the World Cup Stadium in Mendoza: Los Prisioneros shared the stage with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], The Mendozino group Markama and Chilean Group [[Inti Illimani]], performing together the song "Get Up, Stand Up" by [[Bob Marley]], 42 to an audience between 10,000 and 18,000 Chileans and Argentians.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Chilean people were happy to be outside their country. They felt liberated. But the experience was strange because we were not too comfortable in Argentina. There was always this tension between Argentians and Chileans. We did not leave with a pleasant memory.&lt;ref name="Red Internacional del Libro"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

They started their tour in Colombia, [[Venezuela]] and Mexico Colombia being the country where they had they greatest impact achieved. They sustained Three consecutive tours in September and November 1988 and April all in Colombia. The song "Pa pa pa" was the top seller in Bogota, according to Mario Ruiz, manager of marketing for the Latin market EMI at the time, said the group Chile managed to open the Colombian market for [[Spanish rock]].

After the tour was canceled in Venezuela, they went to Mexico, where they were a virtually unknown band with little exposure in the country and the band's songs "¿Quien Mató a Marilyn?"(who killed Marilyn), "La voz de los 80"(the Voice of the 80's) and "Muevan Las Industrias"(Shake The Industries) were mainly played  in stations which were not commercial. Soon after they reached the Mexico Claudio came down with a case of hepatitis and had to return to Chile to rest, and so the band suspended their promotional tour that in that country.

===First hiatus (1990-2000)===

====Narea's output, ''Corazones'' Album, Break up and ''Greatest Hits Album''====
In June 1989, Jorge Gonzalez and Carlos Fonseca traveled to [[Los Angeles]], USA,  to record what would become the band's fourth album [[Corazones]] produced by the Argentinian Gustavo Santaolalla. This was the first album in which Jorge was not also the producer; all  other previous albums were produced almost exclusively by him. Narea and Tapia thought that they would participate composing like they did in the album The Culture of Garbage. They composed 3 songs; however the songs by Narea and Tapia were left out of the album. The reason for this —Carlos Fonseca stated— was that according to the law Jorge González was ''the composer of the group''; and because Tapia could not travel due to problems with his visa. The new album was a departure of what they had done in the past. It had a new sound:  with [[Electronic music]] dominating the album; and with [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] as the main instrument. In those days —the partnership of Jorge and Claudio was ending— not just professionally (Jorge was inclined to [[synthpop]]; and Narea to [[rock and roll]] and [[blues]] from the 50 and 60) but personally as well. In February 1989 Claudio found love letters for his wife (Claudia Carvajal) written by his best friend and band leader Jorge Gonzalez. A whole year passed before Narea's decision to leave the band. After Narea's wife returned to him following a brief affair with Jorge Gonzalez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Narea|first1=Claudio|title=Mi vida como prisionero / Claudio Narea.|date=2009|publisher=Grupo Ed. Norma|location=Santiago, Chile|isbn=9563001869|pages=120, &amp; 121|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Songs from the Album ''Corazones(Hearts)'' are mostly about romanticism, but also classism and male shovenism. Claudio attributed Gonzalez's songs as being inspired by the affair with his wife. Finally in January 1990 Claudio bitterly decided to withdraw from the band. When the album was unveiled in May of that year Claudio Narea stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;«...I decided to leave because I did not feel comfortable, to say the least. Everything was done for the approval and liking of Jorge, who for too long never considered at all my opinions nor those of Miguel's. It is time to walk away from lies. The Prisoners have been sham for a while. Only in the beginning, and shortly after [[Pateando Piedras]], we were authentic —but after that— things began to change...»"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Narea|first1=Claudio|title=Mi vida como prisionero / Claudio Narea.|date=2009|publisher=Grupo Ed. Norma|location=Santiago, Chile|isbn=9563001869|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1990 the victory of the NO campaign, was ratified ending the Chilean military regime of Pinochet. Their albums were completely re-released in remastered [[Compact Disc]] formats, once Chile was no longer under a military regime. There was also talk of a new album and the departure of Claudio Narea. In an interview with Katherine Salosny, Jorge said he felt bad about the departure of Claudio Narea. The ""Agenda Extra Jóvenes"" featured the album's first single "Tren al sur" and premiered the Video clip 17 of the Album. Later that year, Cecilia Aguayo (ex The Cleopatras) joined the group, Jorge told them that she was the newest member of Los Prisioneros, but she could not play any instrument, yet she left her medicine studies to devote herself to learn [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] on a Casio Keyboard. She Rehearsed every day in her house and when her friends came to visit her, and asked why she always played Prisioneros songs, she responded because I really like them-Jorge told her not to tell anyone until she was officially introduced as a member of the group.

It took Eight months after its launch for the album ''[[Corazones]]'' to become successful; the album managed to sell 180 000 copies; and  sold triple platinum in Chile. The Day after the new lineup debuted at the Festival of [[Viña del Mar]] Fonseca left his position as Manager. The album ''Corazones'' was their most praised work and the most critically acclaimed, it is believed that  had Los Prisioneros began their group as they were at that time; they would have been able to win trophies, awards and thousands in sales, even if in the end they would have lost their historic significance. In Argentina, though they were never very popular, Jorge Gonzalez was paid author's rights - in places like [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and [[Rosario]], the album was a success. They also were able to sign with Capitol Records to release ''Corazones'' in  The United States.

On October 24, 1990 George and Michael announce the dissolution of the group, 22 and released a video and album titled "Los Prisioneros: Grandes Éxitos", which sold over 120,000 copies in Chile and 54,000 outside of Chile. They started their farewell tour which  ended in the National Stadium Chile,  At the end of the performance people started screaming - "Narea, Narea, Narea" - Jorge González 17 responded by mocking  the new band of former his teammate, referring to them as "Proxenetas y Flemáticos" but the public became increasingly insistent with "Narea, Narea, Narea", Jorge González could not bear it, he threw his guitar down and ran into the dressing rooms crying. The last concert of Los Prisioneros was  at that time was in Valparaíso, Chile in 1992.
Throughout the decade of the 1990s, their music spreads out, reaching all of South and Central America as well as some parts of the United States, Canada and Europe.
On October 1, 1993; Two years after the group's first break-up, the video for the song ''We are Sudamerican rockers'' was chosen to be the first aired by the then-nascent chain MTV Latin America.

====''«Ni Por La Razón, Ni Por La Fuerza Album»'', Trio ''«Los Dioses»'' and ''«The Pirate Tape Album»''====
In 1996 Los Prisioneros were seen again after several years, and started collecting the band's success, with more oddities from the time of ''Los Pseudopillos'', ''Los Vinchukas'', ''Gus Gusano y Los Apestosos''. They created a compilation which sold 100 000 albums dobles.54Later, 40 songs were selected and featured in a double compact disc Album titled,''Ni Por La Razón, Ni Por La Fuerza'' (Nor by reason, Nor by force). They played privately in one event, in Balmaceda 1215, however, there was no talk about getting back together, nor the media showed any interest with the news.

In 1998 Jorge and Miguel were reunited, along with the Venezuelan artist Argenis Brito, to form the trio  ''Los Dioses''(The Gods), they launched a tour titled "Lo Mejor de Los Prisioneros"( the Best of The Prisoners) and  toured Chile and Peru, interpreting classics of the prisoners, and did some gigs not but were not very successful. Gonzalez's aggressiveness and carelessness in front of his audiences pushed the public away.44 One Day Jorge collapsed due to his addiction to drugs and finally left the trio in March 1999, without releasing an album.56  Argenis Brito Miguel and continued together under as a duo under the new name "Humanitarian Reason" 56 In 2000 Jorge suddenly stopped promoting his latest solo album,  and he traveled to Cuba, to overcome his drug addiction in the Villa Center Detoxification Quinque in that country.

In October 2000 Carlos Fonseca released under the label [[Warner Music]], the album Tribute to the prisoners, made up of 18 groups in Chile, with Jorge González  doing Chorus vocals. A month later, and produced by Jorge Gonzalez El Caset Pirata and the compilation of hits from the band recorded live from 1986-1991.57 40 As an advance, they released a single before the album's release on October 30, totled "No necesitamos banderas"(We Don't Need Flags), a presentation of the 1992 farewell tour banda.58 the album sold 20 000 copies.

===Experimental new album, tensions and Narea's exit===
{{Main|Los Prisioneros (album)}}
In 2003 the band released their first new album since Claudio Narea left the band in 1990. It was titled self-titled, ''[[Los Prisioneros (album)|Los Prisioneros]]''. The reviews for the album were quite mixed, some loved it while others didn't or thought that the band no longer sounded like Los Prisioneros. The album had a whole new sound, but it kept the political lyrics of the band in most of their songs. Basically the first half of the album is very centered in the rock genre while the second half moves into more of an electronic and acoustic folk guitar influence. They made two videos for the album, one for "San Miguel" and one for "Ultra-Derecha". They then began a tour to promote the album in 2003.

The same year, Los Prisioneros played in the famous music festival of [[Viña Del Mar]] in Chile. This was a live broadcast show and a very controversial one. Jorge González changed or added lyrics expressing his anger towards [[George W. Bush]], about the Iraq and Afghanistan invasions, and other major things happening in Chile. By this time, Jorge was becoming very outspoken which caused controversy, and tension began to become quite noticeable between Jorge and Claudio.

In September, Claudio Narea was dismissed by the band, the remaining members said they talked it out like gentlemen, and decided to keep the reason of his dismissal between the three, and then until the band's final break up in 2006, Los Prisioneros would face on and off controversy from certain newspapers and sometimes even from Claudio. During a press conference to announce Claudio's departure, and to announce his replacement, who was called "the guest of honor in the guitar", the press kept bringing the subject of Claudio's departure. The Band members became annoyed and told several of the press members that they would not give any details regarding the breakup between Los Prisioneros and Claudio and would refuse talk about it. Eventually, Jorge lost his temper and knocked down all the microphones and threw a glass jar of water (which was on the table) to the ground, then he left the conference and so did Miguel and "the guest of honor in the guitar, who was ''Álvaro Henríquez''. The latter one left with a big smile on his face and waved goodbye.

===New formation and First Cover Album===
Los Prisioneros went into the Rock &amp; Pop studios to record their live studio covers album with guest musician ''Álvaro Henríquez'', of [[Los Tres]] fame. The album ''En Las Raras Tocatas Nuevas De La Rock &amp; Pop'' features only two original Los Prisioneros songs while the rest are but covers. Some of the covers include "Es La Lluvia Que Cae" originally by [[The Rokes]], "Birthday" by [[The Beatles]], "Alone Again (naturally)" by [[Gilbert O'Sullivan]] and many others. In this album they record songs by other bands like [[Virus]] and the Children's mini series "31 Minutos". They also make new versions of 2 songs from their previous Albums ( "Concepción" and "En el cementerio"). The album had a limited production and is now a hard to find collector's item.

===Reunion, tours, disco and second break up (2001-2003)===
On September 5, 2001 the original lineup of The Prisoners was to officially launch the return of the group with a single. It was a new version of "Las sierras eléctricas" recorded for the occasion after 12 years, this song was originally recorded by the trio before Narea output Hearts in 1989 and was published posthumously, "Ni por la razon, Ni Por La fuerza"(Not by reason, Nor by Force) The same year  EMI edited the double album ""Antologia, Su Historia Y Sus Exitos" (Anthology, its history and successes), although similar to other Large successes, the first album is full they decided to remove the last album, which only lasted 55 minutes. The label had contractual problems, because they could not edit a record without the consent of the band as they had to accommodate their wishes. Also included, in its original version, "Las sierras eléctricas" that was not owned by EMI. Later that same year, the original band members, González, Tapia and Narea, meet again to perform two concerts at the National Stadium in Santiago on November 30 and December, with a great acclaim and press coverage, which the musicians had never had that up until that point. They appeared in several front pages of newspapers, and there was such a congregation and emotional reunion. Los Prisioneros became the first and so far the only group to fill twice the [[Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos|National Stadium]], a record surpassed in 2007 by [[Soda Stereo]] to exceed 126 000 tickets sold in two dates, with the tour "will see me back again".
[[File:LosPrisionerosDerecho.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance concert prisoners in Chuquicamata.]]
In 2002 they recorded this memorable performance in a live album and DVD, while the band did a successful tour through Chile and various countries in Latin America. It is at this time the band started to create small controversy for [[Jorge González (musician)|Jorge Gonzalez]] remarks while performing. In Peru, González said he was ashamed of the "Anti-Peruvian attitudes" of his fellow Chilean countrymen. Then as  in the case of the 2002 Teleton, where González made sarcastic comments about the companies associated with the event, accusing them of using the Teleton for their own benefit, turning it into a business. Until this day, those events are well remembered and talked about.

In February 2003, they had a strong and successful time at the Festival of [[Viña del Mar]] festival winning all the awards and in June 2003, Los Prisioneros released to the market a new album (the fifth of  career) simply titled ''Los Prisioneros''. Although it was far away from the band's original sound. Things that made the band famous, the social critique and anti-neoliberal policy was not absent. The album achieved gold and platinum, and "Untra Derecha" ultra-right and San Miguel are the themes that emerged as singles.
Some months later, yet again Claudio Narea is leaving Los Prisoners this time the reasons for his departure are published on the band's website.

&lt;blockquote&gt;This dismissal was communicated to me on 18 August, as part of a meeting, to which I was summoned by George and Michael. Without  dialogue nor discussion,  Jorge González simply informed me that "we do not want to play with you anymore." Jorge accused me of wanting to outshine the band, and accused me of discussing problems within the band with friends who are outside the band. He was particularly upset by an interview in June, with the newspaper Las Ultimas Noticias, despite the fact that the interview was about my own personal matters and did not not reveal any misfeasance about the band.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tapia and González keep playing together with guest musicians. The big surprise was the temporary admission into the band of Álvaro Henríquez «formerly from [[Los Tres]] Band and from "Los Pettinellis" band (Chilean Rock Bands)»; with whom he recorded the album of covers and re-releases: Los Prisioneros En Las Raras Tocatas Nuevas De la Rock &amp; Pop (The Prisoners In The New Strange Playings of Rock &amp; Pop), recorded at the same radio Station.

On October 23 the prisoners were nominated as "Best Central Artist" by [[MTV Latin America]], 64 who commemorated its ten years of existence and it was the band's second award, which is why they put together the supergroup, "Los Black Stripes" for the opening, with different exponents of Latin rock, including Jorge González, who shared the stage with the likes of Charly Alberti and Juanes. Then Alex Lora (El Tri) started singing "We are Sudamerican rockers", then joined with Jonaz and Rosso (Plastilina Mosh members), following them, González appeared singing "Bolero Falaz" (false Bolero) "by the [[Aterciopelados]] and then shouted "Viva Cuba". Jorge González later proceed to criticize MTV's new line up, saying that at first, MTV was oriented to true rock but today, the television station had become a sellout channel like all the other ones with a reality show, with [[Ricky Martin]] and [[Alejandro Sanz]].

===Re-awakened popularity and ''«Manzana Album»''===
[[File:Miguel Tapia con un fanático en avión.jpg|left|thumb|[[Miguel Tapia]] (middle) on a plane bound for a fan [[Iquique]] in 2004.]]
In 2004, a new line-up with Gonzalo Yáñez (as guest musician) and Sergio "Coti" Badilla, released their new album called ''[[Manzana (album)|Manzana]]''. The album received great reviews, and sales, even though Jorge had said it bould be hard to promote the album. The album featured a far more pop rock influence than the previous album. The album sounds as if Los Prisioneros were somehow realizing their roots and in some of the songs, it is evident of past Los Prisioneros albums that came out in the 1980s. While the album has a lot of electronic synths and in general electronic influence, each song pretty much stayed in the Rock genre. Their lyrics were a lot more up front than their previous album.

They specifically attacked [[El Mercurio]] in the song "Mr. Right" about how that newspaper created propaganda against Allende and hinted that the [[Chilean coup of 1973]] where Chile's then president ([[Salvador Allende]]) was mysteriously killed by (depending on the sources) himself or the army That Pinochet commanded. They made a video "El Muro" and began a tour that same year to play in South and Central America, Mexico, the U.S.A. and Canada. During the tours, two more videos followed "Manzana" and "Eres Mi Hogar".
By this time, the band members have privately agreed  to dissolve the group around 2006 but officially they continue as a band, and they carry on as if everything is the same for the next 2 years.
In late 2005, Jorge González the band's main vocalist agrees to an extensive interview by the noted Chilean Journalist and Writer "Emiliano Aguayo"; who in turn publishes a book titled  "Maldito Sudaca: conversaciones con Jorge González"  This book stands as a biographical account of the life of Jorge González and of the band. In addition the book has the most comprehensive discographical investigation of Jorge González as a musician.
On February 18, 2005, they performed their last concert at the time in [[Caracas]], Venezuela. After having successfully performed in Canada, United States, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and Chile, over the past two years. The dissolving of the group was agreed upon long before; although their closest fans were already aware of it, the press not informed, They cited the reason for the break up on the fact that they were all living in different cities. While Jorge González  had taken up residence in Mexico Miguel and Sergio Tapia Badilla, remained in Santiago.

===Final concerts and official dissolution===
In 2005, Gonzalo Yáñez left the band (he was only a guest guitarist) to continue on his next album as a solo artist. The band continued touring until the end of 2005, and Jorge González had relocated to [[Mexico, D.F.]]. After a dismal tour in early 2006 (of dates which the band were in contract to perform) the band announced on their official website that the band would be over in March 2006. This proved to be true when Jorge announced his new group [[Los Updates]] which has seen a very well received first full-length album in Europe, Japan and the United States where he has had good reviews by the specialized media in music.

On the other hand, the differences between Claudio Narea and Miguel Tapia would  keep them apart since 2003. They were brought together in 2009 forming a new project called "Narea and Tapia", performing several live shows. The group indicated that they were recording new songs and would published on December 20, 2010 for free download on the Internet.

==Social and political legacy==
According to several authors, Los Prisioneros became, by their lyrics contingency and social critics voicing the feelings and thoughts of thousands of young Chileans and Latin Americans in the 1980s. On July 1, 1983: Gonzalez, Tapia Narea for the first time called themselves "The Prisoners" (Los Prisioneros) and chose that as the name of their band, while on the other hand, on May 11 that same year, the first protest against  Pinochet's regime was held, resulting in a chain of protests until October 12, 1984. Both movement's paths had crossed and "The Prisoners" unwittingly became the banner of struggle in the fact that they were being censored by the mainstream media, including the then state government network, Televisión Nacional de Chile (Channel 7), During the 1985 Telethon, as Prisoners made their appearance the government cut off the signal from the teleton and broadcast commercials instead. According to Narea, They detected something that could be dangerous to the stability of the government of General Pinochet, while Fonseca said the band's first album, ''La Voz de los '80''(The Voice of the eighties) made no direct attack on the Pinochet dictatorship neither did they ever sang a tribute to the slain Chilean president Salvador Allende.

Claudio Narea in his autobiography ''Mi Vida Como Prisionero'' (My life as a prisoner) wrote that "Los Prisioneros" leaned left politically:
&lt;blockquote&gt;«I remember when Jorge began to talk about socialism one day while were walking in San Miguel. (...)He said it would be the most fair, no one would starve to death and that life would be better for everyone when that system was implanted, and that it was certain that it would be implemented(...)But in fact it was not so common to talk about politics within the band, because music was what filled us. We had no political prisoners in our families, and we did not go to protests. Although nevertheless, we began to detest Pinochet by observing the things that happened in those days, like the "Caso Degollados"[[Caso Degollados|(Case of the Slit Throats)]], for example. Jorge Gonzalez has said many times that the lyrics were only a "Stuffing" in the songs of "Los Prisioneros". But It was he who invented those songs. (...)Our band will be remembered forever by those who lived through the dictatorship —Precisely  because of that— because there was a dictatorship and people could basically do nothing except sing the songs of our band. I have no idea if the fame and popularity of the band would have been the same without the Milicos (military regime) but I have the feeling that no, it wouldn't have. I believe we belong to that period whether we like it or not».{{sfn|Narea|2009|pages=111 and 112}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1980s, Jorge González - leader and principal songwriter of the band - said: "...Los Prisioneros (The Prisoners) does not belong to any political party and we were not based on an ideological base nor an anti-establishment base...it is that —after the songs are made— those things appear in the foreground... We only say  what common people feel. Some people recriminate against a capitalist society —not because they had read Marx— but because the money they have is not enough to buy everything that the television teaches one needs to be happy... To say that we are anti-establishment sounds like propaganda. We don't recriminate against one person but against the whole system as such..." According to Carlos Fonseca: The vision they had for the trio of San Miguel is that they wanted to be a successful group,  "...That is why we did not dedicate lyrics to Chile... Now, over time, we realize that despite that, the people turned those songs into tools of their struggle against the dictatorship. That is why Jorge gets upset when asked about this, because he never felt he was doing protest songs".

==Musical style, influences==
"Los Prisioneros" described their music as [[New wave music|new wave]]. When they were in high school they listened to [[The Beatles]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and the [[Bee Gees]]. However it was the British [[punk rock]] band [[The Clash]] who influenced them the most, particularly in their beginning phase. According to Narea: "...In 1981 we heard The Clash for the first time, through a 90-minute cassette that Claudio and Rodrigo Beltran just happened to record from a special radio concert. It featured the band's latest album at the time, titled ''[[Sandinista!]]''. We were surprised by the diversity of sounds and beats from rock, to reggae, from jazz to even a bit of waltz added with humor, it was something so completely new for us..." Even Jorge Gonzalez declared "Sandinista!" his favorite album. The influence of [[The Clash]] was evident in Los Prisioneros albums such as La Voz De Los '80s (The Voice of the 80s) and also in their album "La Cultura De La basura" (trashy culture). They also influenced the lyrics and the look of the video clip "We are Sudamerican rockers." The wonder and appreciation they felt for the British band also led them to listen to other artists who cultivated the same genres, such as: The Specials, The Stranglers, [[Bob Marley]], The Cars, Adam and the Ants, and Devo among others. Some critics have stated that Los Prisioneros were influenced by The Police but the group has emphatically denied this. According to the Chilean pop group "Bambú," «No necesitamos banderas» was the first reggae album ever recorded in Chile.

In 1985, Jorge and Miguel were being influenced by the techno sound from groups such as Depeche Mode, Ultravox and Heaven 17. They were also influenced by new wave groups such as The Cure, as well as indie rock Groups like The Smiths and Aztec Camera.  Jorge Gonzalez stated that Los Prisioneros were more a techno pop group than a rock group. Ibeas Lalo, lead singer of the group Chancho en Piedra said, "...it was too risky and brave for Los Prisioneros to have made their second album while radically changing the sound of the band. To shift from the sound of the guitars to the style of The Clash and from there to the synthesizers sound, and yet still being able to sound like themselves..."

The band is classified as rock, [[Rock en Español]], pop, [[folk music|folk]], punk, [[post-punk]], new wave, [[techno]], [[electronic music]], synthpop and [[rockabilly]]. Also, influences of [[rock and roll]], hardcore, reggae, [[jazz]], [[ska]], [[rap]], [[dance music|dance]], [[vals (Peruvian)|vals]] and [[experimental music]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

}}
The '''Lotus chalice''' or '''Alabaster chalice''', called the '''Wishing Cup''' by [[Howard Carter]], derives from the [[Tomb of Tutankhamun|tomb]] of the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]] ([[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]], [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]). The object received the find number 014 and is now on display in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]], with the inventory number JE 67465.

== Discovery ==
The tomb of the young king in the [[List_of_burials_in_the_Valley_of_the_Kings#East_Valley|East Valley of the Kings]] ([[KV62]]) was uncovered almost untouched in the [[Valley of the Kings]] in West [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] by [[Howard Carter]] on 4 November 1922. The lotus chalice was one of the first objects which Carter and his excavators found on entering the tomb. The vessel was almost directly behind the entrance of the corridor to the antechamber, where they broke in, on the ground. This was not its original position.&lt;ref&gt;Jaromir Malek. ''The Treasures of Tutankhamun.'' London 2006, {{ISBN|0-233-00197-2}}, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Material and significance ==
[[File:Heh.svg|thumb|upright|[[Heh (god)|Heh]] kneeling on the Neb symbol with the symbols of infinity: Shen ring, tadpoles and palm rib]]
The lotus chalice is made from a single piece of [[alabaster]]. The chalice has the shape of a [[Nymphaea|lotus]] in full bloom. The handles on both sides are identical, shaped like lotus flowers growing upward, with the [[ancient Egyptian deities|god]] [[Heh (god)|Heh]] seated on a basket (the neb symbol) on the tips of the leaves. In each hand Heh holds a palm rib with notches for counting the years and a tadpole sitting on a [[shen ring]] below each one. This is a typical depiction of the god of the "million years", the god of infinity and eternity: the palm rib is the [[Hieroglyph]] for year, while both the shen ring and the tadpole were symbols of eternity. A kneeling image of the god was the hieroglyph for the number "one million". The same motif is found on other items from the tomb. For example, wooden stool (JE 62029, find number 87). At the upper end of each palm rib there is an [[ankh]] symbol, the sign of life. The chalice therefore symbolises the infinite and eternal life of King Tutankhamun.

The lotus is significant in [[Egyptian mythology]] for the birth of the sun god, who emerged from the lotus, after it had risen out of the flood of the primeval waters of [[Nun]]. The name of the king in the centre of the white open flower therefore symbolised his rebirth.

== Inscriptions ==
[[File:Tutankhamen tomb layout.jpg|thumb|upright|Floorplan of KV62]]
The inscriptions are engraved and filled with dark paste. Howard Carter copied the inscriptions and asked [[Alan Gardiner]] to provide a translation, since he required this for publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/perl/gi-ca-qmakedeta.pl?sid=95.89.186.47-1387916681&amp;qno=1&amp;dfnam=014-c014-2 ''Card/Transcription No.: 014-2'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The main lotus, which forms the actual chalice, had the king's [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|throne name]] (''Neb-kheperw-Re'' - Lord in Forms, Re) and personal name (''Twt-ankh-amun'' - Living image of [[Amun]]), "may he live forever." The first column names him as "beloved of [[Amun-Re]], Lord of the throne of the two Lands (''Neb-neswt tawi''), Lord of Heaven (''Neb-pet'').&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Theodor Zauzich: ''Hieroglyphen ohne Geheimnis.'' (= ''[[Kulturgeschichte der antiken Welt]].''). von Zabern, Darmstadt/ Mainz 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-8053-4267-4}}. S. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; The writing runs from right to left.

The inscription on the rim of the chalice is to be read in two directions. From right to left, beginning with the [[Horus]] falcon, are the more rarely attested Horus name and Nebty name of Tutankhamun. From left to right, beginning with the [[ankh]] symbol, is the following:
: ''May your ''[[Ka (Egyptian soul)|ka]]'' live, may you spend millions of years, you, who love Thebes, sitting with your face to the north wind, your eyes beholding happiness.''&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Reeves, John H. Taylor: ''Howard Carter before Tutankhamun.'' British Museum Press; London 1992, {{ISBN|0-714-10959-2}}, p. 188; T. G. H. James: ''Tutanchamun. Der ewige Glanz des jungen Pharaos.'' Köln 2000, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;


Because of the inscription, Howard Carter called the lotus chalice the ''King's Wishing Cup''. The wish inscription from the lotus chalice is quoted on the second gravestone of Howard Carter.

== Display ==
In addition to being displayed in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo, the lotus chalice was among the original finds selected for the first temporary exhibition of the [[grave goods]] of Tutankhamun. It was also on display with the exhibition number 39 in the world-touring ''[[Exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun#The Treasures of Tutankhamun (1972–1981)|Treasures of Tutankhamun]]'' exhibition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8214">The '''Maldives Pavilion''' represents the Republic of the [[Maldives]] at the International Art Exhibition - la [[Venice Biennale#Maldives|Biennale di Venezia]] among the National Pavilions. The inaugural Pavilion was introduced in 2013&lt;ref&gt;''55. Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte – la Biennale di Venezia. Il palazzo enciclopedico'', Marsilio Editori, {{ISBN|978-88-317-1558-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the 55th Venice Biennale, curated by [[Massimiliano Gioni]]. The Commissioner of the Pavilion is The Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture of Republic of the Maldives. The inaugural pavilion explored the themes of ecological romanticism and climate crisis.

==Maldives Pavilion 2013==
Portable Nation:  Disappearance as Work in Progress – Approaches to Ecological Romanticism,&lt;ref&gt;http://maldivespavilion.com/blog/press-release-2/&lt;/ref&gt; The first presentation of the National Pavilion of the Maldives, was presented from June 1 through to November 24 of 2013.

Presented as an international exhibition devoted to the topic of climate change and eco-aesthetics, the Pavilion combined the dual focuses of the beauty of the nation's landscapes with the rich visual history of this Republic. The exhibition provided an "aesthetical experience and extensive knowledge of the concept of Contemporary Environmental Romanticism&lt;ref&gt;http://maldivespavilion.com/blog/curatorial-statement/&lt;/ref&gt; through the works of the Official Artists and the Collateral Events.

The Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture, and the Republic of the Maldives serve as the Commissioner of the Pavilion and appointed the Curators of this exhibition, the international collective CPS – Chamber of Public Secrets (Alfredo Cramerotti, Aida Eltorie, Khaled Ramadan). As part of the curatorial background, CPS notes that "A 60 cm raise in sea levels would see the entirety of the Maldives smothered by the ocean and make the Maldivian population probably the first refugees of global warming."&lt;ref&gt;http://maldivespavilion.com/blog/background/&lt;/ref&gt; Considered as being one of the most endangered Countries by the [[current sea level rise]] associated with climatological effects of human influences, nature as a culturally defined etymology is used as a point of departure for explorations of the ethics of climate change contingencies such as the possibility of [[Environmental migrant|climate refugees]]

The subtitle of the Pavilion, [http://www.maldivespavilion.com ''Disappearance as work in progress – approaches to Ecological Romanticism], conceived the Maldives Pavilion as a platform for artists, environmental campaigners, and thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Deimling, "Island Nations Seize the Venice Biennale Spotlight to Decry Climate Change," ''Blouin Artinfo'', April 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Schafler, ''Hacking the Future and Planet…'', Folio Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-85256-611-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue of the Pavilion was the Gervasuti Foundation on via Garibaldi, a former Wood-shop since converted into a foundation.&lt;ref&gt;''Portable Nation. Maldives Pavilion'', edited by Dorian Batycka, Camilla Boemio, Alfredo Cramerotti, Aida Eltoire, Maretti Editore, {{ISBN|978-88-89477-519}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time of the Exhibition, the foundation operated as an exhibition space, a bookstore, as well as a terrace cafe with weekly curated events presented by Curator-in-Residence Mike Watson of Joan of Art: Towards a Free Education, through the Collateral Events programming.&lt;ref&gt;http://maldivespavilion.com/blog/call-for-participants-joan-of-art/&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the preview program of the Biennale, the Pavilion realized an ephemeral outdoor installation: ''The Ice Monolith''. Participating artist [[Stefano Cagol]] placed a block of ice from the Italian Alps on the shore of Venice in Riva Cà di Dio and symbolically left it melting, shooting the entire 60 hours process.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Cagol, The Ice Monolith. Platform,  {{ISBN|978-88-902879-6-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Jolles "Editorial" + Cover, ''Kunstbulletin'', July–August&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition catalogue was published in 2014 by Maretti Editore and is entitled: ''Portable Nation. Maldives Pavilion'', edited by Dorian Batycka, Camilla Boemio, Alfredo Cramerotti, Aida Eltoire, Maretti Editore, 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-89477-519}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3108">'''Manasology''' (кyrgyz. ''Манастаануу'') is a separate line of research within Kyrgyz studies, which looks into the scientific study of the Kyrgyz [[Manas epic]]. Representatives of this [[scientific]] area are called ''manasologists''.

==Periods of development==
Scientific research of the epic began in the second half of the XIX century by Ch. [[Valikhanov]] and V. [[Radlov]]. Valikhanov had recorded one of the episodes ("Pominki po Kyokyotoyu") in 1856 and partially translated it into Russian. The texts published by Radlov in 1885 in St. Petersburg (in Kyrgyz and German languages) occupy 12,454 lines (including 9449 lines about "Manas")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karalaev|first1=Sayakbai|title=Manas|date=1984|location=Frunze|url=https://bilim.akipress.org/lib/book:333/manas-po-variantu-sayakbaya-karalaeva-kniga-1-frunze-1984g/?from=bilim&amp;place=type|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Full record of the texts of the "Manas" [[trilogy]] has been carried out since 1920, however, fixing versions by [[manaschi]], let alone their full publication are still far from complete.

Kazakh writer M.O. Auezov wrote the first work after Chokan Valikhanov’s works, a monograph on the Kyrgyz "[[Epic of Manas|Manas]]" epic, by creating of a free version of his texts. Monuments were erected for both Kazakh researchers in the [[Bishkek]] city. Among the [[Russian scientists]] who studied the epic, V. Radlov should be noted (the author of the first Russian translation of fragments of the epic), P. Falev (the author of the first [[Soviet]] study on "Manas" - articles "How the Kara-Kygyz epic is built") and S. [[Malov]].

The All-Union Scientific Conference of 1952 in [[Bishkek|Frunze]] came to the conclusion that the epic "is folk in its basis"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karalayev|first1=Sayakbai|title=Manas II|date=1984|location=Frunze|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Among the translators of the epic into Russian are S. [[Lipkin]], L. [[Penkovsky]], M. Tarlovskiy and others. The largest Russian translation (prosaic) is in 4 volumes  so far by A.S. Mirbadaleva and N. V. Kydaish-Pokrovskaya for a bilingual edition in the series "Epic of the Peoples of the USSR" (1984-1995), covers about 50 thousand lines (according to S.Orozbakov).

The first one who played the "Manas" epic in [[Russian language]] in the translations of E. [[Polivanov]], L. [[Penkovsky]], M. Tarlevsky and S. [[Lipkin]], is a national artist of Kyrgyzstan Valery Rovinsky.

Abbreviated versions of the epic exist in [[Kazakh language]] (4 volumes in M. Auezov's presentation, including 2 parts about Manas and the part about Semetey and Seytek) and in [[Uzbek language]] (the poet Mirtemir); separate episodes were translated into German, Hungarian, English and other languages.

==Scientific institutions==
The main center of manasology is the National Center for Manasology and Art Culture of the National Academy of Sciences of the [[Kyrgyz Republic]] (director - Akmataliev, Abdyldazhan Amanturovich).

'''The Notre-Dame Affair''' was an action performed by [[Michel Mourre]], [[Serge Berna]], Ghislain Desnoyers de Marbaix, and Jean Rullier, members of the radical wing of the [[Lettrist]] movement, on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1950, at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in Paris, while the mass was aired live on national TV. Mourre, dressed in the habit of a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[monk]] and backed by his co-conspirators, chose a quiet moment in the Easter High Mass to climb to the rostrum and declaim before the whole congregation a blasphemous anti-sermon on the death of God, penned by Berna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snarkout.org/archives/2002/11/24/ Snarkout: to have done with the judgment of god!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031113002215/http://www.snarkout.org/archives/2002/11/24/ |date=2003-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
    Aujourd’hui, jour de Pâques en l’Année sainte, 
    Ici, dans l’insigne Basilique de Notre-Dame de Paris,
    J’accuse l’Église Catholique Universelle du détournement mortel de nos forces vives en faveur d’un ciel vide ;
    J’accuse l’Église Catholique d’escroquerie ;
    J’accuse l’Église Catholique d’infecter le monde de sa morale mortuaire,
    d’être le chancre de l’Occident décomposé.
    En vérité je vous le dis : Dieu est mort.
    Nous vomissons la fadeur agonisante de vos prières,
    car vos prières ont grassement fumé les champs de bataille de notre Europe.
    Allez dans le désert tragique et exaltant d’une terre où Dieu est mort
    et brassez à nouveau cette terre de vos mains nues,
    de vos mains d’orgueil,
    de vos mains sans prière.
    Aujourd’hui, jour de Pâques en l’Année sainte,
    Ici, dans l’insigne Basilique de Notre-Dame de France,
    nous clamons la mort du Christ-Dieu pour qu’enfin vive l’Homme.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
    Today, Easter day of the Holy Year,
    Here, under the emblem of Notre-Dame of Paris,
    I accuse the universal Catholic Church of the lethal diversion of our living strength toward an empty heaven,
    I accuse the Catholic Church of swindling,
    I accuse the Catholic Church of infecting the world with its funereal morality,
    Of being the running sore on the decomposed body of the West.
    Verily I say unto you: God is dead,
    We vomit the agonizing insipidity of your prayers,
    For your prayers have been the greasy smoke over the battlefields of our Europe.
    Go forth then into the tragic and exalting desert of a world where God is dead,
    And till this earth anew with your bare hands,
    With your PROUD hands,
    With your unpraying hands.
    Today Easter day of the Holy Year,
    Here under the emblem of Notre-Dame of Paris,
    We proclaim the death of the Christ-god, so that Man may live at last.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The aftermath==
The action and the events leading up to and following it are described in detail in Michel Mourre's autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Mourre, ''In Spite of Blasphemy'', John Lehmann, 1953; translated from the French by A.W. Fielding&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the action, young [[Bohemianism|bohemians]] tied to [[Lettrism]], an avant-garde movement surrounding [[Isidore Isou]], were all arrested by the police, and thereby saved, in effect, from the furious mob that chased them from the church.&lt;ref name="Marcus89p279-86"&gt;[[Greil Marcus]] (1989) ''[[Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the 20th Century]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=TVAoeipLL38C preview] at Google books, pp.279-86&lt;/ref&gt; The only one held for any length of time was Mourre, himself a former Dominican monk and the instigator of the whole affair. As his fate was being decided, dozens of prominent voices from culture, the church and the state joined a debate in the newspapers on the merits or (more commonly) not, of the provocation. 

In particular ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', an organ of the [[French Resistance]], began with a commentary by its editor Louis Pauwels condemning the action; but a vehement letter in response by [[André Breton]], attacking Pauwels for his "partial account," and defending the actions, escalated the debate;&lt;ref name="Boucharenc05"&gt;Boucharenc, Myriam (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=uYKf2PLK1BgC ''L'universel reportage''], pp.94-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Breton50NotreDame"&gt;[[André Breton|Breton, André]] (1950) [http://juralibertaire.over-blog.com/article-le-scandale-de-notre-dame-41681161.html ''Lettre a Louis Pauwels" sur le «"scandale" de Notre Dame»''], in ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', April 12, 1950, ''OC III'', pp.1024-5&lt;/ref&gt; to it were devoted eight days of coverage and a running editorial forum amounting to a total of twenty-some articles by such figures as [[Jean Paulhan]], Pierre Emmanuel, [[Maurice Nadeau]], Messieur the Police Commissioner, le curé de Saint-Pierre de Chaillot, [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Benjamin Péret]], and [[René Char]].

The police and the Church, for their part, unable to let the insult pass unpunished, nevertheless wanted to avoid amplifying it through a public trial. After a few days they brought in a psychiatrist of questionable integrity, who recommended locking Mourre away in an asylum. Participants in the Combat debate, attentive to the case, protested, and upon the intervention of a second psychiatrist, Mourre was released on 21 April.

The scandal resonated into the heart of the Lettrist movement. Consistent with practices of agitation on which Isou had founded his movement in 1945, the Notre-Dame affair nevertheless put Isou's radicality, and that of his supporters, to the test. The action thus advanced a nascent rupture in the movement, between two blocs which could be called, respectively, "artistic" and "actionist," a rupture which two years later would lead to a schism and formation of the [[Lettrist International]]. It was after [[Gil J. Wolman]], Jean-Louis Brau, and [[Guy Debord]], the principal agents of this schism, joined the Lettrist movement, siding with the actionist Ultra-Lettrist bloc still distinguished by the Notre-Dame Affair, and who, along with [[Ivan Chtcheglov]] and Berna, formed the LI. It was the LI, launched on the occasion of an intervention directed against [[Charlie Chaplin]], that between 1952 and 1957 experimented with new forms of art and action that would lead to the [[Situationist International]].

The contributors to the Combat debate sought to diminish the importance of the Notre-Dame action by pointing out that it was not entirely without precedent, as, on 22 March 1892, young [[Blanquistes]] had interrupted mass, shouting "Long live the Republic! Long live the Commune! Down with the Church!"

'''Omphalion''' in Greek means "navel (of the earth)"; compare the ''[[omphalos]]'' of [[Delphi]].

==Hagia Sophia==
[[File:Omphalion ste-sophie istanbul 15 oct 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Omphalion at the [[Hagia Sophia]] (2011)]]
One of the most intriguing features of [[Hagia Sophia|St. Sophia]] is a marble section of the floor known as the Omphalos. The Omphalos is located in the south-east quarter of the main square beneath the dome, exactly in the middle of the square. Each side measures 5.65 meters (18.5 feet). Within the square lay 30 circles of various sizes. There is one large circle in the middle; 4 circles of equal size at each corner; 2 smaller circles of similar size occupy the space between each corner circle; 16 smaller circles in-between these. The 3 remaining circles are on the south end and are linked to the 4 larger circles on that end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedone|first1=Silvia|title=The Marble Omphalos of Saint Sophia in Constantinople|date=2011|page=751}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most striking feature of the Omphalos is the brilliant [[marble]], with a myriad of types and colors mixed in. Marble was the material of choice for Imperial churches. Strangely, it was believed to be created by earthy matter freezing in water that had sunk into the Earth's crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barry|first1=Fabio|title=Walking on Water: Cosmic Floors in Antiquity and the Middle Ages|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=Dec 2007|volume=89|issue=4|url=https://search.proquest.com/artshumanities/docview/222978706/B6040F5BF77A497BPQ/7|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is unusual and has been interpreted in many ways over the years. One interpretation could be that is that the central circle could be the sun, with the solar system orbiting around it. This would fit with the absolute rule of the Emperor. The asymmetry is particularly odd, given when compared to the omphalos at [[Hosios Loukas]] in Greece. This omphalos dates from the Middle Byzantine, some five hundred years after the St. Sophia's if it is indeed an original feature, and is completely symmetrical in design. Stylistically, the interiors of Hagia Sophia have been categorized as a "jeweled style".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schibille|first1=Nadine|title=Hagia Sophia and the Byzantine Aesthetic Experience|date=2014-11-28|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781472447951|page=98|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/psu/detail.action?docID=1808795|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials utilized were selected to retain and reflect light. The mosaics used [[Tessera|tesserae]] of varying colors, texturized and oriented to reflect the light pouring in from the massive dome. Color was very important as certain colors, and certain materials, conveyed messages of status and prestige. The effect of the sunlight shining through the windows surrounding the base of the dome hitting the tesserae would have been awe-inspiring. Comparatively, the Omphalos is more demure and understated.

Historically, it was thought to mark the spot where Byzantine emperors were crowned during the [[coronation]] ceremony. Evidence of this comes from [[Anthony of Novgorod|Antony of Novgorod]], who wrote a description of St. Sophia in the early 13th century. He wrote "there is a red marble stone with a golden throne placed on it. On this throne the emperors were crowned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedone|first1=Silvia|title=The Marble Omphalos of Saint Sophia in Constantinople|date=2011|page=753}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been challenged over the years because of the dearth of textual reference from writers and travelers in the Byzantine Era. Hagia Sophia herself has been altered so many times since the sixth-century that the Omphalion disappears and re-appears sporadically in the textual evidence that does exist. We know that it was covered over with carpets by the Ottomans after they converted it into a mosque. The design is unique to Hagia Sophia, with little in the way of direct comparisons. There are two examples from the 11th and 12th centuries, [[Hosios Loukas|Hosios Lukas]] and [[Nea Moni of Chios|Nea Moni]]. The comparison is difficult considering the 500 year difference. All of the marble used in the floors of St. Sophia was quarried around the time of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schibille|first1=Nadine|title=Hagia Sophia and the Byzantine Aesthetic Experience|date=2014-11-28|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781472447951|page=99|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/psu/detail.action?docID=1808795|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Byzantine architecture of the time favored the incorporation of [[spolia]] to celebrate the triumph of Christianity over Paganism, as much of the spolia was sourced from Greek and Roman temples throughout the Empire. Dating of the Omphalos has varied, with some dating it to the reign of Justinian, and some dating it as a later addition, particularly to the reign of Basil I (867-886). The evidence used to argue for this later dating is the seemingly odd placement within Hagia Sophia. However, it is placed in the center of one of the four squares beneath the dome, indicating the placement was not as random as it seems at first glance. Historian Nadine Schibille argues that it fits seamlessly into the original flooring, therefore she concludes that it was an original feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nadine|first1=Schibille|title=Hagia Sophia and the Byzantine Aesthetic Experience|date=2014-11-28|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781472447951|page=100|url=https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.lib.pdx.edu/lib/psu/detail.action?docID=1808795|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Silvia Pedone does not attempt to assign a specific date to it, but she theorizes that it was arranged differently than what is seen today. Some of the smaller circles might have been an addition during re-decoration in the 9th century. The church suffered damage during an earthquake in 1346 that could have damaged the marble. This could account for the asymmetrical design, with repairs altering the overall design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedone|first1=Silvia|title=The Marble Omphalos of Saint Sophia in Constantinople|date=2011|page=763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Omphalia==
The word ''omphalion'' is also used to describe other sacred circular marking slabs that were usually located in important or especially sacred churches throughout the Byzantine Empire.

The marble omphalion from the floor of the Church of Hagia Sophia in [[Trabzon]] (north coast of modern Turkey) was brought to [[Thessalonica]] by Greek refugees in 1924.

Encyclopedia.com.&lt;/ref&gt; OBAC aimed to coordinate artistic support in the struggle for freedom, justice and equality of opportunity for African Americans. The organization had workshops for visual arts, theater, and writing, and produced two publications: a newsletter, ''Cumbaya'', and the magazine ''Nommo''.&lt;ref name=encyclo /&gt;

==Background==
Among those associated at various times with the OBAC Writers Workshop are founding member [[Haki Madhubuti|Don L. Lee]] (now Haki Madhubuti), [[Carolyn Rodgers]], [[Angela Jackson]], [[Sterling Plumpp]], [[Sam Greenlee]], [[Nikki Giovanni]], [[Sonia Sanchez]], [[Johari Amini]], D. L. Crockett-Smith, [[Cecil Brown (writer)|Cecil Brown]], [[Sandra Jackson-Opoku]], and other writers of national stature.&lt;ref name=encyclo /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackartsinteractive.com/featured-organization Black Arts Interactive.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theater Workshop eventually led to the first black theater in Chicago, Kuumba Theater.

Members of the OBAC Visual Workshop produced a mural dedicated to African-American heroes such as [[Muhammad Ali]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], and [[Malcolm X]], known as the [[Wall of Respect]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG01/hughes/mural.html Timeline], Perceptions of Black.&lt;/ref&gt; The artists involved included [[William Walker (muralist)|William Walker]], [[Wadsworth Jarrell]] and [[Jeff Donaldson (artist)|Jeff Donaldson]], who has written of the collective's determination to produce a "collaborative work as a contribution to the community".&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Donaldson, [https://coral.uchicago.edu:8443/display/chicago68/The+Rise,+Fall+and+Legacy+of+the+Wall+of+Respect+Movement "The Rise, Fall and Legacy of the Wall of Respect Movement"], in ''International Review of African American Art'', vol. 15, no. 1 (1991), pp. 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Donaldson went on to found the Coalition of Black Revolutionary Artists (COBRA), later renamed the [[African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists]] (AfriCOBRA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://africobra.com/ AfriCOBRA website.]&lt;/ref&gt; in support of [[Pan-Africanism]].

After the visual arts and the drama workshops closed, OBAC became solely a writers' workshop within a couple of years, and continued in that form until 1992, surviving longer than any other literary group of the [[Black Arts Movement]] that flourished in the 1960s and '70s.&lt;ref name=encyclo /&gt; As S. Brandi Barnes, former treasurer and subsequently director of OBAC-Writers Workshop, wrote in 2010:&lt;blockquote&gt; "By the mid 1990s, the writers workshop closed its doors — for a while.

Former OBAC member and adjunct professor Collette Armstead returned to Chicago in 2004. She convinced Angela Jackson of the need to revive the workshop....

We have always been an organization built by committed volunteers, intellectuals, artists, writers, and community denizens—all of whom have held other day jobs. They blazed the trail, solidifying our place in the literary archives and canon of Chicago and America.

...OBAC-WW has been reconstructed to continue our advocacy for all writers, and in particular for African-American writers. Part of our future plans include involving younger generations, so that tradition and new creations will continue."&lt;ref&gt;S. Brandi Barnes, [http://www.chicagoartistsresource.org/artist-stories/s-brandi-barnes-obac-writers-workshop "The Torch Is Lit: The Organization of Black American Culture, Past and Present"], Chicago Artists Resource, Spring 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Oriental Stories,''''' later retitled '''''The Magic Carpet Magazine''''', was an American [[pulp magazine]] of 1930-34, an offshoot of the famous ''[[Weird Tales]]''.

Like its parent, it was published by [[J.C. Henneberger]]'s Popular Fiction Publishing and edited by [[Farnsworth Wright]]. As its titles indicate, the magazine specialized in adventure and fantasy stories with Oriental settings and elements. Its stories were largely written by the same distinctive group of authors that filled the pages of ''Weird Tales,'' including [[Robert E. Howard]],&lt;ref&gt;"Robert E. Howard, Professional Writer" by [[Glenn Lord]], in Don Herron, ed. 
''The Dark Barbarian: The Writings of Robert E Howard, a Critical Anthology.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1984, (pp. 135-148).

[[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]], in Ashley and M.B. Tymn.  ''Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Weird Fiction Magazines''. Westport: Greenwood, 1985. (pp. 454-456). {{ISBN|0-313-21221-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine struggled financially for the entirety of its existence (as indeed did ''Weird Tales''); it was published first bi-monthly, then quarterly, during the grimmest years of the [[Great Depression]]. Volume 1 of ''Oriental Stories'' consisted of 6 issues that appeared on newsstands from October 1930 through Autumn 1931; Volume 2 comprised only 3 issues in the first half of 1932 (Winter, Spring, Summer). After a six-month hiatus, the first of four quarterly issues of Volume 3 appeared in January 1933, but with the new title ''The Magic Carpet.'' ("Oriental Stories combined with The Magic Carpet Magazine," read the masthead of Vol. 3 No. 1, January 1933.)
One notable contributor to ''The Magic Carpet'' was popular pulp author [[H. Bedford-Jones]].&lt;ref name="os" /&gt; Still unable to muster sufficient circulation, Volume 4 started and ended with the single issue No. 1 in January 1934. ''The Magic Carpet'' was then defunct.

'''Sir Oswald Walters Brierly''' (19 May 1817 - 14 December 1894), [[England|English]] [[ocean|marine]] [[Painting|painter]], who came of an old [[Cheshire]] family, was born at [[Chester]].

==Life==
He was the son of Thomas Brierly, a doctor and amateur artist, who belonged to an old [[Cheshire]] family, was born at [[Chester]] on 19 May 1817. After a general grounding in art at the academy of [[Henry Sass]] in [[Bloomsbury]], he went to [[Plymouth]] to study naval architecture and [[rigging]]. He exhibited drawings of two [[Man-of-war|men-of-war]] at Plymouth, {{HMS|Pique||2}} and {{HMS|Gorgon||2}}, at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1839. He then spent some time in the study of navigation, and in 1841 started on a voyage to Australia with his friend [[Benjamin Boyd]] in the latter's [[yacht]] ''Wanderer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/brierly-sir-oswald-walters-3054 |title=Brierly, Sir Oswald Walters (1817–1894) |last=Bassett |first=Marnie |last2=Smith |first2=Bernard |lastauthoramp=y |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rattlesnake2.jpg|thumb|upright|HMS ''Rattlesnake'' off Sydney Heads by Oswald Brierly c. 1849]]
Boyd established himself in [[New South Wales]] as a merchant banker, pastoralist, shipowner, [[Whaling|whaler]] and member of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/boyd-benjamin-ben-1815 |title=Boyd, Benjamin (Ben) (1801–1851) |last=Walsh |first=G. P. |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brierly lived in southern New South Wales in a new settlement named [[Boydtown]] where he managed Boyd's whaling operations until 1848. Boyd even went so far as to have a house named "Merton Cottage" built for him.&lt;ref name="whaling-experience"&gt;{{cite book |title=Coast: A history of the New South Wales Edge |first=Ian |last=Hoskins |year=2013 |publisher=NewSouth |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brierly Point, on the coast of New South Wales commemorates his connection with that colony. His familiarity with the whaling industry led to a number of paintings of whaling subjects.

In 1848, Captain [[Owen Stanley]], elder brother of [[Arthur Penrhyn Stanley]], then in command of {{HMS|Rattlesnake|1822|6}}, invited Brierly to be his guest during an [[Admiralty]] survey of the north and east coast of Australia and the adjacent islands, in which [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] took part as biological observer. Brierly accompanied the survey during two cruises and took not only sketches, but notes of considerable value, which, however, remained unpublished. His name was given to an island in the [[Louisiade archipelago]].

In March 1850, the Hon. [[Henry Keppel]] asked Brierly to join him on {{HMS|Maeander|1840|6}}. He then visited New Zealand, the [[Friendly Islands|Friendly]] and [[Society Islands]], and crossed the Pacific to [[Valparaiso]]. The cruise extended to the coasts of Chile, Peru, and Mexico, and the ship returned by the [[Straits of Magellan]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]], and reached England at the end of July 1851.{{sfn|Dodgson|1901}}

[[File:KEPPEL (1853) pg145 VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN, COMBA ISLAND.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Maeander|1840|6}}, painted  c. 1851.]]
Keppel's account of the voyage, published in 1853, was illustrated by eight [[lithograph]]s by Brierly, who was made a fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] on his return. After the [[Crimean War|declaration of war]] with the [[Russian Empire]] in February 1854, Brierly was again Keppel's guest, on {{HMS|St Jean d'Acre|1853|6}}, and the painter was present at all the operations of the allied fleets in the [[Baltic Sea]], and sent home sketches for publication in the ''Illustrated London News.''
On the return of the fleet, Brierly had a series of fifteen large lithographs executed from his drawings, which were published on 2 April 1855, with the title ''The English and French Fleets in the Baltic, 1854.'' In the second year of the war, he accompanied Keppel to the Black Sea; witnessed all the chief events of the war in the [[Black Sea]] and [[Sea of Azov]], and visited [[Circassia]] and [[Mingrelia]] with the [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]] on {{HMS|Highflyer|1851|6}}. After his return, he was commanded by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] to take sketches from the [[royal yacht]] of the great [[naval review]] which was held at [[Spithead]] at the end of the war.{{sfn|Dodgson|1901}}

[[File:HMS Rattlesnake (1822).jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Rattlesnake|1822|6}}, painted  1853.]]
This was the commencement of a third period in the artist's career, during which he received the constant patronage of the royal family. In 1863, he accompanied [[Prince Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg|Count Gleichen]] in {{HMS|Racoon|1857|6}}, on which the future [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke of Edinburgh]] was [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]], to Norway, and when the duke was appointed to the command of {{HMS|Galatea|1859|6}}, Brierly was attached to his suite and accompanied him on a cruise in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and afterwards round the world, which lasted from 26 February 1867 to 26 June 1868. The sketches made by Brierly during the voyage were exhibited at South Kensington in 1868, and he contributed the illustrations to the record of the voyage by the Rev. John Milner, published in 1869.
In 1868, Brierly was attached to the suite of the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] during the tour to the Nile, [[Constantinople]], and the [[Crimea]]. He contributed five drawings to the Royal Academy exhibitions of 1859–61; he exhibited again in 1870–71, but ceased to exhibit at the Academy on becoming an associate of the Royal Water-colour Society in 1872.

[[File:South Sea whalers boiling blubber.jpg|thumb|left|South Sea whalers boiling blubber, c1876. Dixon Galleries, [[State Library of New South Wales]].]]
During the remainder of his life he contributed about two hundred water-colours to the society's exhibitions. These were, in part, founded on his early working life and travel experiences. His visits to [[Venice]] in 1874 and 1882 also supplied him materials for many of his most elaborate pictures; but the most characteristic subjects of his later period were historical. The first of these was 'The Retreat of the Spanish Armada' (Royal Academy, 1871). This was followed by 'Drake taking the Capitana to Torbay' (Royal Water-colour Society, 1872), and many other subjects from the history of the [[Spanish Armada]] and other stirring incidents of the [[Elizabethan age]].

One of the most successful of these was 'The Loss of the Revenge' (1877), which was engraved for the Art Union of London. 'The Sailing of the Armada' (1879) and 'The Decisive Battle off Gravelines' (1881) were etched by Mr. David Law in 1882. Brierly was appointed marine painter to Queen Victoria, on the death of [[John Christian Schetky]] in 1874. He became marine painter to the Royal Yacht Squadron at the same time. In 1880, he was elected a full member of the Royal Water-colour Society. In 1881, he was appointed curator of the [[Painted Hall]] at [[Greenwich]], and he received the honour of [[knighthood]] in 1885. He died in London on 14 December 1894.{{sfn|Dodgson|1901}}

==Family==
In 1851, Brierly married, first, Sarah, daughter of Edmund Fry, a member of the Society of Friends. She died in 1870. In 1872 he married Louise Marie, eldest daughter of the painter, Louis Huard of London and Brussels. His second wife survived him.{{sfn|Dodgson|1901}}

'''Peintre de la Marine''' (''Painter of the Fleet'') is a title awarded by the [[minister of Defence (France)|Minister of defence]] in [[France]] to artists who have devoted their talents to the sea, the [[French Navy]] and other maritime subjects. It was set up in 1830 by the [[July Monarchy]] and can be awarded to painters photographers, illustrators, engravers, and sculptors.

== Rights and privileges ==
[[Image:Signature Jean Rigaud.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Signature of [[Jean Rigaud]] as Peintre de la Marine]]
The title is unpaid but does grant certain facilities and privileges:
*being able to embark on French Navy vessels
*wearing a uniform
*being allowed to follow one's artistic signature with an anchor
*belonging to the [[Service historique de la défense|Service historique de la Marine]].

The '''peintres agréés''' are named for a 3-year term by a jury of naval officiers and '''peintres titulaires''' and presided over by a general officer of the Navy. To become a peintre titulaire, one has to serve as a peintre agréé for more than 4 consecutive years.

== History ==
&lt;!---
La [[Monarchie de Juillet]] inaugure l'inscription des Peintres de la Marine à l'Annuaire en [[1830]] avec Crépin (1722-1851) et [[Théodore Gudin|Gudin]] (1802-1880). Cette tradition se maintiendra jusqu'en [[1962]]. 

Un annuaire de la Marine consacra en [[1830]] Gudin et Crépin premiers peintres du département de la Marine à porter un titre officiel permanent, le corps s'enrichit en [[1849]] de [[Lepoidevin]], en [[1854]] de [[Léon Morel-Fatio]]. Si beaucoup d'artistes familiers des Salons restèrent en dehors de la liste officielle comme Isabey, Charles Mozin, Gilbert ou Courdouan, et après presque un demi siècle pendant lequel trois peintres seulement furent nommés, le corps des peintres de la Marine se gonfla de onze noms dans la décennie 1880, puis de cinq en [[1890]], et de cinq autres l'année suivante. Dans les années 1930, Delpy, [[Marin-Marie]], [[Roger Chapelet|Chapelet]] et [[Albert Brenet|Brenet]] animèrent des promotions brillantes qui firent le renom de la nouvelle école française de peinture maritime.

Le corps des Peintres de la Marine perdure depuis près de deux siècles.
Ils ont aussi le sentiment de prolonger la grande école de peinture des bords de mer et des ciels marins que fut l'impressionnisme, et ils s’honorent d'avoir compté dans leurs rangs Marquet, Ziem, Signac et Gillot. En [[1860]], il existe quatre peintres au Département de la Marine dont Morel-Fatio ; en [[1900]], ils sont trente-deux. En 1914, ils sont cinquante-et-un.

Il faudra attendre [[1920]] pour qu'un décret donne statut aux Peintres de la Marine : le titre de "Peintre du Département de la Marine" est accordé par le Ministre pour une période de cinq ans renouvelable à des artistes ayant consacré leur talent à l'étude de la mer, de la Marine et de gens de mer. Ce titre ne donne droit à aucune rétribution mais seulement des facilités pour accomplir des missions dans les ports et sur les navires ainsi que la faculté d'ajouter une ancre à leur signature. En [[1924]], un nouveau décret vient modifier ce statut: le nombre des Peintres de la Marine est limité à vingt et le titre est conféré pour une période de trois ans. Un [[Salon de la Marine|salon biannuel]] est institué. Enfin, le décret de mars [[1953]] remanie le statut des Peintre de la Marine.
C'est un décret du 2 avril [[1981]], qui règle aujourd'hui la définition et l'attribution du titre de « peintre de la Marine ».

The '''Photographic Society of Madras''', also known as PSM, is a photographic society based in [[Chennai]] city of [[India]]. Founded in 1857, it is the oldest photographic society in India and one of the oldest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chen-events/countrys-oldest-photographic-society-takes-a-fresh-look/article5957300.ece |title=Countries oldest photographic society}}&lt;/ref&gt; PSM was founded in 1857, with the objective of promoting the Art and Science of [[Photography]]. The Society was renamed as Madras Amateur Photographic Society in the mid-1880s and later it reverted to its original name and continues to be known as Photographic Society of Madras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/city-explorer-for-the-shutterbugs/article6805260.ece |title=Photographic Society of Madras}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Photographic Society of Madras is registered under the [[Tamil Nadu]] Societies Registration Act 1975. PSM organizes programs including, photo-walks, photo-tours, classes, workshops, salons and exhibitions, on most weeks of the year. Membership is open to anyone with an interest in photography.

== History ==
Dr. Alexander Hunter, who founded The Photographic Society was also the driving force behind   [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai|Madras School of Industrial Arts]] where the Society used to have its initial meetings. [[Walter Elliot (Scottish naturalist)|Walter Elliot]], a member of the Governor's Council, was elected the first president of the society. Because of his proximity to the corridor of power, Walter Elliot inducted [[George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris|Lord Harris]], the Governor of the [[Madras Presidency]] as the four Southern States of India were known before Independence and then his successor, [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Trevelyn]] as members of the society. In the earlier years of its formation, its members were mostly Europeans - army men and civilians alike. The society met regularly in the premises of the School of Industrial Arts and held annual exhibitions. [[Linnaeus Tripe]], a pioneering photographer of British India, was one of the earliest members of this society.

== Exhibitions ==
The Society has held an annual exhibition since its beginning. The annual exhibition&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/leaving-a-lasting-impression/article1340687.ece&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the flagship events of the society which brings photographs from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/photography-upclose/article5944966.ece&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from annual exhibition it also conducts photography competitions and exhibitions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/Call-to-Shutterbugs-to-Capture-Madras-in-Frames/2014/08/05/article2364530.ece&lt;/ref&gt;  to commomerate specific days and celebrations to bring solidarity among the citizens of the city. The exhibition of member's work during the monthly member's meet is also a regular practise.

==Membership==
There are no restrictions on membership which includes amateur and professional photographers through to photographic scientists and those involved in exhibiting, curating and writing about photography, as well as those with a general interest in the medium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.photomadras.org/membership.php&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the great names in photographic history as well as many well-known photographers today have been members.

'''Rowland Frederick Hilder OBE''' (28 June 1905 &amp;ndash; 21 April 1993) was an English [[marine art|marine]] and [[landscape art|landscape]] [[artist]] and book [[illustrator]]. He was born in [[New York City|New York]] to Roland  and Kitty Hilder (née Fissenden). Following the outbreak of World War 1, Hilder's English father decided in 1915 to return to his native county of Kent England to enlist in the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rowland Hilder Country|last = Hilder|first = Rowland|publisher = The Herbert Press Ltd|year = 1987|isbn = 0-906969-74-3|location = |pages = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bookroom&gt;{{cite web|title=Rowland Hilder|url=http://www.bookroomartpress.co.uk/biographies/33.html|website=bookroomartpress.co.uk|publisher=Bookroom Art Press|accessdate=27 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205195055/http://www.bookroomartpress.co.uk/biographies/33.html|archivedate=5 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilder studied at [[Goldsmiths' College]], in south London where he met botanical artist Edith Blenkiron (1903-1992). They married and had two children.&lt;ref name=bookroom/&gt; As a student with little money he cycled into Kent and discovered the Shoreham Valley in the North Downs where he was delighted to sketch the same barn drawn by the visionary painter Samuel Palmer in the 1820s. This interest in the countryside began a lifelong passion for drawing landscapes in both pencil and watercolour, initially of Kent, "The Garden of England", and the Thames with its sailing vessels and old buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rowland Hilder's England|last = Hilder|first = Rowland|publisher = The Herbert Press Ltd|year = 1986|isbn = 0-906969-57-3|location = Own library|pages = 7–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilder was commissioned by [[Oxford University Press]] to illustrate books. His decorative end papers and black and white drawings of "Treasure Island" in 1929 won him The Times illustrators award. In the 1930s he illustrated several books. In 1929 Hilder was commissioned by Shell Mex Ltd to illustrate "Then and Now", a travel guide which started a long relationship with the company with posters sponsored by them. In 1953 when asked by the publisher George Rainbird to provide background landscapes to a series of wildflowers by another artist, Hilder showed him pictures of flowers by his wife Edith. Rainbird then commissioned them both to create the Shell "Flowers of the Countryside" series. Demand was so great that Shell set up an office to deal with correspondence and 13 million plates were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rowland Hilder Country|last = Hilder|first = Rowland|publisher = The Herbert Press Ltd|year = 1987|isbn = 0-906969-74-3|location = Own library|pages = 15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been called 'the [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] of his generation',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/theartofwar/artists/hilder_rowland.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' 'The description "Rowland Hilder country" (attached primarily to the [[weald]] of [[Kent]]) evokes a landscape as distinctive and personal as "[[John Constable|Constable's]] country" along the [[River Stour, Suffolk|Suffolk Stour]].'&lt;ref&gt;Denis Thomas, ‘Hilder, Rowland Frederick (1905–1993)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/52112, accessed 30 June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an army Camouflage Officer during the Second World War and then became a mainstay of the Ministry of Information.  {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Hilder served as President of the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolours]] from 1964 to 1974.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Denis|title=Obituary:Rowland Hilder|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-rowland-hilder-1456801.html|website=independent.co.uk|publisher=Independent Newspaper|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;

'''''Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne''''' ({{lang-fr|Les patineurs à Longchamp}}) is an oil-on-canvas landscape painting by the French artist [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], created during the winter of 1868. The painting depicts a snowscape with a large number of Parisians, young and old, spending leisure time on a frozen park lake. Due to Renoir's strong dislike of cold temperatures and snow, the piece is one of his few [[Winter landscapes in Western art|winter landscape]]s.

==Background==
[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] (1841–1919) first met landscape painters [[Alfred Sisley]] (1839–1899), [[Claude Monet]] (1840–1926), and figure painter [[Frédéric Bazille]] (1841–1870) at the [[Atelier|art studio]] of Swiss artist [[Charles Gleyre]] in 1861.  In addition to their friendship, all would prove influential in Renoir's work. For the next several years, Renoir attended the [[École des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref name="moffett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vollard"/&gt;  He first exhibited a large painting at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1863, but destroyed his work. That same year, Renoir was living in a studio with Bazille who introduced him to [[Paul Cézanne]] (1839–1906) and [[Camille Pissarro]] (1830–1903).

An early painting, ''The Cabaret of Mère Anthony'' (1866), represents for Renoir "some of the most agreeable memories" of his life with friends at a village inn during this time.  He soon moved to the village of Chailly near [[Bourron-Marlotte|Marlotte]] and the [[forest of Fontainebleau]], and began working with model [[Lise Tréhot]] who posed for him between 1866 and 1872. Renoir began painting at La Grenouillère, a popular middle class day resort with a floating dance hall, in late 1868.&lt;ref name="moffett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vollard"&gt;Vollard, Ambroise (1925).

Courier Corporation. pp. 9–20. {{ISBN|978-0-486-26488-2}}. {{oclc|23082906}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like Monet and several other Impressionists, Renoir worked ''[[en plein air]]'', painting outdoors, but unlike Monet, who was known for painting in the cold and snow, Renoir was not fond of cold temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Karlins, N. F. (July 7, 1999). "[http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/features/karlins/karlins7-7-99.asp Winter in New York]".  ''Artnet''. Retrieved March 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Years later, he told art dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]] that he could not stand the cold: "But then, even if you can stand the cold, why paint snow?  It is a blight on the face of Nature."&lt;ref name="vollard"/&gt; Although it is unknown when his symptoms began, Renoir was known to suffer from [[rheumatoid arthritis]] from at least 1892 onward, an affliction which would severely restrict his artistic production in late life.&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/315/7123/1704|title=How Renoir coped with rheumatoid arthritis|work=BMJ|accessdate=November 23, 2015|date=December 20, 1997|first=Annelies|last=Boonen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description== 
Renoir, who was then 26 years old, painted ''Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne'' in the public park of [[Bois de Boulogne]] in Paris ''en plein air'' during the cold winter month of January 1868.&lt;ref name="sweeney"/&gt;  Newspaper accounts of the time recorded freezing temperatures allowing people to walk across the [[Seine]] and ice skate on rivers and streams.&lt;ref name="moffett"/&gt;  Due to Renoir's dislike of cold temperatures, it is one of the few winter landscapes he completed aside from a few minor studies.&lt;ref name="aic"&gt;Groom, Gloria. Jill Shaw (ed). (2014). "[https://publications.artic.edu/renoir/reader/paintingsanddrawings#section/135636 Cat. 8 Seascape, 1879: Curatorial Entry]". ''Renoir Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago''. Art Institute of Chicago. Paragraph 2, Footnote 2. {{ISBN|978-0-86559-270-4}}. {{oclc|886893978}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the painting, the park itself was relatively new, with construction beginning in 1852 under a public works program led by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]] under the direction of [[Napoleon III]]. Under [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris#Green space - the parks and gardens of Haussmann|Haussmann's renovation of Paris]],  the Bois de Boulogne was completed in 1858.&lt;ref name="moffett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bailey"&gt;Bailey, Colin B.

The scene is thought to have been painted near the ''Lac pour le patinage'' (Skating Lake), an artificial lake.&lt;ref&gt;Renoir Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago. [https://publications.artic.edu/renoir/reader/paintingsanddrawings#section/135638/135638_anchor Cat. 10  Near the Lake, 1879/80].&lt;/ref&gt; Renoir chose the park because he preferred painting crowds.&lt;ref name="sweeney"&gt;Sweeney, Jim (Jan–Feb 1999). "The Impressionists Paint Winter: A Special Effect". ''Weatherwise'' (Taylor &amp; Francis Group) 52 (1): 22. {{doi|10.1080/00431679909604257}}. {{issn|0043-1672}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting has an unfinished, sketch-like quality to it, in the style of a [[pochade]], but the brushwork is bold and the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] fully realized.&lt;ref name="herbert"/&gt;  The scene represents the western part of the park, using an elevated perspective. The theme evokes older Dutch [[ice skating]] landscapes made popular by painters like [[Hendrick Avercamp]] (1585–1634).&lt;ref name="moffett"&gt;[[The Phillips Collection|Moffett, Charles S.]] (ed).

There are at least four known snowscapes by Renoir: ''Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne'' (1868); ''Winter Landscape'' (1868); ''Snowy Landscape'' (1870–75); and another work also titled ''Snowy Landscape'' (1875).&lt;ref group=note&gt;As cited in ''Renoir: Paintings and drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago'', paragraph 2, footnote 2: "The four known winter scenes are Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne (1868; Collection of William I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3015">The '''Society for Sanity in Art''' was an [[United States|American]] artist's society whose members strongly opposed all forms of [[modern art]], including [[cubism]], [[surrealism]], and [[abstract expressionism]]. In 1939, a western branch of this Society changed its name to the [[Society of Western Artists (1939-Present)|Society of Western Artists]].

== History ==
It was founded in [[Chicago]] in 1936 by [[Josephine Hancock Logan]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and from there it spread all over the country, with major branches in [[Boston]] and [[San Francisco]]. Ms. Logan also published a book entitled ''Sanity in Art'' in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sanity in art|last = Hancock Logan|first = Josephine|publisher = Cornell University|year = 1937|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BG0rGQAACAAJ&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&amp;cad=1_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;span&gt;Branches of the group established themselves all around the United States.&lt;/span&gt;

[[Haig Patigian]] served as president of the group in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Margaret Fitzhugh Browne]] founded the Boston branch of the organization, and led it in protesting a 1940 exhibit of paintings by [[Picasso]] at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,789821,00.html?promoid=googlep ''Sane Boston''] (3 June 1940), Time Magazine. Unattributed author.&lt;/ref&gt; A western branch of the Society changed its name to the [[Society of Western Artists (1939-Present)|Society of Western Artists]] in 1939, and remains to this day the largest society of representational artists in the western United States. The San Francisco branch of The Society for Sanity in the Arts sponsored an annual art exhibit-for-sale by its members at the [[California Palace of the Legion of Honor]] at least as late as 1945.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.societyofwesternartists.com/ Website of the Society of Western Artists]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Artists that support the cause of this group included; William Winthrop Ward, Florence Louise Bryant, [[Percy Gray]], Rudolph F. Ingerle, &lt;/span&gt;[[Frank Montague Moore]]&lt;span&gt;, Thomas Hill; Frank C. Peyraud, &lt;/span&gt;[[Theodore Wores]]&lt;span&gt; and [[Chauncey Foster Ryder]].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.askart.com/askart/lists/Art_Definition.aspx?sl=S|title = Art Glossary - Society for Sanity in Art|date = |accessdate = November 6, 2014|website = AskArt|publisher = |last = |first = }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society gave out awards to artists who met its standards of "sanity"; these awards included the [[Logan Medal of the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,757440-1,00.html ''Sanity &amp; Mrs. Logan''] (22 March 1937), Time Magazine.

'''Spanish Romanesque''' to designate the spatial division of the [[Romanesque art]] corresponding to [[Chronology of the kingdoms on the Iberian peninsula|Hispanic-Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula]] in the 11th and 12th centuries. However, its stylistic features are essentially common to the European Romanesque, and in the particular differentiated between areas that usually subdivided. The southern half of the peninsula lacks of Romanesque art since remained under Muslim rule ([[Hispanic-muslim art|Andalusi art]]). The Romanesque in the central area of the peninsula is low and late, with virtually no presence at south of the Ebro and the Tagus; It is the northern third peninsular the area where are concentrated the Romanesque buildings. In view of the fact that the Romanesque is introduced into the peninsula from east to west, for the purposes of its study, the regional delimitation is done in the same direction: in "eastern kingdoms" (the kingdoms or Pyrenean areas: Catalan Romanesque, Aragonese Romanesque and Navarrese Romanesque), and "western kingdoms" (Castilian-Leonese Romanesque, Asturian Romanesque, Galician Romanesque and Portuguese Romanesque).

The [[First Romanesque]] or Lombard Romanesque has especially presence in Catalonia, while the full Romanesque spread from the foundations of the [[Cluniac Reforms|Order of Cluny]] along the axis of [[Camino de Santiago]]. The late-romanesque continues in the 13th century, especially in rural buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonio Fernández (historian)|Antonio Fernández]], [[Emilio Barnechea]] and [[Juan Haro]], ''History of Art'', Barcelona: Vicens-Vives, 1992, {{ISBN|9788431625542}}, cp. 9, pg. 145-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Romanesque architecture in Spain}}

From the 11th century the European artistic influence (especially Burgundian - [[Monastery of Cluny|Cluny]] - and [[First Romanesque|Lombard monasteries]] - [[Lombard arch]]es -)  was superimposed on local artistic traditions ( called as "[[Pre-Romanesque]] - [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic art]], [[Asturian architecture|Asturian art]], [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic art]] or [[Repoblación art and architecture|Repoblación art]]) and [[Hispanic muslim art|Andalusi art]] or Hispanic Muslim) and lived with the so-called [[Mudéjar]] Romanesque (or "Romanesque of brick", dominant in some areas, such as the center of the Northern Plateau -from Sahagún to Cuéllar-, Toledo or Teruel) giving rise to an art of strong personality.

The chronology in the penetration of architectural forms is visible in a display from east to west, being the first examples in Catalonia ([[Sant Pere de Rodes]], 1022) and developed around [[Camino de Santiago]] those of Aragon ([[Jaca Cathedral|Cathedral of Jaca]], from 1054), Navarre ([[Monastery of Leyre|Leire]], 1057), Castile ([[San Martín de Tours, Fromista|San Martin de Frómista]], 1066) and Leon ([[Basilica of San Isidoro|San Isidoro]] -portico of 1067), ending in Galicia, where it raised the most outstanding work: the [[cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]] (begun in 1075 with the plant of pilgrimage characteristic of most of the churches of the Way, from that of [[Basilica of St. Sernin, Toulouse|St. Sernin of Toulouse]]). The 12th century was the culmination of the style ([[Santa Maria de Ripoll|Monastery of Ripoll]], [[Catalan Romanesque Churches of the Vall de Boí|churches of Boí and Taüll]] -in Catalonia-, [[Loarre Castle|Castle of Loarre]], [[San Juan de la Peña|Monastery of San Juan de la Peña]] -in Aragon, [[Palacio de los Reyes de Navarra, Estella|Palace of the Kings of Navarre (Estella)]], [[Done Mikel eliza (Estella-Lizarra)]], [[Church of Saint Mary of Eunate|Saint Mary of Eunate]], [[San Pedro, Olite|Saint Peter of Olite]] -in Navarre-, Segovian arcaded churches, [[Santo Domingo, Soria|Santo Domingo (Soria)]], [[Monastery of San Juan de Duero|San Juan de Duero]] -in Castile-, [[Cathedral of Zamora]], [[Old Cathedral of Salamanca]] -in Leon-). From the late 12th is identified the transition from Romanesque to Gothic ([[Cathedral of Tarragona]], [[La Seu Vella, Lleida|La Seu Vella (Lleida)]]).&lt;ref&gt;Juan Haro, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Few, but notable are the churches of central plant, which are often associated with models of the Holy Land brought by the military orders (Eunate in Navarre, Vera Cruz in Segovia).&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Gallego, ''Historia del Arte'', Editex, 2009, pg. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest works of the [[Romanesque sculpture]] in the Hispanic-Christian peninsular kingdoms are two beam of the Roussillon area [[Saint-Génis-des-Fontaines]] (dated in 1020)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/v2/obras/19878.htm Ficha en Artehistoria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214001659/http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/v2/obras/19878.htm |date=2013-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Monastery of Sant Andreu de Sureda|Sant Andreu de Sureda]] (which plays its forms). Also from the 11th century are the tympanum of the [[Cathedral of Jaca]], the gables of [[Basilica of San Isidoro|San Isidoro (León)]], the Facade of Pratarías of [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]  (the [[Master Esteban]]), the  cloister of [[Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos|Santo Domingo de Silos]]. In the 12th century emphasizes the facades of [[Santa Maria de Ripoll]], of the [[Church of Santa María la Real, Sangüesa|Andre Maria erreginaren eliza]] (Zangoza/Sangüesa) of the [[Abbey of San Pedro el Viejo|San Pedro el Viejo]] (Huesca) and the cloister of [[San Juan de la Peña|Monastery of San Juan de la Peña]]. In the late 12th century belong the facades of the [[Church of Santa María del Camino (Carrión de los Condes)]] and [[Santo Domingo, Soria|Santo Domingo (Soria)]]. In some works of this period is visible the transition to [[Gothic sculpture|Gothic]]: the apostolate of the [[Cámara Santa|Cámara Santa (Oviedo)]], the facade of [[San Vicente, Ávila|San Vicente (Ávila)]] and [[Portico of Glory]] of Cathedral of Santiago de Cosmpostela (of [[Master Mateo]]).&lt;ref&gt;Juan Haro, op. cit.; Raquel Gallego, ''op. cit.'', pg. 189 y ss.&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the early sculptors of known name is [[Arnau Cadell]] (capitals of the cloister of [[Monastery of Sant Cugat|Sant Cugat]]).

[[File:Pórtico de la Gloria (66231651).jpg|thumb|center|400px|Portico of Glory.]]

The carvings in the round bulge that have been preserved, in polychrome wood, usually have as theme the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ crucified]] in the type called ''[[Majesty (crucifix)|Majesty]]'' and the [[Madonna with Child]] in the type called ''[[Seat of Wisdom|sedes sapientiae]]'' ("Seat of Wisdom"). An exceptional sculpture complex is the ''[[Davallament of Sant Joan de les Abadesses]]'', of transition to the Gothic.&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Gallego, ''op. cit'', pg. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish Romanesque frescoes are outstanding: Pantheon of the Kings of San Isidoro (León) retained 'in situ', or the torn from its places of origin ([[San Baudelio de Berlanga]], [[hermitage of la Vera Cruz (Maderuelo)]] -both in the [[Prado]]- and the collection assembled in the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Juan Haro, ``op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:12th-century unknown painters - Creation Adam and the Original Sin - WGA19757.jpg|thumb|centre|500px|Creation of Adam and Original Sin. Hermitage of la Vera Cruz (Maderuelo).]]

The panel painting produced [[antependium]] that, especially in Catalonia collected the Italian-Byzantine influence from the 12th century (''[[Altar frontal from La Seu d'Urgell or of The Apostles]]''). In later period it evolves to the [[Gothic painting]], of higher capacity narrative and lower stiffness (''[[Altar frontal from Avià]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Gallego, op. cit.'', pg. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Sumptuary arts==

The preparation of manuscripts in the ''[[scriptorium]]'' of monasteries and cathedrals was an out-standing activity, continuing the Mozárabe tradition (Beatus) and incorporating the European influences (''[[Libro de los testamentos]]'', ''[[Tumbos compostelanos]]'', ''[[Codex Calixtinus]]'', etc.) have been retained some outstanding examples of tissues in liturgical vestments and tapestries (''[[Tapestry of Creation]]'' of the Cathedral of Girona) The [[Ivory carving]], of Andalusian influence, played an important workshop at the Leonese court. The [[goldsmith]] produced rich pieces (''[[Cáliz de las Ágatas]] '' or of Doña Urraca -ca 1063-,&lt;ref&gt;[http://domuspucelae.blogspot.com.es/2010/07/visita-virtual-el-caliz-de-dona-urraca.html Virtual tour: THE GOBLET OF DOÑA URRACA, pious donation of the Queen of Zamora]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ark of San Isidoro]]''), including the incorporation of the technique of the [[Limoges enamels]] (''[[Frontal of Santo Domingo de Silos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Gallego, ''op. cit.'', pg. 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Syriac Bible of Paris''' ([[Paris]], [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], MS syr. 341) is an [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[Bible]] written in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. It dates to 6th or 7th century.  It is believed to have been made in northern [[Mesopotamia]].  The manuscript has 246 extant [[Bookbinding|folio]]s. Large sections of text and the accompanying illustrations are missing.  The folios are 312 by 230 mm. For reasons of economy, the text is written in three columns.  

The illumination consists of miniatures introducing each of the books of the Bible and set into one or two of the text columns.  The miniature for the [[Book of Genesis]] which may have been the most sumptuous miniature is missing. Although most of the miniatures are full length author portraits,  some depict scenes from the following book. For example, the miniature before the [[Book of Job]] depicts [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]] on the dung heap.  This miniature combine several scenes from the Book of Job.  Job is pictured lying naked on the dung heap, covered with sores.  Below him his wife is talking to him.  To the left are his three friends.  One of them is seen rending his garments, while the other two are seated, and talking to him.  The [[Book of Exodus]] also has a narrative miniature before it.  It depicts [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]] requesting permission to depart from [[Pharaoh]].  It is hard to understand why this scene, rather than one of the many more popular scenes was chosen to be the sole illustration for Exodus. Other miniatures are allegorical groups. The miniature before the [[Book of Proverbs]] shows the [[Virgin and Child]],  flanked by [[King Solomon|Solomon]], representing the wisdom of the [[Old Testament]], and [[Christian Church|Ecclesia]], a personification of the [[Christian]] Church. Only one [[New Testament]] miniature survives, that of James the Apostle. The miniatures show mixture of [[Hellenistic]] heritage and a native Syriac tradition.  Some of the miniatures, especially the miniature before Exodus, show stylistic similarities to the miniatures in the [[Rabula Gospels]].   Based on this it is unlikely that this manuscript was made much later than the Rabula Gospels which were made in 586.

The manuscript is assumed to have come from the Episcopal library of [[Siirt]] near [[Lake Van]], where it may have been produced.  It has been in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] since 1909.

'''''What We Lose''''' is the debut novel of American author [[Zinzi Clemmons]]. It was loosely based on her own experiences caring for her mother who was dying of cancer. 

==Background==
{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}

Clemmons was a graduate student in the fiction MFA program at [[Columbia University]], working on a novel, when her mother was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. She finished her degree but set aside the novel, instead writing journals of her experiences caring for and ultimately grieving her mother's death. These became the basis of a more experimental project than her unfinished linear novel, a fragmentary and chronologically disrupted "exercise in autofiction".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Plot==
Thandi, the daughter of an [[South Africa]] mother and an American father, comes of age in [[Pennsylvania]]. When she is in college, her mother is stricken by cancer and dies, causing Thandi's life to fall apart as she struggles to process her grief.

Shortly thereafter, Thandi discovers she is pregnant by her boyfriend Peter. She decides to carry the pregnancy to term and has a son she names Mahpee. She and Peter quickly marry and he moves to New York City to be with her and their child. However their marriage quickly falls apart and after she cheats on him, she decides to ask for a separation. 

Thandi begins to forget her mother and slowly begins to heal, though she realizes her mother's death will haunt her for the rest of her life.

==Style==
In ''[[The Guardian]]'', Marta Bausells described ''What We Lose'' as "highly experimental, told in intimate vignettes including blogposts, photos, hand-drawn charts and hip-hop lyrics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/10/zinzi-clemmons-what-we-lose-interview|title=Zinzi Clemmons on her first novel: 'I’m proud of it, because I didn’t hold anything back'|last1=Bausells|first1=Marta|date=August 10, 2017|work=The Guardian|accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', Megan O'Grady notes the book's "boldly innovative and frankly sexual" style, noting "the collage-like novel mixes hand-drawn charts, archival photographs, rap lyrics, sharp disquisitions on the [[Nelson Mandela|Mandelas]] and [[Oscar Pistorius]], and singular meditations on racism’s brutal intimacies."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/zinzi-clemmons-what-we-lose-interview|title=Zinzi Clemmons Has Written the Debut Novel of the Year|last=O'Grady|first=Megan|date=July 20, 2017|work=Vogue|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Grady compared Clemmons to authors like [[Karl Ove Knausgård|Karl Ove Knausgaard]], [[Meghan O'Rourke|Meghan O’Rourke]], and [[Claudia Rankine]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Clemmons cites [[Toni Morrison]]'s ''[[The Bluest Eye]]'' as a significant influence for ''What We Lose''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''Women Speak''''' is a 1988 Chinese article written by [[Beijing]]-based Xiang Ya (向娅) about [[sexual revolution]] in the country as it "[[Chinese economic reform|opened up]]". The piece includes supposedly "tape-recorded" interviews of 10 anonymous urban women in their 30s and 40s, who discussed their highly private love/sex lives and thoughts. It was translated to English by Diana B. Kingsbury in her 1994 translated anthology ''I Wish I Were a Wolf''.

''Women Speak'' was adapted into a 1989 film ''[[Golden Fingernails]]'' directed by Bao Zhifang.

==Author==
Zhao Shaoling (赵绍玲), who used the [[pen name]] Xiang Ya, was born in 1951 in [[Lingshou County]], [[Hebei]]. In 1969, as part of the [[Down to the Countryside Movement]] she was "[[sent-down youth|sent-down]]" to [[Inner Mongolia]] where she worked for 3 years in a rural army unit. In 1974, she was transferred to an electrical equipment plant in [[Beijing]], after which she found employment with the [[National Library of China]]. She attended night school and graduated with a degree in Chinese literature in 1985. She published her first article in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=I Wish I Were a Wolf: The New Voice in Chinese Women's Literature|last=Kingsbury|first=Diana B.|publisher=[[New World Press]]|year=1994|isbn=7-80005-124-2|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The interviews==
Each interview reads like a long monologue, with the interviewer barely present. No names are mentioned. Like the author, all interviewees in the 30s were "sent-down" to work in the countryside during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

*Woman '''A''' ("'''Her husband had a lover, but it worked out in the end'''"), a 36-year-old physician who graduated from medical school in 1983 along with her husband, with whom she has a loving relationship and great sex life. When she discovered her husband's affair 8 years into the marriage, she was not hurt, instead she felt calm and confident. She gently talked to him, said she understood and asked for only honesty. Her magnanimity greatly relieved him, who gratefully returned her trust. She also talked to and comforted his lover. Three years later the younger woman married well, and she is very happy for both marriages.
*Woman '''B''' ("'''Her husband's rising fame fed her fear'''"), a 35-year-old factory worker from a peasant background. Before their marriage, she persistently and unabashedly courted his love. The years right after the wedding were blissful, but recently she has become paranoid about his possible infidelity. Afraid of the attention he gets, she doesn't want him to write or dress up. She stalks him, opens his mail, confronts women around him, and visits his boss, but still feels anxious. He no longer makes love to her, but she'd rather have that than discover his affair. She has access to poison and is ready to kill him if he cheats. 
*Woman '''C''' ("'''She said, 'We are two independent planets, both free to come and go''''"), a 39-year-old company assistant manager. Her first marriage fell apart quickly. Her husband cheated on her, so she did the same to him. Two years later she fell in love with someone and filed for divorce. Her husband refused. Crying and begging, he even surprised her and her lover at night, but she protected her lover from his beating. On the wedding of her second marriage, she pronounced that if one "wants a divorce, the other must not refuse". She believes this made her new hubby value their relationship. They are very happy.
*Woman '''D''' ("'''Conventional love for her is not enough'''"), a 46-year-old department vice-director in a publishing house. She has no problems with her husband—except for sex. As he isn't able to satisfy her, she starts a clandestine affair with a married man who is good in bed. She also has no desire to divorce her husband, a point she made very clear to her lover. Actually, she believes the affair helps her marriage, as she can now vent her sexual frustration periodically without getting angry at her husband. She also believes adulterous lovemaking more exciting and satisfying, another reason she's maintaining the status quo.
*Woman '''E''' ("'''She fell in love with a married man'''"), a 38-year-old middle-school teacher. Her sex life during marriage was terrible, but she took a long time to leave him. After the divorce, she fell in love with a man already separated from his wife for 3 years. Still, she was called a homewrecker and received a disciplinary warning from her job. Without a marriage license, they are also turned away by most hotels. But she believes she did nothing wrong and continues to love him. When he was falsely diagnosed with cancer, she stayed in the hospital with him for 21 days. Eventually people around her became more understanding.
*Woman '''F''' ("'''A woman set on conquering men'''"), a 34-year-old charity organizer. Extremely ugly, she was abused by her parents and brother growing up. She craves for love, but no man paid her attention. Finally she swore vengeance. In 1981, she began the first non-governmental charity organization, and quickly achieved fame and success. During a TV interview, she was overcome with emotions and fainted. She began to have handsome suitors, but her "desire for revenge subsumed any sexual feeling". She repeated rejected two charming men. Now she has a stable plain-looking male partner, but doesn't want to marry.
*Woman '''G''' ("'''Love and sex are two different things'''"), a 38-year-old actress-turned-film director. Because she lost her virginity before marriage, her ex-husband treated her poorly, often beating her up during sex. Initially submissive, she became more confident and developed feminist ideas after working as an actress. After the divorce her career took off, and she started dating again with the intention of remarrying, but only met frivolous men. Disgusted, she has decided that she will never remarry, but she will not give up sex. She despises men, but still leads an active sex life without any commitment.
*Woman '''H''' ("'''Without love, she had to turn him down'''"), a 43-year-old teacher who lost her husband in a terrible accident 5 years ago. Though she has missed him, she is ready to remarry. Two years ago, a good male friend made advances towards her in his apartment, but she rejected him. Although he was still married, he had been separated for years from his wife who had gone abroad. So they were both independent, sexually experienced and very lonely, but it still didn't "feel right", as if something was missing. She has come to realize how important love is to her, and she "can't have sex without love".
*Woman '''I''' ("'''She wants a child but doesn't want to get married'''"), a 34-year-old lower-level cadre in an office. She is not interested in men and has no desire to marry, but wants to have a child. The family planning official finds her unbelievable, but she cites the marriage law as granting equal civil rights for children out of wedlock. She is also frustrated that the government has not allocated a large apartment for her only because she is single. "Why not judge us based on what we've done for society rather than on our marital status?... Why can't I be accorded my proper rights?" She asks angrily.
*Woman '''J''' ("'''A woman preoccupied with proving her virginity'''"), a 37-year-old company section chief. During middle school she accidentally broke her hymen riding a bike. At age 17, she was "sent-down" to rural [[Shaanxi]], where she witnessed the tradition of new brides holding high blood-stained cloth the morning after their weddings to prove that they had been virgins. Since then, she has been terrified she won't bleed if she has sex, and this anxiety effectively keeps her a virgin. Gradually all men lose interest in her, and she has stubbornly vowed to remain a virgin for the rest of her life, having learned to masturbate.
