The Aria Trust is the [[Discretionary trust|family trust]] of the Ahsani family. In 2007 the trust held €63 million in bank accounts and private equity with its international property holdings in Monaco, [[France]], the [[United States]] and [[London]] having an estimated value of €130 million.&lt;ref name=MelAgeWho&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/interactive/2016/the-bribe-factory/day-1/who-are-the-ahsanis.html|title=The Bribe Factory: Who are the Ahsanis?|date=30 March 2016|work=The Melbourne Age|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MelAgeCompany&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/interactive/2016/the-bribe-factory/day-1/the-company-that-bribed-the-world.html|title=The Bribe Factory: Part 1|date=30 March 2016|work=The Melbourne Age|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahsani family have a charitable organisation, Unakids. The Ahsani family control [[shell company|shell companies]] in the tax havens of the [[Channel Islands]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and the [[British Virgin Islands]], through which Unaoil's business is conducted. In March 2016 ''[[The Age]]'' described Unaoil as "the unseen intermediary in massive deals between the world's biggest energy companies and notoriously corrupt governments in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa."&lt;ref name=MelAgeWho/&gt; The family’s portfolio of real estate includes German nursing homes, and properties in multiple countries.&lt;ref name=MelAgeWho/&gt;

==Family members==
Ata Ahsani was born in 1940 in [[Kerman]], Iran, and later studied engineering in England and the United States before working for an oil company in Iran. Ata Ahsani left Iran for the United Kingdom in the wake of the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], and established Unaoil in 1990.&lt;ref name=MelAgeWho/&gt;

Cyrus Ahsani is Ata Ahsani’s oldest son. He is the treasurer of Monaco's Ambassador's Club, the club is headed by [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert II of Monaco]]. 

Saman Ahsani was born in December 1973.&lt;ref name="Companies House"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brokerbox Ltd|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03995070/officers|website=Companies House|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is chairman of the [[Iran Heritage Foundation]], and has established a new Patron’s Circle in this role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curtis|first1=John E.|title=Chief Executive’s Review - Year Ending 31st December 2015|url=http://www.iranheritage.org/ceo-review.html|website=Iranheritage.org|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ata Ahsani's third son, Sassan Ahsani (born January 1978),&lt;ref name="Companies House 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lumina Real Estate Capital Limited|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/05895433/officers|website=Companies House|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based in London and is the head of Lumina Real Estate Capital, a property investment company.

==Description==
Hundreds of thousands of emails sent within Unaoil and between members of the Ahsani family from 2001 to 2012 were leaked to investigative journalists and formed the basis for a series of stories in [[Fairfax Media]]'s ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper and the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' in March 2016. ''The Age'' described Cyrus as "...in charge of day to day operations, though he often defers to his father for big decisions and important interactions" and described his character as "intelligent and good humoured: a man who inspires loyalty".&lt;ref name=MelAgeWho/&gt;

==Biography==
Cherif Guellal attended the university at [[Aix-en-Provence]] in southern [[France]], and graduated in 1956. Taking the lead from his mother, who was a leader in the [[Algeria]]n anti-French [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|resistance movement]], he joined the [[government in exile]]. He worked to build support for the movement, mainly from [[India]].

He served as a key aide to the resistance leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], who became the first [[President of Algeria|president of post-colonial Algeria]]. He was sent to [[Washington, D.C.]], as the new country's first [[Ambassador]] to the [[United States of America|United States]]. His primary role was to protect the Algerian oil interests and handle the independence of Algeria in the cold-war era.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Lakhdar Ghettas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hppNDwAAQBAJ Algeria and the Cold War: International Relations and the Struggle for Autonomy], ''IB Tauris'', 24 November 2017 ({{ISBN|9781786722591}})&lt;/ref&gt; The US-Algeria relations were also tensed by the establishment of the Vietcongs' first mission outside of Vietnam, in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Stolley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7VUEAAAAMBAJ Hertz's unfinished bike race], ''Ĺife Magazine'', 21 July 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Cherif Guellal also had to handle Algeria's official ties with Cuba and the tension it generated within the US diplomatic corps.&lt;ref&gt;Federico Vélez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bT4lDwAAQBAJ Latin American Revolutionaries and the Arab World: From the Suez Canal to the Arab Spring], ''Taylor &amp; Francis'', 15 May 2017 ({{ISBN|9781134804535}})&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1964 speech, he stated «We wish to be masters in our own house and not junior partners of the great powers».&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

In May 1964, after [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was named to the White House, his 12-room French chateau-style house (''The Elms'') was sold to the Algerian government and became the residence of Cherif Guellal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/09/archives/johnson-house-is-bought-for-algerian-ambassador.html Johnson House Is Bought For Algerian Ambassador], ''Nytimes.com'', 9 May 1964&lt;/ref&gt; According to the writer [[Barbara Howar]] in her 1973 memoir ''Laughing All The Way'', Guellal and Johnson both originated from oil-rich states ([[Texas]] for Johnson) and shared a similar mentality towards politics.&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

He outlasted his mentor, remaining in his post following the [[military coup]] that removed Ben Bella from power and installed [[Houari Boumedienne]], the former [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] military chief, in his place.

In Washington, he successfully lobbied for the repeal of racially restrictive covenants on his ambassadorial residence, one impetus for the later, widespread repeal of such covenants.&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

When the [[Arab–Israeli conflict#1967–73|1967 Arab-Israeli war]] broke, Cherif Guellal's term ended. He remained a representative of Algeria's national oil company [[Sonatrach]].&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

Ambassador Guellal died of [[leukemia]] in Algeria on April 7, 2009. He was buried at the [[El Alia Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

==Personal life==
Guellal had a long-term relationship with [[Yolande Fox]], who was [[Miss America]] in 1951 and later an [[opera]] singer. Guellal and Fox led an active social life, frequenting academic meetings and circulating among Washington's social and intellectual elite. His social secretary was [[Sally Quinn]]. Until his death, they raised Fox's grandchild, Yolande Paris Campbell, together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/across-the-nationacross-the-world/2016/washington-social-diary-the-last-of-the-georgetown-dames|title=Washington Social Diary: The Last of the Georgetown Dames|date=29 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''chief commercial officer''' ('''CCO''') (sometime referred to as the [[Chief Business Officer]]) is an executive-level role, with the holder being responsible for the commercial strategy and the development of an [[organization]]. It typically involves activities relating to [[marketing]], [[sales]], [[product development]] and [[customer service]] to drive business growth and [[market share]]. As a corporate officer position, the CCO generally reports directly to the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) and is primarily concerned with ensuring the integrated commercial success of an organization. The role typically must combine technical knowledge of the relevant field with strong marketing and business development skills.

Essentially, a CCO takes ownership of the customer and the customer interface with the product or service offering, making sure that all functions of the organization are aligned to meet its strategic commercial objectives. This means that they are closely linked to the organization's [[strategic management]] function, in drafting, implementing and evaluating cross-functional decisions that will enable an organization to achieve its long-term objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdcexec.com/web/online/Decision-Support-Trends/New-Power-Center-Seen-Emerging-in-C-level-Suite-with-Rise-of-Chief-Commercial-Officer/16$11506|date=July 2009|work=Supply &amp; Demand Chain|title=New Power Center Seen Emerging in C-level Suite with Rise of Chief Commercial Officer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a company such as [[Amazon.com]], the CCO is at the same time the vice-president. This shows the importance that the new economy gives to customer's advice, which then influences services and products through social medias.

'''Dimitri John Chandris''' ({{lang-el|Δημήτρη Ιωάννη Χανδρή}}; born January 1921 - August 1980) was a Greek shipowner who established [[Chandris Line]], a large passenger shipping line, with his brother Anthony Chandris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Theotokas |first1=Ioannis|last2= Harlaftis |first2=Gelina|date=2009 |title= Leadership in World Shipping: Greek Family Firms in International Business |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kGKHDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22I.+Theotokas%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj619uo15jZAhVIa1AKHU-TDgkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|page=126 |isbn= 0230233538}} &lt;/ref&gt; Dimitri Chandris was the eldest son of [[John D. Chandris]], a prominent Greek shipowner.__FORCETOC__

== Early life ==

Dimitri Chandris was born in Chios to a wealthy family, son of Ioannis D. Chandris, a prominent ship-owner, and his wife Evgenia. In 1915, John Chandris had purchased his first ship, ''the S/S Dimitrios'', and founded Chandris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.travelpulse.com/news/features/6-cruise-industry-pioneers.html |title=6 Cruise Industry Pioneers |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=25 June 2014 |website=www.travelpulse.com |publisher=travAlliancemedia |access-date= 9 February 2018|quote=Although Anthony and Dimitri Chandris were responsible for developing Celebrity Cruises, their role in the industry was greatly influenced by the accomplishments of their father, John D. Chandris. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the outbreak of [[World War II]], Dimitri Chandris relocated from [[Chios]] to London with his family, joining a large number of other ship-owning families from Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= Kakissis|first1= Joanna|title= Greek shipping families in the spotlight|url= https://www.ft.com/content/4ee112a6-ab30-11df-9e6b-00144feabdc0|accessdate=9 February 2018|work=Financial Times|date=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All of his ships were requisitioned by the UK government to assist in the war effort.

== Post War ==

At the end of the war, Dimitri set about reconstructing the family business almost from scratch.  He had no alternative but to remain in the U.K. because, although the war might have ended in Europe, Greece became embroiled in a [[Greek Civil War|civil war]].  Greek shipowners, therefore, elected to operate in either of the then two great maritime centres of London and New York.

In 1950, he was elected on to the Board of the Union of Greek Shipowners(UGS). He also served as Vice President of the UGS from 1960 to 1964.  (His brother Anthony later served as President of the UGS).

During the 1960s and 1970s, he was very active with various business interests in Greece including the establishment of the Alpha beer brewery (which became the second largest in Greece), a large motor franchise based on [[Rootes Motors|Rootes cars]] and a substantial hotel group.  He was also involved in several charities including establishment of the ''School of Maritime Engineering'' in his home island of Chios.

== Shipping Career ==

Prior to the outbreak of World War II, Chandris operated six vessels: the passenger ships ''Dimitrios'', ''Chimara'' and ''Corte II'', and the steamers ''Dimitrios II'', ''Vlassios'' and ''Eugenia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=William H.|date=1993 |title= The Chandris Liners |url= http://www.ssaustralishomepage.co.uk/chandris.html|publisher= Carmania Press|page=4 |isbn= 0951865625}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the years following 1945, Dimitri and Anthony Chandris began to develop Chandris into the largest Greek passenger shipping firm.

In 1945, Dimitri Chandris led the acquisition of [[Chandris Line|Charlton Steam Shipping Company Ltd.]], which operated a fleet of passenger vessels from headquarters in Newcastle. This purchase signalled the beginning of the Chandris Group’s concentrated expansion efforts around passenger travel. Recognising the urgent need to provide passenger ships for displaced peoples and refugees in post-War Europe, the Chandris Group purchased the ''Prince David'' and ''Prince Robert'' (pictured right) from the Canadian Royal Navy in 1945. Following rebuilding and conversion, the new vessels were leased by the Chandris Group to the [[International Refugee Organization|International Refugee Organisation]].

More intensive expansion efforts were undertaken from 1959, after which the Chandris Group acquired several large passenger ships, notably the ''[[MV Bloemfontein Castle|RMS Bloemfontein Castle]]'', the ''Bretagne'', and the ''[[SS Lurline]]'' (later renamed the Ellinis).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Smith's Dock Wins Greek Order for Liner Conversion|date=30 September 1963|work=The Financial Times|via=Gale NewsVault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chandris Line ==

In 1950, Dimitri Chandris was elected on to the Board of the Union of Greek Shipowners (UGS), later serving as the organisation’s Vice President from 1960-1964.

By the 1970s, the Chandris Group had developed multifarious activities moving into tankers and tramp ships as well as passenger and cruise ships. By 1976, Chandris had the largest passenger-cruise ship fleet in the world, surpassing the records held by major companies such as [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] and [[Union-Castle Line|Union-Castle]]. An editorial feature in Lloyd’s Review praised the recovery and renaissance of the Greek shipping sector, led by companies and individuals from Chios, writing: ''“It is not surprising, therefore, that a name often mentioned with Greek shipping – Chandris – was born in Chios. Nor is it surprising that the most successful passenger ship operator in modern times should be Chandris.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Lloyd's Review |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Lloyd_s_Review.html?id=ZjjyAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|magazine= Lloyd's Review|location=London |publisher=Lloyd's of London Pres.|date=1976|access-date=9 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==

Having been resident in London since World War II, Dimitri Chandris returned permanently to Greece in July 1980 to work and focus on the hotel group he established. Shortly following his return to Greece, Dimitri was involved in a boating accident. He was transferred to [[The London Clinic]] for medical care but died following an operation. Dimitri was buried in the Chandris family chapel next to the church of Agios Vlasios in [[Chios|Kambos]], Chios.

== Other Ventures ==

Outside of shipping, Dimitri Chandris was involved in a number of other business ventures, establishing a large automotive franchise, a brewery and a substantial hotel group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4092">The '''equity of redemption''' refers to the right of a mortgagor in [[law]] to redeem his or her property once the debt secured by the [[mortgage law|mortgage]] has been discharged.

==Overview==
Historically, a mortgagor (the borrower) and a mortgagee (the lender) executed a conveyance of legal title to the property in favour of the mortgagee as security for the loan.  If the loan was repaid, then the mortgagee would return the property; if the loan was not repaid, then the mortgagee would keep the property in satisfaction of the debt. The equity of redemption was the right to petition the [[Court of equity|courts of equity]] to compel the mortgagee to transfer the property back to the mortgagor once the secured obligation had been performed.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Santley v Wilde]]'' [1899] 2 Ch 474&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most mortgages are granted by [[Security interest#Statutory mortgage|statutory charge]] rather than by a formal conveyance, although theoretically there is usually nothing to stop two parties from executing a mortgage in the more traditional manner.&lt;ref&gt;Some countries have limited the grant of traditional mortgages by statute in some circumstances. For example, in [[England and Wales]] a mortgage of land may only be made by way of statutory charge or demise for a term of years absolute (a lease), see sections 85-86 of the Law of Property Act 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the courts have been astute to ensure that the mortgagee did not introduce any artificial stipulations into the contractual arrangements to impede a mortgagor's ability to satisfy obligations and reclaim the property. Such impediments are "clogs" on the equity of redemption, and the courts of equity were particularly astute&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite bailii|litigants=[[Jones v Morgan]]|year=2001|court=EWCA|division=Civ|num=995}} at para 50.&lt;/ref&gt; in striking down any provision which was, or in later cases, which may be, a clog.

Where [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] is pledged in [[prime brokerage]] transactions, it is common for the broker to rehypothecate the collateral. Concerns remained, however, that because the rehypothecation might theoretically mean that the lender could lose title to the collateral, and thereby possibly be unable to reconvey it to the primary customer, it was speculated that such rehypothecation is possibly unlawful.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The tide has for some years now turned against striking down every clause in a mortgage document that might conceivably impede the right to redeem.&lt;ref&gt;The tide began to turn in ''[[Biggs v Hoddinott]]'' [1898] 2 Ch 307, where it was held that, in a brewery mortgage case, a covenant to take beer from the mortgagee limited to the continuance of the security did not clog the equity of redemption, it being generally realised that an extreme response to perceived clogs undermined the commercial arrangements of the parties.&lt;/ref&gt;

The equity of redemption is itself recognised as a separate species of property, and can be bought, sold or even itself mortgaged by the holder.

Historically the equity of redemption would naturally expire upon the mortgagor breaching the terms of repayment. However, in modern times, extinguishing the equity of redemption (and leaving the mortgagee with absolute title to the property) ordinarily requires a court order in most jurisdictions. For both legal and practical reasons, the use of [[foreclosure]] as a remedy has fallen into disuse.&lt;ref&gt;Foreclosure used to be a mortgagee’s primary remedy, but "it is now rarely sought or granted." see ''[[Palk v Mortgage Services Funding plc]]'' [1993] Ch 330 at 336&lt;/ref&gt;  Even where a mortgagee seeks an order for foreclosure from the courts, the courts will frequently order judicial sale of the property instead.

In [[computer science]], '''event monitoring''' is the process of collecting, analyzing, and [[Signal (information theory)|signaling]] event occurrences to subscribers such as [[operating system]] [[Process (computing)|processes]], active [[database]] rules as well as human operators. These event occurrences may stem from arbitrary sources in both [[software]] or [[computer hardware|hardware]] such as operating systems, [[database management system]]s, [[application software]] and [[Microprocessor|processor]]s. Event monitoring may use a [[time series database]].

== Basic concepts ==
Event monitoring makes use of a [[computer bus|logical bus]] to transport event occurrences from [[communication source|source]]s to [[observation|subscriber]]s, where ''event sources'' signal event occurrences to all event subscribers and ''event subscribers'' receive event occurrences. An event bus can be distributed over a set of physical [[Node (networking)|node]]s such as standalone computer systems. Typical examples of event buses are found in [[graphical user interface|graphical systems]] such as [[X Window System]], [[Microsoft Windows]] as well as development tools such as SDT.

''Event collection'' is the process of collecting event occurrences in a filtered [[Data logging|event log]] for analysis. A ''filtered event log'' is logged event occurrences that can be of meaningful use in the future; this implies that event occurrences can be removed from the filtered event log if they are useless in the future. [[#Event log analysis|''Event log analysis'']] is the process of analyzing the filtered event log to aggregate event occurrences or to decide whether or not an event occurrence should be signalled. ''Event signalling'' is the process of signalling event occurrences over the event bus.

Something that is monitored is denoted the ''monitored object''; for example, an application, an operating system, a database, hardware etc. can be monitored objects. A monitored object must be properly conditioned with event [[sensor]]s to enable event monitoring, that is, an object must be instrumented with event sensors to be a monitored object. ''Event sensors'' are sensors that signal event occurrences whenever an event occurs. Whenever something is monitored, the [[probe effect]] must be managed.

==Monitored objects and the probe effect==
As discussed by Gait,&lt;ref&gt;J. Gait (1985). A debugger for concurrent programs. ''Software-Practice And Experience'', 15(6)&lt;/ref&gt; when an object is monitored, its behavior is changed. In particular, in any [[concurrent system]] in which processes can run in [[parallel computing|parallel]], this poses a particular problem. The reason is that whenever sensors are introduced in the system, processes may execute in a different order. This can cause a problem if, for example, we are trying to localize a [[fault (technology)|fault]], and by monitoring the system we change its behavior in such a way that the fault may not result in a failure; in essence, the fault can be masked by monitoring the system. The ''[[probe effect]]'' is the difference in behavior between a monitored object and its un-instrumented counterpart. 

According to Schütz,&lt;ref&gt;W. Schütz (1994). Fundamental issues in testing distributed real-time systems. ''Real-Time Systems'', 7(2):129–157&lt;/ref&gt; we can avoid, compensate for, or ignore the probe effect. In critical real-time system, in which timeliness (i.e., the ability of a system to meet time constraints such as deadlines) is significant, avoidance is the only option. If we, for example, instrument a system for testing and then remove the instrumentation before delivery, this invalidates the results of most testing based on the complete system. In less critical real-time system (e.g., media-based systems), compensation can be acceptable for, for example, [[Performance test (assessment)|performance testing]]. In non-concurrent systems, ignorance is acceptable, since the behavior with respect to the order of execution is left unchanged.

==Event log analysis==
Event log analysis is known as event composition in [[active database]]s, chronicle recognition in [[artificial intelligence]] and as real-time logic evaluation in real-time systems. Essentially, event log analysis is used for [[pattern matching]], filtering of event occurrences, and aggregation of event occurrences into composite event occurrences. Commonly, [[dynamic programming]] strategies from [[algorithm]]s are employed to save results of previous analyses for future use, since, for example, the same pattern may be match with the same event occurrences in several consecutive analysis processing. In contrast to [[general rule processing]] (employed to assert new facts from other facts, cf. [[inference engine]]) that is usually based on [[backtracking]] techniques, event log analysis algorithms are commonly [[greedy algorithm|greedy]]; for example, when a composite is said to have occurred, this fact is never revoked as may be done in a backtracking based algorithm.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for event log analysis: [[finite state automata]], [[Petri nets]], [[procedural programming|procedural]] (either based on an imperative programming language or an object-oriented programming languages), a modification of [[Boyer–Moore string search algorithm]], and simple [[temporal network]]s.

Anchored by [[Jenna Lee]] and [[Connell McShane]], it was the first show to be aired on the [[Television network|network]] when it launched October 15, 2007.  [[Nicole Petallides]] served as Jenna Lee's original co-anchor before she was replaced with McShane on May 12, 2008.

Originally airing as a one-hour program, ''Fox Business Morning'' expanded to two hours on May 12, 2008.  The second hour of this program replaced the first hour of ''[[Money for Breakfast]]'', which in turn, contracted to two hours. ''Fox Business Morning'' once again contracted to 1 hour on October 5, 2009 to make way for ''[[Imus in the Morning]].'' The show was canceled May 7, 2010 and was replaced by a ''Best of Imus in the Morning'' hour at 5am ET, an hour before the live Imus broadcast at 6am ET.&lt;ref&gt;http://insidecablenews.wordpress.com/2010/05/07/more-fbn-changes/&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar early-morning business program, ''[[FBN:AM]]'' (co-anchored by Casone and [[Lauren Simonetti]]), debuted June 1, 2015 after ''Imus in the Morning'' ended its run on the network at the end of May of that year. 

==Format==

In addition, this program also previewed the U.S. business day, including that day's corporate and economic diaries.

*'''The Lead:''' A look at the business day's lead story, seen at the start of each half-hour.
*'''Instant Audit:'''
*'''World Market Report:''' A look at the overseas stock markets, including a review of the trading day in Asia (from [[Sky News Business Channel]]) and ongoing trading in Europe from Ashley Webster.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2470">'''Gross Enrollment Ratio''' ('''GER''') or '''Gross Enrollment Index''' ('''GEI''') is a [[statistics|statistical measure]] used in the [[education]] sector, and formerly by the [[UN]] in its [[Education Index]], to determine the number of students enrolled in school at several different grade levels (like elementary, middle school and high school), and use it to show the ratio of the number of students who live in that country to those who qualify for the particular grade level. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO), describes ‘Gross Enrolment Ratio’ as the total enrolment within a country ‘in a specific level of education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population in the official age group corresponding to this level of education.’&lt;ref&gt;Official UN definition for GER&lt;/ref&gt;

The GER can be over 100% as it includes students who may be older or younger than the official age group. For instance, the GER includes students who are repeating a grade, those who enrolled late and are older than their classmates, or those who have advanced quickly and are younger than their classmates. This allows the total enrollment to exceed the population that corresponds to that level of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/114955-how-can-gross-school-enrollment-ratios-be-over-100|title=How can gross school enrollment ratios be over 100 percent? – World Bank Data Help Desk|website=datahelpdesk.worldbank.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UN Human Development Index use==

A combined gross enrolment ratio (CGER), incorporating all three levels of education, was used to calculate the [[Human Development Index|Human Development Index (HDI)]], an annual [[measuring well-being|gauge of well-being]] for [[United Nations|UN]] [[United Nations member states|member states]], from 1990 to 2009. Amongst  other measures used in the calculation, the CGER was given one-third weight in assessing the [[knowledge]] component, represented by gross enrolment, while the adult [[literacy]] rate was given two-thirds weight.&lt;ref&gt;http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/pdfs/report/Techinical_notes.pdf page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henrique de Araújo de Sommer''' ([[Lisbon]], 29 January 1886 &amp;mdash; [[Cascais]], 28 March 1944) was one of Portugal's most important industrialists.

He was a member of a German aristocratic family living in [[Portugal]], since his grandfather Heinrich Baron von Sommer joined the armies of D. [[Pedro IV of Portugal]], married a Portuguese lady and started a company - Casa Sommer &amp; Cia. dedicated to importing iron.

Henrique de Sommer, after commercial studies in England, was called at the age of 26 to manage his family businesses.

He started the production of Portland cement at the Maceira Liz factory in 1923, being still remembered for his social work, and the out of ordinary working conditions for the factory workers.

With the acquisition of the Companhia de Cimentos Tejo in 1935 he became Portugal's main cement producer.

He experimented with the Basset method of iron ingot, but met with little success, having set along with a project of expansion of his cement production to Mozambique the path that would later be followed by his nephew [[António Champalimaud]].

He had no children, and the division of his inheritance among his nephews and niece was sadly known as the Sommer Inheritance Case, the longest lawsuit in Portuguese history.

'''Jim Liautaud''' (October 19, 1936 – October 23, 2015) was an [[industrialist]], [[inventor]] and [[business theorist]]. He is the father of [[Jimmy John's]] founder [[Jimmy John Liautaud]].  Liautaud provided his son with the seed money to start his restaurant business in 1983.&lt;ref name="The Chicago Tribune: Elgin-area industrialist James Liautaud lived a fast life — in many ways"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gathman|first1=Dave|title=Elgin-area industrialist James Liautaud lived a fast life — in many ways|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/elgin-courier-news/news/ct-ecn-elgin-liautaud-st-1106-20151113-story.html|website=The Courier-News|publisher=The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=9 June 2016|date=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Business===
He began his business career as a [[door-to-door salesman]] selling books for the [[Grolier Encyclopedia]] company.&lt;ref name="The Chicago Tribune: Elgin-area industrialist James Liautaud lived a fast life — in many ways" /&gt;  He founded a company while still in college; negotiating with [[Time Life]] to sell their magazines on campus, and ended up hiring 150 salespeople.&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal: Profiles in Later Life" /&gt;

During the late 1960s Liautaud became a pioneer of a new technology called composite molding. He became the president and co-owner of the Capsonic Group in 1968,&lt;ref name="Distinguished Alumni Awards" /&gt;  which manufactured plastics and electronics in Elgin, Illinois. Being African American, Liautaud was one of the top minority executives in Chicago at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20151031/BLOGS03/151039965/father-of-jimmy-johns-owner-dies-helped-found-business |title=Father of Jimmy John's owner dies, helped found business}}&lt;/ref&gt; He launched other companies in [[Elgin, Illinois|Elgin]] over the years, including American Antenna Company, which made the equipment for the citizens’ band radio industry, and K40 Electronics, which built a [[radar detector]] designed to allow drivers to detect when their speed was being monitored by police.

With the money that Liautaud gave his son to start his own business, James John Liautaud (Jimmy John) was able to begin Jimmy John’s sandwich stores.&lt;ref name="Daily Herald: Jimmy John's founder recalls dad's zest for life" /&gt;  He is the founder of Gabriel, Inc.&lt;ref name="Distinguished Alumni Awards" /&gt;  He also was the founding Investor in two [[insurance companies]], Raffles and National Interstate;{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  and [[Blue Rhino]],&lt;ref name="The Chicago Tribune: Elgin-area industrialist James Liautaud lived a fast life — in many ways" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Securities and Exchange Commission"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 BLUE RHINO CORPORATION|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=612780|publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=9 June 2016|date=10 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;   a [[gas distribution]] company. The latter two are now [[public companies]]. In all, Liautaud started and ran five companies before reaching his mid-50s.&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal: Profiles in Later Life" /&gt;

When he reached age 55, Liautaud had an “epiphany,” and took a two-year sabbatical after selling off his companies. He toured the US by motorcycle, read books on history, psychology and sociology.

The report viewed Universities as enterprises not unlike a factory, and in which students were the customer.{{Fact|date=July 2009}} Concomitantly, academics were viewed less as a self-governing group seeking to expand knowledge and more as shop-floor deliverers of education, subject to performance indicators. Organizational-functions, similarly, were viewed as need dedicated managers, with transfer of these roles from academics to these managers. The adoption of the report led to the abolition of academic tenure.{{Fact|date=July 2009}} It has been argued that the report thus laid the ground for the increase of managerialism in the academy.&lt;ref name="Alderman2009"&gt; [[Geoffrey Alderman]], ''[[Times Higher Education]]'', 30 July 2009.

Located in [[Menlo Park, California]], Kleiner Perkins had access to the growing technology industries in the area. By the early 1970s, there were many [[semiconductor]] companies based in the [[Santa Clara Valley]] as well as early computer firms using their devices and programming and service companies.  Venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in 1974, when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund.  Nevertheless, the firm was still active in this period.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} By 1996, Kleiner Perkins had handed out $880 million in funding to around 260 companies.&lt;ref name=corcoran-perkins/&gt; Beyond the original founders, notable members of the firm  have included individuals such as&lt;ref name=team-kpcb&gt;{{cite news |title=Team |url=http://www.kpcb.com/teams |newspaper= |location=KPCB |access-date= May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Doerr]],&lt;ref name="Kaplan_mentions_Doerr_page_301-302"&gt;

He was an interpreter with the [[France|French]] ambassador to [[Switzerland]], then the General Treasurer of the Ligues Suisses and [[Grisons]].

'''Maria Sigrid Astrid Borelius''' is a Swedish born former [[Minister for Foreign Trade (Sweden)|Minister for Foreign Trade]], [[Science journalist]] and [[entrepreneur]], working as advisor to global companies, academies and institutions. Maria is a member of the advisory council of [[Open Europe]], a European think tank with offices in London, Brussels and Berlin promoting ideas for economic and political reform of the European Union. Maria is also a Partner with Living Waters, a [[London]]-based consultancy focusing on CSR, public affairs and developing fundraising strategies. She is an advisor to the [[Karolinska Institute]], which awards the Nobel prize in medicine, and to [[Lund University]] and works as a columnist with the Swedish business daily, [[Dagens Industri]], mainly covering areas of Entrepreneurship, Science, research, globalization and politics.

== Education and career ==
Between 2007 and 2012 Maria Borelius was the Vice Chairman and CEO of Hand in hand International, a UK based charity, working with partnering organisations in the developing world to promote enterprise and job-creation among marginalized women in the bottom billion. During these years the organisations in India, South-Africa, Afghanistan and India grew from 150,000 women in programs, to over 1 million women, with an international fundraising organization being created with UN partnership, and donors among businesses, private individuals and bilateral institutions.

Maria Borelius has been active on several boards of listed companies on the Swedish stock exchange, with a focus on technology companies such as Active Biotech, Sweco and [[Telelogic]], and within academia, such as the Swedish National Science board.

In 2006 stood for Election for the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Moderate Party]], on an agenda of promoting entrepreneurship and strengthening schools and universities. Maria Borelius was elected a Member of Parliament from the [[Stockholm County]], and became [[Minister for Foreign Trade (Sweden)|Minister for Foreign Trade]] in the centre-right government that was formed after the election. Within a few weeks two ministers had resigned, and Borelius was one of them. She admitted that she during the 1990s, when her four children were small, had used child-care without reporting to the tax authorities and paying the full 32% social fees, and in the media frenzy that followed, resigned. The [[Swedish Government]] has since then changed the system by which private child care is partly paid through the so-called “RUT” reforms.

Together with TV-entrepreneur Annie Wegelius, she started the digital TV-channel and learning portal K-World.

Before this Maria Borelius was active as science [[journalist]], and editor for the evening news “Rapport” on [[Sveriges Television|Swedish national public TV]], and the face of the science program NOVA for many years. She produced numerous TV-programs on popular science, such as “To give birth” which got record audiences. She has written several books on popular medicine, such as “Sedan du fött”, translated into German, Norwegian and Danish, and “Motboken” with Marie Bloom. In 2013 Maria joined the advisory council of [[Open Europe]].

Maria Borelius has lived in Great Britain since 2000, is married to Greger Larson, and has four children born 1990, 1992, 1993 and 1995.

== Education ==
* New York University 1986 (Master of Science Reporting)
* Lund University 1984 (Fil.kand in Biology, mathematics and physics)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11142">Municipally owned corporations are [[corporations]] owned by [[municipalities]]. They are typically "organisations with independent corporate status, managed by an [[executive board]] appointed primarily by [[local government]] officials, and with majority public ownership."&lt;ref name=Voornetal&gt;{{cite web|last=Voorn, Bart, Marieke L. Van Genugten, and Sandra Van Thiel (2017)|title=The efficiency and effectiveness of municipally owned corporations: A systematic review|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03003930.2017.1319360|publisher=Local Government Studies, 43(5): 820-841.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some municipally owned corporations rely on revenue from [[user fees]], distinguishing them from [[Government agency|agencies]] and [[special districts]] funded through [[taxation]].&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes&gt;{{cite web|last=Tavares, Antonio F., and Pedro J. Camões (2007)|title=Local service delivery choices in Portugal: A political transaction costs network|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03003930701417544|publisher=Local Government Studies, 33(4): 535-553.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipally owned corporations may also differ from local bureaucracies in funding, transaction costs, financial scrutiny, labour rights, permission to operate outside their jurisdiction, and, under some circumstances, in rights to make profits and risk of bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=BelFageda10&gt;{{cite web|last=Bel, Germa, and Xavier Fageda (2010)|title=Partial Privatization in Local Service Delivery: An Empirical Analysis of the Choice of Mixed Firms|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03003930903435856|publisher=Local Government Studies, 36(1): 129-149.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes and effects of municipally owned corporations are posited to be different from those of [[state-owned enterprises]]. [[Corporatization]] may be more utilised locally than nationally a way to allow hybrid or flexible forms of public service delivery such as [[public-private partnerships]] and [[inter-municipal cooperation]]. It also allows charging user fees.&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt; Effects can be different because of lower regulator expertise, lower contracting capacity for municipalities,&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt;&lt;ref name=BrownPotoski /&gt; and the higher presence of scale economies. Current research shows that municipally owned corporations are frequently more efficient than [[bureaucracy]] but have higher failure rates because of their legal and managerial [[autonomy]].&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt; An additional problem is the fact that municipally owned corporations often have more than one municipal owner, and conflict between municipal owners can lead to reduced output for the municipally owned corporation due to various negative spillovers.&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327833751_Background_Autonomy_Steering_and_Corporate_Governance_Determinants_of_the_Effectiveness_of_Governance_of_Municipal_Corporations|title= Background, Autonomy, Steering, and Corporate Governance: Determinants of the Effectiveness of (Governance of) Municipal Corporations|last=Voorn, Bart, Marieke van Genugten, and Sandra van Thiel (2018)|publisher=Lausanne: EGPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Under [[New Public Management]], [[corporatization]] became prominent as a step towards (partial) [[privatization]].&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540962.2018.1527533|title=Debate: Corporatization as more than a recent crisis-driven development|last=Voorn, Bart, Sandra Van Thiel, and Marieke van Genugten (2018)|publisher=Public Money &amp; Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon became an end in itself, aiming to combine government control with efficient, businesslike service delivery that was considered lacking in bureaucratic service delivery. The [[state-owned enterprise]]s that resulted were to be organized akin to private corporations, with the difference that the company's shares remain state ownership are not traded on the [[stock market]].&lt;ref name="Marra"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alessandro_Marra2/publication/4732914_Internal_Regulation_by_Mixed_Enterprises_The_Case_of_the_Italian_Water_Sector/links/0deec529a2526c7663000000/Internal-Regulation-by-Mixed-Enterprises-The-Case-of-the-Italian-Water-Sector.pdf|title=Internal regulation by mixed enterprises: the case of the Italian water sector|last=Marra, Alessandro (2007)|publisher=Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 78(2): 245-275.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This also became a trend at the local level. Municipal corporation followed a process of [[externalization]] that required new skills and orientations from the respective local governments, and followed common changes in the institutional landscape of [[public services]].&lt;ref name=GrossiReichard&gt;{{cite web|last=Grossi, Giuseppe, and Christoph Reichard (2008)|title=Municipal corporatization in Germany and Italy|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14719030802264275|publisher=Public Management Review, 10(5): 597-617}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a substantial growth in the number of municipally owned corporations in the 1990s and 2000s throughout Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt;&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferryetal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540962.2018.1486629|title=New development: Corporatization of local authorities in England in the wake of austerity 2010–2016|last=Ferry, Laurence, Rhys Andrews, Chris Skelcher, and Piotr Wegorowski (2018)|publisher=Public Money &amp; Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FlorioFecher2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/blaannpce/v_3a82_3ay_3a2011_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a361-373.htm|title=The future of public enterprises: Contributions to a new discourse|last=Florio, Massimo, and Fabienne Fecher (2011)|publisher=Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 82(4): 361-373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons and effects ==
Municipal corporatization can be used to improve efficiency of public service delivery (with mixed successes) or as a step towards (partial) privatization or hybridization. Its reasons and effects are somewhat similar as those of [[corporatization]].&lt;ref name=Voornetal18 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferryetal /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tavares&gt;{{cite web|last=António F. Tavares (2017)|title=Ten years after: revisiting the determinants of the adoption of municipal corporations for local service delivery|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03003930.2017.1356723|publisher=Local Government Studies, 43(5): 697-706.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== (Potentially) improving efficiency ===
A key purpose of corporatization is externalization.&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt; Such externalization gives the service delivery organization legal and managerial autonomy from politicians, which could potentially increase efficiency, because it safeguards the firm from political exploitation. However, it can also fail to bring efficiency (or cause inefficiency), because this autonomy also reduces the government's ability to monitor its management. Whether corporatization is beneficial may depend on the nature of the service that is corporatized, where autonomy may be less beneficial for more politicized and complex services.&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt; At the local level there may also be higher transaction costs, because contracting capacity may be lower.&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt;&lt;ref name=BrownPotoski&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown, Trevor, and Matthew Potoski (2003)|title=Transaction Costs and Institutional Explanations for Government Service Production Decisions|url=http://spa.hust.edu.cn/2008/uploadfile/2009-9/20090910194210575.pdf|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Step towards privatization or hybridization ===
Once a service has been corporatised, it is often relatively easy to (partially) privatise it by selling some or all of the company's shares via the stock market.&lt;ref name="Marra" /&gt; Thus corporatisation can be a stop on the way towards (partial) privatization.&lt;ref name="Marra" /&gt; Corporatization also can be a step towards the creation of [[hybrid organization|hybrid]] forms of organization, such as institutional private-partnerships or inter-municipal service organizations, which are especially relevant at the local level because of opportunities to capture scale economies.&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt;

=== Alleviating fiscal stress ===
Municipal corporations tend to be established by local governments experiencing some degree of fiscal stress.&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferryetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tavares /&gt;&lt;ref name=Citroni&gt;{{cite web|last=Citroni, Giulio, Andrea Lippi, and Stefania Profeti (2013)|title=Remapping the State: Inter-Municipal Cooperation through Corporatisation and Public-Private Governance Structures|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/03003930.2012.707615|publisher=Local Government Studies, 39(2): 208-234.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorensen&gt;{{cite web|last=Sorensen, Rune J. (2007)|title=Does dispersed public ownership impair efficiency? The case of refuse collection in Norway|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.551.5414&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|publisher=Public Administration,85(4): 1045-1058.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporatization was a way to allow local governments to "hide their liabilities by allocating them partly to their companies" or "corporatized their utilities (…) to raise new sources of income from their companies."&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;

== Problems with multiple ownership ==
The frequent ownership of municipally owned corporations by multiple municipalities can cause problems, the so-called 'multiple principal problem', that can lead these to be inefficient&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b" /&gt; or have high failure rates.&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt; There can be free-riding or duplication in steering and monitoring procedures, resulting in high costs. If there is heterogeneity in interests between the multiple municipalities, there may be directive ambiguity or lobbying of the corporations by individual municipalities, leading to high inefficiency. Delegating governance to one elected party may be a way to solve this problem.&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b" /&gt;

== Usage ==
Municipal corporatization is more prominent for some services than for others. It is typically prominent in:&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b" /&gt;

The '''Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada''' ('''MFDA''') is a Canadian [[self-regulatory organization]] (SRO) that provides oversight to dealers that distribute [[mutual funds]] and exempt [[fixed income]] products.  It is licensed under all Canadian provincial securities regulators (except Quebec, where it cooperates with the  [[Autorité des marchés financiers (Québec)|AMF]] instead).  Its members consist of the distribution side of the industry that typically provide mutual funds and exempt fixed income products to Canadians through [[financial planners]].

It works in parallel to another Canadian SRO, the [[Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada]] (IIROC), which is responsible for the distribution of equities, [[Exchange-traded fund|ETF]]s, and other exchange traded products such as [[closed-end fund]]s.

==History==
The MFDA was created in June 1998 through an initiative by the [[Canadian Securities Administrators]] (CSA) in response to the rapid growth of mutual funds in Canada in the late 1980s.

As of July 2013, it represented 115 mutual fund dealerships. These dealerships represent 81,134 salespeople, and 359.4 Billion dollars in investor assets, commonly referred to as Assets under Administration (AUA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mfda.ca/members/memberstats.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and structure==
The MFDA regulates the operations, standards of practice and business conduct of its Members and their representatives with a mandate to enhance investor protection and strengthen public confidence in the Canadian mutual fund industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mfda.ca/&lt;/ref&gt;

The mutual fund Dealerships collectively and formally represent themselves to the MFDA through the Federation of Mutual Fund Dealers [http://fmfd.ca/ FMFD].

{{Administrative levels and divisions of China sidebar}}
The '''new areas''' or '''new districts''' of the [[People's Republic of China]] are new urban districts that are given special economic and development support by the [[Central government of the People's Republic of China|central government]] or regional government. New areas are divided into two varieties: administrative or management and further divided into levels: state-level, provincial-level, and prefectural-level.

==State-level new areas==
{{Infobox Chinese|title=State-level new areas|s=国家级新区|t=國家級新區|p=Guójiājí Xīnqū|l={{nowrap|national-level new area}}|s2={{nowrap|国家级开放开发新区}}|t2=國家級開放開發新區|p2=Guójiājí Kāifàng Kāifā Xīnqū|l2=national-level open development new area}}
The State-level new areas of the [[People's Republic of China]] are special economic-development zones supported by the central government. The zones are parts of cities at various levels in the formal hierarchy but are known as "national-level" or "state-level" in reference to the preferential policies and privileges they are granted directly by the State Council. These privileges are to encourage and attract new developments (particularly [[foreign direct investment]]) to speed up the city's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liu|first=Qiang|script-title=zh:副省级新区建设风起：行政区划调整或将解冻？|url=http://finance.ifeng.com/news/region/20110917/4608846.shtml|work= 21st century economic report ({{noitalic|{{lang|zh-hans|21世纪经济报道}}) |publisher=Ifeng Finance |accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Poznań University of Economics and Business''' is one of the business schools in Poland.

The Poznań University of Economics and Business (PUEB) is an academic institution in the western part of the country attracting students from many parts of Poland. It is the biggest and oldest business university in the region of Wielkopolska.

The main campus of the university is located in Poznań, but the University offers its courses also in seven other locations (colleges of higher education) situated within a distance of 30–100&amp;nbsp;km from Poznań ([[Bydgoszcz]], [[Kalisz]], [[Konin]], [[Piła]], [[Leszno]], [[Zielona Góra]], [[Szamotuły]]).
 
== History ==
The university's origin goes back to 1926, when the Foundation of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry founded the College of Commerce. As a private school, it had no authority to grant degrees. The school was given the authority in 1938 and, in the same year, was named the Academy of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;http://ue.poznan.pl/en/university,c13/about-pue,c28/pue-history,c42/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, there were 2026 students attending the [[Academy]]. In that year, the Academy was taken over by the state and renamed the Higher School of Economics, initially with two faculties, then three. In 1954, the University ran uniform five-year courses leading to a master's degree.

In 1974, the school was named the Academy of Economics and was granted the authority to award the degrees of doctor and [[habilitated]] doctor (both of economic sciences).

In 1990, the Poznań Academy of Economics fundamentally restructured its faculties, courses, specialisations and curricula. While the years 1998-2000 witnessed a further growth in the number of students. Changes in syllabuses make it possible to aim at European educational standards in all major fields of training and specialisation.

On December 27, 2008, the school was formally granted the status of a university and given its current name - University of Economics in Poznań. Starting 1 October 2015 our University changed its name into Poznań University of Economics and Business.&lt;ref name="changename" /&gt;

== Offers ==
Presently, PUEB specialises in educating economists, managers and specialists in quality management in all sectors of the economy. It offers all academic degrees: Master of Arts, Master of Science, Doctorate and Habilitation (mgr, dr, dr hab.) in three study modes (day, evening and extramural). The University expands its post-master programmes in order to meet the growing demand from those who are already professionally active. During the academic year 2000/2001, the University introduced the [[European Credit Transfer System]] (ECTS) at the Faculty of Management, the Faculty of Economics and the Faculty of Commodity Science.

== Students ==
In the academic year 2014/2015, 10,159 students have enrolled,&lt;ref name="liczbastudentow" /&gt; although, in the academic year 2010/2011, there were altogether app. 15,000 students enrolled.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ue.poznan.pl/home-international-cooperation-and-exchange/poznan-university-of-economics/&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Students ==
For international students, the University has developed courses in English,  French, German and Russian as well as Polish language course for beginners. The courses in foreign languages are also available for Polish students, who are thus given an opportunity to develop their language skills and prepare for studies abroad.

== Research ==
The main subjects of research range from various aspects of Poland’s economic transformation to the preparation of Polish enterprises for competition within the European Union and the globalization trends in the world economy. Product and organisational innovations are those subjects of research which the Poznań University of Economics intends to develop further in close co-operation with Polish enterprises. PUE also focuses on international market research (primarily the EU, but also Central and East European countries) in order to facilitate the expansion of Poland’s export trade.

== University Ranking ==
In terms of enrolment as well as scientific and academic potential, the Poznań University of Economics ranks among the leading economic universities in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perspektywy.pl/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=916&amp;catid=107&amp;Itemid=244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polityka.pl"&gt;http://www.polityka.pl/nauka/_resource/multimedium/20034495&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ranking.perspektywy.org"&gt;http://www.ranking.perspektywy.org/2014/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1:rankingi-2014-tabele&amp;catid=2&amp;Itemid=104&amp;idRanking=50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ue.poznan.pl/pl/aktualnosci,c16/aktualnosci,c15/sukces-uep-w-rankingach-eduniversal,a6102.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, the University has become second in rankings published by such Polish magazines as Polityka, Rzeczpospolita, Perspektywy, Magazyn Businessman and  Newsweek Polska.&lt;ref name="polityka.pl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ranking.perspektywy.org"/&gt;

A '''Purchasing Manager''' is an employee within a [[company]], [[business]] or other [[organization]] who is responsible at some level for buying or approving the acquisition of goods and services needed by the company. Responsible for buying the best quality products, goods and services for their company at the most competitive prices, purchasing managers work in a wide range of sectors for many different organizations. The position responsibilities may be the same as that of a [[buyer]] or purchasing agent, or may include wider supervisory or managerial responsibilities. A Purchasing Manager may oversee the acquisition of materials needed for [[Manufacturing|production]], general supplies for offices and facilities, equipment, or construction contracts. A Purchasing Manager often supervises purchasing agents and buyers, but in small companies the Purchasing Manager may also be the purchasing agent or buyer. The '''Purchasing Manager''' position may also carry the title "'''Procurement Manager'''" or in the public sector, "'''Procurement Officer'''". He or she can come from both an Engineering or Economics background.

A Purchasing Manager's responsibilities may include:
* seeking reliable [[vendor (supply chain)|vendors]] or suppliers to provide quality goods at reasonable prices
* negotiating prices and contracts
* reviewing technical specifications for [[raw materials]], components, equipment or buildings
* determining quantity and timing of deliveries (more commonly in small companies)
* forecasting upcoming demand.

[[File:R. Barr Smith.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''Robert Barr Smith''' (4 February 1824 – 20 November 1915) was an [[Australia]]n businessman and [[philanthropist]].&lt;ref name=adb&gt;van Dissel, Dirk (1976). [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A060175b.htm 'Smith, Robert Barr (1824-1915)']. [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 6, Melbourne University Press, pp 153-154. Retrieved on 20 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was born at [[Lochwinnoch]], [[Renfrewshire]], [[Scotland]], the son of the Rev. Dr Robert Smith, a [[Church of Scotland]] minister, and his wife Marjory, ''née'' Barr.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

Smith studied for a time at the [[University of Glasgow]], but went into business and afterwards emigrated to [[Melbourne]], where he was a member of the firm of Hamilton, Smith and Company in 1854. In 1855 he joined Elder and Company at Adelaide and became a partner in the business which from 1863 was known as '''Elder Smith and Company''',&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; now [[Elders Limited]].

Smith also took up land and became a large owner in [[South Australia]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]]. When the [[Wallaroo, South Australia|Wallaroo]] and [[Moonta, South Australia|Moonta]] [[copper]] mines got into difficulties, Elder Smith and Company made large advances to them until more profitable times came.

Smith made a name for himself as a financial authority, and though he declined to enter political or municipal life, his advice was frequently sought by politicians and members of the business community of [[Adelaide]]. It has been stated that in the 1893 bank crisis he was besieged by crowds of people seeking guidance.&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=Robert Barr |Last=Smith|shortlink=0-dict-biogSa-Sp.html#smith10|accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was on the boards of the public library and of the botanic gardens and was a director of several companies. He was a keen judge and lover of horses, his colours were frequently seen at race meetings in South Australia and Victoria, and he was president for a time of the [[South Australian Coursing Club]].

[[File:UofAdelaide-BarrSmithLibrary-Aug08.jpg|thumb|Barr Smith Library, [[University of Adelaide]].]]

Smith's private charities were very great, and he received a large amount of ''begging-letter'' mail. These letters were dealt with systematically and all deserving cases were helped.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; Smith was a member of the Council of the University of Adelaide for nineteen years.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Among the larger sums distributed were £9000 to buy books for the [[University of Adelaide]] library, £10,000 to complete the St. Peter's Cathedral spires, £3500 for a steam life-boat and in 1908, £2300 to pay off debts on the Trades Hall.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Smith contributed largely to exploration funds, the observatory established on [[Mount Kosciuszko]] was paid for by him, and he was mainly responsible for the expenses of the first South Australian rifle team sent to [[Bisley, Surrey|Bisley]].

Smith died of senile decay on 20 November 1915.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; He married Joanna Elder, sister of Sir [[Thomas Elder]], who survived him with a son and three daughters. Smith was an upright and modest man with intellectual sympathies. Smith shrank from publicity and he was said to have refused the offer of a [[knighthood]].  In 1920 his family gave £11,000 for the endowment of the library of the University of Adelaide and in 1928 his son, [[Tom Elder Barr Smith]], born in 1863, gave £30,000 for the Barr Smith library building.

'''Roland Duchâtelet''' ({{IPA-fr|dyʃɑtlɛ|lang}}; born 14 November 1946) is a Belgian millionaire businessman who turned his [[progressive liberalism|progressive liberal]] ideology into a political movement that he called [[Vivant]]. He also owns four football clubs: [[FC Carl Zeiss Jena|Carl Zeiss Jena]], [[AD Alcorcon|Alcorcon]],  [[Újpest FC|Újpest]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adalcorcon.com/index.php/the-news/2326-comunicado-oficial-de-la-ad-alcorcon|title=Official statement AD Alcorcon Jan. 1, 2014|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110215553/http://www.adalcorcon.com/index.php/the-news/2326-comunicado-oficial-de-la-ad-alcorcon|archivedate=10 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also previously owned [[Standard Liege]] which he sold in early 2015 and [[Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint-Truidense]], which he sold in 2017.

== Career ==

In 1990, he became involved in micro-electronics. He founded several multinational corporations, of which [[Melexis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melexis.com/|title=Melexis: Semiconductor Sensor Solutions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produces [[semi-conductor]]s is the best known. Other corporations include [[X-Fab]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xfab.com/xfab/frontend/|title=X-Fab.com|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210220240/http://www.xfab.com/xfab/frontend/|archivedate=10 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also produces semi-conductors, [[Epiq]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epiq.com/dutch/about.htm|title=Epiq.com|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216012716/http://www.epiq.com/dutch/about.htm|archivedate=16 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produces electronic systems, the online-television channel [[TVLokaal.com]], and the [[holding company|holding]] [[Elex]]. He became a multimillionaire.

In 1993, he wrote a book ''NV België, verslag aan de aandeelhouders'' (''Joint stock company Belgium, a report to the shareholders''), published in early 1994. In his book, he pleaded for [[Transparency (market)|economic]] and [[Transparency (humanities)|political]] transparency. He emphasized the necessity of [[sustainable development]] in a globalized world economy. He also proposed to lower Belgium's [[public expenditure]] by 30%. A new political party [[BANAAN]] ("Beter Alternatieven Nastreven Als Apathisch Nietsdoen", or "Better seeking for alternatives than doing nothing in apathy") used this book as its political program. This party was committed to a [[basic income]] and a [[green tax shift]]. After the [[Belgian general election, 1995|1995 elections]] in which BANAAN obtained 1% of the votes, Duchâtelet founded the [[Vivant]] party/political movement which then entered in federal, regional and communal elections. In 1999, Vivant obtained 2,1% of the national votes. Duchâtelet is [[Partijvoorzitter|party chair]] and has been a candidate in several elections.

In the movie ''La vie politique des Belges'' (2002) by [[Jan Bucquoy]], Duchâtelet is depicted in Vivant's [[Belgian general election, 1999|1999 election campaign]].

In 2004 Vivant entered a [[Kartel (electoral alliance)|political alliance]] with the [[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|Flemish Liberals and Democrats]] (VLD) and Duchâtelet published his second book ''De weg naar meer netto binnenlands geluk'' (''The road to more net domestic happiness'').

In 2007 his party merged with the VLD,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gva.be/vindzoek/archief/Artikel_detail.asp?id={D5244D11-FE32-4DDC-9A86-AE7E3603B8E5}&amp;check=online GVA.be] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021028/http://www.gva.be/vindzoek/archief/Artikel_detail.asp?id=%7BD5244D11-FE32-4DDC-9A86-AE7E3603B8E5%7D&amp;check=online |date=28 September 2007 }} 11 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; which entered in the next elections as ''Open VLD''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gva.be/vindzoek/archief/Artikel_detail.asp?id={876160E0-B9CB-40B0-AB26-FE1E540F1781}&amp;check=online GVA.be] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021004/http://www.gva.be/vindzoek/archief/Artikel_detail.asp?id=%7B876160E0-B9CB-40B0-AB26-FE1E540F1781%7D&amp;check=online |date=28 September 2007 }} 11 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected as a member of the [[Belgian Senate]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Belgische Senaat |url=http://www.senate.be/www/?MIval=/index_senate&amp;MENUID=11200&amp;LANG=nl |publisher=[[Belgian Senate]] |language=Dutch |accessdate=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the main shareholder of four football clubs:

{{flagicon|ENG}} [[Charlton Athletic F.C.]] (D3), &lt;br /&gt;

==Football controversy==

In March 2016 Roland Duchatelet made headlines after a statement appeared on the [[Charlton Athletic F.C.]] website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cafc.co.uk/news/article/statement-3009419.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316130531/http://www.cafc.co.uk/news/article/statement-3009419.aspx |archivedate=16 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }} retrieved 18 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; in which some of the club's fans were accused of wanting the club to fail. In the aftermath of this statement, Charlton's newly appointed head of communications resigned from her position. The Championship side was then relegated to [[League One]] on 19 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/charlton-s-head-of-communications-quits-following-roland-duchatelet-s-car-crash-statement-a3206761.html|title=Charlton’s head of comms quits following Duchatelet’s statement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His controversial ownership has been met with widespread protests from Charlton supporters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35680770|title=Charlton Athletic fans protest against owners in England and Belgium|date=27 February 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/charlton-beach-ball-protest-angry-fans-halt-championship-match-with-brighton-a6998291.html|title=Angry fans forced this football match to be stopped when everyone started throwing beach balls|date=24 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who have formed the Coalition Against Roland Duchâtelet (CARD) and Women Against the Regime (WAR)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/CharltonCARD/&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11259">[[File:Rolex Awards for Enterprise logo.svg|thumb|Rolex - Awards for Enterprise]]
Since 1976, through the '''Rolex Awards for Enterprise''', [[Rolex]] has supported exceptional individuals who have the courage and conviction to take on major challenges; men and women who have a spirit of enterprise, initiating extraordinary projects that make the world a better place.

Created to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Rolex Oyster, the first waterproof watch and an important milestone in watchmaking, the Rolex Awards foster the values that underpin Rolex: quality, ingenuity, determination and, above all, the enterprising spirit that has driven the company since its beginning.

From the start, the Awards were designed to fill a void in corporate philanthropy by supporting exceptional individuals around the world, pioneers who had no or little access to traditional funding and were responding to major challenges with original and innovative projects that advance human knowledge and well-being.

The support given by Rolex to Award winners has had a catalytic impact and has, in many cases, transformed lives and communities. It has also stimulated new ways of thinking about common problems in areas as diverse as creating technologies that improved lives, saving endangered ecosystems, protecting the oceans, exploring new frontiers on the planet, or pioneering advances in science and health.

== Young Laureates ==

In 2010, the '''Rolex Awards''' introduced a programme for Young Laureates. Its goal was to foster innovation in the next generation by selecting five young enterprising individuals and providing them with funding and publicity for their projects.

==Recipients==

{{Japanese name|Sakonji}}
{{nihongo|'''Seizō Sakonji'''|左近司政三| Sakonji Seizō |extra=27 June 1879 – 20 August 1969}} was an admiral in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], and cabinet minister in the wartime government of the [[Empire of Japan]].

==Background==
Sakonji was born in [[Yonezawa, Yamagata|Yonezawa]], [[Yamagata Prefecture]], where his father had been a [[samurai]] in the service of the [[Yonezawa Domain]]. However, soon after his birth, the family relocated to [[Kanazawa, Ishikawa]], and then to [[Osaka]], where Sakonji was adopted by his uncle, who was a lawyer. After attending military preparatory schools, he entered the 28th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] and graduated 8th of the 105 cadets in his class in December 1900. He served his midshipman assignment on the cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Hashidate||2}}, which made  along-distance navigational training voyage to [[Manila]], [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], [[Singapore]], [[Bangkok]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Incheon]], [[Busan]] and [[Vladivostok]] in 1901. As an ensign, he was assigned to the cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Iwate||2}} as chief navigator.

He served in combat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] on [[torpedo boat]]s, becoming a torpedo warfare specialist after the war. Promoted to commander in 1915, he led the training squadron on a long distance navigational training cruise to the South Pacific, Australia and New Zealand in 1916.

During [[World War I]], he was sent to the [[Netherlands]] and the [[United Kingdom]] as a [[military attaché]] to observe modern western warfare firsthand. He was promoted to captain in 1919, and served on the Japanese delegation to the [[Treaty of Versailles]].

On his return to Japan, he was assigned to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]]. He later returned to sea in December 1923 as captain of the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}} and was promoted to rear admiral in 1924 and vice admiral in 1928. In 1929, he was an influential member of the Japanese delegation at the [[London Naval Treaty]] negotiations. On his return to Japan in 1930, he became commander of the Training Fleet, and personally led a training voyage in 1931, going from [[Keelung]] to Hong Kong, Singapore, [[Colombo]], [[Aden]], [[Port Said]], [[Naples]], [[Toulon]], [[Marseilles]], [[Malta]], [[Alexandria]], [[Djibouti]], Colombo, Batavia, Manila, [[Palau]] and Sasebo. In 1931, he became [[Ministry of the Navy of Japan|Vice-Minister of the Navy]].

In 1932, Sakonji became commander in chief of the [[3rd Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|IJN 3rd Fleet]], and of the [[Sasebo Naval District]]. Sakonji had made a very favorable impression on the [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[Combined Fleet]] [[Suzuki Kantarō]] due to his strong negotiating position during the London Naval Treaty negotiations and subsequent support for the [[Treaty Faction]] within the Imperial Japanese Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Asada. ''From Mahan to Pearl Harbor'', page 144&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, Sakonji earned the enmity of influential [[Fleet Faction]] leader, [[Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu]], and Sakonji was effectively forced into the reserves in March 1934.

Subsequently, Sakonji served as president of the [[North Sakhalin Oil Company]] from July 1935 to July 1941.
Sakonji was selected by [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Fumimaro Konoe]] to become [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (Japan)|Minister of Commerce and Industry]] in 1941. He was also granted a seat in the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]] in the [[Diet of Japan]] from January 1943. Under Prime Minister Suzuki Kantarō in April 1945, he was again appointed to the Cabinet as a [[Minister of State]], where he worked to bring about an end to the war by urging acceptance of the [[Potsdam Declaration]].
After the [[surrender of Japan]], most members of the wartime Japanese cabinets were arrested for suspected [[war crimes]] by the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|Allied occupation authorities]]. However, Sakonji was not prosecuted due to his efforts for peace at the end of the war.

Following the [[occupation of Japan]], in 1951 Sakonji was asked to serve on the committee towards the establishment of the modern [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]].

'''Scheduling Institute''' is a national private corporation headquartered in [[Alpharetta, Georgia|Alpharetta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], that focuses on teaching practice growth strategies to Doctors in various medical fields – with the majority of their client base in [[Dentistry|dental fields]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0883766D:US-scheduling-institute-inc Scheduling Institute Company Profile] Bloomburg Business. Retrieved on 5 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Scheduling Institute is the world’s largest dental training company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dentistrytoday.com/leaders2015/item/geier-jay Dentistry Today's 2015 Consulting Leaders] Dentistry Today. Retrieved on 3 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; They provide various [[training]]s, [[seminar]]s, [[Training workshop|coaching events]], and advising services to more than 2,300 practices around the world.

Jay Geier founded the Scheduling Institute in 1997 to teach practices how to properly answer their phones in order to get new patients to schedule an appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lund|first1=Benjamin|title=Corporate Profile - Scheduling Institute|url=http://www.dentaltown.com/Dentaltown/Article.aspx?aid=2251&amp;i=174&amp;st=scheduling%20institute|website=Dentaltown|publisher=Dentaltown Magazine|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has since diversified their services and now provides 26 types of in-office trainings and multiple coaching programs for their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blaes|first1=Joe|title=The Scheduling Institute Corporate Profile|url=http://www.dentaleconomics.com/articles/print/volume-104/issue-2/features/the-scheduling-institute.html|website=DentalEconomics.com|publisher=PennWell Corporation|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Jay Geier developed the Scheduling Institute concept when working as [[Vice president|Vice President]] of [[Marketing]] for a large private practice in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Geier’s marketing generated plenty of calls to the office, but the calls were not translating into new patients. He realized it did not matter how many calls his marketing generated if the people answering the phones did not know how to turn these calls into new patients. With this realization the concept behind the Scheduling Institute was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patton|first1=Kyle|title=Corporate Profile: The Scheduling Institute|journal=Orthotown Magazine|date=October 2014|url=http://www.orthotown.com/orthotown/Article.aspx?i=374&amp;aid=5116|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geier spent the next few years studying phone calls made to the practice and testing different techniques for handling these phone calls. Eventually, calls began to translate into new patients, with as many as 601 new patients booked in one week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geier|first1=Jay|title=Accidental Discovery Leads to 601 new patients in one week|url=http://www.dental-tribune.com/articles/specialities/practice_management/9791_accidental_discovery_leads_to_601_new_patients_in_one_week.html|website=Dental Tribune|publisher=Dental Tribune|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay Geier spoke at conventions while developing the Scheduling Institute’s first product: a self-study kit, coined the New Patient Generation System, that taught doctors how to leverage their most valuable asset – their staff.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.schedulinginstitute.com/sign-up/self-study-training/ Self-Study Training] schedulinginstitute.com. Retrieved on 5 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The self-study kit was first released in 1997. Even though the kit was working and doctors were increasing their new patients, Jay could see that the self-study kit alone didn’t provide enough accountability for many doctors. In 2005 the Scheduling Institute implemented its first membership program, which included telephone accountability for doctors and their staff.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.schedulinginstitute.com/who-we-are/#our-story Our Story] schedulinginstitute.com. Retrieved on 5 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, one doctor realized that he was never going to take the time to implement the [[Independent study|self-study]] kit on his own, so he asked Geier to come to his practice to implement the kit and train his team in person. After returning from the training, Geier could tell that having in-office trainings was extremely effective for a practice’s growth and [[Employee engagement|engagement]], but knew that he was not willing to personally fly all over the country to train practices. Instead, he personally selected and trained Scheduling Institute’s “Certified Training Specialists”, and began offering in-office trainings – coined “On-Site Trainings” – to clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lund|first1=Benjamin|title=On Schedule, Scheduling Institute Corporate Profile|url=http://www.dentaltown.com/Dentaltown/Article.aspx?aid=2251&amp;i=174&amp;st=scheduling%20institute|website=dentaltown.com|publisher=Farran Media|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expansion ==

=== Headquarters ===
In 2000, Scheduling Institute purchased its first headquarters in Roswell, GA, which was only 1,200 square feet. In 2005 it moved to a 2,400 square-foot suite nearby. In 2008, Scheduling Institute purchased the adjoining suite as space for an on-site Fulfillment team, adding another 2,400 square feet. By 2011 the Scheduling Institute had outgrown its Roswell headquarters, and was moved to its current location in Alpharetta, Georgia – a 37,318 square-foot building with its own in-house Fulfillment center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Brief History of the Scheduling Institute's Space &amp; Equipment|journal=The Practice|date=1 July 2014|issue=45|page=5|accessdate=|publisher=Scheduling Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atlanta Training Center ===
In 2007, the Scheduling Institute introduced its first coaching program. The coaching program included workshops, trainings, and coaching sessions. Scheduling Institute’s [[Roswell, Georgia|Roswell, GA]] location was not convenient for the majority of their members, many of whom were flying in from out of town to attend these workshops. So, in 2010 Jay Geier acquired the Scheduling Institute’s first training center in [[Downtown Atlanta]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.schedulinginstitute.com/who-we-are/#our-story About Us - the Scheduling Institute] schedulinginstitute.com. retrieved on 5 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This 8,003 square foot area occupied the second floor of a building in the [[Georgia International Convention Center]]. In 2012, Scheduling Institute expanded into the third floor of the building as well, adding 9,250 square feet to their training space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Brief History of the Scheduling Institute's Space &amp; Equipment|journal=The Practice|date=1 July 2014|issue=45|page=5|accessdate=|publisher=Scheduling Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phoenix Training Center ===
A large percentage of Scheduling Institute’s client base is located on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], and these members had to spend a significant amount of time and money to fly out to [[Atlanta, Georgia]] for workshops and events. So in 2013 Scheduling Institute decided to acquire a second training center on the west coast, and purchased a 23,000 square-foot facility in the resurgent [[Warehouse district|Warehouse District]] of [[Phoenix, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Brief History of the Scheduling Institute's Space &amp; Equipment|journal=The Practice|date=1 July 2014|issue=45|page=5|accessdate=|publisher=Scheduling Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; This location, which opened in February 2015, was chosen in order to better accommodate clients who live on the west coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scheduling Institute to move into former warehouse restaurant space|url=https://azbigmedia.com/featured/scheduling-institute-move-warehouse-restaurant-space|website=http://azbigmedia.com/|publisher=AZ Big Media|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown Phoenix Inc.’s Vice President of Economic Development praised the Scheduling Institute for the business it brings in from outside of Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Porter|first1=Brandi|title=The Resurgence of the Warehouse District in Downtown Phoenix|url=http://dtphx.org/2015/03/19/resurgence-warehouse-district-downtown-phoenix/|website=http://dtphx.org/|publisher=Downtown Phoenix Inc.|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==

=== On-Site Training ===
The Scheduling Institute now provides over 26 types of On-Site Trainings for their clients, teaching subjects such as new patient generation, [[marketing]], case acceptance, [[team building]], and [[patient experience]], among others. They have trained in all 50 states, as well as in [[Canada]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Ireland]], [[England]], [[France]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Latvia]], and others. In May of 2015, Scheduling Institute hit its 10,000th On-Site Training.

=== Hygiene Training ===
In 2011, Scheduling Institute began to offer Hygiene On-Site Trainings. These trainings are designed specifically for Hygienists, and are taught by [[Dental hygienist|Registered Dental Hygienists]] who became “Certified Training Specialists” with the Scheduling Institute. The trainings cover topics such as efficiency and streamlining, patient retention, increasing production, and [[Patient-centered care|patient-centric care]].

=== Coaching Programs ===
In 2007 the Scheduling Institute launched its first coaching program, the Platinum Coaching Program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.schedulinginstitute.com/who-we-are/#our-story Who we are- our story] schedulinginstitute.com. Retrieved on 6 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The program included workshops, an On-Site Training, 4 [[teleseminars]] with Jay Geier, coaching calls, a personal advisor, and telephone accountability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aclearfuture.com/ Coaching program features] Scheduling Institute. Retrieved on 6 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on teaching financial accountability and growing one’s [[net income]]. 
In 2011 the Scheduling Institute launched an advanced coaching program, the“5X Coaching Program”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.schedulinginstitute.com/who-we-are/#our-story Who we are- our story] schedulinginstitute.com. Retrieved on 6 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The program was created when Scheduling Institute realized that some of their clients were purchasing four On-Site Trainings, “The U”, and were attending all events on top of their Platinum Coaching Program. When many of these doctors grew their practices five times over using all of these services together, Scheduling Institute created the 5X Coaching Program. This program includes every service that the Scheduling Institute offers. It is designed to grow practices at least five times their current size over a span of ten years, with some practices growing five times in as little as three years.

=== “University” ===
In 2010, the Scheduling Institute launched “The U” – its very own “university” for a doctor’s team members. Staff members could enroll in courses that were tailored to their specific role within the practice.

=== Events ===
Scheduling Institute members attend multiple events each year hosted by Jay Geier. The events range in size and are hosted at several locations around the United States including [[Atlanta]], [[Houston]], [[San Francisco]], [[Chicago]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and [[Salt Lake City]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaygeierevents.com/ Jay Geier Events] jaygeierevents.com.

A '''specification''' often refers to a set of documented [[requirements]] to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 |title=Form and Style of Standards, ASTM Blue Book
|date=2012 |publisher=[[ASTM International]]
 |url=http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/Blue_Book.pdf
 |accessdate=5 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A specification is often a type of [[technical standard]].

There are different types of technical or engineering specifications (specs), and the term is used differently in different technical contexts. They often refer to particular documents, and/or particular information within them. The word ''specification'' is broadly defined as "to state explicitly or in detail" or "to be specific". 

Using the term "specification" without a clear indication of what kind is confusing and considered bad practice.{{who says|date=December 2017}}

A '''requirement specification''' is a documented [[requirement]], or set of documented requirements, to be satisfied by a given material, design, product, service, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 |title=Form and Style of Standards, ASTM Blue Book
|date=2012 |publisher=[[ASTM International]]
 |url=http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/Blue_Book.pdf
 |accessdate=5 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common early part of [[engineering design]] and [[product development]] processes, in many fields.

A '''functional specification''' is a kind of requirement specification, and may show functional block diagrams.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

A '''design or product specification''' describes the features of the ''solutions'' for the Requirement Specification, referring to either a designed solution '''or''' final produced solution. It is often used to guide fabrication/production. Sometimes the term ''specification'' is here used in connection with a [[data sheet]] (or ''spec sheet''), which may be confusing. A data sheet describes the technical characteristics of an item or product, often published by a manufacturer to help people choose or use the products. A data sheet is not a technical specification in the sense of informing how to produce.

An "'''in-service'''" or "'''maintained as'''" '''specification''', specifies the conditions of a system or object after years of operation, including the effects of wear and maintenance (configuration changes).

Specifications are a type of technical standard that may be developed by any of various kinds of organizations, both [[public sector|public]] and [[private sector|private]]. Example organization types include a [[corporation]], a [[consortium]] (a small group of corporations), a [[trade association]] (an industry-wide group of corporations), a national government (including its [[military]], [[regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]], and national laboratories and institutes), a [[professional association]] (society), a purpose-made [[standards organization]] such as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], or vendor-neutral developed generic requirements. It is common for one organization to ''refer to'' (''reference'', ''call out'', ''cite'') the standards of another. Voluntary standards may become mandatory if adopted by a government or business contract.

==Use==
In [[engineering]], [[manufacturing]], and [[business]], it is vital for [[suppliers]], purchasers, and users of materials, products, or services to understand and agree upon all requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 108. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A specification may refer to a [[Technical standard|standard]] which is often referenced by a [[contract]] or procurement document, or an otherwise agreed upon set of requirements (though still often used in the singular). In any case, it provides the necessary details about the specific requirements.

Standards for specifications may be provided by government agencies, standards organizations ([[ASTM]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]], [[United States Military Standard|DoD]], etc.), trade associations, corporations, and others. The following [[British standards]] apply to specifications:

*BS 7373-2:2001 Product specifications. Guide to identifying criteria for a product specification and to declaring product conformity &lt;ref&gt;[https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030018116 BS 7373-2:2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

A design/product specification does not necessarily prove a product to be correct or useful in every context. An item might be [[Verification and validation|verified]] to comply with a specification or stamped with a specification number: this does not, by itself, indicate that the item is fit for other, non-validated uses. The people who use the item (engineers, trade unions, etc.) or specify the item (building codes, government, industry, etc.) have the responsibility to consider the choice of available specifications, specify the correct one, enforce compliance, and use the item correctly. [[Verification and Validation|Validation]] of suitability is necessary.

==Construction specifications==
===Construction Specifications in North America===
Specifications in North America form part of the contract documents that accompany and govern the construction of  building and infrastructure projects. Specifications describe the quality and performance of building materials, using code citations and published standards, whereas the drawings or Building Information Model (BIM) illustrates quantity and location of materials. The guiding master document of names and numbers is the latest edition of [[MasterFormat]]. This  is a consensus document that is jointly sponsored by two professional organizations: [[Construction Specifications Canada]] and Construction Specifications Institute based in the United States and updated every two years.

While there is a tendency to believe that "Specifications overrule Drawings" in the event of discrepancies between the text document and the drawings, the actual intent must be made explicit in the contract between the Owner and the Contractor. The standard AIA (American Institute of Architects) and EJCDC (Engineering Joint Contract Documents Committee) states that  the drawings and specifications are  complementary, together providing the information required for a complete facility. Many public agencies, such as the Naval Facilities Command (NAVFAC) state that the specifications overrule the drawings. This is based on the idea that words are easier for a jury (or mediator) to interpret than drawings in case of a dispute.

The standard listing of construction specifications falls into [[50 Divisions]], or broad categories of work types and work results involved in construction. The divisions are subdivided into sections, each one addressing a specific material type (concrete) or a work product (steel door) of the construction work. A specific material may be covered in several locations, depending on the work result: stainless steel (for example) can be covered as a sheet material used in Flashing and Sheet Metal in Division 07; it can be part of a finished product, such as a handrail, covered in Division 05; or it can be a component of building hardware, covered in Division 08. The original listing of specification divisions was based on the time sequence of construction, working from exterior to interior, and this logic is still somewhat followed as new materials and systems make their way into the construction process.

Each Section is subdivided into three distinct Parts: "General", "Products" and "Execution". The MasterFormat  and Section Format &lt;ref&gt;Construction Specifications Institute&lt;/ref&gt;system can be successfully applied to residential, commercial, civil, and industrial construction. Although many Architects find the rather voluminous commercial style of specifications too lengthy for most residential projects and therefore either produce more abbreviated specifications of their own or use ArCHspec (which was specifically created for residential projects). Master specification systems are available from multiple vendors such as Arcom, Visispec, BSD, and Spectext. These systems were created to standardize language across the United States and are usually subscription based.

Specifications can be either "performance-based", whereby the specifier restricts the text to stating the performance that must be achieved by the completed work, "prescriptive" where the specifier states the specific criteria such as fabrication standards applicable to the item, or "proprietary", whereby the specifier indicates specific products, vendors and even contractors that are acceptable for each workscope. In addition, specifications can be "closed" with a specific list of products, or "open" allowing for substitutions made by the Contractor. Most construction specifications are a combination of performance-based and proprietrary types, naming acceptable manufacturers and products while also specifying certain standards and design criteria that must be met.

While North American specifications are usually restricted to broad descriptions of the work, [[Europe]]an ones and Civil work  can include actual work quantities, including such things as [[area]] of [[drywall]] to be built in square meters, like a bill of materials. This type of specification is a collaborative effort between a specwriter and a [[quantity surveyor]]. This approach is unusual in North America, where each bidder performs a quantity survey on the basis of both drawings and specifications. In many countries on the European continent, content that might be described as "specifications" in the United States are covered under the building code or municipal code.   Civil and infrastructure work in the United States often includes a quantity breakdown of the work to be performed as well. 

Although specifications are usually issued by the [[architect]]'s office, specification writing itself is undertaken by the architect and the various [[architectural engineering|engineer]]s or by specialist specification writers. Specification writing is often a distinct professional trade, with professional certifications such as "Certified Construction Specifier" (CCS)  available through the Construction Specifications Institute and the  Registered Specification Writer (RSW)&lt;ref&gt;CSC-dcc.ca/Certification&lt;/ref&gt;  through Construction Specifications Canada. Specification writers are either employees of or sub-contractors to architects, engineers, or construction management companies. Specification writers frequently meet with manufacturers of [[building materials]] who seek to have their products specified on upcoming construction projects so that contractors can include their products in the estimates leading to their proposals.

In February 2015, ArCHspec went live, from ArCH (Architects Creating Homes), a nationwide American professional society of Architects whose purpose is to improve residential architecture. ArCHspec was created specifically for use by Licensed Architects while designing SFR (Single Family Residential) architectural projects. Unlike the more commercial CSI (50+ division commercial specifications), ArCHspec utilizes the more recognizable 16 traditional Divisions, plus a Division 0 (Scope &amp; Bid Forms) and Division 17 (low voltage). Many architects, up to this point, did not provide specifications for residential designs, which is one of the reasons ArCHspec was created: to fill a void in the industry with more compact specifications for residential use. Shorter form specifications documents suitable for residential use are also available through Arcom, and follow the 50 division format, which was adopted in both the United States and Canada starting in 2004. The 16 division format is no longer considered standard, and is not supported by either CSI or CSC, or any of the subscription master specification services, data repositories, product lead systems, and the bulk of governmental agencies.

===Construction specifications in Egypt===
Specifications in [[Egypt]] form part of contract documents. The Housing and Building National Research Center ([https://web.archive.org/web/20150520220731/http://www.hbrc.edu.eg/en/Home.html HBRC]) is responsible for developing construction specifications and codes. The HBRC has published more than 15 books which cover building activities like earthworks, plastering, etc.

===Construction specifications in the UK===
Specifications in the UK are part of the contract documents that accompany and govern the construction of a building. They are prepared by construction professionals such as [[architects]], [[architectural technologists]], [[structural engineer]]s, [[landscape architect]]s and [[Building services engineering|building services engineers]]. They are created from previous project specifications, in-house documents or master specifications such as the [[National Building Specification]] (NBS). The National Building Specification is owned by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) through their commercial group RIBA Enterprises (RIBAe). NBS master specifications provide content that is broad and comprehensive, and delivered using software functionality that enables specifiers to customize the content to suit the needs of the project and to keep up to date.

UK project specification types fall into two main categories prescriptive and performance. Prescriptive specifications define the requirements using generic or proprietary descriptions of what is required, whereas performance specifications focus on the outcomes rather than the characteristics of the components.

Specifications are an integral part of [[Building Information Modeling]] and cover the non-geometric requirements.

==Food and drug specifications==
Pharmaceutical products can usually be tested and qualified by various [[Pharmacopoeia]]. Current existing pharmaceutical standards include:
* [[British Pharmacopoeia]]
* [[European Pharmacopoeia]]
* [[Japanese Pharmacopoeia]]
* [[The International Pharmacopoeia]]
* [[United States Pharmacopeia]]

If any pharmaceutical product is not covered by the above [[Technical standard|standards]], it can be evaluated by the additional source of [[Pharmacopoeia]] from other nations, from industrial specifications, or from a standardized [[formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] such as

* [[British National Formulary for Children]]
* [[British National Formulary]]
* [[National Formulary]]

A similar approach is adopted by the food manufacturing, of which [[Codex Alimentarius]] ranks the highest standards, followed by regional and national standards.&lt;ref name=anzfsc&gt;{{cite web
  | last = [[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]]

The coverage of food and drug [[Technical standard|standards]] by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] is currently less fruitful and not yet put forward as an urgent agenda due to the tight restrictions of regional or national constitution&lt;ref&gt;[[Food labeling regulations]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifications and other standards can be externally imposed as discussed above, but also internal manufacturing and quality specifications.  These exist not only for the [[food]] or [[pharmaceutical]] product but also for the processing [[machinery]], [[Quality (business)|quality]] processes, [[packaging]], [[logistics]] ([[cold chain]]), etc. and are exemplified by ''ISO 14134'' and ''ISO 15609''&lt;ref name=oois&gt;{{cite web

The converse of explicit statement of specifications is a process for dealing with observations that are out-of-specification.  The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|United States Food and Drug Administration]] has published a non-binding recommendation that addresses just this point.&lt;ref name=CDER2006&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the present time, much of the information and regulations concerning food and food products remain in a form which makes it difficult to apply automated information processing, storage and transmission methods and techniques.

Data systems that can process, store and transfer information about food and food products need formal specifications for the representations of data about food and food products in order to operate effectively and efficiently.

Development of formal specifications for food and drug data with the necessary and sufficient clarity and precision for use specifically by digital computing systems have begun to emerge from government agencies and standards organizations.

The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|United States Food and Drug Administration]] has published specifications for a "Structured Product Label" which drug manufacturers must by mandate use to submit electronically the information on a drug label.&lt;ref name=fdaspl&gt;{{cite web

Recently, [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] has made some progress in the area of food and drug [[Technical standard|standards]] and formal specifications for data about regulated substances through the publication of ''ISO 11238''&lt;ref name=iso11238&gt;{{cite web

==Information technology==

===Specification need===
In many contexts, particularly software, specifications are needed to avoid errors due to lack of compatibility, for instance, in interoperability issues.

For instance, when two applications share Unicode data, but use different normal forms or use them incorrectly, in an incompatible way or without sharing a minimum set of interoperability specification, errors and data loss can result. For example, Mac OS X has many components that prefer or require only decomposed characters (thus decomposed-only Unicode encoded with UTF-8 is also known as "UTF8-MAC"). In one specific instance, the combination of OS X errors handling composed characters, and the [[samba (software)|samba]] file- and printer-sharing software (which replaces decomposed letters with composed ones when copying file names), has led to confusing and data-destroying interoperability problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=2727174&amp;group_id=8642&amp;atid=108642 Sourceforge.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.macosxhints.com/archive/index.php/t-99344.html Forums.macosxhints.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications may avoid such errors by preserving input code points, and only normalizing them to the application's preferred normal form for internal use.

Such errors may also be avoided with algorithms normalizing both strings before any binary comparison.

However errors due to file name encoding incompatibilities have always existed, due to a lack of minimum set of common specification between software hoped to be inter-operable between various file system drivers, operating systems, network protocols, and thousands of software packages.

===Formal specification===
{{Main|Formal specification}}
A '''formal specification''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] description of [[software]] or [[computer hardware|hardware]] that may be used to develop an [[implementation]]. It describes ''what'' the system should do, not (necessarily) ''how'' the system should do it. Given such a specification, it is possible to use [[formal verification]] techniques to demonstrate that a candidate system design is correct with respect to that specification. This has the advantage that incorrect candidate system designs can be revised before a major investment has been made in actually implementing the design. An alternative approach is to use provably correct [[Program refinement|refinement]] steps to transform a specification into a design, and ultimately into an actual implementation, that is correct by construction.

===Architectural specification===
In (hardware, software, or enterprise) systems development, an '''architectural specification''' is the set of [[documentation]] that describes the [[structure]], [[behavior]], and more [[view model|views]] of that [[system]].

===Program specification===
A '''program specification''' is the definition of what a [[computer program]] is expected to do. It can be ''informal'', in which case it can be considered as a user manual from a developer point of view, or ''[[Formal specification|formal]]'', in which case it has a definite meaning defined in [[mathematics|mathematical]] or programmatic terms. In practice, many successful specifications are written to understand and fine-tune applications that were already well-developed, although [[safety-critical]] [[software systems]] are often carefully specified prior to application development. Specifications are most important for external interfaces that must remain stable.

===Functional specification===
{{Main|Functional specification}}
In [[software development]], a '''functional specification''' (also, '''functional spec''' or '''specs''' or '''functional specifications document (FSD)''') is the set of [[documentation]] that describes the behavior of a computer program or larger [[software system]]. The documentation typically describes various inputs that can be provided to the [[software]] system and how the [[system]] responds to those inputs.

===Web service specification===

'''Tanduay''' is a brand of [[rum]] produced in the [[Philippines]] by Tanduay Distillers, Inc., a diversified [[beverage]] company owned by [[LT Group, Inc.]]. 

==History==
Tanduay traces its origins to a distillery in [[Hagonoy, Bulacan]] originally owned by Elías Menchatorre. In 1856, the distillery was acquired by Valentin Teus y Yrisarry and brought into [[Ynchausti y Compañia|Ynchausti y Compañía]], a partnership owned by José Joaquin de Ynchausti, Joaquín Marcelino Elizalde y Yrisarry, and Juan Bautista y Yrisarry. Although the Hagonoy distillery was already in operation at the time of the acquisition, Ynchausti y Compañia decided to use its own foundation date (1854) as the distillery’s foundation date. Six years later, a rectifying plant was constructed in Isla de Tanduay, bordering the [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]] and [[San Miguel, Manila|San Miguel]] districts of [[Manila]], becoming the original Tanduay distillery. 

There are no records of the product names produced by these two distilleries and it can be assumed that all alcoholic products of the period were sold without brand names or distinctive labels and were referred to by their generic names: "''aguardiente''" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for [[wikt:firewater|firewater]]), "''tubâ''" ([[palm wine]]) and "''ron''" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for [[rum]]). However, earliest records of the distillery list its rum simply as "''ron de destillería de Hagonoy y Tanduay''" (literally, “rum from the distillery of Hagonoy and Tanduay”). 

By the 1900s, production would shift to the Manila distillery. By the 1930s, the rum it produced became branded as '''Tanduay Rhum''' and its packaging was changed from the 10 gallon ''[[dama juana]]'' container to the smaller (375 ml, 750 ml) glass bottles.&lt;ref&gt; http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20060809-14195/Tanduay&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/arts-and-culture/279715/writers-and-rum|title=Writers and rum|first=Alfred A.|last=Yuson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tanduay Distillery, Inc.===
In 1934/1935, Elizalde &amp; Company, Inc. - a new company established by the grandchildren of Joaquín Marcelino Elizalde y Yrisarry (one of the original minority partners of Ynchausti y Compañia) - acquired the major business assets of Ynchausti &amp; Company, including the Tanduay distillery. Under the ownership of the Elizalde group, the distillery operated under the corporate name Tanduay Distillery, Inc. and became a successful enterprise, producing quality rum and other distilled spirits for both domestic and international markets.

===Tanduay Distillers, Inc.===
On May 18, 1988, Twin Ace Holdings Corporation, a company owned by [[Lucio Tan]], acquired the Tanduay brand and related assets of Tanduay Distillery, Inc. from Elizalde &amp; Company, Inc. The new management launched a plant modernization and expansion program that increased the distillery's production capacity by almost 50 times. On July 30, 1999 Twin Ace Holdings changed its corporate name to Tanduay Distillers, Inc. Aside from rum, Tanduay Distillers, Inc. also produces [[gin]], [[vodka]], [[brandy]], and [[whiskey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanduay.com/corp/who_we_are/history|title=Age Verification - Tanduay Distillers, Inc.|website=Tanduay Distillers, Inc.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322013411/http://www.tanduay.com/corp/who_we_are/history|archivedate=2014-03-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Asian Alcohol Corporation
* Absolut Distillers, Inc. (formerly, Absolut Chemicals, Inc.)

====LT Group, Inc.====
On July 8, 1999, Asian Pacific Equity Corporation ({{Pse|APEC}}), a company also owned and controlled by [[Lucio Tan]], acquired 100% ownership of Twin Ace Holdings Corporation via a share swap with Twin Ace's existing shareholders. On November 10, 1999, APEC changed its corporate name to Tanduay Holdings, Inc. ({{Pse|TDY}}) and increased authorized capital from 1 billion pesos to 5 billion pesos at a par value of 1.00 peso per share. On October 2012, Tanduay Holdings, Inc. was renamed [[LT Group, Inc.]] ({{Pse|LTG}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.inquirer.net/85306/sec-approves-tanduay-holdings-shift-into-lt-group-inc|title=SEC approves Tanduay Holdings’ shift into LT Group Inc.|first=Doris C.|last=Dumlao|website=business.inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritage==

===Coat of arms===
The Tanduay [[coat of arms]] has appeared in the label of Tanduay branded products since the time of Tanduay Distillery, Inc. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} (predecessor of the current company, Tanduay Distillers, Inc.). It features two [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]s (shields). The left shield is based on the escutcheon of the Ynchausti [[family crest]], the original owners of the Tanduay distillery.

===The original Tanduay distillery===

The original Tanduay distillery located at Calle Tanduay (now, J. Nepomuceno Street) in [[Quiapo, Manila]] has been Tanduay’s prime production facility until it was decommissioned on April 2013. Tanduay Distillers, Inc. announced that production will be relocated to a larger facility located in [[Cabuyao]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], capable of producing 100,000 cases a day. The original distillery’s production capacity was at 30,000 cases a day. Portions of the original distillery will be converted into a museum to showcase the history and heritage of Tanduay. The distillery may be reopened in the future, if needed, to serve as backup production facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.inquirer.net/115319/lucio-tan-closes-old-tanduay-distillery-in-quiapo|title=Lucio Tan closes old Tanduay distillery in Quiapo|first=Doris C.|last=Dumlao|website=business.inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The original Tanduay distillery adopted its name from its original location on ''Isla de Tanduay'', a triangular area of Manila bounded by the ''esteros'' ([[estuary|estuaries]]) of San Miguel and San Sebastian. "Tanduay" comes from the word "''tangwáy''", the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] term for "peninsula" that also meant "low-lying land". This was because the entire area, including nearby [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], was frequently flooded during the rainy season. In [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], "''tanguay''" meant a place where ''tubâ'' ([[palm wine]]) is bought and sold.

==NBA sponsorship==

In March 2017, Tanduay became the first Philippine brand to have a major sponsorship deal with an [[NBA]] team and arena. The partnership will designate Tanduay as the official rum of [[Barclays Center]] and the [[Brooklyn Nets]], as well as the presenting sponsor of the venue’s [[40/40 Club]] &amp; Restaurant for the remainder of the [[2016–17 NBA season]]. Additionally, Tanduay Rhum will be an associate sponsor of the arena’s Brooklyn Show platform and will have a variety of signage integrated throughout the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/nets/news/2017/03/07/tanduay-rum-signs-first-nba-arena-partnership-with-barclays-center-and-the-brooklyn-nets|title=TANDUAY RUM SIGNS FIRST NBA ARENA PARTNERSHIP WITH BARCLAYS CENTER AND THE BROOKLYN NETS - Brooklyn Nets|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.ph/basketball/news/brooklyn-nets-barclays-center-partnership-tanduay-rum|title=Tanduay breaks new ground as first PH company to tie up with NBA team, arena - SPIN.PH|first=|last=|date=8 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Tanduay signed a two-year partnership with the [[Golden State Warriors]], designating Tanduay as the presenting sponsor of various games of the Warriors including the Warriors' Filipino Heritage Night on October 29, 2017. The partnership will run from the [[2017–18 NBA season]] until the end of the [[2018–19 NBA season]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22799">'''Teleadministration''' is based on the concept that documents in electronic format have legal value. Administrative informatics is not new, but for many years it was merely Information Technology applied to legal documents, that is, the reproduction of paper-based legal documents into electronic file systems. Instead, Teleadministration turns this approach into its head. It is based on research conducted in 1978, the year when, at a conference promoted by the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]], [[:it:Giovanni Duni|Giovanni Duni]] launched the then-futuristic idea that an electronic document could have legal value.&lt;ref&gt;1.

This research referred to the asymmetric encryption technology (Diffie and Hellman, New directions in Cryptography, in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, November 1976, 644 ss. Diffie and Hellman’s research was disseminated in Italy by  Gardner, “Un nuovo tipo di cifrario che richiederebbe milioni di anni per essere decifrato”, in Le Scienze, December 1977, 126 ss.), who added the regulation for issuing the keys and the public certification process associated to them.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in the United States, yet it would take more than twenty-five years for jurists and mathematicians to start working together.&lt;ref&gt;3. The first application of the research by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman was the 1995 Utah Code, § from 46-3-101 to 46-3-504 (Enacted by l. 1995, ch. 61). The Utah code was analysed in the brilliant dissertation written by Francesca Flora, Evoluzione della informatica nel sistema di governo degli Stati Uniti d’America (Cagliari, dept. Of Politiacl Science, November 1996). For application at the federal level one had to wait until 1998: US Senate, S. 1594, Digital Signature and Electronic Authentication Law (SEAL) of 1998. — US House of Representatives, H.R. 3472, Digital Signature and Electronic Authentication Law (SEAL) of 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, and even before 1978, IT helped [[Public Administration]] but kept a “safe distance”, assuming that the ‘sacred nature’ of the Law demanded the use of pen and paper. Information Technology merely managed and filed copies of legal documents: it was known as “parallel IT”,&lt;ref&gt;4. Duni, G., Amministrazione digitale, Voce della Enciclopedia del diritto, Annali, I, Milano 2007, p. 13-49.&lt;/ref&gt; since it was an accessory to the activity with formal value, the one based on pen and paper.

Thus, the logical, legal and material premise of Teleadministration is the conferment of legal value to IT documents.

== Origins and terminology  ==
In Italy, the linguistic expression &lt;ref&gt;5. [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/teleamministrazione_(Lessico-del-XXI-Secolo) Teleamministrazione, Lessico del XXI secolo], Treccani&lt;/ref&gt; teleamministrazione was first used in 1991 at the Roman ‘La Sapienza’ university, during a conference organised by the Court of Cassation,&lt;ref&gt;6. Duni, G., Il progetto nazionale di teleamministrazione pubblica, in “L’informatica giuridica e il Ced della Corte di Cassazione”, proceedings of the conference held at the Univ. of Rome “La Sapienza”, 27-29 Nov. 1991, Milan 1992, p. 87 ss.&lt;/ref&gt; in which it was said that: «the new system of administrative information technology is called “teleadministration” because all the work of the [[Public Administration]] will be carried out through devices, that could also be computers, linked to the central server through a network.» Teleadministration was indeed considered a type of teleworking.&lt;ref&gt;7. Applicazioni della multimedialità nella P.A.: teleamministrazione e telelavoro”, in Funzione Pubblica, special issue “I convegni di FORUM P.A. ’96”, volume I, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Teleadministration, amministrative procedures become electronic administrative procedures and, more specifically, those that are initiated by a party realize the electronic One Stop Shop.

== The fundamentals of teleadministration ==
In the decades from 1970 to 1990, the [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]] was at the core of research on the relationship between IT and Law, organising international conferences every five years on the topic. The 1993 international conference featured the fundamentals of teleadministration, providing the details of the administrative systems behind the One Stop Shop concept:&lt;ref&gt;8. Duni, G., presentation at the 5th International Congress at the Court of Cassation on “IT and Legal Activity” Rome, 3–7 May 1993, I.P.Z.S. - Libreria dello Stato, 1994, II, p. 381 ss.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A citizen presents his/her claim to one administration, which then manages the entire procedure.
# A single “administrative file” is created, no matter how many different administrations may be involved.
# For both internal and external stages in an administrative procedure, a "warning signal" is sent telematically to the relevant office where the next stage is due, the employee in that office then becomes responsible for that phase of the procedure.
# Any information concerning records already held by public administration is accessed telematically, without involving the citizen. 
# The (electronic) signature identifies the identity of the operator through sophisticated techniques.
# The original of an administrative act is electronic and is therefore always available telematically to any administration that may need it. 
# The presence of an increasing amount of on-line data will necessitate greater use of automatic data processing in decision-making.
# Saving data on multiple memory locations will guarantee the safekeeping of the acts. 
# Statistical data will be available in real time and under multiple profiles, with great benefits for top level decision-making.
# Private citizens can obtain paper copies of the electronic acts.
It should be noted that the 5th fundamental mentions electronic rather than digital signatures.  This is because, in the jurists’ domain, digital signatures were not yet known. The generic reference to the electronic signature is however valid, and its general nature is actually suitable for the rules contained six years later in the Directive 1999/93/EC.
As we will see, the Directive refers in particular to all procedures initiated by private citizens, but the system remains valid for all procedures initiated by the administration offices as well.

== Acknowledgement of the principles in current law ==
The legally accepted form of acts and documents evolved according to the following stages:
# Acts only exist in paper form
# Acts in electronic format are a possible option
# Electronic format is compulsory, safe for a few exceptions
In Italy, Phase 2 was launched by Art 15, para, 2,  Law N. 59 of 15 March 1997, (the so-called ‘Bassanini 1’ law: it established the legal value of electronic documents, while regulations would establish the authentication criteria). The EC intervened later with its Directive 1999/93/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] of 13 December 1999 (Transposed by Law Decree N.10 of 23 January 2002), which imposes an obligation on Member States to give legal value to documents with digital signatures (not directly named as such, but all their features are described in the directive). It also establishes that electronic documents should not be rejected a priori, hence opening to a range of different solutions to establish the authorship of a document (the so-called ‘weak signatures’).

The 1993 Directive was revoked and absorbed (for reasons of legal certainty and clarity) by Regulation 910/2014 of the European Parliament and Council of 23 July 2014 (also known as eIDAS regulation) in the OJEU 28 August 2014, which did not renege on the principle of also accepting the so-called ‘weak signatures’.
In Italy, The move to Phase 3 was established by Art.40 of Legislative sl. Decree N.82 of 7 March 2007, Code of Digital Administration (CAD), entitled “Creation of electronic documents”, which states: “Public Administrations make the original copy of their documents with electronic means, according to the provisions of the present Code and the technical specifications of Article 71”. Exceptions are extremely rare: Comma 3 states: by means of appropriate regulations…. , proposed by the delegated Ministers for Public Functions, Innovation and Technology and the Minister for Cultural Heritage and Activities, the categories of administrative documents that can be created on paper in original are identified, having regard to the special historical and archive value they will have by nature” (think, for example, of the resignation of a President of the Republic).

Unfortunately, national administrations are ignoring this provision, and today it is only private companies that are no longer allowed paper-based communication with public administrations (Art. N. 5 bis of the CAD and D.P.C.M. 22 July 2011); compulsory electronic invoicing was added on 31 March 2015 by Law N. 44 of 24 December 2007, Art. N. 1, para 209-214 implemented by Ministerial  Decree N.55 of 3 April 2013, further clarified by Ministerial circular N.1 of 9 March 2015.
The modernisation of procedures was also touched by Presidential Decree N. 447 of 20 October 1998 (creation of the One Stop Shop, but only for production activities, and paper based), while interest for a telematic procedure only began with Legislative Decree N. 82 of 7 March 2005, CAD, which is not as relevant in its first version but was later modified by several interventions, particularly Legislative Decree N. 335 of 10 December 2013.

European sources are also essential. The EC, and later the European Union, have undertaken a wide range of actions on e-government: one of the most important was the launch of the IDABC programme (and financing) for Interoperable Delivery of European eGovernment Services to public Administrations, Business and Citizens, via Decision 2004/387/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 21 April 2004. However, the ultimate acknowledgement of the principles of teleadministration, with the telematic One Stop Shop, is contained in the Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 12 December 2006, on the Internal market for services, which provides for Member States to set up an electronic One Stop Shop in the wide field of administrative procedures.

== Teleadministration and the ‘star’ procedure ==
This article is not meant to argue the great effect that teleadministration has on the efficiency of administrative activity, as we assume that the reader is fully aware that, once paper based documents are abandoned, the real-time flow of documents greatly improves time management and responsibility of the single offices/ operators, while direct online access improves transparency. Rather, this paragraph wants to emphasize how teleadministration promotes maximum usage of the “star procedure”, known and researched in Germany as “Sternverfahren”. This procedure, an alternative to the sequential procedure, which has by nature longer head times, in the paper-based world would require making several copies of the administrative file (which can be extremely voluminous) for each office and each administration that needs to express an opinion or issue an authorisation. With the One Stop Shop, the administration initiating the process is charged with this task. Electronic files clearly provide evident benefits for these procedures, since all involved administrations can directly and simultaneously access the file, view the part they need to evaluate and add their opinion or authorisation directly, using a star-shaped scheme.

== Assessing the actual acceptance of teleadministration in current law and real life ==
As a scientific proposition, teleadministration sketched the system of telematic administrative procedures well ahead of the law, and particularly the electronic One Stop Shop concept. Both concepts are based on the dematerialisation of documents and on telematic administrative work.

The concept of documents’ dematerialisation,&lt;ref&gt;9. According to some commentators “dematerialization” is not the appropriate term for documents that are created in electronic form, but rather for those that are created in paper form and are later converted in digital format. Though conceptually correct, this observation ignores the fact that the expression now is generally understood to mean any “form that does without the material presence of paper, from the creation of the document”&lt;/ref&gt; in existence since 1978 as a scientific notion,&lt;ref&gt;10. See note. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; was first embraced in Italy (Law N. 59 of 15 March 1997, Art. 15, para 2) and later by the E.C. in Directive 1999/93/EC.

Once the principle that an electronic document can have legal value was accepted, it was possible to deal with its management within a telematic procedure.
As mentioned, configuring this procedure within the rules of teleadministration is today accepted in both European and Italian laws. European laws also provide quite a detailed description of the electronic One Stop Shop, with rules that fit nicely within the scientific rules of teleadministration; their main limitation is that they were specifically designed for the free circulation of services within Europe, and hence for the procedures these require. It is the above-mentioned 1996/123/EC Directive, whose Art.6 establishes the One Stop Shop and Art. 8 provides that it should be managed “remotely and electronically”, leaving further details to the Commission. And indeed the Commission, with its Decision of 16 October 2009, provided a number of measures to facilitate the use of electronic procedures through the “One Stop Shop” under Directive 2006/123/EC. These sources are clear and they apply to a wide-ranging sector: the problem is that any sector or procedure that is not related to the supply of services within the Union is not regulated, and Member States are therefore able to carry on with old-fashioned paper-based procedures.

In light of this limitation, a group of illustrious European Law academics, coordinated by Giovanni Duni, has drafted the most effective text for a Directive providing a universal system of telematic administrative procedure.&lt;ref&gt;11. The outcome of this collective research effort is the text for a draft Directive, that can be found on the CNR ITTIG journal  Informatica e diritto, Vol. XXI, 2012, N. 2, pp. 113-129: The telematic procedures in the European Union. Introducing a draft Directive, as well as  on line, with an Italian and an English language version of the draft on the site [http://www.teleamministrazione.it www.teleamministrazione.it]&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian sources are based on the Code of Digital Administration, the above-mentioned Law Decree N.82 of 7 March 2005 in its current version, following several modifications, which (if correctly interpreted and implemented) should make it compulsory for all public administrations to use teleadministration, thus making the telematic administrative procedure the default procedural method. Art. 14, the key provision, establishes that the proceeding administration creates an electronic file, to which all involved administrations can and should have access, and feed it with the acts of their competence. Private citizens can also access it under Law 241/90
Thus the electronic file is the technical and organizational specification of the telematic administrative procedure, as it is clear that its creation is an operative stage of the procedure and not simply a new filing system for the archives.

Art. 10 of the CAD appears at first to be at odds with this interpretation, since it establishes that the One Stop Shop for productive activities provides its services electronically but leaves doubts about the possibility that the back office activities could be still paper-based. However, if Art. 10 and Art. 41 are interpreted together, the only possible conclusion is that the former is a clarification of front office activities, but all the administrative activity is based on the general rule of electronic files, and therefore on the teleadministration and the One Stop Shop. 
Compared to European and Italian law, reality is somewhat behind. Eight years after Directive 1996/123/CE, there would be grounds for an infraction procedure against Italy. But since Italy enjoys the company of several other non-compliant Member States, they are all ‘safe’ for the time being.

Though the letter of the CAD may be not be respected, it seems very unlikely that this may determine the invalidity or nullity of the acts for violation of Art. 41(electronic file) or Art. 40 (statutory requirement of digital signature), because in front of a claim of this nature, the administrative judge would apply Artt. 21 septies and 21 octies of Law 241/90. The claimant should demonstrate that the use of the electronic format and electronic file would have led to a different outcome.

'''Theodor "Teto" Ahrenberg''' (2 March 1912 – 21 June 1989) was a Swedish businessman and collector.&lt;ref name="Corbusier Jenger 2002 p. 470"&gt;{{cite book | last=Corbusier | first=L. | last2=Jenger | first2=J. | title=Le Corbusier: choix de lettres | publisher=Birkhäuser – Editions d'Architecture | series=Éditions d'architecture | year=2002 | isbn=978-3-7643-6455-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOKNzunERUwC&amp;pg=PA470 | language=fr | access-date=6 October 2018 | page=470}}&lt;/ref&gt; His extensive collection featured works by artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Le Corbusier]], Olle Bærtling, [[Sam Francis]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[Christo]], [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Tadeusz Kantor]], [[Enrico Baj]], [[Jean Tinguely]] and [[Niki de Saint Phalle]]. Key works in the collection included the two versions of Matisse's ''Apollo'' (1953), Picasso's ''Nude in a rocking chair'' (1956) and Chagall's ''Les mariés sous le baldaquin'' (1949).

== Life ==
=== Early life and career ===
Theodor Ahrenberg, son of Swedish shipping magnate and owner of Th. Ahrenberg Rederi (Th. Ahrenberg Shipping Co.) Ossian Ahrenberg and his wife Naëma Ahrenberg (born Wijkander), spent his youth in Gothenburg, centred at the family home at Viktor Rydbergsgatan 14. Following moderate academic performance at school, Ahrenberg was withdrawn from Högre Samskola by his father, and began working in shipping in Stettin, Hamburg and Newcastle. Ahrenberg later described this training as important preparation for his career as a collector: “You had to be far-sighted, careful and daring, all at the same time ... and you simply had to succeed. That was the charm of shipping, and in my case, it could be said that such speculative tendencies and audacity ... left their mark on me, even in the new world into which I would enter, that of art.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Ahrenberg, ''Jag har ju ändå en Picasso.Memoarer av Teto Ahrenberg, utmanaren, konstsamlaren, mecenaten'', Ulla Ahrenberg and Folke Edwards (eds.), Walhström &amp; Widstrand,Stockholm, 1993, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939–40 Ahrenberg fought as a volunteer in the Swedish forces against Finland in the Winter War against Russia, and was highly decorated.

Returning to Gothenburg in 1941 and following the decline of Th. Ahrenberg Shipping Co., Ahrenberg moved to Stockholm to further his career. He first worked inventorying barrels for Nynäs Petroleum, then moved to a more senior position at the Trade and Industry Commission, before finally commencing an executive managerial role at the Gas and Coke Economic Federation (GOKEF).

=== Collecting beginnings ===
On business trips throughout Europe for GOKEF beginning in the late 1940s, Ahrenberg discovered his passion for modern art and began collecting, with an initial focus on graphic prints including those of Picasso. In time he amassed one of the most important and qualitative private European collections of twentieth-century Western art.

From the early 1950s Agnes Widlund (1910–2005), founder and director of Gallery Samlaren at Birger Jarlsgatan 1 in Stockholm, began advising Ahrenberg on his collection. Under Widlund's guidance the collection expanded to include works by Matisse, Chagall, Le Corbusier, [[Georges Braque]] and [[Georges Rouault]]. Widlund arranged visits by Ahrenberg to artists in their studios including Picasso, Matisse, Chagall and Le Corbusier, beginning Ahrenberg's lifelong passion for meeting the artists whose work he collected and purchasing from them directly.

=== Relationship with Swedish art establishment ===
Ahrenberg became a central figure in Swedish and European art circles, and held positions including secretary of the Tessin Society and was a board member of art associations including Friends of [[Nationalmuseum]], Friends of [[Moderna Museet]], and Aspect. He dedicated himself to improving conditions for art students and young artists, culminating in his controversial speech “The Poverty of Art in the Welfare State” made at Aspect's public meeting at Stockholm's Academy of Fine Arts on 3 September 1959. In it he called for more state support for artists and art institutions, and criticized then director of Stockholm's Nationalmuseum Carl Nordenfalk (1907–92) for his apprehensive approach to funding. Ahrenberg thus conflicted with Sweden's conservative art institutions, particularly in areas of finance.

=== Ahrenberg Museum by Le Corbusier ===
Such disputes, above all with Nordenfalk who rejected Ahrenberg's proposals of December 1959 that the collection be deposited at Nationalmuseum or another Swedish institution, led Ahrenberg to the decision to build his own exhibition space in Stockholm, known as the Palais Ahrenberg or Ahrenberg Museum. In 1961 Le Corbusier, with whom Ahrenberg was on close terms, agreed to design the museum; the plans were presented publicly in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Fondation Le Corbusier: [http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/corbuweb/morpheus.aspx?sysId=13&amp;IrisObjectId=7287&amp;sysLanguage=en-en&amp;itemPos=142&amp;itemSort=en-en_sort_string1%20&amp;itemCount=215&amp;sysParentName=&amp;sysParentId= Pavillon d'exposition, palais Ahrenberg, Stockholm, Sweden, 1962], accessed on 6 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Le Corbusier took his inspiration from a design which he had made two years previously for a similar project in Tokyo and which was ultimately executed in 1964 for the Heidi Weber Museum in Zurich, also known as the “Centre Le Corbusier”. A model of the Ahrenberg Museum, based on Le Corbusier's original plans, has been housed there since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;The model (1.50 x 1.80 m / 1:20) was made at RWTH Aachen University under the supervision of Professor Rudolf Bertig.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loss of collection and relocation to Switzerland ===
The Ahrenberg Museum was, however, never built, as the Swedish state prosecuted Ahrenberg, controversially confiscated the collection, and sold it in an enforced series of auctions beginning in 1963. Ahrenberg and his wife Ulla (born Ulla Frisell in 1931) and their four children subsequently settled at the house Le Rocher in Chexbres, Switzerland, above the north bank of Lake Geneva, where he began to rebuild the collection. Specifically he established an atelier at Le Rocher where he invited a series of artists of the post-war European avant-garde to live and work, often for several months at a time. Ahrenberg died on 21 June 1989 at the age of 77 in Vevey.

== The first collection ==
Ahrenberg's first collection was at the time one of the most extensive private collections of twentieth-century Western art, comprising around 1,000 works that presented a cross-section of modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Tilo Richter: ''[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunstmarkt/auktionen/theodor-ahrenberg-im-portraet-dabei-sein-in-der-kueche-der-kunst-1621317-p2.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2 Dabei sein in der Küche der Kunst – Theodor Ahrenberg im Porträt]'' in the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung#Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (FAS)|FAS]] from 21 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahrenberg acquired works by both famous and relatively renowned artists including Henri Matisse (1869–1954), Pablo Picasso (1881–1973), Georges Braque (1882–1963), Marc Chagall (1887–1985), Le Corbusier (1887–1965), [[Fernand Léger]], (1881–1955), [[Alberto Giacometti]], (1901–66), [[Henry Moore]] (1898–1986), Mark Tobey (1890–1976), among other, non-established figures. According to Ulla Ahrenberg the collection at its height featured alone hundreds of works by Picasso and nearly all of Matisse's sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;Tilo Richter: ''[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunstmarkt/auktionen/theodor-ahrenberg-im-portraet-dabei-sein-in-der-kueche-der-kunst-1621317-p2.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2 Dabei sein in der Küche der Kunst – Theodor Ahrenberg im Porträt]'' in the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung#Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (FAS)|FAS]] from 21 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Büscher]]: ''[http://www.blau-magazin.de/ Dann nahmen sie Teto mit – Wie Picassos Freund seine weltberühmte Sammlung verlor]'' in ''Blau'' (Kunstmagazin der [[Die Welt|Welt]]), pp. 48–55, May/June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahrenberg also passionately supported his sometimes controversial fellow Swedish artists, including Carl Kylberg, Olle Bærtling, Einar Hylander, [[Öyvind Fahlström]], [[Richard Mortensen]], [[Robert Jacobsen]] and [[Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd]]. Another focus was artists from Eastern Europe whose practice was then limited by restrictive state policies behind the Iron Curtain, in particular [[Tadeusz Kantor]] (1915–90). Ahrenberg's outspoken support for such artists at this time only increased the tension between himself and the conservative art establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Carin Ståhlberg: ''[http://www.dn.se/arkiv/kultur/fel-man-pa-fel-plats-vid-fel-tid-theodor-ahrenberg Fel man på fel plats vid fel tid]'' (''Wrong Man at the Wrong Place at the Wrong Time '') in [[Dagens Nyheter]], 19 June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of the collection today has been estimated at over a billion Euros.

== The second collection ==
Ahrenberg's second collection comprised mainly works by artists who were guests at the Le Rocher atelier. These were primarily friends and included Sam Francis, Christo, Lucio Fontana, Jean Tinguely, Niki de Saint Phalle, Arman, [[Robert Rauschenberg]], Mark Tobey, Enrico Baj, [[Yaacov Agam]] and Heinrich Richter. The character of the second collection stands in stark contrast to that of the first, which had provided an overview of modernism through Ahrenberg's choices. In art critic Folke Edward's words the new collection “showed a playful, experimental and personal character; it is a subjective and spontaneous, not shaped by a desire to present an objective or qualitative overview.” In time Ahrenberg's second collection grew to encompass around 6,000 objects, among them curiosities and experimental works such as the ceramics (including plates, bowls, piggy banks and ashtrays) and wine labels – all idiosyncratically and often whimsically decorated by artists visiting Le Rocher, including Albert Chubac, Lars Gynning, Gérard “Imof” Imhof, Julio Zapata, Roberto Crippa and Ricci Riggenbach.

After Theodor Ahrenberg's death in 1989, Ulla Ahrenberg has continued her role as custodian and archivist of the collection. Their son [[Staffan Ahrenberg]], a successful Hollywood producer and entrepreneur, continues his father's collecting tradition; his own collection includes contemporary American and European art, such as that of [[Richard Serra]], [[Robert Longo]], [[Wolfgang Tillmans]], [[Cildo Meireles]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Martin Kippenberger]] and [[Adrián Villar Rojas]]. In October 2012 Staffan Ahrenberg relaunched the renowned French art and literature journal [[Cahiers d'art]].

In September 2018 the first comprehensive monograph of Theodor Ahrenberg's life and collections was published in English as ''Living with Picasso, Matisse and Christo: Theodor Ahrenberg and His Collections'' by Thames &amp; Hudson, London; and in Swedish as ''Ett liv med Matisse, Picasso och Christo – Theodor Ahrenberg och hans samlingar'' by Arvinius + Orfeus Publishing, Stockholm.

'''Timothy Eaton''' (March 1834 – 31 January 1907) was an Irish businessman who founded the [[Eaton's]] [[department store]], one of the most important retail businesses in Canada's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/timothy-eaton | title=Timothy Eaton | author = Joy L. Santink | publisher= [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] | accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
He was born in [[Ballymena]], County Antrim, [[History of Ireland (1801–1923)|Ireland]] (now [[Northern Ireland]]). His parents were Scottish Protestants, John Eaton and Margaret Craig. As a 20-year-old Irish apprentice shopkeeper, Timothy Eaton sailed from Ireland to settle with other family members in southern [[Ontario]], Canada. On 28 May 1862, Eaton married Margaret Wilson Beattie. They had five sons and three daughters. Among the sons were [[John Craig Eaton]] and Edward Young Eaton. One of the daughters, Josephine Smyth Eaton, survived the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania]]'' off the Irish coast in 1915. His granddaughter, Iris Burnside, was lost in that sinking.

==T. Eaton Co. Limited==
[[File:Eaton1.jpg|left|thumb|Plaque about Eaton in Toronto]]
[[File:TimothyeatonstatueCommons.jpg|thumb|This bronze [[Timothy Eaton statue|statue of Eaton]] (photographed in 1919) sits in the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] in Toronto; its replica sits in the [[MTS Centre]] in Winnipeg]]
In 1854, he worked for a short time in a haberdashery store in [[Glen Williams, Ontario]]. His sister married William Reid; they owned a farm in [[Georgetown, Ontario]], a short distance from Glen Williams. In 1865, with the help of his brothers, Robert and James, Timothy Eaton set up a bakery business in the town of [[Kirkton, Ontario]], which went under after only a few months. Undaunted, he opened a dry goods store in [[St. Marys, Ontario]]. 

In 1869, Eaton purchased an existing dry-goods and haberdashery business at 178 [[Yonge Street]] in Toronto. In promoting his new business, Eaton embraced two retail practices that were ground-breaking at the time:{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} first, all goods had one price (no haggling) with no credit given, and second, all purchases came with a money-back guarantee (a practice expressed in what would become the long-standing store slogan of "Goods Satisfactory or Money Refunded").

Starting in 1884, Eaton introduced Canada to the wonders of the [[mail-order catalogue]], reaching thousands of small towns and rural communities with an array of products previously unattainable. In these tiny communities, the arrival of Eaton's catalogue was a major event. More than clothing, furniture, or the latest in kitchen gadgetry, the catalogue offered such practical items as milking machines, in addition to just about every other contraption or new invention desirable. And, when rendered obsolete by the new season's catalogue, it served another important use in the outdoor privy of most every rural home.

Eaton spawned a colossal retail empire that his offspring would expand coast to coast, reaching its high point during [[World War II]], when the [[Eaton's|T. Eaton Co. Limited]] employed more than 70,000 people.  Although Eaton did not invent the department store, nor was he the first retailer in the world to implement a money-back guarantee, the chain he founded popularized both concepts and revolutionized retailing in Canada.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Eaton Family Mausoleum.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The [[Eaton family]]'s mausoleum in [[Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto|Mount Pleasant Cemetery]], Toronto]]
Eaton died of pneumonia on 31 January 1907, and is buried in [[Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto|Mount Pleasant Cemetery]] in Toronto. He was succeeded by his son, [[John Craig Eaton]].

In 1919, [[Timothy Eaton statue|two life-sized statues of Timothy Eaton]] were donated by the Eaton's employees to the Toronto and Winnipeg stores in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the company. For years, it was tradition for customers in both Toronto and Winnipeg to rub the toe of the statue for good luck. The Toronto statue is now housed by the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], and the Winnipeg statue sits in the city's new arena, [[Bell MTS Place]] (formerly the [[MTS Centre]]), in almost exactly the same spot where it stood in the now demolished Eaton's store (albeit one storey higher). Museum-goers in Toronto and hockey fans in Winnipeg continue to rub Timothy Eaton's toe for luck.

His grandson was flying ace [[Henry John Burden]]. In 1985, his great-great granddaughter, [[Nancy Eaton]], was murdered by a childhood friend, who was found not guilty by [[insanity defense|reason of insanity]].

[[Timothy Eaton Memorial Church]], in Toronto, was erected in 1914.

The town of [[Eatonia, Saskatchewan]] was named after Timothy Eaton.

The ground of [[Ballymena RFC]], originally the sports grounds of the Mid-Antrim Sports Association, is called Eaton Park.

A school in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], Ontario, [[Timothy Eaton Business and Technical Institute]], was named after him. It opened in 1971 for classes and closed its doors permanently in 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3314">'''Wertheimer et Frère''' is a [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing]] and [[horse breeding|breeding]] business partnership between brothers [[Alain Wertheimer|Alain]] and [[Gérard Wertheimer]] of France.

The Wertheimer brothers are the owners of the [[Chanel|House of Chanel]] in Paris. They inherited that company and the horse racing business from their father [[Jacques Wertheimer|Jacques]] who had inherited a racing stable from his parents [[Pierre Wertheimer|Pierre and Germaine Wertheimer]]. 

The brothers operate as La Presle Farm and/or Wertheimer Farm in the United States and in France as Wertheimer et Frère where they have won numerous important [[Conditions races]].

[[Alec Head]] [[horse trainer|trained]] for the family in Europe until his retirement in 1984 but for a number of years continued to act as their bloodstock advisor. Head's daughter [[Criquette Head-Maarek|Christiane "Criquette" Head]] took over as trainer in 1983 and continued to have great success until they ended their working relationship in 2006.

In the United States, the Wertheimer brothers won the 1993 [[Breeders' Cup Turf]] and earned [[American Horse of the Year]] honors with [[Kotashaan]]. In 2003, they won the [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies]] with [[Halfbridled]]. Both horses were trained by [[Richard Mandella]].

In 2008, 2009, and 2010, their filly [[Goldikova]] won the TVG [[Breeders' Cup Mile]], becoming the only horse to ever win a Breeders' Cup event three times. In 2011, Goldikova competed in the event for a fourth consecutive year, finishing 3rd. Goldikova was trained by [[Freddy Head]] who is the brother of Criquette Head.

== Racing background ==
An interest in racing goes back two generations in a family which has been responsible for the development of a number of top stallions, including Lyphard, Riverman and Green Dancer ... Alain and Gerard’s grandfather, Pierre, was a bastion of the European turf, winning English classics such as the 1956 Epsom Derby. His death in 1965 saw the famous blue and white silks passed on to his widow, who was France’s leading owner in 1972, and when she died in 1974, on again to Jacques … Father Jacques Wertheimer was champion owner in his first full season, sweeping the 1975 French 1,000 Guineas, 2,000 Guineas and Prix du Jockey-Club with Ivanjica, Green Dancer and Val de L’Orne. Ivanjica went on to win the 1976 Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe, an event which fell to Wertheimer again in 1981, courtesy of another filly, Gold River, who had won the Prix Royal Oak (French St Leger) the previous year
