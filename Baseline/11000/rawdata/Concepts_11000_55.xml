'''Active student response (ASR) techniques''' are strategies to elicit observable responses from students in a classroom. They are grounded in the field of behavioralism and operate by increasing opportunities reinforcement during class time, typically in the form of instructor praise.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Van Norman, Renee; Fitzgerald, Nancy; Kaffar, Bradley (2008). "High and Low Technology for Increasing Students' Active Responding in College Classrooms". ''Proceedings of SITE 2008--Society for Information Technology &amp; Teacher Education International Conference'': 1550–1555.&lt;/ref&gt; Active student response techniques are designed so that student behavior, such as responding aloud to a question, is quickly followed by reinforcement if correct.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;R., Joyce, Bruce (1996).

[[OCLC]] 33079138.&lt;/ref&gt; Common form of active student response techniques are choral responding, response cards, guided notes, and clickers. While they are commonly used for disabled populations, these strategies can be applied at many different levels of education.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Tincani, Matt; Twyman, Janet S. (2016).

== History ==
Active student response techniques are grounded in the field of [[behaviorism]], a movement in psychology that believes behaviors are responses to stimuli and motivated by past reinforcement. The field has its origins in experiments of [[Edward Thorndike]], who pioneered the [[Law of effect]], which is now known as reinforcement and punishment. Thorndike explained that behaviors that produce a positive effect become more likely to reoccur, given the same scenario. Conversely, behaviors that produce a negative effect become less likely to reoccur.&lt;ref&gt;G.,, Myers, David. ''Psychology''. DeWall, C. Nathan, 1954- (Twelfth edition ed.). New York. {{ISBN|9781319050627}}. [[OCLC]] 1018431994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[B. F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner]] applied the principles of behaviorism to influence education. Skinner believed that students must be active in the classroom and that effective instruction is based on positive reinforcement. According to Skinner, teachers should avoid punishment, as it only teaches students to avoid punishment. Instead, lessons should be broken into small tasks with clear instruction and positive reinforcement. His beliefs led him to invent the [[teaching machine]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, James G. (1992). "B. F. Skinner (1904-1990): Obituary." ''American Psychologist''. '''47''' (5): 665–667. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1037//0003-066x.47.5.665. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] 0003-066X.&lt;/ref&gt; Active student response techniques use Skinner's model to provide rapid reinforcement for desired responses. This increases the likelihood the responses will occur again. Also, these techniques may give instructors an opportunity to embrace technology in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The foundation of active student response techniques is behaviorism's stimulus-response-reinforcement paradigm. A [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] is any environmental change that may produce a response. In an academic setting, a stimulus is often a verbal cue. The response may be any change by the subject, such as an emotion or a behavior. Reinforcers are either positive or negative. In an academic setting, confirmation of a correct answer may be a positive reinforcer. So, active student response techniques aim to arrange the paradigm so the response is most correct. This includes separating instruction into small, achievable steps, providing clear and quick feedback, and including many repetitions. As a result, the correct response will have a strong relationship to the stimulus, creating more learning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Methods ==

=== Choral responding ===
Choral responding is a low-tech, high-ASR strategy that paces instruction throughout a class. In this strategy, students are prompted to respond orally in unison to questions posed by an instructor. For choral responding to work, questions must be presented clearly, be able to answered briefly, and have one correct answer. Choral responding is useful for reviewing subject matter, solving problems, or spelling words. It may be used to review previously covered content or provide feedback throughout a class period.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Twyman, Janet; Heward, William (2016-05-01). "How to improve student learning in every classroom now". ''International Journal of Educational Research''. '''87'''. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1016/j.ijer.2016.05.007.&lt;/ref&gt; Choral responding is effective in both small- and whole-group instruction, for students from preschool through secondary grades, in both general education and special education, as measured by learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The instructional format for choral responding is the following:

# Instructor poses a question (e.g. "What is 9x9?")
# Appropriate wait-time pause
# Instructor uses a clear signal (e.g. "Tell me.")
# Instructor provides feedback for the majority answer (e.g. Correct! 9x9 is 81.")

=== Response cards ===
Response cards are cards, signs, or other objects held up by students in unison in response to a question posed by an instructor. Write-on response cards, such as whiteboards, allow students to write their answers on the spot and erase between learning trials. Pre-printed response cards are pre-made and are often true/false or colors to indicate answers. Both types of response cards promote high-ASR by allowing all students to respond to all questions, instead of one student responding to each. Instructors can easily gauge learning using response cards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heward, William L (Spring 1997). "FOUR VALIDATED INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES". ''Behavior and Social Issues''. '''7'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The instructional format of response cards is similar to choral responding, as follows:

# Instructor poses a question with a clear, quick response (e.g. "What is the atomic number of carbon?")
# Appropriate wait-time pause for students to write answers
# Instructor uses a clear signal (e.g. "Show me your boards!")
# Instructor provides feedback (e.g. "That's right! The atomic number of carbon is 6.) Occasionally, the instructor may want to address some of the incorrect responses that were given.

Implementing response cards in a classroom may increase questions posed by the instructor, increase academic performance, and be favored by students. The technique is effective in both general education and special education. Response cards may also increase on-task behavior in the classroom and decrease disruptive behavior.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Response cards are most effective when paired with brisk instructional pacing. Instructors have been easily able to implement response cards and achieve a response rate of approximately one response per minute. The brisk instructional pace maximized responses in a class period without sacrificing accuracy and while minimizing problem behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Guided notes ===
Notetaking serves both a process and product function. But, traditional notetaking is dependent on attendance, criterion knowledge, and attention. Often, students may be inefficient note takers by recording incomplete, verbatim notes. Distributing instructor's notes increases academic performance.&lt;ref&gt;Kiewra, Kenneth A. (1987-09-01). "Notetaking and review: The research and its implications". ''Instructional Science''. '''16''' (3): 233–249. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1007/BF00120252. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] 0020-4277.&lt;/ref&gt; Guided notes aims to improve notetaking behavior by ensuring complete and accurate notes.

Guided notes are prepared handouts containing standard cues to guide a student through a lecture. The handouts are often based on the instructor's notes with blank spaces throughout for the student to fill in. In the blank spaces, the student is to complete the information or concept, creating a high-ASR strategy with many response opportunities throughout the lecture. The blank spaces should be varied and may allow for many different types of responses, such as drawing pictures or graphs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While mostly low-tech, guided notes has the option to use many high-tech applications, such as software that makes guided notes from completed notes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Guided notes are used in both K-12 level and college levels. The active student response technique improves assessment scores, accuracy of notes, and student responses during lecture. Most students prefer guided notes over traditional notetaking.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The instructional format of guided notes is as follows:

# Instructor makes an outline of the lecture, and should contain clear typographical cues, such as bullet points
# Instructor replaces some sections with blank spaces where the student will write in the information
# Guided notes are distributed to students for the lecture

Example of guided notes:
 The space between two neurons is the _________. Neurons most often exhibit _______ signaling within cells and _______ signaling between cells.                                                                                                                                             The generation of the _______ potential produces an ______-or-none response. So, greater intensity stimulation produces higher ________.

=== High-tech strategies ===
Response strategies can be implemented using commercially available technologies, such as clickers or mobile phone apps. Similar to response cards, the instructor would pose a question and ask for a response from the class. Some of the process may be automated with a software that uses a clear signal for response and collects student responses. Though, high-tech strategies are not as well researched.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Active student response techniques can be applied to nearly all levels of education. Also, the techniques can be used with multiple populations. The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) prioritizes accessible general education that includes individuals with disabilities, including those with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, and behavior disorders. Active student response benefits the inclusion of students with disabilities in classrooms by facilitating all students' participation in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Higher education may also benefit from active student response techniques.. Undergraduate classrooms would often benefit from implementing the techniques. While traditional lectures serve a function in higher education, such as setting context and synthesizing information, the reliance on passive learning is not as effective as active student learning.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Active student response strategies can be either low- or high-tech. High-tech strategies, which use electrical devices, may utilize mobile phones, clickers, or other devices. Low-tech strategies do not require any electrical devices and may not require anything more than pencil and paper. Examples include guided notes and response cards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The range of technology that can be used broadens the applications of active student response.

== Compared to traditional teaching styles ==
Traditional lecturing, in which an instructor speaks uninterrupted for the majority of the class, is often less effective than active student response techniques. Without active participation from students and contingent positive reinforcement for correct responses, traditional lecturing does not reinforce desired behaviors. Traditional lecturing may allow disorganized delivery of information. Implementing active student response techniques into lectures ensures the lectures function to assess, instruct, plan, and evaluate.

Active student response techniques have been shown to increase learning, compared to traditional lecture. During lectures with active student response, students exhibited more on-task behavior, and instructors received more feedback. Frequency of active student responses is correlated with performance on evaluations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Instructors also remarked that active student participation provides instructors with clear feedback and promotes a more inclusive nature of the classroom.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

However, active student response also demands a higher cost. Instructors must supply or prepare any necessary materials. For example, to implement guided notes, instructors must write and print the notes to distribute to students. Similarly, the techniques demand more time from instructors. It may take added preparation to plan all of the questions throughout class. If an instructor chooses to use response cards, the instructor must prepare questions to which the class can respond.

The quotation "'''All men are created equal'''" has been called an "immortal declaration," and "perhaps [the] single phrase" of the [[American Revolution]]ary period with the greatest "continuing importance."&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Jack P. Greene, ''All Men Are Created Equal: Some Reflections on the Character of the American Revolution'' (1000. p. 5: "Perhaps no single phrase from the Revolutionary era has had such continuing importance in American public life as the dictum 'all men are created equal'".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Wynne Jeudwine, ''Pious Phrases in Politics: An Examination of Some Popular Catchwords, their Misuse and Meanings'' (1919), p. 27, quoting Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]] of [[Illinois]], author of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], as referencing the "immortal declaration that all men are created equal".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] first used the phrase in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|U.S. Declaration of Independence]], which he penned in 1776 during the beginning of the American Revolution. It was thereafter quoted and incorporated into speeches by a wide array of substantial figures in American political and social life in the United States. The final form of the phrase was stylized by [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Merrill. ''Thomas Jefferson and the New Nation: A biography''. p. 90. Oxford University Press, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of Thomas Jefferson's use of the phrase==
Thomas Jefferson, through his friendship with Lafayette, was heavily influenced by French philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], such as Voltaire, Rousseau and Montesquieu. In their often censored writings, those philosophers advocated that men were born free and equal. This later led to the French Revolution of 1789 and the concept of Human Rights (Droits de l'Homme in French).  At the age of 33, Jefferson may have also borrowed the expression from an Italian friend and neighbor, [[Philip Mazzei]],&lt;ref&gt;Philip Mazzei, [[The Virginia Gazette]], 1774. Translated by a friend and neighbor, Thomas Jefferson:&lt;br&gt;
{{quote|''Tutti gli uomini sono per natura egualmente liberi e indipendenti. Quest'eguaglianza è necessaria per costituire un governo libero. Bisogna che ognuno sia uguale all'altro nel diritto naturale.''}} 
Translated by Jefferson as follow: 
{{quote|All men are by nature equally free and independent. Such equality is necessary in order to create a free government.
All men must be equal to each other in natural law}}

He may also have influenced [[Thomas Paine]]'s [[Common Sense (pamphlet)|''Common Sense'']].

{{quote|All men are by nature equally free and independent. Such equality is necessary in order to create a free government.&lt;br /&gt;All men must be equal to each other in natural law}}&lt;/ref&gt; as noted by Joint Resolution 175 of the [[103rd United States Congress|103rd Congress]] as well as by [[John F. Kennedy]] in ''[[A Nation of Immigrants]]''.{{refn|According to Joint Resolution 175 of the 103rd Congress, "the phrase in the Declaration of Independence 'All men are created equal' was suggested by the [[Italians|Italian]] [[patriotism|patriot]] and [[immigrant]] Philip Mazzei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-103hjres175eh/pdf/BILLS-103hjres175eh.pdf|title=103D CONGRESS : 2D SESSION : H. J. RES. 175|publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;"The great doctrine 'All men are created equal' incorporated into the Declaration of Independence by Thomas Jefferson, was paraphrased from the writing of Philip Mazzei, an Italian-born patriot and pamphleteer, who was a close friend of Jefferson." by John F. Kennedy, ''A Nation of Immigrants'' pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776 the [[Second Continental Congress]] asked Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, [[John Adams]], [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]], and [[Roger Sherman]] to write the Declaration of Independence.  This [[Committee of Five]] voted to have Thomas Jefferson write the document.  After Jefferson finished he gave the document to Franklin to proof. Franklin suggested minor changes, one of which stands out far more than the others:  "We hold these truths to be sacred and un-deniable..." became "We hold these truths to be self-evident."

The second paragraph of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] starts as follows: 
{{quote|We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are [[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness|Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness]].-- That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United States Declaration of Independence]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], chiefly authored by [[George Mason]] and approved by the [[Fifth Virginia Convention|Virginia Convention]] on June 12, 1776, contains the wording:
{{quote|all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights of which . . . they cannot deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virginia Declaration of Rights]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

George Mason was an elder-planter who had originally stated [[John Locke]]'s theory of natural rights:
{{quote|All men are born equally free and independent and have certain inherent natural rights of which they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; among which are the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.&lt;ref&gt;Blumrosen, Alfred W. and Ruth G., Slave Nation: How Slavery United the Colonies and Sparked the American Revolution, Sourcebooks, 2005, pp. 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mason's draft was accepted by a small committee and then rejected by the Virginia Convention.  Thomas Jefferson, a competent Virginia lawyer, saw this as a problem in legal writing and chose words that were more acceptable to the Second Continental Congress.

The [[Massachusetts Constitution]], chiefly authored by [[John Adams]] in 1780, contains in its  [[Massachusetts Constitution#Part the First: A Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts|Declaration of Rights]] the wording:

{{quote|Article I. All men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, essential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1780)#Article I|Article I, Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1780)]]&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
 
The plaintiffs in the cases of ''[[Mum Bett|Brom and Bett v. John Ashley]]'' and ''[[Commonwealth v. Nathaniel Jennison]]'' argued that this provision abolished slavery in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPvq0-taGAEC |pages=74–75 |title=Founding the Republic |author=John J. Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter case resulted in a "sweeping declaration . . . that the institution of slavery was incompatible with the principles of liberty and legal equality articulated in the new Massachusetts Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/courts/sjc/constitution-slavery-e.html The Massachusetts Constitution, Judicial Review and Slavery – The Quock Walker Case], Massachusetts Judicial Branch (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has since been considered a hallmark statement in democratic constitutions and similar human rights instruments, many of which have adopted the phrase or variants thereof.{{refn|UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Preamble: Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity, and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world &amp; Article 1: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|publisher=The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Slavery and the phrase==
The contradiction between the claim that "all men are created equal" and the existence of American slavery attracted comment when the Declaration of Independence was first published. Before final approval, Congress, having made a few alterations to some of the wording, also deleted nearly a fourth of the draft, including a passage criticizing the slave trade.  At that time many members of Congress, including Jefferson, owned slaves, which clearly factored into their decision to delete the controversial "anti-slavery" passage. Jefferson, an abolitionist at heart, believed adding such a passage would dissolve the independence movement. Jefferson decades before the declaration of independence, argued in court for abolition of a slave. The court dismissed the case outright. In writing the declaration, Jefferson believed the phrase "all men are created equal" to be self evident, and would ultimately resolve slavery.  &lt;ref name=AFP&gt;Armitage, David. The Declaration Of Independence: A Global History. 76–77. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02282-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776, [[abolitionist]] [[Thomas Day]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over  his affrighted slaves.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
The phrase "all men are created equal" has received criticism from [[Elitism|elitists]] and [[Traditional conservatism|traditional conservatives]]. For instance, [[Richard M. Weaver]] writing in one of the cornerstone works of traditional conservatism, ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'' (1948), paraphrased a 19th-century writer in writing that "no man was ever created free and no two men [were] ever created equal". He continues:
{{quote|The comity of peoples in groups large or small rests not upon this chemerical notion of equality but upon [[fraternity]], a concept which long antedates it in history because it goes immeasurably deeper in human sentiment. The ancient feeling of brotherhood carries obligations of which equality knows nothing. It calls for respect and protection, for brotherhood is status in family, and family is by nature hierarchical.&lt;ref name=WEA&gt;Weaver, Richard. Ideas Have Consequences. 41-42. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1971. {{ISBN|0-226-87678-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legacy==
The [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam|Vietnamese proclamation of independence]], written in 1945, uses the phrase "all men are created equal" and mentions the [[United States Declaration of Independence|U.S. Declaration of Independence]] in it as well.

The [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Rhodesian declaration of independence]], ratified in November 1965, is based on the American one, however, it omits the phrase "all men are created equal", along with "[[Consent of the governed|the consent of the governed]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{refimprove|date=July 2014}}
An '''and-inverter graph (AIG)''' is a directed, acyclic [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] that represents a structural implementation of the logical functionality of a [[digital circuit|circuit or network]].  An AIG consists of two-input nodes representing [[logical conjunction]], terminal nodes labeled with variable names, and edges optionally containing markers indicating [[logical negation]].  This representation of a logic function is rarely structurally efficient for large circuits, but is an efficient representation for manipulation of [[boolean function]]s. Typically, the abstract graph is represented as a [[data structure]] in software.
[[Image:And-inverter-graph.svg|thumb|400px|Two structurally different AIGs for the function f(x1, x2, x3) = x2 * ( x1 + x3 )]]

Conversion from the network of [[logic gate]]s to AIGs is fast and scalable. It only requires that every gate be expressed in terms of [[AND gate]]s and [[inverter (logic gate)|inverters]]. This conversion does not lead to unpredictable increase in memory use and runtime.  This makes the AIG an efficient representation in comparison with either the [[binary decision diagram]] (BDD) or the "sum-of-product" (ΣoΠ) form,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} that is, the [[canonical form (Boolean algebra)|canonical form]] in [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] known as the [[disjunctive normal form]] (DNF). The BDD and DNF may also be viewed as circuits, but they involve formal constraints that deprive them of scalability.  For example, ΣoΠs are circuits with at most two levels while BDDs are canonical, that is, they require that input variables be evaluated in the same order on all paths.

Circuits composed of simple gates, including AIGs, are an "ancient" research topic. The interest in AIGs started with Alan Turing's seminal 1948 paper&lt;ref&gt;Turing's 1948 paper has been re-printed as Turing AM. Intelligent Machinery. In: Ince DC, editor. ''Collected works of AM Turing &amp;mdash; Mechanical Intelligence.'' Elsevier Science Publishers, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; on neural networks, in which he described a randomized trainable network of NAND gates.   Interest continued through the late 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =L. Hellerman|title=A catalog of three-variable Or-Inverter and And-Inverter logical circuits|journal=IEEE Trans. Electron. Comput.|volume=EC-12|date=June 1963|pages=198&amp;ndash;223|doi=10.1109/PGEC.1963.263531|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued in the 1970s when various local transformations have been developed.  These transformations were implemented in several
logic synthesis and verification systems, such as Darringer et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Darringer |author2=W. H. Joyner, Jr. |author3=C. L. Berman |author4=L.

Several important techniques were discovered early at [[IBM]], such as combining and reusing multi-input logic expressions and subexpressions, now known as [[structural hashing]].

Recently there has been a renewed interest in AIGs as a [[Functional Representation|functional representation]] for a variety of tasks in synthesis and verification. That is because representations popular in the 1990s (such as BDDs) have reached their limits of scalability in many of their applications.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Another important development was the recent emergence of much more efficient [[boolean satisfiability]] (SAT) solvers. When coupled with ''AIGs'' as the circuit representation, they lead to remarkable speedups in solving a wide variety of [[boolean problem]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

AIGs found successful use in diverse [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] applications. A well-tuned combination of ''AIGs'' and [[boolean satisfiability]] made an impact on [[formal verification]], including both [[model checking]] and equivalence checking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A.

ICCAD '04|pages=42&amp;ndash;49|date=2004|url=http://www.perbjesse.com/iccad04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing understanding that logic and physical synthesis problems can be solved using simulation and [[boolean satisfiability]] to compute functional properties (such as symmetries)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=K.-H.

ICCAD | pages=254&amp;mdash;261 | date=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mishchenko et al. shows that AIGs are a promising ''unifying'' representation, which can bridge [[logic synthesis]], [[technology mapping]], physical synthesis, and formal verification.  This is, to a large extent, due to the simple and uniform structure of AIGs, which allow rewriting, simulation, mapping, placement, and verification to share the same data structure.

In addition to combinational logic, AIGs have also been applied to [[sequential logic]] and sequential transformations.  Specifically, the method of structural hashing was extended to work for AIGs with memory elements (such as [[flip-flop (electronics)#D flip-flop|D-type flip-flop]]s with an initial state,
which, in general, can be unknown) resulting in a data structure that is specifically tailored for applications related to [[retiming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=J. Baumgartner |author2=A. Kuehlmann |title=Min-area retiming on flexible circuit structures|booktitle= Proc. ICCAD'01|pages=176&amp;ndash;182|date=2001|url=ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/es/info/iwls01_ret.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing research includes implementing a modern logic synthesis system completely based on AIGs.  The prototype called [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/ ABC] features an AIG package, several AIG-based synthesis and equivalence-checking techniques, as well as an experimental implementation of sequential synthesis. One such technique combines technology mapping and retiming in a single optimization step. These optimizations can be implemented using networks composed of arbitrary gates, but the use of AIGs makes them more scalable and easier to implement.

The '''Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial''' is a {{convert|.81|acre|ha}}  [[cenotaph]] complex and [[educational park]] in [[Boise, Idaho]] near the Boise Public Library and the [[Boise Greenbelt|Greenbelt]], the centerpiece of which is a statue of [[Anne Frank]]; it is jointly maintained by the Wassmuth Center for Human rights and the Boise Department of Parks and Recreation, and is the only human rights memorial in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Only Human Rights Memorial in the U.S."&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/article153899354.html |title=Bieter urges crowd to ‘stand up to power’ at anti-hate Anne Frank Memorial ceremony |last=Webb |first=Anna |date=2017-06-01 |website=The Idaho Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by Idaho Falls architect Kurt Karst, a sapling of the [[Anne Frank Tree]] and quotations from some sixty notables and unknowns (including poets, activists, politicians and diplomats, those who survived the [[Holocaust]], and those who did not) are prominent installations.&lt;ref name="Idaho Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://parks.cityofboise.org/parks-locations/parks/idaho-anne-frank-human-rights-memorial/ |title=Idaho Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial |authorlink=Boise Parks &amp; Recreation}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also features one of the few installations where the full text of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is on permanent [[public art|public display]].

'''Anticipation''' is an [[emotion]] involving [[pleasure]], [[wikt:excitement|excitement]], or [[anxiety]] in considering an [[Expectation (epistemic)|expected]] event.{{Attribution needed|date=December 2016}}
{{Emotion}}[[File:Anticipation.svg|thumb|Anticipation is the process of imaginative speculation about the future. The brain uses information about gravity, curvature, obstacles etc. to make a prediction.]]

==As a defence mechanism==
[[Robin Skynner]] considered anticipation as one of "the mature ways of dealing with real stress.... You reduce the stress of some difficult challenge by anticipating what it will be like and preparing for how you are going to deal with it".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (London 1994) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that "the use of mature defenses (sublimation, anticipation) tended to increase with age".&lt;ref&gt;Hope R.Conte/Robert Plutchik, ''Ego Defenses'' (1995) p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desire==
"Anticipation is the central ingredient in sexual desire."&lt;ref&gt;Barry and Emily McCarthy, ''Rekindling Desire'' (2003) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;{{Attribution needed|date=December 2016}} As "sex has a major cognitive component — the most important element for desire is positive anticipation".&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;{{Attribution needed|date=December 2016}} One name for pleasurable anticipation is excitement.{{Attribution needed|date=December 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

More generally, anticipation is a central motivating force in everyday life — "the normal process of imaginative anticipation of, or speculation about, the future".&lt;ref&gt;Clon Campbell, ''The Romantic Ethic and the Spirit of Modern Consumerism'' (2005) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; To enjoy one's life, "one needs a belief in Time as a promising medium to do things in; one needs to be able to suffer the pains and pleasures of anticipation and deferral".&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;{{Attribution needed|date=December 2016}}

==In music==
There is a number of theories explaining anticipation in music. Two prominent theories are the Neurological theories of Chase that attribute expectation building and anticipation both to inherent Neurological pitch evolution (Darwinian selection as pitch/rhythm/harmony communication response expectation) and the related skillful use of chord sequences (holding V7 until expectations are met with E, A, B7, or the well known Am/D7/G tease-satisfy sequence, with variations in the [[wheel of fifths]]). 

A second well-accepted theory is Huron's "ITPRA" 5 module theory of expectation, where previous imaginative tension hits the event onset/horizon, with prediction and reaction oscillating (alternating) in the response system, and resulting in appraisal feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Chase, "How Music Really Works" (Vancouver, 2006), {{ISBN|1-897311-55-9}}, pp. 434, 621&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Huron,"Sweet Anticipation, Music and the psychology of expectation" (Cambridge, 2006), {{ISBN|978-0-262-58278-0}}, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

From a global perspective, even given thousands of varying scale types worldwide, there is a universal human sense of satisfaction in the return to that scale's tonic (for example, C, in the major scale, key, and tonic of C major).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hewitt,"Musical Scales of the World" (London, 2013), {{ISBN|978-095-7547-001}}, p. 11 et. al&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the broader topic of [[Music and emotion]], Juslin &amp; Västfjäll's BRECVEM model includes, as its seventh element, Musical expectation.&lt;ref&gt;Juslin, Liljeström, Västfjäll, &amp; Lundqvist. (2010). How does music evoke emotions? Exploring the underlying mechanisms. In P.N. Juslin &amp; J. Sloboda (Eds.), ''Handbook of Music and Emotion: Theory, Research, and Applications'' (pp. 605-642). Oxford: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199604968}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically, anticipation also refers specifically to a [[Nonchord tone#Anticipation|type of nonchord tone]].

''Note: this section refers to the process of generating the thought or feeling of anticipation in music. For titles of songs with the word Anticipation, see [[Anticipation (disambiguation)]].''

==In phenomenology==
For [[Phenomenological philosophy|phenomenological philosopher]] [[Edmund Husserl]], anticipation is an essential feature of human action. "In every action we know the goal in advance in the form of an anticipation that is 'empty', in the sense of vague...and [we] seek by our action to bring it step by step to concrete realization".&lt;ref&gt;E. Husserl, in [[Alfred Schütz|Alfred Schutz]], ''The Phenomenology of the Social World'' (Illinois 1997), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Anticipation can be shown in many ways; for example, some people seem to smile uncontrollably during this period, while others seem ill or sick. It is not uncommon for the brain to be so focused on an event, that the body is affected in such a way. [[glossophobia|Stage fright]] is a type of anticipation, stemming from the actor or actress hoping that they perform well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadreadycases.com/resources/stage-fright.html|title=Understanding Stage Fright|website=www.roadreadycases.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' and subsequent [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|film]] use the phrase in a literal way, with Dr. Frank-N-Furter saying "I see you shiver with antici.......pation" (holding the breath between antici- and -pation for several seconds) during "[[Sweet Transvestite]]". Since the movie became a [[cult film]], it has become one of the most iconic and highly quoted lines.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6027">'''Apperception''' (from the [[Latin]] ''ad-'', "to, toward" and ''percipere'', "to perceive, gain, secure, learn, or feel") is any of several aspects of perception and consciousness in such fields as [[psychology]], [[philosophy]] and [[epistemology]].

==Meaning in philosophy==
The term originates with [[René Descartes]] in the form of the word ''apercevoir'' in his book ''Traité des passions''. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] introduced the concept of apperception into the more technical philosophical tradition, in his work ''Principes de la nature fondés en raison et de la grâce''; although he used the word practically in the sense of the modern [[attention]], by which an object is apprehended as "not-self" and yet in relation to the self.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apperception |volume=2 |page=221}} This cites:
*Karl Lange, ''Ueber Apperception'' (6th ed. revised, Leipzig, 1899; trans. E. E. Brown, Boston, 1893)
*[[George Stout|G. F. Stout]], ''Analytic Psychology'' (London, 1896), bk. ii. ch. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] distinguished [[transcendental apperception]] from empirical apperception.  The first is the perception of an object as involving the consciousness of the pure self as subject--"the pure, original, unchangeable consciousness that is the necessary condition of experience and the ultimate foundation of the unity of experience."  The second is "the consciousness of the concrete actual self with its changing states", the so-called "inner sense." (Otto F. Kraushaar in ''Runes''&lt;ref name="Dagobert D 1972"&gt;[[Dagobert D. Runes|Runes, Dagobert D.]] (ed.), ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', Littlefield, Adams, and Company, Totowa, NJ, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Transcendental apperception is almost equivalent to self-consciousness; the existence of the ego may be more or less prominent, but it is always involved.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  See ''[[Kantianism]]''.

===Meaning in the writings of Theodor Lipps===
The German philosopher [[Theodor Lipps]] distinguished the terms perception and apperception in his 1902 work, ''Vom Fühlen, Wollen und Denken''.&lt;ref&gt;Lipps, Theodor. ''Vom Fuehlen, Wollen und Denken.'' Leipzig, Verlag von Johann Ambrosius Barth, 1902. See pages 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Perception, for Lipps, is a generic term that covers such psychic occurrences as auditory and tactile sensations, recollections, visual representations in memory, etc. But these perceptions do not always hold our conscious attention - perception is not always consciously noticed. Lipps uses the term apperception, then, to refer to attentive perception, wherein, in addition to merely perceiving an object, either one also consciously attends to the perceived object or one also attends to the very perception of the object.&lt;ref&gt;''Judgement and Truth in Early Analytic Philosophy and Phenomenology''. ed. Mark Textor. Springer, 2013. pp. 14f.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Meaning in psychology==
In [[psychology]], apperception is "the process by which new experience is assimilated to and transformed by the residuum of past experience of an individual to form a new whole."&lt;ref name="Dagobert D 1972"/&gt; In short, it is to perceive new experience in relation to past experience. The term is found in the early psychologies of [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Hermann Lotze]], and [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. It originally means passing the threshold into consciousness, i.e., to perceive. But the percept is changed when reaching consciousness due to the contextual presence of the other stuff already there, thus it is not perceived but apperceived.

According to [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] apperception is that process by which an aggregate or "mass" of presentations becomes systematized (''apperceptions-system'') by the accretion of new elements, either sense-given or product of the inner workings of the mind.  He thus emphasizes in apperception the connection with the self as resulting from the sum of antecedent experience.  Hence in education the teacher should fully acquaint himself with the mental development of the pupil, in order that he may make full use of what the pupil already knows.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Apperception is thus a general term for all mental processes in which a presentation is brought into connection with an already existent and systematized mental conception, and thereby is classified, explained or, in a word, understood; e.g. a new scientific phenomenon is explained in the light of phenomena already analysed and classified. The whole intelligent life of man is, consciously or unconsciously, a process of apperception, in as much as every act of attention involves the appercipient process.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Example===
A rich child and a poor child walking together come across the same ten dollar bill on the sidewalk. The rich child says it is not very much money and the poor child says it is a lot of money. The difference lies in how they ''apperceive'' the same event – the lens of past experience through which they see and value (or devalue) the money.|Christopher Ott&lt;ref&gt;Ott, Christopher, ''The Evolution of Perception and the Cosmology of Substance'', iUniverse, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Meaning in epistemology==
In [[epistemology]], apperception is "the introspective or reflective apprehension by the mind of its own inner states".&lt;ref name="Dagobert D 1972"/&gt;

In the period from 1885 to 1908, many well-documented atrocities were perpetrated in the [[Congo Free State]] (today the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) which, at the time, was a [[colonialism|colony]] under the personal rule of [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II of Belgium]]. These atrocities were sometimes collectively referred to by European contemporaries as the "Congo Horrors", and were particularly associated with the labour policies used to collect [[natural rubber]] for export. Together with epidemic disease, famine, and a falling birth rate caused by these disruptions, the atrocities contributed to a sharp decline in the Congolese population. The magnitude of the population fall over the period is disputed, but it is thought to be between one and 15 million people.

At the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–85, the European powers allocated the [[Congo Basin]] region to a private charitable organisation run by Leopold II, who had long held ambitions for colonial expansion. The territory under Leopold's control exceeded {{convert|1,000,000|mi2|km2|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} and, amid financial problems, was ruled by a tiny cadre of white administrators drawn from across Europe. Initially, the colony proved unprofitable and insufficient, with the state always close to bankruptcy. The boom in demand for [[natural rubber]], which was abundant in the territory, created a radical shift in the 1890s—to facilitate the extraction and export of rubber, all "uninhabited" land in the Congo was nationalised, with the majority distributed to private companies as [[Concession (contract)|concessions]]. Some was kept by the state. Between 1891 and 1906, the companies were allowed to do whatever they wished with almost no judicial interference, the result being that [[forced labour]] and violent coercion were used to collect the rubber cheaply and maximise profit. A native paramilitary army, the ''[[Force Publique]]'', was also created to enforce the labour policies. Individual workers who refused to participate in rubber collection could be killed and entire villages razed. Individual white administrators were also free to indulge their own sadism.

Despite these atrocities, the main cause of the population decline was disease. A number of pandemics, notably [[African trypanosomiasis|African sleeping sickness]], [[smallpox]], [[swine influenza]], and [[amoebic dysentery]], ravaged indigenous populations. In 1901 alone it was estimated that 500,000 Congolese had died from sleeping sickness. Disease, famine and violence combined to reduce the birth-rate while [[excess death]]s rose.

The severing of workers' hands achieved particular international notoriety. These were sometimes cut off by ''Force Publique'' soldiers who were made to account for every shot they fired by bringing back the hands of their victims. These details were recorded by [[Christian mission|Christian missionaries]] working in the Congo and caused public outrage when they were made known to the public in the United Kingdom, Belgium, the United States and elsewhere. An international campaign against the Congo Free State began in 1890 and reached its apogee after 1900 under the leadership of the British activist [[E. D. Morel]]. In 1908, as a result of international pressure, the Belgian government annexed the Congo Free State to form the [[Belgian Congo]], and ended many of the systems responsible for the abuses. The size of the population decline during the period is the subject of extensive [[historiography|historiographical]] debate, and there is an open debate as to whether the atrocities constitute genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanley|first1=Tim|title=Belgium's Heart of Darkness|url=http://www.historytoday.com/tim-stanley/belgiums-heart-darkness|website=History Today|accessdate=6 March 2017|ref=Stanley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ankomah|first1=Baffour|title=The Butcher of Congo|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/35/181.html|website=AfricaAsia.com|accessdate=6 March 2017|ref=Anomakah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the Belgian monarchy nor the Belgian state have ever apologized for the atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/an-unsettling-visit-to-kongo|title=A Belgian Visit to “Kongo”|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Kongovrijstaat.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of the [[Congo Free State]] in 1892]]
Even before his accession to the throne of [[Belgium]] in 1865, the future king [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand and enhance Belgian prestige.{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=12–5}} Politically, however, colonisation was unpopular in Belgium as it was perceived as a risky and expensive gamble with no obvious benefit to the country and his many attempts to persuade politicians met with little success.{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=12–5}}

Determined to look for a colony for himself and inspired by recent reports from central Africa, Leopold began patronising a number of leading explorers, including [[Henry Morton Stanley]].{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=12–5}} Leopold established the [[International African Association]] (''Association internationale africaine''), a "charitable" organisation to oversee the exploration and surveying of a territory based around the [[Congo River]], with the stated goal of bringing humanitarian assistance and civilisation to the natives. In the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–85, European leaders officially recognised Leopold's control over the {{convert|2,350,000|km2|abbr=on}} of the notionally-independent [[Congo Free State]] on the grounds that it would be a [[free trade]] area and [[buffer state]] between British and French spheres of influence.{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=253–5}} In the Free State, Leopold exercised total personal control without much delegation to subordinates.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=171}} African chiefs played an important role in the administration by implementing government orders within their communities.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=172}} Throughout much of its existence, however, Free State presence in the territory that it claimed was patchy, with its few officials concentrated in a number of small and widely dispersed "stations" which controlled only small amounts of hinterland.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=275}} In 1900, there were just 3,000 white people in the Congo, of whom only half were Belgian.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=63}} The colony was perpetually short of administrative staff and officials, who numbered between 700 and 1,500 during the period.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=173}}

In the early years of the colony, much of the administration's attention was focused on consolidating its control by fighting the African peoples on the colony's periphery who resisted colonial rule. These included the tribes around the [[Kwango river]], in the south-west, and the [[Uele River|Uélé]] in the north-east.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=60}} Some of the violence of the period can be attributed to African groups using colonial support to settle scores or white administrators acting without state approval.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=91}}

===Economic and administrative situation===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="Ultimately the state's policy towards its African subjects became dominated by the demands which were made—both by the state itself and by the concessionary companies—for labour for the collection of wild produce of the territory. The system itself engendered abuses&amp;nbsp;..."|2=Ruth Slade (1962){{sfn|Slade|1962|p=178}}}}

The Free State was intended, above all, to be profitable for its investors and Leopold in particular.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=274}} Its finances were frequently precarious. Early reliance on [[ivory]] exports did not make as much money as hoped and the colonial administration was frequently in debt, nearly defaulting on a number of occasions.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=272}} A boom in demand for [[natural rubber]] in the 1890s, however, ended these problems as the colonial state was able to force Congolese males to work as forced labour collecting wild rubber which could then be exported to Europe and North America.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=272}} The rubber boom transformed what had been an unexceptional colonial system before 1890 and led to significant profits.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|pp=78–9}} Exports rose from 580 to 3,740 tons between 1895 and 1900.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=37}}

In order to facilitate economic extraction from the colony, land was divided up under the so-called Domain System (''régime domanial'') in 1891.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=265}}{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=177}} All vacant land, including forests and areas not under cultivation, was decreed to be "[[Terra nullius|uninhabited]]" and thus the possession of the state, leaving many of the Congo's resources (especially rubber and ivory) under direct colonial ownership.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=265}}{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=79}} [[Concession (territory)|Concessions]] were allocated to private companies. In the north, the ''[[Société Anversoise]]'' was given {{convert|160,000|km2|abbr=on}}, while the [[Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company]] (ABIR) was given a comparable territory in the south.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=87}} The ''[[Compagnie du Katanga]]'' and ''[[Compagnie des Grands Lacs]]'' were given smaller concessions in the south and east respectively. Leopold kept a large proportion of territory under personal rule, known as the Crown Domain (''Domaine de la Couronne''), of {{convert|250,000|km2|abbr=on}} which was added to the territory he already controlled under the Private Domain (''Domaine privé'').{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=87}}{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=37}} "The major economic exploitation of the Congolese interior, therefore, lay in the hands of the king and a few privileged concessionaries."{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=87}} The system was extremely profitable and ABIR made a turnover of over 100 per cent on its initial stake in a single year.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=38}} The King made 70 million [[Belgian franc]]s' profit from the system between 1896 and 1905.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=177}} The Free State's concession system was soon copied by other colonial regimes, notably those in the neighbouring [[French Congo]].{{sfn|Vangroenweghe|2006|pp=323–6}}

==Atrocities==

===Red Rubber system and forced labour===
[[File:StoryoftheCongoFreeState 280.jpg|thumb|upright|Congolese labourers tapping [[Cryptostegia grandiflora|rubber vines]] near [[Lusambo]] in [[Kasai region|Kasai]]]]
With the majority of the Free State's revenues derived from the export of rubber, a labour policy (known by critics as the "Red Rubber system") was created to maximise its extraction. Labour was demanded by the administration as taxation.{{efn|Demanding taxation in the form of forced labour was common across colonial Africa at the time.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|pp=267–8}}}} This created a "slave society" as companies became increasingly dependent on forcibly mobilising Congolese labour for their collection of rubber.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=28}} The state recruited a number of black officials, known as ''capitas'', to organise local labour.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=28}} However, the desire to maximise rubber collection, and hence the state's profits, meant that the centrally-enforced demands were often set arbitrarily without considering the numbers or the welfare of workers.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|pp=267–8}} In the concessionary territories, the private companies which had purchased a concession from the Free State administration were able to use virtually any measures they wished to increase production and profits without state interference.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=272}} The lack of a developed bureaucracy to oversee any commercial methods produced an atmosphere of "informality" throughout the state in regards to the operation of enterprises, which in turn facilitated abuses.{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=51}} Treatment of labourers (especially the duration of service) was not regulated by law and instead was left to the discretion of officials on the ground.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|pp=267–8}} [[Abir Congo Company|ABIR]] and the ''Anversoise'' were particularly noted for the harshness with which officials treated Congolese workers. The historian [[Jean Stengers]] described regions controlled by these two companies as "veritable hells-on-earth".{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=270}}

[[File:Vauthier Rene Le Congo Belge 159 Les sentinelles de la Princesse Clementine.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Force Publique]]'' soldiers photographed in 1900]]
Workers who refused to supply their labour were coerced with "constraint and repression". Dissenters were beaten or whipped with the ''[[chicotte]]'', hostages were taken to ensure prompt collection and punitive expeditions were sent to destroy villages which refused.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|pp=267–8}} The policy led to a collapse of Congolese economic and cultural life, as well as farming in some areas.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=94}} Much of the enforcement of rubber production was the responsibility of the ''[[Force Publique]]'', the colonial military. The ''Force'' had originally been established in 1885, with white officers and NCOs and black soldiers, and recruited from as far afield as [[Zanzibar]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Liberia]].{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|pp=76–7}} In the Congo, it recruited from specific ethnic and social demographics.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=173}} These included the [[Ngala people|Bangala]], and this contributed to the spread of the [[Lingala]] language across the country, and freed slaves from the eastern Congo.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|pp=76–7}} The so-called [[Zappo Zap|Zappo-Zaps]] (from the [[Songye people|Songye ethnic group]]) were the most feared. Reportedly cannibals, the Zappo-Zaps frequently abused their official positions to raid the countryside for slaves.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=181}} By 1900, the ''Force Publique'' numbered 19,000 men.{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=123}}

The red rubber system emerged with the creation of the concession regime in 1891{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=22}} and lasted until 1906 when the concession system was restricted.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=270}} At its height, it was heavily localised in the [[Équateur (former province)|Équateur]], [[Bandundu Province|Bandundu]], and [[Kasai region|Kasai]] regions.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=96}}

===Mutilation and brutality===
[[File:Victim of Congo atrocities, Congo, ca. 1890-1910 (IMP-CSCNWW33-OS10-19).jpg|thumb|A missionary points to the severed hand of a Congolese villager. Severed hands were "the most potent symbol of colonial brutality" in the Congo.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=30}}]]

Failure to meet the rubber collection quotas was punishable by death. Meanwhile, the Force Publique were required to provide the hand of their victims as proof when they had shot and killed someone, as it was believed that they would otherwise use the munitions (imported from Europe at considerable cost) for hunting. As a consequence, the rubber quotas were in part paid off in chopped-off hands. Sometimes the hands were collected by the soldiers of the Force Publique, sometimes by the villages themselves. There were even small wars where villages attacked neighboring villages to gather hands, since their rubber quotas were too unrealistic to fill. A Catholic priest quotes a man, Tswambe, speaking of the hated state official Léon Fiévez, who ran a district along the river {{convert|300|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} north of [[Pool Malebo|Stanley Pool]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All blacks saw this man as the devil of the [[Equator]] ... From all the bodies killed in the field, you had to cut off the hands. He wanted to see the number of hands cut off by each soldier, who had to bring them in baskets ... A village which refused to provide rubber would be completely swept clean. As a young man, I saw [Fiévez's] soldier Molili, then guarding the village of Boyeka, take a net, put ten arrested natives in it, attach big stones to the net, and make it tumble into the river ... Rubber causes these torments; that's why we no longer want to hear its name spoken. Soldiers made young men kill or [[rape]] their own mothers and sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, ''King Leopold's Ghost'', p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One junior officer described a raid to punish a village that had protested. The officer in command "ordered us to cut off the heads of the men and hang them on the village palisades ... and to hang the women and the children on the palisade in the form of a cross".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourne |first=Henry Richard Fox |title=Civilisation in Congoland: A Story of International Wrong-doing |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jWccAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Civilisation+in+Congoland%22#PPR3,M1 |accessdate=2007-09-26 |year=1903 |publisher=P. S. King &amp; Son |location=London |pages=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing a Congolese person killed for the first time, a Danish missionary wrote, "The soldier said 'Don't take this to heart so much. They kill us if we don't bring the rubber. The Commissioner has promised us if we have plenty of hands he will shorten our service.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forbath |first=Peter |title=The River Congo: The Discovery, Exploration and Exploitation of the World's Most Dramatic Rivers |year=1977 |publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]] |location= |isbn=0-06-122490-1 |pages=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Forbath's words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The baskets of severed hands, set down at the feet of the European post commanders, became the symbol of the Congo Free State. ... The collection of hands became an end in itself. ''Force Publique'' soldiers brought them to the stations in place of rubber; they even went out to harvest them instead of rubber ... They became a sort of currency. They came to be used to make up for shortfalls in rubber quotas, to replace ... the people who were demanded for the forced labour gangs; and the ''Force Publique'' soldiers were paid their bonuses on the basis of how many hands they collected.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In theory, each right hand proved a killing. In practice, to save ammunition soldiers sometimes "cheated" by simply cutting off the hand and leaving the victim to live or die. More than a few survivors later said that they had lived through a massacre by acting dead, not moving even when their hands were severed, and waiting till the soldiers left before seeking help. In some instances a soldier could shorten his service term by bringing more hands than the other soldiers, which led to widespread mutilations and dismemberment. Other practices used to force workers to collect rubber were taking women and family members hostage.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=31}}

Aside from rubber collection, violence in the Free State chiefly occurred in connection with wars and rebellions. Native states, notably [[Msiri]]'s [[Yeke Kingdom]], the [[Zande Federation]], and Swahili-speaking territory in the eastern Congo under [[Tippu Tip]], refused to recognise colonial authority and were defeated by the ''Force Publique'' with great brutality, during the [[Congo Arab war]].{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=33}} In 1895, [[Batetela Rebellion|a military mutiny]] broke out among the Batetela in Kasai, leading to a 4-year insurgency. The conflict was particularly brutal and caused a great number of casualties.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=82}}

Leopold II was reported to have disapproved of the dismemberments, not on human rights grounds but because it harmed his economic interests. He was quoted as saying "Cut off hands - that's idiotic. I'd cut off all the rest of them, but not hands. That's the one thing I need in the Congo."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/may/13/features11.g22|title=The hidden holocaust|date=1999-05-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population decline==

===Causes===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="I suggest that it is impossible to separate deaths caused by massacre and starvation from those due to the pandemic of sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis) which decimated central Africa at the time."|2=[[Neal Ascherson]] (1999){{sfn|Ascherson|1999|p=9}}}}

Historians generally agree that a dramatic reduction in the overall size of the Congolese population occurred during the two decades of Free State rule in the Congo.{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=46}} It is argued that the reduction in the Congo was atypical and can be attributed to the direct and indirect effects of colonial rule and especially to disease and falling birthrate.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=37}}

The historian [[Adam Hochschild]] argued that the dramatic fall in the Free State population was the result of a combination of "murder", "starvation, exhaustion and exposure", "disease" and "a plummeting birth rate".{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=226}} [[Roger Casement]], concurs with this view.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, A. pp. 226–232.&lt;/ref&gt; [[African trypanosomiasis|Sleeping sickness]] was also a major cause of fatality at the time. Opponents of Leopold's rule stated, however, that the administration itself was to be considered responsible for the spreading of the epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, A. pp. 230–231.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is impossible to be sure in the absence of records, violence and murder represented only a portion of the total. In a local study of the [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] and [[Kete people]]s, the historian [[Jan Vansina]] estimated that violence accounted for the deaths of less than five percent of the population.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=136}}

[[File:Trypanosoma sp. PHIL 613 lores.jpg|thumb|left|[[African trypanosomiasis]], estimated to have killed more than 500,000 Congolese in 1901 alone]]
Diseases imported by Arab traders, European colonists and African porters ravaged the Congolese population and "greatly exceeded" the numbers killed by violence.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=137}} [[Smallpox]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[amoebic dysentery]], venereal diseases (especially [[syphilis]] and [[gonorrhea]]), and [[swine influenza]] were particularly severe.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=138}} Sleeping sickness, in particular, was "epidemic in large areas" of the Congo and had a high mortality rate.{{sfn|Lyons|1992|p=7}} In 1901 alone, it is estimated that as many as 500,000 Congolese died from sleeping sickness.{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=231}} Vansina estimated that five percent of the Congolese population perished from swine influenza.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|pp=143–4}} In areas in which dysentery became endemic, between 30 and 60 percent of the population could die.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=143}} Vansina also pointed to the effects of malnutrition and food shortages in reducing immunity to the new diseases.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=136}} The disruption of African rural populations may have helped to spread diseases further.{{sfn|Ascherson|1999|p=9}} Nevertheless, historian Roger Anstey wrote that "a strong strand of local, oral tradition holds the rubber policy to have been a greater cause of death and depopulation than either the scourge of sleeping sickness or the periodic ravages of smallpox."{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=46}}

It is also widely believed that birth rates fell during the period too, meaning that the growth rate of the population fell relative to the [[natural death]] rate. Vansina, however, notes that precolonial societies had high birth and death rates, leading to a great deal of natural population fluctuation over time.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=146}} Among the Kuba, the period 1880 to 1900 was actually one of population expansion.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=137}}

===Estimates===
A reduction of the population of the Congo is noted by all who have compared the country at the beginning of Leopold's control with the beginning of Belgian state rule in 1908, but estimates of the death toll vary considerably. Estimates of some contemporary observers suggest that the population decreased by half during this period. According to [[E. D. Morel|Edmund D. Morel]], the Congo Free State counted "20 million souls".&lt;ref&gt;Morel, E. D. (1904) ''King Leopold's Rule in Africa''. London: William Heinnemann, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, [[Mark Twain]] mentioned the number of ten million deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Twain, M. (1905) ''King Leopold’s soliloquy a defense of his Congo rule''. Boston: P. R. Warren Co., p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Other estimates of the size of the overall population decline (or [[mortality displacement]]) range between two and 13 million.{{efn|The first census taken in the Congo was in 1924, so it is impossible to be sure of the size of the population at either the beginning or the end of the Free State period.{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=233}}{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=128}}}} Ascherson cites an estimate by Casement of a population fall of three million, although he notes that it is "almost certainly an underestimate".{{sfn|Ascherson|1999|pp=9, 251}}

In the absence of a [[census]] providing even an initial idea of the size of population of the region at the inception of the Congo Free State (the first was taken in 1924),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shelton |first=D. |title=Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity |year=2005 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] |isbn=0-02-865849-3 |pages=621}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is impossible to quantify population changes in the period. Despite this, Forbath more recently claimed the loss was at least five million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forbath |first=P. |title=The River Congo: The Discovery, Exploration, and Exploitation of the World's Most Dramatic River, 1991 (Paperback) |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0-06-122490-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Hochschild]] and [[Jan Vansina]] use the number 10 million. Hochschild cites several recent independent lines of investigation, by anthropologist Jan Vansina and others, that examine local sources (police records, religious records, oral traditions, genealogies, personal diaries), which generally agree with the assessment of the 1919 Belgian government commission: roughly half the population perished during the Free State period. Since the first official census by the Belgian authorities in 1924 put the population at about 10 million, these various approaches suggest a rough estimate of a total of 10 million dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Hochschild |authorlink=Adam Hochschild |title=King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-74329-160-3 |pages=225–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Vansina returned to the issue of quantifying the total population decline, and revised his earlier position, he concluded that the Kuba population (one of the many Congolese populations) was rising during the first two decades of Leopold II's rule, and declined with 25 percent from 1900 to 1919, mainly due to sickness.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Vansina is an anthropologist that made quantitative estimates based on qualitative research.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vansina, Jan (2010). ''Being Colonized: The Kuba Experience in Rural Congo, 1880–1960''. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press. pp. 127–149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanthemsche, Guy (2012). ''Belgium and the Congo, 1885–1980''. New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-19421-1}}. p 25&lt;/ref&gt; Others argued a decrease of 20 percent over the first forty years of colonial rule (up to the census of 1924).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.congo2005.be/geheugen/brochureEN.pdf pages 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Congolese historian Isidore Ndaywel è Nziem 13 million died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Histoire générale du Congo: De l'héritage ancien à la République Démocratique|author=Ndaywel è Nziem, I}}&lt;/ref&gt; To put these population changes in context, sourced references state that in 1900 [[Africa]] as a whole had between 90 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=G. |title=What Went Wrong with Africa? |department=Review |journal=[[African Studies Review]] |volume=49 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=179–181 |doi=10.1353/arw.2006.0081}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 133 million people.&lt;ref&gt;World Population Prospects: The 2006 Revision&lt;/ref&gt; However, no verifiable records exist. Louis and Stengers state that population figures at the start of Leopold's control are only "wild guesses", while calling E. D. Morel's attempt and others at coming to a figure for population losses "but figments of the imagination".&lt;ref&gt;Louis, R. and Stengers, J. (1968) ''E.D. Morel's History of the Congo Reform Movement.'' Oxford: Clarendon, pp. 252–257.&lt;/ref&gt; However, authors that point out the lack of reliable demographic data are questioned by others calling the former minimalists and agnosticists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Roes |first1= A |year= 2010 |title= Towards a History of Mass Violence in the Etat Indépendant du Congo, 1885–1908 |url= |journal= South African Historical Journal |volume= 62 |issue= 4 |page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; proving that these questions remain the object of heated debate.

Since the first census of the Congolese population was made in 1924,{{efn|The accuracy of the 1924 census has itself been criticised.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=24}} }} there is a consensus among historians that accurate predictions of the population fall or number of deaths is impossible.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=24}}

==Investigation and international awareness==
[[File:Punch congo rubber cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1906 cartoon from the British satirical magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' showing a Congolese worker, entangled by a rubber snake with the head of Leopold II ]]

Eventually, growing scrutiny of Leopold's regime led to [[Congo Free State propaganda war|a popular campaign movement]], centered in the United Kingdom and the United States, to force Leopold to renounce his ownership of the Congo. In many cases, the campaigns based their information on reports from British and Swedish missionaries working in the Congo.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=179}}

The first international protest occurred in 1890 when [[George Washington Williams]], an American, published an open letter to Leopold about abuses he had witnessed.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=36}} Public interest in the abuses in the Congo Free State grew sharply from 1895, when the [[Stokes Affair]] and reports of mutilations reached the European and American public which began to discuss the "Congo Question".{{sfn|Slade|1962|pp=178–9}} To appease public opinion, Leopold instigated a Commission for the Protection of Natives (''Commission pour la Protection des Indigènes''), composed of foreign missionaries, but made few serious efforts at substantive reform.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=180}}

In Britain, the campaign was led by the activist and pamphleteer [[E. D. Morel]] after 1900, whose book ''[[Red Rubber]]'' (1906) reached a mass audience. Notable members of the campaign included the novelists [[Mark Twain]], Joseph Conrad and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] as well as Belgian socialists such as [[Emile Vandervelde]].{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=39}} Campaigning groups, especially the [[Congo Reform Association]], inspired by its founder's [[Casement Report]], did not oppose colonialism and instead sought to end the excesses of the Free State by encouraging Belgium to annex the colony officially. This would avoid damaging the delicate balance of power between France and Britain on the continent. While supporters of the Free State regime attempted to argue against claims of atrocities, a Commission of Enquiry, appointed by the regime in 1904, confirmed the stories of atrocities and pressure on the Belgian government increased.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=26}}

In 1908, as a direct result of this campaign, Belgium formally annexed the territory, creating the [[Belgian Congo]].{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=657; 663}} Conditions for the indigenous population improved dramatically with the suppression of forced labour, although many officials who had formerly worked for the Free State were retained in their posts long after annexation.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=271}} Instead of mandating labour for colonial enterprises directly, the Belgian administration used a coercive tax that deliberately pressured Congolese to find work with European employers to procure the necessary funds to make the payments. For some time after the end of the Free State the Congolese were also required to provide a certain number of days of service per year for infrastructure projects. In spite of these measures, the legacy of the population decline of Leopold's reign left the colonial government with a severe labour shortage and it often had to resort to mass migrations to provide workers to emerging businesses.{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=52}}

==Historiography and the term "genocide"==
The significant number of deaths under the Free State regime has led to some scholars to relate the atrocities to later genocides, though understanding of the losses under the colonial administration's rule as the result of harsh economic exploitation has led others to dispute the comparison.{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=87}} According to the [[United Nations]]' 1948 definition of the term "genocide", a genocide must be "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group".{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=255}} Sociologist [[Rhoda Howard-Hassmann]] stated that because the Congolese were not killed in a systematic fashion according to this criterion, "technically speaking, this was not genocide even in a legally retroactive sense."{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=88}} Historians Hochschild and [[Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja]] have rejected allegations of genocide in the Free State because there is no evidence of a policy of deliberate extermination or the desire to eliminate any specific population groups,{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=255}}{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=22}} though the latter added that nevertheless there was "a death toll of [[Holocaust]] proportions."{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=88}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="...&amp;nbsp;no reputable historian of the Congo has made charges of genocide; a forced labor system, although it may be equally deadly, is different."|source=Historian [[Adam Hochschild]] (2005){{sfn|New York Review of Books|2005}}}}

It is generally agreed by historians that extermination was never the policy of the Free State, which benefitted from the labour provided by Congolese workers. The Free State even made some efforts to attempt to tackle the spread of infectious diseases in the Congo by seeking the support of foreign medical institutes such as the [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]].{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=95}}{{sfn|Lyons|1992|p=74}} According to historian [[David Van Reybrouck]], "It would be absurd&amp;nbsp;... to speak of an act of 'genocide' or a 'holocaust'; genocide implies the conscious, planned annihilation of a specific population, and that was never the intention here, or the result&amp;nbsp;... But it was definitely a [[hecatomb]], a slaughter on a staggering scale that was not intentional, but could have been recognised much earlier as the collateral damage of a perfidious, rapacious policy of exploitation".{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=95}} According to Hochschild, "while not a case of genocide, in the strict sense", the atrocities in the Congo were "one of the most appalling slaughters known to have been brought about by human agency".{{sfn|Ascherson|1999|pp=8–9}}{{efn|Hochschild did label the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide|German extermination of the Herero in South-West Africa]] (1904–1907) as a genocide because of its defined, systematic and intentional nature.{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|pp=281–2}}}}

[[File:Hands of Lingomo and Bolengo.tif|thumb|Picture of "Congolese men holding cut off hands" captured by [[Alice Seeley Harris]] in [[Baringa, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Baringa]], May 1904]]
Historians have argued that comparisons drawn in the press by some between the death toll of the Free State atrocities and the Holocaust during [[World War II]] have been responsible for creating undue confusion over the issue of terminology.{{sfn|New York Review of Books|2006}}{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=24}} In one incident, the Japanese newspaper ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' used the word "genocide" in the title of a 2005 article by Hochschild. Hochschild himself criticised the title as "misleading" and stated that it had been chosen "without my knowledge". Similar criticism was echoed by other historians, including [[Jean-Luc Vellut]].{{sfn|New York Review of Books|2006}}{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=95}}

Allegations of genocide in the Free State have become common over time. According to historian [[Timothy J. Stapleton]], "Those who easily apply the term genocide to Leopold's regime seem to do so purely on the basis of its obvious horror and the massive numbers of people who may have perished."{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|pp=88–89}}
One of the few historians to use the term is [[Robert Weisbord]] who argued, in a 2003 article, that there does not have to be intent to exterminate all members of a population in a genocide.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=24}} He posited that "an endeavor to eliminate a portion of a people would qualify as genocide" according to the UN standards and asserted that the Free State did as much. Jeanne Haskin and Yaa-Lengi Meema Ngemi also refer to the atrocities as a genocide.{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=88}} [[Raphael Lemkin]], coiner of the term "genocide", authored a manuscript in the 1950s (it was not published) that asserted the occurrence of "an unambiguous genocide" in the Free State, attributing most of the population decline to the repressive actions of colonial troops.{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=87}} In 2005, an [[early day motion]] before the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]], introduced by [[Andrew Dismore]], called for the recognition of the Congo Free State's atrocities as a "colonial genocide" and called on the Belgian government to issue a formal apology. It was supported by 48 MPs.{{sfn|Early day motion 2251}}

The term "Congolese Genocide" is often used in an unrelated sense to refer to the mass murder and rape committed in the eastern Congo in the aftermath of the [[Rwandan Genocide]] (and the ensuing [[Second Congo War]]) between 1998 and 2003.{{sfn|Drumond|2011}}{{sfn|World Without Genocide|2012}}

'''Autarky''' is the [[quality (philosophy)|quality]] of being [[Self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]]; the term is usually applied to political states or their [[economic system]]s. Autarky exists whenever an entity can survive or continue its activities without external assistance or [[international trade]]. If a self-sufficient [[economy]] also ''refuses'' all trade with the outside world then it is called a '''closed economy'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/c.html#ClosedEconomy|Deardorff's Glossary of International Economics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212072813/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/c.html |date=2007-12-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "closed economy" is also used technically as an abstraction to allow consideration of a single economy without taking foreign trade into account – i.e. as the antonym of [[open economy]]. Autarky in the political sense is not necessarily an economic phenomenon; for example, a [[military]] autarky would be a state that could defend itself without help from another country, or could manufacture all of its weapons without any imports from the outside world.

Autarky as an ideal or method has been embraced by a wide range of [[political ideologies]] and [[Civil rights movements|movements]], especially [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] creeds like [[African socialism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], [[council communism]], [[syndicalism]] (especially [[anarcho-syndicalism]]) and [[Left-wing populism|leftist populism]]. It has also been used in temporary, limited ways by [[Conservatism|conservative]], [[Centrism|centrist]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements, such as the [[American System (economic plan)|American system]], the [[Meiji Restoration#Centralization|Meiji Restoration]], [[social corporatism]], [[Juche]], and [[traditionalist conservatism]]. [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] movements occasionally [[Strasserism|claimed]] to strive for autarky in platform or propaganda, but in practice crushed existing movements towards self-sufficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42462895|title=Italian fascism : its origins &amp; development|orig-year=1938|author=De Grand, Alexander J.|year=2000|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803266227|edition= 3rd|location=Lincoln|oclc=42462895}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained extensive capital connections in efforts to ready for expansionist war and genocide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45896166|title=IBM and the Holocaust : the strategic alliance between Nazi Germany and America's most powerful corporation|last=Edwin.|first=Black,|date=2001|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0609607995|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=45896166}}&lt;/ref&gt; while allying with traditional business elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58452991|title=The anatomy of fascism|last=O.|first=Paxton, Robert|date=2005|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=1400033918|edition= 1st Vintage books|location=New York|oclc=58452991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autarky may be a policy of a state or other entity when it seeks to be self-sufficient as a whole, but also can be limited to a narrow field such as possession of a key raw material. For example, many countries have a policy of autarky with respect to foodstuffs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aic.ucdavis.edu/research1/BerlinSumner.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140120232431/http://aic.ucdavis.edu/research1/BerlinSumner.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and water for national security reasons. By contrast, autarky may be a result of economic isolation or external circumstances in which a state or other entity reverts to localized production when it lacks currency or excess production to trade with the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Computer Simulations of International Trade and Conflict | journal=Economic Interdependence and International Conflict: New Perspectives on an Enduring Debate | editor1=Mansfield, Edward D.|editor2=Pollins, Brian M.  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L53fR-TusZAC | page=333| isbn=0472022938 | date=2009-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Socialism in Provence, 1871–1914 | author=Judt, Tony | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeygBwAAQBAJ | page=263| isbn=9780814743553 | date=2011-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The word ''autarky'' is from the {{lang-el|αὐτάρκεια}}, which means "self-sufficiency" (derived from αὐτο-, "self," and ἀρκέω, "to suffice"). The term is sometimes confused with [[autocracy]] (Greek: αὐτoκρατία "government by single absolute ruler")  or [[autarchy]] (Greek: αὐταρχία – the idea of rejecting government and ruling oneself and no other).

== History ==

===Ancient and medieval===
Early state societies that can be regarded as autarkic include [[nomadic pastoralism]] and [[palace economy]], though over time these tend towards becoming less self-sufficient and more interconnected. The late [[Bronze Age]], for example, saw formerly self-sufficient palace economies rely more heavily on trade, which may have been a contributing factor to the eventual [[Late Bronze Age collapse|Bronze Age Collapse]] when multiple crises hit those systems at once.

[[Medieval commune]]s combined an attempt at overall economic self-sufficiency through the use of common lands and resources with mutual defense pacts against the depredations of the local nobility. Many of these communes later became trading powers such as the [[Hanseatic League]]. In some cases, communal village economies maintained their own debt system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/426794447|title=Debt : the first 5,000 years|last=David.|first=Graeber,|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|isbn=1612191290|location=Brooklyn, N.Y.|oclc=426794447}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a self-sufficient economy and to avoid reliance on possibly hostile aristocratic or business interests.

===19th and early 20th centuries===
Autarkic ambitions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3650099|title=The Populist moment : a short history of the agrarian revolt in America|last=Lawrence.|first=Goodwyn|isbn=0195024176|location=New York|oclc=3650099}}&lt;/ref&gt; can also be seen in the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist]] backlash to the exploitations of free trade in the late 19th-century and in many early [[Utopian socialism|Utopian Socialist]] movements. [[Benefit society|Mutual aid societies]] like the [[National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]] and [[Sovereigns of Industry]] attempted to set up self-sufficient economies (with varying degrees of success) in an effort to be less dependent on what they saw as an exploitative economic system and to generate more power to push for reforms.

Early socialist movements used these autarkic efforts to build their base with institutions like the [[Bourse du Travail|Bourse de travail]], socialist canteens and food assistance. These played a major role in securing workers' loyalty and building those parties into increasingly powerful institutions (especially in Europe) throughout the late 19th and early 20th-centuries. Through these cooperatives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/731911132 |title= The Guns of August: The proud tower |last= Tuchman |first= Barbara W. |year=2012 |publisher= Library of America |others= MacMillan, Margaret |isbn= 159853145X |location= New York, NY |pages=1046 |oclc= 731911132}}&lt;/ref&gt; "workers bought Socialist bread and Socialist shoes, drank Socialist beer, arranged for Socialist vacations and obtained a Socialist education."

Local and regional farming autarkies in many areas of [[Africa]] and [[Southeast Asia]] were displaced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37392803|title=Seeing like a state : how certain schemes to improve the human condition have failed|last=C.|first=Scott, James|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300070160|location=New Haven|oclc=37392803}}&lt;/ref&gt; by European colonial administrations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who sought to push smallholder villages into larger plantations that, while less productive, they could more easily control.

Communist movements embraced or dismissed autarky as a goal at different times. Some socialist communities like [[Charles Fourier]]'s [[Phalanstère|phalansteres]] strove for self-sufficiency. The early [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] strove for a self-sufficient economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40510540|title=Red victory : a history of the Russian Civil War|last=Bruce.|first=Lincoln, W.|year=1999|publisher=Da Capo|isbn=0306809095|edition= 1st Da Capo Press|location=New York|oclc=40510540}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[War communism|War Communism]], but later pursued international trade vigorously under the [[New Economic Policy]]. However, while the Soviet government during the latter period encouraged some international trade, it also permitted and even encouraged&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30841557|title=The making of the Soviet system : essays in the social history of interwar Russia|last=1921-2010.|first=Lewin, Moshe,|date=1994|publisher=New Press|isbn=1565841255|location=New York|oclc=30841557}}&lt;/ref&gt; local autarkies in many peasant villages.

Right-wing totalitarian governments that have claimed to strive for autarky have often pursued a very different policy in fact, just as some claimed to be in favor of socialism while killing socialists. In 1921 Italian [[Italian Fascism|Fascists]] attacked existing left-wing autarkic projects at the behest of large landowners, destroying roughly 119 labor chambers, 107 cooperatives and 83 peasant offices that year alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42462895|title=Italian fascism : its origins &amp; development|last=De Grand|first= Alexander J.|year=2000|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803266227|edition= 3rd|location=Lincoln|pages=31–33|oclc=42462895}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazi Germany]] under economics minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]] claimed to strive for self-sufficiency but pursued major international trade, albeit under a different system, to escape the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The regime would continue to conduct trade, including with countries like the United States, including connections with major companies like [[IBM and the Holocaust|IBM]] and [[Fanta|Coca-Cola]].

===After World War II===
Economic self-sufficiency was pursued as a goal by some members of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], such as [[India]] under [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NAYAR|first=BALDEV RAJ|date=1997|title=Nationalist Planning for Autarky and State Hegemony : Development Strategy Under Nehru|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24010467|journal=Indian Economic Review|volume=32|issue=1|pages=13–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tanzania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malima|first=Kighoma A.|date=1979|title=PLANNING FOR SELF-RELIANCE TANZANIA'S THIRD FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24498250|journal=Africa Development / Afrique et Développement|volume=4|issue=1|pages=37–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the ideology of [[Ujamaa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1024254210|title=State Ideology and Language in Tanzania : Second and Revised Edition.|last=Jan.|first=Blommaert,|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780748668267|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford|oclc=1024254210}}&lt;/ref&gt; and swadeshi. hat was partly an effort to escape the economic domination of both the United States and the Soviet Union while modernizing the countries' infrastructure.

Small-scale autarkies were sometimes used by the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]], such as in the case of the [[Montgomery bus boycott|Montgomery Bus Boycott]], where boycotters set up their own self-sufficient system of cheap or free transit to allow black residents to get to work and avoid using the then-segregated public systems in a successful effort to bring political pressure.

After World War II, [[Autonomism|Autonomist efforts]] in Europe embraced autarkic projects in an effort to craft anti-authoritarian left-wing spaces, especially influencing the [[social center]] and [[squatting|squatters]]' rights movements. Such efforts remain a common feature of Autonomist and anarchist movements on the continent today. The Micropolis social centre in Greece, for example, has gyms, restaurants, bars, meeting space and free distribution of food and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/984595655|title=Antifa : the anti-fascist handbook|last=activist),|first=Bray, Mark (Political|isbn=1612197035|location=Brooklyn, NY|oclc=984595655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1970, the [[Black Panther Party]] moved away from communist internationalism towards "intercommunalism," a term coined&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libcom.org/library/huey-newton-introduces-revolutionary-intercommunalism-boston-college-november-18-1970|title=Huey Newton introduces Revolutionary Intercommunalism, Boston College, November 18 1970|website=libcom.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Huey P. Newton]], "to retain a grasp on the local when the rest of radical thought seemed to be moving global." Intercommunalism drew&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thenewinquiry.com/the-havoc-of-less/|title=The Havoc of Less|date=2017-09-15|work=The New Inquiry|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206132434/https://thenewinquiry.com/the-havoc-of-less/|archivedate=2018-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from left-wing autarkic projects like free medical clinics and breakfast programs, "explicitly articulated as attempts to fill a void left by the failure of the federal government to provide resources as basic as food to black communities."

Autarkic efforts to counter forcible privatization of public resources and maintain local self-sufficiency also formed a key part of [[alter-globalization]] efforts. The [[Cochabamba Water War]] had Bolivians successfully oppose the privatization of their water system to keep the resource in public hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56194844|title=Cochabamba!: Water War in Bolivia|last=Oscar.|first=Olivera,|date=2004|publisher=South End Press|others=Lewis, Tom, |isbn=9780896087026|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=56194844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
Today, national economic autarkies are relatively rare. A commonly-cited example is [[North Korea]], based on the government ideology of [[Juche]] ([[self-sufficiency]]), which is concerned with maintaining its domestic localized economy in the face of its isolation. However, even North Korea has extensive trade with [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Syria]], [[Iran]], [[Vietnam]], and many countries in Europe and Africa. North Korea had to import food during a widespread [[North Korean famine|famine in the 1990s]].

A better modern example at a societal level is the autonomous region of [[Rojava]], the autonomous northern region of [[Syria]]. Cut off from international trade, facing multiple enemies, and striving for a society based on democratic confederalism and the ideals of [[Murray Bookchin]], Rojava's government and constitution emphasize economic self-sufficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A small key can open a large door: the Rojava revolution|editor=Strangers In A Tangled Wilderness|isbn=193866017X|location=United States|oclc=900796070}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by neighborhood and village councils, with property and business belonging to those who live in or use it towards that goal.

An example of an contemporary effort at localized autarky, incorporating the concept's history from [[black nationalism]], Ujamaa and [[African-American socialism]] and the civil rights movement, is Cooperation Jackson,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cooperationjackson.org/|title=Welcome|website=Cooperation Jackson|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a movement aimed at creating a self-sufficient black working class economy in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. The movement has aimed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/976416348|title=Jackson rising : the struggle for economic recovery and black self-determination in Jackson, Mississippi|others=Nangwaya, Ajamu,, Cooperation Jackson,|isbn=9780995347458|location=Montreal, Quebec|oclc=976416348}}&lt;/ref&gt; to secure land and build self-sufficient cooperatives and workplaces "to democratically transform the political economy of the city" and push back against gentrification. Cooperation Jackson also saw a gain in electoral political power when its involvement proved pivotal to the 2013 mayoral election of [[Chokwe Lumumba]] and the 2017 election of his son, [[Chokwe Antar Lumumba]].

'''Backwardness''' is a lack of progress by a person or group to some perceived cultural norm of advancement, such as for example traditional societies relative to modern scientific and technologically advanced industrialized societies.
{{TOC right}}

== Gerschenkron's Model ==
The Backwardness Model is a theory of [[economic growth]] created by [[Alexander Gerschenkron]]. The model postulates that the more backward an economy is at the outset of economic development, the more likely certain conditions are to occur:

*Special institutions, including banks or the state, will be necessary to properly channel [[physical capital]] and [[human capital]] to industries.
*There will be an emphasis on the production of producer goods rather than consumer goods.
*There will be an emphasis on capital-intensive production rather than labor-intensive production.
*There will be a great scale of production and enterprise.
*There will be a reliance on borrowed rather than local technologies.
*The role of the agricultural sector, as a market for new industries, will be small.
*There will be a reliance on productivity growth.

The backwardness model is often contrasted with the [[Rostovian take-off model]] developed by [[W.W. Rostow]], which presents a more linear and structuralist model of economic growth, planning it out in defined stages. The two models are not mutually exclusive, however, and many countries appear to follow both models rather adequately.

== Veblen ==

[[Thorstein Veblen]]'s 1915 ''Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution'' is an extended essay comparing the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/veblen/ImperialGermany.pdf Full text at [[McMaster University]]]&lt;/ref&gt; and concluding that the slowing of growth in Britain and the rapid advances in Germany were due to the "penalty of taking the lead".

British industry worked out, in a context of small competing firms, the best ways to produce efficiently. Germany's backwardness gave it an advantage in that the best practice could be adopted in large-scale firms.

{{Criminal law}}
'''Battery''' is a criminal [[Offence (law)|offense]] involving the unlawful physical acting upon a threat, distinct from [[assault]] which is the act of creating apprehension of such contact.

Battery is a specific [[common law]] misdemeanor, although the term is used more generally to refer to any unlawful offensive physical contact with another person, and may be a [[misdemeanor]] or a felony, depending on the circumstances. Battery was defined at common law as "any unlawful and or unwanted touching of the person of another by the aggressor, or by a substance put in motion by him."&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{Citation

 | accessdate = 2009-08-01
|pages=117–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, battery is now governed by [[statute]]s, and its severity is determined by the law of the specific jurisdiction.

== Generally ==
Specific rules regarding battery vary among different jurisdictions, but some elements remain constant across jurisdictions. Battery generally requires that:

# an offensive touch or contact is made upon the victim, instigated by the actor; and
# the actor intends or knows that their action will cause the offensive touching.

Under the US [[Model Penal Code]] and in some jurisdictions, there is battery when the actor acts recklessly without specific intent of causing an offensive contact. Battery is typically classified as either simple or aggravated. Although battery typically occurs in the context of physical altercations, it may also occur under other circumstances, such as in medical cases where a doctor performs a non-consented medical procedure.

== Specific countries ==
=== Canada ===

Battery is not defined in the Canadian Criminal Code. Instead, the Code has an  offense of assault, and assault causing bodily harm.

=== England and Wales ===
Battery is a [[common law]] offence within England and Wales.

As with the majority of offences in the UK, it has two elements:
* [[Actus Reus]]: The defendant unlawfully touched or applied force to the victim
* [[Mens Rea]]: The defendant [[Intention (criminal law)|intended]] or was [[Recklessness (law)|reckless]] as to the unlawful touch or application of force

This offence is a crime against autonomy, with more violent crimes such as [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|ABH]] and [[Grievous bodily harm|GBH]] being punishable under the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]].

As such, even the slightest of touches can amount to an unlawful application of force. However, it is assumed that everyday encounters (such as making contact with others on public transportation) are consented to and not punishable.&lt;ref&gt;Collins v Wilcock [1984] 3 ALL ER 374 (QBD)&lt;/ref&gt;

Much confusion can come between the terms 'assault' and 'battery'. While in everyday use the term assault may be used to describe a physical attack, this is indeed a battery. An assault is causing someone to apprehend that you will commit a battery. This issue is so prevalent that the crime of sexual assault&lt;ref&gt;Sexual Offences Act 2003, Section 3 &lt;www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/3&gt; accessed 10 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; would be better labelled a sexual battery. This confusion stems from the fact that both assault and battery can be referred to as common assault.

There is no separate offence for a battery relating to domestic violence, however the introduction of the crime of "controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship" in [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/9/section/76/enacted Section 76] of the [[Serious Crime Act 2015]], has given rise to new sentencing guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overarching Principles: Domestic Abuse|url=https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/6.4143_SC_Domestic_Abuse_Paper_WEB.pdf |publisher=Sentencing Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; that take into account significant aggravating factors such as abuse of trust, resulting in potentially longer sentences for acts of battery within the context of domestic violence.

==== Whether it is a statutory offence ====

In DPP v. Taylor, DPP v. Little,&lt;ref&gt;DPP v. Taylor, DPP v. Little [1992] 1 QB 645, 95 Cr App R 28&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that battery is a statutory offence, contrary to [https://web.archive.org/web/20090907131325/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=2116678 section 39] of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]]. This decision was criticised in Haystead v. DPP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2000/181.html |title=Haystead v Chief Constable of Derbyshire [2000&amp;#93; EWHC QB 181 (12 May 2000) |publisher=Bailii.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the Divisional court expressed the ''[[obiter]]'' opinion that battery remains a common law offence.

Therefore, whilst it may be a better view that battery and assault have statutory penalties, rather than being statutory offences, it is still the case that until review by a higher court, DPP v Little is the preferred authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith &amp; Hogan|title=Criminal Law|year=2008|publisher=OUP|page=584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mode of trial and sentence ====

In England and Wales, it is a usually tried as a [[summary offence]] under section 39 of [[Criminal Justice Act 1988|The Criminal Justice Act 1988]]. However, where section 40 applies, it can be an additional charge on an [[indictment]].

It is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding [[Standard scale#United Kingdom|level 5]] on the [[standard scale]], or both.

See [http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/common_assult/ Crown Prosecution Service Sentencing Manual] for case law on sentencing.

=== Russia ===
There is an offence which could be (loosely) described as battery in Russia. Article 116&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultant.ru/popular/ukrf/10_24.html#p1236 |title=ПРЕСТУПЛЕНИЯ ПРОТИВ ЖИЗНИ И ЗДОРОВЬЯ - Уголовный кодекс РФ (УК РФ) от 13 June 1996 N 63-ФЗ \ Консультант Плюс |publisher=Consultant.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Russian Criminal Code]] provides that battery or similar violent actions which cause pain are an offence.

=== Scotland ===
There is no distinct offence of battery in [[Scotland]]. The offence of [[Assault#Scotland|assault]] includes acts that could be described as battery.

=== United States ===
In the United States, '''criminal battery''', or simple battery, is the use of force against another, resulting in harmful or offensive contact, including sexual contact.&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]] Garner, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[common law]], simple battery is a misdemeanor. The [[prosecutor]] must prove all three elements beyond a reasonable doubt:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What are the Crimes of Assault and Battery|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/assault-and-battery|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# an unlawful application of force
# to the person of another
# resulting in either bodily injury or an offensive touching.

The common-law elements serve as a basic template, but individual jurisdictions may alter them, and they may vary slightly from state to state. 

Under modern statutory schemes, battery is often divided into grades that determine the severity of punishment. For example:
* '''Simple battery''' may include ''any'' form of non-consensual harmful or insulting contact, regardless of the injury caused.  Criminal battery requires ''intent'' to inflict an injury on another.
* '''Sexual battery''' may be defined as non-consensual touching of the intimate parts of another. At least in Florida, "Sexual battery means oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another or the anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object": See section 794.011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=794.011  Sexual Battery Unspecified|url=http://offender.fdle.state.fl.us/offender/QualifyingOffenses.jsp#1130|website=offender.fdle.state.fl.us/|publisher=Florida Department of Law Enforcement|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Family-violence battery''' may be limited in its scope between persons within a certain degree of relationship: statutes for this offense have been enacted in response to increasing awareness of the problem of [[domestic violence]].
* '''Aggravated battery''' generally is seen as a serious offense of [[felony]] grade. Aggravated battery charges may occur when a battery causes serious bodily injury or permanent disfigurement. As successor to the common law crime of [[Mayhem (crime)|mayhem]], this is sometimes subsumed in the definition of [[assault|aggravated assault]]. In Florida, Aggravated Battery is the ''intentional'' infliction of great bodily harm and is a second degree felony,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Statute on Aggravated Battery|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0784/Sections/0784.045.html|publisher=Florida Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas battery that ''unintentionally'' causes great bodily harm is considered a third degree felony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Statute on Felony Battery|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0784/Sections/0784.041.html|publisher=Florida Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Kansas ====

In the state of [[Kansas]] battery is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kansas Statutes, Sec. 21-5413. Battery; aggravated battery; battery against certain persons; aggravated battery against certain persons|url=http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2017_18/statute/021_000_0000_chapter/021_054_0000_article/021_054_0013_section/021_054_0013_k/|website=Kansas Legislature|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Battery.
:(a) Battery is:
:(1)   Intentionally or recklessly causing bodily harm to another person; or
:(2)   intentionally causing physical contact with another person when done in a rude, insulting or angry manner.

==== Louisiana ====

The law on battery in [[Louisiana]] reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SUBPART B. ASSAULT AND BATTERY  (WITH RELATED OFFENSES)|url=http://legis.la.gov/lss/lss.asp?doc=78437|website=legis.la.gov/|publisher=Louisiana State Legislature|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:§&amp;nbsp;33.  Battery defined
:Battery is the intentional use of force or violence upon the person of another; or the intentional administration of a poison or other noxious liquid or substance to another.

== Jurisdictional differences ==

In some jurisdictions, battery has recently been constructed to include directing bodily secretions (i.e., spitting) at another person without their permission. Some of those jurisdictions automatically elevate such a battery to the charge of aggravated battery. In some jurisdictions, the charge of criminal battery also requires evidence of a mental state (''[[mens rea]]''). The terminology used to refer to a particular offense can also vary by jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions, such as New York, refer to what, under the common law, would be battery as assault, and then use another term for the crime that would have been assault, such as menacing.

== Distinction between battery and assault ==

The [[Actus reus|overt behavior]] of an assault might be Person A advancing upon Person B by chasing after them and swinging a fist toward their head. The overt behavior of battery might be A actually striking B.

Battery requires (1) a volitional act that (2) results in a harmful or offensive contact with another person and (3) is committed for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact or under circumstances that render such contact substantially certain to occur or with a reckless disregard as to whether such contact will result. Assault is an attempted battery or the act of intentionally placing a person in apprehension of a harmful or offensive contact with their person.

In some places, assault is the threat of violence against another while aggravated assault is the threat with the clear and present ability and willingness to carry it out. Likewise, battery is undesired touching of another, while aggravated battery is touching of another with or without a tool or weapon with attempt to harm or restrain.

A '''behavior modification facility''' (or '''youth residential program''') is a residential educational and treatment institution enrolling adolescents who are perceived as displaying antisocial behavior, in an attempt to alter their conduct. As of 2008 there were about 650 nongovernmental, residential programs in the United States offering treatment services for adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Lon Woodbury, [http://www.strugglingteens.com/artman/publish/PanicButtonES_081023.shtml Are We Ready for the Panic Button Yet?], by Lon Woodbury, strugglingteens.com website, October 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some similar institutions are operated as components of governmental education or correctional systems.

==Methodologies used in such programs==
Practices and service quality in such program vary greatly. The [[behavior modification]] methodologies used vary, but a combination of positive and negative reinforcement is typically used.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, G., &amp; Pear, J. (2007). Behavior modification: What it is and how to do it (Eighth Edition). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Often these methods are delivered in a [[contingency management]] format such as a point system or level system.&lt;ref&gt;McKee, J.M. (1971). Contingency management in a correctional institution. Educational
Technology, 11(4), 51-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Such methodology has been found to be highly effective in the treatment of disruptive disorders (see meta-analysis of Chen &amp; Ma (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Chen &amp; Ma (2007) Effectiveness of treatments on disruptive disorders: A quantitative synthesis of single subject methods using the PEM approach.

Research showed that time out length was not a factor and suggestions were made to limit time out to five minute durations.&lt;ref name="McGuffin, P.W. 1991"/&gt;  A newer approach uses graduated sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, J.C.

Behavioral residential treatment became so popular in the 1970s and 1980s that a journal was formed called "Behavioral residential Treatment", which later changed its name to "Behavioral Intervention." Behavioral Intervention continues to be published today.

==History==
In the late 1960s, [[behavior modification]] or practice referred to as [[applied behavior analysis]] began to move rapidly into residential treatment facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, H.L., Filipczak, J., Bis, J., Cohen, J., Golddiamond, I. &amp; Larkin, P. (1968). Case II- Model: A contingency oriented twenty-four-hour learning environment in a juvenile correctional Institution.

Glasser (Ed.), Handbook of Criminology. Chicago: Rand McNally&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to redesign the behavioral architecture around delinquent teens to lessen chances of recidivism&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, H.L. June, 1964). Behavioral architecture. Architectural Association Journal. London,&lt;/ref&gt; and improve academics &lt;ref&gt;Tyler, V.O. &amp; Brown, G.D.(1968). Token reinforcement of academic performance with institutionalized delinquents. Journal of Educational Psychology, 59, 164-168.&lt;/ref&gt; Harold Cohen and James Filipczak (1971) published a book hailing the successes of such programs in doubling learning rates and reducing recidivism.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, H.L. &amp; Filipczak, J. (1971). A new learning environment. Jossey Bass&lt;/ref&gt; This book even contained an introduction from the leading behaviorist at the time, [[B.F. Skinner]] hailing the achievements. Independent analysis of multiple sites with thousands of adolescents found behavior modification to be more effective than treatment as usual, a therapeutic milieu, and as effective as more psychologically intense programs such as transactional analysis with better outcomes on behavioral measures;&lt;ref&gt;Jesness, C.F. (1975). Comparative effectiveness of behavior modification and transactional analysis programs for delinquents. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 43(6), 758-779.&lt;/ref&gt; however, these authors found that behavior modification was more prone to leading to poor relationships with the clients.&lt;ref&gt;Jesness, C.F. (1975). Comparative effectiveness of behavior modification and transactional analysis programs for delinquents. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 43(6),758-779.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time interest faded in Cohen's CASE project &lt;ref name="Rutherford, A. 2009"&gt;Rutherford, A. (2009). ''Beyond the Box: B. F. Skinner's Technology of behavior from laboratory to life, 1950s-1970s''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies found that in proper supervision of staff in behavior modification facilities could lead to greater use of punishment procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Bassett, J. E., &amp; Blanchard, E. B. (1977). "The effect of the absence of close supervision on the use of response cost in a prison token economy". Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 10, 375–380.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of [[Montrose Wolf]], Achievement place, the first Teaching Family Home became the prototype for behavioral programs.&lt;ref&gt;Philips, (1968). Achievement place: Token reinforcement procedures in a home style rehabilitation setting for pre-delinquent boys. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 1, 213-223.&lt;/ref&gt; Achievement place opened in 1967. Each home has from 6-8 boys in it with two "parents" trained in behavior modification principles. The [[token economy|token system]] for the program was divided into 3 levels.  Outcome studies have found that Achievement place and other teaching family homes reduce [[recidivism]] and increase pro-social behavior, as well as self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Braukenmann, C.J., Wolf, M.M.,  Kirgin- Ramp, K.A (1985). Follow up of group home youth into young adulthood (Progress Report, Grant MH20030).

Children and Youth Services Review, 3, 343-355&lt;/ref&gt; While initial research suggested the effects of the program only lasted for one year post discharge, recent review of the data suggests the program lasts longer in effect.&lt;ref&gt;Kingsley, D., (2006). The Teaching-Family Model and Post-Treatment Recidivism: A Critical Review of the Conventional Wisdom. ''International Journal of Behavioral and Consultation Therapy,2,'' 481- 496 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually,  [[behavior modification]] /[[applied behavior analysis]] within the penal system including residential facilities for delinquent youth lost popularity in the 1970s-1980s due to a large number of abuses (see Cautilli &amp; Weinberg (2007) &lt;ref&gt;Cautilli, J.D. &amp; Weinberg, M. (2007).  Editorial: To license or not to license? That is the question:  Or, if we make a profession, will they come? ''The Behavior Analyst Today 8 (1),'' 1-8 [http://www.baojournal.com Behavior Analyst Online]&lt;/ref&gt;), but recent trends in the increase in U.S. [[crime]] and recent focus on reduction of [[recidivism]] have given such programs a second look [https://archive.is/20041231155321/http://www.ftnys.org/juv.htm].&lt;ref&gt;Redding, R.E., “Characteristics of Effective Treatments and Interventions for Juvenile Offenders.” Juvenile Justice Fact Sheet, Institute of Law, Psychiatry &amp; Public Policy, University of Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lipsey, M., &amp; Wilson, D. (1998). Effective intervention for serious juvenile offenders: A synthesis of research. In R. Loeber &amp; D. Farrington(Eds.), ''Serious and Violent Juvenile Offenders''.

Behavioral Intervention, 23(1), 1-12&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford's (2009) review from interviews and archival materials documents the decline from  treatment of  behavior analysis with criminal justice populations.&lt;ref name="Rutherford, A. 2009"/&gt;

==Some model programs==

While [[Boot camp (correctional)|boot camp type programs]] have not been shown to be successful, largely because they represent punishment devoid of context (unlike in the military, where passing boot camp initiates one into the service),&lt;ref&gt;Daly, D. L. (1994). Do boot camps work? Caring, 10, 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt; programs such as teaching family homes based on the [[Teaching-Family Model]] have been extensively researched and show positive gains. Research shows that they can be used to reduce delinquency while adolescents are in the home and post release {see Kingsley (2006) &lt;ref&gt;Kingsley, D.E. (2006): The Teaching-Family Model and Post-Treatment Recidivism: A Critical Review of the Conventional Wisdom - IJBCT, 2.(4), 481-497.[http://www.baojournal.com International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy]&lt;/ref&gt;}. In general, these types of programs take a [[behavioral engineering]] approach to reducing problem behavior and building skills.

In general, behavior modification programs that are used in facilities or in the natural environment have the largest effect size and lead to an estimated 15% reduction in recidivism.&lt;ref&gt;TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS AND RECIDIVISM: ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAMMES APPLIED IN EUROPE Santiago Redondo Illescas, Julio Sánchez-Meca and Vicente Garrido Genovés

Increasingly behavior modification models based on the principles of [[applied behavior analysis]] are being developed to model and reduce delinquency&lt;ref&gt;Stumphauzer, J. S.(1985).

==Controversy==
This industry is not without controversy, however.  The U.S. Surgeon General (1999) discussed the need to clarify admission criteria to residential treatment programs.&lt;ref name="mentalhealth.samhsa.gov"&gt;[http://www.mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/features/surgeongeneralreport/chapter3/sec7.asp#treatment  U.S. Surgeon General (1999).

[[Disability rights]] organizations, such as the [[Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law]], oppose placement in such programs and call into question the appropriateness and efficacy of such group placements, the failure of such programs to address problems in the child’s home and community environment, the limited or no mental health services offered and substandard educational programs.

Bazelon promotes community-based services on the basis that it considers more effective and less costly than residential placement.&lt;ref name="Forest Grove Factsheet"&gt;[http://www.bazelon.org/pdf/ForestGrove_factsheet.pdf U.S. Supreme Court to Decide Forest Grove v.

One recent acknowledgement has been that long term care does not equate with better outcomes.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt;
To reduce the tendency for abuse, a strong push has occurred to certify or license behavior modifiers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bacb.com BACB]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107154817/http://www.bacb.com/ |date=January 7, 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or to have such practices limited to licensed psychologists.[http://forms.apa.org/practice/modelactlicensure/ModelActforReview.pdf]{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} In particular psychologists with behavioral training &lt;ref&gt;Hunter, R.D.

Often the practice of behavior modification in facilities comes into question (see recent interest in [[Judge Rotenberg Educational Center]], [[Aspen Education Group]] and the [[World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools]]). Often these types of restrictive issues are discussed as part of ethical and legal standards (see [[Professional practice of behavior analysis]]). Recent research has identified some best practices for use in such facilities&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt; In general policies in such facilities require the presence of a treatment team to ensure that abuses do not occur especially if facilities are attempting to use punishment programs.&lt;ref&gt;Spreat, S. &amp; Lipinski, D.P. (1986).A survey of state policies regarding the use of restrictive/aversive behavior modification procedures. Behavioral Intervention, 1(2), 137-152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
In the U.S. residential treatment programs are all monitored at the state level and many are JACHO accredited. States vary in requirements to open such centers. Due to the absence of regulation of these programs by the federal government and because many are not subject to state licensing or monitoring,&lt;ref name="FTC Urges Caution"&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/07/residentialfyi.shtm  Evaluating Private Residential Treatment Programs for Troubled Teens, FTC Urges Caution When Considering 'Boot Camps'], [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC Federal Trade Commission]], Retrieved May 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the Federal Trade Commission has issued a guide for parents considering such placement &lt;ref name="Facts for Consumers"&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/products/pro27.shtm Considering a Private Residential Treatment Program for a Troubled Teen? Questions for Parents and Guardians to Ask], [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC Federal Trade Commission]], Retrieved May 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizations===
Residential therapist who are behavior modifiers should join professional organizations and be professionally affiliated. Many organizations exist for behavior therapists around the world. The World Association for Behavior Analysis offers a certification in behavior therapy [https://web.archive.org/web/20110110222511/http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html] In the United States, the American Psychological Association's Division 25 is the division for [[behavior analysis]]. The Association for Contextual Behavior Therapy is another professional organization. ACBS is home to many clinicians with specific interest in third generation behavior therapy. The [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]] (formerly the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy) is for those with a more cognitive orientation. Internationally, most behavior therapists find a core intellectual home in the International [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] (ABA:I) [http://www.abainternational.org/].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2431">'''CONWIP''' ('''CONstant [[work in process]]''') are pull-oriented [[production control]] [[system]]s. Such systems can be classified as pull and push systems (Spearman et al. 1990&lt;ref&gt;Spearman, M., Woodruff, D. and Hopp, W. (1990) CONWIP: a pull alternative to kanban. International Journal of Production Research 28, 879-894&lt;/ref&gt;). In a [[Push-pull strategy|push system]], the production order is scheduled and the material is pushed into the [[production line]]. In a [[Push-pull strategy|pull system]], the start of each product assembly process is triggered by the completion of another at the end of production line. This pull-variant is known for its ease of implementation.

CONWIP is a kind of single-stage [[kanban]] system and is also a hybrid push-pull system. While Kanban systems maintain tighter control of system WIP through the individual cards at each workstation, CONWIP systems are easier to implement and adjust, since only one set of system cards is used to manage system WIP.&lt;ref&gt;Marek, Richard P. et al., Understanding the fundamentals of Kanban and CONWIP pull systems using simulation, Proceedings of the 2001 VCDFGter Simulation Conference [http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc01papers/122.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; CONWIP uses cards to control the number of [[Work in process|WIP]]s. For example, no part is allowed to enter the system without a card (authority). After a finished part is completed at the last [[workstation]], a card is transferred to the first workstation and a new part is pushed into the sequential process route. In their paper, Spearman et al. (1990) used a simulation to make a comparison among the CONWIP, kanban and push systems, and found that CONWIP systems can achieve a lower WIP level than kanban systems.

==Card control policy ==

In a CONWIP system, a card is shared by all kinds of products.  However, Duenyas (1994) proposed a dedicated card control policy in CONWIP and he stated that this policy could perform as a multiple chain closed queuing network.

{{Over-quotation|date=December 2015}}
In [[philosophy of science]] and [[philosophy of mind]], '''cognitive closure''' is the proposition that human minds are constitutionally incapable of solving certain perennial philosophical problems.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Marsh (ed.), ''Hayek in Mind: Hayek's Philosophical Psychology'', Emerald Group Publishing, 2011, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Flanagan]] calls this position '''anti-constructive naturalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; or the "[[new mysterianism]]" and the primary advocate of the hypothesis, [[Colin McGinn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Errol E | last = Harris | title = Reflections on the Problem of Consciousness | year = 2006 | page = 51 | quote = McGinn's stance, while he denies the possibility of ever understanding the causal connection, may be regarded as "naturalistic" in the sense that he does not reject the validity of neuro-physiological theory, and does not doubt that brain activity accompanies conscious states.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross Wilson (ed.), ''The Meaning of "Life" in Romantic Poetry and Poetics'', Routledge, 2009, p. 88: "[McGinn] calls his stance "transcendental naturalism..."&lt;/ref&gt; calls it '''transcendental naturalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; acknowledging the possibility that solutions may be an intelligent non-human of some kind. According to McGinn, such philosophical questions include the [[mind-body problem]], [[personal identity|identity of the self]], [[meaning (philosophy of language)|foundations of meaning]], [[free will]], and [[epistemology|knowledge]], both ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' and [[empiricism|empirical]].&lt;ref name = "McGinn1994"&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Philosophical Studies |volume=76 |year=1994 | pages =133–56 | doi=10.1007/bf00989821 |url= http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/courses/consciousness97/papers/ProblemOfPhilosophy.html |title= The Problem of Philosophy |first=Colin |last=McGinn | quote =it combines deep epistemic transcendence with the denial that what thus transcends is thereby non-natural.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colin McGinn==
{{quote|It cannot be simply taken for granted that the human reasoning faculty is naturally suited for answering philosophical questions: the questions and their subject matter are one thing; and rational faculty, as a human trait, is another. From the fact that it is the best faculty we have… for doing philosophy it does not follow that it is a remotely good or adequate faculty for that purpose.&lt;ref name = "lim"&gt;{{Citation | first = Colin | last = McGinn | title = Problems in Philosophy: The Limits of Inquiry | year = 1993 | page = 31 | quote = There is, I believe, a systematic pattern to philosophical disputation, in which the same kinds of unsatisfying alternatives recur}}.&lt;/ref&gt; |Colin McGinn|''Problems in Philosophy: The Limits of Inquiry''}}
{{quote |When human minds interact with philosophical problems, especially those of the form 'How is X possible?', they are apt to go into one of four possible states. Either (i) they try to domesticate the object of puzzlement by providing a reductive or explanatory theory of it; or (ii) they declare it irreducible and hence not open to any levelling account; or (iii) they succumb to a magical story or image of what seems so puzzling; or (iv) they simply eliminate the source of trouble for fear of ontological embarrassment... The topics on which it imprints itself, and which I have discussed in some diagnostic detail in the aforementioned book, include: consciousness and the mind-body problem, the nature and identity of the self, the foundations of meaning, the possibility of free will, the availability of a priori and empirical knowledge...  Basically what we find, quite generally, is the threat of magic or elimination in the face of the theoretical obduracy of the phenomenon that invites philosophical attention. The phenomenon presents initial problems of possibility... Free will, for instance, looks upon early inspection to be impossible, so we try to find some conception of it that permits its existence, but this conception always turns out to be dubiously reductive and distorting, leaving us with the unpalatable options of magic, elimination or quietism... so we hop unhappily from one unsatisfactory option to the next; or dig our heels (squintingly) into a position that seems the least intellectually unconscionable of the bunch... Science, then, might be aptly characterised as that set of questions that does not attract [these] options – where our cognitive faculties allow us to form the necessary concepts and theories. The distinction between science and philosophy is, on this view, at root a reflection of the cognitive powers we happen to possess or lack, and is therefore creature-relative: it does not correspond to any interesting real division within objective reality... It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that our brains would have to be made of something other than neurons in order for us to have the kinds of cognitive powers needed to solve the problems philosophy poses; at any rate, this is the sort of diagnosis [transcendental naturalism] offers for our philosophical retardation... The hardness of philosophy is thus an upshot of the particular way that natural selection has built our thinking organ, not an objective trait of the subject-matter of philosophical questions.&lt;ref name ="McGinn1994" /&gt;|Colin McGinn|"Problems in Philosophy" in ''Philosophical Studies''}}

==Friedrich Hayek==
For [[Friedrich Hayek]], "The whole idea of the mind explaining itself is a logical contradiction"... and "takes this incompleteness—the constitutional inability of mind to explain itself—to be a generalized case of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]... Hayek is ''not'' a naturalistic agnostic, that is, the view that science ''currently'' cannot offer an explanation of the mind-body relationship, but in principle it could."&lt;ref name ="Butos2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=W.N. | last =Butos |year=2010 |title=The Social Science of Hayek's The Sensory Order | series = Advances in [[Austrian Economics]] | publisher =Emerald |isbn=978-1-84950975-6 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Uo4pjUvVmHEC&amp;pg=PA127 | pages = 127–28 | quote=1. ''Explanation'' is delimited by the apparatus of classification (the mind)... 2. An apparatus of classification cannot ''explain'' anything more complex than itself... 3. Therefore, the mind cannot fully ''explain'' itself...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==John Tyndall==
{{quote | [The] passage from the physics of the brain to the corresponding facts of consciousness is unthinkable. Granted that a definite thought, and a definite molecular action in the brain occur simultaneously; we do not possess the intellectual organ, nor apparently any rudiment of the organ, which would enable us to pass, by a process of reasoning, from the one to the other. They appear together, but we do not know why. Were our minds and senses so expanded, strengthened, and illuminated, as to enable us to see and feel the very molecules of the brain; were we capable of following all their motions, all their groupings, all their electric discharges, if such there be; and were we intimately acquainted with the corresponding states of thought and feeling, we should be as far as ever from the solution of the problem, "How are these physical processes connected with the facts of consciousness?" The chasm between the two classes of phenomena would still remain intellectually impassable. Let the consciousness of love, for example, be associated with a right-handed spiral motion of the molecules of the brain, and the consciousness of hate with a left-handed spiral motion. We should then know, when we love, that the motion is in one direction, and, when we hate, that the motion is in the other; but the "Why?" would remain as unanswerable as before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Tyndall | first = John | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hipQtHDerYQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=86#PPA86,M1 | title = Fragments of Science | date = 1871 | pages = 86–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|John Tyndall (1871)|''Fragments of Science''}}

==Noam Chomsky==
[[Noam Chomsky]] argues that the cognitive capabilities of all organisms are limited by biology and that certain problems may be beyond our understanding:
{{quote |A Martian scientist, with a mind different from ours might regard this problem [of free will] as trivial, and wonder why humans never seem to hit on the obvious way of solving it.  This observer might also be amazed at the ability of every human child to acquire language, something that seems to him incomprehensible, requiring divine intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Noam | last = Chomsky | title = Language and problems of knowledge | year = 1988 | page = 152}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|Noam Chomsky|''Language and problems of knowledge''}}

==Phenomena and noumena==
As argued in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', human thinking is unavoidably structured by [[categories of the understanding]]:
{{Quote | '''Quantity''' – Unity, Plurality, Totality.&lt;br&gt;
'''Quality''' – [[Reality]], Negation, Limitation.&lt;br&gt;
'''Relation''' – [[Inherence]] and Subsistence, [[Causality]] and Dependence, Community.&lt;br&gt;
'''Modality''' – [[Logical possibility|Possibility]] or Impossibility, [[Existence]] or Non-Existence, Necessity or Contingence.}}

These are ideas to which there is no escape, thus they pose a limit to thinking. What can be known through the categories is called [[phenomena]] and what is outside the categories is called [[noumena]], the unthinkable "things in themselves".

==New mysterians==
{{main|New mysterianism}}
In his (famous) essay "[[What Is It Like to Be a Bat?]]" [[Thomas Nagel]] mentions the possibility of cognitive closure to the [[subjective character of experience]] and the (deep) implications that it has for [[materialism|materialist]] [[reductionism|reductionist]] [[science]]. [[Owen Flanagan]] noted in his 1991 book ''Science of the Mind'' that some modern thinkers have suggested that consciousness will never be completely explained. Flanagan called them "the new mysterians" after the rock group [[Question Mark and the Mysterians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flanagan |first=Owen |authorlink=Owen Flanagan |title=The Science of the Mind |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |year=1991 |isbn=0-262-56056-9 |page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to McGinn, the solution to the [[mind-body problem]] cannot be grasped, despite the fact that the solution is "written in our genes".

[[Emergent materialism]] is a similar but different claim that humans are not smart enough to determine "the relationship between [[mind]] and matter."{{cn|date=November 2018}}{{dubious|date=November 2018}}

==Criticism==
While the nature of consciousness is complex, according to some philosophers, that does not imply closure, thus, McGinn's argument is flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garvey|first1=James|title=What Does McGinn Think We Cannot Know?|quote=Nothing he says gets him the conclusion that we cannot solve the mind-body problem, given any of these interpretations of what is cognitively closed to us|journal=Analysis|date=July 1997|volume=57|issue=3|pages=196–201|doi=10.1111/1467-8284.00074}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirk|first1=Robert|title=Why Shouldn't We Be Able to Solve the Mind-Body Problem?|quote=He recognizes that many will find this outrageous; and indeed I think that his reasoning is fundamentally flawed and his central thesis false.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40138">In [[ring theory]], a branch of [[abstract algebra]], a '''commutative ring''' is a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] in which the multiplication operation is [[commutative]]. The study of commutative rings is called [[commutative algebra]]. Complementarily, [[noncommutative algebra]] is the study of [[noncommutative ring]]s where multiplication is not required to be commutative.

{{Algebraic structures |Ring}}

==Definition and first examples==

===Definition===
{{details|topic=the definition of rings|Ring (mathematics)}}
A ''ring'' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''R'' equipped with two [[binary operation]]s, i.e. operations combining any two elements of the ring to a third. They are called ''addition'' and ''multiplication'' and commonly denoted by "+" and "⋅"; e.g. {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' ⋅ ''b''}}. To form a ring these two operations have to satisfy a number of properties: the ring has to be an [[abelian group]] under addition as well as a [[monoid]] under multiplication, where multiplication [[distributive law|distributes]] over addition; i.e., {{nowrap|1=''a'' ⋅ (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' ⋅ ''b'') + (''a'' ⋅ ''c'')}}. The identity elements for addition and multiplication are denoted 0 and 1, respectively.

If the multiplication is commutative, i.e.
:''a'' ⋅ ''b'' = ''b'' ⋅ ''a'',
then the ring ''R'' is called ''commutative''. In the remainder of this article, all rings will be commutative, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

===First examples===
An important example, and in some sense crucial, is the [[integer|ring of integer]]s '''Z''' with the two operations of addition and multiplication. As the multiplication of integers is a commutative operation, this is a commutative ring. It is usually denoted '''Z''' as an abbreviation of the [[German language|German]] word ''Zahlen'' (numbers).

A [[field (mathematics)|field]] is a commutative ring where &lt;math&gt; 0 \not = 1 &lt;/math&gt; and every [[0 (number)|non-zero]] element ''a'' is invertible; i.e., has a multiplicative inverse ''b'' such that ''a'' ⋅ ''b'' = 1. Therefore, by definition, any field is a commutative ring. The [[rational number|rational]], [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s form fields.

If ''R'' is a given commutative ring, then the set of all [[polynomial]]s in the variable ''X'' whose coefficients are in ''R'' forms the [[polynomial ring]], denoted ''R''[''X'']. The same holds true for several variables.

If ''V'' is some [[topological space]], for example a subset of some '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, real- or complex-valued [[continuous function]]s on ''V'' form a commutative ring. The same is true for [[differentiable function|differentiable]] or [[holomorphic function]]s, when the two concepts are defined, such as for ''V'' a [[complex manifold]].

==Divisibility==
In contrast to fields, where every nonzero element is multiplicatively invertible, the concept of [[divisibility (ring theory)|divisibility for rings]] is richer. An element ''a'' of ring ''R'' is called a [[unit (algebra)|unit]] if it possesses a multiplicative inverse. Another particular type of element is the [[zero divisor]]s, i.e. a non-zero element ''a'' such that there exists a non-zero element ''b'' of the ring such that ''ab = 0''. If ''R'' possesses no zero divisors, it is called an [[integral domain]] (or domain). An element ''a'' satisfying ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 for some positive integer ''n'' is called [[nilpotent element|nilpotent]].

===Localizations===
{{Main|Localization of a ring}}
The ''localization'' of a ring is a process in which some elements are rendered invertible, i.e. multiplicative inverses are added to the ring. Concretely, if ''S'' is a [[multiplicatively closed subset]] of ''R'' (i.e. whenever ''s'', ''t'' ∈ ''S'' then so is ''st'') then the ''localization'' of ''R'' at ''S'', or ''ring of fractions'' with denominators in ''S'', usually denoted ''S''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''R'' consists of symbols
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{r}{s}&lt;/math&gt; with ''r'' ∈ ''R'', ''s'' ∈ ''S''
subject to certain rules that mimic the cancellation familiar from rational numbers. Indeed, in this language '''Q''' is the localization of '''Z''' at all nonzero integers. This construction works for any integral domain ''R'' instead of '''Z'''. The localization (''R'' \ {0})&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''R'' is a field, called the [[quotient field]] of ''R''.

==Ideals and modules==
{{hatnote|In the following, R denotes a commutative ring.}}

Many of the following notions also exist for not necessarily commutative rings, but the definitions and properties are usually more complicated. For example, all ideals in a commutative ring are automatically [[two-sided ideal|two-sided]], which simplifies the situation considerably.

===Modules and ideals===
{{Main|Module (mathematics)|l1=Module}}
For a ring ''R'', an ''R''-''module'' ''M'' is like what a vector space is to a field. That is, elements in a module can be added; they can be multiplied by elements of ''R'' subject to the same axioms as for a vector space. The study of modules is significantly more involved than the one of vector spaces in [[linear algebra]], since several features of vector spaces fail for modules in general: modules need not be [[free module|free]], i.e., of the form
:&lt;math&gt;M= \bigoplus_{i \in I} R.&lt;/math&gt;
Even for free modules, the [[rank of a free module]] (i.e. the analog of the dimension of vector spaces) may not be well-defined. Finally, submodules of finitely generated modules need not be finitely generated (unless ''R'' is Noetherian, see [[#submodules of f g modules|below]]).

===Ideals===
{{Main|Ideal (ring theory)|l1=Ideal|Factor ring}}
''Ideals'' of a ring ''R'' are the [[submodule]]s of ''R'', i.e., the modules contained in ''R''. In more detail, an ideal ''I'' is a non-empty subset of ''R'' such that for all ''r'' in ''R'', ''i'' and ''j'' in ''I'', both ''ri'' and ''i'' + ''j'' are in ''I''. For various applications, understanding the ideals of a ring is of particular importance, but often one proceeds by studying modules in general.

Any ring has two ideals, namely the [[0 (number)|zero ideal]] {0} and ''R'', the whole ring. These two ideals are the only ones precisely if ''R'' is a field. Given any subset ''F'' = {''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''j'' ∈ ''J''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''R'' (where ''J'' is some index set), the ideal ''generated by F'' is the smallest ideal that contains ''F''. Equivalently, it is given by finite [[linear combination]]s
:''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Principal ideal domains====
If ''F'' consists of a single element ''r'', the ideal generated by ''F'' consists of the multiples of ''r'', i.e., the elements of the form ''rs'' for arbitrary elements ''s''. Such an ideal is called a [[principal ideal]]. If every ideal is a principal ideal, ''R'' is called a [[principal ideal ring]]; two important cases are '''Z''' and ''k''[''X''], the polynomial ring over a field ''k''. These two are in addition domains, so they are called [[principal ideal domain]]s.

Unlike for general rings, for a principal ideal domain, the properties of individual elements are strongly tied to the properties of the ring as a whole. For example, any principal ideal domain ''R'' is a [[unique factorization domain]] (UFD) which means that any element is a product of irreducible elements, in a (up to reordering of factors) unique way. Here, an element ''a'' in a domain is called [[irreducible element|irreducible]] if the only way of expressing it as a product
:''a'' = ''bc'',
is by either ''b'' or ''c'' being a unit. An example, important in [[Field (mathematics)|field theory]], are [[irreducible polynomial]]s, i.e., irreducible elements in ''k''[''X''], for a field ''k''. The fact that '''Z''' is a UFD can be stated more elementarily by saying that any natural number can be uniquely decomposed as product of powers of prime numbers. It is also known as the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].

An element ''a'' is a [[prime element]] if whenever ''a'' divides a product ''bc'', ''a'' divides ''b'' or ''c''. In a domain, being prime implies being irreducible. The converse is true in a unique factorization domain, but false in general.

====The factor ring====
The definition of ideals is such that "dividing" ''I'' "out" gives another ring, the ''factor ring'' ''R'' / ''I'': it is the set of [[coset]]s of ''I'' together with the operations
:(''a'' + ''I'') + (''b'' + ''I'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + I and (''a'' + ''I'')(''b'' + ''I'') = ''ab'' + ''I''.
For example, the ring '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' (also denoted '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''n'' is an integer, is the ring of integers modulo ''n''. It is the basis of [[modular arithmetic]].

An ideal is ''proper'' if it is strictly smaller than the whole ring. An ideal that is not strictly contained in any proper ideal is called [[maximal ideal|maximal]]. &lt;cite id=characterisation_of_maximal_ideals&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; An ideal ''m'' is maximal [[if and only if]] ''R'' / ''m'' is a field. &lt;cite id=existence_of_maximal_ideals&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; Except for the [[zero ring]], any ring (with identity) possesses at least one maximal ideal; this follows from [[Zorn's lemma]].

===Noetherian rings===
{{Main|Noetherian ring}}
A ring is called ''Noetherian'' (in honor of [[Emmy Noether]], who developed this concept) if every [[ascending chain condition|ascending chain of ideals]]
:0 ⊆ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  ... ⊆ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ...
becomes stationary, i.e. becomes constant beyond some index ''n''. Equivalently, any ideal is generated by finitely many elements, or, yet equivalent, &lt;cite id=submodules_of_f_g_modules&gt;[[submodule]]s of finitely generated modules are finitely generated&lt;/cite&gt;.

Being Noetherian is a highly important finiteness condition, and the condition is preserved under many operations that occur frequently in geometry. For example, if ''R'' is Noetherian, then so is the polynomial ring {{nowrap|''R''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} (by [[Hilbert's basis theorem]]), any localization ''S''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''R'', and also any factor ring ''R'' / ''I''.

Any non-noetherian ring ''R'' is the [[union (set theory)|union]] of its Noetherian subrings. This fact, known as [[Noetherian approximation]], allows the extension of certain theorems to non-Noetherian rings.

===Artinian rings===
A ring is called [[Artinian ring|Artinian]] (after [[Emil Artin]]), if every descending chain of ideals
:''R'' ⊇ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ⊇ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  ... ⊇ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊇ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊇ ...
becomes stationary eventually. Despite the two conditions appearing symmetric, Noetherian rings are much more general than Artinian rings. For example, '''Z''' is Noetherian, since every ideal can be generated by one element, but is not Artinian, as the chain
:'''Z''' ⊋ 2'''Z''' ⊋ 4'''Z''' ⊋ 8'''Z''' ⊋ ...
shows. In fact, by the [[Hopkins–Levitzki theorem]], every Artinian ring is Noetherian. More precisely, Artinian rings can be characterized as the Noetherian rings whose Krull dimension is zero.

==The spectrum of a commutative ring==

===Prime ideals===
{{Main|Prime ideal}}
As was mentioned above, '''Z''' is a [[unique factorization domain]]. This is not true for more general rings, as algebraists realized in the 19th century. For example, in
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z[\sqrt{-5}],&lt;/math&gt;
there are two genuinely distinct ways of writing 6 as a product:
:&lt;math&gt;6 = 2 \cdot 3 = (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5}).&lt;/math&gt;
Prime ideals, as opposed to prime elements, provide a way to circumvent this problem. A prime ideal is a proper (i.e., strictly contained in ''R'') ideal ''p'' such that, whenever the product ''ab'' of any two ring elements ''a'' and ''b'' is in ''p'', at least one of the two elements is already in ''p''. (The opposite conclusion holds for any ideal, by definition). Thus, if a prime ideal is principal, it is equivalently generated by a prime element. However, in rings such as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z[\sqrt{-5}]&lt;/math&gt;, prime ideals need not be principal. This limits the usage of prime elements in ring theory. A cornerstone of algebraic number theory is, however, the fact that in any [[Dedekind ring]] (which includes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z[\sqrt{-5}]&lt;/math&gt; and more generally the [[algebraic integers|ring of integers in a number field]]) any ideal (such as the one generated by 6) decomposes uniquely as a product of prime ideals.

Any maximal ideal is a prime ideal or, more briefly, is prime. Moreover, an ideal ''I'' is prime if and only if the factor ring ''R'' / ''I'' is an integral domain. Proving that an ideal is prime, or equivalently that a ring has no zero-divisors can be very difficult. Yet another way of expressing the same is to say that the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] ''R'' \ ''p'' is multiplicatively closed. The localisation (''R'' \ ''p'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''R'' is important enough to have its own notation: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. This ring has only one maximal ideal, namely ''pR''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. Such rings are called [[local ring|local]].

===The spectrum===
{{Main|Spectrum of a ring}}
[[Image:Spec Z.png|right|400px|thumb|Spec ('''Z''') contains a point for the zero ideal. The closure of this point is the entire space. The remaining points are the ones corresponding to ideals (''p''), where ''p'' is a prime number. These points are closed.]]
The ''spectrum of a ring R'',&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This notion can be related to the [[Spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] of a linear operator, see [[Spectrum of a C*-algebra]] and [[Gelfand representation]].&lt;/ref&gt;  denoted by Spec ''R'', is the set of all prime ideals of ''R''. It is equipped with a topology, the [[Zariski topology]], which reflects the algebraic properties of ''R'': a basis of open subsets is given by
:''D''(''f'') = {''p'' ∈ ''Spec R'', ''f'' ∉ ''p''}, where ''f'' is any ring element.
Interpreting ''f'' as a function that takes the value ''f'' mod ''p'' (i.e., the image of ''f'' in the residue field ''R''/''p''), this subset is the locus where ''f'' is non-zero. The spectrum also makes precise the intuition that localisation and factor rings are complementary: the natural maps ''R'' → ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R'' → ''R'' / ''fR'' correspond, after endowing the spectra of the rings in question with their Zariski topology, to complementary [[open immersion|open]] and [[closed immersion]]s respectively. Even for basic rings, such as illustrated for ''R'' = '''Z''' at the right, the Zariski topology is quite different from the one on the set of real numbers.

The spectrum contains the set of maximal ideals, which is occasionally denoted mSpec (''R''). For an [[algebraically closed field]] ''k'', mSpec (k[''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] / (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;)) is in bijection with the set
:{''x'' =(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∊ ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; | ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ... = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = 0.}
Thus, maximal ideals reflect the geometric properties of solution sets of polynomials, which is an initial motivation for the study of commutative rings. However, the consideration of non-maximal ideals as part of the geometric properties of a ring is useful for several reasons. For example, the minimal prime ideals (i.e., the ones not strictly containing smaller ones) correspond to the [[irreducible component]]s of Spec ''R''. For a Noetherian ring ''R'', Spec ''R'' has only finitely many irreducible components. This is a geometric restatement of [[primary decomposition]], according to which any ideal can be decomposed as a product of finitely many [[primary ideal]]s. This fact is the ultimate generalization of the decomposition into prime ideals in Dedekind rings.

===Affine schemes===
The notion of a spectrum is the common basis of commutative algebra and [[algebraic geometry]]. Algebraic geometry proceeds by endowing Spec ''R'' with a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt; (an entity that collects functions defined locally, i.e. on varying open subsets). The datum of the space and the sheaf is called an [[affine scheme]]. Given an affine scheme, the underlying ring ''R'' can be recovered as the [[global section]]s of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, this one-to-one correspondence between rings and affine schemes is also compatible with ring homomorphisms: any ''f'' : ''R'' → ''S'' gives rise to a [[continuous map]] in the opposite direction
:Spec ''S'' → Spec ''R'', ''q'' ↦ ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''q''), i.e. any prime ideal of ''S'' is mapped to its [[preimage]] under ''f'', which is a prime ideal of ''R''.
The resulting [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] of the two said categories aptly reflects algebraic properties of rings in a geometrical manner.

Similar to the fact that [[manifold (mathematics)|manifolds]] are locally given by open subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, affine schemes are local models for [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], which are the object of study in algebraic geometry. Therefore, several notions concerning commutative rings stem from geometric intuition.

===Dimension===
{{Main|Krull dimension}}
The ''Krull dimension'' (or dimension) dim ''R'' of a ring ''R'' measures the "size" of a ring by, roughly speaking, counting independent elements in ''R''. The dimension of algebras over a field ''k'' can be axiomatized by four properties:
* The dimension is a local property: dim ''R'' = sup&lt;sub&gt;p ∊ Spec ''R''&lt;/sub&gt; dim ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.
* The dimension is independent of nilpotent elements: if ''I'' ⊆ ''R'' is nilpotent then dim ''R'' = dim ''R'' / ''I''.
* The dimension remains constant under a finite extension: if ''S'' is an ''R''-algebra which is finitely generated as an ''R''-module, then dim ''S'' = dim ''R''.
* The dimension is calibrated by dim ''k''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] = ''n''. This axiom is motivated by regarding the polynomial ring in ''n'' variables as an algebraic analogue of [[affine space|''n''-dimensional space]].

The dimension is defined, for any ring ''R'', as the supremum of lengths ''n'' of chains of prime ideals
:''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ⊊ ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊊ ... ⊊ ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
For example, a field is zero-dimensional, since the only prime ideal is the zero ideal. The integers are one-dimensional, since chains are of the form (0) ⊊ (''p''), where ''p'' is a [[prime number]]. For non-Noetherian rings, and also non-local rings, the dimension may be infinite, but Noetherian local rings have finite dimension. Among the four axioms above, the first two are elementary consequences of the definition, whereas the remaining two hinge on important facts in [[commutative algebra]], the [[going-up theorem]] and [[Krull's principal ideal theorem]].

==Ring homomorphisms==
{{Main|Ring homomorphism}}
A ''ring homomorphism'' or, more colloquially, simply a ''map'', is a map ''f'' : ''R'' → ''S'' such that
:''f''(''a'' + ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') + ''f''(''b''), ''f''(''ab'') = ''f''(''a'')''f''(''b'') and ''f''(1) = 1.
These conditions ensure ''f''(0) = 0. Similarly as for other algebraic structures, a ring homomorphism is thus a map that is compatible with the structure of the algebraic objects in question. In such a situation ''S'' is also called an ''R''-algebra, by understanding that ''s'' in ''S'' may be multiplied by some ''r'' of ''R'', by setting
:''r'' · ''s'' := ''f''(''r'') · ''s''.

The ''kernel'' and ''image'' of ''f'' are defined by ker (''f'') = {''r'' ∈ ''R'', ''f''(''r'') = 0} and im (''f'') = ''f''(''R'') = {''f''(''r''), ''r'' ∈ ''R''}. The kernel is an [[ring ideal|ideal]] of ''R'', and the image is a [[subring]] of ''S''.

A ring homomorphism is called an isomorphism if it is bijective. An example of a ring isomorphism, known as the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z/n = \bigoplus_{i=0}^k \mathbf Z/p_i&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is a product of pairwise distinct [[prime number]]s.

Commutative rings, together with ring homomorphisms, form a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. The ring '''Z''' is the [[initial object]] in this category, which means that for any commutative ring ''R'', there is a unique ring homomorphism '''Z''' &amp;rarr; ''R''. By means of this map, an integer ''n'' can be regarded as an element of ''R''. For example, the [[binomial formula]]
:&lt;math&gt;(a+b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom n k a^k b^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;
which is valid for any two elements ''a'' and ''b'' in any commutative ring ''R'' is understood in this sense by interpreting the binomial coefficients as elements of ''R'' using this map.

[[File:Tensor product of algebras.png|thumb|The [[universal property]] of ''S'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ''T''
 states that for any two maps ''S'' &amp;rarr; ''W'' and ''T'' &amp;rarr; ''W'' which make the outer quadrangle commute, there is a unique map ''S'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ''T'' &amp;rarr; ''W'' which makes the entire diagram commute.]]
Given two ''R''-algebras ''S'' and ''T'', their [[tensor product of algebras|tensor product]]
:''S'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ''T''
is again a commutative ''R''-algebra. In some cases, the tensor product can serve to find a ''T''-algebra which relates to ''Z'' as ''S'' relates to ''R''. For example,
:''R''[''X''] ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ''T'' = ''T''[''X''].

===Finite generation===
An ''R''-algebra ''S'' is called [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated (as an algebra)]] if there are finitely many elements ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; such that any element of ''s'' is expressible as a polynomial in the ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Equivalently, ''S'' is isomorphic to
:''R''[''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] / ''I''.

A much stronger condition is that ''S'' is [[finitely generated module|finitely generated as an ''R''-module]], which means that any ''s'' can be expressed as a ''R''-linear combination of some finite set ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Local rings==
A ring is called [[local ring|local]] if it has only a single maximal ideal, denoted by ''m''. For any (not necessarily local) ring ''R'', the localization
:''R''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;
at a prime ideal ''p'' is local. This localization reflects the geometric properties of Spec ''R'' "around ''p''". Several notions and problems in commutative algebra can be reduced to the case when ''R'' is local, making local rings a particularly deeply studied class of rings. The [[residue field]] of ''R'' is defined as
:''k'' = ''R'' / ''m''.
Any ''R''-module ''M'' yields a ''k''-vector space given by ''M'' / ''mM''. [[Nakayama's lemma]] shows this passage is preserving important information: a finitely generated module ''M'' is zero if and only if ''M'' / ''mM'' is zero.

===Regular local rings===
[[File:Node_(algebraic_geometry).png|thumb|left|The [[cubic plane curve]] (red) defined by the equation ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'' + ''1'') is [[singularity (mathematics)|singular]] at the origin, i.e., the ring ''k''[''x'', ''y''] / ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'' + ''1''), is not a regular ring. The tangent cone (blue) is a union of two lines, which also reflects the singularity.]]
The ''k''-vector space ''m''/''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is an algebraic incarnation of the [[cotangent space]]. Informally, the elements of ''m'' can be thought of as functions which vanish at the point ''p'', whereas ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; contains the ones which vanish with order at least 2. For any Noetherian local ring ''R'', the inequality
:dim&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ''m''/''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ge; dim ''R''
holds true, reflecting the idea that the cotangent (or equivalently the tangent) space has at least the dimension of the space Spec ''R''. If equality holds true in this estimate, ''R'' is called a [[regular local ring]]. A Noetherian local ring is regular if and only if the ring (which is the ring of functions on the [[tangent cone]])
:&lt;math&gt;\bigoplus_n m^n / m^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
is isomorphic to a polynomial ring over ''k''. Broadly speaking, regular local rings are somewhat similar to polynomial rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Matsumura|loc=§7, Remarks, p. 143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular local rings are UFD's.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Matsumura|loc=§19, Theorem 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Discrete valuation ring]]s are equipped with a function which assign an integer to any element ''r''. This number, called the valuation of ''r'' can be informally thought of as a zero or pole order of ''r''. Discrete valuation rings are precisely the one-dimensional regular local rings. For example, the ring of germs of holomorphic functions on a [[Riemann surface]] is a discrete valuation ring.

===Complete intersections===
[[File:Twisted_cubic_curve.png|thumb|The [[twisted cubic]] (green) is a set-theoretic complete intersection, but not a complete intersection.]]
By [[Krull's principal ideal theorem]], a foundational result in the [[dimension theory (algebra)|dimension theory of rings]], the dimension of
:''R'' = ''k''[''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;] / (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)
is at least ''r'' &amp;minus; ''n''. A ring ''R'' is called a [[complete intersection ring]] if it can be presented in a way that attains this minimal bound. This notion is also mostly studied for local rings. Any regular local ring is a complete intersection ring, but not conversely.

A ring ''R'' is a ''set-theoretic'' complete intersection if the reduced ring associated to ''R'', i.e., the one obtained by dividing out all nilpotent elements, is a complete intersection. As of 2017, it is in general unknown, whether curves in three-dimensional space are set-theoretic complete intersections.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lyubeznik|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cohen–Macaulay rings===
The [[depth (ring theory)|depth]] of a local ring ''R'' is the number of elements in some (or, as can be shown, any) maximal regular sequence, i.e., a sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., 
''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; ''m'' such that all ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are non-zero divisors in
:''R'' / (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;).
For any local Noetherian ring, the inequality
:depth (''R'') &amp;le; dim (''R'')
holds. A local ring in which equality takes place is called a [[Cohen–Macaulay ring]]. Local complete intersection rings, and a fortiori, regular local rings are Cohen–Macaulay, but not conversely. Cohen–Macaulay combine desirable properties of regular rings (such as the property of being [[universally catenary ring]]s, which means that the (co)dimension of primes is well-behaved), but are also more robust under taking quotients than regular local rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Corollary 18.10, Proposition 18.13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructing commutative rings==
There are several ways to construct new rings out of given ones. The aim of such constructions is often to improve certain properties of the ring so as to make it more readily understandable. For example, an integral domain that is [[integrally closed]] in its [[field of fractions]] is called [[normal ring|normal]]. This is a desirable property, for example any normal one-dimensional ring is necessarily [[Regular local ring|regular]]. Rendering{{clarify|date=March 2012}} a ring normal is known as ''normalization''.

===Completions===
If ''I'' is an ideal in a commutative ring ''R'', the powers of ''I'' form [[neighborhood (topology)|topological neighborhoods]] of ''0'' which allow ''R'' to be viewed as a [[topological ring]]. This topology is called the [[I-adic topology|''I''-adic topology]]. ''R'' can then be completed with respect to this topology. Formally, the ''I''-adic completion is the [[inverse limit]] of the rings ''R''/''I&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''. For example, if ''k'' is a field, ''k''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, the [[formal power series]] ring in one variable over ''k'', is the ''I''-adic completion of ''k''[''X''] where ''I'' is the principal ideal generated by ''X''. This ring serves as an algebraic analogue of the disk. Analogously, the ring of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic integers]] is the completion of '''Z'''  with respect to the principal ideal (''p''). Any ring that is isomorphic to its own completion, is called [[complete ring|complete]].

Complete local rings satisfy [[Hensel's lemma]], which roughly speaking allows extending solutions (of various problems) over the residue field ''k'' to ''R''.

==Homological notions==
Several deeper aspects of commutative rings have been studied using methods from [[homological algebra]]. {{harvtxt|Hochster|2007}} lists some open questions in this area of active research.

===Projective modules and Ext functors===
Projective modules can be defined to be the [[direct summand]]s of free modules. If ''R'' is local, any finitely generated projective module is actually free, which gives content to an analogy between projective modules and [[vector bundle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Serre–Swan theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quillen–Suslin theorem]] asserts that any finitely generated projective module over ''k''[''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] (''k'' a field) is free, but in general these two concepts differ. 
A local Noetherian ring is regular if and only if its [[global dimension]] is finite, say ''n'', which means that any finitely generated ''R''-module has a [[resolution (homological algebra)|resolution]] by projective modules of length at most ''n''.

The proof of this and other related statements relies on the usage of homological methods, such as the
[[Ext functor]]. This functor is the [[derived functor]] of the functor
:Hom&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'', &amp;minus;).
The latter functor is exact if ''M'' is projective, but not otherwise: for a surjective map ''E'' &amp;rarr; ''F'' of ''R''-modules, a map ''M'' &amp;rarr; ''F'' need not extend to a map ''M'' &amp;rarr; ''E''. The higher Ext functors measure the non-exactness of the Hom-functor. The importance of this standard construction in homological algebra stems can be seen from the fact that a local Noetherian ring ''R'' with residue field ''k'' is regular if and only if
:Ext&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''k'', ''k'')
vanishes for all large enough ''n''. Moreover, the dimensions of these Ext-groups, known as [[Betti number]]s, grow polynomially in ''n'' if and only if ''R'' is a [[local complete intersection]] ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Christensen|Striuli|Veliche|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key argument in such considerations is the [[Koszul complex]], which provides an explicit free resolution of the residue field ''k'' of a local ring ''R'' in terms of a regular sequence.

===Flatness===
The [[tensor product]] is another non-exact functor relevant in the context of commutative rings: for a general ''R''-module ''M'', the functor
:''M'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus;
is only right exact. If it is exact, ''M'' is called [[flat module|flat]]. Despite being defined in terms of homological algebra, flatness has profound geometric implications. For example, if an ''R''-algebra ''S'' is flat, the dimensions of the fibers
:''S'' / ''pS'' = ''S'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ''R'' / ''p''
(for prime ideals ''p'' in ''R'') have the "expected" dimension, namely dim ''S'' &amp;minus; dim ''R'' + dim (''R'' / ''p'').

==Properties==
By [[Wedderburn's little theorem|Wedderburn's theorem]], every finite [[division ring]] is commutative, and therefore a [[finite field]]. Another condition ensuring commutativity of a ring, due to [[Nathan Jacobson|Jacobson]], is the following: for every element ''r'' of ''R'' there exists an integer {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 1}} such that {{nowrap|1=''r''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''r''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Jacobson|year = 1945|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; If, ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''r'' for every ''r'', the ring is called [[Boolean ring]]. More general conditions which guarantee commutativity of a ring are also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Pinter-Lucke|year = 2007|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==

===Graded-commutative rings===
[[File:Pair_of_pants.png|thumb|A [[pair of pants (mathematics)|pair of pants]] is a [[cobordism]] between a circle and two disjoint circles. Cobordism classes, with the [[cartesian product]] as multiplication and [[disjoint union]] as the sum, form the [[cobordism ring]].]]
A [[graded ring]] ''R'' = ⨁&lt;sub&gt;''i''∊'''Z'''&lt;/sub&gt; ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is called [[graded-commutative ring|graded-commutative]] if
:''ab'' = (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;deg ''a'' ⋅ deg ''b''.&lt;/sup&gt;
If the ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are connected by differentials ∂ such that an abstract form of the [[product rule]] holds, i.e.,
:∂(''ab'') = ∂(''a'')''b'' + (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;deg ''a''&lt;/sup&gt;∂(''b''),
''R'' is called a [[differential graded algebra|commutative differential graded algebra]] (cdga). An example is the complex of [[differential form]]s on a [[manifold (mathematics)|manifold]], with the multiplication given by the [[exterior product]], is a cdga. The cohomology of a cdga is a graded-commutative ring, sometimes referred to as the [[cohomology ring]]. A broad range examples of graded rings arises in this way. For example, the [[Lazard's universal ring|Lazard ring]] is the ring of cobordism classes of complex manifolds.

A graded-commutative ring with respect to a grading  by '''Z'''/2 (as opposed to '''Z''') is called a [[superalgebra]].

A related notion is an [[almost commutative ring]], which means that ''R'' is [[filtration|filtered]] in such a way that the associated graded ring
:gr ''R'' := ⨁ ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' / ⨁ ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;''R''
is commutative. An example is the [[Weyl algebra]] and more general rings of [[differential operator]]s.

===Simplicial commutative rings===
A [[simplicial commutative ring]] is a [[simplicial object]] in the category of commutative rings. They are building blocks for (connective) [[derived algebraic geometry]]. A closely related but more general notion is that of [[E-infinity ring|E&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-ring]].

==Applications==

===Simultaneous diagonalization of matrices===
The ring of [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] is ''not'' commutative, since [[matrix multiplication]] fails to be commutative.&lt;ref&gt;For example,
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; 1\\
 0 &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; 1\\
 1 &amp; 0\\
\end{bmatrix} &amp;=
\begin{bmatrix}
 2 &amp; 1\\
 1 &amp; 0\\
\end{bmatrix}\\
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; 1\\
 1 &amp; 0\\
\end{bmatrix}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; 1\\
 0 &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix} &amp;=
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; 2\\
 1 &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
However, any two matrices ''A'' and ''B'' that do commute can be [[simultaneous diagonalization|simultaneously diagonalized]], i.e., there is an invertible matrix ''P'' such that both ''PAP''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''PBP''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; are diagonal matrices. This fact makes representations of commutative [[Lie group]]s particularly simpler to understand than in general.

An example is the set of matrices of [[divided difference#Matrix form|divided differences]] with respect to a fixed set of nodes.

The '''Dehaene–Changeux model''' ('''DCM'''), also known as the '''global neuronal workspace''' or the '''global cognitive workspace model''' is a part of [[Bernard Baars]]'s "[[Global Workspace Theory|global workspace model]]" for consciousness.

It is a [[computer model]] of the [[neural correlates of consciousness]] programmed as a [[neural network]]. It attempts to reproduce the [[swarm behaviour]] {{clarify|date=November 2011}} of the [[brain]]'s ''higher cognitive functions'' such as [[consciousness]], [[decision-making]]&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP. '''Reward-dependent learning in neuronal networks for planning and decision making.''' Prog Brain Res. 2000;126:217-29.&lt;/ref&gt; and the central [[executive functions]]. It was developed by cognitive neuroscientists [[Stanislas Dehaene]] and [[Jean-Pierre Changeux]] beginning in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP. '''Experimental and theoretical approaches to conscious processing.''' Neuron. 2011 Apr 28;70(2):200-27.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to provide a predictive framework to the study of [[inattentional blindness]] and the solving of the [[Tower of London test]].&lt;ref&gt;Changeux JP, Dehaene S.

'''Neural networks that learn temporal sequences by selection.''' Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 May;84(9):2727-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Dehaene–Changeux model was initially established as a [[spin glass]] neural network attempting to represent [[learning]] and to then provide a stepping stone towards [[machine learning|artificial learning]] among other objectives. It would later be used to predict observable reaction times within the [[Priming (psychology)|priming paradigm]]&lt;ref&gt;Epub 2010 Jan 25. Van den Bussche E, Hughes G, Humbeeck NV, Reynvoet B '''The relation between consciousness and attention: an empirical study using the priming paradigm.''' Conscious Cogn. 2010 Mar;19(1):86–97..&lt;/ref&gt; and in inattentional blindness.

==Structure==

===General structure===
The Dehaene–Changeux model is a meta neural network (i.e. a network of neural networks) composed of a very large number of [[integrate-and-fire]] [[neuron]]s programmed in either a [[stochastic]] or deterministic way. The neurons are organised in complex [[Thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuits|thalamo-cortical columns]] with long-range connexions and a critical role {{clarify|date=November 2011}} played by the interaction between [[Constantin von Economo|von Economo's areas]]. Each thalamo-cortical column is composed of [[pyramidal cell]]s and [[Interneuron|inhibitory interneurons]] receiving a long-distance excitatory [[Neuromodulation (biology)|neuromodulation]] which could represent [[noradrenergic]] input.

===A swarm and a multi-agent system composed of neural networks===
{{Synthesis|section|date=November 2011}}
Among others Cohen &amp; Hudson (2002) had already used "''Meta neural networks as intelligent agents for diagnosis ''"&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, M.E.;  Hudson, D.L.;  Meta neural networks as intelligent agents for diagnosis Neural Networks, 2002. IJCNN '02. Proceedings of the 2002 International Joint Conference on 233 – 238&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Cohen &amp; Hudson, Dehaene &amp; Changeux have established their model as an interaction of meta-neural networks (thalamocortical columns) themselves programmed in the manner of a "''hierarchy of neural networks that together act as an intelligent agent''", in order to use them as a system composed of a large scale of inter-connected intelligent agents for predicting the self-organized behaviour of the neural correlates of consciousness. It may also be noted that Jain et al. (2002) had already clearly identified [[spiking neuron]]s as intelligent agents&lt;ref&gt;L. C. Jain, Zhengxin Chen, Nikhil Ichalkaranje Intelligent agents and their applications Volume 98 de Studies in fuzziness and soft computing&lt;/ref&gt; since the lower bound for computational power of networks of [[Artificial neuron|spiking neurons]] is the capacity to simulate in real-time for boolean-valued inputs any [[Turing machine]].&lt;ref&gt;Maas, W. Lower Bound for the computational power of networks of spking neurons [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.933]&lt;/ref&gt; The '''DCM''' being composed of a very large number of interacting sub-networks which are themselves intelligent agents, it is formally a [[Multi-agent system]] programmed as a [[Swarm]] or neural networks and ''a fortiori'' of spiking neurons.

The DCM exhibits several surcritical {{clarify|date=November 2011}} [[Emergence|emergent behaviors]] such as [[multistability]] and a [[Hopf bifurcation]] between two very different regimes which may represent either [[sleep]] or [[arousal]] with a various [[all-or-none]] behaviors which Dehaene et al. use to determine a testable taxonomy between different states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP, Naccache L, Sackur J, Sergent C. '''Conscious, preconscious, and subliminal processing: a testable taxonomy.''' Trends Cogn Sci. 2006 May;10(5):204-11. Epub 2006 Apr 17.&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|date=November 2011}}

==Scholarly reception==

===Self-organized criticality===
The Dehaene-Changeux Model contributed to the study of [[nonlinearity]] and [[self-organized criticality]] in particular as an explanatory model of the brain's emergent behaviors, including consciousness. Studying the brain's phase-locking and large-scale synchronization, Kitzbichler et al. (2011a) confirmed that criticality is a property of human brain functional network organization at all frequency intervals in the brain's physiological bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzbichler MG, Smith ML, Christensen SR, Bullmore E. '''Broadband criticality of human brain network synchronization.''' PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009 Mar;5(3):e1000314. Epub 2009 Mar 20. {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, exploring the neural dynamics of cognitive efforts after, ''inter alia'', the Dehaene-Changeux Model, Kitzbichler et al. (2011b) demonstrated how cognitive effort breaks the [[modularity of mind]] to make human brain functional networks transiently adopt a more efficient but less economical configuration.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzbichler MG, Henson RN, Smith ML, Nathan PJ, Bullmore ET. '''Cognitive effort drives workspace configuration of human brain functional networks.''' J Neurosci. 2011 Jun 1;31(22):8259-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Werner (2007a) used the Dehaene-Changeux Global Neuronal Workspace to defend the use of statistical physics approaches for exploring phase transitions, scaling and universality properties of the so-called "Dynamic Core" of the brain, with relevance to the macroscopic electrical activity in [[EEG]] and [[Electromyography|EMG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cogprints.org/5275/1/BrainDynamics.pdf Werner G. '''Brain dynamics across levels of organization.''' J Physiol Paris. 2007 Jul–Nov;101(4–6):273-9. Epub 2008 Jan 8.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, building from the Dehaene-Changeux Model, Werner (2007b) proposed that the application of the twin concepts of scaling and universality of the theory of non-equilibrium phase transitions can serve as an informative approach for elucidating the nature of underlying neural-mechanisms, with emphasis on the dynamics of recursively [[Reentry (neural circuitry)|reentrant]] activity flow in intracortical and cortico-subcortical neuronal loops. [[Karl Friston|Friston]] (2000) also claimed that "''the nonlinear nature of asynchronous coupling enables the rich, context-sensitive interactions that characterize real brain dynamics, suggesting that it plays a role in functional integration that may be as important as synchronous interactions''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1692735/pdf/10724457.pdf | pmc=1692735 | pmid=10724457 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0560 | volume=355 | title=The labile brain.

===States of consciousness and phenomenology===
It contributed to the study of phase transition in the brain under sedation, and notably GABA-ergic sedation such as that induced by propofol (Murphy et al. 2011, Stamatakis et al. 2010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coma.ulg.ac.be/papers/vs/murphy_propofol.pdf Murphy M, Bruno MA, Riedner BA, Boveroux P, Noirhomme Q, Landsness EC, Brichant JF, Phillips C, Massimini M, Laureys S, Tononi G, Boly M.Propofol '''anesthesia and sleep: a high-density EEG study.'''

A '''discharge''' is a type of sentence where no punishment is imposed, and which (by law in some Commonwealth realms, and arguably in others) vitiates the court's guilty verdict, thus resulting in a non-conviction. 

An '''absolute discharge''' is an unconditional discharge where the Court finds that a crime has technically been committed, but that any punishment of the defendant would be inappropriate, and the case is closed.  In some jurisdictions, an absolute discharge means there is no conviction on the defendant's record, despite the plea of the defendant.

A '''conditional discharge''' is an order made by a criminal court whereby an offender will not be sentenced for an offence unless a further offence is committed within a stated period. Once the stated period has elapsed and no further offence is committed then the conviction may be removed from the defendant's record.

==Australia==
In Australia, offenders can be discharged with or without being convicted, and with or without being placed on a good behaviour bond (or other conditions). These sentencing options vary from state to state. Note that defendants can be discharged without conviction even if they plead guilty to the alleged crime.

== Canada ==
In [[Canada]], a conditional discharge is a [[sentence (law)|sentence]] passed in criminal court in which an individual is found guilty of an offence but is deemed not to have been convicted. Although a discharge is not considered a conviction, a record of an absolute or conditional discharge is kept by [[Canadian Police Information Centre]] (CPIC) and by the charging police agency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/pub/C33.htm#cond |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231203343/http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/pub/C33.htm |archivedate=2011-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is purged from the individual's police record after a period of time: one year in the case of an absolute discharge, three years for a conditional one.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cr-cj/pp-er-eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Criminal Records Act]] states that, except in exceptional circumstances, if the discharge is conditional, no record may be disclosed after three years. While no conviction occurs, the offender is required to fulfill certain conditions as part of the sentence. The offender is put on [[probation]] for a period of up to three years. If the offender fails to meet the conditions of the probation, or commits another criminal offence during the probation period, they may be returned to court where the discharge is cancelled and receive a criminal conviction and sentence on the original offence, and for breach of probation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mpss.jus.gov.on.ca/english/corr_serv/comm_corr/probation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

If the conditions of the discharge are met it becomes an absolute discharge.

A court may grant a conditional or absolute discharge only for offences with no minimum penalty, and a maximum penalty of less than fourteen years.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, offenders can be "convicted and discharged" (gets a criminal record, but no other punishment) or "discharged without conviction" (no punishment and no criminal record). Note that defendants can be discharged without conviction even if they plead guilty to the alleged crime. This is usually done in cases where the negative impact of a conviction far outweigh the crime committed. For example, if a high-end businessman is caught in possession of a small quantity of [[marijuana]], due to the small nature of the crime compared to the effects a conviction (even without a sentence) would have, he may be discharged without conviction.

== United Kingdom ==

===England and Wales===
In [[England and Wales]], a conditional discharge is a sentence vitiating the finding of guilt, in which the offender receives no punishment provided that, in a period set by the court (not more than three years), no further offence is committed. If an offence is committed in that time, then the offender may also be re-sentenced for the offence for which a conditional discharge was given. Pursuant section 14 of the [[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/6/section/14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/00006--c.htm#14 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522020716/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2000/00006--c.htm |archivedate=2007-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and R v Patel [2006] EWCA Crim 2689&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2006/2689.html R v Patel (2006) EWCA Crim 2689 on Bailii]&lt;/ref&gt; the conditional discharge does not constitute a conviction unless the individual breaches the conditional discharge and is re-sentenced.

Absolute discharge is a lesser sentence imposed by a court, in which no penalty is imposed at all. Exceptionally, however, a court occasionally grants an absolute discharge for a very serious offence. (The signalman in the [[Thirsk rail crash (1892)|Thirsk rail crash]], who was found guilty of manslaughter, is an example of this.) This usually signifies that while a crime may technically have been committed, the imposition of any punishment would, in the opinion of the judge or magistrates, be inappropriate.

In both cases, the passing of a discharge does not prevent the court from ordering the defendant to pay compensation to a victim, to pay a contribution towards the prosecution's costs, or to be disqualified from driving. A court may grant a discharge only if it is "inexpedient to inflict punishment", and may not do so for certain firearms offences or [[Mandatory sentencing#Three strikes law|"three strikes"]] offenders. The law on discharges is set out in sections 12 to 15 of the [[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/00006--c.htm#12 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910033611/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/00006--c.htm |archivedate=2006-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, 9,734 offenders were given absolute discharges (0.7% of sentences) and 87,722 offenders were given conditional discharges (6% of sentences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discharges |url=http://sentencingcouncil.judiciary.gov.uk/sentencing/discharges.htm |publisher=Sentencing Council |accessdate=4 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928091207/http://sentencingcouncil.judiciary.gov.uk/sentencing/discharges.htm |archivedate=28 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===

In [[Scots law]], there is no conditional discharge similar to that in England and Wales, although [[admonition]] has a similar effect with a conviction recorded although there is no punishment. However, section 246 of the [[Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995]] provides that in dealing with cases other than where the sentence is fixed by law (e.g. murder)

*In cases on [[indictment]], if it appears to the court, having regard to the circumstances including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, that it is inexpedient to inflict punishment and that a probation order is not appropriate it may instead of sentencing him make an order discharging him absolutely.
*In summary cases, where the court is satisfied that the person committed the offence, and it is of the opinion, having regard to the circumstances including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, that it is inexpedient to inflict punishment and that a probation order is not appropriate may without proceeding to conviction make an order discharging him absolutely.

Section 247 further provides that an absolute discharge shall be deemed not to be a conviction for any purpose other than the purposes of the proceedings in which the order is made and of laying it before a court as a previous conviction in subsequent proceedings for another offence, and shall in any event be disregarded for the purposes of any enactment which imposes any disqualification or disability upon convicted persons, or authorises or requires the imposition of any such disqualification or disability. However, courts can consider previous absolute discharges in the same way as they consider previous convictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1995/ukpga_19950046_en_19#pt11-pb9-l1g246 Sections 246 and 247 of the 1995 Act] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625185149/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1995/ukpga_19950046_en_19#pt11-pb9-l1g246 |date=June 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

The concept of absolute or conditional discharge does not exist, as such, in United States law. However, different jurisdictions within the United States have a variety of analogues. The most direct is the [[suspended sentence]] or sentencing to "time served", meaning time spent in custody until sentencing. Many or most states also have alternative forms of adjudication for which a defendant may apply. These measures are typically available only to first offenders facing non-felony charges, and typically exclude certain types of charges, depending on the state. Such possibilities often include a guilty plea followed by a special form of probation, upon successful completion of which the public record of the case is sealed and the offender's criminal record expunged.

'''Dismemberment''' is the act of cutting, tearing, pulling, wrenching or otherwise removing the limbs of a living thing. It has been practised upon human beings as a form of capital punishment, especially in connection with [[regicide]], but can occur as a result of a traumatic accident, or in connection with murder, suicide, or cannibalism. As opposed to [[surgical]] [[amputation]] of the limbs, dismemberment is often fatal to all but the simplest of creatures. In [[criminology]], a distinction is made between offensive and defensive dismemberment.  Intentional, criminal dismemberment is known as ''mayhem''.

==History==

===Cut apart===
;Sliced to pieces by elephant
Particularly in South-Eastern Asia, [[Execution by elephant|execution by trained elephants]] was a form of capital punishment practiced for several centuries. The techniques by which the convicted person was actually executed varied widely but did, on occasion, include the elephant dismembering the victim by means of sharp blades attached to its feet. The Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], visiting Delhi in the 1330s, has left the following eyewitness account of this particular type of execution by elephants:&lt;ref&gt;Battuta, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ5CAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:The+intitle:travels+intitle:of+intitle:Ibn+intitle:Battuta&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8K36UOuaLImF4gTe4YDoAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The travels of Ibn Battuta]", transl. Lee, S, London 1829, pp. 146–47&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"Upon a certain day, when I myself was present, some men were brought out who had been accused of having attempted the life of the Vizier. They were ordered, accordingly, to be thrown to the elephants, which had been taught to cut their victims to pieces. Their hoofs were cased with sharp iron instruments, and the extremities of these were like knives. On such occasions the elephant-driver rode upon them: and, when a man was thrown to them, they would wrap the trunk about him and toss him up, then take him with the teeth and throw him between their fore feet upon the breast, and do just as the driver should bid them, and according to the orders of the Emperor. If the order was to cut him to pieces, the elephant would do so with his irons, and then throw the pieces among the assembled multitude: but if the order was to leave him, he would be left lying before the Emperor, until the skin should be taken off, and stuffed with hay, and the flesh given to the dogs."|sign=|source=}}
;Quartering procedure in the Holy Roman Empire
[[File:Tiradentes escuartejado (Tiradentes supliciado) by Pedro Américo 1893.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Tiradentes|Tiradentes Quartered]]'', [[Pedro Américo]] (1893)]]
In the [[Holy Roman Empire]] emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s 1532 [[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]] specifies how ''every'' dismemberment (quartering) should ideally occur:&lt;ref&gt;German original "Zu der Viertheylung: Durch seinen gantzen Leib zu vier stücken zu schnitten und zerhawen, und also zum todt gestrafft werden soll, und sollen solche viertheyl auff gemeyne vier wegstrassen offentlich gehangen und gesteckt werden"&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Concerning quartering: To cut and hack apart his entire body into four pieces, and thus be punished unto death, and such four parts are to be hanged on stakes publicly on four common thorough-fares."|sign=|source=}}
Thus, the imperially approved way to dismember the convict within the Holy Roman Empire was by means of ''cutting'', rather than dismemberment through ''ripping'' the individual apart. In paragraph 124 of the same code, beheading prior to quartering is mentioned as allowable when extenuating circumstances are present, whereas aggravating circumstances may allow pinching/ripping the criminal with glowing pincers, prior to quartering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Johann Christoph|title=Hals- oder peinliche Gerichtsordnung Kaiser Carls V. und des H.

The fate of [[Wilhelm von Grumbach]] in 1567, a maverick knight in the Holy Roman Empire who was fond of making his own private wars and was thus condemned for treason, is also worthy of note. Gout-ridden, he was carried to the execution site in a chair and bound fast to a table. The executioner then ripped out his heart, and stuck it in von Grumbach's face with the words: "von Grumbach! Behold your false heart!" Afterwards, the executioner quartered von Grumbach's body. His principal associate was given the same treatment, and an eyewitness avers (confirms)&lt;!--Note that this word "avers" is not a mistake; it means "affirms".--&gt; that ''after'' his heart had been ripped out, Chancellor Brück screamed horribly for "quite some time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ortloff|first=Friedrich|title=Geschichte der Grumbachischen Händel, Volume 4|publisher=Friedrich Frommann|year=1870|location=Jena|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qw9TAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA156|pages=156–158|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a highly aggravated execution is illustrated by the fate of Bastian Karnhars on 16 July 1600. Karnhars was found guilty of 52 separate acts of murder, including the rape and murder of 8 women, and the murder of a child, whose heart he had allegedly eaten for rituals of black magic. To begin, Karnhars had three strips of flesh torn from his back, before being pinched 18 times with glowing pincers, having his fingers clipped off one by one, his arms and legs [[broken on the wheel]], and finally, while still alive, quartered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Becherer|first=Johann|title=Neue Thüringische Chronica|publisher=Martin Spiess|year=1601|location=Müllhausen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fds-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA648|pages=648|accessdate=2013-03-24}} See also the 3-day long torture and execution method of [[Peter Niers]], who was executed in 1581 for 544 murders, including the murder of 24 women and their fetuses, the latter to be used in rituals of black magic.&lt;/ref&gt;
;A fabled Turkish execution method
In the seventeenth century, a number of travel reports speak of an exotic "Turkish" execution method, where first, the waist of a man was constricted by ropes and cords, and then a swift bisection of the trunk was performed. [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]] presents a comparatively prosaic description of the method:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lithgow|first=William|title=The Totall Discourse, of the Rare Aduentures, and Painefull Peregrinations of Long Nineteene Yeares Trauayles from Scotland, to the Most Famous Kingdomes in Europe, Asia, and Affrica|publisher=Nicholas Okes|year=1632|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=41oj3JOOUAwC&amp;pg=PA153|pages=153|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"If a Turke should happen to kill another Turke (...) he is brought forth to the market place, and a blocke being brought hither of foure foote high; the malefactor is stripd naked; and then layd thereupon with his belly downeward, they drawe in his middle together so small with running cords, that they strike his body a two with one blow: his hinder parts they cast to be eaten by hungry dogges kept for the same purpose; and the forequarters and head they throw into a grievous fire, made there for the same end .-and this is the punishment for man-slaughter."|sign=|source=}}
[[George Sandys]], however, during the same period, tells of a method as no longer in use, in a rather more mythologized way:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandys|first=George|title=A Relation of a Journey Begun an Dom. 1610.

{{quote|"...they twitch the offender about the waist with a towell, enforcing him to draw up his breath by often pricking him in the body, until they have drawn him within the compasse of a span; then tying it hard, they cut him off in the middle, and setting the body on a hot plate of copper, which seareth the veines, they so up-propping him during their cruell pleasure: who not only retaineth his sense, but the faculties of discourse, until he be taken downe; and then he departeth in an instant."|sign=|source=}}
;Shekkeh in Persia
In 1850s Persia, a particular dismemberment technique called ''shekkeh'' is reported to have been used. Travelling as an official for the [[East India Company]] Robert Binning&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docs.is.ed.ac.uk/docs/lib-archive/bgallery/Gallery/records/eighteen/binning.html Robert B.M.

When the shekkeh is to be inflicted in a merciful manner, the culprit's head is struck off, previous to bisecting the trunk."|sign=|source=}}

;Korea
Dismemberment was a form of capital punishment for convicts of [[high treason]] in the Korean kingdom of the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. This punishment was, for example, meted out to Hwang Sa-Yong in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jai-Keun|first=Choi|pages=135|title=The Origin of the Roman Catholic Church in Korea: An Examination of Popular and Governmental Responses to Catholic Missions in the Late Chosôn Dynasty|publisher=The Hermit Kingdom Press|year=2006|location=Norwalk, California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sydu4aOL-WoC&amp;pg=PA135|isbn=9781596890640|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;China
[[The Five Pains]] is a Chinese variation invented during the [[Qin dynasty]]. During the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907 CE), [[Waist chop|truncation of the body at the waist]] by means of a fodder knife was a death penalty reserved for those who were seen to have done something particularly treacherous or repugnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benn|first=Charles D.|title=China's Golden Age: Everyday Life in the Tang Dynasty|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|location=Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ile3jSveb4sC&amp;pg=PA210|page=210|isbn=9780195176650|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; That practice of cutting in two did not originate in the Tang dynasty; in sources concerning the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE-220 CE), no less than 33 cases of execution by cutting at the waist are mentioned, but occurs very rarely in earlier material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[http://www.zo.uni-heidelberg.de/md/zo/sino/institute/staff/kampen/eacs_scholar_hulsewe.pdf Hulsewé]|first=Anthony François Paulus|title=Remnants of Chʻin Law: An Annotated Translation of the Chʻin Legal and Administrative Rules of the 3rd Century B.C.

;Current use
Dismemberment is no longer used by most modern governments as a form of execution or [[torture]], though [[amputation#As a punishment in Islam|amputation]] is still carried out in countries that practice [[Sharia law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1371270.php/Saudi_Arabia_chops_off_hand_of_Egyptian_for_theft Saudi Arabia chops off hand of Egyptian for theft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811044139/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1371270.php/Saudi_Arabia_chops_off_hand_of_Egyptian_for_theft |date=11 August 2010 }}, 5 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torn apart===
Dismemberment was carried out in the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[Early Modern era]] and could be effected, for example, by tying a person's limbs to chains or other restraints, then attaching the restraints to separate movable entities (e.g. vehicles) and moving them in opposite directions.

====Torn apart by four horses====
Also referred to as "disruption" or being "drawn and quartered", dismemberment could be brought about by chaining four horses to the condemned's arms and legs, thus making them pull him apart, as was the case with the executions of [[François Ravaillac]] in 1610 and [[Robert-François Damiens]] in 1757. Ravaillac's extended torture and execution has been described like this:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tapié|first=Victor L.|title=France in the Age of Louis Xiii and Richelieu|publisher=CUP Archive|year=1984|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPM3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA62|pages=62–63|isbn=9780521269247|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"He was condemned to be tortured with red-hot pincers on four limbs and on each breast. His wounds were to be sprinkled with molten lead and boiling oil and his body was then to be torn in pieces by four horses, the remains being subsequently burnt."}} 
In the case of Damiens, he was condemned to essentially the same fate as Ravaillac, but the execution did not quite work according to plan, as the eyewitness [[Giacomo Casanova]] could relate:&lt;ref&gt;Described in {{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Irene|title=The A to Z of Punishment and Torture|publisher=Book Guild Publishing|year=2008|location=Brighton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TE2KfBWPAt0C&amp;pg=PA103|pages=103–104|isbn=9781846242038|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Damiens' agony went on for hours as each torture was applied. When the horses failed to disconnect the sinews between his body and his limbs, his body, still alive, was quartered with a knife. His friend, the infamous Casanova, reports that he "watched the dreadful sight for four hours." "I was obliged to turn away my face and to stop my ears as I heard his piercing shrieks, half his body having been torn from him."|sign=|source=}} 
[[Image:Tupac amaru execution.jpg|235px|thumb|The execution of [[Túpac Amaru II]], who was dismembered by four horses 18 May 1781.]]
As late as in 1781, this gruesome punishment was meted out to the [[Peruvian people|Peruvian]] rebel leader [[Túpac Amaru II]] by the Spanish colonial authorities. The following is an extract from the official judicial death sentence issued by the Spanish authorities which condemns Túpac Amaru II to torture and death. It was ordered in the sentence that Túpac Amaru II be condemned to have his tongue cut out, after watching the executions of his family, and to have his hands and feet tied...  
{{quote|...to four horses who will then be driven at once toward the four corners of the plaza, pulling the arms and legs from his body.

====The fate of Queen Brunhilda====
[[File:Brunhilda.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Execution of Brunhilda, engraving by Paul Girardet after [[Henri Félix Emmanuel Philippoteaux]]]]
Queen [[Brunhilda of Austrasia]], executed in 613, is generally regarded to have suffered the same death, though one account has it that she was tied to the tail of a single horse and thus suffered more of a [[dragging death]]. The [[Liber Historiae Francorum]], an eighth century chronicle, describes her death by dismemberment as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{cite book|last=Bitel|first=Lisa M.|title=Women in Early Medieval Europe, 400–1100|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|location=Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRudk_NcA7cC&amp;pg=PA83|pages=83|isbn=9780521597739|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Then King [[Chlothar II|Chlothar]] ordered that she be lifted onto a camel and led through the entire army. Then she was tied to the feet of wild horses and torn apart limb from limb. Finally, she died."|sign=|source=}}
The story of Brunhilda being tied to the tail of a ''single'' horse (and then to die in some gruesome manner) is promoted, for example, by Ted Byfield (2003), in which he writes: "Then they tied her to the tail of a wild horse; whipped into frenzy, it kicked her to death"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byfield|first=Ted|title=Darkness Descends : A.D. 350 to 565, the Fall of the Western Roman Empire|publisher=Christian History Project|year=2003|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZA4wyCSfUAC&amp;pg=PA223|pages=223|isbn=9780968987339|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cited source for this claim, however, the seventh century "Life of St. Columban" by the monk Jonas, does not support this claim. In paragraph 58 in his work, Jonas just writes: "..but Brunhilda he had placed first on a camel in mockery and so exhibited to all her enemies round about then she was bound to the tails of wild horses and thus perished wretchedly"&lt;ref&gt;Internet History Sourcebooks,[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/columban.asp Medieval Sourcebook: The Life of St. Columban, by the Monk Jonas, (7th Century)], paragraph 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The storyline of Brunhilde being tied to the tail of a single horse and being subsequently ''dragged'' to death has become a classical motif in artistic representations, as can be seen by the included image.

====Torn apart by four ships====
According to [[Olfert Dapper]], a 17th-century Dutchman who meticulously collected reports from faraway countries from seamen and other travelers, a fairly frequent maritime death penalty among the corsairs on the Barbary coast was to affix the hands and feet to chains on four different ships. When the ships then sailed off in different directions, the chains grew taut, and the man in between was torn apart after a while.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|last=Dapper|first=Olfert|title=Umbstaendliche und eigentliche Beschreibung von Africa|year=1670|publisher=J. von Meurs|location=Amsterdam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oBs-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA167|pages=167|accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Torn apart by two trees====
Roman military discipline could be extremely severe, and the emperor [[Aurelian]] (r. 270–275 CE), who had a reputation for extreme strictness, instituted the rule that soldiers who seduced the wives of their hosts should have their legs fastened to two bent-down trees, which were then released, ripping the man in two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sabin|first1=Philip|last2=van Wees|first2=Hans|last3=Whitby|first3=Michael|title=The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare: Volume 2, Rome from the Late Republic to the Late Empire|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|location=Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4aX-W6AVNv8C&amp;pg=PA439|pages=439|isbn=9780521782746|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in an unsuccessful rebellion against the emperor [[Valens]] in 366 CE, the usurper [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] met the same fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mariev|first=Sergei|title=Ioannis Antiocheni fragmenta quae supersunt omnia|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2008|location=Berlin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qY065QbJL7MC&amp;pg=PA374|pages=374–375|isbn=9783110210316|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat of [[Darius III]] by [[Alexander the Great]], the Persian monarchy was thrown into turmoil, and Darius was killed. One man, [[Bessus]], claimed the throne as Artaxerxes V, but in 329 BCE, Alexander had him executed. The manner of Bessus' death is rather disputed, and Waldemar Heckel writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heckel|first=Waldemar|title=The Conquests of Alexander the Great|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|location=Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Chu5MBz1gbQC&amp;pg=PA95|pages=95|isbn= 9781107645394|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The exact details of Bessus' death are disputed. He may have been crucified, or torn apart by recoiling trees, or (what is most likely) mutilated before being sent to [[Ecbatana]] for execution.}}
The method of tying people to bent down trees, which are then allowed to recoil, ripping the individual to pieces in the process is, however, mentioned by several travelers to nineteenth century Persia. The British diplomat [[James Justinian Morier]] travelled as a special envoy to the Shah in 1808, and Morier writes the following concerning then prevailing criminal justice:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morier|first=James Justinian|title=A Journey Through Persia, Armenia and Asia Minor, to Constantinople, in the Years 1808 and 1809|publisher=Longman Hurst|year=1812|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KM-Tdt38mAoC&amp;pg=PA204|pages=204|isbn= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|..for the King never pardons theft, and orders a convicted thief to be executed instantly. The mode is as follows: two young trees are by main strength brought together at their summits, and there fastened with cords together. The culprit is then brought out, and his legs are tied with ropes, which are again carried up and: fixed to the top of the trees. The cords that force the trees together are then cut; and, in the elasticity and power of this spring, the body of the thief is torn asunder, and left thus to hang divided on each separate tree. The inflexibility of the King in this point has given to the roads a security, which, in former times, was little known.}}

An obscure Christian martyr, Severianus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienS/Secundus_Carpophorus_Victorinus_Severianus.html Secundus, Carpophorus, Victorinus und Severianus]&lt;/ref&gt; was, about the year 300 AD, martyred in the following way, according to one tale: One stone was fastened to his head, another bound to his feet. His middle was then fastened by a rope to the top of a wall, and the stones released from the height. His body was ripped apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Münchhausen|first=Albert F., Freiherr von|title=Die Attribute der Heiligen, alphabetisch geordnet (etc.) Nebst einem Anh.: uber die Kleidung der kath.

====A Christian martyr withstands being torn apart====
During the reign of the Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]] a Christian named Shamuna was, allegedly, torn apart in the following manner:{{quote|The governor immediately ordered that Shamuna should be made to kneel down on one side and that an iron chain should be fastened on his knee. This having been done, he hung him up head downwards by the foot with which he had made him kneel; the other he pulled downwards with a heavy piece of iron, which cannot be described in words: thus endeavouring to rend the champion in two. By this means the socket of the hip-bone was wrenched out of its place and Shamuna became lame.}}
Some time thereafter, Shamuna was taken down from his hanging position, and was beheaded instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0858.htm Martyrdom of Shamuna, Guria and Habib]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32779">The '''disposable soma theory of aging''' states that organisms age due to an evolutionary trade-off between growth, reproduction, and [[DNA repair|DNA repair maintenance]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kirkwood, T. | year = 1977 | title = Evolution of ageing | journal = Nature | volume = 270 | issue = | pages = 301–304 | doi=10.1038/270301a0| bibcode = 1977Natur.270..301K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Formulated by [[Thomas Kirkwood]], the disposable soma theory explains that an organism only has a limited amount of resources or "soma" that it can allocate to its various [[cellular processes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Gavrilov LA, Gavrilova NS | year = 2002 | title = Evolutionary theories of aging and longevity | journal = ScientificWorldJournal | volume = 7 | issue =2 | pages = 339–356 | doi=10.1100/tsw.2002.96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a greater investment in growth and reproduction would result in reduced investment in DNA repair maintenance, leading to increased [[Cell damage|cellular damage]], [[telomere#shortening|shortened telomeres]], accumulation of [[mutation#harmful mutations|mutations]], compromised [[stem cells]], and ultimately, [[senescence]]. Although many models, both animal and human, have appeared to support this theory, parts of it are still controversial. 
Specifically, while the [[evolutionary trade-off]] between [[Mechanistic target of rapamycin#Aging|growth and aging]] has been well established, 
the relationship between reproduction and aging is still without [[scientific consensus]], and the cellular mechanisms largely undiscovered.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Blagosklonny, MV | year = 2010| title = Why the disposable soma theory cannot explain why women live longer and why we age | journal = Aging | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 884–887 | doi=10.18632/aging.100253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and history ==

British biologist Thomas Kirkwood first proposed the disposable soma theory of aging in a 1977 [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] review article.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The theory was inspired by [[Leslie Orgel|Leslie Orgel's]] [[Error catastrophe|Error Catastrophe Theory of Aging]], which was published fourteen years earlier, in 1963. Orgel believed that the process of aging arose due to mutations acquired during the replication process, and Kirkwood developed the disposable soma theory in order to mediate Orgel's work with [[evolutionary genetics]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Principles==
The disposable soma theory of aging acts on the premise that there is a tradeoff in [[resource allocation]] between [[Maintenance of an organism|somatic maintenance]] and [[Parental investment|reproductive investment]]. Too low an investment in self-repair would be evolutionarily unsound, as the organism would likely die before reproductive age. However, too high an investment in self-repair would also be [[Fitness (biology)|evolutionarily unsound]] due to the fact that one's [[Survivorship curve|offspring would likely die before reproductive age]]. Therefore, there is a compromise and resources are partitioned accordingly. However, this compromise is thought to damage somatic repair systems, which can lead to [[DNA damage theory of aging|progressive cellular damage and senescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Drenos F, Kirkwood, TB | year = 2005| title = Modelling the disposable soma theory of ageing | journal = Mech Ageing Dev. | volume = 126 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–103| doi=10.1016/j.mad.2004.09.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repair costs can be categorized into three groups: (1) the costs of increased [[Regeneration (biology)#Tissues|durability of nonrenewable parts]]; (2) the costs of maintenance involving [[Autophagy|cell renewal]], and (3) the costs of intracellular maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kirkwood, TB, Rose MR | year = 1991| title = Evolution of senescence: late survival sacrificed for reproduction.| journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 332 | issue = 1262 | pages = 15–24| doi=10.1098/rstb.1991.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a nutshell, [[Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis|aging and decline is essentially a tradeoff]] for increased reproductive robustness in youth.

== Mechanisms == 
[[File:IGF-1Pathway.png|thumb|The [[IGF-1|IGF-1 pathway]], which represses [[FOXO]], thus preventing [[gene expression]] of longevity-inducing proteins.]]

=== Growth and somatic maintenance === 
{{main|Mechanistic target of rapamycin#Aging}}
Much research has been done on the antagonistic effects of increased growth on lifespan. Specifically, the hormone [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1), binds to a cell receptor, leading to a [[phosphorylation cascade]]. This cascade results in kinases phosphorylating [[FOX proteins|forkhead transcription factor]] (FOXO), deactivating it. Deactivation of FOXO results in an inability to express genes involved in responding to [[oxidative stress |oxidative stress response]], such as [[antioxidants]], [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperones]], and [[heat-shock proteins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=O'Neill BT, Lee KY, Klaus K, Softic S; et al. | year = 2016 | title = Insulin and IGF-1 receptors regulate FoxO-mediated signaling in muscle proteostasis | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 126 | issue = 9 | pages = 3433-3346 | doi=10.1172/JCI86522| pmc = 5004956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Additionally, uptake of IGF-1 stimulates the [[Mechanistic target of rapamycin|mTOR]] pathway, which activates protein synthesis (and therefore growth) through upregulation of the translation-promoting [[P70-S6 Kinase 1|S6K1]], and also inhibits [[autophagy]], a process necessary for recycling of damaged cellular products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Johnson SC, Rabinovitch PS, Kaeberlein M| year = 2013 | title = mTOR is a key modulator of ageing and age-related disease| journal = Nature | volume = 493 | issue = | pages = 338–345 | doi=10.1038/nature11861| bibcode = 2013Natur.493..338J| pmc = 3687363}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Decline of autophagy causes [[neurodegeneration]], [[protein aggregation]] and [[premature aging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Komatsu M, Waguri S, Chiba T, Murata S; et al. | year = 2006 | title = Loss of autophagy in the central nervous system causes neurodegeneration in mice | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = | pages = 880–884 | doi=10.1038/nature04723| bibcode = 2006Natur.441..880K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, studies have also indicated that the mTOR pathway also alters [[immune responses]] and  stimulates [[cyclin-dependent kinase]] (CDK) inhibitors such as [[p16]] and [[p21]]. This leads to alteration of the [[stem-cell niche]] and results in [[Stem cell theory of aging|stem cell exhaustion]], another theorized mechanism of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Castilho RM1, Squarize CH, Chodosh LA, Williams BO; et al. | year = 2009| title = mTOR mediates Wnt-induced epidermal stem cell exhaustion and aging.| journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–289. | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2009.06.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction and somatic maintenance===
The mechanism of why reproduction inhibits lifespan with regards to multicellular organisms is still unclear. Although many models do illustrate an inverse relationship, and the theory makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, [[Cell signaling|the cellular mechanisms]] have yet to be explored. However, with regards to [[cellular replication]], the progressive shortening of telomeres is a mechanism which [[Hayflick limit|limits the amount of generations of a single cell may undergo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Shay JW, Wright WE | year = 2011 | title = Role of telomeres and telomerase in cancer | journal = Semin Cancer Biol. | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 349–353 | doi=10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in unicellular organisms like ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', the formation of [[extrachromosomal rDNA circle]]s (ERCs) in mother cells (but not daughter cells) upon every subsequent division is an identifiable type of DNA damage that is associated with replication. These ERCs accumulate over time and eventually trigger replicative senescence and death of the mother cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kaeberlein M, McVey M, Guarente L | year = 1999 | title = The SIR2/3/4 complex and SIR2 alone promote longevity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by two different mechanisms| journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 13 | issue = 19| pages = 2570–2580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==

===Growth and aging===
There is a large body of evidence indicating the negative effects of growth on longevity across many species. As a general rule, individuals of a smaller size generally live longer than larger individuals of the same species.

==== Animal models ====
In [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] models of [[Mus musculus|mice]], such Snell or Ames mice, mutations have arisen, either rendering them incapable of producing IGF-1 or unable to have adequate receptors for IGF-1 uptake. Furthermore, mice injected with growth hormone have been shown to have progressive weight loss, roughing of the coat, [[Scoliosis|curvature of the spine]], [[Hypertrophy|enlargement of the organs]], kidney lesions and [[Cancer|increased cancer risk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Bartke A1, Brown-Borg H | year = 2004 | title = Life extension in the dwarf mouse | journal = Curr Top Dev Biol. | volume = 63 | issue =  | pages = 189–225| doi=10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is also seen in different breeds of [[dogs]], where smaller breeds of dogs typically live significantly longer compared to their larger counterparts. Selectively bred for their small size, smaller dog breeds like the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] (average lifespan of 15–20 years) have the B/B genotype for the IGF-1 [[haplotype]], reducing the amount of IGF-1 produced. Conversely, large dogs like the [[Great Dane]] (average lifespan of 6–8 years) are [[homozygous]] for the IGF-1 I [[allele]], which increases the amount of IGF-1 production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Sutter NB, Bustamante CD, Chase K, Gray MM | year = 2007| title =A Single IGF1 Allele Is a Major Determinant of Small Size in Dogs| journal = Science | volume = 316 | issue = 5821 | pages = 112–115 | doi=10.1126/science.1137045| bibcode =2007Sci...316..112S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human models====
Initially, it was believed that growth hormone actually prolonged lifespan due to a 1990 study that indicated that injection of [[growth hormone]] to men over 60 years of age appeared to reverse various [[biomarkers]] implicated in aging, such as [[Sarcopenia|decreased muscle mass]], bone density, skin thickness, and increased adipose tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rudman D1, Feller AG, Nagraj HS, Gergans GA; et al. | year = 1990| title =Effects of human growth hormone in men over 60 years old| journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 323 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199007053230101}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 1999 study found that administering growth hormone also significantly increased [[mortality rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Takala J1, Ruokonen E, Webster NR, Nielsen MS, Zandstra DF, et al. | year = 1999| title =
Increased mortality associated with growth hormone treatment in critically ill adults| journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 341 | issue = 11 | pages = 785–792 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199909093411102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[Genome Sequencing|genomic studies]] have confirmed that the genes involved in growth hormone uptake and signaling are largely conserved across a plethora of species, such as yeast, nematodes, fruit flies, mice and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Longo VD, Finch CE.| year = 2003| title =Evolutionary medicine: from dwarf model systems to healthy centenarians?| journal = Science | volume = 299 | issue = 5611 | pages = 1342–1346 | doi=10.1126/science.1077991}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have also shown that individuals with [[Laron syndrome]], an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder resulting in dwarfism due to defects in growth hormone receptors, have increased lifespan. Additionally, these individuals have much lower [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidences]] of age-related diseases such as [[type 2 diabetes]] and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Guevara-Aguirre J, Balasubramanian P, Guevara-Aguirre M, Wei M; et al. | year = 2011| title = Growth hormone receptor deficiency is associated with a major reduction in pro-aging signaling, cancer, and diabetes in humans | journal = Sci. Transl. Med. | volume = 3 | issue = 70 | pages = 70–83 | doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3001845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lastly, human [[centenarians]] around the world are disproportionately of [[short stature]], and have low levels of IGF-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Govindaraju D, Atzmon G, Barzilai N. | year = 2015| title =Genetics, lifestyle and longevity: Lessons from centenarians.| journal = Appl Transl Genom.  | volume = 4| issue =  | pages = 23–32 | doi=10.1016/j.atg.2015.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction and aging===
Numerous studies have found that lifespan is inversely correlated with both the total amount of offspring birthed, as well as the age at which females first gives birth, also known as primiparity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Descamps S, Boutin S, Berteaux D, Gaillard JM.| year = 2006| title =Best squirrels trade a long life for an early reproduction| journal = Proc Biol Sci   | volume = 273| issue = 1599 | pages = 2369–2374 | doi= 10.1098/rspb.2006.3588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it has been found that [[Sexual reproduction|reproduction]] is a costly mechanism that alters the [[Fatty acid metabolism|metabolism of fat]]. [[Lipids]] invested in reproduction would be unable to be allocated to support mechanisms involved in somatic maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hansen M, Flatt T, Aguilaniu H.| year = 2013| title =Reproduction, fat metabolism, and life span: what is the connection?| journal = Cell Metab.| volume = 17| issue = 1 | pages = 10–19 | doi= 10.1016/j.cmet.2012.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==== Animal models ====

The disposable soma theory has been consistent with the majority of animal models. It was found in numerous animal studies that [[castration]] or [[Genetic disorder|genetic deformities]] of [[Reproductive system|reproduction organs]] was [[correlated]] with increased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Drori D, Folman Y.| year = 1976| title =Environmental effects on longevity in the male rat: exercise, mating, castration and restricted feeding| journal = Exp Gerontol.| volume = 11| issue = 1 | pages = 25–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Flatt T| year = 2011| title =Survival costs of reproduction in ''Drosophila''.| journal = Exp Gerontol.| volume = 46| issue = 5 | pages = 369–375 | doi= 10.1016/j.exger.2010.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hsin H, Kenyon C| year = 1999| title =Signals from the reproductive system regulate the lifespan of ''C. elegans''| journal =Nature| volume =399| issue = 6734 | pages = 362–366 | doi= 10.1038/20694| bibcode =1999Natur.399..362H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in [[red squirrels]], it was found that females with an early primiparity achieved the highest immediate and lifetime reproductive success. However, it was also found that these same individuals had a decreased median and maximum lifespan. Specifically squirrels who mated earlier had a 22.4% rate of mortality until two years of age compared to a 16.5% rate of mortality in late breeders. In addition, these squirrels had an average maximum lifespan of 1035 days compared to an average maximum lifespan of 1245 days for squirrels that bred later.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In another study, researchers selectively bred [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] over three years to develop two different [[strain (biology)|strain]]s, an early-reproducing strain and a late-reproducing strain. The late-reproducing line had a significantly longer lifespan than the early-reproducing line. Even more telling was that when the researchers introduced a mutation in the [[Ovarian|ovarian-associated]] gene ''ovoD1'', resulting in defective [[oogenesis]], the differences in lifespan between the two lines disappeared. The researchers in this case concluded that "aging has evolved primarily because of the damaging effects of reproduction earlier in life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Sgrò CM, Partridge L| year = 1999| title = A delayed wave of death from reproduction in Drosophila.| journal =Science| volume =286| issue =5449 | pages = 2521–2524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent aging researcher [[Steven N. Austad|Steven Austad]] also performed a large-scale [[ecological]] study on the [[coast]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1993. Austad isolated two [[opossum]] populations, one from the [[predator]]-infested mainland and one from the predator-absent nearby island of [[Sapelo]]. According to the disposable soma theory, a [[Genetic isolate|genetically isolated]] population subject to low environmentally-induced mortality would evolve delayed reproduction and aging. This is because without the pressure of predation, it would be evolutionarily advantageous to allocate more resources to somatic maintenance than reproduction, as early offspring mortality would be low. As predicted, even after controlling for predation, the isolated population had a longer lifespan, delayed primiparity, and reduced aging biomarkers such as tail [[collagen]] [[Cross linking|cross-linking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Austad, SN| year = 1993| title =Retarded senescence in an insular population of Virginia opossums (''Didelphis virginiana'')| journal = Journal of Zoology| volume = 229| issue = 4 | pages = 695–708 | doi= 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1993.tb02665.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human models ====

In general, only a few studies exist in human models. It was found that [[Eunuch|castrated men]] live longer than their [[fertile]] counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hamilton JB, Mestler GE| year = 1969| title =Mortality and survival: comparison of eunuchs with intact men and women in a mentally retarded population)| journal = J. Gerontol.| volume = 24| issue = 4 | pages = 395–411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies found that in British women, primiparity was earliest in women who died early and latest in women who died at the oldest ages. Furthermore, increased number of children birthed was associated with a decreased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Westendorp RG, Kirkwood TB| year = 1998| title =Human longevity at the cost of reproductive success |journal = Nature| volume = 396| issue = 6713 | pages = 743–746 | doi= 10.1038/25519}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final study found that female centenarians were more likely to have children in later life compared average, especially past the age of 40. The researchers discovered that 19.2% of female centenarians had their first child after the age of 40, compared to 5.5% of the rest of the female population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Perls TT, Alpert L, Fretts RC| year = 1997| title =Middle-aged mothers live longer |journal = Nature| volume = 389| issue = 6647 | pages = 133 | doi= 10.1038/38148| bibcode = 1997Natur.389..133P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship between cell damage and aging===
{{main|Free radical theory}}{{main|DNA damage theory of aging}}
[[File:Naked Mole Rat Eating.jpg|thumb|The [[naked mole rat]] has a [[naked mole rat#Longevity|disproportionately long life of 30 years]] through efficient cellular repair mechanisms.]]
There are numerous studies that support cellular damage, often due to a lack of somatic maintenance mechanisms, as a primary determinant for aging, and these studies have given rise to the [[free radical theory of aging]] and the [[DNA damage theory of aging]]. One study found that the cells of short-living rodents ''[[in vitro]]'' show much greater [[mutation]] rates and a general lack of genome surveillance compared to human cells and are far more susceptible to [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Lorenzini A, Stamato T, Sell C. | year = 2011| title = The disposable soma theory revisited: time as a resource in the theories of aging | journal = Cell Cycle| volume = 10 | issue = 22 | pages = 3853–3856 | doi=10.4161/cc.10.22.18302}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Other studies have been conducted on the [[naked mole rat]], a rodent species with remarkable longevity (30 years), capable of outliving the [[brown rat]] (3 years) by [[Fold (higher-order function)|ten-fold]]. Additionally, almost no incidence cancer has ever been detected in naked mole rats. Nearly all of the differences found between these two organisms, which are otherwise rather genetically similar, was in somatic maintenance. Naked mole rats were found to have higher levels of [[superoxide dismutase]], a [[reactive oxygen species]] clearing [[antioxidant]]. In addition, naked mole rats had higher levels of [[base excision repair]], DNA damage response signaling, [[Homologous recombination|homologous recombination repair]], [[mismatch repair]], [[nucleotide excision repair]], and [[non-homologous end joining]]. In fact, many of these processes were near or exceeded human levels. Proteins from naked mole rats were also more resistant to [[oxidation]], [[misfolding]], [[ubiquitination]], and had increased [[Translation|translational fidelity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Azpurua J, Ke Z, Chen IX, Zhang Q, Ermolenko DN; et al. | year = 2013| title = Naked mole-rat has increased translational fidelity compared with the mouse, as well as a unique 28S ribosomal RNA cleavage | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A| volume = 110 | issue = 43 | pages =17350–17355 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1313473110| bibcode =2013PNAS..11017350A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies have been conducted on patients with [[Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome]] (HGPS), a condition that leads to premature aging. Patients with HGPS typically age about seven times faster than average and usually succumb to the disease in their early teens. Patients with HGPS have cellular defects, specifically in the [[Lamin A protein|lamin proteins]], which regulate the organization of the [[Nuclear lamina|lamina]] and [[nuclear envelope]] for [[mitosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Pollex RL1, Hegele RA | year = 2004| title = Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome | journal = Clin. Genet.| volume = 66| issue = 5 | pages =375–381 | doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.2004.00315.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Lastly, as mentioned previously, it has been found that the suppression of autophagy is associated with reduced lifespan, while stimulation is associated with extended lifespan. Activated in times of [[caloric restriction]], autophagy is a process that prevents cellular damage through clearance and [[recycling]] of damaged proteins and [[organelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Glick D1, Barth S, Macleod KF. | year = 2010| title = Autophagy: cellular and molecular mechanisms| journal = J. Pathol. | volume = 221 | issue = 1 | pages =3–12| doi=10.1002/path.2697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism==
One of the main weaknesses of the disposable soma theory is that it does not postulate any specific cellular mechanisms to which an organism shifts energy to somatic repair over reproduction. Instead, it only offers an [[Evolution|evolutionary perspective]] on why aging may occur due to reproduction. Therefore, parts of it are rather limited outside of the field of [[evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

===Caloric restriction===
{{main|Calorie restriction#Sirtuin-mediated mechanism}}
[[File:Soma Disposable.png|thumb|Schematic showing the reallocation of energy investment towards [[DNA repair|self-repair]] during [[caloric restriction]].]]
Critics have pointed out the supposed [[Inconsistency|inconsistencies]] of the disposable soma theory due to the observed effects of caloric restriction, which is correlated with increased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Blagosklonny, MV| year = 2010| title = Solving puzzles of aging: From disposable soma to signal-transduction pathways| journal = Russ J Gen Chem. | volume = 80 | issue = | pages =1407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it activates autophagy, according to classical disposable soma principles, with less [[Caloric|caloric intake]], there would less total energy to be distributed towards somatic maintenance, and decreased lifespan would be observed (or at least the positive autophagic effects would be balanced out). However, Kirkwood, alongside his collaborator Darryl P. Shanley, assert that caloric restriction triggers an adaptive mechanism which causes the organism to shift a higher proportion of resources to somatic maintenance, away from reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Shanley DP, Kirkwood TB.| year = 2000| title = Calorie restriction and aging: a life-history analysis.| journal = Evolution | volume = 54 | issue =3 | pages =1407}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is supported by multiple studies, which show that caloric restriction typically results in [[Sterility (physiology)|impaired fertility]], but leave an otherwise healthy organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Holliday R.| year = 2000| title = Food, reproduction and longevity: is the extended lifespan of calorie-restricted animals an evolutionary adaptation?| journal = BioEssays | volume = 10 | issue =4 | pages =125–127|doi=10.1002/bies.950100408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Masoro EJ, Austad SN.| year = 1996| title = The evolution of the antiaging action of dietary restriction: a hypothesis.| journal = J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci | volume = 51 | issue =6 | pages =387–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionarily, an organism would want to delay reproduction to when resources were more plentiful. During a resource-barren period, it would evolutionarily unwise to invest resources in progeny that would be unlikely to survive in [[famine]]. Mechanistically, the [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]-dependent [[Deacetylate|deacetylase]] [[Sirtuin 1]] (SIRT-1) is upregulated during low-nutrient periods. SIRT-1 increases [[insulin sensitivity]], decreases the amount of [[inflammatory cytokine]]s, stimulates autophagy, and activates FOXO, the aforementioned protein involved in activating stress response genes. SIRT-1 is also found to result in decreased fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Cantó C, Auwerx J.| year = 2009| title = Caloric restriction, SIRT1 and longevity.| journal =Trends Endocrinol Metab| volume = 20 | issue =7 | pages =325–331|doi=10.1016/j.tem.2009.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In additional to differential [[wikt:partitioning|partitioning]] of energy allocation during caloric restriction, less caloric intake would result in less metabolic waste in the forms of [[free radicals]] like [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[superoxide]] and [[hydroxyl radicals]], which damage important cellular components, particularly [[mitochondria]]. Elevated levels of free radicals in mice has been correlated with neurodegeneration, [[Myocardial|myocardial injury]], [[Anemia|severe anemia]], and premature death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Pérez VI, Bokov A, Van Remmen H, Mele J; et al.| year = 2009| title = Is the oxidative stress theory of aging dead?| journal =Biochim Biophys Acta| volume = 1790 | issue =10 | pages =1005–1014|doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Grandmother hypothesis===
{{main|Menopause#Evolutionary rationale}}
Another primary criticism of the disposable soma theory is that it fails to account for why women tend to live longer than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Ginter E, Simko V | year = 2013| title = Women live longer than men| journal = Bratisl Lek Listy.  | volume = 114 | issue = 2 | pages =45–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterall, females invest significantly more resources into reproduction and according to the classical disposable soma principles, this would compromise energy diverted to somatic maintenance. However, this can be reconciled with the [[grandmother hypothesis]]. The Grandmother Hypothesis states that [[menopause]] comes about into older women in order to restrict the time of reproduction as a protective mechanism. This would allow women to live longer and increase the amount of care they could provide to their [[grandchildren]], increasing their evolutionary fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hawkes K | year = 2003| title = Grandmothers and the evolution of human longevity| journal = Am. J. Hum. Biol.| volume =15 | issue =3  | pages =380–400| doi= 10.1002/ajhb.10156}}&lt;/ref&gt; And so, although women do invest a greater proportion of resources into reproduction during their [[Age and female fertility|fertile years]], their overall reproductive period is significantly shorter than men, who are able of reproduction during and even beyond [[middle age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Vinicius L, Mace R, Migliano A| year = 2014| title = Variation in Male Reproductive Longevity across Traditional Societies| journal = PLoS One| volume =9 | issue =11  | pages =e112236| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0112236| bibcode =2014PLoSO...9k2236V}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, males invest more resources into growth, and have significantly higher levels of IGF-1 compared to females, which is correlated with decreased lifespan. Other variables such as increased [[Testosterone|testosterone levels]] in males are not accounted for. Increased testosterone is often associated with reckless behaviour, which may lead to a high accidental death rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Celec P, Ostatníková D, Hodosy J. | year = 2015| title = On the effects of testosterone on brain behavioral functions| journal = Front. Neurosci.| volume =9 | issue =  | pages =12| doi=10.3389/fnins.2015.00012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contradicting models === 
A few [[Contradiction|contradicting]] animal models weaken the validity of the disposable soma theory. This includes studies done on the aforementioned naked mole rats. In these studies, it was found that reproductive naked mole rats actually show significantly increased lifespans compared to non-reproductive individuals, which contradicts the principles of diposable soma. However, although these naked mole rats are [[mammalian]], they are highly [[atypical]] in terms of aging studies and may not serve as the best model for humans. For example, naked mole rats have a disproportionately high longevity quotient and live in [[Eusociality|eusocial societies]], where breeding is usually designated to a [[Eusociality#In mammals|queen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Dammann P, Burda H | year = 2006| title =Sexual activity and reproduction delay ageing in a mammal.| journal = Curr. Biol.| volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 117–118 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.02.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex biases and environment ===
The disposable soma theory is tested disproportionately on female organisms for the relationship between reproduction and aging, as [[Parental investment#Females as the more investing sex|females carry a greater burden in reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hammers M, Richardson DS, Burke T, Komdeur J. | year = 2013| title = The impact of reproductive investment and early-life environmental conditions on senescence: support for the disposable soma hypothesis.| journal = J Evol Biol | volume = 26| issue = 9 | pages = 1999–2007| doi=10.1111/jeb.12204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, for the relationship between growth and aging, studies are disproportionately conducted on males, to minimize the [[Estrogen|hormonal fluctuations]] that occur with [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Wu JJ, Liu J, Chen EB, Wang JJ; et al. | year = 2013| title = Increased mammalian lifespan and a segmental and tissue-specific slowing of aging after genetic reduction of mTOR expression| journal = Cell Rep. | volume = 4| issue = 5 | pages = 913–920| doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2013.07.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, [[aging#Biological basis|genetic]] and [[Gene–environment interaction|environmental factors]], rather than reproductive patterns, may explain the variations in human lifespan. For example, studies have shown that [[Poverty|poorer individuals]], to whom nutritious food and [[medical care]] is less accessible, typically have higher birth rates and earlier primiparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Murray, S. | year = 2006| title = Poverty and health| journal = CMAJ | volume = 174| issue = 7 | pages = 923| doi=10.1503/cmaj.060235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12032">'''Djwal Khul''' (variously spelled 'Djwhal Khul', 'Djwal Kul', the 'Master D.K.', 'D.K.', or simply 'DK'), is believed by some [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] and others to be a [[Tibet]]an disciple in the tradition of ancient [[esoteric]] spirituality known as The Ageless Wisdom tradition. The texts describe him as a member of the '[[Spiritual Hierarchy]]', or 'Brotherhood', of [[Mahatma]]s, one of the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]], defined as the spiritual guides of mankind and teachers ancient [[cosmological]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], and esoteric principles that form the origin of all the world's great philosophies, mythologies and spiritual traditions.&lt;ref name="neff"&gt;{{cite book|last= Neff |first=Mary K. |title= Brothers of Madame Blavatsky |pages= 31, 46–47|year=2003 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn= 0766157822}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theosophical writings, Djwal Khul is said to work on furthering the spiritual evolution of our planet through the teachings offered in the 24 books by [[Alice Bailey]] of Esoteric Teachings published by The Lucis Trust; he is said to have telepathically transmitted the teachings to Bailey and is thus regarded by her followers as the [[communications director]] of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom.

==In Theosophy and the writings of Alice Bailey==
{{Theosophy}}

Djwal Khul's name first appeared in the work of [[Madame Blavatsky]], a co-founder of the [[Theosophical Society]] and author of "[[The Secret Doctrine]]", published in 1888, which was primarily written by Koot Hoomi and Morya, according to Blavatsky and others in the Mahatma letters.&lt;ref&gt;The Writing of The Secret Doctrine - By Kirby Van Mater - www.theosociety.org/pasadena/invit-sd/invsd-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letters from the Masters of the Wisdom, No. 19, 1:47, 5th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey writes in August 1934, in the first person voice of DK: [I am] "a Tibetan disciple of a certain degree, and this tells you but little, for all are disciples from the humblest aspirant up to and beyond The Christ Himself. I live in a physical body like other men on the borders of Tibet and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over a large group of Tibetan Lamas, when my other duties permit."&lt;ref name="bailey"&gt;{{cite book|last= Bailey |first= Alice. A |title= Discipleship in The New Age vol.1|pages= vii|year=1944|publisher=Lucis Trust }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some writings, his name was omitted and he was referred to by the abbreviation "Master D. K." or the appellation "The Tibetan".&lt;ref name="neff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guenon"&gt;{{cite book|last= Guenon |first= Rene |translator=Alvin Moore, Jr. |translator2=Cecil Bethell|title= Theosophy: History of a Pseudo-Religion|pages= 41–42|year=2004 |publisher=Sophia Perennis |isbn= 0900588802}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackay,  Alex, ''The History of Tibet.'' Routledge University Press, 2003, p. 714&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Esoteric Healing,'' Lucis Trust. 1951. p 714&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 [[Alice Bailey]] (1880–1949), severed her links with the Theosophical Society for various reasons and later began writing books she described as being [[telepathy|telepathically]] dictated to her by Djwhal Khul whom she referred to as "The Tibetan"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Unfinished Autobiography''. Lucis Trust. 1951. pp 162-163&lt;/ref&gt; (later associated with the initials ''D.K.'').  According to Bailey, her D.K. was the main author behind Blavatsky's "The Secret Doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation Human and Solar,'' Lucis Trust., p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Esoteric Healing'', Lucis Trust., p. 521, 536, og 565&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Rays and Initiations,'' Lucis Trust., p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy,'' Lucis Trust., p. 685&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey stated that after initial resistance, she was eventually persuaded by the quality of what she had written in 'dictation' in the first few weeks work with DK to continue to write down the communications from this source.  She wrote for 30 years, from 1919 to 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Unfinished Autobiography''. Lucis Trust. 1951. From the Preface by Foster Bailey, p 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey wrote that Djwal Khul's intention was the revelation of [[esoteric]] teachings that were valuable for the continued training and teaching of spiritual aspirants in the 20th and early 21st century. She believed her work was done on behalf of the "spiritual hierarchy" of advanced beings, that included Djwal Khul, whose sole interest was to guide humanity towards the establishing of goodwill and right human relations, the vital first steps that would help prepare the way for the "Reappearance of the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Christ]]" (called by Theosophists ''The [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]]''). Alice Bailey's 24 books with DK were to be the second in a series of three revelations, after Blavatsky's "The Secret Doctrine", that were meant present the preparatory teachings that would serve to usher in the [[New Age]] referred to as the ''[[Age of Aquarius]]'',  because the astrological sign of Aquarius will soon succeed this present Piscean cycle in the cycle of the [[astrological age]]s.

In a preface included in many of Bailey's books, Djwal Khul, in the dictations described by Bailey, refers to the fact that he has been reported to be an abbot of a Tibetan monastery and the spiritual preceptor of a large group of [[lama]]s. She wrote that he lived in Northern India, near the borders of [[Tibet]]. Other than that the books do not include personal details about Djwal Khul and the dictated content focuses on his [[esoteric]] teachings.  Of the minimal personal details, Bailey writes that Djwhal Khul considers himself a disciple of a certain degree in the spiritual,  non-physical, [[ashram]] of the Master [[Koot Hoomi]], who is considered by Theosophists and other students of Alice Bailey's books to be another member of the same "spiritual hierarchy" of advanced beings.

[[C. W. Leadbeater]] claimed that he saw Djwal Khul [[Teleportation in theology|teleport]] into a room in which he and Madame Blavatsky were sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 Theosophical Publishing House Pages 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other New Age movements==

Bailey's work and her books with Djwal Khul were published by the [[Lucis Trust]],  an organization she set up with her husband, [[Foster Bailey]]. Over time, Djwal Khul's name has appeared in the writings about [[Ascended Master]]s (a phrase not used or sanctioned by either The Tibetan or Mrs. Bailey) of various [[New Age]] organizations (of debatable credibility according to some{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}) such as the ''[[Ascended Master Teachings]]'' of [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], who claims that she has channeled Djwal Khul as well as the other Mahatmas, such as ''[[Koot Hoomi]]'' and ''the Master El [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]]'', among many others, resulting in dozens of volumes of transcriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Klimo |first= Jon|author2=Charles Tart |title= Channeling: Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources|year= 1998 |publisher=North Atlantic Books |isbn= 1556432488 |page= 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of these groups described themselves as having direct contact with him and other "Masters of Wisdom", and to be working as their disciples on the physical plane. Within the Arcane School founded by Bailey, DK's works are studied along with other spiritual teachings of all ages. He is treated as a teacher and neither he nor his books have become objects of devotion.

==Previous incarnation==

According to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], one of Djwal Khul's previous incarnations was as Caspar, one of the [[Three Wise Men]] (the one who gave gold to [[Jesus]]).&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 - Summit University Press - Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function in the spiritual hierarchy==

It is believed by the followers of [[Benjamin Creme]] and the followers of the [[Alice Bailey]] teachings, that Djwal Khul coordinates the activities of the seven masters of the [[Seven Rays]] to advance the ''Plan of the Masters'' and functions as the [[communications director]] of the Ascended Masters since he is believed to have telepathically transmitted the teachings in the Alice A. Bailey material to Alice Bailey.

==Criticism==

The teachings of Djwal Khul, as conveyed through Bailey's many books in his name, contain and deal with many controversial topics, stating that there are widespread evils ingrained in popular ideas and statements about [[nationalism]], [[race relations]], [[American isolationism]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet totalitarianism]], [[fascism]], [[Nazism]], and [[Zionism]]. The books include content critical of the then current 19th century and early 20th century ideas and views about people of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] descent, [[Aboriginal Australians]], the [[Jewish people]] and [[Arabs]], and of [[Judaism]] and orthodox [[Christianity]] and fundamentalist movements of both East and West.

==Skeptical view==

The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.  Johnson asserts that the Djwal Khul was actually Dayal Singh Majithia, a member of the ''Singh Saba'', an [[Indian independence movement]] organization and [[Sikh]] reform movement.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K.

Also see the article “Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements” by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' October 5, 1980, which maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4007">In [[philosophy]], '''downward causation''' is a [[causal relationship]] from higher levels of a system to lower-level parts of that system: for example, mental events acting to cause physical events,&lt;ref name=Galaaen2006&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/24951/the_disturbing_matter.pdf?sequence=1|title=The Disturbing Matter of Downward Causation: A Study of the Exclusion Argument and its Causal-Explanatory Presuppositions|author=Øistein Schmidt Galaaen|date=2006|accessdate=2014-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally coined in 1974 by the philosopher and social scientist [[Donald T. Campbell]].&lt;ref name=Galaaen2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/DOWNCAUS.html|title=Downward Causation|publisher=Principia Cybernetica|accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==
[[File:Practopoietic cycle of causation.gif|thumb|Practopoietic cycle of causation]]According to [[practopoiesis|practopoietic]] theory of system organization,&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, Danko. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251931500106X "Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind."] Journal of Theoretical Biology 373 (2015): 40-61.&lt;/ref&gt; downward causation in biological systems always involves the environment. Downward causation does not occur by direct causal effects from higher to lower levels of system organisation. Instead, downward causation occurs indirectly because the mechanisms at higher levels of organisation fail to accomplish the tasks dictated by the lower levels of organisation. As a result, inputs from the environment signal to the mechanisms at lower levels of organisation that something is wrong and therefore, to act. For example, a species may find itself under evolutionary pressure to adjust to novel circumstances&amp;mdash;which is a form of downward pressure for adjustment. Similarly, an organism may be under downward pressure to express different genes if the expression patterns from the past did not lead to desired results. Another special case of downward causation is [[supervised learning]] (of neuronal networks) in which both behavior and environment governs the propagation from higher to lower levels.

This leads to a unique form of a causal interaction pattern&amp;mdash;called a ''practopoietic loop (cycle) of causation''. The end result is that the mechanisms responsible for mental events cause physical events only based on their joint interaction with the environment.

An interesting consequence is that neither behavior of an organism nor its mental operations can be considered fully or exclusively [[supervenience|supervenient]] on the body of the organism. On the one hand, behavior is not supervenient on all parts of the body. On the other hand, due to the necessary interactions with the environment at all levels of organization, behavior is supervenient also on some aspects of the environment. The same holds for the mental operations, or the [[mind]].

'''''Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting''''' is a 1984 book by the American philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], in which Dennett discusses the [[philosophy|philosophical]] issues of [[free will]] and [[determinism]].

In 1983, Dennett delivered the [[John Locke lectures|John Locke Lectures]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] on the topic of [[free will]]. In 1984, these ideas were published in the book ''Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting''. In this book Daniel Dennett explored what it means for people to have free will. The title, ''Elbow Room'', is a reference to the question: are we deterministic machines with no real freedom of action or do we in fact have some elbow room, some real [[rational choice theory|choice]] in our behavior?

==Synopsis==

===Determinism doesn't make humans equivalent to animals===
A major task taken on by Dennett in ''Elbow Room'' is to clearly describe just what people are as [[biology|biological]] entities and why they find the issue of free will to be of significance. In discussing what people are and why free will matters to us, Dennett makes use of an [[evolution]]ary perspective. Dennett describes the mechanical behavior of the digger [[wasp]] ''[[Sphex]]''. This insect follows a series of [[Genetics|genetically]] programmed steps in preparing for egg laying. If an experimenter interrupts one of these steps the wasp will repeat that step again. For an animal like a wasp, this process of repeating the same behavior can go on indefinitely, the wasp never seeming to notice what is going on. This is the type of mindless, pre-determined behavior that humans can avoid. Given the chance to repeat some futile behavior endlessly, people can notice the futility of it, and by an act of free will do something else. We can take this as an [[operational definition]] of what people mean by free will. Dennett points out the fact that as long as people see themselves as able to avoid futility, most people have seen enough of the free will issue. Dennett then invites all who are satisfied with this level of analysis to get on with living while he proceeds into the deeper hair-splitting aspects of the free will issue.

From a biological perspective, what is the difference between the wasp and a person? The person can, through interaction with his/her environment, construct an internal mental model of the situation and figure out a successful behavioral strategy. The wasp, with a much smaller brain and different genetic program, does not learn from its environment and instead is trapped in an endless and futile behavioral loop that is strictly determined by its genetic program. It is in this sense of people as animals with complex brains that can model reality and appear to choose among several possible behaviors that Dennett says we have free will.

===Both determinism and indeterminism seem to rule out free will===
The deeper philosophical issue of free will can be framed as a [[paradox]]. On one hand, we all feel like we have free will, a multitude of behavioral choices to select among. On the other hand, modern biology generally investigates humans as though the processes at work in them follow the same biological principles as those in wasps. How do we reconcile our feeling of free will with the idea that we might be [[mechanics|mechanical]] components of a mechanical [[universe]]?

What about [[determinism]]? When we say that a person chooses among several possible behaviors is there really a choice or does it just seem like there is a choice? Do people just (through the action of their more complex brains) simply have better behaviors than wasps, while still being totally mechanical in executing those behaviors? Dennett gives his definition of determinism on page one: ''All physical events are caused or determined by the sum total of all previous events''. This definition dodges a question that many people feel should not be dodged: if we repeatedly replayed the universe from the same point in time would it always reach the same future? Since we have no way of performing this experiment, this question is a long-term classic in philosophy and physicists have tried to interpret the results of other experiments in various ways in order to figure out the answer to this question. Modern day physics-oriented philosophers have sometimes tried to answer the question of free will using the [[many-worlds interpretation]], according to which every time there is [[quantum indeterminacy]] each possibility occurs and new universes branch off. Since the 1920s, physicists have been trying to convince themselves that quantum indeterminacy can in some way explain free will. Dennett suggests that this idea is silly. How, he asks, can random resolutions of quantum-level events provide people with any control over their behavior?

===Indeterminism is not a solution to the free will problem===
Since Dennett wrote ''Elbow Room'' (1984) there has been an ongoing attempt by some scientists to answer this question by suggesting that the brain is a device for controlling quantum indeterminacy so as to construct behavioral choice. Dennett argues that such efforts to salvage free will by finding a way out of the prison of determinism are wasted. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Control is the kind of freedom "worth wanting"===
Dennett discusses many types of free will (1984). Many philosophers have claimed that determinism and free will are [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|incompatible]]. What the physicists seem to be trying to construct is a type of free will that involves a way for brains to make use of quantum indeterminacy so as to make choices that alter the universe in our favor, or if there are multiple universes, to choose among the possible universes. Dennett suggests that we can have another kind of free will, a type of free will which we can be perfectly happy with even if it does not give us the power to act in more than one way at any given time. Dennett is able to accept determinism and free will at the same time. How so?

===We have free will===
The type of free will that Dennett thinks we have is finally stated clearly in the last chapter of the book: the power to be active agents, biological devices that respond to our environment with [[rationalism|rational]], desirable courses of action. Dennett has slowly, through the course of the book, stripped the idea of behavioral choice from his idea of free will. How can we have free will if we do not have indeterministic choice? Dennett emphasizes control over [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian choice]]. If our hypothetically mechanical brains are in control of our behavior and our brains produce good behaviors for us, then do we really need such choice? Is an [[illusion]] of behavioral choices just as good as actual choices? Is our sensation of having the freedom to execute more than one behavior at a given time really just an illusion?  Dennett argues that choice exists in a general sense: that because we base our decisions on context, we limit our options as the situation becomes more specific.  In the most specific circumstance (actual events), he suggests there is only one option left to us.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

:"It is this contrast between the stable and the chaotic that grounds our division of the world into the enduring and salient features of the world, and those features that we must treat statistically or probabilistically. And this division of the world is not just our division; it is, for instance, mother nature's division as well. Since for all mother nature knows (or could know) it is possible that these insects will cross paths (sometime, somewhere) with insectivorous birds, they had better be designed with some avoidance machinery. This endows them with a certain power that will serve well (in general)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=Daniel C.|title=Elbow room : the varieties of free will worth wanting|year=1984|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0-262-04077-8|pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Determinism does not rule out moral responsibility===
If people are determined to act as they do, then what about personal [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]? How can we hold people responsible and punish them for their behaviors if they have no choice in how they behave? Dennett gives a two-part answer to this question:

First, we hold people responsible for their actions because we know from historical experience that this is an effective means to make people behave in a socially acceptable way. Second, holding people responsible only works when combined with the fact that people can be informed of the fact that they are being held responsible and respond to this state of affairs by controlling their behavior so as to avoid punishment. People who break the rules set by society and get punished may be behaving in the only way they can, but if we did not hold them accountable for their actions, people would behave even worse than they do with the threat of punishment. This is a totally [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach to the issue of responsibility. Expressing [[morality|moral]] indignation when people break the rules of proper behaviour is only useful to the extent that it contributes to dissuading such behaviour. Again, an argument from utility. Is it, then, moral to punish people who are unable to do other than break a rule? Yes, people have the right to come together and improve their condition by creating rules and enforcing them. We would be worse off if we did not do so. Again, an argument from utility.

===Fatalism is destructive===
One final issue: if people do not have real behavioral choices, why not collapse into [[fatalism]]? Again, Dennett's argument is that we may not have behavioral choice, but we do have control of our behavior. Dennett asks us to look around at the universe and ask, can I even conceive of beings whose will is freer than our own? For Dennett, the answer to this question is, no, not really. In ''Elbow Room'', he tries to explain why all the attempts that people have tried to make to prove that people have [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian choice]] have failed and are, in the final analysis, not really important anyhow. As humans, we are as much in control of our behavior as anything in the universe. As humans, we have the best chance to produce good behavior. We should be satisfied with what we have and not fret over our lack of libertarian free will.

Some complaints about ''Elbow Room'' relate to our intuitions about free will. Some say{{Who|date=January 2015}} that Dennett's theory does not satisfactorily deal with the issue of why we feel so strongly that we do have behavioral choice. One answer to this question is the result of selection on individuals to live harmoniously in society. But one doesn't have to be free to achieve that goal. Another answer is that it tells us (our brains) whether we're doing something or someone else is doing something to us (e.g. shaking arm). But, again one does not have to be free to make such a distinction. A final answer to this question is that our sensation of having behavioral choice has been carefully selected by evolution. The well-developed human sensation of having free will and being able to select among possible behaviors has strong survival value. People who lose the feeling that they can plan alternative behaviors and execute their choice of possible behaviors tend to become fatalistic and stop struggling for survival. According to Dennett, belief in free will is a necessary condition for having free will. When we are planning for the future and thinking about possible actions to take in the future, we are utilizing considerable amounts of biologically expensive resources (brain power). Evolution has designed us to feel strongly that all of our effort of planning pays off, that we control what we do. If this connection between our brains' efforts to model reality and predict the future and so make possible good outcomes is disconnected from our sense of self and our will, then fatalism and self-destructive behaviors are close at hand. However, the same effect is attainted if, despite not believing in the control free will gives, we believe that does not prevent us to live as fully as our bodies allow us to and to try harder to achieve things if we think we have agency.

An '''expert''' is someone who has a prolonged or intense experience through practice and education in a particular field. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a [[reliabilism|reliable]] source of [[wikt:technique|technique]] or [[skill]] whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by [[Peer group|peer]]s or the [[General public|public]] in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive [[knowledge]] or [[Aptitude|ability]] based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of [[credential]], [[training]], [[education]], [[profession]], [[publication]] or [[experience]], to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may [[official]]ly (and [[expert witness|legally]]) rely upon the individual's [[opinion]]. Historically, an expert was referred to as a [[Wise old man|sage]] ([[Sage (Sophos)|Sophos]]). The individual was usually a profound [[Intellectual|thinker]] distinguished for [[wisdom]] and sound [[judgment]].

In specific fields, the definition of expert is well established by consensus and therefore it is not always necessary for individuals to have a professional or academic [[wikt:qualification|qualification]] for them to be accepted as an expert. In this respect, a shepherd with 50 years of experience tending flocks would be widely recognized as having complete expertise in the use and training of sheep dogs and the care of sheep. Another example from [[computer science]] is that an [[expert system]] may be taught by a human and thereafter considered an expert, often outperforming human beings at particular tasks. In [[law]], an [[expert witness]] must be recognized by [[Logical argument|argument]] and [[authority]].

Research in this area attempts to understand the relation between expert knowledge, skills and personal characteristics and exceptional performance. Some researchers have investigated the cognitive structures and processes of experts. The fundamental aim of this research is to describe what it is that experts know and how they use their knowledge to achieve performance that most people assume requires extreme or extraordinary ability. Studies have investigated the factors that enable experts to be fast and accurate.&lt;ref name='Ericsson1989'&gt;{{Harv|Ericsson|Stasewski|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expertise==
Expertise characteristics, skills and knowledge of a person (that is, expert) or of a system, which distinguish experts from novices and less experienced people. In many domains there are objective measures of performance capable of distinguishing experts from novices: expert chess players will almost always win games against recreational chess players; expert [[medical specialist]]s are more likely to diagnose a disease correctly; etc.

The word expertise is used to refer also to Expert Determination, where an expert is invited to decide a disputed issue. The decision may be binding or advisory, according to the agreement between the parties in dispute.

===Academic views===
There are two academic approaches to the understanding and study of expertise. The first understands expertise as an emergent property of [[communities of practice]]. In this view expertise is socially constructed; tools for thinking and scripts for action are jointly constructed within social groups enabling that group jointly to define and acquire expertise in some domain.

In the second view expertise is a characteristic of individuals and is a consequence of the human capacity for extensive adaptation to physical and social environments. Many accounts of the development of expertise emphasize that it comes about through long periods of deliberate practice. In many domains of expertise estimates of 10 years' experience&lt;ref name="Ericsson 2006"&gt;{{Harv|Ericsson|Charness|Feltovich|Hoffman|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; deliberate practice are common. Recent research on expertise emphasizes the nurture side of the [[nature and nurture]] argument.&lt;ref name="Ericsson 2006"/&gt; Some factors not fitting the nature-nurture dichotomy are biological but not genetic, such as starting age, handedness, and season of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gobet|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gobet|Chassy|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gobet|Campitelli|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of education there is a potential "expert blind spot" (see also [[Dunning–Kruger effect]]) in newly practicing educators who are experts in their content area. This is based on the "expert blind spot hypothesis" researched by [[Mitchell J. Nathan|Mitchell Nathan]] and Andrew Petrosino (2003: 906). Newly practicing educators with advanced subject-area expertise of an educational content area tend to use the formalities and analysis methods of their particular area of expertise as a major guiding factor of student instruction and knowledge development, rather than being guided by student learning and developmental needs that are prevalent among novice learners.

The blind spot metaphor refers to the physiological blind spot in human vision in which perceptions of surroundings and circumstances are strongly impacted by their expectations. Beginning practicing educators tend to overlook the importance of novice levels of prior knowledge and other factors involved in adjusting and adapting pedagogy for learner understanding. This expert blind spot is in part due to an assumption that novices’ cognitive schemata are less elaborate, interconnected, and accessible than experts’ and that their pedagogical reasoning skills are less well developed (Borko &amp; Livingston, 1989: 474). Essential knowledge of subject matter for practicing educators consists of overlapping knowledge domains: subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content matter (Borko, Eisenhart, Brown, Underhill, Jones, &amp; Agard, 1992: 195). Pedagogical content matter consists of an understanding of how to represent certain concepts in ways appropriate to the learner contexts, including abilities and interests. The expert blind spot is a pedagogical phenomenon that is typically overcome through educators’ experience with instructing learners over time.

===Historical views===
In line with the socially constructed view of expertise, expertise can also be understood as a form of [[power (sociology)|power]]; that is, experts have the ability to influence others as a result of their defined social status. By a similar token, a fear of experts can arise from fear of an intellectual elite's power. In earlier periods of history, simply being able to read made one part of an intellectual elite. The introduction of the [[printing press]] in Europe during the fifteenth century and the diffusion of printed matter contributed to higher literacy rates and wider access to the once-rarefied knowledge of academia. The subsequent spread of education and learning changed society, and initiated an era of widespread education whose elite would now instead be those who produced the written content itself for consumption, in education and all other spheres.

Plato's "[[Noble Lie]]", concerns expertise. Plato did not believe most people were clever enough to look after their own and society's best interest, so the few clever people of the world needed to lead the rest of the flock. Therefore, the idea was born that only the elite should know the truth in its complete form and the rulers, Plato said, must tell the people of the city "the noble lie" to keep them passive and content, without the risk of upheaval and unrest.

In contemporary society, doctors and scientists, for example, are considered to be experts in that they hold a body of dominant knowledge that is, on the whole, inaccessible to the layman.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Intellectual|last=Fuller|first=Steve|publisher=Icon Books|year=2005|isbn=9781840467215|location=|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this inaccessibility and perhaps even mystery that surrounds expertise does not cause the layman to disregard the opinion of the experts on account of the unknown. Instead, the complete opposite occurs whereby members of the public believe in and highly value the opinion of medical professionals or of scientific discoveries&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; , despite not understanding it.

===Related research===
A number of computational models have been developed in [[cognitive science]] to explain the development from novice to expert. In particular, [[Herbert A. Simon]] and Kevin Gilmartin proposed a model of learning in chess called MAPP (Memory-Aided Pattern Recognizer).&lt;ref&gt;Simon and Gilmartin (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on simulations, they estimated that about 50,000 [[chunking (psychology)#Chunking as the learning of long-term memory structures|chunks]] (units of memory) are necessary to become an expert, and hence the many years needed to reach this level. More recently, the [[CHREST|CHREST model]] (Chunk Hierarchy and REtrieval STructures) has simulated in detail a number of phenomena in chess expertise (eye movements, performance in a variety of memory tasks, development from novice to expert) and in other domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gobet|Simon|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gobet|de Voogt|Retschitzki|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important feature of expert performance seems to be the way in which experts are able to rapidly retrieve complex configurations of information from long-term memory. They recognize situations because they have meaning. It is perhaps this central concern with meaning and how it attaches to situations which provides an important link between the individual and social approaches to the development of expertise. Work on "Skilled Memory and Expertise" by [[Anders Ericsson]] and [[James J. Staszewski]] confronts the paradox of expertise and claims that people not only acquire content knowledge as they practice cognitive skills, they also develop mechanisms that enable them to use a large and familiar knowledge base efficiently.&lt;ref name="Ericsson1989" /&gt;

Work on [[expert systems]] (computer software designed to provide an answer to a problem, or clarify uncertainties where normally one or more human experts would need to be consulted) typically is grounded on the premise that expertise is based on acquired repertoires of rules and frameworks for decision making which can be elicited as the basis for computer supported judgment and decision-making. However, there is increasing evidence that expertise does not work in this fashion. Rather, experts recognize situations based on experience of many prior situations. They are in consequence able to make rapid decisions in complex and dynamic situations.

In a critique of the expert systems literature {{Harvtxt|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|2005}} suggest:
&lt;blockquote&gt; If one asks an expert for the rules he or she is using, one will, in effect, force the expert to regress to the level of a beginner and state the rules learned in school. Thus, instead of using rules they no longer remember, as knowledge engineers suppose, the expert is forced to remember rules they no longer use. … No amount of rules and facts can capture the knowledge an expert has when he or she has stored experience of the actual outcomes of tens of thousands of situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|2005|p=788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Skilled memory theory====
&lt;ref name="Ericsson1989" /&gt;
The role of long term memory in the skilled memory effect was first articulated by Chase and Simon in their classic studies of chess expertise. They asserted that organized patterns of information stored in long term memory (chunks) mediated experts' rapid encoding and superior retention. Their study revealed that all subjects retrieved about the same number of chunks, but the size of the chunks varied with subjects' prior experience. Experts' chunks contained more individual pieces than those of novices. This research did not investigate how experts find, distinguish, and retrieve the right chunks from the vast number they hold without a lengthy search of long term memory.

Skilled memory enables experts to rapidly encode, store, and retrieve information within the domain of their expertise and thereby circumvent the capacity limitations that typically constrain novice performance. For example, it explains experts' ability to recall large amounts of material displayed for only brief study intervals, provided that the material comes from their domain of expertise. When unfamiliar material (not from their domain of expertise) is presented to experts, their recall is no better than that of novices.

The first principle of skilled memory, the ''meaningful encoding principle,'' states that experts exploit prior knowledge to durably encode information needed to perform a familiar task successfully. Experts form more elaborate and accessible memory representations than novices. The elaborate semantic memory network creates meaningful memory codes that create multiple potential cues and avenues for retrieval.

The second principle, the ''retrieval structure principle'' states that experts develop memory mechanisms called retrieval structures to facilitate the retrieval of information stored in long term memory. These mechanisms operate in a fashion consistent with the meaningful encoding principle to provide cues that can later be regenerated to retrieve the stored information efficiently without a lengthy search.

The third principle, the ''speed up principle'' states that long term memory encoding and retrieval operations speed up with practice, so that their speed and accuracy approach the speed and accuracy of short term memory storage and retrieval.

Examples of skilled memory research described within the Ericsson and Stasewski study include:
* a '''waiter''' who can accurately remember up to 20 complete dinner orders in an actual restaurant setting by using mnemonic strategy, patterns, and spatial relations (position of the person ordering). At the time of recall all items of a category (e.g., all salad dressings, then all meat temperatures, then all steak types, then all starch type) would be recalled in clockwise for all customers.
* a '''running enthusiast''' who grouped together short random sequences of digits and encoded the groups in terms of their meaning as running times, dates, and ages. He was thus able to recall over 84% of all digit groups presented in a session totaling 200-300 digits. His expertise was limited to digits; when a switch from digits to letters of the alphabet was made he exhibited no transfer—his memory span dropped back to about six consonants.
* '''math enthusiasts''' who can in less than 25 seconds mentally solve 2 x 5 digit multiplication problems (e.g., 23 x 48,856) that have been presented orally by the researcher.

====In problem solving====
Much of the research regarding expertise involves the studies of how experts and novices differ in solving problems (Chi, M. T. H., Glasser R., &amp; Rees, E.,1982). Mathematics (Sweller, J., Mawer, R. F., &amp; Ward, M. R., 1983) and physics (Chi, Feltovich, &amp; Glaser, 1981) are common domains for these studies.

One of the most cited works in this area, Chi et al. (1981), examines how experts (PhD students in physics) and novices (undergraduate students that completed one semester of mechanics) categorize and represent physics problems. They found that novices sort problems into categories based upon surface features (e.g., keywords in the problem statement or visual configurations of the objects depicted). Experts, however, categorize problems based upon their deep structures (i.e., the main physics principle used to solve the problem).

Their findings also suggest that while the schemas of both novices and experts are activated by the same features of a problem statement, the experts’ schemas contain more procedural knowledge which aid in determining which principle to apply, and novices’ schemas contain mostly declarative knowledge which do not aid in determining methods for solution.

====Germain's scale====
Relative to a specific field, an expert has:
* Specific education, training, and knowledge
* Required qualifications
* Ability to assess importance in work-related situations
* Capability to improve themselves
* Intuition
* Self-assurance and confidence in their knowledge

Marie-Line Germain (Germain, 2006) developed a psychometric measure of perception of employee expertise called the Generalized Expertise Measure (GEM). She defined a behavioral dimension in experts, in addition to the dimensions suggested by Swanson and Holton (2001). Her 16-item scale contains objective expertise items and subjective expertise items. Objective items were named Evidence-Based items. Subjective items (the remaining 11 items from the measure below) were named Self-Enhancement items because of their behavioral component.

* This person has knowledge specific to a field of work.
* This person shows they have the education necessary to be an expert in the field.
* This person has the qualifications required to be an expert in the field.
* This person has been trained in their area of expertise.
* This person is ambitious about their work in the company.
* This person can assess whether a work-related situation is important or not.
* This person is capable of improving themselves.
* This person is charismatic.
* This person can deduce things from work-related situations easily.
* This person is intuitive in the job.
* This person is able to judge what things are important in their job.
* This person has the drive to become what they are capable of becoming in their field.
* This person is self-assured.
* This person has self-confidence.
* This person is outgoing.

==Rhetoric==

Scholars in [[rhetoric]] have also turned their attention to the concept of the expert. Considered an appeal to ethos or "the personal character of the speaker",&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. "Rhetoric." Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. The Basic Works of Aristotle. Ed. Richard McKeon. New York: Modern Library, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; established expertise allows a speaker to make statements regarding special topics of which the audience may be ignorant. In other words, the expert enjoys the deference of the audience’s judgment and can appeal to authority where a non-expert cannot.

In The Rhetoric of Expertise, E. Johanna Hartelius defines two basic modes of expertise: autonomous and attributed expertise. While an autonomous expert can "possess expert knowledge without recognition from other people," attributed expertise is "a performance that may or may not indicate genuine knowledge." With these two categories, Hartelius isolates the rhetorical problems faced by experts: just as someone with autonomous expertise may not possess the skill to persuade people to hold their points of view, someone with merely attributed expertise may be persuasive but lack the actual knowledge pertaining to a given subject. The problem faced by audiences follows from the problem facing experts: when faced with competing claims of expertise, what resources do non-experts have to evaluate claims put before them?&lt;ref&gt;Hartelius, E. Johanna. The Rhetoric of Expertise. Lanham: Lexington, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialogic Expertise===
Hartelius and other scholars have also noted the challenges that projects such as Wikipedia pose to how experts have traditionally constructed their authority. In "Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise", she highlights Wikipedia as an example of the "dialogic expertise" made possible by collaborative digital spaces. Predicated upon the notion that "truth emerges from dialogue", Wikipedia challenges traditional expertise both because anyone can edit it and because no single person, regardless of their credentials, can end a discussion by fiat. In other words, the community, rather than single individuals, direct the course of discussion. The production of knowledge, then, as a process of dialogue and argumentation, becomes an inherently rhetorical activity.&lt;ref&gt;Hartelus, E. Johanna. "Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise." Southern Communication Journal 75.5 (2010). Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartelius calls attention to two competing norm systems of expertise: “network norms of dialogic collaboration” and “deferential norms of socially sanctioned professionalism”; Wikipedia being evidence of the first.&lt;ref name="Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505"&gt;Hartelius, E. Johanna. (2011). Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise. Southern Communication Journal, Vol. 75, No. 5, Nov–Dec 2010, pp. 505–526.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on a [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtinian framework]], Hartelius posits that Wikipedia is an example of an epistemic network that is driven by the view that individuals’ ideas clash with one another so as to generate expertise collaboratively.&lt;ref name="Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505"/&gt; Hartelius compares Wikipedia’s methodology of open-ended discussions of topics to that of [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtin’s theory of speech communication]], where genuine [[dialogue]] is considered a live event, which is continuously open to new additions and participants.&lt;ref name="Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505"/&gt; Hartelius acknowledges that [[knowledge]], [[experience]], [[training]], [[skill]], and [[wikt:qualification|qualification]] are important dimensions of expertise but posits that the concept is more complex than sociologists and psychologists suggest.&lt;ref name="Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505"/&gt; Arguing that expertise is rhetorical, then, Hartelius explains that expertise: “(...) is not simply about one person’s skills being different from another’s. It is also fundamentally contingent on a struggle for ownership and legitimacy.”.&lt;ref name="Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505"/&gt; Effective communication is an inherent element in expertise in the same style as knowledge is. Rather than leaving each other out, substance and communicative style are complementary.&lt;ref name="Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505"/&gt; Hartelius further suggests that Wikipedia’s dialogic construction of expertise illustrates both the instrumental and the constitutive dimensions of rhetoric; instrumentally as it challenges [[Encyclopedia|traditional encyclopedias]] and constitutively as a function of its knowledge production.&lt;ref name="Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505"/&gt; Going over the historical development of the encyclopedic project, Hartelius argues that changes in traditional encyclopedias have led to changes in traditional expertise. Wikipedia’s use of [[hyperlink]]s to connect one topic to another depends on, and develops, electronic interactivity meaning that Wikipedia’s way of knowing is dialogic.&lt;ref name="Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505"/&gt; Dialogic expertise then, emerges from multiple interactions between utterances within the [[discourse community]].&lt;ref name="Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505"/&gt; The ongoing dialogue between contributors on Wikipedia not only results in the emergence of truth; it also explicates the topics one can be an expert of. As Hartelius explains: “The very act of presenting information about topics that are not included in traditional encyclopedias is a construction of new expertise.”.&lt;ref name="Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505"/&gt; While Wikipedia insists that contributors must only publish preexisting knowledge, the dynamics behind dialogic expertise creates new information nonetheless. Knowledge production is created as a function of dialogue.&lt;ref name="Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505"/&gt; According to Hartelius, dialogic expertise has emerged on Wikipedia not only because of its interactive structure but also because of the site’s hortative discourse which is not found in traditional encyclopedias.&lt;ref name="Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505"/&gt; By Wikipedia’s hortative discourse, Hartelius means various encouragements to edit certain topics and instructions on how to do so that appear on the site.&lt;ref name="Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505"/&gt; One further reason to the emergence of dialogic expertise on Wikipedia is the site’s [[Wikipedia:Community portal|community pages]], which function as a techne; explicating Wikipedia’s expert methodology.&lt;ref name="Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505"/&gt;

===Networked Expertise===
{{See also|Wisdom of the crowd}}
Building on Hartelius, Damien Pfister developed the concept of "networked expertise". Noting that Wikipedia employs a [[Many-to-many|"many to many"]] rather than a "one to one" model of communication, he notes how expertise likewise shifts to become a quality of a group rather than an individual. With the information traditionally associated with individual experts now stored within a text produced by a collective, knowing about something is less important than knowing how to find something. As he puts it, "With the internet, the historical power of subject matter expertise is eroded: the archival nature of the Web means that what and how to information is readily available." The rhetorical authority previously afforded to subject matter expertise, then, is given to those with the procedural knowledge of how to find information called for by a situation.&lt;ref&gt;Pfister, Damien. "Networked Expertise in the Era of Many-to-many Communication: On Wikipedia and Invention." Social Epistemology: A Journal of Knowledge, Culture, and Policy 25.3 (2011). Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrasts and comparisons==

===Associated terms===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
An expert differs from the specialist in that a specialist has to ''be able to solve'' a [[problem]] and an expert has to ''know its solution''. The opposite of an expert is generally known as a [[layperson]], while someone who occupies a middle grade of understanding is generally known as a [[technician]] and often employed to assist experts. A person may well be an expert in one field and a layperson in many other fields. The concepts of experts and expertise are debated within the field of [[epistemology]] under the general heading of expert knowledge. In contrast, the opposite of a specialist would be a [[wikt:generalist|generalist]] or [[polymath]].

The term is widely used informally, with people being described as 'experts' in order to bolster the relative value of their opinion, when no [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] criteria for their expertise is available. The term [[crank (person)|crank]] is likewise used to disparage opinions. [[Academic elitism]] arises when experts become convinced that only their opinion is useful, sometimes on matters beyond their personal expertise.

In contrast to an expert, a [[novice]] (known [[colloquially]] as a [[newbie]] or 'greenhorn') is any person that is new to any science or field of study or activity or social cause and who is undergoing training in order to meet normal requirements of being regarded a mature and equal participant.

"Expert" is also being mistakenly interchanged with the term "[[authority]]" in new media. An expert can be an authority if through relationships to people and technology, that expert is allowed to control access to his expertise. However, a person who merely wields authority is not by right an expert. In new media, users are being misled by the term "authority". Many sites and search engines such as Google and Technorati use the term "authority" to denote the link value and traffic to a particular topic. However, this authority only measures populist information. It in no way assures that the author of that site or blog is an expert.

===Developmental characteristics===
Some characteristics of the development of an expert have been found to include
* A characterization of this practice as "deliberate practice", which forces the practitioner to come up with new ways to encourage and enable themselves to reach new levels of performance{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}
* An early phase of learning which is characterized by enjoyment, excitement, and participation without outcome-related goals&lt;ref&gt;Janet L. Starkes, K Anders Ericsson (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=gl8nqUjyXWUC&amp;pg=PA91 Expert Performance in Sports] Advances in Research on Sport Expertise. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ability to rearrange or construct a higher dimension of creativity. Due to such familiarity or advanced knowledge experts can develop more abstract perspectives of their concepts and/or performances.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Use in literature==
[[Mark Twain]] defined an expert as "an ordinary fellow from another town".&lt;ref&gt;[needs quotation reference]{{Citation needed|reason=Is this the right template to use?|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Will Rogers]] described an expert as "A man fifty miles from home with a briefcase." Danish scientist and Nobel laureate [[Niels Bohr]] defined an expert as "A person that has made every possible mistake within his or her field."&lt;ref name="Life Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robert Coughlan|first1=Quoted by Dr Edward Teller|title=Dr. Edward Teller's Magnificent Obsession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I1QEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;hl=de#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Life Magazine|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Malcolm Gladwell]] describes expertise as a matter of practicing the correct way for a total of around 10,000 hours.

==Objectives==
Media Theorist [[Lisa Nakamura]] notes that "[as] women of color acquire an increasing presence online, their particular interests which spring directly from gender and racial identifications, that is to say, those identities associated with a physical body off-line, are being addressed."&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Lisa. “Cybertyping and the Work of Race in the Age of Digital Reproduction.” New Media, Old Media. Eds. Wendy Hui Kyong Chun and Thomas Keenan. Routledge: New York, 2006.p321&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, [[Science, technology and society|Science and Technology Studies]] professor [[Donna Haraway]] has also pioneered specifically feminist approaches to the study of digital humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Wajcman, Judy. “Addressing Technological Change: The Challenge to Social Theory.” Society, Ethics and Technology. Eds. Morton E. Winston and Ralph D. Edelbach. Cengage Learning: 2011. Page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

This intervention is notably crystallized in the work of [[FemTechNet]], "an activated network of scholars, artists, and students who work on, with, and at the borders of technology, science and feminism in a variety of fields including STS, Media and Visual Studies, Art, Women’s, Queer, and Ethnic Studies".&lt;ref&gt;http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/directories/&lt;/ref&gt; FemTechNet has collaborated on a number of projects that reflect the aims of Feminist Digital Humanities, including Wikistorming, DOCC: Distributed Open Collaborative Course, and video dialogues. Their methods emphasize distribution through networks to connect diverse institutions, nations, and fields.&lt;ref&gt;http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/docc2013/&lt;/ref&gt;

Professors of Digital Humanities, Bethany Nowviskie and Miriam Posner have blogged about the structures in place that have kept women from engaging in digital humanities. There have been efforts to increase the racial representations within the field as well. These feminist digital humanities projects include #transformDH, That Camp Theory, [[Critical code studies|Critical Code Studies]], and [[Crunk Feminist Collective]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crunkfeministcollective.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Bailey| first= Moya Z.|title=All the Digital Humanists Are White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave| journal=Journal of Digital Humanities| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black Girls Code]] is a project that has recently garnered attention, with founder [[Kimberly Bryant (technologist)|Kimberly Bryant]] receiving a Standing O-vation presented by Toyota and [[Oprah Winfrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Shumaker | first=Laura|title= "Oprah gives San Francisco’s Kimberly Bryant a Standing O-vation"| journal=SFGate| year=2014|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/lshumaker/2014/11/17/oprah-gives-san-franciscos-kimberly-bryant-a-standing-o-vation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archiving==
One goal of feminist literary scholars has been to increase the scope of women's literary works in visible archives. [http://orlando.cambridge.org/ The Orlando Project] and [[Women Writers Project|The Women Writers Project]] are two early projects that undertook the task of filling in the gaps that existed in literary history in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Dig. Humanities"&gt;{{cite article|last=Wernimont | first=Jacqueline |title=Whence Feminism? Assessing Feminist Interventions in Digital Literary Archives | journal=Digital Humanities Quarterly | publisher=The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations |year=2013 |url=http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000156/000156.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both efforts sought to use the electronic format "to overcome the problems of inaccessibility and scarcity which had rendered women’s writing invisible for so long."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwp.brown.edu/about/history/|title=WWP has moved|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dig. Humanities" /&gt;
One critique of a content-oriented approach to combating the marginalization of women's literary works is that it's simply not enough to add content to a system that is built upon a patriarchal methodology. "Literary scholars who depend on archival or rare book materials still confront, whether they acknowledge it or not, the legacy of an institutional form through which patriarchal power exercised the authority to determine value, classification, and access."&lt;ref name="Dig. Humanities" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13115">In social science '''foodways''' are the [[culture|cultural]], [[society|social]], and [[economics|economic]] practices relating to the production and consumption of [[food]].
Foodways often refers to the intersection of food in culture, traditions, and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Darnton|first=Julia|title=Foodways: When food meets culture and history|url=http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/foodways_when_food_meets_culture_and_history|website=Michigan State University Extension|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/F/FO014.html |work=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |title= Foodways}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition and Historical Overview ==

The ''[[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary'' defines Foodways as "the eating habits and culinary practices of a people, region, or historical period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary|title=foodways:}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ′foodways′ appears to have been coined in 1942 by three University of Chicago graduate students, John W. Bennett, Harvey L. Smith and Herbert Passim. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rachellaudan.com/2017/02/19542.html|title=Foodways and Ways of Talking about Food}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s, agricultural scientists and rural sociologists, usually under the auspices of the United States Department of Agriculture, had undertaken various studies of food habits of the rural poor, with the aim of improving them. With the advent of World War II, these efforts increased. Those with information to share about different food habits were encouraged to contact the anthropologist Margaret Mead at the National Research Council. 

It was in these circumstances that John W. Bennett and his companions went to study Anglo-Americans, German-Americans and African-Americans in the fertile but frequently flooded bottomlands of southern Illinois along the banks of the Mississippi. All depended on white bread, pork, and potatoes. To the investigators these habits, particularly the spurning of plentiful, nutritious foods such as fish, seemed irrational. They argued "The illusion of an 'economic man,' searching out the most obscure foodstuffs from an unwilling Nature in the reasoned pursuit of complete fulfillment of his needs, must give way to the concept of a man conditioned by the preferences and prejudices of his neighbors, selecting only those foods sanctioned by the 'culture.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last==Bennett |first=John |first2=Harvey L. |last2=Smith |first3=Herbert |last3=Passim |last-author-amp=yes |date=October 1942 |title=Food and Culture in Southern Illinois–A Preliminary Report |journal= [[American Sociological Review]] |volume =7|p=645}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably they chose the term 'foodways' by analogy with the term 'folkways.' This had gained currency in the United States following its adoption by Yale professor and pioneering social scientist William Graham Sumnner. &lt;ref&gt;Folkways: A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals (1906).&lt;/ref&gt; Since folkways were established by use, not reason, they were resistant to change and not easily altered by government intervention. Similarly, Bennett et al. concluded, foodways were not likely to change in just because bureaucrats suggested that new ways had economic or nutritional benefits. 

The term 'foodways' was little used until late 1960s and early 1970s and the surge in folklife research, including the establishment of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in 1967. As the field of Foodways develops, scholars offer their own definitions: "Contemporary scholarship defines foodways as the study of what we eat, as well as how and why and under what circumstances we eat it. As folklorist Jay Anderson argued in a pioneering 1971 essay, foodways encompasses “the whole interrelated system of food conceptualization and evaluation, procurement, preservation, preparation, consumption and nutrition shared by all the members of a particular society. This broad definition embraces both historical and regional differences while simultaneously pointing to the importance of food events (barbecues, Brunswick stew suppers, oyster roasts), food processes (ham curing, snap-bean canning, friend apple pie making), and even the aesthetic realms that touch upon the world of food (country songs about food, quilts raffled at community fish fries, literary references to eating)." - John T. Edge &lt;ref&gt; John Egerton, and Ann Bleidt Egerton. Southern Food: At Home, on the Road, in History. New York: Knopf :, 1987. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Social science ==

Anthropologists, folklorists, sociologists, historians, and food scholars often use the term foodways to describe the study of why we eat what we eat and what it means.  The term, therefore, looks at food consumption on a deeper than concrete level and includes, yet goes, beyond sustenance, recipes, and/or taste. Thus, according to Harris, Lyon and McLaughlin: “…everything about eating including what we consume, how we acquire it, who prepares it and who’s at the table – is a form of communication rich with meaning.  Our attitudes, practices and rituals around food are a window onto our most basic beliefs about the world and ourselves.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Patricia |last2=Lyon |first2=David |last3=McLaughlin |first3=Sue |date=2005 |title=The Meaning of Food|location= CT|publisher= The Globe Pequot Press|pages=VIII-IX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics like social inclusion and exclusion, power, and sense making are explored under the umbrella term foodways. Furthermore, the ways in which food shapes and is shaped by social organization are essential to examination of foodways.  Since consumption of food is socially constructed, cultural study is also incorporated in the term.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Anthropologist Mary Douglas, explains: “A very modest life of subsistence contrasts with our own use of goods, in for example, the use of food. How would we be able to say all of the things we want to say, even just to the members of our families, about different kinds of events and occasions and possibilities if we did not make any difference between breakfast and lunch and dinner and if we made no difference between Sunday and weekends, and never had a different kind of meal when friends came in, and if Christmas Day had also to be celebrated with the same kind of food?” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Douglas |first=Mary |editor-last=Hargreaves |editor-first=Shaun |editor-last2=Ross |editor-first2=Agus |date=1992 |title=Why Do People Want Goods? |journal= Understanding the Enterprise Culture |publisher= Edinburgh University Press |page= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in fields like anthropology, the production, procurement, preparation, presentation, and consumption of foods have always been regarded as central in the study of cultures&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal|author=Lévi-Strauss, Claude |date=1983|title=[[The Raw and the Cooked]]|journal= [[Mythologiques]] |volume =1|edition= Paperback Reprint |location= Chicago|publisher= University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of the term foodways in popular culture is used as an oriented way of looking at food practices.  In this sense, the term is a consumer culture expression that encompasses, in popularly understandable and debatable formats, contemporaneous social practices related to foods as well as nutritional and culinary aspects of foods.

== Regional aspects ==

The term foodways can be employed when referencing the "ways of food" of a region or location. For example:
*The Foodways Section of the [[American Folklore Society]] and the Department of Popular Culture at [[Bowling Green State University]] release an annual publication called ''Digest: An Interdisciplinary Study of Food and Foodways''. In addition to scholarly articles, this annual compendium offers reports of works in progress on foodways.  These include photo essays, course syllabi, and announcements.  Also found here are reviews of books, periodicals, conferences, exhibits, festivals, museums, and films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://afsnet.org/sections/foodways/digest.htm |title=Digest: An Interdisciplinary Study of Food and Foodways|publisher=American Folklore Society: Foodways Section|author=Department of Popular Culture at Bowling Green State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The website ''[[Michigan Foodways]]'' is devoted to "exhibitions and public programs focused on Michigan's unique contributions to the national culinary tapestry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=MichiganFoodways.org|url=http://www.michiganfoodways.org/|title=Michigan Foodways}} &lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Mystic Seaport Museum]] in Connecticut published the book ''Saltwater Foodways'', focusing on the foods of New Englanders.  It examines the population's behavior as seafaring people and when ashore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mystic Seaport Museum|location=CT|url=http://foodhistorynews.com/saltwater.html|title=Saltwater Foodways}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Colonial Williamsburg]] has a foodways staff dedicated to studying and recreating the foodways and practices of historical Williamsburg's upper class.  "The foodways team prepares dishes served to the colony's upper class because so much historical information about their culinary life is available, said Frank Clark, foodways supervisor and Colonial Williamsburg's first journeyman cook. Historians know far less about food practices of people further down the social scale, but cookbooks, documents, kitchen inventories, and archaeological research provide a detailed picture about how the governor and the gentry dined." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=History.org|url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/autumn04/food.cfm|title=Food|date=Autumn 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Southern Foodways Alliance]] explores the foodways of the [[American South]] via [[oral history]] projects, films, sharing of recipes, and promoting the teaching of foods and cultures of the region.  Their website also links to that of the University of Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southernfoodways.com/ |website=SouthernFoodways.com|title=Southern Foodways Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigrant foodways are also featured prominently in America. For example, The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, located in Southeastern Massachusetts - which has a very large immigrant population from Cape Verde - describes Cape Verdean Foodways by publishing recipes from these southern Atlantic islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=University of Massachusetts at Dartmoth|url=http://www.umassd.edu/SpecialPrograms/caboverde/cvrecipes.html|title=Cape Verdean Recipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarly approaches ==
In contrast to the anthropological treatments of food, the term foodways aims at a highly cross-disciplinary approach to food and nutrition. For example, the refereed journal ''Food and Foodways'', published by Taylor &amp; Francis, is "devoted to publishing original scholarly articles on the history and culture of human nourishment. By reflecting on the role food plays in human relations, this unique journal explores the powerful but often subtle ways in which food has shaped, and shapes, our lives socially, economically, politically, mentally, nutritionally, and morally. Because food is a pervasive social phenomenon, it cannot be approached by any one discipline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|website=researchgate.net|url=https://www.researchgate.net/journal/0740-9710_Food_and_Foodways|title=Food and Foodways}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In consumer culture research, contemporary and postmodern foodways are topics of interest. In an article in the journal ''Consumption Markets &amp; Culture'', from Taylor &amp; Francis publications, Douglas Brownlie, Paul Hewer, and Suzanne Horne explore culinary consumptionscapes through  a study of contemporary cookbooks, with chic recipes often turning intensely into a kind of "gastroporn", creating a "simulacrum of desire" as well as a "simulacrum of satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brownlie |first1=Douglas |last2=Hewer |first2=Paul |last3=Horne |first3=Suzanne |date=March 2005 |title=Culinary Tourism: An Exploratory Reading of Contemporary Representations of Cooking |journal=Consumption, Markets and Culture |volume= 8|pages= 7-26 |url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/10253866.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical studies of foodways help scientists, anthropologists, and scholars gain insight into past cultures. Springer Publishing has released the book, ''Pre-Columbian Foodways'', by John Staller and Michael Carrasco, which studies and examines "the symbolic complexity of food and its preparation, as well as the social importance of feasting in contemporary and historical societies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.springer.com/social+sciences/anthropology+%26+archaeology/book/978-1-4419-0470-6 |title=Pre-Columbian Foodways |last=Staller |first=John |last2=Carrasco |first2=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Books like this help further the study of foodways and increase public awareness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5439">'''Heroic virtue''' is a phrase coined by [[Augustine of Hippo]] to describe the [[virtue ethics|virtue]] of early [[Christian]] martyrs and used by the [[Catholic Church]].  The Greek pagan term [[hero]] described a person with possibly superhuman abilities and great goodness, and "it connotes a degree of bravery, fame, and distinction which places a man high above his fellows".&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia of 1917&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was later applied to other highly virtuous persons who do extraordinary good works.

Heroic virtue is one of the requirements for [[beatification]] in the Catholic Church.  The modern process for declaring heroic virtue is internal to the church and conducted by those in senior positions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Quoting the Catholic view  from the article on Heroic Virtue by J. Wilhelm in the 1917 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Together with the four [[cardinal virtues]] the Christian saint must be endowed with the [[three theological virtues]], especially with Divine [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], the virtue which informs all other virtues.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As charity stands at the summit of all virtues, so [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] stands at their foundation. For by faith God is first apprehended, and the soul lifted up to supernatural life. Faith is the secret of one's conscience; to the world it is made manifest by the good works in which it lives, "Faith without works is dead" (James 2:2). Such works are: the external profession of faith, strict observance of the Divine commands, [[prayer]], filial devotion to the Church, the [[fear of God (religion)|fear of God]], the horror of sin, [[penance]] for sins committed, patience in adversity, etc. All or any of these attain the grade of heroicity when practiced with unflagging perseverance, during a long period of time, or under circumstances so trying that by them men of but ordinary perfection would be deterred from acting.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Hope (virtue)|Hope]] is a firm trust that God will give us eternal life and all the means necessary to obtain it; it attains heroicity when it amounts to unshakeable confidence and security in God's help throughout all the untoward events of life, when it is ready to forsake and sacrifice all other goods in order to obtain the promised felicity of heaven.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Charity inclines man to love God above all things with the love of friendship. The perfect friend of God says with St. Paul: "With Christ I am nailed to the cross. And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in me" (Galatians 2:19-20). For love means union. Its type in heaven is the Divine Trinity in Unity; its highest degree in God's creatures is the [[beatific vision]], i.e. participation in God's life. On earth it is the fruitful mother of holiness, the one thing necessary, the one all-sufficient possession. It is extolled in I Cor., xiii, and in St. John's Gospel and Epistles; the beloved disciple and the fiery missionary of the cross are the best interpreters of the mystery of love revealed to them in the [[Sacred Heart|Heart of Jesus]]. With the commandment to love God above all Jesus coupled another: "And the second is like to it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these" (Mark 12:31). The likeness, or the linking of the two commandments, lies in this: that in our neighbor we love God's image and likeness, His adopted children and the heirs of His Kingdom. Hence, serving our neighbor is serving God. And the works of spiritual and temporal mercy performed in this world will decide our fate in the next: "Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom. . .For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat. . .Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me" ({{bibleref|Matthew|25:34–40}}).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Prudence]], which enables us to know what to desire or to avoid, attains heroicity when it coincides with the "gift of counsel", i.e. a clear, Divinely aided insight into right and wrong conduct.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Justice]], which gives every one his due, is the pivot on which turn the virtues of religion, piety, obedience, gratitude, truthfulness, friendship, and many more. Jesus sacrificing His life to give God His due, [[Abraham]] willing to sacrifice his son in obedience to God's will, these are acts of heroic justice.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Courage|Fortitude]], which urges us on when difficulty stands in the way of our duty, is itself the heroic element in the practice of virtue; it reaches its apex when it overcomes obstacles which to ordinary virtue are insurmountable.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]], which restrains us when passions urge us to what is wrong, comprises becoming deportment, modesty, abstinence, chastity, sobriety, and others.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''In fine'' it should be remarked that almost every act of virtue proceeding from the Divine principle within us has in it the elements of all the virtues; only mental analysis views the same act under various aspects.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[psychology]], [[heuristics]] are simple, efficient rules which people often use to form judgments and [[Decision-making|make decisions]]. They are mental shortcuts that usually involve focusing on one aspect of a complex problem and ignoring others.&lt;ref name="Lewis2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Alan|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Psychology and Economic Behaviour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKcG5H0zXwYC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=7 February 2013|date=17 April 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85665-2|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Lori A.|title=CliffsAP Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIE6idG8jFgC&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=7 February 2013|date=21 May 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-19718-9|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nevid2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nevid|first=Jeffrey S.|title=Psychology: Concepts and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LsVK0kSpzx8C&amp;pg=PA251|accessdate=7 February 2013|date=1 October 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-547-14814-4|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rules work well under most circumstances, but they can lead to systematic deviations from [[logic]], [[probability]] or [[rational choice theory]]. The resulting errors are called "[[cognitive bias]]es" and many different types have been documented. These have been shown to affect people's choices in situations like valuing a house, deciding the outcome of a legal case, or making an investment decision. Heuristics usually govern automatic, [[Intuition|intuitive judgments]] but can also be used as deliberate mental strategies when working from limited information.

Cognitive scientist [[Herbert A. Simon]] originally proposed that human judgments are limited by available information, time constraints, and cognitive limitations, calling this [[bounded rationality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bazerman| first=M.

These findings set in motion the heuristics and biases research program,&lt;ref name="KahnemanKlein2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|last2=Klein|first2=Gary|title=Conditions for intuitive expertise: A failure to disagree|journal=American Psychologist|volume=64|issue=6|year=2009|pages=515–526|doi=10.1037/a0016755|pmid=19739881}}&lt;/ref&gt; which studies how people make real-world judgments and the conditions under which those judgments are unreliable. This research challenged the idea that human beings are rational actors, but provided a theory of information processing to explain how people make estimates or choices. This research, which first gained worldwide attention in 1974 with the ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' paper "[[#CITEREFTverskyKahneman1974|Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases]]",&lt;ref name=Kahneman2011&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|title=Thinking, Fast and Slow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuKTvERuPG8C|year=2011|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-1-4299-6935-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; has guided almost all current theories of decision-making,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plous|1999|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although the originally proposed heuristics have been challenged in the further debate, this research program has changed the field by permanently setting the research questions.&lt;ref name=FiedlerSydow2015&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fiedler |first1=Klaus|last2=von Sydow|first2=Momme |editor-last1=Eysenck |editor-first1=Michael W.|editor-last2=Groome|editor-first2=David |title=Cognitive Psychology: Revising the Classical Studies |publisher=Sage, London |date=2015|pages=146–161 |chapter=Heuristics and Biases: Beyond Tversky and Kahneman's (1974) Judgment under Uncertainty |chapterurl=http://crisp.psi.uni-heidelberg.de/sites/default/files/vonSydow/Fiedler__von_Sydow_2015_Heuristic_and_biases_Beyond_Tversky__Kahneman_s_1974_In__Eysenck_Groome_Ch_12.pdf |isbn=978-1-4462-9447-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This heuristics-and-biases tradition has been criticised by [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and others for being too focused on how heuristics lead to errors.&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gigerenzer|first1=G.|title=On narrow norms and vague heuristics: A reply to Kahneman and Tversky |journal=[[Psychological Review]]|volume=103|issue=3|year=1996|pages=592–596|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.592}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics argue that heuristics can be seen as rational in an underlying sense. According to this perspective, heuristics are good enough for most purposes without being too demanding on the brain's resources. Another theoretical perspective sees heuristics as fully rational in that they are rapid, can be made without full information and can be as accurate as more complicated procedures. By understanding the role of heuristics in human psychology, marketers and other persuaders can influence decisions, such as the prices people pay for goods or the quantity they buy.

==Types==

In their initial research, Tversky and Kahneman proposed three heuristics—availability, representativeness, and anchoring and adjustment. Subsequent work has identified many more. Heuristics that underlie judgment are called "judgment heuristics". Another type, called "evaluation heuristics", are used to judge the desirability of possible choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Hastie|Dawes|2009|pp=210–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Availability===
{{main|Availability heuristic}}
In psychology, ''availability'' is the ease with which a particular idea can be brought to mind. When people estimate how likely or how frequent an event is on the basis of its availability, they are using the availability heuristic.&lt;ref name="tkavail"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Tversky |first1=Amos |last2= Kahneman |first2=Daniel |year=1973 |title=Availability: A Heuristic for Judging Frequency and Probability |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=5 |pages=207–232|issn=0010-0285|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(73)90033-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an infrequent event can be brought easily and vividly to mind, people tend to overestimate its likelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morewedge|first1=Carey K.|last2=Todorov|first2=Alexander|title=The Least Likely Act: Overweighting Atypical Past Behavior in Behavioral Predictions|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|date=24 January 2012|volume=3|issue=6|pages=760–766|doi=10.1177/1948550611434784}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, people overestimate their likelihood of dying in a dramatic event such as a [[tornado]] or [[terrorism]]. Dramatic, violent deaths are usually more highly publicised and therefore have a higher availability.&lt;ref name="suther_avail"&gt;{{harvnb|Sutherland|2007|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, common but mundane events are hard to bring to mind, so their likelihoods tend to be underestimated. These include deaths from [[suicide]]s, [[stroke]]s, and [[diabetes]]. This heuristic is one of the reasons why people are more easily swayed by a single, vivid story than by a large body of statistical evidence.&lt;ref name="plous_avail" /&gt; It may also play a role in the appeal of [[Lottery|lotteries]]: to someone buying a ticket, the well-publicised, jubilant winners are more available than the millions of people who have won nothing.&lt;ref name="suther_avail" /&gt;

When people judge whether more [[English language|English]] words begin with ''T'' or with ''K'', the availability heuristic gives a quick way to answer the question. Words that begin with ''T'' come more readily to mind, and so subjects give a correct answer without counting out large numbers of words. However, this heuristic can also produce errors. When people are asked whether there are more English words with ''K'' in the first position or with ''K'' in the third position, they use the same process. It is easy to think of words that begin with ''K'', such as ''kangaroo'', ''kitchen'', or ''kept''. It is harder to think of words with ''K'' as the third letter, such as ''lake'', or ''acknowledge'', although objectively these are three times more common. This leads people to the incorrect conclusion that ''K'' is more common at the start of words.&lt;ref name="tk1974" &gt;{{harvnb|Tversky|Kahneman|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another experiment, subjects heard the names of many celebrities, roughly equal numbers of whom were male and female. The subjects were then asked whether the list of names included more men or more women. When the men in the list were more famous, a great majority of subjects incorrectly thought there were more of them, and vice versa for women. Tversky and Kahneman's interpretation of these results is that judgments of proportion are based on availability, which is higher for the names of better-known people.&lt;ref name="tkavail" /&gt;

In one experiment that occurred before the [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976 U.S. Presidential election]], some participants were asked to imagine [[Gerald Ford]] winning, while others did the same for a [[Jimmy Carter]] victory. Each group subsequently viewed their allocated candidate as significantly more likely to win. The researchers found a similar effect when students imagined a good or a bad season for a [[college football]] team.&lt;ref name="Carroll1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=J.|title=The Effect of Imagining an Event on Expectations for the Event: An Interpretation in Terms of the Availability Heuristic|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=14|issue=1|year=1978|pages=88–96|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(78)90062-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of imagination on subjective likelihood has been replicated by several other researchers.&lt;ref name="plous_avail"&gt;{{harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A concept's availability can be affected by how recently and how frequently it has been brought to mind. In one study, subjects were given partial sentences to complete. The words were selected to activate the concept either of hostility or of kindness: a process known as ''[[priming (psychology)|priming]]''. They then had to interpret the behavior of a man described in a short, ambiguous story. Their interpretation was biased towards the emotion they had been primed with: the more priming, the greater the effect. A greater interval between the initial task and the judgment decreased the effect.&lt;ref name="SrullWyer1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Srull|first1=Thomas K.|last2=Wyer|first2=Robert S.|title=The Role of Category Accessibility in the Interpretation of Information About Persons: Some Determinants and Implications|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=37|issue=10|year=1979|pages=1660–1672|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.37.10.1660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tversky and Kahneman offered the availability heuristic as an explanation for [[illusory correlation]]s in which people wrongly judge two events to be associated with each other. They explained that people judge correlation on the basis of the ease of imagining or recalling the two events together.&lt;ref name="tkavail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tk1974" /&gt;

===Representativeness===
{{main|Representativeness heuristic}}
The representativeness heuristic is seen when people use categories, for example when deciding whether or not a person is a criminal. An individual thing has a high ''representativeness'' for a category if it is very similar to a prototype of that category. When people categorise things on the basis of representativeness, they are using the representativeness heuristic. "Representative" is here meant in two different senses: the prototype used for comparison is representative of its category, and representativeness is also a relation between that prototype and the thing being categorised.&lt;ref name="tk1974" /&gt;&lt;ref name="plous_repres"&gt;{{harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=109–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is effective for some problems, this heuristic involves attending to the particular characteristics of the individual, ignoring how common those categories are in the population (called the ''base rates''). Thus, people can overestimate the likelihood that something has a very rare property, or underestimate the likelihood of a very common property. This is called the [[base rate fallacy]]. Representativeness explains this and several other ways in which human judgments break the laws of probability.&lt;ref name="tk1974" /&gt;

The representativeness heuristic is also an explanation of how people judge cause and effect: when they make these judgements on the basis of similarity, they are also said to be using the representativeness heuristic. This can lead to a bias, incorrectly finding causal relationships between things that resemble one another and missing them when the cause and effect are very different. Examples of this include both the belief that "emotionally relevant events ought to have emotionally relevant causes", and magical [[associative thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Richard E.|last1= Nisbett |last2= Ross|first2=Lee|title=Human inference: strategies and shortcomings of social judgment|year=1980|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|isbn=9780134450735|pages=115–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ignorance of base rates====
{{main|Base rate fallacy}}
A 1973 experiment used a psychological profile of Tom W., a fictional graduate student.&lt;ref name="ktprediction"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |author2=Amos Tversky |date=July 1973 |title=On the Psychology of Prediction |journal=Psychological Review |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=237–251 |issn= 0033-295X |doi=10.1037/h0034747}}&lt;/ref&gt; One group of subjects had to rate Tom's similarity to a typical student in each of nine academic areas (including Law, Engineering and Library Science). Another group had to rate how likely it is that Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by probability, then they should resemble the [[base rates]], i.e. the proportion of students in each of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). If people based their judgments on probability, they would say that Tom is more likely to study Humanities than Library Science, because there are many more Humanities students, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.&lt;ref name="ktprediction" /&gt;

====Conjunction fallacy====
{{main|Conjunction fallacy}}
When people rely on representativeness, they can fall into an error which breaks a fundamental law of [[probability]].&lt;ref name="plous_repres" /&gt; Tversky and Kahneman gave subjects a short character sketch of a woman called Linda, describing her as, "31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations". People reading this description then ranked the likelihood of different statements about Linda. Amongst others, these included "Linda is a bank teller", and, "Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement". People showed a strong tendency to rate the latter, more specific statement as more likely, even though a conjunction of the form "Linda is both ''X'' and ''Y''" can never be more probable than the more general statement "Linda is ''X''". The explanation in terms of heuristics is that the judgment was distorted because, for the readers, the character sketch was representative of the sort of person who might be an active feminist but not of someone who works in a bank. A similar exercise concerned Bill, described as "intelligent but unimaginative". A great majority of people reading this character sketch rated "Bill is an accountant who plays jazz for a hobby", as more likely than "Bill plays jazz for a hobby".&lt;ref name="tkconjunction"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|author2=Kahneman, Daniel|title=Extensional versus intuitive reasoning: The conjunction fallacy in probability judgment.|journal=Psychological Review|year=1983|volume=90|issue=4|pages=293–315|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.90.4.293}}  reprinted in {{Citation |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment|editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-last=Gilovich |editor2-first= Dale |editor2-last=Griffin |editor3-first= Daniel |editor3-last=Kahneman |publisher =Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=19–48  |isbn=9780521796798 |oclc=47364085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without success, Tversky and Kahneman used what they described as "a series of increasingly desperate manipulations" to get their subjects to recognise the logical error. In one variation, subjects had to choose between a logical explanation of why "Linda is a bank teller" is more likely, and a deliberately illogical [[argument]] which said that "Linda is a feminist bank teller" is more likely "because she resembles an active feminist more than she resembles a bank teller". Sixty-five percent of subjects found the illogical argument more convincing.&lt;ref name="tkconjunction" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Poundstone|2010|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other researchers also carried out variations of this study, exploring the possibility that people had misunderstood the question. They did not eliminate the error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tentori|first=K.|author2=Bonini, N. |author3=Osherson, D. |title=The conjunction fallacy: a misunderstanding about conjunction?|journal=Cognitive Science|date=1 May 2004|volume=28|issue=3|pages=467–477|doi=10.1016/j.cogsci.2004.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moro|first=Rodrigo|title=On the nature of the conjunction fallacy|journal=Synthese|date=29 July 2008|volume=171|issue=1|pages=1–24|doi=10.1007/s11229-008-9377-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that individuals with high [[Cognitive reflection test|CRT scores]] are significantly less likely to be subject to the conjunction fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oechssler|first=Jörg|last2=Roider|first2=Andreas|last3=Schmitz|first3=Patrick W.|date=2009|title=Cognitive abilities and behavioral biases|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2009.04.018|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=72|issue=1|pages=147–152|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2009.04.018|issn=0167-2681|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The error disappears when the question is posed in terms of frequencies. Everyone in these versions of the study recognised that out of 100 people fitting an outline description, the conjunction statement ("She is ''X'' and ''Y''") cannot apply to more people than the general statement ("She is ''X''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gigerenzer | first1 = Gerd | year = 1991 | title = How to make cognitive illusions disappear: Beyond "heuristics and biases | url = | journal = European Review of Social Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 83–115 | doi = 10.1080/14792779143000033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- I think Tversky &amp; Kahneman discovered this before Gigerenzer- ref to come --&gt;

====Ignorance of sample size====
{{Main|Insensitivity to sample size}}
Tversky and Kahneman asked subjects to consider a problem about random variation. Imagining for simplicity that exactly half of the babies born in a hospital are male, the ratio will not be exactly half in every time period. On some days, more girls will be born and on others, more boys. The question was, does the likelihood of deviating from exactly half depend on whether there are many or few births per day? It is a well-established consequence of [[sampling (statistics)|sampling theory]] that proportions will vary much more day-to-day when the typical number of births per day is small. However, people's answers to the problem do not reflect this fact. They typically reply that the number of births in the hospital makes no difference to the likelihood of more than 60% male babies in one day. The explanation in terms of the heuristic is that people consider only how representative the figure of 60% is of the previously given average of 50%.&lt;ref name="tk1974" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Kunda |1999 |pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dilution effect====
[[Richard E. Nisbett]] and colleagues suggest that representativeness explains the ''dilution effect'', in which irrelevant information weakens the effect of a [[stereotype]]. Subjects in one study were asked whether "Paul" or "Susan" was more likely to be assertive, given no other information than their first names. They rated Paul as more assertive, apparently basing their judgment on a gender stereotype. Another group, told that Paul's and Susan's mothers each commute to work in a bank, did not show this stereotype effect; they rated Paul and Susan as equally assertive. The explanation is that the additional information about Paul and Susan made them less representative of men or women in general, and so the subjects' expectations about men and women had a weaker effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Kunda |1999| pp=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means unrelated and non-diagnostic information about certain issue can make relative information less powerful to the issue when people understand the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Zukier1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zukier|first1=Henry|title=The dilution effect: The role of the correlation and the dispersion of predictor variables in the use of nondiagnostic information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=43|issue=6|year=1982|pages=1163–1174|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.6.1163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Misperception of randomness====
Representativeness explains systematic errors that people make when judging the probability of random events. For example, in a sequence of coin tosses, each of which comes up heads (H) or tails (T), people reliably tend to judge a clearly patterned sequence such as HHHTTT as less likely than a less patterned sequence such as HTHTTH. These sequences have exactly the same probability, but people tend to see the more clearly patterned sequences as less representative of randomness, and so less likely to result from a random process.&lt;ref name="tk1974"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Kunda |1999 |pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tversky and Kahneman argued that this effect underlies the [[gambler's fallacy]]; a tendency to expect outcomes to even out over the short run, like expecting a [[roulette]] wheel to come up black because the last several throws came up red.&lt;ref name="plous_repres" /&gt;&lt;ref name="smallnumbers"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|author2=Kahneman, Daniel|title=Belief in the law of small numbers.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year= 1971|volume=76|issue=2|pages=105–110|doi=10.1037/h0031322}} reprinted in {{cite book|editor1=Daniel Kahneman |editor2=Paul Slovic |editor3=Amos Tversky |title=Judgment under uncertainty: heuristics and biases|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521284141|pages=23–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasised that even experts in statistics were susceptible to this illusion: in a 1971 survey of professional psychologists, they found that respondents expected samples to be overly representative of the population they were drawn from. As a result, the psychologists systematically overestimated the [[statistical power]] of their tests, and underestimated the [[sample size]] needed for a meaningful test of their hypotheses.&lt;ref name="tk1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smallnumbers" /&gt;

===Anchoring and adjustment===
{{main|Anchoring}}
Anchoring and adjustment is a heuristic used in many situations where people estimate a number.&lt;ref name="baron_anch"&gt;{{harvnb|Baron|2000|p=235?}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tversky and Kahneman's original description, it involves starting from a readily available number—the "anchor"—and shifting either up or down to reach an answer that seems plausible.&lt;ref name=baron_anch /&gt; In Tversky and Kahneman's experiments, people did not shift far enough away from the anchor. Hence the anchor contaminates the estimate, even if it is clearly irrelevant. In one experiment, subjects watched a number being selected from a spinning "wheel of fortune". They had to say whether a given quantity was larger or smaller than that number. For instance, they might be asked, "Is the percentage of African countries which are members of the [[United Nations]] larger or smaller than 65%?" They then tried to guess the true percentage. Their answers correlated well with the arbitrary number they had been given.&lt;ref name=baron_anch /&gt;&lt;ref name=plous_anch /&gt;  Insufficient adjustment from an anchor is not the only explanation for this effect. An alternative theory is that people form their estimates on evidence which is selectively brought to mind by the anchor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Koehler|Harvey|2004|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cote de Brouilly bottle of Beaujolais wine.jpg|thumb|160px|The amount of money people will pay in an auction for a bottle of wine can be influenced by considering an arbitrary two-digit number.]]

The anchoring effect has been demonstrated by a wide variety of experiments both in laboratories and in the real world.&lt;ref name=plous_anch /&gt;&lt;ref name=mes197 /&gt; It remains when the subjects are offered money as an incentive to be accurate, or when they are explicitly told not to base their judgment on the anchor.&lt;ref name="mes197"&gt;{{Harvnb |Mussweiler|Englich|Strack|2004|pp=185–186, 197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is stronger when people have to make their judgments quickly.&lt;ref name=yud_anch /&gt; Subjects in these experiments lack [[introspection|introspective awareness]] of the heuristic, denying that the anchor affected their estimates.&lt;ref name=yud_anch /&gt;

Even when the anchor value is obviously random or extreme, it can still contaminate estimates.&lt;ref name=mes197 /&gt; One experiment asked subjects to estimate the year of [[Albert Einstein]]'s first visit to the United States. Anchors of 1215 and 1992 contaminated the answers just as much as more sensible anchor years.&lt;ref name="yud_anch"&gt;{{Harvnb |Yudkowsky|2008|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experiments asked subjects if the average temperature in [[San Francisco]] is more or less than 558 degrees, or whether there had been more or fewer than 100,025 top ten albums by [[The Beatles]]. These deliberately absurd anchors still affected estimates of the true numbers.&lt;ref name="plous_anch"&gt;{{harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anchoring results in a particularly strong bias when estimates are stated in the form of a [[confidence interval]]. An example is where people predict the value of a stock market index on a particular day by defining an upper and lower bound so that they are 98% confident the true value will fall in that range. A reliable finding is that people anchor their upper and lower bounds too close to their best estimate.&lt;ref name="tk1974" /&gt; This leads to an [[overconfidence effect]]. One much-replicated finding is that when people are 98% certain that a number is in a particular range, they are wrong about thirty to forty percent of the time.&lt;ref name=tk1974 /&gt;&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{citation|last=Lichtenstein |first=Sarah |first2=Baruch |last2=Fischoff|first3= Lawrence D. |last3=Phillips |chapter=Calibration of probabilities: The state of the art to 1980 |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Kahneman| editor2-first=Paul|editor2-last=Slovic |editor3-first=Amos|editor3-last=Tversky |title=Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1982 |isbn= 9780521284141 |pages=306–334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anchoring also causes particular difficulty when many numbers are combined into a composite judgment. Tversky and Kahneman demonstrated this by asking a group of people to rapidly estimate the product 8&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;1. Another group had to estimate the same product in reverse order; 1&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;8. Both groups underestimated the answer by a wide margin, but the latter group's average estimate was significantly smaller.&lt;ref name=suther168 /&gt; The explanation in terms of anchoring is that people multiply the first few terms of each product and anchor on that figure.&lt;ref name=suther168 /&gt; A less abstract task is to estimate the probability that an aircraft will crash, given that there are numerous possible faults each with a likelihood of one in a million. A common finding from studies of these tasks is that people anchor on the small component probabilities and so underestimate the total.&lt;ref name="suther168"&gt;{{harvnb|Sutherland|2007|pp=168–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; A corresponding effect happens when people estimate the probability of multiple events happening in sequence, such as an [[Parlay (gambling)|accumulator bet]] in horse racing. For this kind of judgment, anchoring on the individual probabilities results in an overestimation of the combined probability.&lt;ref name=suther168 /&gt;

====Examples====
People's valuation of goods, and the quantities they buy, respond to anchoring effects. In one experiment, people wrote down the last two digits of their [[social security number]]s. They were then asked to consider whether they would pay this number of dollars for items whose value they did not know, such as wine, chocolate, and computer equipment. They then entered an [[auction]] to bid for these items.

Anchoring and adjustment has also been shown to affect grades given to students. In one experiment, 48 teachers were given bundles of student essays, each of which had to be graded and returned. They were also given a fictional list of the students' previous grades. The mean of these grades affected the grades that teachers awarded for the essay.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor1-first=Jean-Paul |editor1-last=Caverni |editor2-first= Jean-Marc |editor2-last=Fabré |editor3-first=Michel |editor3-last=González |publisher=Elsevier |title=Cognitive biases |year=1990|chapter=The Anchoring-Adjustment Heuristic in an 'Information-Rich, Real World Setting': Knowledge Assessment by Experts | first1=Jean-Paul |last1=Caverni|first2=Jean-Luc |last2=Péris|pages=35–45|isbn=9780444884138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study showed that anchoring affected the sentences in a fictional rape trial.&lt;ref name="mes183" /&gt; The subjects were trial judges with, on average, more than fifteen years of experience. They read documents including witness testimony, expert statements, the relevant penal code, and the final pleas from the prosecution and defence. The two conditions of this experiment differed in just one respect: the prosecutor demanded a 34-month sentence in one condition and 12 months in the other; there was an eight-month difference between the average sentences handed out in these two conditions.&lt;ref name="mes183"&gt;{{Harvnb |Mussweiler|Englich|Strack|2004|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar mock trial, the subjects took the role of jurors in a civil case. They were either asked to award damages "in the range from $15 million to $50 million" or "in the range from $50 million to $150 million". Although the facts of the case were the same each time, jurors given the higher range decided on an award that was about three times higher. This happened even though the subjects were explicitly warned not to treat the requests as evidence.&lt;ref name=HastieDawes_anch /&gt;

Assessments can also be influenced by the stimuli provided.  In one review, researchers found that if a stimuli is perceived to be important or carry "weight" to a situation, that people were more likely to attribute that stimuli as heavier physically.&lt;ref&gt;Rabelo, A. L., Keller, V. N., Pilati, R., &amp; Wicherts, J. M. (2015). No effect of weight on judgments of importance in the moral domain and evidence of publication bias from a meta-analysis.

===Affect heuristic===
{{main|Affect heuristic}}
"[[Affect (psychology)|Affect]]", in this context, is a [[emotion|feeling]] such as fear, pleasure or surprise. It is shorter in duration than a [[emotional mood|mood]], occurring rapidly and involuntarily in response to a [[stimulation|stimulus]]. While reading the words "lung cancer" might generate an affect of [[Fear|dread]], the words "mother's love" can create an affect of [[affection]] and comfort. When people use affect ("gut responses") to judge benefits or risks, they are using the affect heuristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finucane|first=M.L.|author2=Alhakami, A. |author3=Slovic, P. |author4=Johnson, S.M. |title=The Affect Heuristic in Judgment of Risks and Benefits|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date=January 2000|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0771(200001/03)13:1&lt;1::AID-BDM333&gt;3.0.CO;2-S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affect heuristic has been used to explain why messages [[framing (social sciences)|framed]] to activate emotions are more persuasive than those framed in a purely factual way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=Carmen |author2=Siegrist, Michael |author3=Gutscher, Heinz|title=The Role of Affect and Availability Heuristics in Risk Analysis|date=June 2006|volume=26|issue=3|pages=631–639|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.2006.00773.x|journal=Risk Analysis|pmid=16834623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
There are competing theories of human judgment, which differ on whether the use of heuristics is irrational. A ''cognitive laziness'' approach argues that heuristics are inevitable shortcuts given the limitations of the human brain. According to the ''natural assessments'' approach, some complex calculations are already done rapidly and automatically by the brain, and other judgments make use of these processes rather than calculating from scratch. This has led to a theory called "attribute substitution", which says that people often handle a complicated question by answering a different, related question, without being aware that this is what they are doing.&lt;ref name=revisited /&gt; A third approach argues that heuristics perform just as well as more complicated decision-making procedures, but more quickly and with less information. This perspective emphasises the "fast and frugal" nature of heuristics.&lt;ref name="Hardman_frugal"&gt;{{harvnb|Hardman|2009|pp=13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive laziness===
{{See also|Cognitive miser}}
An ''effort-reduction framework'' proposed by Anuj K. Shah and [[Daniel M. Oppenheimer]] states that people use a variety of techniques to reduce the effort of making decisions.&lt;ref name="shah2008"/&gt;

===Attribute substitution===
{{main|Attribute substitution}}
[[File:Opt taeuschung groesse.jpg|thumb|225px|right|A visual example of attribute substitution. This illusion works because the 2D size of parts of the scene is judged on the basis of 3D (perspective) size, which is rapidly calculated by the visual system.]]
In 2002 Daniel Kahneman and [[Shane Frederick]] proposed a process called attribute substitution which happens without conscious awareness. According to this theory, when somebody makes a judgment (of a ''target attribute'') which is computationally complex, a rather more easily calculated ''heuristic attribute'' is substituted.&lt;ref name="newell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Newell |first=Benjamin R. |author2=David A. Lagnado |author3=David R. Shanks  |title=Straight choices: the psychology of decision making |publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |pages=71–74 |isbn=9781841695884}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, a difficult problem is dealt with by answering a rather simpler problem, without the person being aware this is happening.&lt;ref name="revisited"&gt;{{Citation |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |first2=Shane |last2=Frederick |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-last=Gilovich |editor2-first= Dale |editor2-last=Griffin |editor3-first= Daniel |editor3-last=Kahneman |publisher =Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=49–81 |chapter=Representativeness   Revisited: Attribute Substitution in Intuitive Judgment |isbn=9780521796798 |oclc=47364085}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This explains why individuals can be unaware of their own biases, and why biases persist even when the subject is made aware of them. It also explains why human judgments often fail to show [[regression toward the mean]].&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|date=December 2003|title=Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics|journal=American Economic Review|publisher=American Economic Association|url=http://www.econ.tuwien.ac.at/lotto/papers/Kahneman2.pdf|volume=93|issue=5|pages=1449–1475|doi=10.1257/000282803322655392|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This substitution is thought of as taking place in the automatic ''intuitive'' judgment system, rather than the more self-aware ''reflective'' system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morewedge|first1=Carey K.|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|title=Associative processes in intuitive judgment|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=October 2010|volume=14|issue=10|pages=435–440|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.07.004|pmid=20696611|pmc=5378157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, when someone tries to answer a difficult question, they may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place.&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newell"/&gt;

In 1975, psychologist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] proposed that the strength of a stimulus (e.g. the [[Luminance|brightness]] of a light, the severity of a crime) is encoded by [[Neuron|brain cell]]s in a way that is independent of [[Stimulus modality|modality]]. Kahneman and Frederick built on this idea, arguing that the target attribute and heuristic attribute could be very different in nature.&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;

{{Quote box |quote=[P]eople are not accustomed to thinking hard, and are often content to trust a plausible judgment that comes to mind. |source=[[Daniel Kahneman]], ''American Economic Review'' '''93''' (5) December 2003, p. 1450&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer" /&gt; |width=30% |align=right}}
Kahneman and Frederick propose three conditions for attribute substitution:&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;
# The target attribute is relatively inaccessible.&lt;br /&gt;Substitution is not expected to take place in answering factual questions that can be retrieved directly from memory ("What is your birthday?") or about current experience ("Do you feel thirsty now?).
# An associated attribute is highly accessible.&lt;br /&gt;This might be because it is evaluated automatically in normal perception or because it has been [[priming (psychology)|primed]]. For example, someone who has been thinking about their love life and is then asked how happy they are might substitute how happy they are with their love life rather than other areas.
# The substitution is not detected and corrected by the reflective system.&lt;br /&gt;For example, when asked "A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?" many subjects incorrectly answer $0.10.&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|date=December 2003|title=Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics|journal=American Economic Review|publisher=American Economic Association|url=http://www.econ.tuwien.ac.at/lotto/papers/Kahneman2.pdf|volume=93|issue=5|pages=1449–1475|doi=10.1257/000282803322655392|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation in terms of attribute substitution is that, rather than work out the sum, subjects parse the sum of $1.10 into a large amount and a small amount, which is easy to do. Whether they feel that is the right answer will depend on whether they check the calculation with their reflective system.

Kahneman gives an example where some Americans were offered [[insurance]] against their own death in a terrorist attack while on a trip to Europe, while another group were offered insurance that would cover death of any kind on the trip. Even though "death of any kind" includes "death in a terrorist attack", the former group were willing to pay more than the latter. Kahneman suggests that the attribute of [[fear]] is being substituted for a calculation of the total risks of travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kahneman07/kahneman07_index.html |title=Short Course in Thinking About Thinking |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |year=2007 |work=Edge.org |publisher=Edge Foundation |accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of terrorism for these subjects was stronger than a general fear of dying on a foreign trip. See Morewedge and Kahneman (2010), for a recent summary of attribute substitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Fast and frugal===
[[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and colleagues have argued that heuristics can be used to make judgments that are accurate rather than biased. According to them, heuristics are "fast and frugal" alternatives to more complicated procedures, giving answers that are just as good.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Gigerenzer, Peter M. Todd, and the ABC Research Group (1999). ''Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart''. Oxford, UK, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-514381-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

===Efficient decision heuristics===
Warren Thorngate, an emeritus social psychologist, implemented 10 simple decision rules or heuristics in a simulation program as computer subroutines chose an alternative. He determined how often each heuristic selected alternatives with highest-through-lowest expected value in a series of randomly generated decision situations. He found that most of the simulated heuristics selected alternatives with highest expected value and almost never selected alternatives with lowest expected value. More information about the simulation can be found in his "Efficient decision heuristics" article (1980).&lt;ref name="Thorngate1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorngate|first1=Warren|title=Efficient decision heuristics|journal=Behavioral Science|volume=25|issue=3|year=1980|pages=219–225|doi=10.1002/bs.3830250306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Beautiful-is-familiar" effect===
Psychologist Benoît Monin reports a series of experiments in which subjects, looking at photographs of faces, have to judge whether they have seen those faces before. It is repeatedly found that attractive faces are more likely to be mistakenly labeled as familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Monin |first=Benoît |author2=Daniel M. Oppenheimer |year=2005 |title=Correlated Averages vs. Averaged Correlations: Demonstrating the Warm Glow Heuristic Beyond Aggregation |journal=Social Cognition |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=257–278 |issn=0278-016X |url=http://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/Opp%20Demonstrating%20the%20Warm%20Glow%20Heuristic.pdf |doi=10.1521/soco.2005.23.3.257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monin interprets this result in terms of attribute substitution. The heuristic attribute in this case is a "warm glow"; a positive feeling towards someone that might either be due to their being familiar or being attractive. This interpretation has been criticised, because not all the [[variance]] in familiarity is accounted for by the attractiveness of the photograph.&lt;ref name="shah2008"/&gt;

===Judgments of morality and fairness===
Legal scholar [[Cass Sunstein]] has argued that attribute substitution is pervasive when people reason about [[morality|moral]], [[political]] or [[legal]] matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2005 |title=Moral heuristics |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages= 531–542 |issn=0140-525X |doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000099 |pmid= 16209802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a difficult, novel problem in these areas, people search for a more familiar, related problem (a "prototypical case") and apply its solution as the solution to the harder problem. According to Sunstein, the opinions of trusted political or religious authorities can serve as heuristic attributes when people are asked their own opinions on a matter. Another source of heuristic attributes is [[emotion]]: people's moral opinions on sensitive subjects like [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[human cloning]] may be driven by reactions such as [[disgust]], rather than by reasoned principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2009 |title=Some Effects of Moral Indignation on Law |journal=Vermont Law Review |publisher=Vermont Law School |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=405–434 |url= http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/files/2012/02/12-Sunstein-Book-3-Vol.-33.pdf |ssrn=1401432|accessdate=2009-09-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129023946/http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/files/2012/02/12-Sunstein-Book-3-Vol.-33.pdf|archivedate=November 29, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunstein has been challenged as not providing enough evidence that attribute substitution, rather than other processes, is at work in these cases.&lt;ref name="shah2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shah |first=Anuj K. |author2=Daniel M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3586">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[topology]], the '''homeomorphism group''' of a [[topological space]] is the [[group (mathematics)|group]] consisting of all [[homeomorphism]]s from the space to itself with [[function composition]] as the group [[binary operation|operation]]. Homeomorphism groups are very important in the theory of topological spaces and in general are examples of [[automorphism group]]s. Homeomorphism groups are [[topological invariant]]s in the sense that the homeomorphism groups of homeomorphic topological spaces are [[Group isomorphism|isomorphic as groups]].

==Properties and Examples==
There is a natural [[group action]] of the homeomorphism group of a space on that space. Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space and denote the homeomorphism group of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. The action is defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    G\times X &amp;\longrightarrow X\\
    (\varphi, x) &amp;\longmapsto \varphi(x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a group action since for all &lt;math&gt;\varphi,\psi\in G&lt;/math&gt;, 

&lt;math&gt;\varphi\cdot(\psi\cdot x)=\varphi(\psi(x))=(\varphi\circ\psi)(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; denotes the group action, and the [[identity element]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (which is the [[identity function]] on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) sends points to themselves. If this action is [[transitive group action|transitive]], then the space is said to be [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]].

===Topology===
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}
As with other sets of maps between topological spaces, the homeomorphism group can be given a topology, such as the [[compact-open topology]].
In the case of regular, locally compact spaces the group multiplication is then continuous.

If the space is compact and Hausdorff, the inversion is continuous as well and &lt;math&gt;Homeo(X)&lt;/math&gt; becomes a [[topological group]] as one can easily show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/173093/homeomorphisms-of-x-form-a-topological-group|title=Homeomorphisms of X form a topological group|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff, locally compact  and locally connected this holds as well.&lt;ref name="vu.nl"&gt;http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dijkstra/research/papers/2005compactopen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
However there are locally compact separable metric spaces for which the inversion map is not continuous and &lt;math&gt;Homeo(X)&lt;/math&gt; therefore not a topological group.&lt;ref name="vu.nl"/&gt;

In the category of topological spaces with homeomorphisms, object groups are exactly homeomorphism groups.

==Mapping class group==
{{Main|Mapping class group}}
In [[geometric topology]] especially, one considers the [[quotient group]] obtained by quotienting out by [[Homotopy#Isotopy|isotopy]], called the [[mapping class group]]:
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm MCG}(X) = {\rm Homeo}(X) / {\rm Homeo}_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;
The MCG can also be interpreted as the 0th [[homotopy group]], &lt;math&gt;{\rm MCG}(X) = \pi_0({\rm Homeo}(X))&lt;/math&gt;.
This yields the [[short exact sequence]]:
:&lt;math&gt;1 \rightarrow {\rm Homeo}_0(X) \rightarrow {\rm Homeo}(X) \rightarrow {\rm MCG}(X) \rightarrow 1.&lt;/math&gt;

In some applications, particularly surfaces, the homeomorphism group is studied via this short exact sequence, and by first studying the mapping class group and group of isotopically trivial homeomorphisms, and then (at times) the extension.

An '''intrinsic''' [[Property (philosophy)|property]] is a property that an object or a thing has of itself, independently of other things, including its context.  An '''extrinsic''' (or '''relational''') property is a property that depends on a thing's relationship with other things. For example, [[mass]] is an intrinsic property of any [[Physical body|physical object]], whereas [[weight]] is an extrinsic property that varies depending on the strength of the gravitational field in which the respective object is placed. As such, the question of intrinsicality and extrinsicality in empirically observable objects is a significant field of study in [[ontology]], the branch of [[philosophy]] concerned with explaining the fundamental nature of [[being]].

==Criteria==
[[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] offered a list of criteria that should condense the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic properties (numbers and [[Italic type|italics]] added):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=David |authorlink=David Lewis (philosopher) |title=Extrinsic Properties |journal=Philosophical Studies |volume=44 |pages=197–200 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |year=1983 |issn=0031-8116 |doi=10.1007/bf00354100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# A sentence or statement or proposition that ascribes intrinsic properties to something is entirely ''about that thing''; whereas an ascription of extrinsic properties to something is not entirely about that thing, though it may well be about some larger whole which includes that thing as part. 
# A thing has its intrinsic properties in virtue of ''the way that thing itself, and nothing else, is''. Not so for extrinsic properties, though a thing may well have these in virtue of the way some larger whole is. 
# The intrinsic properties of something ''depend only on that thing''; whereas the extrinsic properties of something may depend, wholly or partly, on something else. 
# If something has an intrinsic property, then so does ''any perfect duplicate'' of that thing; whereas duplicates situated in different surroundings will differ in their extrinsic properties.

==Value==
Intrinsic properties are fundamental in understanding [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian [[deontological]] ethics, which is based upon the argument that an action should be viewed on its [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] (the value of the action in itself) with regard to [[ethics]] and [[morality]], as opposed to [[consequentialist]] [[utilitarian]] arguments that an action should be viewed by the value of its outcomes.

==Intrinsicism and extrinsicism==

===Intrinsicism===
Intrinsicism is the belief that value is a non-relational characteristic of an object. This means that an object can be valuable or not, good or bad, without reference to who it is good or bad for, and without reference to the reason it is good or bad. One example of this might be the belief that certain sex acts are intrinsically evil, even if they harm no one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.importanceofphilosophy.com/Evil_Intrinsicism.html Importance of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extrinsicism===
Extrinsicism is the tendency to place major emphasis on external matters rather than on more profound realities. In terms of morals and ethics, it tends to stress the external observance of laws and precepts, with lesser concern for the ultimate principles underlying moral conduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/199189/extrinsicism Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13638">'''Joel Feinberg''' (October 19, 1926 in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] – March 29, 2004 in [[Tucson, Arizona]]) was an [[Americans|American]] political and legal [[philosopher]]. He is known for his work in the fields of [[ethics]], [[Action theory (philosophy)|action theory]], [[philosophy of law]], and [[political philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;Honderich T. ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy.'' Oxford, UK: Oxford Univ. Press, 1995: 270. {{ISBN|0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as individual rights and the authority of the state.&lt;ref&gt;NEW YORK TIMES Monday April 5, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Feinberg was one of the most influential figures in American jurisprudence of the last fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Harrison, 'In Memoriam: Joel Feinberg'', University of Arizona News, March 31, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Feinberg studied at the [[University of Michigan]], writing his dissertation on the philosophy of the Harvard professor [[Ralph Barton Perry]] under the supervision of [[Charles Stevenson]]. He taught at [[Brown University]], [[Princeton University]], [[UCLA]] and [[Rockefeller University]], and, from 1977, at the [[University of Arizona]], where he retired in 1994 as Regents Professor of Philosophy and Law.

Feinberg was internationally distinguished for his research in [[ethics|moral]], [[social philosophy|social]] and [[legal philosophy]]. His major four-volume work, ''The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law'', was published between 1984 and 1988. Feinberg held many major fellowships during his career and lectured by invitation at universities around the world. He was an esteemed and highly successful teacher, and many of his students are now prominent scholars and professors at universities across the US.  His former students include [[Jules Coleman]], [[Russ Shafer-Landau]], and [[Clark Wolf]].

==''The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law''==

Feinberg's most important contribution to legal philosophy is his four-volume book, ''The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law'' (1984-1988), a work that is frequently characterized as "magisterial."&lt;ref&gt;For example by Dale Jamieson, ''Reason in a Dark Time: Why the Struggle against Climate'' ''Change Failed--and What It Means for Our Future'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 168; R. A. Duff, "Symposium on Criminalization," ''Criminal Law and Philosophy'' (2014), vol. 8, p. 147; Alan Werthheimer, "Liberty, Coercion, and the Limits of the State," in Robert L. Simon, ed., ''The Blackwell Guide to Social and Political Philosophy'' (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers, 2002), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Feinberg's goal in the book is to answer the question: What sorts of conduct may the state rightly make criminal? [[John Stuart Mill]], in his classic [[On Liberty]] (1859), had given a staunchly "liberal" answer to this question. According to Mill, the only kind of conduct that the state may rightly criminalize is conduct that causes harm to others. Though Feinberg, who had read and re-read Mill's classic text many times,&lt;ref&gt;*[https://philosophy.princeton.edu/content/john-stuart-mills-liberty-underlining-highlighting-and-marginalia-joel-feinberg-now Joel Feinberg’s heavily annotated copy of Mill’s On Liberty can be seen online at the Princeton University Digital Library.]&lt;/ref&gt; shares Mill's liberal leanings, he thinks that liberals can and should admit that certain kinds of non-harmful but profoundly offensive conduct can also properly be prohibited by law. In ''The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law'', Feinberg seeks to develop and defend a broadly Millian view of the limits of state power over the individual. In the process, he defends what many would view as characteristically "liberal" positions on topics such as suicide, obscenity, pornography, hate speech, and euthanasia. He also analyzes with great subtlety and skill concepts such as "harm," "offense," "wrong," "autonomy," "responsibility," "paternalism," "coercion," and "exploitation." In a surprising twist, Feinberg concedes in the conclusion to the final volume that liberalism may not be fully defensible.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Feinberg, ''The'' ''Moral Limits of the Criminal Law: Harmless Wrongdoing''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1988, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals, he claims, may have to concede that in rare cases it may be legitimate for the government to criminalize certain kinds of moral harms and harmless immoralities.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A ride on the bus==

In ''Offense to Others'', the second volume of ''The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law'', Feinberg offers one of the most famous thought-experiments in recent philosophy: a series of imaginary scenarios he calls "a ride on the bus." Feinberg invites us to imagine a bus ride in which you, a passenger rushing to an important appointment, are confronted by a series of deeply offensive but harmless acts. Some of the acts involve affronts to the senses (e.g., a man scratching his fingernails across a slate). Others involve acts that are deeply disgusting or revolting (e.g., eating various kinds of nauseatingly repulsive things). Still others involve affronts to our religious, moral, or patriotic sensibilities (e.g., overt acts of flag desecration); shocks to our sense of shame or embarrassment (such as acts of public sex); and a wide range of offensive conduct based on fear, anger, humiliation, boredom or frustration. The thought experiment is designed to test the limits of our tolerance for harmless but deeply offensive forms of behavior. More precisely, it raises the question "whether there are any human experiences that are harmless in themselves yet so unpleasant that we can rightly demand legal protection from them even at the cost of other persons' liberties."&lt;ref&gt;Joel Feinberg, ''The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law: Offense to Others''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1985, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Feinberg argues that even left-leaning, highly tolerant liberals must recognize that some forms of harmless but profoundly offensive conduct can properly be criminalized.

=="Psychological Egoism"==
In a paper prepared in 1958 for the benefit of students at Brown, Feinberg seeks to refute the philosophical theory of [[psychological egoism]], which in his opinion is fallacious.  So far as he can tell, there are four primary arguments for it:

#"Every action of mine is prompted by motives or desires or impulses which are ''my'' motives and not somebody else's."&lt;ref&gt;Duncan-Jones 1952, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
#"[W]hen a person gets what he wants, he characteristically feels pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg 2008, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt;
#"Often we deceive ourselves into thinking that we desire something fine or noble when what we really want is to be thought well of by others or to be able to congratulate ourselves, or to be able to enjoy the pleasures of a good conscience [...].  Indeed, it is a simple matter to explain away all allegedly unselfish motives [....]"&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg 2008, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt;  He quotes [[Lucius F. C. Garvin]] to this effect: "Once the conviction that selfishness is universal finds root in a person's mind, it is very likely to burgeon out in a thousand corroborating generalizations.  It will be discovered that a friendly smile is really only an attempt to win an approving nod from a more or less gullible recording angel; that a charitable deed is, for its performer, only an opportunity to congratulate himself on the good fortune or the cleverness that enables him to be charitable; that a public benefaction is just plain good business advertising.  It will emerge that gods are worshipped only because they indulge men's selfish fears, or tastes, or hopes; that the "golden rule" is no more than an eminently sound success formula; that social and political codes are created and subscribed to only because they serve to restrain other men's egoism as much as one's own, morality being only a special sort of "racket" or intrigue using weapons of persuasion in place of bombs and machine guns.  Under this interpretation of human nature, the categories of commercialism replace those of disinterested service and the spirit of the horse trader broods over the face of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;Garvin 1953, p. 512f.&lt;/ref&gt;
#"Psychological egoists often notice that moral education and the inculcation of manners usually utilise what [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] calls the 'sanctions of pleasure and pain.'  Children are made to acquire the civilising virtues only by the method of enticing rewards and painful punishments.  Much the same is true of the history of the race.  People in general have been inclined to behave well only when it is made plain to them that there is 'something in it for them.'  Is it not then highly probable that just such a mechanism of human motivation as Bentham describes must be presupposed by our methods of moral education?"&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg 2008, p. 522.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feinberg observes that such arguments for psychological egoism are rarely mounted on the basis of empirical proof when, being psychological, they very well ought to.  The opening argument he dubs a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]&lt;ref&gt;To his mind, it says nothing more than that all of one's motives and desires are motives and desires, which, while true, is not especially significant.&lt;/ref&gt; from which "nothing whatever concerning the nature of my motives or the objective of my desires can possibly follow [...].  It is not the genesis of an action or the ''origin'' of its motives which makes it a 'selfish' one, but rather the 'purpose' of the act or the ''objective'' of its motives; ''not where the motive comes from'' (in voluntary actions it always comes from the agent) but ''what it aims at'' determines whether or not it is selfish."&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg 2008, p. 522.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly flawed in Feinberg's opinion is the second argument.  Just because all successful endeavour engenders pleasure does not necessarily entail that pleasure is the sole objective of all endeavour.  He uses [[William James]]'s analogy to illustrate this fallacy: although an ocean liner always consumes coal on its trans-Atlantic voyages, it is unlikely that the sole purpose of these voyages is coal consumption.

The third argument, unlike the first two, contains no ''[[non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]]'' that Feinberg can see.  He nevertheless adjudges that such a sweeping generalisation is unlikely to be true.

In the final argument, Feinberg sees a paradox.  The only way to achieve happiness, he believes, is to forget about it, but psychological egoists hold that all human endeavour, even that which achieves happiness, is geared towards happiness.  Feinberg poses a [[thought experiment]] in which a character named Jones is apathetic about all but the pursuit of his own happiness.  Because he has no means to achieve that end, however, "[i]t takes little imagination [...] to see that Jones's one desire is bound to be frustrated."&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg 2008, p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt;  To pursue only happiness, then, is to fail utterly to achieve it.

'''Kundalini''' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|कुण्डलिनी}} ''{{IAST|kuṇḍalinī}}'', {{audio|Kundalini.ogg|pronunciation}}, "coiled one"), in [[Hinduism]] refers to a form of primal [[Energy (esotericism)|energy]] (or ''[[shakti]]'') said to be located at the base of the spine.
In Hindu tradition, [[Bhairavi]] is the goddess of Kundalini.&lt;ref&gt;David Frawley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=T6Vp_rTWkAAC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=Kundalini+%2B+Bhairavi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j3HjlyPsxS&amp;sig=l2lZzhk8J1DOxdwlr7lzlStllXw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiE0-eKy5HdAhVzCDQIHQzhBvwQ6AEwCnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Kundalini%20%2B%20Bhairavi&amp;f=false Inner Tantric Yoga], Lotus Press, 2008,  page 163-164&lt;/ref&gt; Kundalini awakenings may happen through a variety of methods.  Many systems of yoga focus on awakening Kundalini through: [[meditation]]; [[pranayama]] breathing; the practice of [[asana]] and chanting of [[mantra]]s.&lt;ref name="YJ Spotlight"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spotlight on Kundalini Yoga|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/basics/1336|publisher=Yoga Journal|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kundalini Yoga]] is a school of yoga that is influenced by [[Shaktism]] and [[Tantra]] schools of [[Hinduism]]. It derives its name through a focus on awakening kundalini energy through regular practice of [[Mantra]], [[Tantra]], [[Yantra]], [[Yoga]]
or [[Meditation]].&lt;ref name="YJ Spotlight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swami Sivananda Radha 2004, pp 13-15"&gt;Swami Sivananda Radha,  2004, pp. 13, 15&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kundalini experience is frequently reported to be a distinct feeling of electric current running along the spine.&lt;ref name="Sarawati"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saraswati|first1=Swami Satyananda|title=Kundalini Tantra|date=1984|publisher=Bihar School of Yoga|location=Munger, Bihar, India|isbn=978-8185787152|pages=34–36|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Judith|first1=Anodea|title=Eastern Body, Western Mind: Psychology and the Chakra System as a Path to the Self|date=2004|publisher=Celestial Arts|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-1-58761-225-1|pages=451–454|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paulson|first1=Genevieve Lewis|title=Kundalini and the Chakras: A Practical Manual--evolution in this Lifetime|date=1998|publisher=Llewellyn Publications|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|isbn=978-0-87542-592-4|pages=7–10, 194|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The concept of Kundalini is mentioned in the [[Upanishads]] (9h century BCE – 3rd century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dale|first1=Cyndi|title=Kundalini: Divine Energy, Divine Life |date=2011|publisher=Llewellyn Publications|location=Woodbury, Minnesota|isbn=978-0-7387-2863-6|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{check|date=July 2015}} The Sanskrit adjective ''{{IAST|kuṇḍalin}}'' means "circular, annular". It is mentioned as a noun for "snake" (in the sense "coiled", as in "forming ringlets") in the 12th-century ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' chronicle (I.2). ''{{IAST|Kuṇḍa}}'' (a noun meaning "bowl, water-pot" is found as the name of a [[Nāga|Naga]] in [[Mahabharata]] 1.4828). The 8th-century ''Tantrasadbhava Tantra'' uses the term ''kundalī'' ("ring, bracelet; coil (of a rope)").&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=David Gordon|title=Kiss of the Yogini: "Tantric Sex" in its South Asian Contexts|date=2004|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-89483-6|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|230}}{{clarify|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--cite the verse. the word does not appear in online translations of this text--&gt;

The use of ''kuṇḍalī'' as a name for Goddess [[Durga]] (a form of [[Shakti]]) appears often in [[Tantrism]] and [[Shaktism]] from as early as the 11th century in the ''Śaradatilaka''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saivism|first1=Kashmir Saivism|title=Vac: The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras|date=1990|publisher=Sri Satguru Publications|isbn=978-1-4384-1532-1|pages=124–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted as a technical term in [[Hatha yoga]] during the 15th century, and became widely used in the [[Yoga Upanishad]]s by the 16th century. [[Eknath Easwaran]] has paraphrased the term as "the coiled power", a force which ordinarily rests at the base of the spine, described as being "coiled there like a serpent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrison|first1=Diana|title=A Glossary of Sanskrit from the Spiritual Tradition of India|date=1977|publisher=Nilgiri Press|location=Petaluma, California|isbn=978-0-915132-11-9|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When awakened, Kundalini is said to rise up from the [[muladhara]] [[chakra]], through the central [[nadis|nadi]] (called ''[[sushumna]]'') inside or alongside the spine reaching the top of the head. The progress of Kundalini through the different [[chakra]]s is believed to achieve different levels of awakening and a [[mystical experience]], until Kundalini finally reaches the top of the head, [[Sahasrara]] or crown [[chakra]], producing an extremely profound transformation of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Sarawati" /&gt;{{rp|5–6}} Energy is said to accumulate in the [[muladhara]], and the [[yogi]] seeks to send it up to the brain transforming it into 'Ojas', the highest form of energy.

There are many physical effects that some people believe to be a sign of a Kundalini awakening; however, there are also others who contend that the undesirable side effects are not Kundalini but chakra awakening.&lt;ref name="Maheshwaranada"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maheshwarananda|first1=Paramhans Swami|authorlink=Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda|title=The Hidden Power in Humans: Chakras and Kundalini|date=2004|publisher=Ibera Verlag|location=|isbn=978-3-85052-197-0|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are either common signs of an awakened Kundalini or symptoms of a problem associated with an awakening Kundalini:

* Enlightenment
* Bliss, feelings of infinite love and universal connectivity, transcendent awareness, seeing truth (third eye opening), euphoria
* Awakened sense of smell, hearing, taste
* No longer controlled by desire/cravings
* Sound heard in the pineal gland (pleasurable/enjoyable)
* Change in the thyroid, sudden ability to sing in perfect pitch, change in voice
* Change in the sex organs
* Change in breathing
* Energy rushes or feelings of electricity circulating the body. This tingly feeling, at first, might be mistaken for a "shiver."
* Involuntary jerks, tremors, shaking, itching, tingling, and crawling sensations, especially in the arms and legs
* Intense heat (sweating) or cold, especially as energy is experienced passing through the [[chakra]]s
* Spontaneous [[pranayama]], [[asana]]s, [[mudra]]s and [[Bandha (Yoga)|bandhas]]
* Visions or sounds at times associated with a particular chakra
* Diminished or control over sexual desire
* Emotional upheavals or surfacing of unwanted and repressed feelings or thoughts with certain repressed emotions becoming dominant in the conscious mind for short or long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Eastman" /&gt;
* Headache, migraine, or pressure inside the skull. Relief of this pressure during an awakening may be felt as a "popping," depending on the person and their body at the time the awakening begins to occur.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* Pains in different areas of the body, especially back and neck
* Sensitivity to light, sound, and touch
* Trance-like and altered states of consciousness
* Disrupted sleep pattern (periods of insomnia or oversleeping)
* Vegetarianism or veganism
* Change in body odor (sweetness/natural/healthy)

In his article on Kundalini in the ''Yoga Journal'', David Eastman narrates two personal experiences. One man said that he felt an activity at the base of his spine starting to flow, so he relaxed and allowed it to happen. A feeling of surging energy began traveling up his back. At each chakra, he felt an orgasmic electric feeling like every nerve trunk on his spine beginning to fire. A second man describes a similar experience but accompanied by a wave of euphoria and happiness softly permeating his being. He described the surging energy as being like electricity but hot, traveling from the base of his spine to the top of his head. He said the more he analyzed the experience, the less it occurred.&lt;ref name="Eastman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eastman |first=David T. |title=Kundalini Demystified |journal=Yoga Journal |date=September 1985 |pages=37–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Building a Noble Worl''d, [[Shiv R. Jhawar]] describes his '''Kundalini awakening''' experience at Muktananda's public program at Lake Point Tower in Chicago on September 16, 1974, as follows:

"Baba [Swami Muktananda] had just begun delivering his discourse with his opening statement: 'Today's subject is meditation. The crux of the question is: What do we meditate upon?' Continuing his talk, Baba said: 'Kundalini starts dancing when one repeats Om Namah Shivaya.' Hearing this, I mentally repeated the mantra. I noticed that my breathing was getting heavier. Suddenly, I felt a great impact of a rising force within me. The intensity of this rising kundalini force was so tremendous that my body lifted up a little and fell flat into the aisle; my eyeglasses flew off. As I lay there with my eyes closed, I could see a continuous fountain of dazzling white lights erupting within me. In brilliance, these lights were brighter than the sun but possessed no heat at all. I was experiencing the thought-free state of "I am," realizing that "I" have always been, and will continue to be, eternal. I was fully conscious and completely aware while I was experiencing the pure "I am," a state of supreme bliss. Outwardly, at that precise moment, Baba delightfully shouted from his platform...''mene kuch nahi kiya; kisiko shakti ne pakda'' (I didn't do anything. The Energy has caught someone.)' Baba noticed that the dramatic awakening of kundalini in me frightened some people in the audience. Therefore, he said, 'Do not be frightened. Sometimes kundalini gets awakened in this way, depending upon a person's type.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jhawar|first1=Shiv R.|title=Building a Noble World|date=2004|publisher=Noble World Foundation|isbn=978-0-9749197-0-6|page=85|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kundalini experiences ==

=== Invoking Kundalini experiences ===
Several yogis consider that Kundalini can be awakened by ''[[shaktipat]]'' (spiritual transmission by a Guru or teacher), or by spiritual practices such as yoga or meditation.

There are two broad approaches to Kundalini awakening: active and passive. The ''active approach'' involves systematic physical exercises and techniques of concentration, visualization, [[pranayama]] (breath practice) and meditation under the guidance of a competent teacher. These techniques come from any of the four main branches of yoga, and some forms of yoga, such as [[Kriya yoga]], [[Kundalini yoga]] and [[Sahaja yoga]].

The ''passive approach'' is instead a path of surrender where one lets go of all the impediments to the awakening rather than trying to actively awaken Kundalini. A chief part of the passive approach is [[shaktipat]] where one individual's Kundalini is awakened by another who already has the experience. Shaktipat only raises Kundalini temporarily but gives the student an experience to use as a basis.&lt;ref name="Eastman" /&gt;

[[Gopi Krishna (yogi)|Gopi Krishna]] reports having experienced his first kundalini awakening at age 34. In his book ''Kundalini: Questions and Answers'' he writes that while meditating upon a lotus in full bloom his attention was drawn towards the crown of his head. He began to experience a sensation of light as if it was entering his brain which was at first distracting but soon began to acquire an enrapturing condition. He felt it "like liquid light through all my nervous system, in my stomach, in my heart, in my lungs, in my throat, in my head, and taking control of the whole body. That was a most marvelous experience for me, as if a new life energy had now taken possession of my body."{{fact|date=May 2018}}

He subsequently came to believe "As the ancient writers have said, it is the vital force or [[prana]] which is spread over both the macrocosm, the entire Universe, and the microcosm, the human body... The atom is contained in both of these. Prana is life-energy responsible for the phenomena of terrestrial life and for life on other planets in the universe. Prana in its universal aspect is immaterial. But in the human body, Prana creates a fine biochemical substance which works in the whole organism and is the main agent of activity in the nervous system and in the brain. The brain is alive only because of Prana...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krishna|first1=Gopti|title=Kundalini Questions and Answers|date=1995|publisher=The Institute for Consciousness Studies|isbn=978-0-9938316-6-9|pages=6–8|edition=Smashwords}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quotation|...The most important psychological changes in the character of an enlightened person would be that he or she would be compassionate and more detached. There would be less ego, without any tendency toward violence or aggression or falsehood. The awakened life energy is the mother of morality, because all morality springs from this awakened energy. Since the very beginning, it has been this evolutionary energy that has created the concept of morals in human beings.}}

American [[comparative religions]] scholar [[Joseph Campbell]] describes the concept of Kundalini as "the figure of a coiled female serpent—a serpent goddess not of "gross" but "subtle" substance—which is to be thought of as residing in a torpid, slumbering state in a subtle center, the first of the seven, near the base of the spine: the aim of the yoga then being to rouse this serpent, lift her head, and bring her up a subtle nerve or channel of the spine to the so-called "thousand-petaled lotus" ([[Sahasrara]]) at the crown of the head...She, rising from the lowest to the highest lotus center will pass through and wake the five between, and with each waking, the psychology and personality of the practitioner will be altogether and fundamentally transformed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Joseph|title=A Joseph Campbell Companion: Reflections on the Art of Living|date=2011|publisher=Joseph Campbell Foundation|location=San Anselmo, California|isbn=978-1-61178-006-2|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hatha yoga ====
According to the [[hatha yoga]] text, the ''Goraksasataka'', or "Hundred Verses of Goraksa", certain hatha yoga practices including [[mula bandha]], uddiyana bandha, [[Jalandhara Bandha|jalandhara bandha]] and [[kumbhaka]] can awaken Kundalini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=David Gordon|title=Yoga in Practice|date=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-691-14085-8|pages=2, 268–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hathayoga text, the ''Khecarīvidyā'', states that [[kechari mudra]] enables one to raise Kundalini and access various stores of [[amrita]] in the head, which subsequently flood the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallinson|first1=James|title=The Khecarividya of Adinatha: A Critical Edition and Annotated Translation of an Early Text of Hathayoga|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-39115-3|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shaktipat ====
The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] emphasized the need for a master when actively trying to awaken Kundalini:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Kundalini is a latent power in the higher body. When awakened, it pierces through six chakras or functional centers and activates them. Without a master, the awakening of the kundalini cannot take anyone very far on the Path; and such indiscriminate or premature awakening is fraught with dangers of self-deception as well as the misuse of powers. The kundalini enables man to consciously cross the lower planes and it ultimately merges into the universal cosmic power of which it is a part, and which also is at times described as kundalini&amp;nbsp;... The important point is that the awakened kundalini is helpful only up to a certain degree, after which it cannot ensure further progress. It cannot dispense with the need for the grace of a Perfect Master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baba|first1=Meher|authorlink=Meher Baba|title=Beams from Meher Baba on the Spiritual Panorama|date=1958|publisher=Sufism Reoriented|location=San Francisco|pages=13–14|url=http://ambppct.org/Book_Files/Beams.pdf|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Kundalini awakening while prepared or unprepared ===
The experience of Kundalini awakening can happen when one is either prepared or unprepared.&lt;ref name="Eastman" /&gt;

==== Preparedness ====
According to Hindu tradition, in order to be able to integrate this spiritual energy, a period of careful purification and strengthening of the body and nervous system is usually required beforehand.&lt;ref name="Maheshwaranada" /&gt; Yoga and [[Tantra]] propose that Kundalini can be awakened by a [[guru]] (teacher), but body and spirit must be prepared by yogic austerities, such as [[pranayama]], or breath control, physical exercises, visualization, and chanting. The student is advised to follow the path in an open-hearted manner.&lt;ref name="Eastman" /&gt;

Traditionally, people would visit ashrams in India to awaken their dormant kundalini energy. Typical activities would include regular meditation, mantra chanting, spiritual studies as well as a physical asana practice such as [[kundalini yoga]].

==== Spontaneously ====
The Kundalini always awakens spontaneously when the person least expects it. Whether prepared or unprepared, the kundalini rises despite any attempt to stop it by the sadhak.

== Religious interpretations ==

=== Indian interpretations ===
Kundalini is considered to occur in the [[chakra]] and [[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]] of the [[subtle body]]. Each chakra is said to contain special characteristics&lt;ref name="Scotton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scotton|first1=Bruce W.|title=Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology|date=1999|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-09530-8|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with proper training, moving Kundalini through these chakras can help express or open these characteristics.

Kundalini is described as a sleeping, dormant potential force in the human organism.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Satyananda Saraswati. Kundalini Tantra.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}} It is one of the components of an esoteric description of the "[[subtle body]]", which consists of [[nadis]] (energy channels), [[chakras]] (psychic centres), [[prana]] (subtle energy), and [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]] (drops of essence).

Kundalini is described as being coiled up at the base of the spine. The description of the location can vary slightly, from the rectum to the navel.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;{{rp|229–231}} Kundalini is said to reside in the triangular shaped [[sacrum]] bone in three and a half coils.&lt;ref name="Srivastava" /&gt;

[[Ramana Maharshi]] mentioned that Kundalini is nothing but the natural energy of the Self, where Self is the universal consciousness ([[Paramatma]]) present in every being and that the individual mind of thoughts cloaks this natural energy from unadulterated expression. [[Advaita]] teaches [[self-realization]], [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], [[Higher consciousness|God-consciousness]], and [[nirvana]]. But initial Kundalini awakening is just the beginning of the actual spiritual experience. Self-inquiry meditation is considered a very natural and simple means of reaching this goal.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Swami Vivekananda]] describes Kundalini briefly in his book ''Raja Yoga'' as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vivekananda|first1=Swami|title=Raja Yoga: Conquering the Internal Nature|date=1995|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|location=Calcutta|isbn=978-8185301167|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the [[Yogi]]s, there are two nerve currents in the spinal column, called Pingalâ and Idâ, and a hollow canal called [[Susumna|Sushumnâ]] running through the spinal cord. At the lower end of the hollow canal is what the Yogis call the "Lotus of the Kundalini". They describe it as triangular in a form in which, in the symbolical language of the Yogis, there is a power called the Kundalini, coiled up. When that Kundalini awakens, it tries to force a passage through this hollow canal, and as it rises step by step, as it were, layer after layer of the mind becomes open and all the different visions and wonderful powers come to the Yogi. When it reaches the brain, the Yogi is perfectly detached from the body and mind; the soul finds itself free. We know that the spinal cord is composed in a peculiar manner. If we take the figure eight horizontally (∞), there are two parts which are connected in the middle. Suppose you add eight after eight, piled one on top of the other, that will represent the spinal cord. The left is the Ida, the right Pingala, and that hollow canal which runs through the center of the spinal cord is the Sushumna. Where the spinal cord ends in some of the [[lumbar vertebrae]], a fine fiber issues downwards, and the canal runs up even within that fiber, only much finer. The canal is closed at the lower end, which is situated near what is called the sacral plexus, which, according to modern physiology, is triangular in form. The different plexuses that have their centers in the spinal canal can very well stand for the different "lotuses" of the Yogi.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Kundalini [[Shakti]] is conceived as a goddess, then, when it rises to the head, it unites itself with the Supreme Being of ([[Lord Shiva]]). The aspirant then becomes engrossed in deep meditation and infinite bliss. [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] in his book ''[[Bhagavad Gita (Yogananda)|God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita]]'' states:&lt;ref name="Yogananda"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yogananda|first1=Paramahansa|title=The Bhagavad Gita: God Talks with Arjuna: Royal Science of God Realization: the Immortal Dialogue Between Soul and Spirit: a New Translation and Commentary|date=1995|publisher=Self Realization Fellowship|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-87612-030-9|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2017}}

{{quote|At the command of the yogi in deep meditation, this creative force turns inward and flows back to its source in the thousand-petaled lotus, revealing the resplendent inner world of the divine forces and consciousness of the soul and spirit. Yoga refers to this power flowing from the coccyx to spirit as the awakened kundalini.}}

Paramahansa Yogananda also states:
{{quote|The yogi reverses the searchlights of intelligence, mind and life force inward through a secret astral passage, the coiled way of the kundalini in the coccygeal plexus, and upward through the sacral, the lumbar, and the higher dorsal, cervical, and medullary plexuses, and the spiritual eye at the point between the eyebrows, to reveal finally the soul's presence in the highest center (Sahasrara) in the brain.&lt;ref name="Yogananda" /&gt;{{rp|18, 1093}}}}

== Western significance ==
[[Sir John Woodroffe]] (1865–1936) – also known by his pseudonym Arthur Avalon – was a British Orientalist whose published works stimulated a far-reaching interest in [[Hindu philosophy]] and [[Yogic]] practices. While serving as a High Court Judge in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], he studied [[Sanskrit]] and [[Hindu Philosophy]], particularly as it related to Hindu [[Tantra]]. He translated numerous original [[Sanskrit]] texts and lectured on [[Indian Philosophy]], Yoga and Tantra. His book, ''The Serpent Power: The Secrets of Tantric and Shaktic Yoga'' became a major source for many modern Western adaptations of [[Kundalini yoga]] practice. It presents an academically and philosophically sophisticated translation of, and commentary on, two key Eastern texts: ''Shatchakranirūpana'' (Description and Investigation into the Six Bodily Centers) written by Tantrik Pūrnānanda Svāmī (1526) and the ''Paduka-Pancakā'' from the Sanskrit of a commentary by Kālīcharana (Five-fold Footstool of the Guru). The Sanskrit term "Kundali Shakti" translates as "Serpent Power". Kundalini is thought to be an energy released within an individual using specific meditation techniques. It is represented symbolically as a serpent coiled at the base of the spine.

In his preface to ''The Serpent Power'' Woodroffe clarifies the concept of Kundalini:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodroffe|first1=Sir John|title=The Serpent Power|date=1950|publisher=Ganesh &amp; Co. (MADRAS) LTD. The Theosophical Society|location=AdyarMadras|page=Preface|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Vivified by the “Serpent Fire”( Kundalini) they (chakras) become gates of connection between the physical and “astral” bodies. When the astral awakening of these centers first took place, this was not known to the physical consciousness. But the sense body can now “be brought to share all these advantages by repeating that process of awakening with the etheric centers. This is done by the arousing through will-force of the “Serpent Fire,” which exists clothed in “etheric matter in the physical plane, and sleeps  in the corresponding etheric center—that at the base of the spine. When this is done, it vivifies the higher centers, with the effect that it brings into the physical consciousness the powers which are aroused by the development  of their corresponding astral centers. . . There mere rousing of the Serpent Power does not, from the spiritual Yoga standpoint, amount too much. Nothing, however, of real moment, from the higher Yogi’s point of view, is achieved until the Ajna Cakra is reached. Here, again, it is said that the Sadhaka whose Atma is nothing but a meditation on the lotus “becomes the creator, preserver and destroyer of the three worlds”…It is not until the Tattvas of this center are also absorbed, and complete knowledge of the Sahasrara is gained, that the Yogi attains that which is both his aim and the motive of his labor, cessation from rebirth which follows on the control and concentration of the Citta on the Siva-sthanam, the Abode of Bliss.}}

In his book Artistic Form and Yoga in the Sacred Images of India, [[Heinrich Zimmer]] spoke highly of Woodroffe's works:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zimmer|first1=Heinrich|title=Artistic Form and Yoga in the Sacred Images of India|date=1984|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-691-02060-0|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The values of the Hindu tradition were disclosed to me through the enormous life-work of Sir John Woodroffe, alias Arthur Avalon, a pioneer and a classic author in Indie studies, second to none, who, for the first time, by many publications and books made available the extensive and complex treasure of late [[Hindu]] tradition: the [[Tantras]], a period as grand and rich as the [[Vedas]], the Epic, [[Puranas]], etc.; the latest crystallization of Indian wisdom, the indispensable closing link of a chain, affording keys to countless problems in the history of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], in mythology and symbolism.}}

When Woodroffe later commented upon the reception of his work he clarified his objective, "All the world (I speak of course of those interested in such subjects) is beginning to speak of Kundalinî Shakti." He described his intention as follows: "We, who are foreigners, must place ourselves in the skin of the [[Hindu]], and must look at their doctrine and ritual through their eyes and not our own."&lt;ref name="Jung"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jung|first1=Carl Gustav|authorlink=Carl Jung|title=The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga: Notes of the Seminar Given in 1932 by C.G.

Western awareness of kundalini was strengthened by the interest of Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Dr. [[Carl Jung]] (1875–1961). Jung's seminar on Kundalini yoga presented to the Psychological Club in Zurich in 1932 was widely regarded as a milestone in the psychological understanding of [[Eastern thought]] and of the symbolic transformations of inner experience. [[Kundalini yoga]] presented Jung with a model for the developmental phases of [[higher consciousness]], and he interpreted its symbols in terms of the process of individuation, with sensitivity towards a new generation's interest in alternative religions and psychological exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nichol|first1=David|title=Psychoanalytic Books:|journal=A Quarterly Journal of Reviews|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction to Jung's book ''The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga'', [[Sonu Shamdasani]] puts forth "The emergence of depth psychology was historically paralleled by the translation and widespread dissemination of the texts of yoga... for the depth psychologies sought to liberate themselves from the stultifying limitations of Western thought to develop maps of inner experience grounded in the transformative potential of therapeutic practices. A similar alignment of "theory" and "practice" seemed to be embodied in the yogic texts that moreover had developed independently of the bindings of Western thought. Further, the initiatory structure adopted by institutions of psychotherapy brought its social organization into proximity with that of yoga. Hence, an opportunity for a new form of comparative psychology opened up."&lt;ref name="Jung" /&gt;{{rp|xviii-xix}}

The American writer William Buhlman, began to conduct an international survey of out-of-body experiences in 1969 in order to gather information about symptoms: sounds, vibrations and other phenomena, that commonly occur at the time of the OBE event.  His primary interest was to compare the findings with reports made by yogis, such as [[Gopi Krishna (yogi)]] who have made reference to similar phenomenon, such as the 'vibrational state' as components of their kundalini-related [[spiritual experience]]. He explains:
{{Quotation| There are numerous reports of full Kundalini experiences culminating with a transcendental out-of-body state of consciousness. In fact, many people consider this experience to be the ultimate path to enlightenment. The basic premise is to encourage the flow of Kundalini energy up the spine and toward the top of the head—the [[crown chakra]]—thus projecting your awareness into the higher heavenly dimensions of the universe. The result is an indescribable expansion of consciousness into spiritual realms beyond form and thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buhlman|first1=William|title=The Secret of the Soul: Using Out-of-Body Experiences to Understand Our True Nature|date=2011|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-06-196808-2|page=191|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

George King (1919–1997), founder of the [[Aetherius Society]], describes the concept of Kundalini throughout his works and claimed to have experienced this energy many times throughout his life while in a "positive samadhic yogic trance state".{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theninefreedoms.org/dr-george-king.html|title=Dr. George King – The Nine Freedoms 50th Anniversary|website=theninefreedoms.org|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to King,
&lt;blockquote&gt;It should always be remembered that despite appearances to the contrary, the complete control of Kundalini through the spinal column is man's only reason for being on Earth, for when this is accomplished, the lessons in this classroom and the mystical examination is passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=George|title=The Nine Freedoms: An authoritative Metaphysical treatise on the progress through Ascension to Cosmic Existence|date=1998|publisher=Aetherius Society|isbn=978-0-937249-04-8|page=79|edition=3rd|url=http://www.aetherius.org/index.cfm?app=content&amp;SectionID=67&amp;PageID=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his lecture entitled ''The Psychic Centers&amp;nbsp;– Their Significance and Development'', he describes the theory behind the raising of Kundalini and how this might be done safely in the context of a balanced life devoted to selfless service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=George|title=The Psychic Centers&amp;nbsp;– Their Significance and Development|url=http://www.aetherius.org/index.cfm?app=content&amp;SectionID=155&amp;PageID=466|website=audio lecture|publisher=aetherius.org|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sri Aurobindo]] was the other great authority scholar on Kundalini parallel to Woodroffe with a somewhat different viewpoint, according to Mary Scott (who is herself a latter-day scholar on Kundalini and its physical basis) and was a member of the Theosophical Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Mary|title=Kundalini in the Physical World|date=1983|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=978-0-7100-9417-9|pages=259–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other well-known spiritual teachers who have made use of the idea of Kundalini include [[Aleister Crowley]], whose [[Gnostic Mass]] symbolically incorporates the concept via various means including the entrance procession ('circumambulation') of the Priest and Priestess; [[Albert Rudolph]] (Rudi), [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]] (Osho), [[George Gurdjieff]], [[Paramahansa Yogananda]], [[Sivananda Radha Saraswati]], who produced an English language guide to [[Kundalini yoga]] methods, [[Muktananda]], [[Bhagawan Nityananda]], [[Yogi Bhajan]], [[Nirmala Srivastava]], [[Samael Aun Weor]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

According to [[Carl Jung]] "...&amp;nbsp;the concept of Kundalini has for us only one use, that is, to describe our own experiences with the unconscious&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hayman|first1=Ronald|title=A Life of Jung|date=2001|publisher=W.

He cautioned that all forms of yoga, when used by Westerners, can be attempts at domination of the body and unconscious through the ideal of ascending into higher chakras.&lt;ref name="Shamdasani"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shamdasani|first1=Sonu|title=The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga: Notes of the Seminar Given in 1932 by C.G.

According to Shamdasani, Jung claimed that the symbolism of Kundalini yoga suggested that the bizarre symptomatology that patients at times presented, actually resulted from the awakening of the Kundalini. He argued that knowledge of such symbolism enabled much that would otherwise be seen as the meaningless by-products of a disease process to be understood as meaningful symbolic processes, and explicated the often peculiar physical localizations of symptoms.&lt;ref name="Shamdasani" /&gt;{{rp|xxvi}}

Recently, there has been a growing interest within the medical community to study the physiological effects of [[meditation]], and some of these studies have applied the discipline of Kundalini yoga to their clinical settings.&lt;ref&gt;Lazar et al.

The popularization of eastern spiritual practices has been associated with psychological problems in the west. Psychiatric literature notes that "since the influx of eastern spiritual practices and the rising popularity of meditation starting in the 1960s, many people have experienced a variety of psychological difficulties, either while engaged in intensive spiritual practice or spontaneously".&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turner|first1=R.

The differentiation between spiritual emergency associated with Kundalini awakening may be viewed as an acute [[psychotic episode]] by psychiatrists who are not conversant with the culture. The biological changes of increased P300 amplitudes that occurs with certain yogic practices may lead to acute psychosis. Biological alterations by Yogic techniques may be used to warn people against such reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bharadwaj|first1=Balaji|title=Proof-of-concept studies in Yoga and mental health|journal=International Journal of Yoga|date=2012|volume=5|issue=1|page=74|doi=10.4103/0973-6131.91719|url=http://www.ijoy.org.in/article.asp?issn=0973-6131;year=2012;volume=5;issue=1;spage=74;epage=74;aulast=Bharadwaj|accessdate=5 January 2017|issn=0973-6131|pmc=3276938|pmid=22346071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tort]] of '''negligent infliction of emotional distress''' ('''NIED''') is a controversial [[cause of action]], which is available in nearly all [[U.S. state]]s but is severely constrained and limited in the majority of them.  The underlying concept is that one has a [[Duty of care|legal duty]] to use reasonable care to avoid causing [[emotion]]al [[stress (medicine)|distress]] to another individual.  If one fails in this duty and unreasonably causes emotional distress to another person, that actor will be [[Legal liability|liable]] for monetary [[damages]] to the injured individual.  The tort is to be contrasted with [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] in that there is no need to prove intent to inflict distress.  That is, an accidental infliction, if negligent, is sufficient to support a cause of action.

==History==

NIED began to develop in the late nineteenth century, but only in a very limited form, in the sense that plaintiffs could recover for consequential emotional distress as a component of damages when a defendant negligently inflicted physical harm upon them.  By 1908, most industrial U.S. states had adopted the "physical impact" form of NIED.  However, NIED started developing into its more mature and more controversial form in the mid-20th century, as the new machines of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] flooded the legal system with all kinds of previously unimaginable complex factual scenarios.  Courts began to allow plaintiffs to recover for emotional distress resulting from negligent physical injuries to not only themselves, but other persons with whom they had a special relationship, like a relative.  The first step, then, was to remove the requirement of physical injury to the actual plaintiff while keeping the requirement of physical injury to ''someone.''  In the 1968 landmark decision of ''[[Dillon v. Legg]]'', the [[Supreme Court of California]] was the first court to allow recovery for emotional distress alone{{spaced ndash}}even in the absence of any physical injury to the plaintiff{{spaced ndash}}in the particular situation where the plaintiff simply witnessed the death of a close relative at a distance, and was not within the "zone of danger" where the relative was killed.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Dillon v. Legg]]'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/68C2d728.htm 68 Cal. 2d 728] (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2007 statistical study commissioned by the Court found that ''Dillon'' was the most persuasive decision published by the Court between 1940 and 2005; ''Dillon'' has been favorably cited and followed by at least twenty reported out-of-state appellate decisions, more than any other California appellate decision.&lt;ref&gt;Jake Dear and Edward W. Jessen, ''" Followed Rates" and Leading State Cases, 1940-2005'', &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;[http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/41/2/essay/DavisVol41No2_Dear.pdf 41 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 683, 694]&lt;/span&gt;(2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step after ''Dillon'' was to make optional the element of another person (so that the injury could be to ''anything'' where it would be reasonably foreseeable that such injury would cause some person emotional distress). The first such case was ''Rodrigues v. State'',&lt;ref&gt;52 Haw. 156, 472 P.2d 509 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[Supreme Court of Hawaii]] held that plaintiffs could recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress as a result of negligently caused flood damage to their home.  This is generally considered to be the true birth of NIED as a separate tort.

Twelve years after ''Dillon'', [[California]] expanded NIED again, by holding that a relative could recover even where the underlying physical injury was ''[[de minimis]]'' (unnecessary medications and medical tests) if the outcome was foreseeable (the breakup of the plaintiffs' marriage as a result of the defendants' negligent and incorrect diagnosis of a [[sexually transmitted disease]]).&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Molien v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals]]'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/27C3d916.htm 27 Cal. 3d 916] (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court for the first time recognized NIED as part of federal common law, by holding that railroad workers could pursue NIED claims against their employers under the [[Federal Employers Liability Act]].&lt;ref&gt;''Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Gottshall'', {{ussc|512|532|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court recognized only the pre-''Dillon'' form of NIED, though, in that the plaintiff had to be within a zone of danger to recover in the absence of physical injury.  

In 1999, [[Hawaii]] took NIED even further by expressly holding that "damages may be based solely upon serious emotional distress, even absent proof of a predicate physical injury."&lt;ref&gt;''Roes v. FHP, Inc.'', [http://www.state.hi.us/jud/21504.htm 91 Haw. 470, 985 P.2d 661] (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

It is generally disfavored by most states because it appears to have no definable parameters and because so many potential claims can be made under it. The situations that would give rise to such a claim are difficult to define. Because of this substantial uncertainty, most legal theorists find the theory to be unworkable in practice. 

A corollary of this critique is that the tort runs the risk (in the bystander NIED context) of overcompensating plaintiffs for distress which would have occurred anyway ''regardless'' of the cause of death of the decedent. In a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of California, which severely limited the availability of bystander NIED, Associate Justice [[David Eagleson]] wrote in ''[[Thing v. La Chusa]]'', 48 Cal. 3d 644 (1989): 

{{cquote|No policy supports extension of the right to recover for NIED to a larger class of plaintiffs. Emotional distress is an intangible condition experienced by most persons, even absent negligence, at some time during their lives. Close relatives suffer serious, even debilitating, emotional reactions to the injury, death, serious illness, and evident suffering of loved ones. These reactions occur regardless of the cause of the loved one's illness, injury, or death. That relatives will have severe emotional distress is an unavoidable aspect of the 'human condition.' The emotional distress for which monetary damages may be recovered, however, ought not to be that form of acute emotional distress or the transient emotional reaction to the occasional gruesome or horrible incident to which every person may potentially be exposed in an industrial and sometimes violent society. . . . The overwhelming majority of 'emotional distress' which we endure, therefore, is not compensable.&lt;ref&gt;''Thing v. La Chusa'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C3/48C3d644.htm 48 Cal. 3d 644, 666-667] (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An additional criticism of the tort is that it leads to abuse of [[liability insurance]] coverage. Most liability insurance [[insurance policy|policies]] provide for coverage of negligently inflicted [[injury|injuries]] but exclude coverage of [[intentional tort|intentionally inflicted injuries]]. If a victim is intentionally injured by a person, many theorists perceive that the victim will tend to recast the claim as being one for [[negligence]] in order to fall within the coverage of the insurance policy.

The [[Texas]] case of ''[[Boyles v. Kerr]]'', 855 S.W.2d 593 (Tex. 1993) is illustrative. In this case, the [[defendant]] secretly [[videotape]]d himself engaging in [[Human sexuality|sexual]] activities with the [[plaintiff]]. The defendant then showed this videotape to numerous individuals and caused severe distress to the plaintiff. The plaintiff brought suit against the defendant, asserting a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.

On appeal, the [[Supreme Court of Texas]] observed that the facts did not support a claim of negligence. Rather, the Court noted, the facts clearly supported a claim of an intentional injury by the defendant and it was evident that the claim had been cast as "negligence" solely to obtain insurance coverage. The Court then went on to hold that Texas did not recognize a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress and [[wikt:remand|remanded]] the case to the trial court for consideration of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. 

Jurisdictions that have rejected the claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress do not forbid the recovery of damages for [[mental injury|mental injuries]].  Instead, these jurisdictions usually allow recovery for emotional distress where such distress:
# is inflicted [[intention]]ally (i.e., intentional infliction of emotional distress)
# is directly associated with a [[Trauma (medicine)|physical injury]] negligently inflicted upon a victim (e.g., emotional distress resulting from a loss of limb or disfigurement of the face)
# is caused by [[Defamation|defamation and libel]];
# stems from witnessing a [[wikt:gruesome|gruesome]] accident as a bystander
# is the product of some misconduct universally recognized as causing emotional distress such as mishandling a loved one’s [[Cadaver|corpse]] or failing to deliver a death notice in a timely manner.

== Etymology ==
The word ''nirvāṇa'', states Steven Collins, is from the verbal root ''vā'' "blow" in the form of past participle ''vāna'' "blown", prefixed with the preverb ''nis'' meaning "out". Hence the original meaning of the word is "blown out, extinguished". [[Sandhi]] changes the sounds: the ''v'' of ''vāna'' causes ''nis'' to become ''nir'', and then the ''r'' of ''nir'' causes [[retroflexion]] of the following ''n'': ''nis+vāna'' &gt; ''nirvāṇa''.{{sfn|Collins|2010|pp=63-64}}

The term ''nirvana'' in the soteriological sense of "blown out, extinguished" state of liberation does not appear in the [[Veda]]s nor in the [[Upanishad]]s. According to Collins, "the Buddhists seem to have been the first to call it ''nirvana''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57054-1|pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ideas of spiritual liberation using different terminology, with the concept of soul and Brahman, appears in Vedic texts and Upanishads, such as in verse 4.4.6 of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Max Müller |title=Theosophy Or Psychological Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjiD_XWea7cC |year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-07326-4 |pages=307–310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been deliberate use of words in early Buddhism, suggests Collins, since Atman and Brahman were described in Vedic texts and Upanishads with the imagery of fire, as something good, desirable and liberating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57054-1|pages=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of ''moksha'' is connected to the Vedic culture, where it conveyed a notion of ''amrtam'', "immortality",{{sfn|Collins|2010|p=29}}{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=136}} and also a notion of a ''timeless'', "unborn", or "the still point of the turning world of time". It was also its timeless structure, the whole underlying "the spokes of the invariable but incessant wheel of time".{{refn|group=note|The wheel is a typical Vedic, or Indo-European, symbol, which is manifested in various symbols of the [[Historical vedic religion|Vedic religion]] and of Buddhism and Hinduism.

Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and either permanent heaven or permanent hell is disproportionate.

=== Moksha ===
{{main article|Moksha}}
The ancient soteriological concept in Hinduism is moksha, described as the liberation from the cycle of birth and death through self-knowledge and the eternal connection of Atman (soul, self) and metaphysical Brahman. Moksha is derived from the root ''muc*'' ({{lang-sa|मुच्}}) which means free, let go, release, liberate; Moksha means "liberation, freedom, emancipation of the soul".&lt;ref name=mmw&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0800/mw__0853.html मुच] Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heinrich Robert Zimmer|title=Philosophies of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bRQ5fpTmwoAC&amp;pg=PA41|year=1951|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-01758-1|page=41|quote=Moksa, from the root muc, "to loose, set free, let go, release, liberate, deliver" [...] means "liberation, escape, freedom, release, rescue, deliverance, final emancipation of the soul.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Vedas and early Upanishads, the word mucyate ({{lang-sa|मुच्यते}})&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt; appears, which means to be set free or release - such as of a horse from its harness.

The traditions within Hinduism state that there are multiple paths (''marga'') to moksha: ''jnana-marga'', the path of knowledge; ''bhakti-marga'', the path of devotion; and ''karma-marga'', the path of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chad Meister|title=Introducing Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOCT3qFirJMC |year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-14179-1|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brahma-nirvana in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' ===
The term Brahma-nirvana appears in verses 2.72 and 5.24-26 of the Bhagavad Gita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Winthrop Sargeant (Translator)|editor=Christopher Key Chapple|title=The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COuy5CDAqt4C |year=2010|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-1-4384-2840-6 |pages=157, 266–268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the state of release or liberation; the union with the [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="Flood" /&gt; According to Easwaran, it is an experience of blissful egolessness.{{sfn|Easwaran|2007|p=268}}

According to Zaehner, Johnson and other scholars, ''nirvana'' in the Gita is a Buddhist term adopted by the Hindus.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=48}} Zaehner states it was used in Hindu texts for the first time in the Bhagavad Gita, and that the idea therein in verse 2.71-72 to "suppress one's desires and ego" is also Buddhist.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=48}} According to Johnson the term ''nirvana'' is borrowed from the Buddhists to confuse the Buddhists, by linking the Buddhist nirvana state to the pre-Buddhist Vedic tradition of metaphysical absolute called Brahman.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=48}}

According to [[Mahatma Gandhi]], the Hindu and Buddhist understanding of ''nirvana'' are different because the nirvana of the Buddhists is [[shunyata]], emptiness, but the nirvana of the Gita means peace and that is why it is described as brahma-nirvana (oneness with Brahman).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|quote=The nirvana of the Buddhists is shunyata, emptiness, but the nirvana of the Gita means peace and that is why it is described as brahma-nirvana [oneness with Brahman]|publisher=North Atlantic Books|year=2009|title=The Bhagavad Gita&amp;nbsp;– According to Gandhi|author=Mahatma Gandhi|editor=John Strohmeier|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''[[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]]'' and ''nirvana'' are often used interchangeably in the [[Jain texts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }}: ''"Moksa and Nirvana are synonymous in Jainism".'' p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carrithers, Caroline Humphrey (1991) ''The Assembly of listeners: Jains in society'' Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521365058}}: ''"Nirvana: A synonym for liberation, release, moksa."'' p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

Uttaradhyana Sutra provides an account of Sudharman – also called Gautama, and one of the disciples of Mahavira – explaining the meaning of nirvana to Kesi, a disciple of [[Parshva]].&lt;ref name="Jacobi 1895"&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann |author2=Ed.

{{quote|There is a safe place in view of all, but difficult of approach, where there is no old age nor death, no pain nor disease. It is what is called nirvāṇa, or freedom from pain, or perfection, which is in view of all; it is the safe, happy, and quiet place which the great sages reach. That is the eternal place, in view of all, but difficult of approach. Those sages who reach it are free from sorrows, they have put an end to the stream of existence. (81-4) – Translated by Hermann Jacobi, 1895}}

==Manichaenism==
The term ''Nirvana'' (also mentioned is ''parinirvana'') in the thirteenth or fourtheenth century [[Manichaenism|Manichaean]] work "The great song to Mani" and "The story of the Death of Mani", referring to the [[Pleroma|''realm of light'']].&lt;ref&gt;Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer ''The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition'' Shambhala Publications 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}} page 669&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism==
The concept of liberation as "extinction of suffering", along with the idea of ''sansara'' as the "cycle of rebirth" is also part of Sikhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Owen Cole |author2=Piara Singh Sambhi |title=The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIC_MgJ5RMUC |year=1995|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-13-4 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana appears in Sikh texts as the term ''Nirban''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair |title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn_jBAAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-5366-1 |pages=219–220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singha2000p148"&gt;{{cite book|author=H.

In [[quantum mechanics]], "observation" is synonymous with [[quantum measurement]] and "observer" with a measurement apparatus and "[[observable]]" with what can be measured. Thus the quantum mechanical observer does not have to
''necessarily'' present or solve any problems over and above the issue of [[measurement in quantum mechanics]]. The quantum mechanical observer is also intimately tied to the issue of [[Observer effect (physics)#Quantum mechanics|observer effect]].

A number of new-age religious or philosophical [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]], notably "[[consciousness causes collapse]]",  give the observer a special role, or place constraints on who or what can be an observer. There is no credible peer-reviewed research that backs such claims.

The two groups were in contact in [[Ethiopia]]. A [[phylogeographic]] analysis of 194 lion [[DNA sequencing|sequence]]s from 22 countries indicated that East African and Southern African lions form a [[clade]] that diverged about 186,000–128,000 years ago from the clade formed by lions in North, West and Central Africa.

=== Manes ===
In the 19th and 20th centuries, lion type specimen were described on the basis of mane size and colour.  Mane colour varies between tawny, isabelline and light reddish yellow.&lt;ref name="Guggisberg1963"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guggisberg, C. A. W. |title=Simba: The Life of the Lion |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4eTaAAAAMAAJ |year=1963 |publisher=Chilton Books |location=Philadelphia, PA |page= |asin=B000OKBJQ0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Cape lion type specimen had a black mane extending beyond the shoulders and under the belly.&lt;ref name=Smith1842/&gt; Yet, black-maned lions also occur in the [[Kalahari]] and eastern [[Okavango Delta]] alongside those with a normal tawny colour.&lt;ref name=Smithers1971&gt;{{cite book |last=Smithers |first=R. H. N. |year=1971 |title=The Mammals of Botswana |publisher=University of Pretoria |location=Pretoria |chapter=Panthera leo |pages=116−119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two male lions observed in the border region between Kenya and Tanzania had moderate tufts of hair on the knee joint, and their manes appeared brushed backwards. They were less cobby with longer legs and less curved backs than lions from other African range countries.&lt;ref name=Neumann/&gt; Male lions from the Ethiopian Highlands had dark and heavy manes with black tips that extended over the whole throat and chest to the forelegs and behind the shoulders.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt; A few lions observed in the environs of Mount Kilimanjaro had tawny to sandy coloured manes as well.&lt;ref name="Lönnberg1914"/&gt;
Until the late 20th century, mane colour and size was thought to be a distinct subspecific characteristic.&lt;ref name=Hemmer1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mazak1975/&gt;

In 2002, research in [[Serengeti National Park]] revealed that mane darkens with age; its colour and size are influenced by environmental factors like temperature and climate, but also by individual [[testosterone]] production, sexual maturity and genetic precondition. Mane length apparently signals fighting success in male–male relationships.&lt;ref name="WestPacker2002"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=West |first=P. M. |author2=Packer, C. |date=2002 |title=Sexual Selection, Temperature, and the Lion's Mane |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=297 |issue=5585 |pages=1339–1943 |doi=10.1126/science.1073257 |pmid=12193785|bibcode=2002Sci...297.1339W}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mane development is related to age: older males have more extensive manes than younger ones; manes continue to grow up to the age of four to five years, long after lions have become [[Sexual maturity|sexually mature]]. Males living in the highlands above an altitude of {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}} develop heavier manes than lions in the more humid and warmer lowlands of eastern and northern Kenya. The latter have thinner manes, or are even completely maneless.&lt;ref name="Gnoskeetal2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gnoske T. P. |author2=Celesia, G. G. |author3=Kerbis, Peterhans J.

=== White lion ===
[[White lion]]s have occasionally been encountered in and around [[Kruger National Park]] and the adjacent [[Timbavati Private Game Reserve]] in South Africa. Their whitish fur is a rare [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]] caused by a double [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]] [[allele]]. It has normal pigmentation in eyes and skin. White individuals have been occasionally encountered only in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent [[Timbavati Private Game Reserve]] in eastern South Africa.

Between 1974 and 2012, 471 coalitions comprising 796 male lions entered a study area of {{convert|2000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Of these, 35 coalitions included male lions that were born in the area but had left and returned after about two years of absence. Nomadic coalitions became resident at between 3.5 and 7.3 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Borrego, N., Ozgul, A., Slotow, R. and Packer, C. |year=2018 |title=Lion population dynamics: do nomadic males matter? |journal=Behavioral Ecology |volume=29 |issue=3 |doi=10.1093/beheco/ary018 |pages=660–666 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lions living near ranches in the vicinity of Tsavo East National Park consisted of three prides, two pairs and a single lion in 2002.&lt;ref name=Patterson_al2004&gt;{{cite journal |author=Patterson, B.

Results of a 10-year long survey on 50 [[Radio telemetry|radio-collared]] lions in the Kavango–Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area show that adult lions preferred grassland and [[shrubland]] habitat, but avoided woodlands and areas with high human density; by contrast, subadult [[biological dispersal|dispersing]] male lions avoided grasslands and shrublands, but moved in human-dominated areas to a larger extent. Hence, dispersing lions are more vulnerable to coming into [[Human–wildlife conflict|conflict]] with humans than adult lions.&lt;ref name=Elliot_al2014&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Elliot, N.

In the semi-arid savanna of Zimbabwe’s Hwange National Park, 19 lions were radio-collared and tracked between 2002 and 2007. Both female and male lions moved foremost within {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} of waterholes in all seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Valeix, M., Loveridge, A.

=== Hunting and diet ===
Lions usually [[Cooperative hunting|hunt in groups]] and prey foremost on [[ungulate]]s such as [[zebra]], [[warthog]], [[blue wildebeest]], [[impala]], [[gemsbok]], [[Thomson's gazelle]], [[kob]], [[waterbuck]], [[kudu]], [[giraffe]] and [[Cape buffalo]]. Their [[prey]] is usually in the range of {{convert|40|to|270|kg|lb|abbr=in}}.&lt;ref name=Hayward2005&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hayward |first1=M. W. |last2=Kerley |first2=G. I.

They scavenged animals that were killed by other predators, or died from natural causes. They kept a constant lookout for circling vultures, apparently being aware that vultures indicate a dead animal.&lt;ref name=Schaller72/&gt;
 
In Botswana's [[Chobe National Park]], lions also prey on [[African bush elephant]]s .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Joubert |first1=D. |year=2006 |title=Hunting behaviour of lions (''Panthera leo'') on elephants (''Loxodonta africana'') in the Chobe National Park, Botswana |journal= African Journal of Ecology |issue=44 |pages=279–281 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2028.2006.00626.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Power |first1=R.

=== Attacks on humans ===
* In the 19th century, north of [[Bechuanaland]], a lion non-fatally attacked [[David Livingstone]], who was defending a [[sheep]] in a [[village]].&lt;ref name="Jeal2013"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jeal |first=Tim |title=Livingstone: Revised and Expanded Edition |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2013 |isbn= |location= |pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two [[Tsavo Man-Eaters]] became known after an incident during the building of the [[Uganda Railway]] in the 1890s.

* The "Njombe lions" were a pride of lions in [[Njombe]], in what was then [[Tanganyika]], which for over three generations are thought to have preyed on 1,500 to 2,000 people.

* Towards the end of the same month, conservationist [[Kevin Richardson (zookeeper)|Kevin Richardson]] took three lions for a walk at Dinokeng Game Reserve, near [[Pretoria]] in South Africa. A lioness then pursued an impala for at least {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}}, before unexpectedly killing a 22-year-old woman near her car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Torchia, C. |title=Lion kills woman at refuge of South African ‘lion whisperer’ |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/lion-kills-woman-at-refuge-of-south-african-lion-whisperer/2018/02/28/f1630a0c-1c6b-11e8-98f5-ceecfa8741b6_story.html |date=2018 |access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Feingold, S. |title=Lion mauls woman to death at popular South African wildlife sanctuary |publisher=[[CNN]] |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/28/africa/woman-killed-lion-sanctuary-intl/index.html |date=2018 |access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2018, a "loud commotion" coming from lions was heard by an anti-poaching dog in Sibuya Game Reserve near [[Kenton-on-Sea]], South Africa.

== Threats ==
In Africa, lions are threatened by pre-emptive killing or in retaliation for preying on livestock. Prey base depletion, loss and conversion of habitat have led to a number of subpopulations becoming small and isolated. [[Trophy hunting]] has contributed to population declines in Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; Although lions and their prey are officially protected in Tsavo National Parks, they are regularly killed by local people, with over 100 known lion killings between 2001 and 2006.&lt;ref name="Frank_al2006"/&gt;
 
Between 2008 and 2013, bones and body parts from at least 2621 individual lions were exported from South Africa to [[Southeast Asia]], and another 3437 lion skeletons between 2014 and 2016. Lion bones are used to replace [[tiger]] bones in [[traditional Asian medicine]]s.&lt;ref name="Williams_al2017"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Williams, V. L. |author2=Loveridge, A.

In 2015 and 2017, two male lions, [[Cecil (lion)|Cecil]] and his son Xanda, were killed by trophy hunters in Zimbabwe's [[Hwange National Park]].&lt;ref name="BBC2015Cecil"&gt;{{cite web |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=3 August 2015 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-33674087 |title=Zimbabwe's 'iconic' lion Cecil killed by hunter |publisher=[[BBC News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728220149/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-33674087 |archivedate=28 July 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2017Xanda"&gt;{{cite news |title=Xanda, son of Cecil the lion, killed by hunter in Zimbabwe |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-40671590 |date=20 July 2017 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In Zambia's [[Kafue National Park]], uncontrolled bushfires and hunting of lions and prey species makes it difficult for the lion population to recover. Cub mortality in particular is high.&lt;ref name="Midlane2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Midlane, N. |year=2013 |title=The conservation status and dynamics of a protected African lion ''Panthera leo'' population in Kafue National Park, Zambia |publisher=University of Cape Town |location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Conservation ==
African lions are included in [[CITES Appendix II]]. Today, lion populations are stable only in large protected area complexes.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; [[IUCN]] regional offices and many wildlife conservation organisations cooperated to develop a Lion Conservation Strategy for Eastern and Southern Africa in 2006. The strategy envisages to maintain sufficient habitat, ensure a sufficient wild prey base, make lion-human coexistence sustainable and reduce factors that lead to further fragmentation of populations.&lt;ref name=csg2006/&gt;
Local communities in several Southern African lion range countries generate significant income through [[wildlife tourism]], which is a strong incentive for their support of conservation measures.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;
 
=== In captivity ===
[[File:MP-panthera leo krugeri 5.jpg|thumb|Captive lion in [[Philadelphia Zoo]]]]
At the beginning of the 21st century, the [[Addis Ababa Zoo]] kept 16 adult lions. It is assumed that their ancestors, five males and two females, were caught in southwestern Ethiopia as part of a zoological collection for Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie I]].&lt;ref name=Brucheetal2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tefera |first=M. |title=Phenotypic and reproductive characteristics of lions (''Panthera leo'') at Addis Ababa Zoo |journal=Biodiversity &amp; Conservation |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=1629–1639 |year=2003 |doi=10.1023/A:1023641629538}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2006, eight captive lions were registered under the name ''P. l. massaicus'', and 23 as ''P. l. nubicus'' from Tanzania by the [[International Species Information System]]. In addition, about 100 captive lions were registered in ISIS as ''P. l. krugeri'', which derived from lions captured in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Barnett2006"/&gt; Interest in the Cape lion had led to attempts to conserve possible descendants in [[Tygerberg Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Associated Press]] Archive |title=South Africa: Lion Cubs Thought to Be Cape Lions |url=http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/SOUTH-AFRICA-LION-CUBS-THOUGHT-TO-BE-CAPE-LIONS/6f868f73b9fd62e43f31a152f6d011cc |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2011Capelion"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=The [[BBC News]] |title='Extinct' lions (Cape lion) surface in Siberia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1007452.stm |date=2000 |access-date=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the work of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]] outlined the workings of a '''political consciousness'''.

==The politics of consciousness==
[[Consciousness]] typically refers to the idea of a being who is self-aware.  It is a distinction often reserved for human beings.  This remains the original and most common usage of the term.  &lt;ref&gt;But a line of political and philosophical inquiry opened up which explores consciousness in terms of one's  political state of mind.&lt;/ref&gt; For Marx, consciousness describes a person's political sense of self.  That is, consciousness describes a person's awareness of politics.  For Marx, an authentic consciousness was linked to understanding one's true position in History.  While Hegel placed God behind the workings of consciousness in people, Marx saw the [[political economy]] as the engine of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/o.htm |title=Glossary of Terms: Co |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, many social movements and intellectuals have developed this use of consciousness.

==False consciousness==
{{Main|False consciousness}}
In Marx's view, consciousness was always political, for it was always the outcome of politic-economic circumstances.  What one thinks of life, power, and self, for Marx, is always a product of ideological forces.

For Marx, ideologies appear to explain and justify the current distribution of wealth and power in a society.  In societies with unequal allocations of wealth and power, ideologies present these inequalities as acceptable, virtuous, inevitable, and so forth.  Ideologies thus tend to lead people to accept the status quo.  The subordinate people come to believe in their subordination: the peasants to accept the rule of the aristocracy, the factory workers to accept the rule of the owners, consumers the rule of corporations. This belief in one's own subordination, which comes about through ideology, is, for Marx, [[false consciousness]].

That is, conditions of inequality create ideologies which confuse people about their true aspirations, loyalties, and purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm ''The German ideology'', Part 1]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, for example, the [[working class]] has often been, for Marx, beguiled by nationalism, organized religion, and other distractions.  These ideological devices help to keep people from realizing that it is they who produce wealth, they who deserve the fruits of the land, all who can prosper: instead of literally thinking for themselves, they think the thoughts given to them by the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm ''The Communist Manifesto'', ch. 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consciousness and the political-economy==

For Marx, consciousness is a reflection of the political economy.  A person's thoughts tend to be shaped by his or her political and economic circumstances.  He famously wrote, "It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness."

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Perhaps Marx's greatest contribution to modern thought... is his comprehensive investigation into the role of Ideology, or how social being determines consciousness, which results in certain (for the most part unconscious) belief and value systems depending on the particular economic infrastructure pertaining at the time. From a Marxian point of view all cultural artifacts--religious systems, philosophical positions, ethical values--are, naturally enough, products of consciousness and as such are subject to these ideological pressures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/philosophy/phil2.html Sullivan, Robert. The Victorian Web]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Consciousness and social movements==

Many [[social movements]] have loosely followed Marx's thinking on consciousness.  Attaining consciousness, many believe, means finding one's ''true'' historical path, as opposed to the propaganda dispensed by the ruling elites.  Thus, the [[feminist movement]] spoke of [[consciousness raising]] and many South African activists have subscribe to a [[Black Consciousness Movement]], which calls upon Blacks to pursue their "true" political trajectory (as opposed to the ideas set out by, for example, the [[apartheid]] regime).  In the latter example, for many South African Blacks, consciousness meant rejecting racist ideas about Blacks, rejecting White rule of the nation, and restoring Black identity, history, and power.

In a politically charged sense, becoming "politically conscious" is often meant to connote that people have awakened to their ''true'' political role, their ''actual'' identity.  For Marx, this meant that the working classes would become conscious of themselves as the agents of history--they would unite and share in the wealth of labor.  This, for Marx, was their historical role and their right (as opposed to working for wages, fighting wars on behalf of capitalists, and so forth).  For many African Americans, "consciousness" has meant identifying and discrediting forms of [[White supremacy]], including those internalized by Blacks.  In these uses of the term "consciousness" is truth or destiny.  These uses of political consciousness are often politically charged.  Does, for example, a Black woman lack consciousness because she generally supports a system run mostly by White male capitalists?  If she became politically conscious would she think differently?  What is her "true" consciousness supposed to look like?

Many marxists, feminists, African Americans (and other groups), have ceased to argue that there is one true form of consciousness.  Instead, while preserving a sense that the ruling class perpetuates a [[dominant ideology]] and often behaves in ways which harm people, many dissenters now hold a more liberal position which tolerates a variety of political positions.  The complexities of political consciousness are described by the theories of [[cultural hegemony]].

{{selfref|For information about user preferences on Wikipedia, see [[Help:Preferences]], or to view and modify your preferences on Wikipedia, go to [[Special:Preferences]].}}
A '''preference''' is a technical term in psychology, economics and philosophy usually used in relation to choosing between alternatives; someone has a preference for A over B if they would choose A rather than B.

Preference can also be used in insolvency terms.

==Psychology==

In [[psychology]], preferences refer to an individual’s attitude towards a set of objects, typically reflected in an explicit decision-making process (Lichtenstein &amp; Slovic, 2006). The term is also used to mean evaluative judgment in the sense of liking or disliking an object (e.g., Scherer, 2005) which is the most typical definition employed in psychology. However, it does not mean that a preference is necessarily stable over time. Preference can be notably modified by decision-making processes, such as [[choices]] (Brehm, 1956; Sharot, De Martino, &amp; Dolan, 2009), even unconsciously (see Coppin, Delplanque, Cayeux, Porcherot, &amp; Sander, 2010). Consequently, preference can be affected by a person's surroundings and upbringing in terms of geographical location, cultural background, religious beliefs, and education. These factors are found to affect preference as repeated exposure to a certain idea or concept correlates with a positive preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zajonc|first=Robert B.|last2=Markus|first2=Hazel|date=1982-09-01|title=Affective and Cognitive Factors in Preferences|url=http://jcr.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/2/123|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=123–131|doi=10.1086/208905|issn=0093-5301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==

{{main article|Preference (economics)}}

In [[economics]] and other [[social science]]s, ''preference'' refers to the set of assumptions related to ordering some alternatives, based on the degree of [[happiness]], satisfaction, [[gratification]], enjoyment, or [[utility]] they provide, a process which results in an optimal "[[choice]]" (whether real or imagined). Although economists are usually not interested in choices or preferences in themselves, they are interested in the theory of choice because it serves as a background for empirical demand analysis.

==Marketing==
Brand preference is strongly linked to brand choice that can influence the consumer decision making and activate brand purchase. "Brand preferences can be defined as the subjective, conscious and behavioral tendencies which influence consumer's predisposition toward a brand." Understanding the brand preferences of consumers will dictate the most suitable and successful Marketing Strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Prasanna Mohan Raj and Ananth, "Brand Preferences Of Newspapers- Factor Analysis Approach", Research Journal of Economics and Business Studies", Vol.5, No: 11, September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

"Preference" may also refer to non-choices, such as [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[Biology|biological]] explanations for one's preference. [[Sexual orientation]], for example, is no longer considered a sexual preference by most individuals, but is debatable based on philosophical and/or scientific ideas.

==Insolvency==
In Insolvency, the term can be used to describe when a company pays a specific creditor or group of creditors. From doing this, that creditor(s) is made better off, than other creditors. After paying the 'preferred creditor', the company seeks to go into a formal insolvency like an administration or liquidation.  There must be a desire to make the creditor better off, for them to be a preference. 
If the preference is proven, legal action can occur. It is a wrongful act of trading. Disqualification is a risk. &lt;ref name=Steven&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steven|first1=Keith|title=What Is A Preference Under The Insolvency Act 1986|url=https://www.companyrescue.co.uk/guides-knowledge/guides/what-is-a-preference-under-the-insolvency-act-1986-3748/|accessdate=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], a '''quality''' is an attribute or a [[Property (philosophy)|property]] characteristic of an [[Object (philosophy)|object]].&lt;ref name="Cargile, 1995"&gt;Cargile, J. (1995). qualities. in Honderich, T. (Ed.) (2005). ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (2nd ed.). Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]] the [[idea]] of qualities, and especially how to distinguish certain kinds of qualities from one another, remains controversial.&lt;ref name="Cargile, 1995"/&gt;

==Background==
{{further|Property (philosophy)}}
[[Aristotle]] analyzed qualities in his [[logic]]al work, the [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]. To him, qualities are [[hylomorphic]]ally–formal attributes, such as "white" or "grammatical". Categories of ''state'', such as "shod" and "armed" are also non–[[essential property|essential]] qualities ''([[sumbebekos|katà symbebekós]])''.&lt;ref name="MIT_Cat_70"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.1.1.html#70 |author=Edghill, E.M. trans. |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Aristotle ''Categories'' |publisher=MIT |year=2009}} line 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle observed: "one and the selfsame substance, while retaining its identity, is yet capable of admitting contrary qualities. The same individual person is at one time white, at another black, at one time warm, at another cold, at one time good, at another bad. This capacity is found nowhere else... it is the peculiar mark of substance that it should be capable of admitting contrary qualities; for it is by itself changing that it does so".&lt;ref name="MIT_Cat_254"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.1.1.html#254 |author=Edghill, E.M. trans. |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Aristotle ''Categories'' |publisher=MIT |year=2009}} line 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle described four types of qualitative opposites: ''correlatives,'' ''contraries,'' ''privatives'' and ''positives.''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.3.3.html#254 |author=Edghill, E.M. trans. |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Aristotle ''Categories'' |publisher=MIT |year=2009}} line 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Locke]] presented a distinction between primary and secondary qualities in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. For Locke, a quality is an [[idea]] of a [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]] or a [[perception]]. Locke further asserts that qualities can be divided in two kinds: primary and secondary qualities. [[Primary qualities]] are [[intrinsic]] to an object—a thing or a person—whereas [[secondary qualities]] are dependent on the interpretation of the subjective mode and the context of appearance.&lt;ref name="Cargile, 1995"/&gt; For example, a [[shadow]] is a secondary quality. It requires a certain [[light]]ing to be applied to an object. For another example, consider the [[mass]] of an object. [[Weight]] is a secondary quality since, as a [[measurement]] of gravitational [[force]], it varies depending on the [[distance]] to, and mass of, very massive objects like the [[Earth]], as described by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law]]. It could be thought that mass is intrinsic to an object, and thus a primary quality. In the context of [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], the idea of mass quantifying an amount of [[matter#Relativity|matter]] requires caution. The [[relativistic mass]] varies for variously traveling observers; then there is the idea of rest mass or [[invariant mass]] (the magnitude of the [[Four-momentum|energy-momentum 4-vector]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin F. Taylor|Taylor, Edwin F.]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, John Archibald]], ''Spacetime Physics'', 2nd edition, 1991, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;), basically a system's relativistic mass in its own [[rest frame]] of reference. (Note, however, that Aristotle drew a distinction between qualification and quantification; a thing's quality can vary in degree).&lt;ref name="studman 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-categories/#Quality |author=Studtmann,P. |year=2007 |title=Aristotle's Categories |editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=E.N. |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |location=Stanford |quote=[Regarding] ''Habits and Dispositions; Natural Capabilities and Incapabilities; Affective Qualities and Affections;'' and ''Shapes;'' [...] Ackrill finds Aristotle's division of quality at best unmotivated.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only an [[isolated system]]'s invariant [[Mass in general relativity|mass in relativity]] is the same as observed in variously traveling observers' rest frames, and [[Conserved quantity|conserved]] in reactions; moreover, a system's heat, including the energy of its massless particles such as photons, contributes to the system's invariant mass (indeed, otherwise even an isolated system's invariant mass would not be conserved in reactions); even a cloud of photons traveling in different directions has, as a whole, a rest frame and a rest energy equivalent to invariant mass.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin F. Taylor|Taylor, Edwin F.]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, John Archibald]], ''Spacetime Physics'', 2nd edition, 1991, pp. 226-227 and 232-233.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, to treat rest mass (and by that stroke, rest energy) as an intrinsic quality distinctive of physical matter raises the question of what is to count as physical matter. Little of the invariant mass of a [[hadron]] (for example a [[proton]] or a [[neutron]]) consists in the invariant masses of its component [[quark]]s (in a proton, around 1%) apart from their [[gluon]] [[Quantum field theory|particle field]]s; most of it consists in the [[quantum chromodynamics binding energy]] of the (massless) gluons (see [[Quark#Mass]]).

==Conceptions of quality as metaphysical and ontological==
{{main article|Qualia}}
[[Philosophy]] and [[common sense]] tend to see qualities as [[relate]]d either to [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[feeling]]s or to [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] [[fact]]s. The qualities of something depends on the criteria being applied to and, from a [[neutrality (philosophy)|neutral point of view]], do not determine its value (the [[philosophical value]] as well as [[economic value]]). Subjectively, something might be [[form of the good|good]] because it is [[utility|useful]], because it is [[Beauty|beautiful]], or simply because it [[existence|exists]]. Determining or finding qualities therefore involves [[understanding]] what is useful, what is beautiful and what exists. Commonly, ''quality'' can mean degree of [[excellence]], as in, "a quality product" or "work of average quality". It can also refer to a property of something such as "the [[addictive]] quality of [[nicotine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'', [[Robert M. Pirsig]] examines concepts of quality in [[classicism|classical]] and [[Romanticism|romantic]], seeking a [[Metaphysics of Quality]] and a reconciliation of those views in terms of [[non-dualism|non-dualistic]] [[holism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8137">'''Regifting''' or '''regiving''' is the act of taking a [[gift]] that has been received and giving it to somebody else, sometimes in the guise of a new gift.  One example of a formalization of this activity are the [[white elephant gift exchange]]s, in which items can be regifted from year to year.
{{quotation|Wilmington's mayor, Don Betz, admits that he's a regifter, lured to the dark side of gift-giving by a sister in New York who sends bright, flashy polyester shirts every year. 'I'd never wear them,' Mr. Betz said. 'I try to give them to someone who can use them.'|Mayor Don Betz|December 1995, Wilmington Star-News&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Wilmington Star-News (Wilmington, NC)|date=1995-12-03|title=The Gift You Keep On Giving|author=Maile Carpenter|page=1D}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the USA, "[[National Regifting Day]]" is December 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=2008-12-02|title=The Social Butterfly; Do you regift? Get ready for National Regifting Day!|author=Jennifer Brett|quote=The official holiday was created three years ago by a debt-counseling group called Money Management International as a way of espousing recycling and avoiding debt.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, eBay marketed "National Re-gifting Week" as December 26–30 (December 26 being [[Boxing Day]], a time traditionally associated with gift-giving).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Daily Herald-Tribune|date=2007-12-27|title='re-gifting' trend hits a new low|author=Roy Clancy|quote=In the 'spirit of giving and regiving', eBay Canada is offering five free listings to each of its users during its 'National Re-Gifting Week', Dec. 26 to Dec. 30.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regiving differs from straightforward giving in that goods are not acquired specifically for donation. Typically, goods that have been received as a gift are offered to others, unbeknown to them that it was originally a gift to the person offering it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Meadow Lake Progress (Saskatchewan, Canada)|date=2008-12-14|title=The spirit of re-giving|author=Jennifer Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the motives are principally charitable but also includes giving items which are surplus to one's needs.

However, re-gifting also refers the means of giving away unwanted gifts as a way of disposing them.   Consider the "[[fruitcake]] gift" scenario.  Someone receives a fruitcake but they don't like (or want) fruitcake but think someone else might. They give it away to someone who also may not like fruitcake either.

Regiving differs from [[recycling]] in that recycling is most often associated with breaking components down and rebuilding into new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term {{Anchor|Etymology}}==
The term was popularized by an episode of the [[NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'' ("[[The Label Maker]]"), although the practice pre-dates the term substantially.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/New-Words/041220-regifting.htm "Word of the Week"], by Kerry Maxwell, ''Macmillan English Dictionary''.  Retrieved April 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Sacramento Bee (California)|date=2006-12-10|title='Tis better to regift than to receive; Once parodied in a 'Seinfeld' episode, it's now acceptable to foist your unwanted presents on someone else|author=Cynthia Hubert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Times|location=London|date=2006-12-26|title=With regifting, that awful present is just for Christmas, not for life|author=Chris Ayres|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, the character [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] calls [[List of Seinfeld minor characters#timwhatley|Dr. Tim Whatley]] a "regifter" after he gives [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry Seinfeld]] a label-maker that was originally given to Whatley by Elaine.

Another variant introduced in ''[[Seinfeld]]'' is degifting (see [[Indian giver]]), which refers to the act of demanding a gift back from the receiver.

==Etiquette==
Several rules of [[etiquette]] are proposed in popular media regarding regifting; they include rewrapping the gift, not using the gift before regifting it, and not giving the gift back to the original gift-giver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/Advice/12RulesForRegiftingWithoutFear.aspx 12 rules for 'regifting' without fear], by MP Dunleavey, ''MSN Money''. Retrieved April 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Telegraph Herald (Dubuque, IA)|date=2007-12-23|title=Holiday ethics: How to tactfully regift it|author=Bruce Weinstein|page=E14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regifting has become a popular addition to many white elephant gift exchanges or yankee swap events. There are no rules that specifically prohibit or encourage the practice of regifting at these parties, but generally the host of the party suggests regifting if it is an option. However, if the host suggests a spending limit for the party, it is generally poor etiquette to regift in lieu of making a purchase. The online variations of these exchanges eliminate this situation through their online purchasing requirements.

A variant of regifting was mentioned as one of [[Oprah's Favorite Things]] during the [[2008 financial crisis|recession]]-themed 2008 episode.

A [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] PublicMind Poll in Dec. 2010 showed that regifting was "commonplace."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Kwoh, "Four in 10 New Jerseyans have regifted presents, poll finds," ''Star-Ledger'', Dec. 21, 2010, p. C1.&lt;/ref&gt; Burçak Ertimur, one of the investigators in the study, and a professor of marketing at FDU, said “The popularity of regifting is driven by many things for different people. For some, it’s thrift in difficult economic times, or it’s a way to get around annoyingly high expectations about gift-giving. It’s also awareness of, or guilt over, how much stuff goes into the landfill. But the main reason might be just the sheer volume of stuff we have,” she said.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hester, Sr., "Regifting’s popularity driven by many factors," New Jersey Newsroom. Dec. 20, 2010 accessed at http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/style/regiftings-popularity-driven-by-many-factors&lt;/ref&gt;

Regifting has recently become more acceptable when it was adopted by environmentally and budgetary conscious people that encourage the [[Green Gifting]] concept.&lt;ref name="shuuk"&gt;{{cite web|author=The Shuuk|title=Home Gift Ideas|url=http://www.theshuuk.com/shuuk-tamara-kleinberg-in-the-news/|accessdate=14 November 2013|date=11 February 2013|publisher=The Shuuk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128162041/http://www.theshuuk.com/shuuk-tamara-kleinberg-in-the-news/|archivedate=28 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Solid principles}}
In [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented computer programming]], '''SOLID''' is a [[mnemonic]] [[acronym]] for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and [[Software maintenance|maintainable]]. It is not related to the [[GRASP (object-oriented design)|GRASP]] software design principles. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by [[Robert C. Martin]].&lt;ref name="ub-old-web-solid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod |title=Principles Of OOD |author=[[Robert C.

In [[drama]], a '''scene'''  is a unit of action, often a subdivision of an [[Act (drama)|act]]. 

==French scene==
A "French scene" is a scene in which the beginning and end are marked by a change in the presence of characters onstage, rather than by the lights going up or down or the set being changed.&lt;ref name="George"&gt;George, Kathleen (1994) ''Playwriting: The First Workshop'', Focal Press, {{ISBN|978-0-240-80190-2}}, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obligatory scene==
From the French ''scène à faire'', an obligatory scene is a scene (usually highly charged with emotion) which is anticipated by the audience and provided by an obliging playwright. An example is ''[[Hamlet]]'' 3.4, when Hamlet confronts his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|authorlink=J. A. Cuddon|editor=C. E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2684">In [[philosophy]], a '''state of affairs''' ({{lang-de|Sachverhalt}}), also known as a '''situation''', is a way the [[actual world]] must be in order to make some given ''proposition'' about the actual world true; in other words, a state of affairs (situation) is a ''truth-maker'', whereas a [[proposition]] is a ''truth-bearer''. Whereas states of affairs (situations) either ''obtain'' or ''fail-to-obtain'', propositions are either ''true'' or ''false''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/states-of-affairs/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[David Malet Armstrong]] is well known for his defence of a '''factualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, a position according to which the world is a world of facts and not a world of things.&lt;ref&gt;David Armstrong, ''A World of States of Affairs'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In a sense of "state of affairs" favored by [[Ernest Sosa]], states of affairs are situational [[Condition (philosophy)|conditions]]. In fact, in the ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'',&lt;ref name=Sosa&gt;[[Ernest Sosa]], 1999. "Condition".  ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''.  R.Audi, Ed.  Cambridge: Cambridge UP. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Sosa defines a condition to be a state of affairs, "way things are" or situation—most commonly referred to by a [[nominalization]] of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. The expression "Snow's being white", which refers to the condition snow's being white, is a nominalization of the sentence "Snow is white".&lt;ref name=Sosa/&gt; "The [[truth]] of the proposition that "snow is white" is a nominalization of the sentence "the proposition that snow is white is true". Snow's being white is a necessary and sufficient condition for the truth of the proposition that snow is white. Conditions in this sense may be called situational.

Usually, [[necessity and sufficiency]] relate conditions of the same kind. Being an animal is a necessary attributive condition for being a dog.  Fido's being an animal is a necessary situational condition for Fido's being a dog.

'''Sustainable landscape architecture''' is a category of [[sustainable design]] concerned with the planning and design of outdoor space.&lt;ref name=nytimes_landscape&gt;{{cite web|last=Orr|first=Stephen|title=A Sustainability That Aims to Seduce|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/garden/21sustainable.html?pagewanted=all&amp;action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=cserbias%3Aw%2C[%22RI%3A1%22%2C%22RI%3A3%22]&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%23%2FSustainable%2Blandscape%2Barchitecture%2F|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This can include ecological, politically correct, social and economic aspects of sustainability. For example, the design of a [[Sustainable urban drainage systems|sustainable urban drainage system]] can: improve habitats for [[fauna]] and [[flora]]; improve recreational facilities, because people love to be beside water; save money, because building culverts is expensive and floods cause severe financial harm.

The design of a [[green roof]] or a [[roof garden]] can also contribute to the sustainability of a [[landscape architecture]] project. The roof will help manage surface water, provide for [[wildlife]] and provide for [[recreation]].

Sustainability appears to be a new addition to the traditional [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] objectives of the design process: a structure must be solid, useful, and beautiful (''firmitas'', ''utilitas'', ''venustas''). But it can be seen as an aspect of both solidity and usefulness: an outdoor space is likely to last longer and give more usefulness to its owners if it requires low inputs of energy, water, fertiliser etc., and if it produces fewer outputs of noise, [[pollution]], [[surface water runoff]] etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1639">In [[mathematics]], the '''tensor representations''' of the [[general linear group]] are those that are obtained by taking finitely many [[tensor product]]s of the fundamental representation and its dual.  The irreducible factors of such a representation are also called tensor representations, and can be obtained by applying [[Schur functor]]s (associated to [[Young tableaux]]).  These coincide with the [[rational representation]]s of the general linear group.

More generally, a [[matrix group]] is any subgroup of the general linear group.  A tensor representation of a matrix group is any representation that is contained in a tensor representation of the general linear group.  For example, the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n'') admits a tensor representation on the space of all trace-free symmetric tensors of order two.  For orthogonal groups, the tensor representations are contrasted with the [[spin representation]]s.

The [[classical group]]s, like the [[symplectic group]], have the property that all finite-dimensional representations are tensor representations (by [[Weyl's construction]]), while other representations (like the [[metaplectic representation]]) exist in infinite dimensions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3935">{{About|the metaphor|the short story by Edgar Allan Poe|The Imp of the Perverse (short story) }}

'''The Imp of the Perverse''' is a [[metaphor]] for the urge to do exactly the wrong thing in a given situation for the sole reason that it is possible for wrong to be done.  The impulse is compared to an [[imp]] (a small [[demon]]) which leads an otherwise decent person into mischief.

==Poe’s short stories==
The phrase has a long history in [[literature]], and was popularized (and perhaps coined) by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] in his short story, "[[The Imp of the Perverse (short story)|The Imp of the Perverse]]".

{{quote|We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We know that it will be ruinous to make delay. The most important crisis of our life calls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy and action. ... It must, it shall be undertaken to-day, and yet we put it off until to-morrow, and why?

* The Imp of the Perverse is also exemplified in "Le Mauvais Vitrier" ("The Bad Glazier"), a prose poem by [[Charles Baudelaire]].
* The concept also figures prominently in the motives of [[Jack Shaftoe]], a [[swashbuckling]] protagonist in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s trilogy ''[[The Baroque Cycle]]'':

{{Quote|But here was a rare opportunity for stupidity even more flagrant and glorious.

Now, Bob, who'd been observing Jack carefully for many years, had observed that when these moments arrived, Jack was almost invariably possessed by something that Bob had heard about in Church called the Imp of the Perverse.  Bob was convinced that the Imp of the Perverse rode invisibly on Jack's shoulder whispering bad ideas into his ear, and that the only counterbalance was Bob himself, standing alongsides counseling good sense, prudence, caution, and other Puritan virtues.

But Bob was in England.|from ''[[Quicksilver (novel)|Quicksilver]]''}}

* [[Eric Berne]] saw what he called the "demon" in the self as the (vocalisation of) a primitive [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]] impulse, citing the instance of a stockbroker who at the key moment "heard a demonic whisper telling him: 'Don't sell, buy'. He abandoned his carefully planned campaign, and lost his entire capital - 'Ha, ha,' he said".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 135 and p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6510">{{for|the book by Marshall McLuhan|The Medium Is the Massage}}
{{Primary sources|date = July 2013}}"'''The medium is the message'''" is a phrase coined by [[Marshall McLuhan]] meaning that the form of a [[media (communication)|medium]] embeds itself in any [[message]] it would transmit or convey, creating a symbiotic relationship by which the medium influences how the message is perceived.

== Publications ==
The phrase was introduced in McLuhan's book ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'', published in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Originally published in 1964 by Mentor, New York; reissued 1994, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts with an introduction by [[Lewis H. Lapham|Lewis Lapham]]&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan proposes that a medium itself, not the content it carries, should be the focus of study. He said that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not only by the [[Content (media)|content]] delivered over the medium, but also by the characteristics of the medium itself.

McLuhan frequently punned on the word "message", changing it to "mass age", "mess age", and "massage"; a later book, ''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'' was originally to be titled ''The Medium is the Message'', but McLuhan preferred the new title, which is said to have been a [[The Medium Is the Massage#Origin of the title|printing error]].

Concerning the title, McLuhan wrote "The title “The Medium Is the Massage" is a teaser—a way of getting attention. There’s a wonderful sign hanging in a Toronto junkyard which reads, “Help Beautify Junkyards. Throw Something Lovely Away Today.” This is a very effective way of getting people to notice a lot of things. And so the title is intended to draw attention to the fact that a medium is not something neutral—it does something to people. It takes hold of them. It rubs them off, it massages them and bumps them around, chiropractically, as it were, and the general roughing up that any new society gets from a medium, especially a new medium, is what is intended in that title."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McLuhan |first=Marshall |date=1967-03-19 |title=McLuhan: Now The Medium Is The Massage |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/03/19/107185353.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=179 |work=New York Times |access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts ==

For McLuhan, it was the medium itself that shaped and controlled "the scale and form of human association and action".&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the movie as an example, he argued that the way this medium played with conceptions of speed and time transformed "the world of sequence and connections into the world of creative configuration and structure."&lt;ref name="page-12"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the message of the movie medium is this transition from "lineal connections" to "configurations".&lt;ref name="page-12" /&gt;

Extending the argument for understanding the medium as the message itself, he proposed that the "content of any medium is always another medium"&lt;ref name="page-8"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; – thus, speech is the content of writing, writing is the content of print, and print itself is the content of the telegraph.

McLuhan understood "medium" in a broad sense. He identified the light bulb as a clear demonstration of the concept of "the medium is the message". A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence."&lt;ref name="page-8" /&gt;

Likewise, the message of a newscast about a heinous crime may be less about the individual news story itself — the content — and more about the change in public attitude towards crime that the newscast engenders by the fact that such crimes are in effect being brought into the home to watch over dinner.&lt;ref name="Federman" /&gt;

Hence in ''Understanding Media'', McLuhan describes the "content" of a medium as a juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar  to distract the watchdog of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1964) Understanding Media, Routledge, London&lt;/ref&gt; This means that people tend to focus on the obvious, which is the content, to provide us valuable information, but in the process, we largely miss the structural changes in our affairs that are  introduced subtly, or over long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Federman"&gt;Federman, M. (2004, July 23). What is the Meaning of the Medium is the Message? Retrieved &lt;Oct 9, 2008&gt; from http://individual.utoronto.ca/markfederman/article_mediumisthemessage.htm .&lt;/ref&gt; As society's values, norms, and ways of doing things change because of the technology, it is then we realize the social implications of the medium.  These range from cultural or religious issues and historical precedents, through interplay with existing conditions, to the secondary or tertiary effects in a cascade of interactions&lt;ref name="Federman" /&gt; that we are not aware of.

On the subject of [[art history]], McLuhan interpreted [[Cubism]] as announcing clearly that the medium is the message. For him, Cubist art required "instant sensory awareness of the whole"&lt;ref name="page-13"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than perspective alone. In other words, with Cubism one could not ask what the artwork was about (content),&lt;ref name="page-13" /&gt; but rather consider it in its entirety.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3726">'''Violence-Free Zones''', or Violence-Free Zone Initiatives, are community-based interventions for gang members and youth. Zones attempt to stem violence by providing mentorship, guidance, social development, job training and an effective environment for learning, among other tools, to help gang members and at-risk youth break free and become successful in life, crime-free and violence-free.&lt;ref name="National Gang Center"&gt;[http://www.nationalgangcenter.gov/SPT/Programs/130] National Gang Center: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention&lt;/ref&gt; The initiatives operate in urban schools with high levels of crime and violence.&lt;ref name="Center for Neighborhood Enterprise"&gt;[http://www.cneonline.org/reducing-youth-violence-the-violence-free-zone/] Center for Neighborhood Enterprise&lt;/ref&gt;   

The model for Violence-Free Zones was developed by the [[Center for Neighborhood Enterprise]]&lt;ref name="Center for Neighborhood Enterprise"/&gt; and is based on the principle that lack of parental involvement and guidance is at the root of violence among youth in these high-risk communities.&lt;ref name="National Gang Center"/&gt;

Participating cities include Washington, D.C., Hartford, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, Milwaukee,&lt;ref name="Violence-free program helps students"&gt;[http://www.wuwm.com/news/wuwm_news.php?articleid=4608] Violence-free program helps students turn their lives around; WUWM NPR radio, May 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Richmond (Virginia) and others. 

The model has also been adopted as a strategy to prevent HIV/AIDS transmission in schools.&lt;ref name="Global AIDS Alliance"&gt;[http://toolkit.ineesite.org/toolkit/INEEcms/uploads/1041/Best_Practices_Violence_Free_Zone.PDF] Global AIDS alliance; retrieved November 1, 2012 via Interagency Network for Education in Emergencies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program components==

Each Violence-Free Zone engages youth-oriented organizations in the area to become "Community Partners."  These organizations must have the trust and confidence of local youth.  Key to the program are Youth Advisors, young adults from the neighborhood who have overcome similar obstacles and have the respect of students. The Advisors work in the schools, coaching and mediating, and serve as mentors to the most troubled students.  Community Partners and the school work together to provide guidance, social development, job readiness programs. Training, oversight, and technical assistance for the program administrators is provided by the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise.&lt;ref name="Center for Neighborhood Enterprise"/&gt;

==Results==

The initiative has been found to have measurable success in each targeted metric, from school absences and incidents to police arrests.&lt;ref name="MJC"&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/88914992.html] Violence-Free Zone reduces crime around schools, new research says; Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, March 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Academic Achievement and Violence Free Zones"&gt;[http://blog.heritage.org/2009/11/26/academic-achievement-and-violence-free-zones/] Academic Achievement and Violence Free Zones; The Foundry blog, November 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Independent evaluations, including a study by [[Baylor University]],&lt;ref name="Baylor"&gt;[http://www.baylor.edu/mediacommunications/news.php?action=story&amp;story=73859] Baylor University Study Finds Violence-Reduction Program Improves Safety and Attendance and Decreases Need for Police in Richmond, Va., High School, May 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; have shown declines in each zone from 4% to 61%.&lt;ref name="Violence-Free Zone Results"&gt;[http://www.cneonline.org/results-and-evaluations/] Violence-Free Zone Results&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Conference on Women, 1985''' or the '''Third World Conference on Women''' took place between 15 and 26 July 1985 in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, as the end-decade assessment of progress and failure in implementing the goals established by the [[World Plan of Action]] from the [[World Conference on Women, 1975|1975 inaugural conference on women]] as modified by the [[World Programme of Action]] of the [[World Conference on Women, 1980|second conference]]. Of significance during the conference was the end result of the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 40/108|Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women]] being adopted by [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]], unlike the previous two conferences. The conference marked the first time that [[lesbian rights]] were introduced in a UN official meeting and the turning-point for [[violence against women]] to emerge from being a hidden topic into one which needed to be addressed. Recognizing that the goals of the [[International Women's Year|Decade for Women]] had not been met, the conference recommended and the General Assembly approved on-going evaluation of women's achievements and failures through the year 2000.

==History==

In 1975, the United Nations approved the celebration of [[International Women's Year]]. As part of the celebrations they held the First World Conference on Women in 1975 in [[Mexico City]]. At that meeting, it was proposed that the following decade be proclaimed UN Decade for Women and follow-up meetings to assess progress be held in 1980 and 1985. The General Assembly adopted a World Plan of Action with recommended targets for governments to integrate women's equality, development and participation in peace initiatives. The mid-point meeting was held in [[Copenhagen]],{{sfn|Earth Summit|2002}} adding sections to the revised Programme of Action devoted to ensuring women equal access to education, employment opportunities, and adequate health care.{{sfn|Women's World Conferences|2008}} Both of the previous conferences had struggled with the divide caused by [[Cold War]] politics and the needs of the developing world.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|pp=5–7}}{{sfn|West|1999|p=180}} The geopolitical backdrop entering into the third conference was still contentious with a [[Early 1980s recession|worldwide debt crisis]] soaring in [[Economic history of Africa#Independence and the Cold War|Africa]] and [[Latin American debt crisis|Latin America]], protectionist policies under [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] causing widespread uncertainty, [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|stagnation of the USSR]], the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|arms race]] build up, and the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. The question would be whether the conference could remain focused on women's issues in the face of Soviet accusations that the United States imperialistic and war mongering tactics were undermining the goals of the Decade for Women and the US concerns that the [[Eastern Bloc]] attempts at politicization would derail any real improvement in the unique problems faced by women.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|pp=7–8}}

==Official conference==

The 1985 Conference held from 15 and 26 July in [[Nairobi]], Kenya was the final review of the decade{{sfn|Women's World Conferences|2008}} and was led by conference president [[Margaret Kenyatta (mayor)|Margaret Kenyatta]].{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=7}} [[Leticia Ramos-Shahani|Leticia Shahani]], widowed mother of three children and a [[Philippines|Philippine]] diplomat served as the Secretary-General and made the crucial suggestion that off-the-record discussion by delegates would decrease the polarity which had plagued the previous conferences and would allow a more open discussion and lead to compromise.{{sfn|Fraser|2013}} There were 157 countries represented with around 1,400 official delegates, including such prominent delegates as: [[Phoebe Asiyo]] of [[Kenya]]; [[Ylva Ericsson]] of [[Sweden]]; Saida Hassan of [[Djibouti]];{{sfn|''The Salina Journal''|1985|p=6}} {{ill|Elena Lagadinova|bg|Елена Лагадинова}} of [[Bulgaria]];{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=104}} [[Carolyn McAskie]] an official at the [[Canadian International Development Agency]];{{sfn|''Awareness Times''|2007}} [[Maureen O'Neill]] head of the Canadian delegation, who was the coordinator for the [[Minister of Status of Women]];{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=9}}{{sfn|''The Chilliwack Progress''|1986|p=12}} [[Maureen Reagan]], daughter of the US president;{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=9}} [[Yvette Roudy]], the French Minister of Women's Rights;{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=48}} [[Jean Spautz]] of [[Luxembourg]];{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=12}} [[Tom Vraalsen]] of [[Norway]]; among others.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=104}}

After opening remarks by [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]],{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=98}} Kenyan President [[Daniel arap Moi]] welcomed participants, expressing his hope that the conference would prove successful and that the objectives for women would not be obscured by distractions.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=100}} Opening remarks by Margaret Kenyatta on the history of the conference were followed by the general discussion.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=101}} The general session discussed that women ought to be able to live securely under conditions which granted them equality and justice, but there was a recognition that time is required to change traditional views and make people aware of needed change. It was noted that though legal equality had significantly improved, the disparity between the legal reality and practice was still broad. It was discussed that political tension and instability, as well as conflict added to curtailment of advancement, as did colonialism, racism, and economic stagnation.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|pp=109–111}} The conference noted gains in developed nations for parity of education, but significant gaps in girls education versus boys education in developing nations, which impacted future employment options as well.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=117}} Though some progress had been made on women's employment, it was noted that wage gaps, higher unemployment for women than men, and child care services all contributed to women's instability. As for health, it was acknowledged that as women were typically the health care providers for their families, that more effort must be made to ensure that women were healthy to allow them to continue to serve their families. Inadequate education and health facilities, combined with high birth rates and customs or laws that allowed women to control their own fertility were continuing issues.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|pp=117–118}}

Projects throughout the decade had drawn awareness to the need to advance women's opportunities and statistic gathering had improved to measure their progress or lack of advancement. Violence against women was a prevalent problem as was the insecurity of indigenous women, elderly women, migrant and refugee women and their children, and rural women. Water and food uncertainty needed to be addressed as women in many areas devoted the majority of their time into unpaid labors to maintain their families.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|pp=119–120}} Many UN programs had been expanded over the Decade for Women to incorporate women into their development programs, though it was noted that in general women's participation, and even employment in UN agencies though improved was still below targets. Programs directed at agriculture, economics, children, development, housing, health, technology and many others were examined and overall, improvement had been made in the inclusion of women's access. However, it was noted that making provisions for equality was not the same as attaining real equal opportunity.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|pp=121–125}} It was agreed that the cultural role in maintaining [[sexism]] and sex [[stereotypes]] was a complex issue which would involve dedicated effort to change school curricula and transform media messaging to enable women real access to socio-economic, cultural, legal and political parity.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|pp=126–127}} It was noted that for the first time, [[lesbian rights]] were introduced at an official UN conference by the Dutch delegate, [[Annelien Kappeyne van de Coppello]].{{sfn|Bunch|Hinojosa|2000|p=11}}{{sfn|Swiebel|2015|pp=1–2}}

The first committee, under the chair [[Cecilia López Montaño|Cecilia López]] of [[Colombia]], with vice-chairs, [[Begum Kulsum Saifullah Khan|Kulsum Saifullah]] of [[Pakistan]], [[Olimpia Solomonescu]] of [[Romania]], and [[Laetitia van den Assum]] of the [[Netherlands]], with Rapporteur [[Diaroumeye Gany]] of [[Niger]],{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=104}} discussed the first three chapters of the draft ''Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women''.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=129}} The second committee, under the chair [[Rosario Manalo]] of the [[Philippines]], with vice-chairs, Dame [[Billie Miller]] of [[Barbados]], [[Konjit SineGiorgis]] of [[Ethiopia]], and [[Eva Szilagyi]] of [[Hungary]], with Rapporteur [[Helen Ware (academic)|Helen Ware]] of Australia,{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=104}} discussed the remaining chapters of the Strategies.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=131}} Both committees recommended approving the draft and a discussion with the general session followed with a line by line review of the document.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=143}} Though both committees evaluated a number of draft resolutions, there was inadequate time for the general session to review the resolutions and no formal action was taken upon them.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=157}}

==Forum==

Dame [[Nita Barrow]] of [[Barbados]] chaired and organized the Forum,{{sfn|Fraser|2013}} with the assistance of [[Edith Ballantyne]], president of the United Nations' Conference of Non-governmental Organizations (CONGO).{{sfn|Foster|1989|pp=95-97}}{{sfn|Winslow|1995|p=145}} It was attended by more than 15,000 people, of which 60% were representatives from non-industrialized nations, and was held at the [[University of Nairobi]].{{sfn|Fraser|2013}}{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}} Unlike the facilities in Copenhagen, in Kenya, a kindergarten was set up for delegates' children.{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=56}} A Peace Tent was set up on the lawn of the university and hosted sessions about conflict and its impact of war on women.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}} Among prominent attendees were: [[Charlotte Bunch]], a US lesbian activist ;{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}} [[Betty Friedan]], founder of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW);{{sfn|''The Telegraph''|2006}} [[Eddah Gachukia]] head of the Kenyan NGO committee;{{sfn|Sciolino|1985}} and others.

In addition to the basic themes of the official session, the Forum was asked to address issues concerning women who were poor, elderly, migrant or refugees, youth and address women in media. Round table discussions, workshops and two plenary sessions were established.{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=54}} The array of topics discussed in formal and impromptu meetings was vast, including such topics as childcare; consumer education; credit; family planning; [[female genital mutilation]]; the growth of women's studies; legal rights; literacy; [[Exploitation of women in mass media|media portrayals of women]]; motherhood and development programs for families; political prisoners; prostitution; systemic discrimination against women; violence; women and development; women and religion; women and technology; as well as lesbian workshops and many other topics in some 1200 workshops scheduled throughout the duration of the conference.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}}{{sfn|Maters|1986|pp=55–56}}{{sfn|''The San Bernardino County Sun''|1985|p=7}} The lesbian workshops were the "first public discussion of lesbianism in Kenya"{{sfn|Bunch|Hinojosa|2000|p=10}} and resulted in a lesbian press conference in which it was acknowledged that lesbianism wasn't a [[Western world|Westernized]] concept, but instead effected women's rights throughout the globe.{{sfn|Bunch|Hinojosa|2000|p=11}} It also resulted in a proposal from one of the Dutch representatives for lesbian rights to be addressed in the official conference documents.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}} In a workshop on development, [[Helen Safa]] brought forward the idea that "Gender and Development" (GAD) should replace the former strategy "Women in Development" (WID) used by the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] (CSW). This mirrored the NGO, [[Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era]] (DAWN)'s belief that WID simply tried to insert women into existing systems without reducing or changing their [[Patriarchy|paternal nature]]. They recommended that GAD, a strategic long-term planning method, become the new standard, which focused on designing systems specifically related to women and their growth.{{sfn|Bae|2004|p=9-12}}

In addition to the workshops, women were invited to participate in a number of cultural events like the Nairobi Film Forum which showed films and videos by and about women and gave workshops; exhibitions of art and photography; folklore workshops; concerts; martial arts classes; field trips to local villages.{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=55}} Because of the favorable climate conditions, women were able to gather in the open-air for a variety of both scheduled and unscheduled functions to build networks with other participants.{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=56}} The Forum after 1985 shifted in a way that reflected the divide between [[progressivism]] versus conservatism, as opposed to the polarized capitalist-socialist divide which had split prior conferences. It was recognized by the participants that global problems were women's issues, but that within their governmental systems, there was either a desire to promote or curtail change. A fundamental shift occurred which recognized that no matter the system, women were subordinate and that promoting a world view from women's perspectives allowed them to transcend their differences and focus on the commonalities they shared.{{sfn|Bae|2004|pp=20–22}} For example, aboriginal women recognized that where ever they were from, they battled for indigenous land rights; Arab and Israeli women discussed the need for peace; women lawyers whether from Islamic countries in South Asia or Catholic countries in Latin America recognized the struggle for women's rights under patriarchal religious systems.{{sfn|Sciolino|1985}}

==Outcomes==
[[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 40/108|Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women]] was adopted by consensus because of a strategy developed which allowed delegates to express reservations on the basis of individual paragraphs, rather than of the document as a whole. Because of stronger transnational relationships had been forged by the previous two conferences{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=8}} increased understanding by governments of the needs of their women constituents, a willingness of donors to help women integrate into development and increased effectiveness of NGOs in their activism, the list of topics covered in the Strategies was more extensive, including topics such as: agriculture, communications, constitutional and legal issues, education, employment, energy needs, environmental and water concerns, food security, health, housing, science and technology, social services, social and political equality as well as increased participation. The major themes development, equality, and peace were retained as were focuses on racism and refugees.{{sfn|Fraser|2013}} The document endorsed new strategies moving to the year 2000 and replaced the words [[Apartheid]] and [[Zionism]] with the more general term racism, to maintain the focus on women rather than polarizing issues.{{sfn|''The Ukiah Daily Journal''|1985|p=8}}{{sfn|''The Salina Journal''|1985|p=6}}

Out of the conference forum, several women's groups emerged that would become influential: [[Asian-Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development]] (APWLD), [[Comité de América Latina y El Caribe para la Defensa de los Derechos de la Mujer]] (CLADEM), [[Women in Law and Development in Africa]] (WILDAF),{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}} and the [[Tanzania Media Women's Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tripp|first=Aili Mari|date=January 2003|title=Women in Movement Transformations in African Political Landscapes|url=https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy2.cl.msu.edu/doi/pdf/10.1080/1461674032000080585?needAccess=true|journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=233–255|doi=10.1080/1461674032000080585|issn=1461-6742|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were indicative of the types of exponential growth in NGOs dealing with women and their issues which were founded after the conference ended. Many of the organizations were information-sharing groups which pooled their resources and strategies to create innovative solutions.{{sfn|Chen|1995|p=479}} These networks, shifted the flow of activism and scholarship from the global North toward the Southern hemispheres and from top-down social structures to those which forge coalitions across cultural, racial and social boundaries.{{sfn|Chen|1995|p=480}} The conference also marked a turning point in the silence regarding [[violence against women]], which would ultimately lead to the passage of the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in 1993.{{sfn|Pietilä|1999|p=17}} Since the objectives of the Decade for Women had not achieved the goals set out in 1975, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] made a decision after Nairobi to conduct world surveys on women every five years in a continuing effort to follow-up on the implementation of the Strategies for women.{{sfn|Pietilä|1999|pp=23–24}} One of the most important outcomes was moving women out of obscurity and establishing specific mechanisms for measuring women's progress.{{sfn|Zinsser|1990|p=22}}
