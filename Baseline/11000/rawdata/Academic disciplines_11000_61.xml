      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11326">The ABC software metric was introduced by Jerry Fitzpatrick in 1997 to overcome the drawbacks of the LOC.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Jerry|date=1997|title=Applying the ABC metric to C, C++ and Java|url=http://www.softwarerenovation.com/ABCMetric.pdf|journal=C++ Report|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The metric defines an ABC score as a triplet of values that represent the size of a set of source code statements. An ABC score is calculated by counting the number of [[Assignment (computer science)|assignments]] (A), number of [[Branch (computer science)|branches]] (B), and number of [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditionals]] (C) in a program. ABC score can be applied to individual [[Method (computer programming)|methods]], [[Function computer science|functions]], [[Class (computer programming)|classes]], [[modular programming|modules]] or [[File (computing)|files]] within a program.

ABC score is represented by a [[3d vector|3-D vector]] &lt; Assignments (A), Branches (B), Conditionals (C) &gt;. It can also be represented as a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] value, which is the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the vector &lt; Assignments (A), Branches (B), Conditionals (C) &gt;, and is calculated as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;|&lt;ABCvector&gt;| = \surd(A^2 + B^2 + C^2)&lt;/math&gt;

By convention, an ABC magnitude value is rounded to the nearest tenth.

== History ==
The concept of measuring software size was first introduced by Maurice Halstead&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elements of Software Science|last=Halstead|first=Maurice|publisher=Elsevier|year=1977|isbn=|location=North Holland|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Purdue University in 1975. He suggested that every computer program consists mainly of [[Software token|tokens]]: [[Operator (computer programming)|operators]] and [[operand]]s. He concluded that a count of the number of unique operators and operands gives us a measure of the size of the program. However, this was not adopted as a measure of the size of a program.

[[Source lines of code|Lines of code]] (LOC) was another popular measure of the size of a program. The LOC was not considered an accurate measure of the size of the program because even a program with identical functionality may have different numbers of lines depending on the style of coding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fenton|first=Norman E.|date=1991|title=Software Metrics: Successes, Failures and New Directions|url=https://www.agileconnection.com/sites/default/files/article/file/2014/Software%20Metrics-%20Successes,%20Failures,%20and%20New%20Directions.pdf|journal=Chapman &amp; Hall|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another metric called the [[Function point|Function Point]] (FP) metric was introduced to calculate the number of user input and output transactions. The function point calculations did not give information about both the functionality of the program and about the routines that were involved in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitchenham|first=Barbara|date=December 1995|title=Towards a Framework for Software Measurement Validation|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c0cb/2b8e826a19567b9e1c356a1d0063fb913e9f.pdf|journal=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering|volume=21|issue=12|doi=10.1109/32.489070|pages=929–944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABC metric is intended to overcome the drawbacks of the LOC, FP and token (operation and operand) counts. However, an FP score can also be used to supplement an ABC score.

Though the author contends that the ABC metric measures size, some believe that it measures complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Jerry|date=2017|title=Timeless Laws of Software Development|publisher=Software Renovation Corporation|isbn=978-0999335604|chapter=Appendix A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of the ABC metric to measure complexity depends on how complexity is defined.

== Definition ==
The three components of the ABC score are defined as following:

* Assignment: storage or transfer of data into a [[Variable (computer science)|variable]].
* Branches: an explicit forward program branch out of [[Scope (computer science)|scope]].
* Conditionals: [[Boolean data type|Boolean]] or logic test.

Since basic languages such as C, C++, Java, etc. have operations like assignments of variables, function calls and test conditions only, the ABC score has these three components.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

If the ABC vector is denoted as &lt;5,11,9&gt; for a [[subroutine]], it means that the subroutine has 5 assignments, 11 branches and 9 conditionals. For standardization purposes, the counts should be enclosed in angle brackets and written in the same order per the notation &lt;A, B, C&gt;.

It is often more convenient to compare source code sizes using a scalar value. The individual ABC counts are distinct so, per Jerry Fitzpatrick, we consider the three components to be [[Orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]], allowing a scalar ABC magnitude to be computed as shown above.

Scalar ABC scores lose some of the benefits of the vector. Instead of computing a vector magnitude, the [[weighted sum]] of the vectors may support more accurate size comparison. ABC scalar scores should not be presented without the accompanying ABC vectors, since the scalar values are not the complete representation of the size.

== Theory ==
The specific rules for counting ABC vector values should be interpreted differently for different languages due to [[Semantics (computer science)|semantic]] differences between them.

Therefore, the rules for calculating ABC vector slightly differ based on the language. We define the ABC metric calculation rules for C, C++ and Java below. Based on these rules the rules for other imperative languages can be interpreted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ABC rules for C ===
The following rules give the count of Assignments, Branches, Conditionals in the ABC metric for [[C (programming language)|C]]:
# Add one to the assignment count when:  
#* Occurrence of an assignment operator ('''=, *=, /=, %=, +=, &lt;&lt;=, &gt;&gt;=, &amp;=, !=, ^=''').   
#* Occurrence of an [[Increment and decrement operators|increment or a decrement operator]] ('''++, --''').
# Add one to branch count when:   
#* Occurrence of a [[Subroutine|function call]].
#* Occurrence of any [[goto]] statement which has a target at a deeper level of [[Nesting (computing)|nesting]] than the level to the goto.
# Add one to condition count when: 
#* Occurrence of a [[conditional operator]] ('''&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, !=''').    
#* Occurrence of the following [[Keyword (computer programming)|keywords]] (‘'''else'''’, ‘'''case'''’, ‘'''default'''’, ‘'''?'''’).    
#* Occurrence of a [[unary operation|unary]] conditional operator.

=== ABC rules for C++ ===
The following rules give the count of Assignments, Branches, Conditionals in the ABC metric for [[C++]]:
# Add one to the assignment count when:  
#* Occurrence of an assignment operator (exclude [[Constant (computer programming)|constant declarations]] and default [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameter assignments]]) ('''=, *=, /=, %=, +=, &lt;&lt;=, &gt;&gt;=, &amp;=, !=, ^=''').    
#* Occurrence of an increment or a decrement operator (prefix or postfix) ('''++, --''').    
#* Initialization of a variable or a nonconstant [[C++ classes|class member]].
# Add one to branch count when: 
#* Occurrence of a function call or a class method call.
#* Occurrence of any goto statement which has a target at a deeper level of nesting than the level to the goto. 
#* Occurrence of ‘new’ or ‘delete’ operators.
# Add one to condition count when:  
#* Occurrence of a conditional operator ('''&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, !=''').    
#* Occurrence of the following keywords (‘'''else'''’, ‘'''case'''’, ‘'''default'''’, ‘'''?'''’, ‘'''try'''’, ‘'''catch'''’).    
#* Occurrence of a unary conditional operator.

=== ABC rules for Java ===
The following rules give the count of Assignments, Branches, Conditionals in the ABC metric for [[Java (programming language)|Java]]:
# Add one to the assignment count when:  
#* Occurrence of an assignment operator (exclude constant declarations and default parameter assignments) ('''=, *=, /=, %=, +=, &lt;&lt;=, &gt;&gt;=, &amp;=, !=, ^=, &gt;&gt;&gt;=''').    
#* Occurrence of an increment or a decrement operator (prefix or postfix) ('''++, --''').
# Add one to branch count when 
#* Occurrence of a function call or a class method call.    
#* Occurrence of a ‘new’ operator.
# Add one to condition count when:   
#* Occurrence of a conditional operator ('''&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, !=''').    
#* Occurrence of the following keywords (‘'''else'''’, ‘'''case'''’, ‘'''default'''’, ‘'''?'''’, ‘'''try'''’, ‘'''catch'''’).    
#* Occurrence of a unary conditional operator.

== Applications&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==

=== Independent of style of coding ===
Since the ABC score metric is built on the idea that tasks like data storage, branching and conditional [[Software testing|testing]], this metric is independent of the user’s style of coding.

=== Project time estimation ===
ABC score calculation helps in estimating the amount of time needed to complete a project. This can be done by roughly estimating the ABC score for the project, and by calculating the ABC score of the program in a particular day. The amount of time taken for the completion for the project can be obtained by dividing the ABC score of the project by the ABC score achieved in one day.

=== Bug rate calculation ===
The [[Bug (computing)|bug]] rate was originally calculated as ''Number of bugs / LOC''. However, the LOC is not a reliable measure of the size of the program because it depends on the style of coding. A more accurate way of measuring bug rate is to count the - ''Number of bugs / ABC score''.

=== Program comparison ===
Programs written in different languages can be compared with the help of ABC scores because most languages use assignments, branches and conditional statements.

The information on the count of the individual parameters (number of assignments, branches and conditions) can help classify the program as ‘data strong’ or ‘function strong’ or ‘logic strong’. The vector form of an ABC score can provide insight into the driving principles behind the [[Application software|application]], whereas the details are lost in the scalar form of the score.

=== Linear metric ===
ABC scores are [[Linearity|linear]], so any file, module, class, function or method can be scored. For example, the (vector) ABC score for a module is the sum of the scores of its sub-modules. Scalar ABC scores, however, are non-linear.

'''Advanced Placement [[History of the United States|United States History]]''' (also known as '''AP U.S. History''' or '''APUSH''') is a course and examination offered by [[College Board]] as part of the [[Advanced Placement Program]].

==Curriculum==

The AP U.S. History course is designed to provide the same level of content and instruction that students would face in a freshman-level college survey class. AP U.S. History classes generally use a college-level textbook as the foundation for the course.

===Textbooks===
Commonly used textbooks that meet the curriculum requirements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/html/apcourseaudit/courses/us_history_textbook_list.html |title=AP United States History: Example Textbook List |publisher=CollegeBoard |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; include:

===Conservative criticism===
[[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] have criticized the curriculum for downplaying [[American exceptionalism]] and failing to foster patriotism. In 2014, [[2014 Jefferson County Public Schools protests|there were protests against it]] in the [[Jefferson County Public Schools (Colorado)|Jefferson County Public Schools district]] in Colorado. In 2015, a bill to replace the curriculum was passed by the [[Oklahoma House of Representatives]]’ Education Committee, but later withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/ap-us-history-controversy-becomes-a-debate-on-america-115381.html|title=AP U.S. History controversy becomes a debate on America -|last=Lerner|first=Adam B.|date=21 February 2015|work=[[Politico]]|publisher=Politico|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/02/23/oklahoma-legislature-targets-ap-us-history-framework-being-negative |title=Oklahoma Board of Education targets US History course for being "negative"|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exam==
The AP U.S. History exam lasts 3 hours and 15 minutes and consists of two sections; additionally, each section is divided into two parts.  Section I, part A includes 55 multiple choice questions with each question containing four choices. The multiple choice questions cover American History from [[Pre-Columbian era|just before European contact with Native Americans]] to the present day. Moreover, section I, part B includes three short-answer questions. The first two questions are required, but students choose between the third and fourth questions. In total, students are given 95 minutes (55 for the multiple choice section and 40 for three short-answer questions) to complete section I.

Section II of the exam is the free-response section, in which examinees write two [[Essay|essays]]. Section II, part A, is a [[document-based question]] (DBQ), which provides an essay prompt and seven short primary sources or excerpts related to the prompt. Students are expected to write an essay responding to the prompt in which they utilize the sources in addition to outside information. Section II, part B, provides three thematic essay prompts. Students must respond to only one of the three essay prompts. 

Each long essay essay question on the AP exam may address any one of three possible historical thinking skills: patterns of continuity and change over time, comparison, or causation. Both of the essay questions will address the same historical thinking skill. In addition, neither essay's time frame will be exclusively before 1607 (the founding of Jamestown) or after 1980 (President Reagan's election). There is a fifteen-minute reading period for students to read the essay prompts, take notes, and brainstorm; but students may begin to write the essays before this period ends. Students will then have 85 minutes to write the two essays; 45 minutes are recommended for the DBQ and 40 minutes for the long essay, but students are free to work on the two essays as they see fit.&lt;ref name="Exam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-us-history-course-and-exam-description.pdf |title=AP US History: Course and Exam Description |publisher=CollegeBoard |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the AP U.S. History Test was taken by 402,947 students worldwide,&lt;ref name="2011 Scores"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/2011_US_History_Score_Dist.pdf |title=AP United States History Student Score Distributions Global AP Exams - May 2011 |year=2011 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it second in terms of number of examinees, behind the AP English Language and Composition exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/exgrd_sum/2011.html|title=AP Data – Archived Data 2011|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401102514/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/exgrd_sum/2011.html|archive-date=2013-04-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring==
The AP U.S. History exam is divided into two sections. Section one consists of the multiple choice and short answer questions, while section two consists of the document-based question (DBQ) and a long essay question. Section one is worth 60% of the total AP exam score, with 40% of the total exam score derived from the student's performance on the multiple choice section and 20% of the total exam score derived from the student's performance on the short answer questions. The remaining 40% of the total exam score is derived from section two; the document-based question is worth 25% of the total exam score, while the long essay question is worth 15% of the total exam score.&lt;ref name="Exam"/&gt;

__NOTOC__
[[Image:Wurdi Youang.jpg|thumb|A small part of the Wurdi Youang stone arrangement]]

'''Aboriginal stone arrangements''' are a form of [[rock art]] constructed by [[Indigenous Australians]]. Typically, they consist of stones, each of which may be about 30&amp;nbsp;cm in size, laid out in a pattern extending over several metres or tens of metres. Notable examples have been made by many different [[Australian Aboriginal culture]]s, and in many case are thought to be associated with spiritual ceremonies.

Particularly fine examples are in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], where the stones can be very large (up to 1 metre high). For example, the stone arrangement at [[Wurdi Youang]] consists of about 100 stones arranged in an egg-shaped oval about 50m across. Each stone is well-embedded into the soil, and many have "trigger-stones" to support them. The appearance of the site is very similar to that of the [[megalithic]] [[stone circles]] found throughout [[Great Britain|Britain]] (although the function and culture are presumably completely different). Although its association with [[Indigenous Australians]] is well-authenticated and beyond doubt, the purpose is unclear, although it may have a connection with initiation rites. It has also been suggested that the site may have been used for [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy|astronomical]] purposes (Morieson 2003). Other well-known examples in Victoria include the stone arrangements at [[Carisbrook stone arrangement|Carisbrook]] and [[Lake Bolac stone arrangement|Lake Bolac]].&lt;ref&gt;Long, A. &amp; Schell, P., 1999, Lake Bolac stone arrangement (AAV 7422-394); management plan. An unpublished report to Aboriginal Affairs Victoria.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's largest collection of standing stones is said to be at [[Murujuga]], also known as the Burrup peninsula or the Dampier archipelago, in [[Western Australia]], which includes tall standing stones similar to the European [[menhir]]s, as well as circular stone arrangements.

[[Image:Macassan stone arrangement.jpg|thumb|Part of the Yirrkala stone arrangement representing a Macassan fishing boat]]
A very different example is found near [[Yirrkala]] in [[Arnhem Land]], where there are detailed images of the [[prau]]s used by [[Macassan]] fisherman fishing for [[Holothuroidea|Trepang]], several hundred years before European contact. Here the stones are small (typically 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm), sit on the surface of the ground, and can easily be moved by hand, which also implies that they can be easily damaged or altered by modern hands, so that caution is needed when interpreting such sites. Similar examples are found scattered throughout Australia, mainly in remote or inaccessible places, and it is likely that there were many more prior to European settlement of Australia.

In South East Australia are found [[Bora (Australian)|Bora rings]] which consist of two circles of stones, one larger than the other, which were used in an [[initiation ceremony]] and [[rite of passage]] in which boys were transformed into men.

Some Aboriginal stone arrangements in south-east Australia are aligned to [[cardinal directions]] with an accuracy of a few degrees,&lt;ref&gt;Orientations of linear stone arrangements in New South Wales [http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rnorris/papers/n278.pdf Hamacher et al., 2013, Australian Archaeology, 75, 46-54]&lt;/ref&gt;
while the [[Wurdi Youang]] stone arrangement, which indicates the direction of solstitial sunsets, appears to have been built around the east-west direction, again with an accuracy of a few degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Wurdi Youang: An Australian Aboriginal Stone Circle with possible solar indications [http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rnorris/papers/n258.pdf Norris et al., 2013, Rock Art Research, 30, 55-65.]&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement for highly accurate direction is also indicated by the practice of orienting the graves of deceased Kamilaroi men to an accuracy of a few degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Further Notes on the Australian Class Systems [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2842513 A.

[[File:Tate Modern viewed from Thames Pleasure Boat - geograph.org.uk - 307445.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the world's most successful examples of adaptive reuse of old buildings is the conversion of the [[Bankside Power Station]] in London for use as the [[Tate Gallery]]. Formerly off-limits to the general public, it now receives about five million visitors a year.]]
'''Adaptive reuse''' refers to the process of reusing an old site or building for a purpose other than which it was built or designed for. Along with [[brownfield]] reclamation, adaptive reuse is seen by many as a key factor in land conservation and the reduction of [[urban sprawl]]. However adaptive reuse can become controversial as there is sometimes a blurred line between [[renovation]], [[facadism]] and adaptive reuse. It can be regarded as a compromise between [[historic preservation]] and [[demolition]].

==Definition==
Adaptive reuse deals with the issues of conservation and heritage policies. Whilst old buildings become unsuitable for their programmatic requirements, as progress in technology, politics and economics moves faster than the built environment, adaptive reuse comes in as a sustainable option for the reclamation of sites. In many situations, the types of buildings most likely to become subjects of adaptive reuse include: industrial buildings, as cities become [[gentrified]] and the process of manufacture moves away from city; political buildings, such as palaces and buildings which cannot support current and future visitors of the site; and community buildings such as churches or schools where the use has changed over time.

Adaptive reuse is seen as an effective way of reducing urban sprawl and environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim, M. 2002, ''Adaptive reuse'', Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1 Oct. 2011 &lt;http://www.archinode.com/lcaadapt.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  By reusing an existing structure within a site, the energy required to create these spaces is lessened, as is the material waste that comes from destroying old sites and rebuilding using new materials. Through adaptive reuse old, unoccupied buildings can become suitable sites for many different types of use.

==Factors affecting adaptive reuse==

===Criteria for adaptive reuse===
While the process of adaptive reuse is a decision often made purely by companies establishing a particular brand or presence, there are often criteria for deciding whether a building should be conserved and reused or just demolished for the area of land it occupies. Some of these determining criteria include:
* The societal value of a given site; that is, the importance to the community of the use of a site by community members or visitors.
* The potential for the reuse of a particular site; the physical damage sustained to the site and its support of future use, the character of the existing site in terms of the proposed reuse.
* The historical importance of the site; in terms of both the physicality of the street-scape and the area, as well as of the role of the site in the community's understanding of the past.
* The environmental conditions of the site; whether the site is suitable climatically or can support the proposed environmental work needed in the site.

===Economic considerations===
[[File:KelsoHome SE.jpg|thumb|The [[Kelso Home for Girls]] in Baltimore, Maryland was a typical candidate for adaptive reuse, but it was razed to accommodate parking for a new athletic facility when the cost of conversion was found to be too great]]There has been much debate on the economic possibilities and viability of adaptive reuse as different corporations and companies seek to find sustainable ways to approach their corporate or retail sites.&lt;ref&gt;Hyllegard, K., Paff Ogle, J., Dunbar, B. 2003 ‘Sustainability and Historic Preservation in Retail Design: Integrating Design into a Model of the REI Denver Decision-Making Process’ Journal of Interior Design Vol. 29, No.1&amp;2, pp. 32-49&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many outcomes that affect the economic return of adaptive reuse as an avenue to reuse of a given site. Factors such as the reuse of materials and resources as well as a lesser need to involve energy, both in terms of labor and machine powered, can effectively decrease the monetary funds needed for companies to establish sites. However, there can be hidden costs in reusing old buildings such as the unknown contamination of older sites, decay and disuse affecting the usability of a building, and the possible need for modification of an older building to fit current and future [[building codes]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated505"&gt;Shipley, R., Utz, S., Parsons, M. 2006 ‘Does Adaptive reuse Pay? A Study of the Business of Building Renovation in Ontario, Canada’, International Journal of Heritage Studies Vol. 12, No. 6, pp. 505–520&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic costs differ from project to project and some professionals go as far as to assert that new build is always more economical and renovation is universally more expensive,&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, L. 1983 ‘What Developers Think of Historic Preservation’ Urban Land Vol.42, pp. 8 – 11&lt;/ref&gt; due to their own involvement with adaptive reuse projects. Others claim that the return on investment is enhanced when using an older building because of the savings involved. One Canadian developer claims that reusing buildings generally represents a saving of between 10-12%&lt;ref name="autogenerated505"/&gt; over building new. In terms of profitability, there are also assertions that adaptive reuse projects often have an uncertainty to their profitably that newer developments lack. When looking for funding to build, these considerations must be addressed.

With many heritage sites on the agenda for government agencies, there are a number of financial incentives provided in order to increase the use of older sites in many countries.  In the provinces of Canada, some municipalities offer financial encouragement for heritage development such as, the [[City of Waterloo]] who waived the development charges for the [[Seagram]] Lofts that have been estimated to be around $700,000.&lt;ref name="autogenerated505"/&gt; Governing bodies also benefit from the reuse of once abandoned sites as once occupied, they generate tax revenue and therefore often recover the initial investment.

===Advantages of adaptive reuse===
With the debate of adaptive reuse as a sustainable avenue in the development of key sites, there are many advantages to using certain sites for redevelopment. One of these advantages is the site's location. In many cases, historical sites are often located in the centers of large cities. Due to the spatial development of a given area, these buildings can often be [[heritage-listed]] and therefore sold as an entity, rather than just for the land that they occupy, which the new tenants then have to retrofit the building for their particular purpose. Older buildings also often have a specific period character through the detailing and joinery of their constructed eras that newer or reconstructed developments lack. In certain cases such as the hospitality industry, the grand character of a site can influence the feel of their building and are used for maximum potential to enhance the site's physical attractiveness to a client.

===Barriers to adaptive reuse===
As mentioned above, adaptive reuse sometimes isn’t the most viable option for all historic sites. For some sites that have been left alone to decay by neglect, the physical damage of the site can render the site unusable both in terms of the cost to repair the damage as well as unsafe by government standards. Adaptive reuse of sites contaminated by hazardous materials such as asbestos also require special precautions during construction, although these procedures are well-established.  See, for example, http://www.labor.state.ny.us/workerprotection/safetyhealth/sh56.shtm

==By location==

===Americas===

====Canada====
As a comparatively young country, adaptive reuse is not the norm in Canada, where redevelopment has typically meant demolition and building anew. Calgary and Edmonton are particularly known for their pro-demolition culture, but they are not unique in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willferguson.ca/articles/sandstonecity.html Will Ferguson – Sandstone City]. Willferguson.ca (2002-10-07). Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epl.ca/photo-collections?collection=Buildings Photo Collections | Edmonton Public Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702042001/http://www.epl.ca/photo-collections?collection=Buildings |date=2 July 2013 }}. Epl.ca. Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 1990s, adaptive use has gained traction. The conversion of former railway-centred [[warehouse district]]s to residential and commercial uses has occurred in [[Old Canadian National rail yard|Edmonton]], [[Beltline, Calgary|Calgary]], [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|Saskatoon]], [[Regina's historic buildings and precincts|Regina]], and [[Exchange District|Winnipeg]].
[[File:Distillery 3.jpg|thumb|Toronto's Distillery District was a former whiskey distillery]]
In Toronto, the [[Distillery District]], a neighbourhood in the city's southeast side, was entirely adapted from the old [[Gooderham &amp; Worts]] [[distillery]]. Other prominent re-uses include the Candy Factory on Queen Street West and the Toy Factory, in the city's [[Liberty Village]] district, both designed by [[Quadrangle Architects]], a firm specializing in adaptive re-use in Toronto and elsewhere. Vancouver's [[Yaletown]], an upscale neighbourhood established in the 1990s, features warehouses and other small-industrial structures and spaces converted into apartments and offices for the gentrification of the area. Vancouver's [[Granville Island]] also demonstrates a successful mix of adaptive reuse as well as retention of traditional uses in the same district. Montreal's [[Griffintown]], [[Old Port of Montreal|Old Port]], and [[Lachine Canal]] areas all feature ex-industrial areas that have been reused or will do so in the future on current plans.

Other noted adaptive reuse projects in the 2010s have included the [[Laurentian School of Architecture]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], which is incorporating several historic buildings in the city's downtown core into its new campus, similar to the downtown campus of [[NSCAD University]] in Halifax, and Mill Square in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], an ongoing project to convert the derelict [[St. Mary's Paper]] mill into a mixed-use cultural and tourism hub.&lt;ref name=designers&gt;[http://www.northernontariobusiness.com/Regional-News/sault-ste-marie/2014/05/Designers-hired-for-Sault-redevelopment-project.aspx "Designers hired for Sault redevelopment project"]. ''[[Northern Ontario Business]]'', 15 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of former military bases in Canada, declared surplus in the 1990s, have also proven to be opportune for adaptive reuse. An example is the former [[CFB Cornwallis]] in rural Nova Scotia which was largely converted, without demolitions, into a [[business park]].

====United States====
[[File:BaltimorePowerPlant.JPG|thumb|[[Pratt Street Power Plant]] in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, converted into retail, restaurants, and offices.]]
[[File:Western Metal Supply Co..jpg|thumb|right|The Western Metal Building as seen during a game.]]
[[Ghirardelli Square]] in San Francisco was the first major adaptive reuse project in the United States, opening in 1964. Urban waterfronts, historically used as points for industrial production and transport, are now selling-points for home buyers and renters. In American city neighborhoods that have seen racial and ethnic demographic changes over the last century, some houses of worship have been converted for other religions, and some others have been converted into residences.

A large number of brick mill buildings in the Northeast United States have undergone [[mill conversion]] projects. In the United States, especially in the [[Northeast United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwest]], [[loft]] housing is one prominent result of adaptive reuse projects. Formerly-[[industry|industrial]] areas such as the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]] in New York City, [[Callowhill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Callowhill]] in [[Philadelphia]] and [[South of Market, San Francisco|SoMa]] in San Francisco are being transformed into residential neighborhoods through this process. This transformation is sometimes associated with [[gentrification]]. [[Station Square]] in [[Pittsburgh]] [[Pennsylvania]] is an example of a mile-long former [[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad]] terminal and headquarters being converted into a retail, office, hotel, and tourist destination. The [[Pratt Street Power Plant]] in Baltimore was converted to offices, retail, and restaurants. An example of adaptive reuse conversion to office space are [[The Hilliard Mills]]. The adaptive reuse of Empire Stores will transform seven abandoned coffee warehouse in [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]] in New York City into office, retail, restaurant and a rooftop public park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=E99DF405-C29C-7CA2-F6F4E9B623E06B15 |title=Midtown Equities to Redevelop Empire Stores and St. Ann's Warehouse to Develop Tobacco Warehouse at Brooklyn Bridge Park |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=4 September 2013 |website=www.mikebloomberg.com |accessdate=5 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211012140/http://mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=E99DF405-C29C-7CA2-F6F4E9B623E06B15 |archivedate=11 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/nyregion/brooklyn-takes-another-pass-at-revitalizing-an-abandoned-waterfront-warehouse.html?_r=0 |title= Another Pass at Revitalizing Abandoned Warehouse Space on the Waterfront|last1= Dunlap |first1= David |date= 25 September 2013 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other museums adapted from old factories include "MassMOCA",  the [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060206090839/http://www.robertwilson.com/watermill/watermill.htm Watermill Center] in Long Island, New York, and The [[Dia Art Foundation]] Museum in upstate New York.

In [[San Diego, California]], the historic brick structure of the Western Metal Supply Co. building at 7th Avenue (between K and L Streets) was preserved and incorporated into the design of [[Petco Park]], the new [[baseball]]-only ballpark of the [[San Diego Padres]], and can be prominently seen in the left-field corner of that ballpark. It now houses the team's flagship gift shop, luxury rental suites, a restaurant and rooftop bleachers, and its southeast corner serves as the ballpark's left field foul pole.

===Australia===
In Australia, there have been a number of adaptive reuse projects as the main cities have turned from industrial areas into areas of high value and business areas. In Sydney, sites such as the old [[Sydney Mint]] have been renovated and adapted into inner-city headquarters for the [[Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales]]. The movement of the city from an industrial, working class area into a gentrified area with high house prices has helped a number of adaptive reuse sites to exist within such an area, the old [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] building has also been transformed from an old jail into a museum which documents and records the history of Australia's first settlers and convicts.

The industrial history of Australia has also been an influencing factor in determining the types of buildings and areas which have gone on to become adaptive reuse sites, especially in the realms of private residences and community based buildings. Some such sites include, [[Nonda Katsalidis]]’ Malthouse apartments in Richmond, a conversion of a former grain silo and the South Australian site of the Balhannah Mines which was adapted into a private residence and has received awards from the [[Housing Industry Association]] and the Design Institute of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government Department of the Environment and Heritage 2004, "Adaptive reuse – Preserving our past", DEH, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt;

In Adelaide four prominent, heritage listed 19th Century buildings in poor repair were restored, refurbished and given new roles by the South Australian Government during the [[Rann Government]] (2002 to 2011). The [[Torrens Building]] in Victoria Square, former headquarters of the Registrar-General, was restored and adapted to become the Australian campus for both Carnegie Mellon University and University College London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australia.cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon University]&lt;/ref&gt; The former Adelaide Stock Exchange building was purchased, restored and adapted to become the Science Exchange for the Royal Institution Australia and the Australian Science Media Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-14/iconic-buildings-of-adelaide-the-stock-exchange/7508792|title=Iconic buildings of Adelaide: Come inside the Stock Exchange |last=Williamson |first=Brett |publisher=891 ABC Adelaide |date=14 June 2016 |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Torrens Parade Ground and building were restored for use as a headquarters for veterans' organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Cabinet Documents, Department of Premier and Cabinet, July 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly $50 million was committed to restore and adapt the large Glenside Psychiatric Hospital and precinct as the new Adelaide Studios of the South Australian Film Corporation opened by Premier Rann in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safilm.com.au South Australian Film Corporation ]&lt;/ref&gt; And the 62 hectare former Mitsubishi Motors plant is being adapted to become a clean manufacturing centre and education and training hub for Flinders University and TAFE.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Morning Herald,28 May 2011.

In Europe, the main forms of adaptive reuse have been around former palaces and unused residences of the different European royal families into publicly accessible galleries and museums. Many of the spaces have been restored with period finishes and display different collections of art, and design. In Paris, France, the most famous example of adaptive reuse is the [[Musée du Louvre]], a former palace built in the late 12th century under Philip II and opened to the public as a museum in 1793. Also, in London, England, the [[Queen's House]], a former royal residence built around 1614, has become part of the [[National Maritime Museum]] and houses the museum's fine art collection.

The [[Tate Modern]], also in London is another example of adaptive reuse in the European continent, unlike other adaptive reuse galleries in Europe, the Tate Modern takes full advantage of the site of the former [[Bankside Power Station]], which involved the refurbishment of the old, abandoned power station. The wide industrial space has proven to be a worthy backdrop to modern art, with the famous turbine hall hosting artists including [[Olafur Eliasson]], [[Rachel Whiteread]] and [[Ai Weiwei]].

Other famous adaptive reuse sites in Europe include the [[Maastricht]] branch of the [[Selexyz]] chain in the Netherlands. This project received 2007 Lensvelt de Architect interior design award for its innovative reuse and is number one on ''[[The Guardian]]'''s worldwide top ten bookstores list.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson, S. 2008, Top shelves, ''The Guardian'', London, UK viewed 1 October 2011&lt; https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/11/bestukbookshops&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Łódź]], Poland, the [[Izrael Poznański]] mills have been turned into the {{convert|69|ha|adj=on}} [[Manufaktura]] [[mixed-use development]], including a mall, 3 museums, multi-cinema and restaurants.

'''Advance Concrete''' is a [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software application was developed by [[GRAITEC]], but is now an [[Autodesk]] product,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.autodesk.com/press-release/corporate-sustainability/autodesk-signs-agreement-acquire-structural-fabrication-and-d|title=Autodesk Signs Agreement to Acquire Structural Fabrication and Detailing Technology from Graitec|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222090251/http://news.autodesk.com/press-release/corporate-sustainability/autodesk-signs-agreement-acquire-structural-fabrication-and-d|archivedate=2015-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for  [[3D modeling|modeling]] and detailing [[reinforced concrete|reinforced concrete structures]]. Advance Concrete is used in the structural / civil engineering and drafting fields.

==Features==
[[File:AC-structure.png|right|thumb|Building with two floors, with stairs, modeled in Advance Concrete.]]
Advance Concrete is specifically designed for engineers and structural draftsmen looking for comprehensive and easy to use software, including its own graphics engine allowing it to run with or without [[AutoCAD]].

The application can be used for modeling and detailing different types of concrete structures, such as buildings, [[precast concrete]] elements, and also for [[civil engineering]] designs.

Advance Concrete uses AutoCAD technology: [[ObjectARX]]. This technology provides users with professional objects (beams, columns, slabs, bars, frames, stirrup bars) integrated into AutoCAD and on which most basic AutoCAD functions can be applied (stretch, shorten, copy, move). The Advance Concrete native file is the [[.dwg|DWG]] file.

The main functions of Advance Concrete concern:
* 2D / [[3D modeling]] of concrete structures;
* Automated [[Engineering drawing|drawings]], with tools for automatic creation of sections, elevations, foundations, isometric views, etc.;
* Advanced [[reinforcement]], with automatic creation and update functionalities and also with manual input tools;
* Creation of paper drawings;
* Automatic [[bill of materials]].
* Multi-user modeling. Users can securely and simultaneously work on the same project through a shared database that stores the model data.

The program provides a working environment for creating 3D structural models from which drawings are created. The 3D model is created using Advance Concrete specific objects (structural elements, openings, [[rebars]], etc.) and stored in a drawing (in [[.dwg|DWG]] format). Once a model is complete, Advance Concrete creates all structural and reinforcement drawings using a large selection of tools for view creation, dimensions, interactive annotations, symbols, markings and [[automatic layout]] functions. Advance Concrete provides functionalities for automatic drawing updates based on model modifications.

===Specific functionalities===
[[File:AC-ReinfView.png|right|thumb|Reinforcement drawing created in Advance Concrete.]]
One of the features of Advance Concrete is the “dynamic reinforcement” technology for the rapid reinforcement of concrete elements taking into account their context (type, parameters, connection with other elements).
The user creates a so-called dynamic reinforcement solution that integrates the reinforcement cage elements and properties: geometric information, local rules and standards for [[steel grade]], reinforcement bar placement, [[concrete cover]], etc. The reinforcement solutions can be used later for elements that have different sizes. The reinforcement elements adjust to the new dimensions and are taken into account at reinforcement drawing creation and lists.
The user can save the reinforcement solution in an external file, which can be exchanged, downloaded, reused in any other projects etc.

== Software compatibility ==
The application is compatible with the following operating systems and Autodesk platforms: 
* [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows XP]] Pro and [[Windows 7]] (32 and 64 bits)
* AutoCAD 2007, 2008, 2009 32 and 64 bits, 2010 32 and 64 bits 
* ADT 2007,
* AutoCAD Architecture 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011.

== Software interoperability ==
Advance Concrete integrates GRAITEC’s “GTC” (GRAITEC Transfer Center) technology, a [[data synchronization]] technology that allows:
*Importing / exporting data to other GRAITEC software and standard formats ([[Industry Foundation Classes|IFC]] 2.×3)
*Several Advance Concrete users working simultaneously on the same project and synchronizing their models
*Synchronizing in Advance Concrete the modifications made by engineers in other GRAITEC software applications (e.g., section changes, addition of structural elements, etc.).
GTC is the GRAITEC solution for CAD/Design software interoperability and integration specialized in creating and handling a BIM (Building Information Model).

[[Image:Landscape in Sa Pa (Vietnam).jpg|320x320px|thumb|right|An example of advanced anthropization: the cultivation of [[rice]] in [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] in [[Vietnam]]]]

In [[geography]] and [[ecology]], '''anthropization''' is the conversion of open spaces, landscapes, and [[natural environment]]s by human action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypergeo.eu/spip.php?article312|title=Anthropization - Hypergéo|website=www.hypergeo.eu|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropic erosion is the process of human action degrading [[terrain]] and [[soil]].

An area may be classified as anthropized even though it looks natural, such as [[grassland]]s that have been [[Deforestation|deforested]] by humans. It can be difficult to determine how much a site has been anthropized in the case of [[urbanization]] because one must be able to estimate the state of the landscape before significant human action.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Cause ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
The earliest known stages of anthropization can be found as early as the Neolithic era and the basic farmland created in that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypergeo.eu/spip.php?article312|title=Anthropization - Hypergéo|website=www.hypergeo.eu|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
With the continually-growing population of humans, the land that the Earth provides has been appropriated over the years.  The ecological footprint created by anthropization is continually growing despite efficiency and technique improvements made in anthropization..

Whether anthropized or not, all land seldom a few [[Territorial claims in Antarctica|locations]] has been claimed.  Outside of the largely inhospitable [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle|Antarctic]] circles and large portions of other uninhabitable landscapes, much of the globe has been used or altered in some direct way by humans.  Land has been appropriated for many different reasons, but ultimately the outcome is typically a short-term benefit for humans.  An area is anthropized is some way to make land available for housing, to harvest the resources, to create space for some anthropological reason, or many other possibilities.

== Processes and effects ==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Farm in Hainan 01.jpg|thumb|An example of land that has been appropriated for [[Horticulture|cultivation]] in [[Hainan]], [[China]].]]

=== Agriculture ===
The root of many early forms of civilization, [[agriculture]] has been a primary reason for anthropization. To cultivate food or breed animals, humans must alter land—till soil or build structures—to facilitate agriculture.  This can lead to [[soil erosion]] and [[pollution]] ([[pesticide]]s, [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, etc.), and subsequently [[habitat fragmentation]] and overall an increased [[ecological footprint]]. Agriculture and industry often overlap, and industry produces many of these effects too.

=== Urban development ===
Especially with approximately 7.5 Billion humans inhabiting the [[Earth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/|title=World Population Clock: 7.5 Billion People (2017) - Worldometers|website=www.worldometers.info|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; this typically aligns with an increase in residences worldwide.  Over the years, humans have built on land to meet their needs and wants. These actions range from small villages to massive factories, water parks, and apartments.  [[Urbanization]] and development of human residences can significantly affect the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].  Not only does the physical space of buildings fragment habitats and possibly endanger [[Endangered species|species]], but it fundamentally alters the habitat for any other living being.  For some species, this effect can be inconsequential, but for many this can have a dramatic impact.  The biosphere is very much interconnected, and this means that if one organism is affected, then as a result the other organisms within this ecosystem and food chain are also affected.  
[[File:Athabasca oil sands.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Athabasca oil sands|Athabasca]] oil sands are an example of anthropization as a result of the harvest and transport of a non-renewable resource, [[oil sands]].]]
As well, within the last century, any urbanized area requires roads for transportation.  This transportation is a continued source of pollution, and the roads can be a source of soil erosion.

=== Industry and technology ===
To support humans, industrial buildings and processes are apparently essential. Urban development and agriculture require that people produce, refined, or construct many things. Key to this is that factories require that people gather the materials they need to create a product. The wide range of products in this anthropological age use a plethora of substances that must be harvested or produced.  Many of these materials are [[Non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] (e.g., fossil fuel, metal ores, etc.) and the harvest of these results in relatively permanent anthropization. For resources that depend on in high quantity, this can also mean temporary depletion or damage to the source of the resource (e.g., depletion or pollution of fresh water reserves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://puredrinkablewater.weebly.com/how-water-sources-are-being-depleted.html|title=How Water Sources are Being Depleted|website=PureDrinkableWater|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; improper or inefficient [[silviculture]], etc.).  Even sustainable or renewable industrial anthropization still affects the environment.  While the resource in question may not be in jeopardy, the harvest and processing can still change and damage the environment.

==== Science ====
Anthropization can also be a result of scientific endeavours.  This can manifest as construction of structures to aid in scientific discovery and observation.  This can range from structures such as [[Observatory|observatories]], or on the opposite scale the [[Large Hadron Collider]].  These and many other things are built and used to enhance knowledge of sciences. They do however require space and energy.

==== Energy ====
To power the ever-growing human race, energy is needed.  Power-harvesting structures are built to harness energy, such as dams, windmills, and nuclear reactors.  These sources of energy ultimately fuel the rest of anthropological activity and are essential in this way.  However many of these methods have consequences.  With dams, construction aside, they can cause flooding, habitat fragmentation, and other effects.  With nuclear reactors, they have a lasting effect in that typically a lifespan of one of these is around 50 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nuclear-power-plant-aging-reactor-replacement-/|title=How Long Can a Nuclear Reactor Last?|last=Voosen|first=Paul|newspaper=Scientific American|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and afterwards the nuclear waste must be dealt with, and the structure itself must be shut down and cannot be used further.  To safely dispose of this even low-level waste can take hundreds of years, ranging upwards with increased radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. Tyler, David F. Hackett, and Carl Eric Wolfe. ''Living in the Environment''. 4th ed. Toronto: Nelson Education, 2017. 454-55. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  To produce and as a result of this production of energy, it requires a lot of anthropized land.

== Evolution of anthropization ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:All pyramids of Giza panorama 2.jpg|thumb|462x100px|An example of ancient anthropization; Giza pyramid complex, Egypt.]]

Changes in population directly effect anthropological impact—but changes in technology and knowledge have greatly changed anthropization throughout the [[Holocene]]. The tools and methods that humans use to anthropize have changed drastically.  For examples, the great [[pyramid]]s in [[Egypt]] were not constructed by some large machine, but instead by thousands of humans.  They were still able to build massive monuments, but the efficiency of their efforts and environmental damage is much different than today.  This shows that the environmental effect of modern anthropization is generally greater, not just because of the increase in population. Pollution and loss of [[biodiversity]] in Egypt was largely natural, not man-made, and anthropization existed on a much lower level.

As the human population of Earth increase, this anthropization will continue to evolve.

It is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/ai/metrics|title=AI Progress Measurement|date=2017-06-12|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/popular-datasets-over-time/code|title=Popular Datasets Over Time {{!}} Kaggle|website=www.kaggle.com|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.&lt;ref name="HopeResheff2017"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hope|first1=Tom|last2=Resheff|first2=Yehezkel S.|last3=Lieder|first3=Itay|title=Learning TensorFlow: A Guide to Building Deep Learning Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sUowDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64|accessdate=22 January 2018|date=2017-08-09|publisher="O'Reilly Media, Inc."|isbn=9781491978481|pages=64–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class.&lt;ref name="AngelovGegov2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Angelov|first1=Plamen|last2=Gegov|first2=Alexander|last3=Jayne|first3=Chrisina|first4=Qiang|last4=Shen|title=Advances in Computational Intelligence Systems: Contributions Presented at the 16th UK Workshop on Computational Intelligence, September 7–9, 2016, Lancaster, UK|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnD_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA441|accessdate=22 January 2018|date=2016-09-06|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319465623|pages=441–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer algorithms for recognizing objects in photos often learn by example. CIFAR-10 is a set of images that can be used to teach a computer how to recognize objects. Since the images in CIFAR-10 are low-resolution (32x32), this dataset can allow researchers to quickly try different algorithms to see what works. Various kinds of [[convolutional neural network]]s tend to be the best at recognizing the images in CIFAR-10.

CIFAR-10 is a labeled subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset. When the dataset was created, students were paid to label all of the images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf|title=Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images|last=Krizhevsky|first=Alex|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Papers Claiming State-of-the-Art Results on CIFAR-10 ==

This is a table of some of the research papers that claim to have achieved state-of-the-art results on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Not all papers are standardized on the same pre-processing techniques, like image flipping or image shifting. For that reason, it is possible that one paper's claim of state-of-the-art could have a higher error rate than an older state-of-the-art claim but still be valid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">A '''China watcher''', or, less frequently, '''Pekingologist''', is a person who reports on the [[politics of the People's Republic of China]] for [[Western world|western]] consumption, especially in a [[Cold War]] context. "China watching" was coined by analogy to [[birdwatching]], which takes place from a distance. It represents a semantic break from the earlier term [[China Hands]], which referred to knowledgeable businesspeople who made political commentary from inside mainland China: after the [[Chinese Revolution of 1949]], China watchers more frequently had backgrounds in academia, rather than business, and operated out of consulates in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="Safire"&gt;{{cite book|title=Safire's Political Dictionary|first=William|last=Safire|authorlink=William Safire|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|pages=118-119|chapter=China watchers}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"China watcher" can be distinguished from [[Sinologist]], which can loosely refer to anyone who studies China, but, especially in the United States, more frequently refers to those who study classical language, literature, or civilization.&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; In other languages, where the term ''Pekingologist'' does not exist, the usage of these terms are less rigidly delineated. In French for instance, the term ''sinologue'' would refer to both a researcher in Sinology and a reporter of Pekingology.

==History and nature of China watching==
During the [[Cold War]], China watchers centered in [[Hong Kong]] and many of them simultaneously worked for Western [[intelligence agencies]], universities, and news organizations. Much of their reporting would be previewed by the British colonial government's [[Government Secretariat (Hong Kong)|secretariat]], to prepare for diplomatic consequences. Of the various nationalities of China watcher, the Americans were the most prolific, due to the activity of the [[Consulate General of the United States, Hong Kong and Macau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gittings|1972|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual distrust between the United States and China and the prohibition of travel between the countries meant that American China watchers did not have access to press briefings or interviews. Therefore, China watchers adopted techniques from [[Kremlinology]], such as the close parsing of official announcements for hidden meanings, movements of officials reported in newspapers, and analysis of photographs of public appearances.&lt;ref&gt; Gail Solin, "The Art of China Watching" [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol19no1/html/v19i1a04p_0001.htm#top Center for the Study of Intelligence &gt; Studies Archive ]&lt;/ref&gt; China watchers would also interview refugees from mainland China, or reprint analysis from Taiwan or the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gittings|1972|pp=415, 421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent China watchers in Hong Kong in the first decades after the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Communist revolution of 1949]] included [[László Ladány]] and [[Pierre Ryckmans (writer)|Pierre Ryckmans]]. Publications by the Consulate-General, which were frequently cited by China-watchers (some of whom did not speak Chinese) included ''Survey of the China Mainland Press'', ''Current Background'', and ''Selections from Mainland China Magazines''. These publications emphasized problems and contradictions in national policy, violence, and atrocity, ignoring topics like education or culture unless there was an associated controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gittings|1972|pp=420}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years since the [[reform and opening up]], China watchers can live in China and take advantage of normal sources of information. Others remained in Hong Kong, however. The Hong Kong journalist [[Willy Lam|Willy Wo-Lap Lam]] has been called the "quintessential China watcher, practiced in the art of Pekingology," whose "scope is wide, but the focus of his analysis is the [[Zhongnanhai]] and factional manoeuvring among the political elite."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Shambaugh]], China Quarterly 142 (June 1995): 608.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conservation and restoration of neon objects''' is the process of caring for and maintaining neon objects (artworks), and includes documentation, examination, research, and treatment to insure their long-term viability, when desired.

==Neon Technology==
[[Georges Claude]], a French engineer, developed neon technology in 1910.  Claude introduced neon technology in [[Paris]], and it later became popular in America during the 1920s for use in advertising signage. Its popularity rose until the 1940s, after which neon signage was used less due to the invention of inexpensive plastics.

Neon lights are low-pressure gas discharge bulbs. They produce light by charging [[noble gases]] in glass cathode tubes with electricity.

===Tubes===
Neon bulbs are composed of noble gases sealed in glass tubing. The tubing can be bent by a professional glass blower or neon vendor into a variety of shapes to produce different imagery or text. The tube is vacuum-pumped to remove all air, after which a small amount of selected gases are pumped into the tube prior to permanently sealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stern |first=Rudi |date=1979 |title=Let There Be Neon |url=https://www.amazon.com/Let-there-neon-Rudi-Stern/dp/0810912554 |location=New York |publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers |page=132 |isbn=0-8109-1255-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each end of the tube is fitted with metal terminals called electrodes, also as known as cathodes.  When the electrodes are connected an energy source, the tube will glow as the gas becomes electrically excited. Different gases produce different colors; in addition, the glass tubing can also be coated or tinted, and different tubing and gas combinations produce a range of 150 colors.

===Gases===
Noble gases are sealed inside airtight cathode tubes, and produce light when they are electrically excited. Different gases and gas combinations will produce different colors, and are used in varying degrees in neon lights:

==Neon in fine art==
Prior to the 1960s, neon technology was associated with advertising and was not considered fine art. In the 1960s, visual artists began experimenting with neon in mixed media and installation artworks. Prominent neon artworks during this time include [[Jasper Johns]]’ ''Field Painting'' (c. 1963-1964), [[James Rosenquist|James Rosenquist’s]] ''Tumbleweed'' (1963-1966), and [[Robert Rauschenberg|Robert Rauschenberg’s]] ''Green Shirt'' (1965-1967).

Chryssa, a Greek artist, is largely credited with establishing neon as a visual art form. She was very active in the 1960s and 70s and created large-scale works with a focus on and constant incorporation of neon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/arts/chryssa-artist-who-saw-neons-potential-as-a-medium-dies-at-79.html |title=Chryssa, Artist Who Saw Neon’s Potential as a Medium, Dies at 79|last=Fox|first=Margalit|publisher=Arts |date=18 January 2014 |website=The New York Times|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists began exploring the neon technology in 1970s, and have continued to do so in contemporary art making.

Some artists both design and create neon artworks by learning the skill set; however, the majority of artists rely on professional neon vendors to fabricate artworks following the artists’ design.

Neon artworks can be found in many permanent public collections, including the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], Chicago, IL, and the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], Washington, D.C. In 1981, [[Lili Lakich]] and Richard Jenkins founded the [[Museum of Neon Art]] (MONA) in Los Angeles, whose collection preserves and exhibits historical neon advertisements and neon fine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-neon-downtown25-2009sep25-story.html |title=L.A.'s Museum of Neon Art is Glowing, Glowing, Gone|last=DiMassa|first=Cara Mia|date=25 September 2009 |website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the museum closed its Los Angeles location, and reopened in November, 2015, in [[Glendale, California]].

==Collection care and maintenance of neon artworks==

===Unpacking===
Unpacking a neon artwork slowly and carefully will help avoid damage. As the glass tubes are fragile, they may become damaged during shipping. Preparing a condition report of the work after receipt will document if any of the tubes or components were cracked or broken during transit, and can be addressed prior to display. Unpacking artworks in teams of at least two people will better allow safer handling of the work, and may aid in documentation and recording.

===Cleaning===
Over time, neon artworks may collect dust. To ensure safety of personnel and the artwork, neon artworks should be turned off and unplugged prior to any cleaning. Trained professionals may undertake cleaning the work with approved materials such as a feather duster or dry paintbrush. The use of water or other cleaning liquids may pose a safety hazard due to potential contact with the electrical components. A professional conservator, specialist, or electrician should be consulted whenever:

*Any component of the artwork requires more than a light dusting.
*Part or all of the neon tubes are flickering/failing to illuminate.
* There is any rusting of the metal support structures. 
*The piece incurs any damage.

===Electrical safety===
'''Outlets:''' Neon artworks require electricity in order to function. A building electrical engineer should always be consulted prior to installing and displaying a neon artwork to confirm safe use of an electrical outlet. An outlet should never be overloaded. If an outlet feels warm, an electrician should be consulted before further use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nfpa.org/safety-information/for-consumers/causes/electrical/electrical-safety-in-the-home/electrical-safety-tips|title=Electrical Safety Tips |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=National Fire Prevention Association |access-date=2 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cords:''' Electrical cords connecting a neon artwork to a power source should be checked on a regular basis for any signs of fraying or wear and tear. The placement of cords is also important. If cords are run in high traffic areas, they may pose a tripping hazard to visitors, which could potentially result in personal injury and damage to the cord and/or artwork. The placement of cords in and against walls and out of traffic areas provide better safety and use. Use of [[extension cords]] are not recommended, as they increase the risk of potential electrical and tripping hazards. Review of the artwork and its installation, including outlet and cord placement,by curatorial, installation, and electrical staff will help ensure the safety of the artwork.

'''Transformers:''' A transformer  is used to convert electricity into use by the neon sign. Transformers last approximate ten to fifteen years, and older transformers may fail or pose safety risks, and require replacement. Failure to replace an older transformer may result in flickering in the neon artwork, or complete failure to light. It is important to consult an electrical engineer or professional to confirm the voltage type and requirements for the replacement transformer. When cataloging a neon artwork, the transformer type and age may be noted in the artwork record, along with a reminder about potential future transformer replacements.

Like other media, neon artworks should be monitored and condition reports performed on a regular basis. If an artwork appears to flicker or fails to illuminate, the work can first be assessed on display. Potential problems may include damage to the tubes, disruptions to the electrical components, including frayed wires or unplugged cords, or potential disruptions of the electrical supply (such as a power outage in the building or circuit). Prior to removing from display, the work should be turned off and disconnected from the electrical source. Flickering may indicate a problem with gas pressures inside the tubes (possibly a result of age and/or damaged tubes) or a failing transformer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/25-signs.htm|title=The Preservation of Historic Signs|last=Auer |first=Michael J. |date=October 1991| publisher=Preservation Briefs|website=National Park Service|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handling damaged neon===
Cracked or damaged neon tubes present potential health risks from contact with broken glass and exposure to mercury, a heavy metal contaminant, in gas form.  Though any mercury vapor, if present, will be in small amounts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMERC Fact Sheet Mercury Use in Lighting|url=http://www.newmoa.org/prevention/mercury/imerc/factsheets/lighting.cfm |date=2008|website=Interstate Mercury Education &amp; Reduction Clearinghouse|publisher=Northeast Management Waste Officials' Association|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; steps should still be taken to avoid contamination. If a neon tube appears damaged, it should not be handled. If handling is required for removal, barrier gloves, such as nitrile, and protective covering, such an apron or smock, will help avoid potential contamination to personnel. Broken tubes should be stored separately from other collection items to avoid contamination, and clearly labeled with hazard labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Contaminated Museum Collections|url=https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/migrated/museum/upload/Contaminated_Collections_FAQs.pdf|date=2006 |website=Interior Museum|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broken tubes will require assessment from a professional conservator/neon specialist.

==Re-fabrication==
Neon technology is non-archival. The gases have limited lifespans, and older electrical components will degrade over time. This may result in a limited display capacity for a neon work, e.g. diminished or intermittent light, or a complete loss of function, as well as pose safety risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winslow|first1=Margaret|title=Conservation of Rafael Ferrer's Neon Corner|url=http://blog.artbma.org/2014/11/http://www.delart.org/conservation-of-rafael-ferrers-neon-corner/|publisher=Delaware Art Museum|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other traditional art mediums, such as painting, conservation for neon artworks and other new materials does not necessarily focus on preserving and repairing the original materials. As neon is a newer technology and media, there is less data available about how the media changes over time and how to inhibit further degradation. In order to successfully conserve a contemporary artwork such as neon, the conservator must 
* identify the materials and understand are they were applied and function.
*collect detailed information about their alteration overt time.
*preserve the artist's intent, which must therefore be documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chiantore|first1=Oscar|last2=Rava |first2=Antonio|date=2012 |title=Conserving Contemporary Art: Issues, Methods, Materials, and Research |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|page=16 |isbn=978-1-60606-104-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the media or technology cannot be safely recovered or addressed, new and replacement technology may be used to return the artwork closest to the state originally envisioned by the artist. This refabrication may be undertaken by a conservator, or potentially by the artist himself/herself. This may include replacing the neon tubes, electrical components such as cords and transformers, the work's support structure, or other media included in the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hileman|first1=Kristen|title=BMA Voices: Re-fabricating a beloved sculpture|url=http://blog.artbma.org/2014/11/bma-voices-re-fabricating-a-beloved-sculpture/|website=BMA Blog|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of refabrication is the conservation of [[Rockne Krebs]]' ''Miami Line''. In 1984, the Miami-Dade County's Art in Public Places program commissioned Krebs to create a public artwork for the Metrorail bridge. The resulting work, ''Miami Line'', consisted of a rainbow of neon lights spanning the 1,540 bridge. Over time, the vibrations caused by trains on the bridge caused the neon lights to burn out, and by 2013, the entire work was no longer illuminated. The Art in Public Places program worked with the artist's estate to develop a plan to recreate the work using LED lights, which would be resistant to train vibrations, but still maintain the visual effect created by the artist. Electrical assessments and conservation of the work began in 2014, and the work will be relit upon completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art in Public Places Annual Report 2014|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/mayor/library/memos-and-reports/2015/04/04.22.15-Art-in-Public-Places-Annual-Report-FY-2014.pdf|publisher=Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs|page=10|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of a potentially burnt out neon tube, a conservator may identify the burned out tube portion of a neon artwork through use of a neon light tester, also known as a [[test light]] or voltage tester. This electronic test device is used to determine whether an electric current is running through the equipment being tested.

==Replication==
Replication differs from Re-fabrication in that the original artwork is not altered, and instead a copy is produced for temporary exhibition purposes. While the replica may not contain the same materials used in the original artwork, the finished product is approximately identical of the original.

Replication can only be undertaken with the approval of the artist or the artist’s estate. Bruce Nauman is an artist who requires four criteria be met to replicate his original neon artworks. These criteria are:
# The original neon must still be in existence and in working order.
# The current owner must agree to loan the work prior to the creation of a replica.
# The display credit line for the loaned artwork acknowledges the work on view is an exhibition copy and acknowledges the owner of the original artwork.
# The replica will be destroyed at the completion of the exhibition, which must be proven through photographic documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Conservation of Bruce Nauman's Neon Templates|url=http://theglasshouse.org/learn/the-conservation-of-bruce-naumans-neon-templates/|website=The Glass House |publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kist off merrivale row-4.jpg|thumb|left|Kistvaen to the south of the [[Merrivale, Devon|Merrivale]] [[stone row]]s]]

==Description==
The word "kistvaen" is derived from the Cornu-Celtic ''Cist-veyn'' or ''Cist-vyin''; in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the word is ''Cist-faen''. All these names mean "a stone chest" (''cist'' is a chest or box, ''maen'' is a stone). Kistvaens are formed using four or more flat stones for the sides and for the ends, and a larger flat stone (the "capstone") for the cover. Some kistvaens are surrounded by circles of erected stones. In general, if a body was to be buried without cremation, it was placed into a kistvaen in a [http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/images/Kistvaen3.gif contracted position]. If on the other hand a body was [[cremate]]d, the [[wood ash|ash]]es were usually put in a [[cinerary urn]], and then the urn was placed in a kistvaen.

However, the majority of the known Dartmoor kistvaens were opened at some time in the past, and whatever they used to hold is missing. The cists were probably robbed in the hope of finding [[treasure]]. Kistvaens were known by many [[common name]]s, including "money pits", "money boxes", "crocks of gold", "caves", "Roman graves" and so on. The idea that ancient tombs might contain valuable items is a very old one; one of the first mentions of searching [[tumuli]] in Devon dates back to 1324. Permission to search was granted by [[Edward II of England]].&lt;ref name="The Reliquary &amp; illustrated archæologist"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZQSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA161| last =Allen| first = John Romilly |author2=[[John Charles Cox]]| title =DARTMOOR KISTVAENS| work =| publisher =London, Bermose and sons Limited| date =January 1895| accessdate = 2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently archaeologists usually use the word [[cist]] when talking about kistvaens, but in the past 120+ years other terms have been used, including "chest", "maen" or "vaen", "a stone" "a stone coffin" and so on.&lt;ref name="The tomb raiders"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/tomb_raider.htm|title=The tomb raiders|accessdate=2009-05-31|publisher=legendarydartmoor.co.uk|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
Tombs of the dead were traditionally regarded as sacred places by the people of Dartmoor. However the various treasure-related common names for these burial sites caused some people to break the [[taboo]] that tombs must be revered and not disturbed. As a result of this tomb-raiding, stories came into being which purport to show that a graverobber's inappropriate and greedy actions will be punished in supernatural ways.

One of the legends is about "the [[parson]]", although this may possibly have been someone's [[nickname]] rather than the title of a real man of the cloth. Either way, the story says he made a map of all of the nearby kistvaens, showing the locations as black dots. Very soon his map had more black dots than a [[Psyllobora vigintiduopunctata|ladybird]] has on its back. The lure of the kistvaens was so great that the parson (and a few other people who agreed to help him) opened every kistvaen that was marked on his map.

After this, the parson was seen counting money every night. His wealth did not make him happy, and neither did it last long. One night a huge electrical storm moved over the [[moorland|moor]]s. Furious [[lightning]] was followed again and again almost immediately by very loud [[thunder]]. Nobody could sleep for the noise of the storm.

Surprisingly the next morning there was very little damage to be seen. Actually all the houses around were intact, except for one house&amp;nbsp;— the house of the parson. His house was in ruins, and it was still burning. Some neighbors even thought they smelled burning [[Fire and brimstone|brimstone]]. Presumably the [[devil]] himself had made the parson pay for desecrating the kistvaens.&lt;ref name="The tomb raiders"/&gt;

===The Money Pit kistvaen story===
This story features a very friendly, good-natured farmer. Once he had a dream about a kistvaen close to his farm. In his dream he saw that the kistvaen was filled with money. Next day he went there, and with a huge effort he managed to move the capstone, and started to dig.

As he dug, a huge [[raven]] circled overhead, mocking him, and encouraging him to dig deeper and deeper. Eventually the farmer put his hand inside, and pulled out a small piece of [[flint]], shaped in the form of a heart. He took his find home. After this incident, his personality changed radically: he became mean and angry, and he lost all his friends. His life became miserable. About a year later, his young son found the flint in the house, and took it outside to play with it. Then the boy went out onto the moor to look for something else to play with, and he dropped the flint as he went along.

On that same day the farmer changed once again, reverting to the "jolly farmer" he had always been until the unfortunate day when he opened the kistvaen.&lt;ref name="The Money Pit"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/money_pit.htm|title=The Money Pit|accessdate=2009-05-31|publisher=legendarydartmoor.co.uk|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hot metalwork.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Heat]], a form of energy, is partly [[potential energy]] and partly [[kinetic energy]]]]

'''Energy quality''' is the contrast between different [[Energy forms|forms of energy]], the different [[trophic level]]s in [[ecology|ecological]] systems and the propensity of [[energy]] to convert from one form to another. The concept refers to the empirical experience of the characteristics, or [[qualia]], of different energy forms as they [[Energy flow (ecology)|flow]] and transform. It appeals to our common [[perception]] of the [[heat]] value, versatility, and environmental performance of different energy forms and the way a small increment in energy flow can sometimes produce a large transformation effect on both energy [[physical state]] and energy. For example the transition from a [[solid]] state to [[liquid]] may only involve a very small addition of energy. Methods of evaluating energy quality are sometimes concerned with developing a system of ranking energy qualities in [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] order.

==Introduction==
Since before [[ancient history|antiquity]] there has been deep [[philosophical]], [[aesthetic]] and scientific interest in the contrast of quality with [[quantity]]. In some respects the history of [[Modernism|modern]] and [[postmodern]] thought can be characterized by the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] approach to these two concepts. A central question has been whether the many different qualitative aspects of the world can be understood in terms of rational quantities, or whether the qualitative and quantitative are irreconcilable: that is, there is no "rational quality", or [[quale]] ratio. Many scientists and analytic philosophers say they are not, and therefore consider some qualitative phenomena like, for instance, [[spirituality]], and [[astrology]] to be unquantifiable, unanalysable by [[scientific methods]], and therefore ungrounded in physical reality. The notion of energy quality therefore has a tendency to be linked with phenomena many scientists consider unquantifiable, or at least incommunicable, and are consequently dismissed out of hand.

At the same time many people have also recognised qualitative differences in the way things can be done by different entities (both physical and biological). Humans, for example have qualitatively different capacities than many other mammals, due, in part, to their [[opposable thumb]]. In the attempt to formalise some of the qualitative differences, entities were grouped according to distinguishing features or capacities. Different schools of thought used different methods to make distinctions. Some people chose [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] and [[genome]] [[structure]], while others chose [[energetics|energetic]] function as the basis of classifications. The former are often associated with biology, while the latter with the trophic food chain analysis of ecology. These can be considered attempts to formalise quantitative, scientific studies of the qualitative differences between entities. The efforts were not isolated to biology and ecology, since engineers were also interested in quantifying the amount of work that qualitatively different sources of energy could provide.

==Ohta==

According to Ohta (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;90–91) the ranking and scientific analysis of energy quality was first proposed in 1851 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] under the concept of "availability". This concept was continued in Germany by Z. Rant, who developed it under the title, "die Exergie" (the [[exergy]]). It was later continued and standardised in [[Japan]]. [[Exergy]] analysis now forms a common part of many industrial and ecological energy analyses. For example, I.Dincer and Y.A. Cengel (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;132) state that energy forms of different qualities are now commonly dealt with in [[steam power]] [[engineering]] industry. Here the "quality index" is the relation of exergy to the energy content (Ibid.). However energy engineers were aware that the notion of heat quality involved the notion of [[Value theory|value]] – for example A. Thumann wrote, "The essential quality of heat is not the amount but rather its 'value'" (1984, p.&amp;nbsp;113) – which brings into play the question of [[teleology]] and wider, or ecological-scale goal functions. In an ecological context S.E. Jorgensen and G.Bendoricchio say that exergy is used as a goal function in ecological models, and expresses energy "with a built-in measure of quality like energy" (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;392).

==Energy quality evaluation methods==
There appear to be two main kinds of methodology used for the calculation of energy quality. These can be classed as either receiver or donor methods. One of the main differences that distinguishes these classes is the assumption of whether energy quality can be upgraded in an energy transformation process.

'''Receiver methods:''' view energy quality as a measure and indicator of the relative ease with which energy converts from one form to another. That is, how much energy is received from a transformation or transfer process. For example, A. Grubler [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Transition_in_Energy_Use/transitions-euse-ene_encyclop_2004.pdf] used two types of indicators of energetic quality ''pars pro toto'': the hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratio, and its inverse, the [[carbon intensity]] of energy. Grubler used the latter as an indicator of relative environmental quality. However Ohta says that in multistage industrial conversion systems, such as a [[hydrogen production]] system using solar energy, the energy quality is not upgraded (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;125).

'''Donor methods:''' view energy quality as a measure of the amount of energy used in an energy transformation, and that goes into sustaining a product or service (H.T.Odum 1975, p.&amp;nbsp;3). That is how much energy is donated to an energy transformation process. These methods are used in ecological physical chemistry, and ecosystem evaluation. From this view, in contrast with that outlined by Ohta, energy quality ''is'' upgraded in the multistage trophic conversions of ecological systems. Here, upgraded energy quality has a greater capacity to feedback and control lower grades of energy quality. Donor methods attempt to understand the ''usefulness'' of an energetic process by quantifying the extent to which higher quality energy controls lower quality energy.

==Energy quality in physical-chemical science (direct energy transformations) ==
===Constant energy form but variable energy flow===
T.Ohta suggested that the concept of energy quality may be more intuitive if one considers examples where the [[Energy#Forms of energy|form of energy]] remains constant but the amount of energy flowing, or transferred is varied. For instance if we consider only the inertial form of  energy, then the energy quality of a moving body is higher when it moves with a greater velocity. If we consider only the heat form of energy, then a higher temperature has higher quality. And if we consider only the light form of energy then light with higher frequency has greater quality (Ohta 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;90). All these differences in energy quality are therefore easily measured with the appropriate scientific instrument.

===Variable energy form, but constant energy flow===
The situation becomes more complex when the form of energy does not remain constant. In this context Ohta formulated the question of energy quality in terms of the conversion of energy of one form into another, that is the '''transformation''' of energy. Here, energy quality is defined by the '''relative ease''' with which the energy transforms, from form to form.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If energy A is relatively easier to convert to energy B but energy B is relatively harder to convert to energy A, then the quality of energy A is defined as being higher than that of B. The ranking of energy quality is also defined in a similar way. (T.Ohta 1994, p. 90).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Nomenclature:''' Prior to Ohta's definition above, A.W.Culp produced an energy conversion table describing the different conversions from one energy to another. Culp's treatment made use of a subscript to indicate which energy form is being talked about. Therefore, instead of writing "energy A", like Ohta above, Culp referred to "J&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;", to specify electrical form of energy, where" J" refers to "energy", and the "''e''"subscript refers to electrical form of energy. Culps notation anticipated Scienceman's (1997) later maxim that all energy should be specified as form energy with the appropriate subscript.

==Energy quality in biophysical economics (indirect energy transformations)==
The notion of energy quality was also recognised in the economic sciences. In the context of [[biophysical economics]] energy quality was measured by the amount of economic output generated per unit of energy input (C.J. Cleveland et al. 2000). The estimation of energy quality in an economic context is also associated with [[embodied energy]] methodologies. Another example of the economic relevance of the energy quality concept is given by Brian Fleay. Fleay says that the "Energy Profit Ratio (EPR) is one measure of energy quality and a pivotal index for assessing the economic performance of fuels. Both the direct and indirect energy inputs embodied in goods and services must be included in the denominator." (2006; p.&amp;nbsp;10) Fley calculates the EPR as the energy output/energy input.

==Ranking energy quality==
===Energy abundance and relative transformation ease as measure of hierarchical rank and/or hierarchical position===

Ohta sought to order energy form conversions according to their quality and introduced a hierarchical scale for ranking energy quality based on the relative ease of energy conversion (see table to right after Ohta, p.&amp;nbsp;90). It is evident that Ohta did not analyse all forms of energy. For example, water is left out of his evaluation. It is important to note that the ranking of energy quality is not determined solely with reference to the efficiency of the energy conversion. This is to say that the evaluation of "relative ease" of an energy conversion is only partly dependent on transformation efficiency. As Ohta wrote, "the turbine generator and the electric motor have nearly the same efficiency, therefore we cannot say which has the higher quality" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;90). Ohta therefore also included, 'abundance in nature' as another criterion for the determination energy quality rank. For example, Ohta said that, "the only electrical energy which exists in natural circumstances is lightning, while many mechanical energies exist." (Ibid.). (See also table 1. in [http://www.exergy.se/ftp/japan85.pdf Wall's article] for another example ranking of energy quality).

===Transformity as an energy measure of hierarchical rank===

Like Ohta, H.T.Odum also sought to order energy form conversions according to their quality, however his hierarchical scale for ranking was based on extending ecological system food chain concepts to thermodyanmics rather than simply relative ease of transformation . For H.T.Odum energy quality rank is based on the amount of energy of one form required to generate a unit of another energy form. The ratio of one energy form input to a different energy form output was what H.T.Odum and colleagues called [[transformity]]: "the [[Emergy|EMERGY]] per unit energy in units of emjoules per joule" (H.T.Odum 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;1135).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2836">'''Evolutionary suicide''' is an evolutionary phenomenon in which the process of [[adaptation]] causes the population to become [[extinct]]. For example, individuals might be selected to switch from eating mature plants to seedlings, and thereby deplete their food plant's population. Selection on individuals can theoretically produce adaptations that threaten the survival of the population.

Much of the research on evolutionary suicide has used the [[mathematical model]]ing technique [[adaptive dynamics]], in which genetic changes are studied together with [[population dynamics]]. This allows the model to predict how [[population density]] will change as a given [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] invades the population.

Evolutionary suicide has also been referred to as "Darwinian extinction", "runaway selection to self-extinction", and "evolutionary collapse".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The idea is similar in concept to the [[tragedy of the commons]] and the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall]], namely that they are all examples of an accumulation of individual changes leading to a collective disaster such that it negates those individual changes.

Many adaptations have apparently negative effects on population dynamics, for example infanticide by male lions, or the production of toxins by bacteria. However, empirically establishing that an extinction event was unambiguously caused by the process of adaptation is not a trivial task.

[[File:BridgeExpansionJoint.jpg|thumb|Expansion joint on a bridge]]
An '''expansion joint''' or '''movement joint''' is an assembly designed to safely absorb the [[Thermal expansion|temperature-induced expansion]] and contraction of construction materials, to absorb vibration, to hold parts together, or to allow movement due to ground settlement or earthquakes. They are commonly found between sections of [[building]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[sidewalk]]s, [[railway track]]s, piping systems, ships, and other structures.

Building faces, concrete slabs, and pipelines expand and contract due to warming and cooling from seasonal variation, or due to other heat sources. Before expansion joint gaps were built into these structures, they would crack under the stress induced.

==Bridge expansion joints==
Bridge expansion joints are designed to allow for continuous traffic between structures while accommodating movement, shrinkage, and temperature variations on reinforced and prestressed concrete, composite, and steel structures.  They stop the bridge from bending out of place in extreme conditions, and also allow enough vertical movement to permit bearing replacement &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freyssinet.co.uk/pdfs/PS_07%20Bearings.pdf Freyssinet: Bearing Replacement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426065912/http://www.freyssinet.co.uk/pdfs/PS_07%20Bearings.pdf |date=2012-04-26 }}, Freyssinet Ltd. (retrieved 22 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; without the need to dismantle the bridge expansion joint. There are various types, which can accommodate movement from {{convert|30|to|1000|mm}}. They include joints for small movement (EMSEAL BEJS, XJS, JEP, WR, WOSd, and Granor AC-AR), medium movement (ETIC EJ, Wd), and large movement (WP, ETIC EJF/Granor SFEJ).

Modular expansion joints are used when the movements of a bridge exceed the capacity of a single gap joint or a finger type joint. A watertight system, invented by the Swiss company Mageba, is designed on a modular basis and can be tailored to satisfy the specific requirements of almost any structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freyssinet.co.uk/pdfs/products/cipec_expansion_joints_(cv1).pdf Freyssinet: CIPEC Bridge Expansion Joints], Freyssinet Ltd. (retrieved 21 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emseal.com/Products/Infrastructure/BridgeJointSeals/BEJSBridgeJointSystem.htm EMSEAL: BEJS Expansion Joint System, EMSEAL Joint Systems.] (retrieved 8 August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usluk.com/bridgecare/products/bridge-expansion-joints/britflex-bej/ Britflex BEJ Expansion Joint, Universal Sealants UK Ltd.] (retrieved 27 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Modular multiple-gap expansion joints can accommodate movements in every direction and rotations about every axis. They can be used for longitudinal movements of as little as 160&amp;nbsp;mm, or for very large movements of well over 3000&amp;nbsp;mm. The total movement of the bridge deck is divided among a number of individual gaps which are created by horizontal surface beams. The individual gaps are sealed by watertight elastomeric profiles, and surface beam movements are regulated by an elastic control system. The drainage of the joint is via the drainage system of the bridge deck. Certain joints feature so-called “sinus plates” on their surface, which reduce noise from over-passing traffic by up to 80%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mageba-group.com/en/794/Infrastructure/Expansion-joints/Longitudinal-movements-of-over-1-000-mm/TENSA-MODULAR-LR-LR-LS/Detail.htm Modular expansion joint]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Masonry ==
Clay bricks expand as they absorb heat and moisture. This places compression stress on the bricks and mortar, encouraging bulging or flaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gobrick.com/portals/25/docs/technical%20notes/tn18a.pdf|title=TECHNICAL NOTES on Brick Construction TN 18A Accommodating Expansion of Brickwork|last=|first=|date=|website=Brick Industry Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint replacing mortar with elastomeric sealant will absorb the compressive forces without damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masonryconstruction.com/how-to/difference-between-control-and-expansion-joints_o|title=Difference Between Control and Expansion Joints|last=|first=|date=|website=www.masonryconstruction.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825060157/http://www.masonryconstruction.com/how-to/difference-between-control-and-expansion-joints_o|archive-date=2016-08-25|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete decking (most typically in [[sidewalk]]s) can suffer similar horizontal issues, which is usually relieved by adding a wooden spacer between the slabs. The wooden expansion joint compresses as the concrete expands. Dry, rot-resistant ceder is typically used, with a row of nails sticking out that will embed into the concrete and hold the spacer in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldnet.com/life/fix-those-rotted-wood-concrete-patio-dividers/|title=Fix those rotted, wood concrete patio dividers {{!}} HeraldNet.com|date=2009-09-09|work=HeraldNet.com|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{Anchor|Control joints}}Comparison to control joints===
[[File:Saw Cut Control Joint in Concrete.jpg|right|thumb|Saw cut control joints in concrete]]
Control joints, or contraction joints, are sometimes confused with expansion joints, but are completely different in purpose and function. Control joints are cut into  pavement at regular intervals to control cracking. Concrete and asphalt have relatively weak tensile strength, and typically form cracks as they age, shrink, and are exposed to environmental stresses (including stresses of thermal expansion and contraction). Without the control joint, cracking can occur in a random fashion, and compromise the surface of the structure. This is primarily an aesthetic issue. Control joints attenuate the cracking in a more controlled fashion. The cracks will tend to form along the cut planes that makes up the control joints. This even, regular cracking, which is also hidden in the crevice of the joint, has a better appearance than random hairline cracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cement.org/learn/concrete-technology/concrete-construction/contraction-control-joints-in-concrete-flatwork|title=Placing Joints in Concrete Flatwork- Why, How, and When|website=www.cement.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, expansion joints ''reduce cracks'', including in the overall structure, while control joints ''manage cracks,'' primarily along the visual surface.

Roadway control joints may be sealed with hot tar, cold sealant (such as silicone), or compression sealant (such as rubber or [https://www.kampun.com/expansion-joint-filler-boards-kampun-hd100-board/ polymers based crossed linked foams].).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kampun.com/expansion-joint-filler-boards-kampun-hd100-board/ Expansion Joint Filler boards' properties/features and applications.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortar with a breakaway bond may be used to fill some control joints.

Control joints must have adequate depth and not exceed maximum spacing for them to be effective. Typical specifications for a four-inch-thick slab are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.concretenetwork.com/concrete/slabs/controljoints.htm|title=Placing Control Joints in Concrete – The Concrete Network|website=www.concretenetwork.com|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 25% depth of material
* spacing at 24x to 36x of slab depth (some specification call for a maximum of 30x)
* special care for inside corners

==Railway expansion joints==
{{See also|Breather switch}}
[[File:Expansion joint, Hayle.jpg|thumb|An expansion joint on the [[Cornish Main Line]], England]]
If a railway track runs over a bridge which has expansion joints that move more than a few millimeters, the track must be able to compensate this longer expansion or contraction. On the other hand, the track must always provide a continuous surface for the wheels travelling over it. These conflicting targets are served by special expansion joints, where two rails glide along each other at a very acute angle during expansion or contraction. They are typically seen near one or both ends of large steel bridges. Such an expansion joint looks somewhat like the tongue of a [[railroad switch]], but it has a completely different purpose and operation.

==Ducted air systems==
Expansion joints are required in large ducted air systems to allow fixed pieces of piping to be largely free of stress as thermal expansion occurs. Bends in elbows also can accommodate this. Expansion joints also isolate pieces of equipment such as fans from the rigid ductwork thereby reducing vibration to the ductwork as well as allowing the fan to “grow” as it comes up to the operating air system temperature without putting stress on the fan or the fixed portions of ductwork.
Example of air or gas ducts can be seen here. [http://www.pentamet.ee/product/air-flue-gas-ducts/ Air ducts]

An expansion joint is designed to allow deflection in the axial (compressive), lateral (shear), or angular (bending) deflections. Expansion joints can be non-metallic or metallic (often called bellows type). Non-metallic can be a single ply of rubberized material or a composite made of multiple layers of heat and erosion resistant flexible material. Typical layers are: outer cover to act a gas seal, a corrosion-resistant material such as Teflon, a layer of fiberglass to act as an
insulator and to add durability, several layers of insulation to ensure that the heat transfer from the flue gas is reduced to the required temperature and an inside layer.

A bellows is made up of a series of one or more convolutions of metal to allow the axial, lateral, or angular deflection.

==Pipe expansion joints==
{{main article|Metal expansion joint}}
[[File:Flanged Rubber Bellows.jpg|right|thumb|Single sphere rubber bellows expansion joint, with [[flange]]s.]]
[[File:Kompensator (Rohr).jpg|right|thumb|Stainless steel pipe expansion joint, with control rods.]]
Pipe expansion joints are necessary in systems that convey high temperature substances such as [[steam]] or exhaust gases, or to absorb movement and vibration. A typical joint is a [[bellows]] of metal (most commonly [[stainless steel]]), plastic (such as [[PTFE]]), fabric (such as glass fibre) or an [[elastomer]] such as [[rubber]]. Most common types of '''[http://www.pentamet.ee/gallery/ expansion joints]''' can be seen on '''[http://www.pentamet.ee/ Pentamet]''' website. A bellows is made up of a series of convolutions, with the shape of the convolution designed to withstand the internal pressures of the pipe, but flexible enough to accept axial, lateral, and angular deflections. Expansion joints are also designed for other criteria, such as noise absorption, anti-vibration, [[earthquake]] movement, and building settlement. Metal expansion joints have to be designed according to rules laid out by EJMA, for fabric expansion joints there are  guidelines and a state-of-the-art description by the Quality Association for Fabric Expansion Joints. Pipe expansion joints are also known as "compensators", as they compensate for the thermal movement. [https://www.new-line.com/imagelib/hose/expansion-joints.png?sfvrsn=0 Typical pump and piping layout using expansion joints].
The [http://www.bestexpansionjoint.com rubber expansion joints], the most frequently used equipment in the pipeline system, boast such functions as vibration reduction, dispalcement compensation and so on. Some [http://www.bestexpansionjoint.com/Technical-Information/rubber-flanged-expansion-bellows-160.html rubber additives] are often used during the production process of rubber expasnion joints. However, the most frequently used additives include eight types, which are necessary in the production of rubber expansion joints.

===Pressure balanced expansion joints===
Expansion joints are often included in industrial piping systems to accommodate movement due to thermal and mechanical changes in the system. When the process requires large changes in temperature, metal components change size. Expansion joints with metal bellows are designed to accommodate certain movements while minimizing the transfer of forces to sensitive components in the system.

Pressure created by pumps or gravity is used to move fluids through the piping system. Fluids under pressure occupy the volume of their container. The unique concept of pressure balanced expansion joints is they are designed to maintain a constant volume by having balancing bellows compensate for volume changes in the bellows (line bellows) which is moved by the pipe. An early name for these devices was “pressure-volumetric compensator”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbellows.com/technical/pressure_balanced.htm Technical Bulletin: Pressure Balanced Expansion Joints], U.S. Bellows, Inc. (retrieved 31 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing of rubber expansion joints==

===Wrapping fabric reinforced rubber sheets===
Rubber expansion joints are mainly manufactured by manual wrapping of rubber sheets and fabric reinforced rubber sheets around a bellows-shaped product mandrel. Besides rubber and fabric, reinforced rubber and/or steel wires or metal rings are added for additional reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elastomeric Expansion Joint Components|url=https://www.gallagherseals.com/blog/elastomeric-expansion-joint-components/|website=Gallagher Fluid Seals|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the entire product is built up on the mandrel, it is covered with a winding of (nylon) peel ply to pressurize all layers together. Because of the labor-intensive production process, a large part of the production has moved to eastern Europe and Asian countries.
In real life rubber or also called elastomer expansion joint can be seen here. [http://www.pentamet.ee/corporation/ Rubber expansion joint].

===Molded rubber expansion joints===
Some types of rubber expansion joints are made with a molding process. Typical joints that are molded are medium-sized expansion joints with bead rings, which are produced in large quantities. These rubber expansion joints are manufactured on a cylindrical mandrel, which is wrapped with bias cut fabric ply. At the end the bead rings are positioned and the end sections are folded inwards over the bead rings. This part is finally placed in a mold and molded into shape and vulcanized. This is a highly automated solution for large quantities of  the same type of joint.

===Automated winding of rubber expansion joints===
New technology has been developed to wind rubber and reinforcement layers on the (cylindrical or bellows-shaped) mandrel automatically using industrial robots instead of manual wrapping. This is fast and accurate and provides repeatable high quality. Another aspect of using industrial robots for the production of rubber expansion joints is the possibility to apply an individual reinforcement layer instead of using pre-woven fabric. The fabric reinforcement is pre-woven and cut at the preferred bias angle.

===Liners===
Internal liners can be used to either protect the metallic bellows from erosion or reduce turbulence across the bellows. They must be used when purge connectors are included in the design. In order to provide enough clearance in the liner design, appropriate lateral and angular movements must be specified by the designer. When designing an expansion joint with combination ends, flow direction must be specified as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbellows.com/expansion-joint-catalog/internal.htm U.S. Bellows Catalog: Internal Liner], U.S. Bellows, Inc. (retrieved 31 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Covers===
External covers should be used to protect the internal bellows from being damaged. They also serve a purpose as insulation of the bellows. Covers can either be designed as removable or permanent accessories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbellows.com/expansion-joint-catalog/protecti.htm U.S. Bellows Catalog: Protective Cover], U.S. Bellows, Inc. (retrieved 31 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Particulate barriers/purge connectors===
In systems that have a media with significant particulate content (i.e. flash or catalyst), a barrier of ceramic fiber can be utilized to prevent corrosion and restricted bellows flexibility resulting from the accumulation of the particulate. Purge connectors may also be utilized to perform this same function. Internal liners must also be included in the design if the expansion joint includes purge connectors or particulate barriers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbellows.com/expansion-joint-catalog/purge.htm U.S. Bellows Catalog: Purge Connector], U.S. Bellows, Inc. (retrieved 31 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limit rods===
Limit rods may be used in an expansion joint design to limit the axial compression or expansion. They allow the expansion joint to move over a range according to where the nut stops are placed along the rods. Limit rods are used to prevent bellows over-extension while restraining the full pressure thrust of the system.

==Failure modes==
Expansion joint failure can occur for various reasons, but experience shows that failures falls into several distinct categories. This list includes, but is not limited to: shipping and handling damage, improper installation/insufficient protection, during/after installation, improper anchoring, guiding, and supporting of the system, anchor failure in service, corrosion, system over-pressure, excessive bellows deflection, torsion, bellows erosion, and particulate matter in bellows convolutions restricting proper movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbellows.com/expansion-joint-catalog/joint-failure-causes.htm Typical Causes of Expansion Joint Failure] U.S. Bellows, (retrieved February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various actions that can be taken to prevent and minimize expansion joint failure. During installation, prevent any damage to the bellows by carefully following the instructions furnished by the manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbellows.com/expansion-joint-catalog/installa.htm Installation] U.S. Bellows, (retrieved February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; After installation, carefully inspect the entire piping system to see if any damage occurred during installation, if the expansion joint is in the proper location, and if the expansion joint flow direction and positioning is correct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbellows.com/expansion-joint-catalog/post-install-pretest.htm Post Installation Inspection Prior to System Pressure Test] U.S. Bellows, (retrieved February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, periodically inspect the expansion joint throughout the operating life of the system in order to check for external corrosion, loosening of threaded fasteners and deterioration of anchors, guides, and other hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbellows.com/expansion-joint-catalog/inservic.htm Periodic In-Service Inspection] U.S. Bellows, (retrieved February 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other expansion joint types==
Other types of expansion joints can include: fabric expansion joint, metal expansion joint, [[toroidal expansion joint]], gimbal expansion joint, universal expansion joint, in-line expansion joint, refractory lined expansion joint, and more.

[[File:F-ratio.png|thumb|right|Empirically derived effect of temperature and Net Primary Productivity on the f-ratio, and approximate values for some large ocean regions.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}]]
In [[ocean]]ic [[biogeochemistry]], the '''f-ratio''' is the fraction of total [[primary production]] fuelled by [[nitrate]] (as opposed to that fuelled by other [[nitrogen]] [[chemical compound|compounds]] such as [[ammonium]]). The ratio was originally defined by Richard Eppley and Bruce Peterson in one of the first [[Academic publishing#Academic paper|papers]] estimating global oceanic production.&lt;ref name=eppley&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/282677a0 | last1=Eppley | first1=R.W. |last2=Peterson |first2=B.J. | year=1979 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v282/n5740/abs/282677a0.html | title=Particulate organic matter flux and planktonic new production in the deep ocean | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=282 | pages=677–680 | issue=5740|bibcode = 1979Natur.282..677E }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fraction was originally believed significant because it appeared to directly relate to the [[export production|sinking (export) flux]] of [[organic compound|organic]] [[marine snow]] from the [[photic zone|surface ocean]] by the [[biological pump]]. However, this interpretation relied on the assumption of a strong depth-partitioning of a parallel process, [[nitrification]], that more recent measurements has questioned.&lt;ref name="dore96"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.4319/lo.1996.41.8.1619 | last1=Dore |first1=J.E. | last2=Karl | first2=D.M. | year=1996 | title=Nitrification in the euphotic zone as a source for nitrite, nitrate, and nitrous oxide at Station ALOHA | journal=Limnol.

==Overview==
[[Gravity|Gravitational]] sinking of [[organism]]s (or the remains of organisms) transfers [[carbon]] from the surface waters of the ocean to its [[aphotic zone|deep interior]].  This process is known as the biological pump, and quantifying it is of interest to scientists because it is an important aspect of the [[Earth]]'s [[carbon cycle]].  Essentially, this is because carbon transported to the deep ocean is isolated from the atmosphere, allowing the ocean to act as a reservoir of carbon.  This biological mechanism is accompanied by a physico-chemical mechanism known as the [[solubility pump]] which also acts to transfer carbon to the ocean's deep interior.

Measuring the flux of sinking material (so-called marine snow) is usually done by deploying [[sediment trap]]s which intercept and store material as it sinks down the [[water column]].  However, this is a relatively difficult process, since traps can be awkward to deploy or recover, and they must be left ''in situ'' over a long period to integrate the sinking flux.  Furthermore, they are known to experience biases and to integrate horizontal as well as vertical fluxes because of water currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Thomas | first1=S. | last2=Ridd | first2=P.V. | year=2004 | title=Review of methods to measure short time scale sediment accumulation | journal=Marine Geology | volume=207 | pages=95–114 | doi=10.1016/j.margeo.2004.03.011 | bibcode=2004MGeol.207...95T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Buesseler | first1=K.O. | author-link1=Ken Buesseler | year=2007 | title=An assessment of the use of sediment traps for estimating upper ocean particle fluxes | journal=J.

The f-ratio is one such proxy.

=="New" and "regenerated" production==
[[Image:F ratio diagram.gif|thumb|256px|right|Diagram of '''new''' and '''regenerated''' production]]

Bio-available nitrogen occurs in the ocean in several forms, including simple ionic forms such as nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;), [[nitrite]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;) and ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), and more complex organic forms such as [[urea]] ((NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO).  These forms are used by [[autotroph]]ic [[phytoplankton]] to synthesise organic molecules such as [[amino acid]]s (the building blocks of [[protein]]s).  [[Grazing]] of phytoplankton by [[plankton|zooplankton]] and larger organisms transfers this organic nitrogen up the [[food chain]] and throughout the marine [[food-web]].

When nitrogenous organic molecules are ultimately [[metabolism|metabolised]] by organisms, they are returned to the water column as ammonium (or more complex molecules that are then metabolised to ammonium).  This is known as ''regeneration'', since the ammonium can be used by phytoplankton, and again enter the food-web.  Primary production fuelled by ammonium in this way is thus referred to as '''regenerated production'''.&lt;ref name=dugdale&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.4319/lo.1967.12.2.0196 | last1=Dugdale | first1=R.C. | last2=Goering | first2=J.J. | year=1967 | url=http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_12/issue_2/0196.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720112630/http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_12/issue_2/0196.pdf | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2011-07-20 | title=Uptake of new and regenerated forms of nitrogen in primary productivity | journal=Limnol. Oceanogr. | volume=12 | pages=196–206 | issue=2 | bibcode=1967LimOc..12..196D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ammonium can also be [[oxidation|oxidised]] to nitrate (via nitrite), by the process of nitrification.  This is performed by different [[bacteria]] in two stages :

:::'''NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; + 3H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;
:::NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → '''NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;''' + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;

Crucially, this process is believed to only occur in the absence of [[light]] (or as some other [[function (mathematics)|function]] of depth).  In the ocean, this leads to a vertical separation of nitrification from [[primary production]], and confines it to the [[aphotic zone]].  This leads to the situation whereby any nitrate in the water column must be from the aphotic zone, and must have originated from organic material transported there by sinking.  Primary production fuelled by nitrate is, therefore, making use of a "fresh" nutrient source rather than a regenerated one.  Production by nitrate is thus referred to as '''new production'''.&lt;ref name=dugdale/&gt;

The figure at the head of this section illustrates this.  Nitrate and ammonium are taken up by primary producers, processed through the food-web, and then regenerated as ammonium.  Some of this return flux is released into the surface ocean (where it is available again for uptake), while some is returned at depth.  The ammonium returned at depth is nitrified to nitrate, and ultimately [[turbulence|mixed]] or [[upwelling|upwelled]] into the surface ocean to repeat the cycle.

Consequently, the significance of new production lies in its connection to sinking material.  At [[dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], the export flux of organic material sinking into the aphotic zone is balanced by the upward flux of nitrate.  By measuring how much nitrate is consumed by primary production, relative to that of regenerated ammonium, one should be able to estimate the export flux indirectly.

As an aside, the f-ratio can also reveal important aspects of local ecosystem function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Allen | first=A.E. |author2=Howard-Jones, M.H. |author3=Booth, M.G. |author4=Frischer, M.E. |author5=Verity, P.G. |author6=Bronk, D.A. |author7=Sanderson, M.P. | year=2002 | doi=10.1016/s0924-7963(02)00171-9 | title=Importance of heterotrophic bacterial assimilation of ammonium and nitrate in the Barents Sea during summer | journal=Journal of Marine Systems | volume=38 | pages=93–108 |bibcode = 2002JMS....38...93A }}&lt;/ref&gt;  High f-ratio values are typically associated with productive ecosystems dominated by large, [[eukaryotic]] phytoplankton (such as [[diatom]]s) that are grazed by large zooplankton (and, in turn, by larger organisms such as fish).  By contrast, low f-ratio values are generally associated with low biomass, [[oligotroph]]ic food webs consisting of small, [[prokaryotic]] phytoplankton (such as ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'') which are kept in check by microzooplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1029/1999GB001229 | last=Laws | first=E.A. |author2=Falkowski, P.G. |author3=Smith, W.O. |author4=Ducklow, H. |author5=McCarthy, J.J. | year=2000 | url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2000/1999GB001229.shtml | title=Temperature effects on export production in the open ocean | journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles | volume=14 | pages=1231–1246 | bibcode=2000GBioC..14.1231L | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dunne&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dunne | first=J.P. |author2=Armstrong, R.A. |author3=Gnanadesikan, A. |author4=Sarmiento, J.L.  | year=2005 | url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2005/2004GB002390.shtml | title=Empirical and mechanistic models for the particle export ratio | journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles | volume=19 | pages=GB4026 | doi=10.1029/2005GB002390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions==
[[Image:F ratio diagram 2.gif|thumb|256px|right|Is nitrification really confined to the aphotic zone?]]

A fundamental assumption in this interpretation of the f-ratio is the spatial separation of primary production and nitrification.  Indeed, in their original paper, Eppley &amp; Peterson noted that: "To relate new production to export requires that nitrification in the euphotic zone be negligible".&lt;ref name=eppley/&gt;  However, subsequent observational work on the distribution of nitrification has found that nitrification can occur at shallower depths, and even within the photic zone.&lt;ref name="dore96" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1029/1998JC900004 | last=Raimbault | first=P. |author2=Slawyk, G. |author3=Boudjellal, B. |author4=Coatanoan, C. |author5=Conan, P. |author6=Coste, B. |author7=Garcia, N. |author8=Moutin, T. |author9=Pujo-Pay, M. | year=1999 | url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1999/1998JC900004.shtml | title=Carbon and nitrogen uptake and export in the equatorial Pacific at 150°W: Evidence of an efficient regenerated production cycle | journal=J. Geophys. Res. | volume=104 | pages=3341–3356 | bibcode=1999JGR...104.3341R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.3354/meps197051 | last1=Diaz | first1=F. | last2=Raimbault | first2=P. | year=2000 | url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v197/p51-65/ | title=Nitrogen regeneration and dissolved organic nitrogen release during spring in a NW Mediterranean coastal zone (Gulf of Lions): implications for the estimation of new production | journal=Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. | volume=197 | pages=51–65 | bibcode=2000MEPS..197...51D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the adjacent diagram shows, if ammonium is indeed nitrified to nitrate in the ocean's surface waters it essentially "[[short circuit]]s" the deep pathway of nitrate.  In practice, this would lead to an overestimation of new production and a higher f-ratio, since some of the ostensibly new production would actually be fuelled by recently nitrified nitrate that had never left the surface ocean.  After including nitrification measurements in its parameterisation, an [[ecosystem model]] of the [[oligotroph]]ic [[subtropical gyre]] region (specifically the [[Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study|BATS]] site) found that, on an annual basis, around 40% of surface nitrate was recently nitrified (rising to almost 90% during summer).&lt;ref name=martin06&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Martin | first1=A.P. | last2=Pondaven | first2=P. | year=2006 | url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2006/2005GB002608.shtml | title=New primary production and nitrification in the western subtropical North Atlantic: a modelling study | journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles | volume=20 | doi=10.1029/2005GB002608 | bibcode=2006GBioC..20.4014M | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further study synthesising geographically diverse nitrification measurements found high variability but no relationship with depth, and applied this in a global-scale model to estimate that up to a half of surface nitrate is supplied by surface nitrification rather than upwelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Yool | first1=A. | last2=Martin | first2=A.P. | last3=Fernández | first3=C. | last4=Clark | first4=D.R. | year=2007 | title=The significance of nitrification for oceanic new production | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=447 | pages=999–1002 | doi=10.1038/nature05885 | issue=7147|bibcode = 2007Natur.447..999Y | pmid=17581584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although measurements of the rate of nitrification are still relatively rare, they do suggest that the f-ratio is not as straightforward a proxy for the biological pump as was once thought.  For this reason, some workers have proposed distinguishing between the f-ratio and the ratio of particulate export to primary production, which they term the '''pe-ratio'''.&lt;ref name=dunne/&gt;  While quantitatively different than the f-ratio, the pe-ratio shows similar qualitative variation between high productivity/high biomass/high export regimes and low productivity/low biomass/low export regimes.

In addition, a further process that potentially complicates the use of the f-ratio to estimate "new" and "regenerated" production is [[dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium]] (DNRA). In low oxygen environments, such as [[oxygen minimum zone]]s and seafloor sediments, [[Chemoorganoheterotrophy|chemoorganoheterotrophic]] microbes use nitrate as an [[electron acceptor]] for [[cellular respiration|respiration]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraft, B. Strous, M. and Tegetmeyer, H. E.|first=|year=2011|title=Microbial nitrate respiration – Genes, enzymes and environmental distribution|url=|journal=Journal of Biotechnology|volume=155|pages=104–117|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.12.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing it to nitrite, then to ammonium. Since, like nitrification, DNRA alters the balance in the availability of nitrate and ammonium, it has the potential to introduce inaccuracy to the calculated f-ratio. However, as DNRA's occurrence is limited to anaerobic situations,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lam, Phyllis and Kuypers, Marcel M.

F International was founded in 1962 when successful female entrepreneurs and freelance working were rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Becoming a Metapreneur | author=Lessem, Ronnie | journal=Journal of General Management | volume=11 | number=4 | pages=5–21 | year=1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Case Study: Growth and Change at F International | author=Symons, Rosemary | booktitle=Businesswoman | pages=142–150 | year=1987 | publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Evans |first1=Pam |year=  |editor1-last= Davidson  |editor1-first= Marilyn J.  |editor2-last= Cooper |editor2-first= Cary L.  |title= Women Homeworkers and Information Technology - The F International Experience |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages= 227–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Shirley]] started the company despite having no capital or business experience, to escape the constraints of working as a woman in a predominantly male working context:&lt;ref name="Let IT go"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Let IT Go: The Memoirs of Dame Stephanie Shirley|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ciy6BAAAQBAJ|publisher = Andrews UK Limited|date = 2014-06-10|isbn = 9781782341536|first = Dame Stephanie|last = Shirley|first2 = Richard|last2 = Askwith}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|loc 923}}

In so far as it existed, it was given away free.|source=[[Steve Shirley|Dame Stephanie Shirley]].&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 997}}}}

The total revenues for the first 10-month tax year were £1,700.&lt;ref name="HCase01" /&gt;

The [[Cranfield School of Management]] undertook a study of the reported differences between male and female [[entrepreneur]]s in the late 1980s, concluding that because of the differences in context and background for men and women, the principal factor for successful women [[entrepreneur]]s was the nature of market entry.&lt;ref name="Birley01"&gt;{{cite journal | last       = Birley | first      = Sue | date       = 1988 | title      = Female Entrepreneurs - are they really any different? | url        = https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1826/439/SWP0587.pdf?sequence=2 | journal    = Cranfield School of Management Working Papers | volume     = SWP 5/87 | issue      =  | pages      =  | doi        =  | access-date = 2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; F International is an early example: business and industry were short of computer-skilled people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Software Technology in the 1990s | author = Balzer, Robert and Green, Cordell | journal = Computer | number = 11 | pages = 39–45 | year = 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the nature of much software and systems work was, even at that time, amenable to [[homeworking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Failed technology futures: pitfalls and lessons from a historical survey | author = Geels, Frank W and Smit, Wim A  | journal = Futures | year = 2000 | page = 875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The company, then known as "[[Freelance Programmers]]", was registered on 13 May 1964 and a "panel" of [[freelance]] software and systems specialists, almost exclusively female, began to work for the company. An early assignment came from [[Urwick Diebold]] and this attracted attention from the media.&lt;ref name="Computer women"&gt;{{citation|year=1964|title=Computer women|publisher=The Guardian, 31st January}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early days were difficult; at one point [[Kit Grindley]], a recent acquaintance at Urwick Diebold, wrote Steve a cheque for £500 to cover operating costs and payments to the workforce.&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 1166}} Once over the early [[cash flow]] problems the business began to grow. By 1966, there were about 75 regular freelance workers on the panel,&lt;ref name="HCase01" /&gt; some of whom became significant role players as technical experts and project managers&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 1762}}.  Seriously problematic projects were rare, but one in particular, with [[Castrol]], forced the management team to focus on [[quality management]].&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 1226}} Quality management became one of the foundations of the operating model for the company.&lt;ref name="QM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, F., "Change-Related Behaviour and Information Systems", OMEGA, Vol. 16, No. 5, pp. 369-381, Sep-Oct 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start, in the 1960s, there were no accessible [[data communication]]s services and no [[Internet]], but in the 1970s the business attracted interest from [[academic]]s and [[futurist]]s as an example of what became known as [[teleworking]] or [[telecommuting]].&lt;ref name="futures01"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Geels | first1 = Frank W  | last2 = Smit | first2 = Wim A | journal = Futures | year = 2000 | title = Failed technology futures: pitfalls and lessons from a historical survey  | pages = 875}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Harvard Business School]] documented the F International business in a number of case studies.&lt;ref name="HCase01"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Franklin, Diane | year = 1986 | title = F International | publisher = Harvard Business School | id = Case numbers: 486-118, 486-119 and 486-120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HCase02"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zuboff | first1 = Shoshana  | last2 = Delong | first2 = David  | date = 1989-09-01 | title = Steve Shirley  | publisher = Harvard Business School | id = Case number: 490004-PDF-ENG}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business was the subject of several other international academic studies of homeworking. &lt;ref name="Thomas01"&gt; {{cite report | first1 = Neil | last1 = Thomas | first2 = Connie  | last2 = Conner | title=At home in the office - A Guide for the Homeworker | publisher=Office for Research in High Technology Education, College of Education, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN | date=December 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh01"&gt;{{cite thesis | type = Masters | first = Joseph P | last = Cavanaugh | date = December 1991 | title = The Social and Behavioral Impacts of Information Systems in the Automated Office: A Literature Review | publisher = Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
In the 1970s the company's development paralleled the emergence of [[feminist]] thinking and the consequent awareness and pre-occupation with [[gender equality]]; together these led to legislation in the [[United Kingdom]] that was intended to bring equal rights to women but had unexpected consequences;  F International was specifically offering employment ''to women'', and therefore they had to adjust their policies to be ''gender-independent''.&lt;ref name="SexAct"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1975/65 | title = Sex Discrimination Act 1975 | last   = UK Government | date  = 1975 | website  = The National Archives | access-date= 2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I felt strongly that my “female” approach, which had attracted such scorn in the business’s early years, had been vindicated, and it irked me that the state, in addition to its other meddlings, had now declared that approach illegal. Still, there was no point in quarrelling with the law, especially such a well-intentioned one. At a board meeting ... we amended our personnel policy again. Our purpose was now to provide employment for “people with dependants unable to work in a conventional environment.|source=[[Steve Shirley|Dame Stephanie Shirley]].&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 1897}}}}

Despite these issues, the business continued to grow until the 1970s, when it encountered difficulties for at least two reasons: the business reported its first financial loss (of £3,815) and suffered its first significant personnel loss, when Pamela Woodman resigned to form [[Pamela Woodman Associates]], working in direct competition to Freelance Programmers.&lt;ref name="HCase01" /&gt; However, by the end of the decade, [[revenue]] had risen to £2.5m and there was a partnership with Heights Information Technology Services Inc in the [[USA]], F International ApS in [[Copenhagen]], servicing [[Scandinavia]], and F International BV in [[Amsterdam]], servicing the [[Benelux]] countries;&lt;ref name = "FI2"&gt;FI newsletter, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; At home, still in the 1970s, spin-off businesses were re-absorbed into the parent business which was re-established in 1974 as "F International".&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 1838}}

By 1980 the business had developed country-wide coverage with more than 600 staff.&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 2342}} The administrative headquarters for the [[UK]] were then based in [[Chesham]], [[Buckinghamshire]], where the original organisation, Freelance Programmers had been founded. 

F International was a founder member of the [[Computing Services Association]], and was active in the [[British Computer Society]] and the [[Institute for Data Processing Management]] (IDPM)&lt;ref name="FI1"&gt;F International Group hand-out for clients, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the early 1980s that a wider general interest in home working with telecommunications support became evident, a phenomenon that later known as [[teleworking]] or [[telecommuting]].&lt;ref name="Huws01"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Huws, Ursula | year = January 1991 | title = Telework: Projections | journal = Futures }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later history===

As the 1990s opened, the company made several strategic acquisitions, for example [[AMP Computer Recruitment]] in 1990 and the [[Kernel Group]] in 1991, with the objective of providing clients with staffing and training services. In 1997, [[IIS Infotech Limited]], an Indian computer services company based in [[New Delhi]] was acquired, joined in 1999 by a small [[London]]-based project management and IT consultancy group and in 2000 by Druid, a [[Reading]]-based software consultancy.&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 3773}}

In March 2001, now  a substantial and international business with over 6,000 employees, a market capitalisation of £1.2bn and projected sales for the coming year of £515m, the company announced that it was going to change its name to [[Xansa plc]].&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 3926}}

==Philosophy and method of working==

The founding idea at F International was to provide meaningful home-based employment for young mothers with software skills, and later (when challenged by the legislation on sex discrimination) for “people with dependents unable to work in a conventional environment". &lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 1897}} 

Although for the first decade the F International workforce communicated successfully on a daily basis, using the United Kingdom overnight first class mail service, home working became increasingly interesting and increasingly accepted as telecommunications services became available. The F International story attracted extensive public and professional interest, for example in [[Tomorrow%27s World]] (a long-running BBC science and technology programme), and books by [[Ralf Dahrendorf]], &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  Steve herself continued to write and speak about the business model and the benefits for the workforce.&lt;ref name="Telematics01"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Shirley, Steve | year = 1985 | pages = 165-168 | title = F international: A unique approach to computer consulting | journal = Telematics and Informatics Volume 2, Issue 2 | publisher = Elsevier | doi = 10.1016/S0736-5853(85)80010-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book "The Third Wave"&lt;ref name="Toffler01" /&gt; [[Alvin Toffler]] included a Chapter on "The Electronic Cottage" wherein he quotes from a 1971 report by the Institute for the Future suggesting a range of occupations that could be undertaken from home, and mentioning F International as one example. Toffler wrote (quoting from the IFF report):

{{quote| ... many of the present duties of the secretary "''could be done from home as well as in the office. Such a system would increase the labor pool by allowing married secretaries caring for small children at home to continue to work ... there may be no overriding reason why a secretary could not just as well, in many instances, take dictation at home and type the text on a home terminal which produces a clean text at the author's home or office.''" In addition, IFF continued, "''Many of the tasks performed by engineers, draftsmen, and other white-collar employees might be done from home as readily as, or sometimes more readily than, from the office.' One "seed of the future" exists already in Britain, for example, where a company called F. International Ltd. (the "F" stands for Freelance) employs 400 part-time computer programmers, all but a handful of whom work in their own homes. The company, which organizes teams of programmers for industry, has expanded to Holland and Scandinavia and counts among its clients such giants as British Steel, Shell, and Unilever.'' |source=[[Alvin Toffler]]. &lt;ref name="Toffler01" /&gt;{{rp|215}}}}

In a book concerning adapting to change in the world of work (and surviving) [[Michel Syrett]] summarised some of the particulars of working with F International: 

{{quote| Around 71 per cent of staff work from home — ideal for married women, and for a slowly growing number of men who likewise appreciate being able to care for children, or maybe start their own business. Hours are from a minimum of 20 a week when a project is underway ... contact with head office and the five regional sales offices is through project managers and staffing co-ordinators. In essence the company uses the skills of women who have opted out of the everyday labour market after having had at least four years work experience with computers. |source=[[Michel Syrett]] &lt;ref name="Syrett01" /&gt;{{rp|24-25}}}}

More recently Steve Shirley has observed that the F International way of working presaged many features of the [[gig economy]]:  flexibility, variable remuneration for different modes of working, and a high level of self-reliance. Comments from [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] (in a television programme marking his retirement from the London School of Economics) support this idea.  When he addressed the question: 'Has Britain got a future?', he said: 

{{quote| Some answers may be found in Party Manifestos. But the real changes are to be found where people live and work. F International has several characteristics which make it a model. It allows people to organise their own lives; it decentralises management decisions; it makes effective use of modern technology — and of course, it is successful.  |source= Dahrendorf on Britain, BBC1, January 1983 &lt;ref name="Kinsman01" /&gt;{{rp|55}}}}

==Working standards==

As well as a Quality Manual &lt;ref name="QM" /&gt; there were ten other management manuals dealing with: [[quality policy]], [[project management]], [[estimating]], and technical standards for general work, [[consulting]] work, [[systems design]], [[software documentation]], [[software testing]] and [[configuration management]]. The commitment gained from individuals who took direct responsibility for their own work, working by themselves at home, led to significant productivity gains of more than 40% when compared to conventional software and systems businesses. This was underpinned by the early focus on estimating and costing projects accurately in advance; there were sound systems in place to monitor progress, costs and quality.&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 4129}}

==Innovation and outreach==

Some aspects of the company's technical work on standards and methods were published in technical journals and presented at international conferences. Senior technical staff and management contributed to technical journals and conferences concerning issues such as management

&lt;ref name="Meth06"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Bytheway, Andy | year = September 1987| title = An open season on Standards| journal = Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper by Calow on maintenance is particularly interesting, because it explains how a strategy was devised to manage the maintenance of legacy systems, freeing mainline systems development staff to undertake productive work and significantly reducing the frequency of bugs and systems failures; this was a key feature of the F International strategy at the time.

A '''gas chamber''' is an apparatus for killing humans or other animals with gas, consisting of a sealed chamber into which a [[poison]]ous or [[asphyxiant gas]] is introduced. The most commonly used poisonous agent is [[hydrogen cyanide]]; [[carbon dioxide]] and [[carbon monoxide]] have also been used. Gas chambers were used as a method of execution for condemned prisoners in the United States beginning in the 1920s and continue to be a legal execution method in three states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/methods-execution |title=Methods of Execution - Death Penalty Information Center |publisher=deathpenaltyinfo.org |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225054450/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/methods-execution |archivedate=2011-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[the Holocaust]], large-scale gas chambers designed for mass killing were used by [[Nazi Germany]] as part of their [[genocide]] program. The use of gas chambers in [[North Korea]] has also been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Barnett |first=Antony |title=Revealed: the gas chamber horror of North Korea's gulag |newspaper=The Guardian |date=February 1, 2004 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/korea/article/0,2763,1136483,00.html |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |location=London}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nazi Germany]] made extensive use of various types of gas chamber for mass killing.

Beginning in 1939, gas chambers were used as part of the [[Aktion T4|Nazi euthanasia program]] aimed at eliminating physically and intellectually disabled people. Experiments in the gassing of patients were conducted in October 1939 in occupied [[Poznan|Posen]] in Poland. Hundreds of prisoners were killed by [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning in an improvised gas chamber.&lt;ref name="browning"&gt; {{cite book | title=The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 – March 1942 | publisher=Arrow |last=Browning |first=Christopher |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8032-5979-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 gas chambers using bottled pure carbon monoxide were established at six euthanasia centres in Germany.&lt;ref name="USHMM-HE"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005220 | title = Gassing Operations | last =  | first =  | date =  | website = Holocaust Encyclopedia | publisher = United States Holocaust Memorial Museum | access-date = 30 November 2017 | quote =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171203210358/https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005220 | archivedate = 3 December 2017 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to persons with disabilities, these centres were also used to kill prisoners transferred from concentration camps in Germany, Austria, and Poland. Killings of concentration camp inmates continued after the euthanasia program was officially shut down in 1941.&lt;ref name="klee"&gt;{{cite book | title=Euthanasie im NS-Staat.

During the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of Russia]], mass executions by [[exhaust gas]] were performed by ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' using [[gas van]]s, trucks modified to divert engine exhaust into a sealed interior gas chamber.&lt;ref name="USHMM-HE" /&gt; 

Starting in 1941, gas chambers were used at [[extermination camp]]s in Poland for the mass killing of [[Jews]], [[Romani people|Roma]], and other victims of [[the Holocaust]]. Gas vans were used at the [[Chełmno extermination camp]]. The [[Operation Reinhard]] extermination camps at [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]], [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]], and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] used exhaust fumes from stationary [[diesel engine]]s.&lt;ref name="USHMM-HE" /&gt; In search of more efficient killing methods, the Nazis experimented with using the [[hydrogen cyanide]]-based [[fumigation|fumigant]] [[Zyklon B]] at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. This method was adopted for mass killings at the Auschwitz and [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] camps. Up to 6000 victims were gassed with Zyklon-B each day at Auschwitz.&lt;ref name="USHMM-HE" /&gt;

Most extermination camp gas chambers were dismantled or destroyed in the last months of the [[World War II]] as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops approached, except for those at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] and Majdanek. One destroyed gas chamber at Auschwitz was reconstructed after the war to stand as a memorial.

==Lithuania==
In 1937–1940, [[Lithuania]] operated a gas chamber in [[Aleksotas]] within the First Fort of the [[Kaunas Fortress]].&lt;ref name=cernevic/&gt; Before, the executions were carried out by hanging or by shooting. However, these methods were viewed as brutal and in January 1937, the criminal code was amended to provide execution by gas which at the time was viewed as more civilized and humane. Lithuania considered and rejected execution by poison. The first execution was carried on July 27, 1937: Bronius Pogužinskas, age 37, convicted of murder of five people from a Jewish family.&lt;ref name=cernevic/&gt; Historian Sigita Černevičiūtė counted at least nine executions in the gas chamber, though records are incomplete and fragmentary. Of the nine, eight were convicted of murder. One, Aleksandras Maurušaitis, was in addition convicted of anti-government actions during the [[1935 Suvalkija strike]]. The last known execution took place on May 19, 1940 for robbery. The fate of the gas chamber after the [[Occupation of Lithuania by Soviet Union 1940|occupation by the Soviet Union]] in June 1940 is unclear.&lt;ref name=cernevic&gt;{{cite web |first=Sigita |last=Černevičiūtė |title=Dujų kamera prieškario Lietuvoje 1937-1940 metais |date=April 8, 2014 |url=http://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/istorija/duju-kamera-prieskario-lietuvoje-1937-1940-metais-582-418225 |publisher=15 min (republished from ''Naujasis Židinys-Aidai'') |language=lt |accessdate=2016-11-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127154408/http://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/istorija/duju-kamera-prieskario-lietuvoje-1937-1940-metais-582-418225 |archivedate=November 27, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gas chambers have been used for [[capital punishment in the United States]] to execute [[List of United States death row inmates|death row inmates]]. The first person to be executed in the United States by lethal gas was [[Gee Jon]], on February 8, 1924. An unsuccessful attempt to pump poison gas directly into his cell at [[Nevada State Prison]] led to the development of the first makeshift gas chamber to carry out Gee's death sentence.&lt;ref name="DPIC-Descriptions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/descriptions-execution-methods#gas |title=Descriptions of Execution Methods: Gas Chamber |publisher=[[Death Penalty Information Center]] |year=2010 |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112105603/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/descriptions-execution-methods#gas |archivedate=November 12, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, 1948, [[Miran Edgar Thompson|Miran Thompson]] and [[Sam Shockley]] were executed in the gas chamber at [[San Quentin State Prison]] for their role in the [[Battle of Alcatraz]].

In 1957, [[Burton Abbott]] was executed as the governor of California, [[Goodwin J.

At the September 2, 1983, execution of [[Jimmy Lee Gray]] in [[Mississippi]], officials cleared the viewing room after eight minutes while Gray was still alive and gasping for air. The decision to clear the room while he was still alive was criticized by his [[Attorneys in the United States|attorney]]. [[David Bruck]], an attorney specializing in death penalty cases, said, "Jimmy Lee Gray died banging his head against a steel pole in the gas chamber while reporters counted his moans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Some examples of post-Furman botched executions |publisher=Death Penalty Information Center |date=May 24, 2007 |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=8&amp;did=478 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122180900/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=8&amp;did=478 |archivedate=November 22, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray was convicted for the [[murder]] of three-year-old Deressa Jean Scales in 1976, after [[kidnapping]] and anally raping her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30B17FE395C0C718CDDA00894DB484D81 Killer Of 3-Year-Old Mississippi Girl Executed After Justices Reject Plea].

During the April 6, 1992, execution of [[Donald Harding (murderer)|Donald Harding]] in [[Arizona]], it took 11 minutes for death to occur. The prison warden stated that he would quit if required to conduct another gas chamber execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Weil |first=Elizabeth |title=The needle and the damage done |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 11, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/magazine/11injection.t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421134244/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/magazine/11injection.t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin |archivedate=April 21, 2017 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Harding's execution, Arizona voted that all persons condemned after November 1992 would be executed by lethal injection.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

California's gas chamber at San Quentin State Prison was converted to an execution chamber for lethal injection.

As of 2010, the last person to be executed in the gas chamber was German national [[Walter LaGrand]], sentenced to death before 1992, who was executed in [[Arizona]] on March 3, 1999. The [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] had ruled that he could not be executed by gas chamber, but the decision was overturned by the United States Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; The gas chamber was formerly used in [[Colorado]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Oregon]].

As implemented in the United States, the gas chamber is considered to be the most dangerous, most complicated, and most expensive method of administering the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Death and Dying'' by Clifton D.

Because hydrogen cyanide gas condenses at approximately 78&amp;nbsp;°F (26&amp;nbsp;°C), the temperature in the chamber (when it is in use) is maintained at a minimum of 80&amp;nbsp;°F (27&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zundelsite.org/archive/leuchter/report3/ch7000.html  Mississippi State Penitentiary, Leuchter report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706021251/http://www.zundelsite.org/archive/leuchter/report3/ch7000.html |date=2015-07-06 }} section 7.002&lt;/ref&gt;

The gas is visible to the condemned, who is advised to take several deep breaths to speed unconsciousness. Nonetheless, there are often convulsions and excessive drooling.  There may also be urinating, defecating, and vomiting.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Capital Punishment in the United States'', 2d ed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;by Louis J.

Following the execution the chamber is purged with air, and any remnant gas is neutralized with [[Ammonia|anhydrous ammonia]], after which the body can be removed (with great caution, as pockets of gas can be trapped in the victim's clothing).&lt;ref name="HCN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/descriptions-execution-methods#gas |title=Descriptions of Execution Methods |publisher=Death Penalty Information Center |accessdate=2 February 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202105345/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/descriptions-execution-methods#gas |archivedate=2 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes, as a safety precaution, the clothing worn by the executed person is destroyed by incineration.&lt;ref name="leuchter2"&gt;[http://www.zundelsite.org/archive/leuchter/report3/ch7000.html  Mississippi State Penitentiary, Leuchter report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706021251/http://www.zundelsite.org/archive/leuchter/report3/ch7000.html |date=2015-07-06 }} section 7.007&lt;/ref&gt;  The undertaker who handles the body wears rubber gloves for protection against any trace amounts of cyanide that might still be present on or in the body.&lt;ref name="leuchter2" /&gt;

====Excluding all oxygen====
{{main article|Inert gas asphyxiation}}
Nitrogen gas or oxygen-depleted air has been considered for human execution, as it can induce [[nitrogen asphyxiation]]. The victim detects little abnormal sensation as the oxygen level falls. This leads to [[asphyxia]]tion (death from lack of oxygen) without the painful and traumatic feeling of suffocation, or the side effects of poisoning.

In April 2015, [[Governor of Oklahoma|Oklahoma Governor]] [[Mary Fallin]] approved a bill allowing nitrogen asphyxiation as an execution method.&lt;ref name="newsok.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-gov.-mary-fallin-signs-bill-allowing-nitrogen-asphyxiation-as-alternative-execution-method/article/5411181 |title=Oklahoma Gov.

The '''History Aptitude Test''' ('''HAT''') is a [[standardized test]] used as part of the admissions process to [[Oxford University]] for undergraduates applying to read History, or a subject including history, for example English with History.

The two-hour test is currently only employed by Oxford University, though other universities are considering adopting a similar examination as part of admissions.

==Criticism==
In 2004 John Dunford, the general secretary of the [[Secondary Heads Association]] complained that the language used in the test could be seen as favouring those from independent schools.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/oct/11/accesstouniversity.highereducation&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[aesthetics]], the '''human figure''' or '''human form''' in art, sculpture and other art forms involves a study and appreciation of the [[beauty]] of the [[human]] body in its depiction or presentation. The study involves an appreciation of the [[Human body shape|body shape]], including [[Human positions|body postures]] - sitting, standing or even sleeping, and movements - [[Human gait|walking]], running, [[dancing]] etc. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]  refers to the human figure as the ideal of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aesthetics-online.org/ideas/leddy.html Section 17, Immanuel Kant]&lt;/ref&gt; The human figure conforms very well to the law that states that [[form follows function]], which is believed to be a result of [[evolution]] over thousands of generations.

The human figure is one of the most enduring themes in the visual arts. Very few art forms are not related to human figure such as [[music]], though it figures in [[lyrics]]. A study of the human figure includes a detailed study of the following subjects:
* [[Sculpture]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/HumanForm.html Human figure in various art forms]&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to figure drawing.
* [[Figure drawing]] involves the depiction of the body in different postures or in motion or at work.
* [[Literature]] involves the description of the human figure to imply its [[sexual attraction]], physical ability and mentality.
* [[Dance]] is an [[art form]] that involves [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the body, usually rhythmic and to music,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]], [[social]] [[Interpersonal relationship|interaction]] or presented in a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting.
* [[Body language]] involves [[human position|body posture]], [[gesture]]s, [[facial expression]]s, and [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]].
* [[Fashion]] and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]].
* [[Ergonomics]] in passenger vehicles and seatings, this deals with [[unisex]] approach to human figure.
* [[Gait analysis]]
* [[3D animation]]

== Body proportions ==
{{Main|Body proportions}}
''Body proportions'' are the study of relation of [[human anatomy|human body]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://realcolorwheel.com/human.htm Human Proportions]&lt;/ref&gt; or in general, animal body, parts to each other and the whole, essential for depiction of the overall figure.

== Sculpture and figure drawing ==
[[File:Carracci, Annibale - Studio di nudo.jpg|thumb|Nude study, by [[Annibale Carracci]]]]
{{See also|Sculpture|figure drawing}}
A [[figure drawing]] is a study of the human form in its various shapes and postures. It is a study or stylized depiction of the human form, with the line and form of the human figure as the primary objective, rather than the subject person. It is a composed image of the subject in a still position. A life drawing is a work that has been drawn from an observation of a live [[Model (art)|model]].

The '''Hydrothermal vent microbial community''' encompasses all unicellular organisms that live and reproduce in a chemically distinct area around [[Hydrothermal vent|Hydrothermal vents]]. These include organisms in the [[microbial mat]], free floating cells, or bacteria in an [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] relationship with animals. Chemolithoautotrophic bacteria derive nutrients and energy from the geological activity at Hydrothermal vents to fix carbon into organic forms. Viruses are also a part of the hydrothermal vent microbial community and their influence on the microbial ecology in these ecosystems is a burgeoning field of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Rika E.|last2=Brazelton|first2=William J.|last3=Baross|first3=John A.|date=2011|title=Is the genetic landscape of the deep subsurface biosphere affected by viruses?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22084639|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=2|pages=219|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2011.00219|issn=1664-302X|pmc=3211056|pmid=22084639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrothermal vents are located where the tectonic plates are moving apart and spreading. This allows water from the ocean to enter into the crust of the earth where it is heated by the magma. The increasing pressure and temperature forces the water back out of these openings, on the way out, the water accumulates dissolved minerals and chemicals from the rocks that it encounters. There are generally three kinds of vents that occur and are all characterized by its temperature and chemical composition. Diffuse vents release clear water typically up to 30°C. White smoker vents emit a milky coloured water that are approximately 200-330°C, black smoker vents generally release water hotter than the others between 300-400°C. The waters from black smokers are darkened by the precipitates of sulfide that are accumulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lutz|first=Richard A.|last2=Kennish|first2=Michael J.|date=1993|title=Ecology of deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities: A review|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|language=en|volume=31|issue=3|pages=211|doi=10.1029/93rg01280|issn=8755-1209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to there not being any sunlight at these ocean depths, energy is provided by [[chemosynthesis]] where symbiotic bacteria and archaea form the bottom of the food chain and are able to support a variety of organisms such as Riftia pachyptila and Alvinella pompejana. These organisms utilize this symbiotic relationship in order to utilize and obtain the chemical energy that is released at these hydrothermal vent areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kádár|first=Enikõ|last2=Costa|first2=Valentina|last3=Santos|first3=Ricardo S.|last4=Powell|first4=Jonathan J.|date=July 2006|title=Tissue partitioning of micro-essential metals in the vent bivalve Bathymodiolus azoricus and associated organisms (endosymbiont bacteria and a parasite polychaete) from geochemically distinct vents of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2006.01.002|journal=Journal of Sea Research|volume=56|issue=1|pages=45–52|doi=10.1016/j.seares.2006.01.002|issn=1385-1101}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
== Environmental Properties ==
[[File:Expl1296 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|236x236px|A cloud of effluent being expelled by a hydrothermal vent violently.|alt=|left]]Although there is a large variation in temperatures at the surface of the water with the changing depths of the [[thermocline]] seasonally, the temperatures underneath the thermocline and the waters near the deep sea are relatively constant. There aren’t any changes that are brought about by seasonal effects or annual changes. These temperatures stay in the range of 0-3°C with the exception of the waters immediately surrounding the hydrothermal vents which can get as high as 407°C.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.windows2universe.org/?page=/earth/water/temp.html|title=Temperature of Ocean Water - Windows to the Universe|website=www.windows2universe.org|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haase|first=K.

With increasing depth, the effects of pressure start to occur. The pressure is due to the weight of water above pushing down. The approximate rate of pressure increase in the ocean is 10Mega-pascals (MPa) for every kilometre that is traveled towards the seafloor. This means that [[Hydrostatics|hydrostatic pressure]] can reach up to 110MPa at the depths of the trenches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jebbar|first=Mohamed|last2=Franzetti|first2=Bruno|last3=Girard|first3=Eric|last4=Oger|first4=Philippe|date=2015-06-23|title=Microbial diversity and adaptation to high hydrostatic pressure in deep-sea hydrothermal vents prokaryotes|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00792-015-0760-3|journal=Extremophiles|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=721–740|doi=10.1007/s00792-015-0760-3|issn=1431-0651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinity stay relatively constant within the deep seas communities around the world at 35parts per thousand (ppt).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is no light in the hydrothermal vent environment so there are no organisms that can create energy from photosynthesis. Instead, the energy that the majority of organisms utilize comes from chemosynthesis. The organisms utilize the minerals and chemicals that come out of the vents.

== Adaptations ==
Extreme conditions in the hydrothermal vent environment means that microbial communities that inhabit these areas need to adapt to them. Microbes that live here are known to be hyperthermophiles which by definition are microorganisms that grow at temperatures above 90°C. These organisms are found where the fluids from the vents are expelled and mixed with the surrounding water. These hyperthermophilic microbes are thought to contain proteins that have extended stability at higher temperatures due to intramolecular interactions but the exact mechanisms are not clear yet. The stabilization mechanisms for DNA are not as unknown and the denaturation of DNA are thought to be minimized through high salt concentrations, more specifically Mg, K, and PO4 which are highly concentrated in hyperthermophiles. Along with this, many of the microbes have proteins similar to histones that are bound to the DNA and can offer protection against the high temperatures. Microbes are also found to be in symbiotic relationships with other organisms in the hydrothermal vent environment due to their ability to have a detoxification mechanism which allows them to metabolize the sulfide-rich waters which would otherwise be toxic to the organisms and the microbes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zierenberg|first=Robert A.|last2=Adams|first2=Michael W.

== Microbial Biogeochemistry ==

=== Introduction ===
[[File:Deep sea vent chemistry diagram.jpg|right|thumb|388x388px|A diagram showing the process of how seawater becomes a part of the hydrothermal effluent including the elements that are added and precipitated.]]Microbial communities at hydrothermal vents mediate the transformation of energy and minerals produced by geological activity into [[Organic matter|organic material]]. Organic matter produced by [[Autotroph|autotrophic]] bacteria is then used to support the upper [[Trophic level|trophic levels]]. The hydrothermal vent fluid and the surrounding ocean water is rich in elements such as [[iron]], [[manganese]] and various species of sulfur including [[sulfide]], [[sulfite]], [[sulfate]], [[Sulfur|elemental sulfur]] from which they can derive energy or nutrients.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kletzin|first=Arnulf|last2=Urich|first2=Tim|last3=Müller|first3=Fabian|last4=Bandeiras|first4=Tiago M.|last5=Gomes|first5=Cláudio M.|date=February 2004|title=Dissimilatory oxidation and reduction of elemental sulfur in thermophilic archaea|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15168612|journal=Journal of Bioenergetics and Biomembranes|volume=36|issue=1|pages=77–91|issn=0145-479X|pmid=15168612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbes derive energy by [[Redox|oxidizing or reducing]] elements. Different microbial species utilize different [[chemical species]] of an element in their [[Metabolism|metabolic]] processes. For example, some microbe species oxidize sulfide to sulfate and another species will reduce sulfate to elemental sulfur. As a result, a web of chemical pathways mediated by different microbial species transform elements such as carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and hydrogen, from one species to another. Their activity alters the original chemical composition produced by geological activity of the hydrothermal vent environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Carbon Cycle ===
Refer to [[Carbon cycle|Carbon Cycle]]

Geological activity at hydrothermal vents produce an abundance of [[Compounds of carbon|carbon compounds]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Hydrothermal vent plumes contain high concentrations of [[methane]] and [[carbon monoxide]] with methane concentration reaching 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; times of the surrounding ocean water.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Deep ocean water]] is also a large reservoir of carbon and concentration of carbon dioxide species such as dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; around 2.2mM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunk|first=Rachel M.|last2=Peltzer|first2=Edward T.|last3=Walz|first3=Peter M.|last4=Brewer|first4=Peter G.|date=2005-12-15|title=Seeing a deep ocean CO2 enrichment experiment in a new light: laser raman detection of dissolved CO2 in seawater|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16475344|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=39|issue=24|pages=9630–9636|issn=0013-936X|pmid=16475344}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bountiful carbon and electron acceptors produced by geological activity support an oasis of [[Chemotroph|chemoautotrophic]] microbial communities that fix inorganic carbon, such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt; using energy from sources such as oxidation of sulfur, iron, manganese, hydrogen and methane.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These bacteria supply a large portion of organic carbon that support [[Heterotroph|heterotrophic]] life at hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; 

==== Carbon Fixation ====
[[Carbon fixation]] is the incorporation of inorganic carbon into organic matter. Unlike the surface of the planet where light is a major source of energy for carbon fixation, hydrothermal vent chemolithotrophic bacteria rely on chemical oxidation to obtain the energy required.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Fixation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is observed in members of [[Gammaproteobacteria|gammaproteobacterial]], [[epsilonproteobacteria]], [[alphaproteobacteria]], and members of [[Archaea]] domain at hydrothermal vents. Four major [[Metabolic pathway|metabolic pathways]] for carbon fixation found in microbial vent communities include the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle, reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle, 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) cycle and reductive acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) pathway.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakagawa|first=Satoshi|last2=Takai|first2=Ken|date=July 2008|title=Deep-sea vent chemoautotrophs: diversity, biochemistry and ecological significance|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18503548|journal=FEMS microbiology ecology|volume=65|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00502.x|issn=0168-6496|pmid=18503548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Carbon Fixation Metabolic Pathways =====
:'''Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (CBB)'''

::The [[Light-independent reactions|Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB)]] cycle is the most common CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation pathway found among autotrophs.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The key [[enzyme]] is ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase ([[RuBisCO]]).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[RuBisCO]] has been identified in members of the microbial community such as ''Thiomicrospira, [[Beggiatoa]]''[[Beggiatoa|,]] ''[[Zetaproteobacteria|zetaproteobacterium]]'', and [[Gammaproteobacteria|gammaproteobacterial]] [[Endosymbiont|endosymbionts]] of [[Tube worm|tubeworms]], [[Bivalvia|bivalves]], and [[Gastropoda|gastropods]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

:'''Reductive Carboxylic Acid Cycle (rTCA)'''

::The [[Reverse Krebs cycle|Reductive Carboxylic Acid Cycle (rTCA)]] is the second most commonly found carbon fixation pathway at hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cerqueira|first=Teresa|last2=Barroso|first2=Cristina|last3=Froufe|first3=Hugo|last4=Egas|first4=Conceição|last5=Bettencourt|first5=Raul|date=August 2018|title=Metagenomic Signatures of Microbial Communities in Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Sediments of Azores Vent Fields|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29354879|journal=Microbial Ecology|volume=76|issue=2|pages=387–403|doi=10.1007/s00248-018-1144-x|issn=1432-184X|pmid=29354879}}&lt;/ref&gt; rTCA cycle is essentially a reversed [[Citric acid cycle|TCA or Kreb cycle]] heterotrophs use to oxidize organic matter. Organism that use the rTCA cycle prefer to inhabit [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] zones in the hydrothermal vent system because some enzymes in the rTCA cycle are sensitive to the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It is found in sulfate reducing [[Deltaproteobacteria|deltaproteobacterium]] such as some members of ''[[Desulfobacterium|Desulfobacter]]'', ''[[Aquificae|Aquificales]]'' and ''[[Aquifex]]'' and ''[[Thermoproteales]]''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

:'''3-HP and 3-HP/4-HB cycles'''

::The key enzymes of [[3-HP and 3-HP/4-HB]] cycles are acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase, malonyl-CoA reductase and propionyl-CoA synthase. Most of the organisms that use this pathway are [[Mixotroph|mixotrophs]] with the ability to utilize organic carbon in addition to carbon fixation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

:'''Reductive Acetyl CoA pathway'''

::The [[Wood–Ljungdahl pathway|Reductive Acetyl CoA]] pathway has only been found in chemoautotrophs. This pathway does not require [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] as the pathway is directly coupled to the reduction of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Organisms that have been found with this pathway prefer H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rich areas. Species include deltaproteobacterium such as ''[[Dulfobacterium autotrophicum]],'' [[acetogen]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[Methanogen|methanogenic]] ''Archaea''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Methane Metabolism ====
Hydrothermal vents produce high quantities of [[methane]] which can originate from both geological and biological processes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;de Angelis, M. A. (1989). ''Studies of microbial methane oxidation in deep sea hydrothermal vent environments'' (Order No. 9020909). Available from ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global. (303750552). Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/303750552&lt;/ref&gt; Methane concentrations in hydrothermal vent plumes can exceed 300µM in concentration depending on the vent. In comparison, the vent fluid contains 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; times more methane than the surrounding deep ocean water, of which methane ranges between 0.2-0.3nM in concentration.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Microbial communities utilize the high concentrations of methane as an energy source and a source of carbon.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Methanotroph|Methanotrophy]], where a species uses methane both as an energy and carbon source, have been observed with the presence of [[gammaproteobacteria]] in the ''[[Methylococcaceae]]'' lineages.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Methanotrophs convert methane into carbon dioxide and organic carbon.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; They are typically characterized by the presence of intercellular membranes and microbes with intercellular membranes were observed to make up 20% of the [[microbial mat]] at hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===== Methane Oxidation =====
Energy generation via methane oxidation yields the next best source of energy after sulfur oxidation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It has been suggested that microbial oxidation facilitates rapid turnover at hydrothermal vents, thus much of the methane is oxidize within short distance of the vent.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In hydrothermal vent communities, aerobic oxidation of methane is commonly found in [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] microbes of vent animals.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=William|last2=Baross|first2=John|last3=Kelley|first3=Deborah|last4=Russell|first4=Michael J.|date=November 2008|title=Hydrothermal vents and the origin of life|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18820700|journal=Nature Reviews.

=== Sulfur Cycle ===
Refer to [[Sulfur cycle|Sulfur Cycle]]

Microbial communities at hydrothermal vent convert sulfur such as [[Sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] produced by geological activity into other forms such as [[sulfite]], [[sulfate]], and [[Sulfur|elemental sulfur]] for energy or [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] into [[Organic compound|organic molecules]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sulfide is plentiful at Hydrothermal Vents, with concentrations from one to tens of mM, whereas the surrounding ocean water usually only contains a few nano molars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radford-Knoery|first=Joël|last2=German|first2=C.

==== Sulfur Oxidation ====
Refer to [[Microbial oxidation of sulfur|Microbial Oxidation of Sulfur]]

Reduced sulfur compounds such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S produced by the hydrothermal vents are a major source of energy for sulfur metabolism in microbes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Redox|Oxidation]] of reduced sulfur compounds into forms such as [[sulfite]], [[thiosulfate]], and elemental sulfur is used to produce energy for microbe metabolism such as synthesis of [[Organic compound|organic compounds]] from [[Compounds of carbon|inorganic carbon]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The major metabolic pathways used for sulfur oxidation includes the [[Microbial oxidation of sulfur#%20Biochemistry|''SOX'' pathway]] and dissimilatory oxidation.

==== Sulfur Reduction ====
[[Dissimilatory sulfate reduction|Sulfur reduction]] uses sulfate as an electron acceptor for the [[Sulfur assimilation|assimilation of sulfur]]. Microbes that perform sulfate reduction typically use [[hydrogen]], [[methane]] or organic matter as an [[electron donor]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Anaerobic oxidation of methane]] (AOM) often use sulfate as electron acceptor.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This method is favoured by organisms living in highly [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] areas of the hydrothermal vent,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; thus are one of the predominate processes that occur within the sediments.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Species that reduce sulfate have been identified in [[Archaea]] and members of [[Deltaproteobacteria]] such as ''[[Desulfovibrio]], [[Desulfobulbus propionicus|Desulfobulbus]], [[Desulfobacteraceae|Desulfobacteria]], and [[Desulfuromonas]]'' at hydrothermal vents&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frank|first=Kiana L.|last2=Rogers|first2=Daniel R.|last3=Olins|first3=Heather C.|last4=Vidoudez|first4=Charles|last5=Girguis|first5=Peter R.|date=July 2013|title=Characterizing the distribution and rates of microbial sulfate reduction at Middle Valley hydrothermal vents|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23535916|journal=The ISME journal|volume=7|issue=7|pages=1391–1401|doi=10.1038/ismej.2013.17|issn=1751-7370|pmc=3695286|pmid=23535916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nitrogen Cycle  ===
Refer to [[Nitrogen cycle|Nitrogen Cycle]]

Deep ocean water contains the largest reservoir of [[nitrogen]] available to hydrothermal vents with around 0.59 mM of dissolved [[Nitrogen|Nitrogen gas]].&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mehta|first=Mausmi P.|last2=Butterfield|first2=David A.|last3=Baross|first3=John A.|date=February 2003|title=Phylogenetic diversity of nitrogenase (nifH) genes in deep-sea and hydrothermal vent environments of the Juan de Fuca Ridge|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12571018|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|volume=69|issue=2|pages=960–970|doi=10.1128/AEM.69.2.960-970.2003|issn=0099-2240|pmc=143675|pmid=12571018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourbonnais|first=Annie|last2=Lehmann|first2=Moritz F.|last3=Butterfield|first3=David A.|last4=Juniper|first4=S.

The study of the [[Nitrogen cycle|Nitrogen Cycle]] in hydrothermal vent microbial communities still requires more comprehensive research.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; However, [[isotope]] data suggests that microorganism influence dissolved inorganic nitrogen quantities and compositions and all pathways of the nitrogen cycle are likely to be found at hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Biological [[nitrogen fixation]] is important to provide some of the biologically available nitrogen to the nitrogen cycle especially at unsedimented hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Nitrogen fixation is done by many different microbes including [[methanogen]] in the orders ''[[Methanomicrobiales]]'', ''[[Methanococcales]]'', and ''[[Methanobacteriales]]''&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;''.'' [[Thermophile|Thermophilic]] microbes have been found to be able to fix nitrogen at higher temperatures such as 92°C.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Nitrogen fixation may be especially prevalent in [[Microbial mat|microbial mats]] and [[Pelagic sediment|particulate material]] where biologically available levels of nitrogen are low, due to high microbe density and anaerobic environment allows the function of [[nitrogenase]], a nitrogen fixing enzyme.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Evidence have also been detected of [[Nitrogen assimilation|assimilation]], [[nitrification]], [[denitrification]], [[Anammox|anamox]], [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] and [[dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium]].&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; For example, [[sulfur oxidizing bacteria]] like ''Begiatoa'' species, perform denitrification and reduces nitrate to oxidize H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Nitrate assimilation is done by symbiotic species of [[Riftia pachyptila|''Riftia pachyptil''a]] tubeworm&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== Bacterial Diversity ==
The most abundant bacteria in hydrothermal vents are chemolithotrophs. These bacteria use reduced chemical species, most often sulfur, as sources of energy to reduce carbon dioxide to organic carbon.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jannasch|first=Holger W.|last2=Mottl|first2=Michael J.|date=1985|title=Geomicrobiology of Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vents|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1696097|journal=Science|volume=229|issue=4715|pages=717–725}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemolithotrophic abundance in a hydrothermal vent environment is determined by the available energy sources; different temperature vents have different concentrations of nutrients, suggesting large variation between vents. In general, large microbial populations are found in warm vent water plumes (25°C), the surfaces exposed to warm vent plumes and in symbiotic tissues within certain vent invertebrates in the vicinity of the vent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Sulfur-oxidizing ===
These bacteria use various forms of available sulfur (S&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, S&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the presence of oxygen. They are the predominant population in the majority of hydrothermal vents because their source of energy is widely available, and chemosynthesis rates increase in aerobic conditions. The bacteria at hydrothermal vents are similar to the types of sulfur bacteria found in other H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-rich environments - except ''Thiomicrospira'' has replaced ''Thiobacillus.'' Other common species are ''Thiothrix'' and ''Beggiatoa,'' which is of particular importance because of its ability to fix nitrogen.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Methane-oxidizing ===
Methane is a substantial source of energy in certain hydrothermal vents, but not others: methane is more abundant in warm vents (25°C) than hydrogen.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Many types of methanotrophic bacteria exist, which require oxygen and fix CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and other C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; compounds, including CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO, if present in vent water.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These type of bacteria are also found in ''[[Riftia pachyptila|Riftia]]'' trophosome, indicating a symbiotic relationship.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Here, methane-oxidizing bacteria refers to [[Methanotroph|methanotrophs]], which are not the same as [[Methanogen|methanogens]]: ''[[Methanococcus]]'' and ''[[Methanocaldococcus jannaschii]]'' are examples methanogens,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; which are found in hydrothermal vents; whereas ''[[Methylocystaceae]]'' are methanotrophs, which have been discovered in hydrothermal vent communities as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skennerton|first=Connor T.|last2=Ward|first2=Lewis M.|last3=Michel|first3=Alice|last4=Metcalfe|first4=Kyle|last5=Valiente|first5=Chanel|last6=Mullin|first6=Sean|last7=Chan|first7=Ken Y.|last8=Gradinaru|first8=Viviana|last9=Orphan|first9=Victoria J.|date=2015|title=Genomic Reconstruction of an Uncultured Hydrothermal Vent Gammaproteobacterial Methanotroph (Family Methylothermaceae) Indicates Multiple Adaptations to Oxygen Limitation|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01425/full|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|language=English|volume=6|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.01425|issn=1664-302X|pmc=4688376|pmid=26779119}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Hydrogen-oxidizing ===
Little is known about microbes that use hydrogen as a source of energy, however, studies have shown that they are aerobic, and also symbiotic with ''Riftia'' (see below).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These bacteria are important in the primary production of organic carbon because the geothermally-produced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is taken up for this process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Hydrogen-oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria may be abundant in vents where NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;-containing bottom seawater mixes with hydrothermal fluid.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''Desulfonauticus submarinus'' is a [[hydrogenotroph]] that reduces sulfur-compounds in warm vents and has been found in tube worms ''R. pachyptila'' and ''Alvinella pompejana.'' &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Audiffrin|first=Carine|last2=Cayol|first2=Jean-Luc|last3=Joulian|first3=Catherine|last4=Casalot|first4=Laurence|last5=Thomas|first5=Pierre|last6=Garcia|first6=Jean-Louis|last7=Ollivier|first7=Bernard|date=2003|title=Desulfonauticus submarinus gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel sulfate-reducing bacterium isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent|url=http://ijs.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijs.0.02551-0|journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology|volume=53|issue=5|pages=1585–1590|doi=10.1099/ijs.0.02551-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iron- and manganese-oxidizing ===
These bacteria are commonly found in iron and manganese deposits on surfaces exposed intermittently to plumes of hydrothermal and bottom seawater. However, due to the rapid oxidation of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in neutral and alkaline waters (i.e. freshwater and seawater), bacteria responsible for the oxidative deposition of iron would be more commonly found in acidic waters.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Manganese-oxidizing bacteria would be more abundant in freshwater and seawater compared to iron-oxidizing bacteria due to the higher concentration of available metal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Symbiotic Relationships ====
[[Symbiosis|Symbiotic]] [[chemosynthesis]] is an important process for hydrothermal vent communities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; At warm vents, common symbionts for bacteria are deep-sea clams, ''[[Calyptogena magnifica|Calpytogena magnifica]],'' mussels such as ''[[Bathymodiolus thermophilus|Bathyomodiolus thermophilus]]'' and pogonophoran tube worms, ''[[Riftia pachyptila]]'', and ''[[Alvinella pompejana]]''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Hydrothermal_vents|title=Hydrothermal vents - microbewiki|website=microbewiki.kenyon.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;The [[trophosome]] of these animals are specified organs for symbionts that contains valuable molecules for chemosynthesis. These organisms have become so reliant on their symbionts that they have lost all morphological features relating to ingestion and digestion, though the bacteria are provided with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and free O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, methane-oxidizing bacteria have been isolated from ''C. magnifica'' and ''R. pachyptila,'' which indicate that methane assimilation may take place within the trophosome of these organisms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The high number-density of viruses and therefore viral production (in comparison to surrounding deep-sea waters) implies that viruses are a significant source of microbial mortality at the vents.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Like in other marine environments, deep-sea hydrothermal viruses affect abundance and diversity of [[Prokaryote|prokaryotes]] and therefore impact microbial biogeochemical cycling by [[Lysis|lysing]] their hosts to replicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breitbart|first=Mya|date=2012-01-15|title=Marine Viruses: Truth or Dare|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-marine-120709-142805|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=425–448|doi=10.1146/annurev-marine-120709-142805|issn=1941-1405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in contrast to their role as a source of mortality and population control, viruses have also been postulated to enhance survival of prokaryotes in extreme environments, acting as reservoirs of genetic information. The interactions of the virosphere with microorganisms under environmental stresses is therefore thought to aide microorganism survival through dispersal of host genes through [[Horizontal gene transfer in evolution|Horizontal Gene Transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldenfeld|first=Nigel|last2=Woese|first2=Carl|date=January 2007|title=Biology's next revolution|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/445369a|journal=Nature|volume=445|issue=7126|pages=369–369|doi=10.1038/445369a|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“There's roughly [[Avogadro’s number]] of infections going on in the ocean, and every one of those interactions can result in the transfer of genetic information between virus and host” — Curtis Suttle&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14575-new-viral-way-of-life-discovered-in-deep-sea-vents/|title=New viral way of life discovered in deep-sea vents|last=Callaway|first=Ewen|work=New Scientist|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Temperate phage|Temperate phages]] (those not causing immediate lysis) can sometimes confer [[Phenotype|phenotypes]] that improve fitness in prokaryotes &lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; The [[Lysogenic cycle|lysogenic]] life-cycle can persist stably for thousands of generations of infected bacteria and the viruses can alter the host's phenotype by enabling genes (a process known as [[lysogenic conversion]]) which can therefore allow hosts to cope with different environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clokie|first=Martha R.J.|last2=Millard|first2=Andrew D.|last3=Letarov|first3=Andrey V.|last4=Heaphy|first4=Shaun|date=January 2011|title=Phages in nature|url=https://doi.org/10.4161/bact.1.1.14942|journal=Bacteriophage|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=31–45|doi=10.4161/bact.1.1.14942|issn=2159-7081|pmc=3109452|pmid=21687533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits to the host population can also be conferred by expression of phage-encoded fitness-enhancing phenotypes.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Shannon J|last2=Cary|first2=S Craig|last3=Williamson|first3=Kurt E|last4=Helton|first4=Rebekah R|last5=Bench|first5=Shellie R|last6=Winget|first6=Danielle|last7=Wommack|first7=K Eric|date=2008-08-21|title=Lysogenic virus–host interactions predominate at deep-sea diffuse-flow hydrothermal vents|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej200873|journal=The ISME Journal|language=En|volume=2|issue=11|pages=1112–1121|doi=10.1038/ismej.2008.73|issn=1751-7362}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lysogentic cycle diagram.svg|thumb|Lysogenic Cycle: 1. The prokaryotic cell is shown with its DNA, in green. 2. The bacteriophage attaches and releases its DNA, shown in red, into the prokaryotic cell. 3. The phage DNA then moves through the cell to the host's DNA. 4. The phage DNA integrates itself into the host cell's DNA, creating prophage. 5. The prophage then remains dormant until the host cell divides. 6. After the host cell has duplicated, the phage DNA in the daughter cells activate, and the phage DNA begins to express itself. Some of the cells containing the prophage go on to create new phages which will move on to infect other cells.]]
A review of viral work at hydrothermal vents published in 2015 stated that vents harbour a significant proportion of lysogenic hosts and that a large proportion of viruses are temperate indicating that the vent environments may provide an advantage to the prophage.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272147017_Viral_evolution_at_the_limits|title=(PDF) Viral evolution at the limits|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study of virus-host interactions in diffuse-flow hydrothermal vent environments found that the high-incidence of lysogenic hosts and large populations of temperate viruses was unique in its magnitude and that these viruses are likely critical to the systems ecology of prokaryotes. The same study's genetic analysis found that 51% of the viral [[Metagenomics|metagenome]] sequences were unknown (lacking [[Homology (biology)|homology]] to sequenced data), with high diversity across vent environments but lower diversity for specific vent sites which indicates high specificity for viral targets.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; 

A metagenomic analysis of deep-sea hydrothermal vent [[Virome|viromes]] showed that viral genes manipulated bacterial [[metabolism]], participating in metabolic pathways as well as forming branched pathways in microbial metabolism which facilitated adaptation to the extreme environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=He|first=Tianliang|last2=Li|first2=Hongyun|last3=Zhang|first3=Xiaobo|date=2017-09-06|title=Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vent Viruses Compensate for Microbial Metabolism in Virus-Host Interactions|url=https://mbio.asm.org/content/8/4/e00893-17|journal=mBio|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=e00893–17|doi=10.1128/mBio.00893-17|issn=2150-7511|pmc=5513705|pmid=28698277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this was associated with the sulfur-consuming bacterium SUP05. A study found that 15 of 18 viral genomes sequenced from samples of vent plumes contained genes closely related to an enzyme that the SUP05 [[Chemolithoautotroph|chemolithoautotrophs]] use to extract energy from sulfur compounds. The authors concluded that such phage genes ([[auxiliary metabolic genes]]) that are able to enhance the sulfur oxidation metabolism in their hosts could provide selective advantages to viruses (continued infection and replication).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anantharaman|first=Karthik|last2=Duhaime|first2=Melissa B.|last3=Breier|first3=John A.|last4=Wendt|first4=Kathleen A.|last5=Toner|first5=Brandy M.|last6=Dick|first6=Gregory J.|date=2014-05-16|title=Sulfur Oxidation Genes in Diverse Deep-Sea Viruses|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6185/757|journal=Science|language=en|volume=344|issue=6185|pages=757–760|doi=10.1126/science.1252229|issn=0036-8075|pmid=24789974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity in viral and SUP05 genes for the sulfur metabolism implies an exchange of genes in the past and could implicate the viruses as agents of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2014/05/02/3996620.htm|title=Viruses make zombies of deep sea vent bacteria|date=2014-05-02|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another metagenomic study found that viral genes had relatively high proportion of metabolism, [[Vitamin|vitamins]] and [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] genes, indicating that viral genomes encode auxiliary metabolic genes. Coupled with the observations of a high proportion of lysogenic viruses, this indicates that viruses are selected to be integrated [[Provirus|pro-viruses]] rather than free floating viruses and that the auxiliary genes can be expressed to benefit both the host and the integrated virus. The viruses enhance fitness by boosting metabolism or offering greater metabolic flexibility to the hosts they’re within. The evidence suggests that deep-sea hydrothermal vent viral evolutionary strategies promote prolonged host integration, favoring a form of mutualism to classic parasitism.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

As hydrothermal vents outlets for sub-seafloor material, there is also likely a connection between vent viruses and those in the crust.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8181">'''Johann Jakob Griesbach''' (4 January 1745 – 24 March 1812), German biblical [[textual critic]], was born at [[Butzbach]], a small town in the state of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], where his father, Konrad Kaspar (1705–1777), was pastor. Griesbach's fame rests upon his work in [[New Testament]] criticism, in which he inaugurated a new epoch. His solution to the [[synoptic problem]] bears his name, but the [[Griesbach hypothesis]] has been modernly referred to as the [[Two-Gospel hypothesis]].
[[File:Griesbach1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Johann Jakob Griesbach]]

==Education and career==
Griesbach was educated at [[Frankfurt]], and at the universities of [[university of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [[university of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[university of Halle|Halle]], where he became one of [[Johann Salomo Semler|J. S. Semler]]'s most ardent disciples. It was Semler who induced him to turn his attention to the textual criticism of the New Testament. At the close of his undergraduate career he undertook a literary tour through Germany, the Netherlands, France and England. In England he may have met [[Henry Owen]] whose seminal work ''Observations on the Four Gospels'' (1764) is listed among the books of Griesbach's estate, although he does not seem to have acknowledged any indebtedness to Owen.

On his return to Halle, Griesbach acted for some time as ''Privatdozent'', but in 1773 was appointed to a professorial chair; in 1775 he went to the [[Friedrich Schiller University of Jena|University of Jena]], where he spent the rest of his life (though he received calls to other universities).

==New Testament text critic==
[[File:Johann Jacob Griesbach.jpg|thumb]]
Griesbach's critical edition of the [[New Testament]] first appeared at Halle, in three volumes, in 1774-1775. The first volume contained the first three Gospels, synoptically arranged; the second, the [[Epistles]] and the [[book of Revelation]]. All the historical books were reprinted in one volume in 1777, the synoptical arrangement of the Gospels having been abandoned as inconvenient. Of the second edition, considerably enlarged and improved, the first volume appeared in 1796 and the second in 1806 (Halle and London). Of a third edition, edited by David Schulz, only the first volume, containing the four Gospels, appeared (1827).

For the construction of his critical text Griesbach took as his basis the [[House of Elzevir|''Elzevir'']] edition. Where he differed from it he placed the ''Elzevir'' reading on the inner margin along with other readings he thought worthy of special consideration (these last, however, being printed in smaller type). To all the readings on this margin he attached special marks indicating the precise degree of probability in his opinion attaching to each. In weighing these probabilities he proceeded upon a particular theory which in its leading features he had derived from [[Johann Albrecht Bengel|J. A. Bengel]] and J. S. Semler, dividing all the manuscripts into three main groups – the [[Alexandria]]n, the Western and the [[Byzantium|Byzantine]].

A reading supported by only one [[recension]] he considered as having only one witness in its favour; those readings which were supported by all the three recensions, or even by two of them, especially if these two were the Alexandrian and the Western, he unhesitatingly accepted as genuine. Only when each of the three recensions gives a different reading does he proceed to discuss the question on other grounds.

See his ''Symbolae criticae ad supplendas et corrigendas variarum N. T. lectionum collectiones'' (Halle, 1785, 1793), and his ''Commentarius criticus in textum Graecum N. T.'', which extends to the end of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and discusses the more important various readings with great care and thoroughness (Jena, 1794 if.).

Among the other works of Griesbach (which are comparatively unimportant) may be mentioned his university thesis ''De codicibus quatuor evangelislarum Origenianis'' (Halle, 1771) and a work upon [[systematic theology]] (''Anleitung zur Kenntniss der populären Dogmatik'', Jena, 1779). His ''Opuscula'', consisting chiefly of university "Programs" and addresses, were edited by [[Johann Philipp Gabler|Gabler]] (2 vols, Jena, 1824).

==Gospel Synopsis==
In 1776 Griesbach published his Greek Gospel synopsis of Matthew, Mark and Luke as a volume separate from his critical edition of the New Testament (cf. above), of which it had previously been a part, and thereby established the tool of a synopsis as an essential research aid in New Testament studies.

For Griesbach's hypothesis concerning the interrelation of the Gospel accounts of Matthew, Mark and Luke, and its modern variant, see [[Griesbach hypothesis]].

==Johann Jakob Griesbach Bicentenary Colloquium 1776-1976==
To mark the bicentenary of the publication of Griesbach's Gospel synopsis as a separate volume a group of distinguished international biblical scholars met in July 1976 at Münster/Westphalia for ''The Johann Jakob Griesbach Bicentenary Colloquium 1776-1976''.

A selection of the papers presented at the colloquium appraising Griesbach's life, work and influence, aimed "to indicate why an understanding of this scholar's contribution to New Testament criticism is important both for the history of New Testament scholarship and for contemporary research", together with the text in Latin and in English translation of ''The Dissertation of J. J. Griesbach, Doctor of Theology and Principal Professor in the University of Jena, in which he demonstrates that the entire Gospel of Mark has been extracted from the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, written in the name of the University of Jena (1789–1790), now revised and furnished with many additions'', are to be found in [[Bernard Orchard]] and [[Thomas R. W. Longstaff]] (ed.), ''J. J. Griesbach: Synoptic and Text-Critical Studies 1776-1976'', Volume 34 in the SNTS Monograph Series (Cambridge University Press, hardback 1978, paperback 2005 {{ISBN|0-521-02055-7}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13274">A '''KWL table''', or '''KWL chart''', is a [[Graphic organizers|graphical organizer]] designed to help in [[learning]]. The letters KWL are an [[acronym]], for what students, in the course of a lesson, already '''k'''now, '''w'''ant to know, and ultimately '''l'''earn. It is a part of the [[Constructivist methods|constructivist teaching method]] where students move away from what are considered traditional methods of teaching and learning. In this particular methodology the students are given the space to learn by constructing their own learning pace and their own style of understanding a given topic or idea. The KWL chart or table was developed within this methodology and is a form of instructional reading strategy that is used to guide students taking them through the idea and the text.&lt;ref name="nea.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/tools/k-w-l-know-want-to-know-learned.html|title=NEA - K-W-L (Know, Want to Know, Learned)|work=NEA|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A KWL table is typically divided into three columns titled [[declarative knowledge|Know]], Want and Learned. The table comes in various forms as some have modified it to include or exclude information.

It may be useful in research projects and to organize information to help study for tests.

==Classroom introduction==
The KWL chart was created by Donna Ogle in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Ogle, D.M. (1986). K-W-L: A teaching model that develops active reading of expository text. ''Reading Teacher'', 39, 564–570&lt;/ref&gt; A KWL chart can be used for all subjects in a whole group or small group atmosphere. The chart is a comprehension strategy used to activate background knowledge prior to reading and is completely student centered.  The teacher divides a piece of chart paper into three columns.  The first column, 'K', is for what the students already know about a topic.  This step is to be completed before the reading.  The next column, 'W', is for students to list what they want to learn about the topic during the reading.  This step is also to be completed before the reading.  The third column, 'L', is for what the students learned from the reading.  This step, of course, is done after finishing the reading. The KWL chart can also be used in reading instruction at the beginning of a new unit.

Here is what the KWL chart can look like: 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! K 
What I ''know''
! W 
What I ''want'' to know
! L 
What I ''learned
|-
| Write the information about what the students know in this space. 
| Write the information about what the students want to know in this space. 
| After the completion of the lesson or unit, write the information that the students learned in this space. 
|-
|}

=== Things to keep in mind ===

Materials required can vary on the type of classroom activity the teacher intends to carry. For a classroom activity if the teacher divides the class for a particular topic then 1 paper with KWL chart per group shall be given. But if the teacher wants every individual child to brainstorm on the given topic then every individual shall have their own student paper copy.&lt;ref name="msu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://msu.edu/course/cep/886/Reading%20Comprehension/7Learn_Serv_Proj_KWL.html|title=K-W-L STRATEGY|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 'K' column, the teacher has to make sure that she or he has all the questions ready for the students to brainstorm on the particular idea that needs to be taken care in that class. The questions help the students to be prompted to think in specific directions that will lead them to the first step of brainstorming. Also ask the students the reason of their answers. By this the teacher makes them aware of their associations to the answers. The questions like "what made you think like that?" shall guide them well.
In the 'W' column, ask associating questions or liking questions to make them come to the thinking. questions like, "what would you like to learn more about this idea?" can help them to analyze and think more. The teacher here has to come prepared with her/his own set of questions that will link the students' questions to the idea in the text. This is done so that the student shall not lose the flow of the text as well as not lose the purpose of the activity.
In the last column 'L', help the students to come out with their own creative ideas and analysis. Also in this particular column, the teacher shall ask the students to differentiate between the answers to their questions and ideas in other columns and the idea they found interesting. At last, the teacher shall help the students to consult other sources which would answer their questions which are not mentioned in the text.&lt;ref name="nea.org"/&gt;

A KWL chart can be used to drive instruction in the classroom. The teacher can create lesson plans based upon the interests and inquiries of the students and their needs. Using this strategy can increase motivation and attention by activating the students' prior knowledge. This allows the teacher to understand the students' prior knowledge and the students' interests in the topic.

==Purpose==
A teacher has many reasons for using KWL charts in the classroom. First, a KWL chart activates students' prior knowledge of the text or topic to be studied. By asking students what they already know, students are thinking about prior experiences or knowledge about the topic. Next, KWL charts set a purpose for the unit. Students are able to add their input to the topic by asking them what they want to know. Students then have a purpose for participating and engaging in the topic. Also, using a KWL chart allows students to expand their ideas beyond the text used in the classroom. By being aware of students' interests, the teacher has the ability to create projects and assignments that the students will enjoy. A KWL chart is a tool that can be used to drive instruction as well as guide student learning.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;KWL table/ chart. (2009). Retrieved October 26, 2012, from http://www.study-habits.com/kwl-table-chart&lt;/ref&gt; 
KWL charts are used by elementary teachers from literature to science. They are also used to teach historical content at the elementary level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachinghistory.org/teaching-materials/teaching-guides/21806|title=Applying KWL Guides to Sources with Elementary Students|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Study tool ===
A KWL chart can be used as a study tool for an individual, group or entire class.  It is a way to synthesize information into a visual aid.  The students are also able to keep track of what they have done and what they still would like, or need to do.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Required materials ===
Materials required can vary on the type of classroom activity the teacher intends to carry. For a classroom activity if the teacher divides the class for a particular topic then one paper with KWL chart per group shall be given. But if the teacher wants every individual child to brainstorm on the given topic then every individual shall have their own student paper copy.&lt;ref name="msu.edu"/&gt;

=== Specific learners ===
KWL charts can be used with all students, however there are specific groups of students that lend themselves quite well to this strategy, including visual learners, young learners or [[ESL]] learners.  As the chart is a [[graphic organizer]] it can aid visual learners.  The information is presented in a user friendly way that is visually accessible.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;McDermott, M. J. (2012). Using graphic organizers in preschool. Teaching Young Children, 5(5), 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the visual nature of the KWL chart it can also be beneficial for young learners such as preschoolers.  Words may not be necessary and pictures can be used in order to express the ideas within the chart.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  As pictures can be used alone or in conjunction with words the KWL chart may provide assistance for students that are learning a second language.

== Adaptations ==
There are various adaptations of KWL charts that can be used within the classroom.

=== Hill ===
One adaptation as created by Hill&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Instructional strategies online. (2009). Retrieved October 26, 2012, from http://olc.spsd.sk.ca/DE/PD/instr/strats/kwl/&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension of the traditional KWL chart to include a column for "Further Wanderings" at the end of the table.  This allows for the students' knowledge to continue beyond what they have learned within the classroom. The idea behind this extra column is to encourage the students to continue to learn.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

=== KLEW ===
Another adaptation of the KWL chart is the KLEW chart.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Hershberger, K., Zembal-Saul, C., &amp; Starr, M. L. (2006). Evidence helps the KWL get a KLEW. Science &amp; Children, 43(5), 50–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  The KLEW chart was developed by a group of people with various backgrounds including an elementary school teacher, a professor and a professional development specialist.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Within this chart, the "K" stands for what students know of a topic, the "L" for what is being learned, the "E" for evidence that supports the learning previously described, and the "W" for wondering, which leaves room for further questions.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; This table differs from the traditional KWL chart as it places an emphasis on observation and examination of evidence that supports what they see.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

=== Mooney ===
Margaret Mooney suggested a variation to the KWL chart by adding a fifth column to the traditional chart. This column would be located between the "W" and the "L". Its purpose is to answer the question "How".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; This encourages the students to develop their own means of how they will discover more information. This can be quite useful in the sciences for experimentation purposes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== Assessment and evaluation ==
The KWL chart is useful to complete [[formative assessment]] in the classroom.  It allows the teacher to find out the students prior knowledge on a particular topic.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Struble, J. (2007). Using graphic organizers as formative assessment. Science Scope, 30(5), 69-71.&lt;/ref&gt;  From this knowledge the teacher is then able to gear their lessons based upon this information. The KWL chart can be completed when starting a new topic and be added to throughout the unit.  Further, the teacher is able to find out what the students have learned by the end of their lessons.

KWL charts work well in order to examine the individual student or the entire class in order to understand their thinking and learning.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

=== Advantages ===
According to Jared and Jared (1997), KWL was established with the motive to enhance the comprehensive reading skills of the students. This was done by designing the three levels of the activity focusing on the different learning styles of the individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Jared, J. Elizabeth, Jared, H. Alva (1997). Launching into improved comprehension. ''The Technology Teacher'', 56(6), 24–31.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Glazer(1998), students fail to enjoy the text or content because they fail to understand it. Hence, KWL increases their comprehension skills as the activity goes through each topic step by step.&lt;ref&gt;Glazer, M. Susan. (1998). Using kwl folders. Teaching Diverse Learners, 29(4), 106-107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan. (1998). Using kwl folders. Teaching Diverse Learners, 29(4), 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Szabo(2006), a KWL table uses a strategy of before-during-after for the students to enhance their comprehension skills. The students start by brainstorming the prior knowledge about the topic and then eventually develop curiosity about the topic. This builds their interest in the topic and they would want to learn more about the topic. KWL chart gives an opportunity to the individual to build up self-motivation regarding the topic. Through KWL table, the students go through self-evaluation as they know what they intend to learn and what they really understood. Hence, KWL gives the students some space to explore the topic through other sources and build up their knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, Susan. (2006). Kwhhl: A student-driven evolution of the kwl. ''American Secondary Education'', 34(3), 57–67&lt;/ref&gt;

== UN-OHRLLS ==
{{main|UN-OHRLLS}}

The [[United Nations]] has an Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS). It mainly holds the view that high transport costs due to distance and terrain result in the erosion of competitive edge for exports from landlocked countries.&lt;ref name="UN-OHRLLS. 2005"&gt;UN-OHRLLS. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it recognizes the constraints on landlocked countries to be mainly physical, including lack of direct access to the sea, isolation from world markets and high transit costs due to physical distance.&lt;ref name="UN-OHRLLS. 2005"/&gt; It also attributes geographic remoteness as one of the most significant reasons why developing landlocked nations cannot alleviate{{clarify|date=March 2017}} themselves, while European landlocked cases are mostly developed because of short distances to the sea through well-developed countries.&lt;ref name="UN-OHRLLS. 2005"/&gt; One other commonly cited factor is the administrative burdens associated with border crossings as there is a heavy load of bureaucratic procedures, paperwork, custom charges, and most importantly, traffic delay due to border wait times, which affect delivery contracts.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 47"&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Delays and inefficiency compound geographically, where a 2 to 3 week wait due to border customs between [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]] makes it impossible to book ships ahead of time in [[Mombasa]], furthering delivery contract delays.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these explanations, it is also important to consider the transit countries that neighbour LLDCs, from whose ports the goods of LLDCs are exported.

==Dependency problems==
Although [[Adam Smith]] and traditional thought hold that geography and transportation are the culprits for keeping LLDCs from realizing development gains, Faye, Sachs and Snow hold the argument that no matter the advancement of infrastructure or lack of geographic distance to a port, landlocked nations are still dependent on their neighbouring transit nations.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Outlying this specific relationship of dependency, Faye et al. insist that though LLDCs vary across the board in terms of HDI index scores, LLDCs almost uniformly straddle at the bottom of HDI rankings in terms of region, suggesting a correlated dependency relationship of development for landlocked countries with their respective regions.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 39"&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, HDI levels decrease as one moves inland along the major transit route that runs from the coast of Kenya, across the country before going through Uganda, [[Rwanda]] and then finally [[Burundi]].&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 39"/&gt; Just recently, it has been economically modeled that if the economic size of a transit country is increased by just 1%, a subsequent increase of at least 2% is experienced by the landlocked country, which shows that there is hope for LLDCs if the conditions of their transit neighbours are addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Paudel. 2012, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some LLDCs are seeing the brighter side of such a relationship, with the Central Asian nations geographic location between three [[BRIC]] nations (China, [[Russia]] and [[India]]) hungry for the region's oil and mineral wealth serving to boost economic development.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 76"&gt;Fara. 2012, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The three major factors that LLDCs are dependent on their transit neighbours are dependence on transit infrastructure, dependence on political relations with neighbours, and dependence on internal peace and stability within transit neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burundi===
[[File:Map displaying landlocked Burundi's strife with finding a suitable export route.png|thumb|400px| Burundi is shown in blue. Its possible export routes were:

* dependent on infrastructure of transit neighbour Tanzania (yellow), or

&lt;br&gt;* dependent on political relations with transit neighbour Kenya (orange), or 
* dependent on internal stability of transit neighbour Mozambique (red).
When all three routes were unavailable, Burundi had to rely on the port of Durban in South Africa (brown).]]
Burundi has relatively good internal road networks, but it cannot export its goods using the most direct route to the sea since the inland infrastructure of [[Tanzania]] is poorly connected to the port of [[Dar es Salaam]].&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Burundi relies on Kenya's port of Mombasa for export; but this route was severed briefly in the 1990s when political relations with Kenya deteriorated.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"/&gt; Further, Burundi's exports could not pass through [[Mozambique]] around the same time due to violent civil conflict.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 47"/&gt; Thus, Burundi had to export its goods using a 4500&amp;nbsp;km route, crossing several borders and changing transport modes, to reach the port of [[Durban]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"/&gt;

===Other African countries===

* [[Mali]] had problems exporting goods in the 1990s as nearly all its transit neighbours ([[Algeria]], [[Togo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Guinea]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]]) were engaged in civil war around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; The exception being Ghana which was under a military rule but did not have an active civil war
* The [[Central African Republic]]'s export routes are seasonal: in the rainy season Cameroon's roads are too poor to use; and during the dry season the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]'s [[Oubangui River]] water levels are too low for river travel.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"/&gt;

===Central Asia===

The mineral resource-rich countries of [[Central Asia]] and [[Mongolia]] offer a unique set of landlocked cases to explore in more depth, as these are nations where economic growth has grown exceptionally in recent years.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 76"/&gt; In Central Asia, oil and coal deposits have influenced development: [[Kazakhstan]]’s GDI per capita in purchasing power parity was five times greater than [[Kyrgyzstan]]'s in 2009.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 76"/&gt; Despite substantial development growth, these nations are not on a stable and destined path to being well developed, as the exploitation of their natural resources translates into an overall low average income and disparity of income, and because their limited deposits of resources allow growth only in the short term, and most importantly because dependence on unprocessed materials increases the risk of shocks due to variations in market prices.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 77"&gt;Fara. 2012, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; And though it is widely conceived that free trade can permit faster economic growth,&lt;ref&gt;Paudel. 2012, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Mongolia is now subjected to a new geopolitical game about the traffic on its railway lines between China and Russia.&lt;ref name="Bulag. 2009, p. 100"&gt;Bulag. 2009, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian Railways]] now effectively owns 50% of Mongolia's rail infrastructure, which could mean more efficient modernization and the laying of new rail lines, but in reality also translates into powerful leverage to pressure the government of Mongolia to concede unfair terms for license grants of coal, copper, and gold mines.&lt;ref&gt;Bulag. 2009, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it can be argued that these nations with extraordinary mineral wealth should pursue economic diversification.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 77"/&gt; All of these nations possess education qualifications, as they are inheritors of the [[Soviet Union]]'s social education system. This implies that it is due to poor economic policies that more than 40% of the labour force is bogged down in the agricultural sector instead of being diverted into secondary or tertiary economic activity.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 77"/&gt; Yet, it cannot be ignored that Mongolia benefits exceptionally from its proximity to two giant BRIC nations, resulting in a rapid development of railway ports along its borders, especially along the Chinese border, as the Chinese seek to direct coking coal from Mongolia to China's northwestern industrial core as well as for transportation to [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], resulting in revenue generation through the port of [[Tianjin]].&lt;ref name="Bulag. 2009, p. 100"/&gt;

===Nepal===
[[Nepal]] is another landlocked country with extreme dependency on its transit neighbour India. India does not have poor relations with Nepal, nor does it lack relevant transport infrastructure or internal stability. In the 1970s, Nepal suffered from large commodity concentration and a high geographic centralization in its export trade: over 98% of its exports were to India, and 90% of its imports came from India.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1114.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of all this, Nepal had a poor trade bargaining position.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"/&gt; In the 1950s, Nepal was forced to comply with India's external tariffs as well as the prices of India's exports.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"/&gt; This was problematic since the two countries have different levels of development, resulting in greater gains for India which was larger, more advanced and with more resources.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"/&gt; It was feared that a parasitic relationship might emerge, since India had a head start in industrialization, and dominated Nepal in manufacturing, which could reduce Nepal to being just a supplier of raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1116-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these problems, and Nepal's inability to develop its own infant industries (as it could not compete with Indian manufactures)&lt;ref&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1117.&lt;/ref&gt; treaties were drafted in 1960 and 1971, with amendments to the equal tariffs conditions, and terms of trade have since progressed.&lt;ref&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Almaty Ministerial Conference==
In August, 2003, the International Ministerial Conference of Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries on Transit Transport Cooperation (Almaty Ministerial Conference) was held in [[Almaty]], Kazakhstan, setting the necessities of LLDCs in a universal document whereas there were no coordinated efforts on the global scale to serve the unique needs of LLDCs in the past.&lt;ref name="Hagen. 2003, p. 13"/&gt; Other than acknowledging the main forms of dependency that must be addressed, it also acknowledged the additional dependency issue where neighbouring transit countries are often observed to export the same products as their landlocked neighbours.&lt;ref name="Hagen. 2003, p. 13"/&gt; One result of the conference was a direct call for donor countries to step in to direct aid into setting up suitable infrastructure of transit countries to alleviate the burden of supporting LLDCs in regions of poor development in general.&lt;ref name="Hagen. 2003, p. 13"/&gt; The general objectives of the Almaty Program of Action is as follows:
*Reduce customs processes and fees to minimize costs and transport delays
*Improve infrastructure with respect to existing preferences of local transport modes, where road should be focused in Africa and rail in South Asia
*Implement preferences for landlocked countries’ commodities to boost their competitiveness in the international market
*To establish relationships between donor countries with landlocked and transit countries for technical, financial and policy improvements&lt;ref&gt;UN-OHRLLS. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linnaeus' flower clock''' was a garden plan hypothesized by [[Carl Linnaeus]] that would take advantage of several plants that open or close their flowers at particular times of the day to accurately indicate the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Linnaeus’ Floral Clock. |author=Anonymous |date=March 2013 (acc.

He proposed the concept in his 1751 publication ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]'', calling it the ''Horologium Florae'' (lit. "''flower clock''").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Philosophia Botanica, section 335. |author=C Linnaeus |date=1751 (acc.

Cadell Publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may never have planted such a garden, but the idea was attempted by several [[botanical garden]]s in the early 19th century, with mixed success. Many plants exhibit a strong [[circadian rhythm]] (see also [[Chronobiology]]), and a few have been observed to open at quite a regular time, but the accuracy of such a clock is diminished because flowering time is affected by weather and seasonal effects. The flowering times recorded by Linnaeus are also subject to differences in daylight due to [[latitude]]: his measurements are based on flowering times in [[Uppsala]], where he taught and had received his university education.

Some 30 years before Linnaeus' birth, such a floral clock may have been described by [[Andrew Marvell]], in his poem "[[The Garden (poem)|The Garden]]" (1678):
&lt;blockquote&gt;How well the skilful gardener drew&lt;br&gt;
Of flow'rs and herbs this dial new;&lt;br&gt;
Where from above the milder sun&lt;br&gt;
Does through a fragrant zodiac run;&lt;br&gt;
And, as it works, th' industrious bee&lt;br&gt;
Computes its time as well as we.&lt;br&gt;
How could such sweet and wholesome hours&lt;br&gt;
Be reckoned but with herbs and flow'rs!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[anatomy]], a '''lobe''' is a clear anatomical division or extension&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emedicinehealth.com/script/main/srchcont_dict.asp?src=lobe lobe] at [[eMedicine]] Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; of an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] (as seen for example in the [[brain]], the [[lung]], [[liver]] or the [[kidney]]) that can be determined without the use of a [[microscope]] at the [[gross anatomy]] level. This is in contrast to the much smaller '''lobule''', which is a clear division only visible [[histology|under the microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siumed.edu/~dking2/intro/glands.htm#5 SIU SOM Histology GI&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interlobar duct]]s connect lobes and [[interlobular duct]]s connect lobules.

** the [[occipital lobe]]
** the [[temporal lobe]]
* The three lobes of the human [[cerebellum]]
** the [[flocculonodular lobe]]

* The two lobes of the [[thymus]]
* The two and three lobes of the [[lung]]s
** [[Left lung]]: superior and inferior
** [[Right lung]]: superior, middle, inferior
* The four lobes of the [[liver]]
** [[Left lobe of liver]]
** [[Right lobe of liver]]
** [[Quadrate lobe of liver]]
** [[Caudate lobe of liver]]
* The [[renal lobe]]s of the [[kidney]]

===Examples of lobules===
* the [[cortical lobule]]s of the kidney
* the [[lobules of testis|testicular lobules]]
* the lobules of the [[mammary gland]]
* the lobules of the [[lung]]
* the lobules of the [[thymus]]

The '''MFA Program for Poets &amp; Writers''' at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] is a graduate creative writing program.

==History==
The [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] Program for Poets &amp; Writers was founded in 1963 and is part of the English Department at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].

==About==
The MFA for Poets and Writers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst is a three-year program dedicated to writing workshops and the completion of a book-length manuscript in prose or poetry. For more than fifty years the MFA for Poets and Writers has been a place for writers to concentrate on their work and to write their books.

The program sponsors regular readings by creative writers and poets through its [https://www.umass.edu/englishmfa/visiting-writers-series Visiting Writers Series]. Recent visitors to the MFA Program for Poets &amp; Writers include Julie Iromuanya, [[Matthew Zapruder]], [[CAConrad|CAConrad]], Colin Barrett, [[Sarah Ladipo Manyika]], [[Sally Wen Mao]], [[Christine Schutt]], [[Hoa Nguyen]], [[Martín Espada]], and more.

MFA students in the graduate creative writing program work with the ''[https://www.umass.edu/juniperinstitute/#/ Juniper Summer Writing Institute]'', the ''[https://www.umass.edu/juniperinstitute/#/ Juniper Institute for Literary Arts]'', [[jubilat]], and other opportunities in applied literary arts.

==Events==
* [http://www.umass.edu/juniperinstitute/ The Juniper Summer Writing Institute] and [http://www.umass.edu/juniperyoungwriters/#/ The Institute for Young Writers].  Recent summer institute participants include [[Grace Paley]], [[Dean Young (poet)|Dean Young]], [[Matthew Zapruder]], [[Padgett Powell]], [[Mark Doty]], [[James Tate (writer)|James Tate]], [[Dara Wier]], [[Amy Hempel]], [[Christine Schutt]], [[Kelly Link]], [[Brian Evenson]], [[Kate Bernheimer]], [[Srikanth Reddy]] and [[Matthea Harvey]].

An approximate dating would be about 1880 to 1945. Considered to be at a peak in the time between the [[World War I|first]] and [[World War II|second]] world wars, it forms a late part of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. The 1940s saw the beginning of the [[Atomic Age]], where [[modern physics]] saw new applications such as the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalcentury.com/1944.html&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[computer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/ABC/Articles/First-computer.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519100021/http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/ABC/Articles/First-computer.html |archivedate=2011-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[transistor]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cedmagic.com/history/transistor-1947.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Digital Revolution]] ended the intellectual model of the machine age founded in the mechanical and heralding a new more complex model of [[high technology]].  The digital era has been called the [[The Second Machine Age|Second Machine Age]], with its increased focus on machines that do mental tasks.

In [[database theory]] and [[database|systems]], a '''monotonic query''' is one that does not lose any tuples it previously made output, with the addition of new tuples in the database. Formally, a query ''q'' over a schema ''R'' is monotonic if and only if for every two instances ''I'', ''J'' of ''R'', &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq J \Rightarrow q(I) \subseteq q(J)&lt;/math&gt; (''q'' must be a [[monotonic function]]).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abiteboul|first=Serge|title=Foundations Of Databases|year=1994|publisher=Addison-Wesley|author2=Richard Hull |author3=Victor Vianu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a monotonic query is a [[Relational algebra#Selection (σ)|select]]-[[Relational algebra#Projection|project]]-[[Relational algebra#Natural join|join]] query containing only conditions of equality (also known as [[Conjunctive query|conjunctive queries]]). Examples of non-monotonic queries are aggregation queries, or queries with set difference.

Identifying whether a query is monotonic can be crucial for query optimization, especially in view maintenance and data stream management. Since the answer set for a monotonic query can only grow as more tuples are added to the database, query processing may be optimized by executing only the new portions of the database and adding the new results to the existing answer set.

== Applications ==

=== Unnesting Queries ===
Monotonic queries are important in the topic of unnesting SQL queries.  If a query is monotonic, it implies that a nested query can actually be unnested.

=== Data streams ===

A data stream is a real-time, continuous, ordered (implicitly by arrival time or explicitly by timestamp) sequence of items.
The number of items is considered to be infinite and therefore cannot feasibly be stored in its entirety. Queries over data streams are often called ''continuous'' or ''long-running'' queries, and are mostly run over a limited window of tuples in the stream. To evaluate a continuous query, one can simply reevaluate the query over newly arrived tuples, and append the new tuples to the existing result set. More formally, let ''A(Q, t)'' be the answer set of a continuous query ''Q'' at time t, τ be the current time, and 0 the start time. Then, if Q is monotonic, its result set at time τ is

:&lt;math&gt; A(Q, \tau) =\bigcup_{t = 1}^{\tau} (A(Q,t) - A(Q, t-1)) \cup A(Q,0) &lt;/math&gt;

In contrast, non-montonic queries have the following answer semantics:

:&lt;math&gt; A(Q, \tau) =\bigcup_{t = 0}^{\tau} A(Q,t)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Nanotoxicology''' is the study of the [[toxicity]] of [[nanomaterials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buzea|first=Cristina|last2=Pacheco|first2=Ivan I.|last3=Robbie|first3=Kevin| title = Nanomaterials and nanoparticles: sources and toxicity | journal = Biointerphases | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = MR17-71 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 20419892 | doi = 10.1116/1.2815690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of quantum size effects and large surface area to volume ratio, nanomaterials have unique properties compared with their larger counterparts that affect their toxicity.  Of the possible hazards, [[inhalation exposure]] appears to present the most concern, with [[Animal testing|animal studies]] showing pulmonary effects such as [[inflammation]], [[Pulmonary fibrosis|fibrosis]], and [[Carcinogen|carcinogenicity]] for some nanomaterials. Skin contact and ingestion exposure are also a concern.

==Background==
[[Nanomaterials]] have at least one primary dimension of less than 100 [[Nanometre|nanometers]], and often have properties different from those of their bulk components that are technologically useful.  Because [[nanotechnology]] is a recent development, the health and safety effects of exposures to nanomaterials, and what levels of exposure may be acceptable, is not yet fully understood.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014-102/default.html|title=Current Strategies for Engineering Controls in Nanomaterial Production and Downstream Handling Processes|last=|first=|date=November 2013|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=1–3|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nanoparticles can be divided into combustion-derived nanoparticles (like diesel soot), manufactured nanoparticles like carbon nanotubes and naturally occurring nanoparticles from volcanic eruptions, atmospheric chemistry etc. Typical nanoparticles that have been studied are [[Titanium dioxide nanoparticle|titanium dioxide]], alumina, zinc oxide, [[carbon black]], [[Carbon nanotube|carbon nanotubes]], and [[buckminsterfullerene]].

Nanotoxicology is a sub-specialty of particle toxicology. Nanomaterials appear to have toxicity effects that are unusual and not seen with larger particles.  For example, even inert elements like gold become highly active at [[nanometre|nanometer]] dimensions. Nanotoxicological studies are intended to determine whether and to what extent these properties may pose a threat to the environment and to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mahmoudi|first=Morteza|last2=Hofmann|first2=Heinrich|last3=Rothen-Rutishauser|first3=Barbara|last4=Petri-Fink|first4=Alke|date=April 2012|title=Assessing the in vitro and in vivo toxicity of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=112|issue=4|pages=2323–38|doi=10.1021/cr2002596|pmid=22216932}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nanoparticles have much larger surface area to unit mass ratios which in some cases may lead to greater pro-inflammatory effects in, for example, lung tissue. In addition, some nanoparticles seem to be able to translocate from their site of deposition to distant sites such as the blood and the brain.

Nanoparticles can be inhaled, swallowed, absorbed through skin and deliberately or accidentally injected during medical procedures. They might be accidentally or inadvertently released from materials implanted into living tissue.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oberdörster|first=Günter|last2=Maynard|first2=Andrew|last3=Donaldson|first3=Ken|last4=Castranova|first4=Vincent|last5=Fitzpatrick|first5=Julie|last6=Ausman|first6=Kevin|last7=Carter|first7=Janet|last8=Karn|first8=Barbara|last9=Kreyling|first9=Wolfgang| title = Principles for characterizing the potential human health effects from exposure to nanomaterials: elements of a screening strategy | journal = Particle and Fibre Toxicology | volume = 2 | pages = 8 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16209704 | doi = 10.1186/1743-8977-2-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoet|first=Peter HM|last2=Brüske-Hohlfeld|first2=Irene|last3=Salata|first3=Oleg V.| title = Nanoparticles - known and unknown health risks | journal = Journal of Nanobiotechnology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 12 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15588280 | doi = 10.1186/1477-3155-2-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oberdörster|first=Günter|last2=Oberdörster|first2=Eva|last3=Oberdörster|first3=Jan| title = Nanotoxicology: an emerging discipline evolving from studies of ultrafine particles | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 113 | issue = 7 | pages = 823–39 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16002369 | pmc = 1257642 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.7339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study considers release of airborne engineered nanoparticles at workplaces, and associated worker exposure from various production and handling activities, to be very probable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ding|first=Yaobo|last2=Kuhlbusch|first2=Thomas A.J.|last3=Tongeren|first3=Martie Van|last4=Jiménez|first4=Araceli Sánchez|last5=Tuinman|first5=Ilse|last6=Chen|first6=Rui|last7=Alvarez|first7=Iñigo Larraza|last8=Mikolajczyk|first8=Urszula|last9=Nickel|first9=Carmen| title = Airborne engineered nanomaterials in the workplace-a review of release and worker exposure during nanomaterial production and handling processes | journal = Journal of Hazardous Materials | volume = 322 | issue = Pt A | pages = 17–28 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27181990 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.04.075 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties that affect toxicity==
Size is a key factor in determining the potential toxicity of a particle. However it is not the only important factor. Other properties of nanomaterials that influence toxicity include: chemical composition, shape, surface structure, surface charge, aggregation and solubility,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
and the presence or absence of [[functional group]]s of other chemicals. 
The large number of variables influencing toxicity means that it is difficult to generalise about health risks associated with exposure to nanomaterials – each new nanomaterial must be assessed individually and all material properties must be taken into account.
=== Composition ===

==== Metal-based ====
Metal based [[nanoparticle]]s (NPs) are a prominent class of NPs synthesized for their functions as [[semiconductor]]s, [[Electroluminescence|electroluminescents]], and [[thermoelectric materials]].&lt;ref name="seabra-metalnp"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Seabra | first = Amedea B. | last2 = Durán | first2 = Nelson | name-list-format = vanc | date= June 2015 | title=Nanotoxicology of Metal Oxide Nanoparticles | journal = Metals |volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 934–975 | doi = 10.3390/met5020934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomedically, these [[Antibiotics|antibacterial]] NPs have been utilized in drug delivery systems to access areas previously inaccessible to conventional medicine. With the recent increase in interest and development of [[nanotechnology]], many studies have been performed to assess whether the unique characteristics of these NPs, namely their small surface area to volume ratio, might negatively impact the environment upon which they were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schrand|first=Amanda M.|last2=Rahman|first2=Mohammad F.|last3=Hussain|first3=Saber M.|last4=Schlager|first4=John J.|last5=Smith|first5=David A.|last6=Syed|first6=Ali F.|date=2010-09-01|title=Metal-based nanoparticles and their toxicity assessment|url=|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Nanomedicine and Nanobiotechnology|language=en|volume=2|issue=5|pages=544–568|doi=10.1002/wnan.103|issn=1939-0041|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have since found that many metal and metal oxide NPs have detrimental effects on the cells with which they come into contact including but not limited to DNA breakage and oxidation, mutations, reduced cell viability, warped [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], induced [[apoptosis]] and [[necrosis]], and decreased proliferation.&lt;ref name="seabra-metalnp" /&gt;

==== Carbon-based ====
{{Main|Toxicology of carbon nanomaterials}}The latest toxicology studies on mice as of 2013 involving exposure to [[carbon nanotubes]] (CNT) showed a limited pulmonary inflammatory potential of [[MWCNT]] at levels corresponding to the average inhalable elemental carbon concentrations observed in U.S.-based CNT facilities. The study estimated that considerable years of exposure are necessary for significant pathology to occur.&lt;ref name="Carbon nanotube dosimetry: from workplace exposure assessment to inhalation toxicology"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Erdely A, Dahm M, Chen BT, Zeidler-Erdely PC, Fernback JE, Birch ME, Evans DE, Kashon ML, Deddens JA, Hulderman T, Bilgesu SA, Battelli L, Schwegler-Berry D, Leonard HD, McKinney W, Frazer DG, Antonini JM, Porter DW, Castranova V, Schubauer-Berigan MK | display-authors = 6 | title = Carbon nanotube dosimetry: from workplace exposure assessment to inhalation toxicology | journal = Particle and Fibre Toxicology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 53 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24144386 | doi = 10.1186/1743-8977-10-53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One review concludes that the evidence gathered since the discovery of fullerenes overwhelmingly points to C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; being non-toxic. As is the case for toxicity profile with any chemical modification of a structural moiety, the authors suggest that individual molecules be assessed individually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/451336793|title=Bio-applications of nanoparticles|last=|first=|date=2007|publisher=Springer|others=|year=|isbn=0387767126|editor-last=Chan|editor-first=Warren C. W.|location=|pages=|oclc=451336793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other ====
Other classes of nanomaterials include polymers such as [[nanocellulose]], and [[Dendrimer|dendrimers]].

=== Size ===
There are many ways that size can affect the toxicity of a nanoparticle.  For example, particles of different sizes can deposit in different places in the lungs, and are cleared from the lungs at different rates.  Size can also affect the particles' [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] and the specific mechanism by which they are toxic.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powers|first=Kevin W.|last2=Palazuelos|first2=Maria|last3=Moudgil|first3=Brij M.|last4=Roberts|first4=Stephen M.|date=2007-01-01|title=Characterization of the size, shape, and state of dispersion of nanoparticles for toxicological studies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17435390701314902|journal=Nanotoxicology|volume=1|issue=1|pages=42–51|doi=10.1080/17435390701314902|issn=1743-5390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dispersion state===
[[File:Nanomaterials.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nanomaterials.png|alt=Three greyscale microscope images arranged horizontally.  The left two show agglomerations of black spots on a grey background, while the right one shows a mass of tangled fibers.|thumb|400x400px|Nanomaterials present in aerosol particles are often in an agglomerated or aggregated state, which affects their toxicological properties.  The examples shown here are [[Silver nanoparticle|silver nanoparticles]], [[nickel]] nanoparticles, and multiwalled [[Carbon nanotube|carbon nanotubes]].]]
Many nanoparticles agglomerate or aggregate when they are placed in environmental or biological fluids.  The terms agglomeration and aggregation have distinct definitions according to the standards organizations ISO and ASTM, where  agglomeration signifies more loosely bound particles and aggregation signifies very tightly bound or fused particles  (typically occurring during synthesis or drying).  Nanoparticles frequently agglomerate due to the high ionic strength of  environmental and biological fluids, which shields the repulsion due to charges on the nanoparticles.  Unfortunately,  agglomeration has frequently been ignored in nanotoxicity studies, even though agglomeration would be expected to affect  nanotoxicity since it changes the size, surface area, and sedimentation properties of the nanoparticles.  In addition, many  nanoparticles will agglomerate to some extent in the environment or in the body before they reach their target, so it is desirable to study how toxicity is affected by agglomeration.

The agglomeration/deagglomeration (mechanical stability) potentials of airborne engineered nanoparticle clusters also have significant influences on their size distribution profiles at the end-point of their environmental transport routes. Different aerosolization and deagglomeration systems have been established to test stability of nanoparticle agglomerates.

=== Surface chemistry and charge ===
[[Nanoparticle|NPs]], in their implementation, are covered with coatings and sometimes given positive or negative charges depending upon the intended function. Studies have found that these external factors affect the degree of toxicity of NPs.

== Routes of administration ==
=== Respiratory ===
[[File:Carbon_nanotubes_penetrating_lung_cell.tif|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carbon_nanotubes_penetrating_lung_cell.tif|alt=A greyscale microscope image showing a rigid rod extending from both sides of a mottled cellular mass|thumb|A [[scanning electron microscope]] image of bundles of multiwalled [[carbon nanotube]] piercing an [[Alveolar cells|alveolar epithelial cell]].]]
[[Inhalation exposure]] is the most common route of exposure to airborne particles in the workplace. The deposition of nanoparticles in the respiratory tract is determined by the shape and size of particles or their agglomerates, and they are deposited in the lungs to a greater extent than larger respirable particles.  Based on [[Animal testing|animal studies]], nanoparticles may enter the bloodstream from the lungs and translocate to other organs, including the brain.&lt;ref name="Approaches to safe nanotechnology"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2009-125/|title=Approaches to Safe Nanotechnology: Managing the Health and Safety Concerns Associated with Engineered Nanomaterials|last=|first=|date=March 2009|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=11–12|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inhalation risk is affected by the [[dustiness]] of the material, the tendency of particles to become airborne in response to a stimulus.  Dust generation is affected by the particle shape, size, bulk density, and inherent electrostatic forces, and whether the nanomaterial is a dry powder or incorporated into a [[slurry]] or liquid [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]].&lt;ref name="General safe practices for working"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-147/|title=General Safe Practices for Working with Engineered Nanomaterials in Research Laboratories|last=|first=|date=May 2012|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=5–6|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal studies indicate that [[Carbon nanotube|carbon nanotubes]] and [[Carbon nanofiber|carbon nanofibers]] can cause pulmonary effects including [[inflammation]], [[Granuloma|granulomas]], and [[pulmonary fibrosis]], which were of similar or greater potency when compared with other known [[Fibrosis|fibrogenic]] materials such as [[Silica gel|silica]], [[asbestos]], and ultrafine [[carbon black]].  Some studies in cells or animals have shown [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] or [[Carcinogen|carcinogenic]] effects, or systemic [[Cardiovascular system|cardiovascular]] effects from pulmonary exposure.  Although the extent to which animal data may predict clinically significant lung effects in workers is not known, the toxicity seen in the short-term animal studies indicate a need for protective action for workers exposed to these nanomaterials.  As of 2013, further research was needed in long-term animal studies and [[Epidemiology|epidemiologic]] studies in workers. No reports of actual adverse health effects in workers using or producing these nanomaterials were known as of 2013.&lt;ref name="Current intelligence bulletin 65 - Carbon nanotubes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-145/|title=Current Intelligence Bulletin 65: Occupational Exposure to Carbon Nanotubes and Nanofibers|last=|first=|date=April 2013|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=v–ix, 33–35, 63–64|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Titanium dioxide]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) dust is considered a [[lung tumor]] risk, with [[Ultrafine particle|ultrafine]] (nanoscale) particles having an increased mass-based potency relative to fine TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, through a secondary genotoxicity mechanism that is not specific to TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but primarily related to particle size and surface area.&lt;ref name="Current intelligence bulletin 63 - TiO2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-160/|title=Current Intelligence Bulletin 63: Occupational Exposure to Titanium Dioxide|last=|first=|date=April 2011|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=v–vii, 73–78|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dermal ===
Some studies suggest that nanomaterials could potentially enter the body through intact skin during occupational exposure.  Studies have shown that particles smaller than 1 μm in diameter may penetrate into mechanically flexed skin samples, and that nanoparticles with varying physicochemical properties were able to penetrate the intact skin of pigs.  Factors such as size, shape, water solubility, and surface coating directly affect a nanoparticle’s potential to penetrate the skin.  At this time, it is not fully known whether skin penetration of nanoparticles would result in adverse effects in animal models, although topical application of raw SWCNT to nude mice has been shown to cause dermal irritation, and ''[[in vitro]]'' studies using primary or cultured human skin cells have shown that carbon nanotubes can enter cells and cause release of [[Proinflammatory cytokine|pro-inflammatory cytokines]], [[oxidative stress]], and decreased viability.  It remains unclear, however, how these findings may be extrapolated to a potential occupational risk.&lt;ref name="Approaches to safe nanotechnology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Current intelligence bulletin 65 - Carbon nanotubes" /&gt;  In addition, nanoparticles may enter the body through wounds, with particles migrating into the blood and lymph nodes.&lt;ref name="Radiation safety aspects"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncrppublications.org/Reports/176|title=Radiation Safety Aspects of Nanotechnology|last=|first=|date=2017-03-02|website=[[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]]|pages=88–90|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gastrointestinal ===
Ingestion can occur from unintentional hand to mouth transfer of materials; this has been found to happen with traditional materials, and it is scientifically reasonable to assume that it also could happen during handling of nanomaterials.  Ingestion may also accompany inhalation exposure because particles that are cleared from the respiratory tract via the [[mucociliary escalator]] may be swallowed.&lt;ref name="Approaches to safe nanotechnology" /&gt;

==Biodistribution==
[[File:Nanotoxicology.jpg|thumb|225px|Pathways of exposure to nanoparticles and associated diseases as suggested by epidemiological, in vivo and in vitro studies.]]
The extremely small size of nanomaterials also means that they much more readily gain entry into the [[human body]] than larger sized particles.  How these nanoparticles behave inside the body is still a major question that needs to be resolved. The behavior of nanoparticles is a function of their size, shape and surface reactivity with the surrounding tissue. In principle, a large number of particles could overload the body's [[phagocytes]], cells that ingest and destroy foreign matter, thereby triggering stress reactions that lead to inflammation and weaken the body’s defense against other pathogens. In addition to questions about what happens if non-degradable or slowly degradable nanoparticles accumulate in bodily organs, another concern is their potential interaction or interference with biological processes inside the body. Because of their large surface area, nanoparticles will, on exposure to tissue and fluids, immediately [[Adsorption|adsorb]] onto their surface some of the macromolecules they encounter. This may, for instance, affect the regulatory mechanisms of enzymes and other proteins.

Nanomaterials are able to cross biological membranes and access [[Cell (biology)|cells]], tissues and organs that larger-sized particles normally cannot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holsapple|first=Michael P.|last2=Farland|first2=William H.|last3=Landry|first3=Timothy D.|last4=Monteiro-Riviere|first4=Nancy A.|last5=Carter|first5=Janet M.|last6=Walker|first6=Nigel J.|last7=Thomas|first7=Karluss V.| title = Research strategies for safety evaluation of nanomaterials, part II: toxicological and safety evaluation of nanomaterials, current challenges and data needs | language = en | journal = Toxicological Sciences | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–7 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16120754 | doi = 10.1093/toxsci/kfi293 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nanomaterials can gain access to the blood stream via inhalation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
or ingestion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Broken skin is an ineffective particle barrier, suggesting that acne, eczema, shaving wounds or severe sunburn may accelerate skin uptake of nanomaterials.  Then, once in the blood stream, nanomaterials can be transported around the body and be taken up by organs and tissues, including the brain, heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, bone marrow and nervous system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
Nanomaterials have proved toxic to human tissue and cell cultures, resulting in increased [[oxidative stress]], inflammatory [[cytokine]] production and [[Necrosis|cell death]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mechanisms of toxicity ==

===Oxidative stress===
For some types of [[Nanoparticles|particles]], the smaller they are, the greater their surface area to volume ratio and the higher their chemical reactivity and biological activity.  The greater chemical reactivity of nanomaterials can result in increased production of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS), including [[free radical]]s. 
ROS production has been found in a diverse range of nanomaterials including carbon [[fullerene]]s, [[carbon nanotube]]s and nanoparticle metal oxides. ROS and free radical production is one of the primary mechanisms of nanoparticle toxicity; it may result in oxidative stress, inflammation, and consequent damage to proteins, membranes and DNA.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nel|first=Andre|last2=Xia|first2=Tian|last3=Mädler|first3=Lutz|last4=Li|first4=Ning| title = Toxic potential of materials at the nanolevel | language = en | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5761 | pages = 622–7 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16456071 | doi = 10.1126/science.1114397 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cytotoxicity ===
A primary marker for the damaging effects of NPs has been cell viability as determined by state and exposed surface area of the cell membrane. Cells exposed to metallic NPs have, in the case of copper oxide, had up to 60% of their cells rendered unviable. When diluted, the positively charged metal ions often experience an electrostatic attraction to the cell membrane of nearby cells, covering the membrane and preventing it from permeating the necessary fuels and wastes.&lt;ref name="seabra-metalnp" /&gt; With less exposed membrane for transportation and communication, the cells are often rendered inactive.

NPs have been found to induce [[apoptosis]] in certain cells primarily due to the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l damage and [[oxidative stress]] brought on by the foreign NPs electrostatic reactions.&lt;ref name="seabra-metalnp" /&gt;

=== Genotoxicity ===
Metal Oxides such as copper oxide, [[uraninite]], and [[Cobalt oxide nanoparticles|cobalt oxide]] have also been found to exert significant stress on exposed [[DNA]].&lt;ref name="seabra-metalnp" /&gt; The damage done to the [[DNA]] will often result in [[Mutation|mutated]] cells and colonies as found with the [[HPRT - Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency|HPRT]] gene test.

With comparison to more conventional toxicology studies, in nanotoxicology, characterisation of the potential contaminants is challenging. The biological systems are themselves still not completely known at this scale. Visualisation methods such as [[electron microscopy]] (SEM and TEM) and [[atomic force microscopy]] (AFM) analysis allow visualisation of the nano world. Further nanotoxicology studies will require precise characterisation of the specificities of a given nano-element : size, chemical composition, detailed shape, level of aggregation, combination with other vectors, etc. Above all, these properties would have to be determined not only on the nanocomponent before its introduction in the living environment but also in the (mostly aqueous) biological environment.

There is a need for new methodologies to quickly assess the presence and reactivity of nanoparticles in commercial, environmental, and biological samples since current detection techniques require expensive and complex analytical instrumentation.

== Policy and regulatory aspects ==
Toxicology studies of nanomaterials are a key input into determining [[Occupational exposure limit|occupational exposure limits]].

The Royal Society identifies the potential for nanoparticles to penetrate the skin, and recommends that the use of nanoparticles in cosmetics be conditional upon a favorable assessment by the relevant [[European Commission]] safety advisory committee.

The Woodrow Wilson Centre’s [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=topics.home&amp;topic_id=166192 Project on Emerging Technologies] conclude that there is insufficient funding for human health and safety research, and as a result there is currently limited understanding of the human health and safety risks associated with nanotechnology. While the US National Nanotechnology Initiative reports that around four percent (about $40 million) is dedicated to risk related research and development, the Woodrow Wilson Centre estimate that only around $11 million is actually directed towards risk related research. They argued in 2007 that it would be necessary to increase funding to a minimum of $50 million in the following two years so as to fill the gaps in knowledge in these areas.&lt;ref name="Issues"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=An Issues Landscape for Nanotechnology Standards. Report of a Workshop|url=http://ifas.msu.edu/NSWorkshopReport.pdf|publisher=Institute for Food and Agricultural Standards, Michigan State University, East Lansing|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511171215/http://ifas.msu.edu/NSWorkshopReport.pdf|archivedate=2008-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential for workplace exposure was highlighted by the 2004 Royal Society report which recommended a review of existing regulations to assess and control workplace exposure to nanoparticles and nanotubes. The report expressed particular concern for the inhalation of large quantities of nanoparticles by workers involved in the manufacturing process.&lt;ref name="Royal"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering|year=2004|title=Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties|url=http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm|accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stakeholders concerned by the lack of a regulatory framework to assess and control risks associated with the release of nanoparticles and nanotubes have drawn parallels with [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (‘mad cow’s disease'), [[thalidomide]], [[genetically modified food]], nuclear energy, reproductive technologies, biotechnology, and [[asbestosis]]. In light of such concerns, the Canadian-based [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] have called for a moratorium on nano-related research until comprehensive regulatory frameworks are developed that will ensure workplace safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.etcgroup.org/issues/nanotechnology|title=Nanotechnology|work=ETC Group|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negative-bias temperature instability''' ('''NBTI''') is a key reliability issue in [[MOSFET]]s. NBTI manifests as an increase in the [[threshold voltage]] and consequent decrease in drain current and [[transconductance]] of a MOSFET. The degradation exhibits a [[power law|power-law]] dependence on time. It is of immediate concern in p-channel [[MOSFET|MOS]] devices (pMOS), since they almost always operate with negative gate-to-source voltage; however, the very same mechanism also affects nMOS transistors when biased in the accumulation regime, i.e. with a negative bias applied to the gate.

== Physics ==
The details of the mechanisms of NBTI have been debated, but two effects are believed to contribute: trapping of positively charged [[Electron hole|holes]], and generation of interface states. 

* preexisting traps located in the bulk of the dielectric are filled with holes coming from the channel of pMOS. Those traps can be emptied when the stress voltage is removed, so that the Vth degradation can be recovered over time.
* interface traps are generated, and these interface states become positively charged when the pMOS device is biased in the "on" state, i.e. with negative gate voltage.  Some interface states may become deactivated when the stress is removed, so that the Vth degradation can be recovered over time. 

The existence of two coexisting mechanisms has resulted in scientific controversy over the relative importance of each component, and over the mechanism of generation and recovery of interface states. 

In sub-micrometer devices [[nitrogen]] is incorporated into the silicon [[gate oxide]] to reduce the gate leakage current density and prevent [[boron]] penetration. It is known that incorporating nitrogen enhances NBTI. For new technologies (45&amp;nbsp;nm and shorter nominal channel lengths), [[high-K]] metal gate stacks are used as an alternative to improve the gate current density for a given equivalent oxide thickness (EOT). Even with the introduction of new materials like hafnium oxides, NBTI remains.

With the introduction of high K metal gates, a new degradation mechanism appeared, referred to as PBTI (for positive bias temperature instabilities), which affects nMOS transistor when positively biased. In this case, no interface states are generated and 100% of the Vth degradation may be recovered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20086">'''New Philology''' generally refers to a branch of Mexican [[ethnohistory]] and [[philology]] that uses colonial-era native language texts written by Indians to construct history from the indigenous point of view. The name New Philology was coined by [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] to describe work that he and his doctoral students and scholarly collaborators in history, anthropology, and linguistics had pursued since the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "[[Charles Gibson]] and the Ethnohistory of Postconquesst Central Mexico" in ''Nahuas and Spaniards: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.'' Stanford University Press and UCLA Latin American Studies, vol. 76. 1991, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Lockhart published a great many essays elaborating on the concept and content of the New Philology and [[Matthew Restall]] published a description of it in the ''Latin American Research Review.''&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew, "A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History", ''Latin American Research Review'' - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp.113–134&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques of the New Philology have also been applied in other disciplines such as European [[medieval]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Driscoll, "[http://www.driscoll.dk/docs/words.html The words on the page: Thoughts on philology, old and new]", in: ''Creating the medieval saga: Versions, variability, and editorial interpretations of Old Norse saga literature,'' edited by Judy Quinn &amp; Emily Lethbridge. Syddansk Universitetsforlag, Odense 2010, pp. 85–102.&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
==Historical Development==
Lockhart's discusses philology and in particular the new philology in an essay for a collection of essays hosted digitally at University of Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction: Background and Course of the New Philology" ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest [[Mesoamerican]] Ethnohistory'', Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the new philology was built upon the foundation of the old, which focuses on close reading of texts and resulted in collections of printed documentation. An important nineteenth-century Mexican philologist was [[Joaquín García Icazbalceta]].  In Mexico and Latin America, nineteenth-century scholars mined the Spanish archives for colonial documentation for their national histories. A feature of the New Philology is that the publication of indigenous texts in the original language with translations with introductions was standard.  The translated texts often appeared first, followed by a separate scholarly monograph analyzing the texts. The two should be considered two parts of the same scholarly publication. Many of the scholars working in the New Philology did so before it gained that designation.  A particularly valuable online publication are essays where individual scholars discuss the process and product of translating and publishing particular native language documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Philology was developed from the 1970s and onwards, building on the work of a previous generation of scholars, most especially historian [[Charles Gibson]], whose ''Aztecs under Spanish Rule'' (1964)&lt;ref&gt;''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule&gt;'' Charles Gibson, 1964 Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and his earlier ''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'' (1952)&lt;ref&gt;''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'' Charles Gibson, 1952. Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; were major scholarly achievements, placing colonial-era Aztecs (now more commonly called [[Nahuas]]) at the center of historical analysis. The leading figure in the establishment of the New Philological historiographical approach was [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] who, in the early 1970s, began learning Nahuatl and studying local level indigenous sources in the [[Nahuatl language]]. His magnum opus was published in 1992, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest.'',&lt;ref&gt;''Nahuas After the Conquest: Social and Cultural History of the Indians of Central Mexico, sixteenth through eighteenth centuries,'' James Lockhart, 1992. Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which incorporated and extended his own work and that of others.

An early and important text in this vein was ''Nahuatl in the Middle Years'' (1976), published by Lockhart and University of Texas linguist [[Frances Karttunen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nahuatl in the Middle Years: Language contact Phenomena in Texts of the Colonial Period'', Frances Karttunen &amp; James Lockhart, 1976, University of California Press, Berkeley, California.&lt;/ref&gt; Also important for the early history of the New Philology was the publication of ''Beyond the Codices'' (1976), alluding to the existence of native language texts other than the formal ones termed codices.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond the Codices'' [[Arthur J. O. Anderson]], Frances Berdan, and James Lockhart, 1976. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arthur J. O. Anderson]], a leading figure in Mesoamerican ethnohistory for his collaboration with [[Charles Dibble]] in publishing an English translation of the [[Florentine Codex]] by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], participated in this early project of publishing local-level colonial documents.

In the mid-1970s Lockhart began mentoring history doctoral students at UCLA, who learned Nahuatl and began research on particular region documentation in Nahuatl. Sarah Cline was the first to complete a dissertation in 1981, based on these types of local-level sources, a set of 60 testaments from the central Mexican Indian polity or ''altepetl'' of [[Culhuacán (altepetl)|Culhuacán]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Testaments of Culhuacan''. S.L. Cline and Miguel Leon-Portilla (Eds.) 1984. UCLA Latin American Center Nahuatl Studies Series, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Colonial Culhuacan, 1580-1600: A Social History of an Aztec Town'', S.L. Cline, 1986. New Mexico: University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Testaments of Culhuacan, Sarah Cline. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993 Cline also published a set of early local-level Nahuatl censuses from the Cuernavaca, as ''The Book of Tributes'', as well as an analysis of all three volumes, adding to the existing published corpus.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Tributes: Early Sixteenth-Century Nahuatl Censuses from Morelos''. S. L. Cline, 1993, Museo de Antropología e Historia, Archivo Histórico Collección Antigua, vol. 549. UCLA Latin American Center Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Book of Tributes", Sarah Cline, ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Azteckischer Zensus, Zur indianischen Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft im Marquesado um 1540: Aus dem "Libro de Tributos" (Col. Ant. Ms. 551) im Archivo Historico,'' Mexico. 2 vols. Eike Hinz, Claudine Hartau, and Marie Luise Heimann-Koenen, eds. 1983. Hanover.&lt;/ref&gt; In this first generation Robert Haskett, who examined Nahuatl texts on colonial Cuernavaca, later also publishing on primordial titles.&lt;ref&gt;''Indigenous Rulers: An Ethnohistory of Indian Town Government in Colonial Cuernavaca'', Robert Haskett, 1991, University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Primordial Titles", Robert Haskett. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Schroeder delved into the rich texts produced by seventeenth-century Nahua historian, Chimalpahin, resulting in several publications &lt;ref&gt;''Chimalpahin and the Kingdoms of Chalco'', 1991, Susan Schroeder, Tucson: University of Arizona Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Chimalpahin: Society and Politics in Mexico-Tenochtitlan, Tlatelolco, Texcoco, Culhuacan, and other Nahua Altetpetl in Central Mexico.'' Domingo de San Anton Munon Chimalpahin Cuauhtlehuantzin, Arthur J.O. Anderson, Susan Schroeder, Wayne Ruwet. 1997. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of His Time: Don Domingo de San Anton Munon Chimalpahin Quahtlehuantzin''James Lockhart, Susan Schroeder, and Doris Namala.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Annals of Chimalpahin", Susan Schroeder. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory''[http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The largest number of local-level indigenous documents, such as testaments and bills of sale, are in Nahuatl, resulting in Nahuatl having the largest set of published sets of documents and monographic scholarly analyses. Rebecca Horn's dissertation on Coyoacan and later Stanford University Press monograph showed the multiple connections between Nahuas and Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;''Postconquest Coyoacan: Nahua-Spanish Relations in the Valley of Mexico.'' Rebecca Horn, 1997. Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Nahuatl and Spanish Sources for Coyoacan", Rebecca Horn. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Horn also served as associate editor of the UCLA Latin American Center's Nahuatl Studies Series.

Some UCLA later doctoral students of Lockhart, particularly [[Matthew Restall]] and Kevin Terraciano, first learned Nahuatl and then other Mesoamerican indigenous languages (Mixtec and Yucatec Maya) that had a significant corpus of documents in the language. Restall's UCLA 1995 dissertation "The World of the Cah: postconquest Yucatec Maya Society" was followed by his 1995 publication of a collection of eighteenth-century wills.&lt;ref&gt;''Life and Death in a Maya Community: The Ixil Testaments of the 1760s.'' Matthew Restall, 1995. Lancaster CA: Labyrinthos&lt;/ref&gt; and culminating in his Stanford University Press monograph, ''The Maya World: Yucatec culture and society, 1550-1850.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Maya World: Yucatec culture and society, 1550-1850''. Matthew Restall. 1997, Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sources for the Ethnohistory and Afrohistory of Postconquest Yucatan," Matthew Restall.''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory''[http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Terraciano's 1994 dissertation on the Mixtecs of Oaxaca entitled ''Ñudzahui history: Mixtec writing and culture in colonial Oaxaca'' was followed by his 2001 monograph ''The Mixtecs of Colonial Oaxaca: Ñudzahui History''.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Terraciano,''The Mixtecs of Colonial Oaxaca: Nudzahui History, sixteen through eighteenth centuries''. 2001, Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Terraciano and Restall revised the titles of their dissertations in the published monographs to allow better recognition by readers of the publication's subject; Cline used "Aztec" in the title of her monograph on Culhuacan, rather than "Nahua", which in the 1980s had little recognition value even among specialists on Latin American cultures.

Lauren Lambert Jennings explicitly applied techniques from New Philology to the study of European Song texts quoting their "central premise [as] the idea that [[codex]] is not merely a neutral container for its texts." She continued by saying that the New Philologists and scholars of "textual cultures" "posit that a work's meaning (literary and cultural) is determined by the entire manuscript matrix — its physical form, contents, scribe(s), readers, and history."&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Lambert Jennings, "Tracing Voices: Song as Literature in Late Medieval Italy" (Ph.D. dissertation: University of Pennsylvania, 2012), p. 42, online at [https://usc.academia.edu/LaurenJennings/Books/1591293/Tracing_Voices_Song_as_Literature_in_Late_Medieval_Italy]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plasterwork''' refers to [[construction]] or ornamentation done with [[plaster]], such as a layer of plaster on an interior or exterior wall structure, or plaster [[Molding (decorative)|decorative moldings]] on ceilings or walls.  This is also sometimes called [[pargeting]]. The process of creating plasterwork, called '''plastering''' or '''rendering''', has been used in building construction for centuries.  For the art history of three-dimensional plaster, see [[stucco]].

==History==

The earliest plasters known to us were lime-based. Around 7500 BC, the people of 'Ain Ghazal in Jordan used lime mixed with unheated crushed limestone to make plaster which was used on a large scale for covering walls, floors, and hearths in their houses. Often, walls and floors were decorated with red, finger-painted patterns and designs. In ancient India and China, renders in clay and gypsum plasters were used to produce a smooth surface over rough stone or mud brick walls, while in early Egyptian tombs, walls were coated with lime and gypsum plaster and the finished surface was often painted or decorated.

Modelled [[stucco]] was employed throughout the Roman Empire. The Romans used mixtures of [[Lime (material)|lime]] and sand to build up preparatory layers over which finer applications of [[gypsum]], lime, sand and [[marble]] dust were made; [[pozzolanic reaction|pozzolanic materials]] were sometimes added to produce a more rapid set. Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the addition of marble dust to plaster to allow the production of fine detail and a hard, smooth finish in hand-modelled and moulded decoration was not used until the Renaissance. Around the 4th century BC, the Romans discovered the principles of the hydraulic set of lime, which by the addition of highly reactive forms of silica and alumina, such as [[pozzolana|volcanic earths]], could solidify rapidly even under water. There was little use of [[cement#Early uses|hydraulic mortar]] after the Roman period until the 18th century.

Plaster decoration was widely used in Europe in the Middle Ages where, from the mid-13th century, [[gypsum plaster]] was used for internal and external plaster. Hair was employed as reinforcement, with additives to assist set or plasticity including malt, urine, beer, milk and eggs.

==14th century==
In the 14th century, decorative plasterwork called [[pargeting]] was being used in South-East England to decorate the exterior of timber-framed buildings. This is a form of incised, moulded or modelled ornament, executed in lime putty or mixtures of lime and gypsum plaster.  During this same period, [[terracotta]] was reintroduced into Europe and was widely used for the production of ornament.

==15th century==
In the mid-15th century, Venetian skilled workers developed a new type of external facing, called [[marmorino]] made by applying lime directly onto masonry.
==16th century==
In the 16th century, a new highly decorative type of decorative internal plasterwork, called [[scagliola]], was invented by stuccoists working in Bavaria. This was composed of gypsum plaster, [[animal glue]] and pigments, used to imitate coloured marbles and [[pietre dure]] ornament. Sand or marble dust, and lime, were sometimes added.  In this same century, the [[sgraffito]] technique, also known as graffito or scratchwork was introduced into Germany by Italian artists, combining it with modelled stucco decoration. This technique was practised in antiquity and was described by [[Vasari]] as being a quick and durable method for decorating building facades. Here, layers of contrasting lime plaster were applied and a design scratched through the upper layer to reveal the colour beneath.

==17th century==
The 17th century saw the introduction of different types of internal plasterwork. Stucco marble was an artificial marble made using gypsum (sometimes with lime), pigments, water and glue. Stucco lustro was another a form of imitation marble (sometimes called stucco lucido) where a thin layer of lime or gypsum plaster was applied over a scored support of lime, with pigments scattered on surface of the wet plaster.

==18th century==
The 18th century gave rise to renewed interest in innovative external plasters. Oil mastics introduced in the UK in this period included a "Composition or stone paste" patented in 1765 by David Wark. This was a lime-based mix and included "oyls of tar, turpentine and linseed" besides many other ingredients. Another "Composition or cement", including drying oil, was patented in 1773 by Rev. John Liardet. A similar product was patented in 1777 by John Johnson. Widely used by the architect [[Robert Adam]] who in turn commissioned [[George Jackson (plasterwork)|George Jackson]] to produce reverse-cut boxwood moulds (many of which to Adam designs). Jackson formed an independent company which still today produces composition pressings and retains a very large boxwood mould collection.

In 1774, in France, a mémoire was published on the composition of ancient mortars. This was translated into English as "A Practical Essay on a Cement, and Artificial Stone, justly supposed to be that of the Greeks and Romans" and was published in the same year. Following this, and as a backlash to the disappointment felt due to the repeated failure of oil mastics, in the second half of the 18th century water-based renders gained popularity once more. Mixes for renders were patented, including a "Water Cement, or Stucco" consisting of lime, sand, [[bone ash]] and lime-water (Dr Bryan Higgins, 1779). Various experiments mixing different limes with volcanic earths took place in the 18th century. John Smeaton (from 1756) experimented with [[hydraulic lime]]s and concluded that the best limes were those fired from limestones containing a considerable quantity of clay]ey material. In 1796, Revd James Parker patented Parker's "[[Roman Cement]]". This was a hydraulic cement which, when mixed with sand, could be used for stucco. It could also be cast to form mouldings and other ornaments. It was however of an unattractive brown colour, which needed to be disguised by surface finishes.

==19th century==
Natural [[cement]]s were frequently used in stucco mixes during the 1820s. The popularisation of [[Portland cement]] changed the composition of stucco, as well as [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]], to a harder material. The development of artificial cements had started early in the 19th century.  In 1811, [[James Frost (cement maker)|James Frost]] took out a patent for an artificial cement obtained by lightly calcining ground chalk and clay together. The French Engineer [[Louis Vicat]] in 1812–1813 experimented with calcining synthetic mixtures of  limestone and clay, a product he introduced in 1818. In 1822, in the UK, James Frost patented (another?) process, similar to Vicat's, producing what he called "British cement".  Portland cement, patented in 1824 by [[Joseph Aspdin]], was called so because it was supposed to resemble Portland stone. Aspdinís son William, and later Isaac Johnson, improved the production process. A product, very similar to modern Portland cement, was available from about 1845, with other improvements taking place in the following years.

Thus, after about 1860, most stucco was composed primarily of Portland cement, mixed with some lime. This made it even more versatile and durable. No longer used just as a coating for a substantial material like masonry or log, stucco could now be applied over wood or metal lath attached to a light wood frame. With this increased strength, it ceased to be just a veneer and became a more integral part of the building structure.  Early 19th century rendered façades were colour-washed with [[distemper (paint)|distemper]]; oil paint for external walls was introduced around 1840.

The 19th century also saw the revival of the use of oil mastics. In the UK, patents were obtained for "compositions" in 1803 (Thomas Fulchner), 1815 (Christopher Dihl) and 1817 (Peter Hamelin). These oil mastics, as the ones before them, also proved to be short-lived.

Moulded or cast masonry substitutes, such as [[cast stone]] and poured [[concrete]], became popular in place of [[quarry|quarried]] stone during the 19th century. However, this was not the first time "artificial stone" had been widely used. [[Coade Stone]], a brand name for a cast stone made from fired clay, had been developed and manufactured in England from 1769 to 1843 and was used for decorative architectural elements. Following the closure of the factory in South London, Coade stone stopped being produced, and the formula was lost.  By the mid 19th century manufacturing centres were preparing cast stones based on cement for use in buildings. These were made primarily with a cement mix often incorporating fine and coarse aggregates for texture, pigments or dyes to imitate colouring and veining of natural stones, as well as other additives.

Also in the 19th century, various mixtures of modified gypsum plasters, such as Keene's cement, appeared. These materials were developed for use as internal wall plasters, increasing the usefulness of simple [[plaster of Paris]] as they set more slowly and were thus easier to use.

==Tools and materials==

Tools and materials include [[trowel]]s, floats, [[hammer]]s, screeds, a [[Hawk (plasterer's tool)|hawk]], scratching tools, [[Utility knife|utility knives]], [[lath]]s, lath [[nail (fastener)|nails]], [[lime (mineral)|lime]], [[sand]], [[hair]], [[plaster of Paris]], a variety of [[cement]]s, and various ingredients to form [[color wash]]es.

While most tools have remained unchanged over the centuries, developments in [[Materials science|modern materials]] have led to some changes. Trowels, originally constructed from steel, are now available in a [[polycarbonate]] material that allows the application of certain new, acrylic-based materials without staining the finish. Floats, traditionally made of timber (ideally straight-grained, knot-free, yellow pine), are often finished with a layer of sponge or expanded polystyrene.

=== Laths ===
[[Image:Lath.jpg|thumb|right|Lath seen from the back with brown coat oozing through]]
{{Main|Lath}}
Traditionally, plaster was laid onto laths, rather than [[plasterboard]] as is more commonplace nowadays.

Wooden laths are narrow strips of straight-grained wood depending on availability of species in lengths of from two to four or five feet to suit the distances at which the timbers of a floor or partition are set. Laths are about an inch wide, and are made in three thicknesses; single ({{fraction|1|8}} to {{fraction|3|16}}&amp;nbsp;inch thick), lath and a half ({{fraction|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;inch thick), and double ({{fraction|3|8}}–{{fraction|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;inch thick).

The thicker laths should be used in ceilings, to stand the extra strain (sometimes they were doubled for extra strength), and the thinner variety in vertical work such as partitions, except where the latter will be subjected to rough usage, in which case thicker laths become necessary.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Laths are usually nailed with a space of about {{fraction|3|8}} of an inch between them to form a key for the plaster.

Laths were formerly all made by hand. Most are now made by machinery and are known as sawn laths, those made by hand being called rent or riven laths. Rent laths give the best results, as they split in a line with the grain of the wood, and are stronger and not so liable to twist as machine-made laths, some of the fibers of which are usually cut in the process of sawing.

Laths must be nailed so as to break joint in bays three or four feet wide with ends butted one against the other. By breaking the joints of the lathing in this way, the tendency for the plaster to crack along the line of joints is diminished and a better key is obtained. Every lath should be nailed at each end and wherever it crosses a joist or stud. All timbers over three inches (76&amp;nbsp;mm)  wide should be counter-lathed, that is, have a fillet or double lath nailed along the centre upon which the laths are then nailed. This is done to preserve a good key for the plaster.

Walls liable to damp are sometimes battened and lathed to form an air cavity between the damp wall and the plastering.

Lathing in metal, either in wire or in the form of perforated galvanised sheets, is now extensively used on account of its fireproof and lasting quality. There are many kinds of this material in different designs, the best known in England being the Jhilmil, the Bostwick, Lathing, and Expanded Metal lathing. The two last-named are also widely used in America.

Lathing nails are usually of iron, cut, wrought or cast, and in the better class of work they are galvanized to prevent rusting. Zinc nails are sometimes used, but are costly.

=== Lime plastering ===
{{Main|Lime mortar}}
Lime plastering is composed of lime, sand, hair and water in proportions varying according to the nature of the work to be done.

The lime mortar principally used for internal plastering is that [[Calcination|calcined]] from [[chalk]], oyster [[seashell|shells]] or other nearly pure [[limestone]], and is known as fat, pure, chalk or rich lime. [[Hydraulic lime]]s are also used by the plasterer, but chiefly for external work.

Perfect slaking of the calcined lime before being used is very important as, if used in a partially slaked condition, it will "blow" when in position and blister the work. Lime should therefore be run as soon as the building is begun, and at least three weeks should elapse between the operation of running the lime and its use.

==== Cheefon ====
[[Hair]] is used in plaster as a binding medium, and gives tenacity to the material. Traditionally [[horsehair]] was the most commonly used binder, as it was easily available before the development of the motor-car. Hair functions in much the same way as the strands in [[fiberglass]] resin, by controlling and containing any small cracks within the mortar while it dries or when it is subject to flexing.

[[Ox]]-hair, which is sold in three qualities, is now the kind usually specified; but horsehair, which is shorter, is sometimes substituted or mixed with the ox-hair in the lower qualities.  Good hair should be long (In the UK cow and horse hair of short and long lengths is used), and left greasey (lanolin grease) because this protects against some degradation when introduced into the very high alkaline plaster.&lt;ref&gt;J. Orsi, 2012, Degradation of hair in lime plasters, unpublished research&lt;/ref&gt; Before use it must be well beaten, or teased, to separate the lumps. In America, [[goat]]s' hair is frequently used, though it is not so strong as ox-hair. The quantity used in good work is one pound of hair to two or three cubic feet of coarse stuff (in the UK up to 12&amp;nbsp;kg per metric cube). Hair reinforcement in lime plaster is common and many types of hair and other organic fibres can be found in historic plasters [4]. However, organic material in lime will degrade in damp environments particularly on damp external renders.[5] This problem has given rise to the use of polyprolene fibres in new lime renders [6]

Manila [[hemp]] fiber has been used as a substitute for hair. Plaster for hair slabs made with manila hemp fiber broke at {{convert|195|lb|abbr=on}}, plaster mixed with sisal hemp at {{convert|150|lb|abbr=on}}, [[jute]] at {{convert|145|lb|abbr=on}}, and goats' hair at {{convert|144|lb|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Another test was made in the following manner. Two barrels of mortar were made up of equal proportions of lime and sand, one containing the usual quantity of goats' hair, and the other Manila fiber. After remaining in a dry cellar for nine months the barrels were opened. It was found that the hair had been almost entirely eaten away by the action of the lime, and the mortar consequently broke up and crumbled quite easily. The mortar containing the Manila hemp, on the other hand, showed great cohesion, and required some effort to pull it apart, the hemp fiber being undamaged.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==== Sand/aggregate ====
For fine plasterer's sand-work, special sands are used, such as silver sand, which is used when a light color and fine texture are required. In England this fine white sand is procured chiefly from Leighton Buzzard; also in England many traditional plasters had crushed chalk as the aggreate, this made a very flexible plaster suitable for timber frame buildings.

For external work [[Portland cement]] is undoubtedly the best material on account of its strength, durability, and weather resisting external properties, but not on historic structures that are required to flex and breathe; for this, lime without cement is used.&lt;ref&gt;SPAB 1990, Old Buildings need to Breathe. London&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sawdust]] has been used as a substitute for hair and also instead of sand as an [[Aggregate (composite)|aggregate]]. Sawdust will enable mortar to stand the effects of frost and rough weather. It is useful sometimes for heavy cornices and similar work, as it renders the material light and strong. The sawdust should be used dry. The sawdust is used to bind the mix sometimes to make it go further.
&lt;!-- This stuff about glass and dust may be correct or incorrect so I've commented it out for now...........................Crushed glass broken up fine can be used. Dust was used in some regions were sand could not be accessed easily. Apparently it would dry very hard.--&gt;

==Methods==

The first coat or rendering is from 1/2 to 3/4&amp;nbsp;inches thick, and is mixed in the proportions of from one part of cement to two of sand to one part to five of sand. The finishing or setting coat is about 3/16&amp;nbsp;inches thick, and is worked with a hand float on the surface of the rendering, which must first be well wetted.

===External plastering===
{{Main|Stucco}}
Stucco is a term loosely applied to nearly all kinds of external plastering, whether composed of lime or of cement. At the present time it has fallen into disfavor, but in the early part of the 19th century a great deal of this work was done. Cement has largely superseded lime for this work. The principal varieties of stucco are common, rough, trowelled and bastard. .
* Common stucco for external work is usually composed of one part hydraulic lime and three parts sand. The wall should be sufficiently rough to form a key and well wetted to prevent the moisture being absorbed from the plaster.
* Rough stucco is used to imitate [[masonry|stonework]]. It is worked with a hand float covered with rough felt (a stiff bristled brush can also be used), which forms a sand surface on the plaster. Lines are ruled before the stuff is set to represent the joints of stonework.
* Trowelled stucco, the finishing coat of this work, consists of three parts sand to two parts fine stuff. A very fine smooth surface is produced by means of the hand float.
* Bastard stucco is of similar composition, but less labor is expended on it. It is laid on in two coats with a skimming float, scoured off at once, and then trowelled.
* Colored stucco: lime stucco may be executed in colors, the desired tints being obtained by mixing with the lime various [[oxides]]. Black and grays are obtained by using forge ashes in varying proportions, greens by green enamel, reds by using litharge or red lead, and blues by mixing oxide or carbonate of copper with the other materials.

{{Main|Roughcast}}

Roughcast or pebbledash plastering is a rough form of external plastering in much use for country houses. In Scotland it is termed "[[harl]]ing". It is one of the oldest forms of external plastering. In Tudor times it was employed to fill in between the woodwork of half-timbered framing. When well executed with good material this kind of plastering is very durable.

Roughcasting is performed by first rendering the wall or laths with a coat of well-haired coarse stuff composed either of good hydraulic lime or of Portland cement. This layer is well scratched to give a key for the next coat. The second coat is also composed of coarse stuff knocked up to a smooth and uniform consistency. Two finish two techniques can be used:
* dry dash: while the first coat is still soft, gravel, [[shake (shingle)|shingle]] or other small stones are evenly thrown on with a small [[scoop (tool)|scoop]] and then brushed over with thin lime mortar to give a uniform surface. The shingle is often dipped in hot lime paste, well stirred up, and used as required.
* wet dash: the traditional roughcast, harling the scratch or undercoat is left to cure and in the final coat the gravel/agrigate is mixed with the lime and sand and thrown on with the plaster spoon/scoop.

===Sgraffito (scratched ornament)===

{{Main|Sgraffito}}
Sgraffito is the name for scratched ornament in plaster. Scratched ornament is the oldest form of surface decoration, and is much used on the continent of Europe, especially in Germany and Italy, in both external and internal situations.

Properly treated, the work is durable, effective and inexpensive. A first coat or rendering of Portland cement and sand, in the proportion of one to three, is laid on about an inch thick; then follows the color coat, sometimes put on in patches of different tints as required for the finished design. When this coat is nearly dry, it is finished with a smooth-skimming, 1/12 to 1/8&amp;nbsp;inches thick, of Parian, [[selenite (mineral)|selenitic]] or other fine cement or lime, only as much as can be finished in one day being laid on.

Then by pouncing through the pricked cartoon, the design is transferred to the plastered surface. Broad spaces of background are now exposed by removing the finishing coat, thus revealing the colored plaster beneath, and following this the outlines of the rest of the design are scratched with an iron knife through the outer skimming to the underlying tinted surface.

Sometimes the coats are in three different colors, such as brown for the first, red for the second, and white or grey for the final coat. The [[pigment]]s used for this work include Indian red, Turkey red, Antwerp blue, German blue, umber, ochre, purple brown, bone black or oxide of manganese for black. Combinations of these colors are made to produce any desired tone.

===Coats===
[[Plaster]]s are applied in successive coats or layers on walls or lathing and gains its name from the number of these coats.
* One coat work is the coarsest and cheapest class of plastering, and is limited to inferior buildings, such as outhouses, where merely a rough coating is required to keep out the weather and draughts. This is described as render on [[brickwork]], and lath and lay or lath and plaster one coat on studding.
* Two-coat work is often used for factories or warehouses and the less important rooms of residences. The first coat is of coarse stuff finished fair with the darby float and scoured. A thin coat of setting stuff is then laid on, and trowelled and brushed smooth. Two-coat work is described as render and set on walls, and lath, plaster and set, or lath, lay and set on laths.
* Three-coat work is usually specified for all good work. It consists, as its name implies, of three layers of material, and is described as render, float and set on walls and lath, plaster, float and set, or lath, lay, float and set, on lathwork. This makes a strong, straight, sanitary coating for walls and ceilings.

The process for three coat work is as follows:
* For the first coat a layer of well-haired coarse stuff, about 1&amp;nbsp;inch thick, is put on with the laying trowel. This is termed "pricking up" in London, and in America "scratch coating". It should be laid on diagonally, each trowelful overlapping the previous one. When on laths the stuff should be plastic enough to be worked through the spaces between the laths to form a key, yet so firm as not to drop off. The surface while still soft is scratched with a lath to give a key for the next coat. In Scotland this part of the process is termed "straightening" and in America "browning", and is performed when the first coat is dry, so as to form a straight surface to receive the finishing coat.
* The second or "floating coat", and is 1/4 to 3/8&amp;nbsp;inches thick. Four operations are involved in laying the second coat, namely, forming the [[screed]]s; filling in the spaces between the screeds; scouring the surface; keying the face for finishing.
** Wall screeds are plumbed and ceiling screeds leveled. Screeds are narrow strips of plastering, carefully plumbed and leveled, so as to form a guide upon which the floating rule is run, thus securing a perfectly horizontal or vertical surface, or, in the case of circular work, a uniform curve.
** The filling in, or flanking, consists of laying the spaces between the screeds with coarse stuff, which is brought flush with the level of the screeds with the floating rule.
** The scouring of the floating coat is of great importance, for it consolidates the material, and, besides hardening it, prevents it from cracking. It is done by the plasterer with a hand float that he applies vigorously with a rapid circular motion, at the same time sprinkling the work with water from a stock brush in the other hand. Any small holes or inequalities are filled up as he proceeds. The whole surface should be uniformly scoured two or three times, with an interval between each operation of from six to twenty-four hours. This process leaves the plaster with a close-grained and fairly smooth surface, offering little or no key to the coat that is to follow.
** To obtain proper cohesion, however, a roughened face is necessary, and this is obtained by keying the surface with a wire brush or nail float, that is, a hand float with the point of a nail sticking through and projecting about 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch; sometimes a point is put at each corner of the float.
* After the floating is finished to the walls and ceiling, the next part of internal plastering is the running of the cornice, followed by the finishing of the ceiling and walls.
* The third and final coat is the setting coat, which should be about 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch thick. In Scotland it is termed the "finishing coat", and in America the "hard finish coat" or "putty coat". Setting stuff should not be applied until the floating is quite firm and nearly dry, but it must not be too dry or the moisture will be drawn from the setting stuff.

The composition of an interior three coat plaster:
* The coarse stuff applied as the first coat is composed of sand and lime, usually in proportions approximating to two to one, with hair mixed into it in quantities of about a pound to two or three cubic feet of mortar. It should be mixed with clean water to such a consistency that a quantity picked up on the point of a trowel holds well together and does not drop.
* Floating stuff is of finer texture than that used for pricking up, and is used in a softer state, enabling it to be worked well into the keying of the first coat. A smaller proportion of hair is also used.
* Fine stuff mixed with sand is used for the setting coat. Fine stuff, or lime putty, is pure lime that has been slaked and then mixed with water to a semi-fluid consistency, and allowed to stand until it has developed into a soft paste.
** For use in setting it is mixed with fine washed sand in the ratio of one to three.
** For cornices and for setting when the second coat is not allowed time to dry properly, a special compound must be used. This is often gauged stuff, composed of three or four parts of lime putty and one part of plaster of Paris, mixed up in small quantities immediately before use. The plaster in the material causes it to set rapidly, but if it is present in too large a proportion the work will crack in setting.

The hard [[cement]]s used for plastering, such as Parian, Keene's, and Martin's, are laid generally in two coats, the first of cement and sand 1/2 to 3/4&amp;nbsp;inches thick, the second or setting coat of neat cement about 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch thick. These and similar cements have [[gypsum]] as a base, to which a certain proportion of another substance, such as [[alum]], [[borax]] or [[carbonate]] of [[sodium carbonate|soda]], is added, and the whole baked or [[calcination|calcined]] at a low temperature. The plaster they contain causes them to set quickly with a very hard smooth surface, which may be painted or papered within a few hours of its being finished.

{{Main|Cement render}}

In [[Australia]], plaster or [[cement render]] that is applied to external brickwork on dwellings or commercial buildings can be one or two coats. In two coat render a base coat is applied with a common mix of 4 parts sand to one part cement and one part dehydrated lime and water to make a consistent mortar. Render is applied using a hawk and trowel and pushed on about 12&amp;nbsp;mm thick to begin. For two coat, some plasterers apply two full depth bands of render (one at the base of the wall and one around chest height) which are screed plumb and square and allowed to dry while applying the first coat over the remaining exposed wall. The render is then scratched to provide a key for the second coat. This method allows the rest of the wall to be rendered and screed off without the need to continually check if the second coat is plumb. Alternatively, both coats can be applied with the plasterer using a t-bar to screed the final coat until it is plumb straight and square. The first method is generally used where quality of finish is at a premium. The second method is quicker but can be several millimeters out of plumb. The second coat can be a slightly weaker mix 5/1/1, or the same as the base coat with maybe a water proofer in the mix added to the water to minimize efflorescence (rising of salts). Some plasterers used lime putty in second coat instead of dehydrated lime in the render. The mortar is applied to about 5&amp;nbsp;mm thick and when the render hardens is screeded off straight. A wood float or plastic float is used to rub down the walls. Traditionally, water is splashed on walls using a coarse horsehair plasterers brush followed by immediately rubbing the float in a circular or figure 8 motion although a figure of 8 can leave marks. Many modern plasterers use a hose with a special nozzle with a fine mist spray to dampen walls when rubbing up (using a wood float to bring a consistent finish). Using a hose brings a superior finish and is more consistent in colour as there is more chance in catching the render before it has a chance to harden too much.  After the work area is floated, the surface is finished with a wet sponge using the same method as floating with a wood float, bringing sand to the surface to give a smooth consistent finish.

Materials used in the render are commonly local sands with little clay content with fine to coarse grains. Sand finish is common for external render and may be one or two coats. Plasterers use a t-bar to screed the walls until it is plumb straight and square. Two coat is superior as, although more expensive, it gives a more consistent finish and less chance of becoming drummy or cracking. Drummy is a term used to describe when the render doesn't bond completely with the wall, either because the wall is too smooth, a coat is too thick or by being floated when the render has hardened too much, leaving an air space that makes a drumming sound when a metal tool is "rubbed" over it.

For internal walls, two coats is the standard and follows the same method as for external rendering but with a weaker mix of five or six sand to one cement and one lime. However, instead of being finished with a sponge, the second coat is left rough and sometimes will be scored by nails inserted in the float. After drying, the surface is then scraped to remove loose grains of sand before plastering. If the walls are concrete, a splash coat is needed to ensure bonding. A splash coat is a very wet mix of two parts cement to one part sand that is "splashed" on the wall using the plasterers brush until the wall is covered. Special mixes are sometimes required for architectural or practical reasons. For example, A hospitals x-ray room will be rendered with a mix containing [[Barium sulfate]] to make the walls impervious to x-rays.

===Moldings===
Plain, or unenriched, [[Molding (decorative)|moldings]] are formed with a running mold of zinc cut to the required profile a process that has remained the same for over 200 years.
* For a cornice molding two running rules are usual, one on the wall, the other on the ceiling, upon which the mold is worked to and from by one workman, while another man roughly lays on the plaster to the shape of the molding. The miters at the angles are finished off with joint rules made of sheet steel of various lengths, three or four inches (102&amp;nbsp;mm)  wide, and about one-eighth inch thick, with one end cut to an angle of about 30°. In some cases the steel plate is let into a stock or handle of hardwood.

Enrichments may be moldings added after the main outline molding is set, and are cast in molds made of [[gelatin]] or plaster of Paris.

===Cracks===
Cracks in plastering may be caused by settlement of the building, by the use of inferior materials or by bad workmanship.

However, due to none of these, cracks may yet ensue by the too fast drying of the work, caused through the laying of plaster on dry walls which suck from the composition the moisture required to enable it to set, by the application of external heat or the heat of the sun, by the laying of a coat upon one which has not properly set, the cracking in this case being caused by unequal contraction, or by the use of too small a proportion of sand.

Traditionally, crack propagation was arrested by stirring chopped [[horsehair]] thoroughly into the plaster mix.

===Slabs===
finished with a thin setting coat or slab. In some cases, with fireproof ceilings, for instance, the metal lathing are hung up with wire hangers so as to allow a space of several inches between the soffit of the concrete floor and the ceiling. For partitions metal laths are grouted in with semi-fluid plaster. Where very great strength is required, the work may be reinforced by small iron rods through the slabs. This forms a very strong and rigid partition which is at the same time fire-resisting and of lightweight, and when finished measures only from two to four inches (102&amp;nbsp;mm) thick. So strong is the result that partitions of this class only two or three inches (76&amp;nbsp;mm)  thick were used for temporary cells for prisoners at Newgate Gaol during the rebuilding of the new sessions house in the [[Old Bailey]] in [[London]].

The slabs may be obtained either with a keyed surface, which requires finishing with a setting coat when the partition or ceiling is in position, or a smooth finished face, which may be papered or painted immediately the joints have been carefully made.

===Fibrous plaster===

Fibrous plaster is given by plasterers the suggestive name "stick and rag", and this is a rough description of the material, for it is a fibrous composed of plaster laid upon a backing of canvas stretched on wood. It is much used for moldings, circular and enriched casings to columns and girders and ornamental work, which is worked in the shop and fixed in position.

Desachy, a French modeler, took out in 1856 a patent for "producing architectural moldings, ornaments and other works of art, with surfaces of plaster," with the aid of plaster, glue, wood, wire, and canvas or other woven fabric.

The modern use of this material may be said to have started then, but the use of fibrous plaster was known and practiced by the Egyptians long before the Christian era; for ancient coffins and mummies still preserved prove that linen stiffened with plaster was used for decorating coffins and making masks. [[Cennino Cennini]], writing in 1437, says that fine linen soaked in glue and plaster and laid on wood was used for forming grounds for painting.

Canvas and mortar were in general use in Great Britain up to the middle of the 20th century. This work is also much used for temporary work, such as exhibition buildings.

==Plastering==

===Modern interior plastering techniques===

There are two main methods in USA used in construction of the interior walls of modern homes, plasterboard, also called drywall, and veneer [[plaster]]ing.

{{Main|Plasterboard}}
In plasterboard a specialized form of sheet rock known as "greenboard" (because on the outer paper coating is greenish) is screwed onto the wall-frames (studs) of the home to form the interior walls. At the place where the two edges of wallboards meet there is a seam. These seams are covered with mesh tape and then the seams and the screw heads are concealed with the drywall compound to make the wall seem as one uniform piece. The drywall plaster is a thick paste. Later this is painted or wallpapered over to hide the work. This process is typically called "taping" and those who use drywall are known as "tapers".

{{Main|Plaster veneer}}
'''Veneer plastering''' covers the entire wall with thin liquid plaster, uses a great deal of water and is applied very wet. The walls intended to be plastered are hanged with "Blueboard" (named as such for the industry standard of the outer paper being blue-grey in color). This type of sheet rock is designed to absorb some of the moisture of the plaster and thus allow it to cling the plaster better before it sets.

Veneer plastering is a one-shot one-coat application; taping usually requires sanding and then adding another coat, since the compound shrinks as it dries.

===Traditional plastering===
{{Main|Plasterer}}{{Original research|date=August 2014}}{{Howto|date=August 2014}}
The plasterer usually shows up after the hangers have finished building all the internal walls, by attaching blueboard over the frames of the house with screws. The plasterer is usually a subcontractor working in crews that average about three veterans and one laborer. The job of the laborer is to set up ahead of and clean up behind the plasterers, so they can concentrate on spreading the "mud" on the walls.

====Laborer's tasks====
* Debris left on the floors from the "hanging" crew must be removed before floor paper can be set down and to remove any tripping hazards.
* Cover the floors with tar or brown paper since plaster can stain or be hard to remove from subflooring plywood.
* Run hoses and extension cords and set up job lights.
* Cover all seams with '''meshtape''' as well as any large gaps around outlets caused by poor roto-zip work. Gouge out any bubble in the wallboard caused by broken sheetrock under the paper and cover the holes with meshtape. Remove any loose screws (flies) left from the hanger missing the underlying frame.
* Cover all windows and doors with plastic sheets and masking tape to protect the wood of their frames and save on cleaning. If any plumbing fixtures or wall plugs have been installed they are also covered, as well as the bathtubs and showers.
* Set up for the next mix. As soon as the table is cleared the laborer is given instructions of how many bags will be needed as well as the next room to be worked in. The table typically consists of folding legs upon which is set a square board of wood and then covered in a plastic sheet upon which the plaster is placed in the center in a large pile.
* Mixing the product. The mixing barrel is usually pre-filled to a certain level with water; since it can take some time to fill. The amount of water is usually estimated (with a margin of error leaning towards too little). The amount of water required is obtained from the amount of bags planned to be mixed. The estimation is not difficult for an experienced plasterer; who knows how many sheets he can typically cover, and that one bag usually covers 2 &amp; 1/2 to 3 sheets and 5 gallons of water is needed for one standard 50 pound bag. With a permanent crew that normally does the same amount per mix one can simply fill up the barrel to a known cut-off point.
* Once the mix is set up and the plasterers are ready they instruct the laborer to start dumping the bags in the water barrel, while intermittently running the mixing drill. Once all bags are in the barrel more water is slowly added until the plaster is of proper consistency and is then thoroughly mixed. Before the mixing is completed, a margin trowel (or margin for short) is scraped along the inside wall of the barrel to knock off clinging unmixed clumps (known as cutting in) to be furthered mixed until all is homogeneous.
* While mixing the drill is slowly brought up and down and follows the edge of the barrel in a circular motion to drag the top of the mix down and ensure an even consistency throughout the mix. Care is taken not to allow the drill's paddle to hit the bottom or sides of the barrel; this can scrape off plastic bits that end up in the mix.  At a certain point before the mixing is done a margin trowel is again used to scrape any clinging dry plaster into the rest of the mix. typically this is when the accelerator; if used is added.  Mixing can be fatigueing in that the drill tends to not only be heavy but the mixer must also fight the torc of the paddle.
* Shovel the mix onto the table. The mixing barrel must be emptied as soon as possible, as the plaster will set faster in the barrel then on the table. but the table cannot be overfilled or it may tip or plaster will spill off the sides and splatter when it hits the floor.  While shoveling care must also be taken not to splatter any plaster onto nearby walls.
* Clean up the mix barrel. This is done outside with a hose and nozzle. If any plaster remains they can contaminate the next mix with "rocks" that greatly vex the plasterers as they get dragged across the walls and the contamination causes the plaster to set much quicker.
* Final clean up. This includes rolling up all paper flooring in finished rooms. knocking the plaster out of plug outlet holes with a drywall hammer/hatchet, taking down any masking tape and plastic, cleaning up any plaster that has splattered onto the floor etc.

====Plasterer's tasks====
Normally the contractor has already supplied all the bags of [[Gypsum]] plaster that will be needed, as well as any external supply of water if the house is not yet connected.  The plastering crew needs to bring their own tools and equipment and sometimes supply their own bead.

''The Tasks that the plasterer is usually expected to accomplish''.
* '''''Hang cornerbead'''''
The plasterer  usually must first staple or tack [[Cornerbead]] onto every protruding (external) corner of the inside of the house. Care is taken to make sure this makes the wall look straight and is more of a skill of the eye than anything else.
** "Bead" comes in many styles; Ranging from wire mesh attached by staples to heavier metal grades that need to be tacked on with nails. Plastic varieties also exist.
** The bead must be measured and cut to size; care is taken not to bend or warp it. In places where more than one corner meets; the bead's ends are cut at an angle and the 2 or more tips are placed as close together as allowable; touching but not overlapping. The bead is completely covered with plaster as well as the rest of the wall and the plaster also helps to hold it firm. The finished product leaves only a small exposed metal strip at the protrusion of the corner which gets covered when the wall is painted. This leaves a clean, straight looking corner.
** An alternative method seen in older houses of forming a rounded or bullnosed corner uses a quirked wooden staff bead. The staff bead, a 1&amp;nbsp;inch dowel with approx 1/3 shaved off the back, is set on the external corner by the joiner on site, fastened to wooden plugs set into the brick/block seams, or to the wood frame. Plaster is run up to the staff bead and then cut back locally to the bead or "quirked" to avoid a weak feather edge where the plaster meets the bead.
** In architecture a quirk is a small 'V' shaped channel used to insulate and give relief to a convex rounded moulding. To create the plastered corner, backing coat (browning) is plastered up to the staff bead, then the quirk is cut into the backing coat a little larger than the finished size. When the top skimming coat is applied, again the bead is fully skimmed in and then, using a straight edge, the quirk is re-cut to the finished depth, usually on an approximate 45 degree angle into the bead. The quirk will hide the eventual small crack that will form between the staff bead and plaster.
* '''''Set up tools'''''
The plasterer needs to fill a 5-gallon bucket partway with water. From this bucket he hangs his [[trowel]] or trowels and places into it various tools.
** Normally a plasterer has one trowel for "laying on" (the process of placing mud onto the wall).
** Some then keep an older trowel that has a decent bend in it (banana curve) to be used for the purpose of "texturing"; if called for by the homeowner. A lay-on trowel tends to be too flat for this and the vacuum caused by the water can stick it to the wall, forcing him to tear it off and thus he has to rework the area.
** Finally, one may have a brand new trowel "not yet broken-in" which he will used for "grinding"; this is when the plaster is nearly hardened and he is smoothing out any bumps or filling in any small dips (cat faces) to make the wall look like a uniform sheet of glossy white plaster.
Most plasterers have their own preference for the size of the trowel they use. some wield trowels as large as 20&amp;nbsp;inches long but the norm seems to be a 16"×5". ''From my experience the preferred brand is a Marshalltown stainless steel. They have a brassy luster to them, a rubber handle and won't pit or rust if accidentally left in water overnight'' while others prefer a regular steal trowel which requires more maintenance but lasts for quite a long time and the pitting can give it a "bite" that helps when "finishing" (the last pass when the plaster is setting).

Into the bucket also goes a large brush used to splash water onto the wall and to clean his tools, a paint brush for smoothing corners, and  a [[corner bird]] for forming corners (''though many share one good bird to keep the room harmonious'').

These tool buckets are first kept near the mix table and then as the plaster starts to set are moved closer to the wall that is being worked on. ''Time becomes a big factor here as once the plaster starts to harden (set) it will do so fairly rapidly and the plasterer has a small margin of error to get the wall smooth''.

Onto the mixing table the plasterer usually sets his "[[hawk (plasterer's tool)|hawk]]" so it will be handy when he needs to grab it and to keep dirt off of it. Any debris in the plaster can become a major nuisance.
* ''''' Plaster tops or bottom?'''''
Plasterers will typically divide a room, (especially a large or high-ceilinged wall) into top and bottom. The one working on top will do from the ceiling's edge to about belly height and work off a milk crate for an {{convert|8|ft|m|sing=on}} ceiling, or work off stilts for 12-foot-high rooms. For cathedral ceilings or very high walls, staging is set up and one works topside, the others further below.
* ''''' Clean up before they finish a job'''''
Typically done with the laborer. No plaster globs left on the floors, walls or corner bead edges. (They will show up if painted and interfere with flooring and trim). Remove or neatly stack all trash.
* '''''Inspection'''''
All rooms and walls are inspected for cracking and dents or scratches that may have been caused from others bumping into the walls. They are also inspected to make sure no bumps are left on the walls from splashed plaster or water. All rooms are checked to make sure all plaster is knocked out of the outlets so the electrician can install the sockets and to make sure no tools are left behind. This leaves the walls ready for the painters and finishers to come in and do their trade.

====Interior plastering techniques====

=====Smooth=====
''The home owner and the plasterer's boss will usually decide beforehand what styles they will use in the house''. Typically walls are smooth and sometimes ceilings. Usually a homeowner will opt to have the ceilings use a "texture" technique as it is much easier, faster, and thus cheaper than a smooth ceiling.

The plasterer quotes prices based on techniques to be used and board feet to be covered to the contractor or homeowner before work begins. The board feet is obtained by the hangers or estimated by the head subcontractor by counting the wallboards that come in an industry standard of 8' to 12' long. He then adds in extra expenses for [[soffit]]s and cathedral ceilings.
* Ceiling second or first
Typically if the ceiling is to be smooth it is done first, before the walls. If it is to be textured, it is done after the walls.

The reason for this is that invariably when a ceiling is being worked on plaster will fall and splash onto the walls. However a texture mix doesn't need to be smoothed out when it starts to set:
* thus a retardant such as "Cream of tartar" or [[sugar]] can be used to prolong the setting time, and is easily scraped off the walls.
* and since time is not as restraining of a factor on textured ceilings a large mix, or back-to-back mixes can be done and all ceilings covered at the same time.
* another reason is that a bird is usually run along the top corner after doing a smooth ceiling, then it is easier to maintain this edge by doing the wall last. But a textured ceiling normally doesn't need to be birded, only blended in with a very wet paint brush. In this case the wall is done first and the corner formed with the bird.
* '''''Scratching'''''
The first thing the plasterer tends to do is go over all the mesh-taped seams of the walls he is about to cover; in a very thin swatch. The wallboard draws moisture out of this strip so when the plasterer goes over it again when doing the rest of the wall it will not leave an indented seam that needs further reworking.

He then fills in the area near the ceiling so he will not have to stretch to reach it during the rest of the wall; And he forms the corner with his bird. This saves much needed time as this process is a race against the chemical reaction.
* '''''Laying on'''''
From the mix table the plasterer scoops some "mud" onto the center of his hawk with his trowel. Holding the hawk in his off-hand and his trowel in his primary the plasterer then scoops a bulging roll of plaster onto his trowel. this takes a bit of practice to master, especially with soupy mixes.

Then holding the trowel parallel to the wall and at a slight angle of the wrist he tries to uniformly roll the plaster onto the wall. In a manner similar to a squeegee. He starts about an inch above the floor and works his way upwards to the ceiling. Care is taken to be uniform as possible as it helps in the finishing phase.
* '''''Knocking down'''''
Depending on the setting time of the plaster. once the moisture of the plaster starts to be drawn by the board a second pass is made. this is called knocking down. it is much like applying paint with a roller in wrist action and purpose. to smooth out any lines and fill in any major voids that will make extra work once the plaster starts to truly set. very little pressure is applied and the trowel is kept relatively flat towards the wall.
* '''''Setting'''''
Sometimes an accelerant will be added to a mix to hasten the time delay from the initial mixing phase to when the plaster starts to set. This is normally done on cold days when setting is delayed or for small jobs to minimize the wait.

Once the plaster is on the wall and starts to set (this can be determined by the table that sets first), the plasterer gingerly sprinkles water onto the wall; this helps to stall the setting and to create a slip. He then uses his trowel and often a wetted felt brush held in the opposite hand and lightly touching the wall ahead of the trowel to work this slip into any small gaps (known as "catfaces") in the plaster as well as smooth out the rough lay-on and flatten any air bubbles that formed during setting.

This is a crucial time because if the wall gets too hard it is nearly impossible to fill in any gaps as the slip will no longer set with the wall and will instead just dry and fall out. This leads to the need of what is called "grinding" as one must go over the hard wall again and again trying to smooth out the hardened wall and any major catfaces must be filled in with a contour putty, joint compound, or reworked by blending in a fresh, thin coat.

The finished wall will look glossy and uniformly flat and is smooth to the touch. After a few days it will become chalky white and can then be painted over.
* Mix
From the time the bags are dumped into the barrel to when the wall is completely set is called a mix. Varying on the technique used and whether accelerant or retardant is added, a mix typically lasts about two hours.

The final moments are the most frantic if it is smooth or if the mix sets quicker than anticipated.
If this happens it is said the mix has "snapped" and is normally due to using old product or various types of weather (humidity or hot days can cause plaster to set quicker). Normally only three or four mixes are done in a day as plastering is very tiring and not as effective under unnatural lighting in the months with early dusk.
* Seasons
Plastering is done year round but unique problems may arise from season to season. In the summer, the heat tends to cause the plaster to set faster. The plaster also generates its own heat and houses can become quite hellish. Typically the plaster crew will try to arrive at the house well before dawn.

In winter months, short days cause the need of artificial lighting. At certain angles these lights can make even the smoothest wall look like the surface of the moon. Another dilemma in the winter months is needing to use propane jet heaters (which can stain the plaster yellowish but do not otherwise hurt it), not just to keep the plasterers warm but to also prevent the water in the mix from freezing and generating ice crystals before the plaster has time to set. Also if the water hose is not thoroughly drained before leaving it can freeze over night and be completely stopped up in the morning.

=====Textured=====
Texturing is usually reserved for closets, ceilings and garage walls.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Typically a retarding agent is added to the mix. this is normally [[Cream of Tartar]] (or "Dope" in the plasterer's jargon) and care must be taken with the amount added. Too much and the mix may never set at all. However the amount used is often estimated; much the way one adds a dash of salt to a recipe. you add a small scoop of retarder, dependent on the size of the mix. Retardant is added so that larger mixes can be made, since the texture technique doesn't require the person to wait until it starts to set before working it.

The lay-on phase is the same as smooth but it is added with a thicker coat. Once the coat is on uniformly the plasterer then goes back and birds his corners. Staying away from the corner he then gets a trowel with a nice banana curve in it and starts to run it over the wall in a figure eight or Ess pattern, making sure to cross all areas at least once. He adds a little extra plaster to his trowel if needed. The overall effect is layers of paint-like swaths over the whole of the ceiling or wall. He can then just walk away and let it set with care taken not too leave any globs and to make sure the corners look smooth and linear.

If a wall is to be smooth and the ceiling textured, typically the wall is done first, then the ceiling after the wall has set. Instead of rebirding the ceiling (which would have been done when the wall was laid on), a clean trowel is held against the wall and its corner is run along the ceiling to "cut it in" and clean the wall at the same time. This line is then smoothed with a paintbrush to make the transition seamless.

=====Sponge=====
The sponge (technically called a float), has a circle form and rough surface. it is fixed to a backing with a central handhold and is roughly the size of a standard trowel. Sponge is a variant texture technique and used normally on ceilings and sometimes in closets. Typically when using a sponge; sand is added to the mix and the technique is called sand-sponge.

Care must be taken not to stand directly under your trowel when doing this as it is very, very unpleasant, and dangerous to get a grain of sand in your eye; which is compounded by the irritation from the lime as well. This combination can easily scratch the eye.

The lay-on and mix is the same as with regular texturing. however after a uniform and smooth coat is placed on the ceiling and the edges are cut in; a special rectangular sponge with a handle is run across the ceiling in overlapping and circular motions. This takes some skill and practice to do well.

The overall look is a fishscale type pattern on the ceiling, closet wall, etc. Even though retarder is typically used; care must be taken to clean out the sponge thoroughly when finished as any plaster that hardens inside it will be impossible to remove.

=====Ceilings=====
[[Stilts]] are often required to plaster most ceilings and it is typically harder to lay-on and work than walls. For short ceilings one can also work with [[milk crate]]s. The difficulty of working upside down often results in plaster bombs splattering on the floors, walls and people below.

This is why smooth ceilings, that use no retardant and sometimes even accelerant, are done before the walls.
Retarded plaster can easily be scraped off a smooth plaster wall when wet. Any splatters from a smooth ceiling can easily be scraped off bare blueboard but not from an already plastered wall. Care must be taken when standing under your trowel or another plasterer.

The general difficulty of working a smooth ceiling fetches a higher cost. The technique is the same as a smooth wall but at an awkward angle for the plasterer.

==Examples==

In England, fine examples of plasterwork interiors of the early modern period can be seen at [[Chastleton House]], (Oxfordshire), [[Knole House]], (Kent), Wilderhope (Shropshire), [[Speke Hall]], ([[Merseyside]]), and [[Haddon Hall]], ([[Derbyshire]]).

Some examples of outstanding extant historical plasterwork interiors are found in [[Scotland]], where the three finest specimens of interior plasterwork are elaborate decorated ceilings from the early 17th century at [[Muchalls Castle]], [[Glamis Castle]] and [[Craigievar Castle]], all of which are in the northeast region of that country.

The craft of modelled plasterwork, inspired by the style of the early modern period, was revived by the designers of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in late-19th- and early-20th-century England. Notable practitioners were [[Ernest Gimson]], his pupil [[Norman Jewson]], and George P. Bankart, who published extensively on the subject. Examples are preserved today at [[Owlpen Manor]] and [[Rodmarton Manor]], both in the [[Cotswolds]].

Modern ornate fibrous plasterwork by the specialist company of Clark &amp; Fenn can be seen at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], the [[London Palladium]], [[Grand Theatre Leeds]], [[Somerset House]], [[Worshipful Company of Plaisterers|The Plaisterers' Hall]] and [[St. Clement Danes]]

[[Corrado Parducci]] was a notable plaster worker in the [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] area during the middle half of the 20th century. Probably his best known ceiling is located at [[Meadow Brook Hall]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2937">In [[sociology]] and especially the [[sociology of religion|sociological study of religion]], '''plausibility structures''' are the sociocultural contexts for systems of meaning within which these meanings make sense, or are made plausible. Beliefs and meanings held by individuals and groups are supported by, and embedded in, sociocultural institutions and processes.

==Origins==

The term was coined by [[Peter L. Berger]], who says he draws his meaning of it from the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], [[G. H. Mead]], and [[Alfred Schutz]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''The Sacred Canopy - Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967) p. 45 and p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; For Berger, the relation between plausibility structure and social "world" is dialectical, the one supporting the other which, in turn, can react back upon the first. Social arrangements may help, say, a certain religious world appear self-evident. This religious outlook may then help to shape the arrangements that contributed to its rise.

==Decline of religious plausibility==

Berger was particularly concerned with the loss of plausibility of the sacred in a modernist/postmodern world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.change.freeuk.com/learning/socthink/berger.html Peter Berger's ''the Homeless Mind'' thesis]&lt;/ref&gt; Berger considered that history "constructs and deconstructs plausibility structures", and that the plurality of modern social worlds was "an important cause of the diminishing plausibility of religious traditions."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''A Rumour of Angels'' (1971) p. 121 and p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Critics have argued that Berger pays too much attention to discourse analysis and not enough to the institutional frameworks that continue to support religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wuthnow, ''Rediscovering the Sacred'' (1992) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger may also underestimate the role of self-selected [[reference group]]s in maintaining one's plausibility structures,&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology (2007) p. 319-20&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the erosion of the modernist trend of secularization that took place with [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Phillips/D. L. Okholm, ''Christian Apologetics in the Postmodern World'' (1995) p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Portingbury Hills''' ({{gbmapping|TL5320}}) or '''Portingbury Rings''' is a hill in [[Hatfield Forest]], [[Hatfield Broad Oak]], [[Essex]], suggested to date to the [[Iron Age]] or [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63851|title=A History of the County of Essex: Volume 8|author=W. R. Powell|publisher=[[Victoria County History]]|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of a 3 features, a hill and mound connected by a zig-zag causeway formed by 2 almost parallel ditches to another rectangular enclosure measuring {{convert|30|x|21|m|ft}} surrounded by a large ditch with a suggested bank up to {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide. It is located in the northwest of Hatfield Forest in Beggarshall coppice. It has been considered to be an ancient defensive enclosure, but is too small to be a [[hill fort]] and is not in a defensible position.&lt;ref&gt;Huggins, P.J., 1978, 'Pappus and Pontingbury' Essex Archaeological Society Transactions Vol. 10 p. 225-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological excavations were carried out in 1964–1965 with recovered evidence including a small flint blade 4&amp;nbsp;cm long, animal bones, flints, and charcoal with very slight dating evidence suggesting [[Iron Age]] construction. The archaeologists suggested that the initial, ‘V’ shaped, ditch surrounding the mound would have been approximately 2 metres in depth suggesting it once had earth ramparts supported by timber. Smaller banks have been noted to cross Shermore Brook to Spittlemore coppice.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, P., 1978, 'Portingbury Hills or Rings' Essex Archaeological Society Transactions Vol. 10 p. 221-4 (excavation report)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 retired geologist and researcher [[Christian O'Brien]] suggested that Portingbury Hills had a purpose in [[archaeoastronomy]] and was constructed in the [[Bronze Age]] which gave it some brief coverage in the [[Sunday Telegraph]]. O'Brien suggested that the mound was aligned astronomically with [[Wandlebury Hill]] via a series of equally spaced, hand-carved, stone monoliths forming a [[Loxodrome]]. Eleven of the original twenty-six markers are still in situ, such as the [[Leper Stone]], with several of the other distinctive stones lying nearby.&lt;ref name="Essex_geo"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.essexwt.org.uk/geology/sites3.htm | title = The Geology of Essex | accessdate = 2011-03-08 | publisher = Essex Wildlife Trust | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725131837/http://www.essexwt.org.uk/geology/sites3.htm | archivedate = 2011-07-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien's theory met with mixed reviews from astronomers and archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5wEpAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=wandlebury+o'brien&amp;dq=wandlebury+o'brien&amp;hl=en The Antiquaries Journal, Volume 57, Oxford University Press, 1978]&lt;/ref&gt; Glyn Daniel, Professor of Archaeology at [[Cambridge University]] dismissed the paper as "nonsense"  and [[Alexander Thom]] could find nothing in it to revise the documented view of Wandlebury as an [[Iron Age]] Fort.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13215">The term “School Brand”, similar to "brand" as it applies to traditional business applications, is any type of term, mark or insignia, which identifies one organization or product from another. These marks were intended to indicate an affiliation with a particular school, group, organization, trade, manufacturer, or maker.

== History ==

While “branding” has history as far back as 1100&amp;nbsp;BCE, in a period referred to as the [[Vedic Period]], “School Branding” however is a relatively new concept. Many universities and colleges, now operate in a businesslike market where students are “customers” and other schools are competition. To successfully compete, a school must develop and market its own brand that differentiates it from the thousands of other schools vying for students and funding. Although most have marketing budgets, schools are still climbing the learning curve when relating to effective branding.

According to Branding Strategy Insider, school branding surfaced in the early 1800s when a few sororities and fraternities literally branded their pledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2006/08/history_of_bran.html/ |title=History of Branding - Brand Strategy Insider |publisher=Brandingstrategyinsider.com |date=2006-08-14 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, tobacco and patent medicine companies began branding their products as a way to identify them and build buyer loyalty. Brand identity also helped protect the customer by holding companies more accountable for product quality. By the mid-1800s, branding became central to business strategy as consumer companies such as [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] began using it in their marketing.

Higher education waited over a century to follow the corporate world. According to University Business, schools adopted branding in the early 2000s, when they realized that higher learning had evolved into a marketplace of customers and providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitybusiness.com/article/have-college-brands-delivered-their-promise|title=Have College Brands Delivered on Their Promise?|author=Robert A. Sevier|publisher=UB University Business|date=2009-09-01|accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of for-profit and online universities created more choices for students, and those newer schools were aggressively marketing in corporate style. Students were becoming more diverse, and schools could no longer take demographics for granted. At the same time, schools ranging from elementary to colleges and universities, had to compete harder for government funding and private endowments. To meet the challenges, universities invested in market research, logos and other marketing efforts that often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

== Present situation ==

Today’s school branding goes a step further and identifies a school’s unique competitive advantage. As stated in the Gallup Business Journal, a brand promises what the student experience will be like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessjournal.gallup.com/content/28081/building-brand-higher-education.aspx/ |title=Building Brand Higher Education - Gallup Business Journal |publisher=Businessjournal.gallup.com |date=2007-07-12 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many school departments produce their own distinctive communications, which can muddy the message. Colleges are grappling with the fact that the message is only effective if the entire faculty and leadership commit as one voice to the brand promise.

Schools also need to communicate their brand in a way that resonates emotionally with students. When people feel a message, they are more likely to remember it and respond. Brandgarten advocates using archetypes in branding to focus the emotional message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandgarten.com/2012/05/07/branding-higher-education|title=Branding Higher Education|publisher=brandgarden|date=May 5, 2012|accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a school that places a high value on community service might use the archetype of the caregiver to tell its story. Prospective students would hear the call to service in all of the college's communications and could decide whether it was a potential match. Prior to branding, the same college would have been lost among superficially similar schools.

One recent rebranding occurred when [[Beaver College]], in Pennsylvania, surveyed prospective students and discovered that 30 percent of people considering the university did not apply because of the name. As a result, Beaver College was rebranded as [[Arcadia University]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunzel|first1=David|title=Universities Sell Their Brands|journal=The Journal of Product and Brand Management|date=2007|volume=16 |issue=2|pages=152-153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition of need ==

[[Harvard University]], viewed as the college gold standard, relies on branding to help recruit students and donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randall |first=Kevin |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1361340/does-branding-pay-colleges-harvard-thinks-so/ |title=Does Branding Pay Off for Colleges? Harvard Thinks So |publisher=Fast Company |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university took a lesson from its own business school and has applied for trademarks to protect several taglines. According to Fast Company, Harvard has already won approval for the taglines "Ask what you can do" and "Lessons learned". Harvard has also taken the entrepreneurial step of licensing its name to an upscale clothing line, which helps with branding as well as its funding mission.

Although colleges may be fairly new to branding, Neuromarketing points out that they represent the longest-lived brands in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fri, Jul 17, 2009 Neuromarketing, Branding |url=http://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/college-branding.htm/ |title=College Branding |publisher= Neuromarketing |date=2009-07-17 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools exist for decades and even centuries and today have thousands of rivals. As baby boomers age out of the education market, the declining number of prospective students is increasing competition among schools. Schools have responded with glossy marketing campaigns but still lag in branding. Neuromarketing notes that much college marketing material portrays similar images of a pleasant campus filled with smiling professors and a diverse student body. Websites, brochures and even tours often leave students and their families no wiser as to what makes a particular school special.

The missing ingredient is brand development, as [[Columbia University]] discovered in recent years. According to Neuromarketing, Columbia branded itself as the only Ivy League school in New York City and began showcasing the Manhattan experience in its marketing materials. Student applications have since increased over the competition, and many applicants cited location as the reason they chose Columbia University. Administrators of Columbia University realized that name recognition alone was not enough to attract more of the right students, and its branding strategy paid off.

Even as schools compete for students, those students are learning to brand themselves in an effort to impress colleges. High school is the right time to start building a personal brand, advises Visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vizibility.net/blog/its-never-too-early-personal-branding-for-high-school-college-students/ |title=It’s Never Too Early - Personal Branding for High School &amp; College Students - Visibility |author=Adrian Maynard| publisher=Vizibility.net |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young students can take several steps to enhance their uniqueness, beginning with defining a niche that will serve as the core of their brand. To build the school brand, they can start a quality blog and network both online and offline about its subject. Additional help in for schools in building a brand can be found by extended resources to companies like VIP Branding, who specializes in school branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalvillageconcerns.com/ |title=Specializing in School Branding - VIP Branding |publisher=Globalvillageconcerns.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allocation of resources to expert branding companies, allows school administrators to focus their attention to the needs of the school. By the time these students are ready to apply for college, they will have an edge over those who left personal branding up to the admissions essay.

Today’s students shop with brand awareness, and schools need to have a compelling message in place to attract them. Online school stores, like the ones offered through the Varsity Shop Program, provide a new avenue for schools to market themselves and their brand, through specialty designed and branded products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsityshop.com/ |title=Varsity Shop Program |publisher=varsityshop.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although schools tends to be leery of corporate tactics, branding is an opportunity for them to define for themselves what makes them special. By doing so, schools enrich what they offer creating school spirit and student pride, helping students to carry that commitment and care onto higher education.

== Repercussions of improper use ==

While many school administrators, recognize the power of school branding, the lack of resources and funding have led to alternative solutions to professional branding. Logo infringement has increased through the years as a result of this acknowledged need for branding. Numerous schools across the United States are infringing upon trademarked logos without realizing they are in violation. The [[Sanford Herald]] notated a recent case with [[Lake Mary High School]] out of [[Florida]], was in such a case, when the school was given a cease and desist order to terminate the use of their ram logo because as their ram logo was too similar the [[Dodge Ram]] logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mysanfordherald.com/view/full_story_obits/7668253/article-Lake-Mary-rallies-around-new-ram|title=Lake Mary rallies around a new ram|author=Rachel Delinski|publisher=The Sanford Herold|date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, logo infringement is accidental, but the resulting repercussions of using trademarked logos can lead to litigation, exorbitant fines, and can be disparaging on school morale.

In addition to logo infringement, the loss of brand identity is another resulting drawback to improper school branding. Unprofessionally designed logos or mascots, can lead to an undesired identity or a variety of versions, which can lead to brand confusion as notated in by Brand Empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brandempowerment.com/schools/school-challenges/brand-control/ |title=Brand Control |publisher=Brand Empowerment |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shemer Art Center and Museum''' is an art education facility and gallery in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. The center was founded in 1984 by Martha Shemer, who purchased a [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|mission-style]] house and three acres not only to preserve the property but to donate it to the City of Phoenix to be used for art education. Budget constraints nearly closed the center in 2010, but citizens founded the Shemer Art Center and Museum Association to help manage and preserve the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4049">'''Structural fracture mechanics''' is the field of [[structural engineering]] concerned with the study of load-carrying structures that includes one or several failed or damaged components. It uses methods of analytical [[solid mechanics]], structural engineering, [[safety engineering]], [[probability theory]], and [[catastrophe theory]] to calculate the load and stress in the structural components and analyze the safety of a damaged structure. 

[[Image:StructuralFractureMechanicsModel.png|thumb| Model of structural fracture mechanics.]]

There is a direct analogy between [[fracture mechanics]] of solid and structural fracture mechanics: 

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|+ Analogy between fracture mechanics of solid and structural fracture mechanics
|-
! !! Fracture mechanics !! Structural fracture mechanics
|-
| Model || Solid with a crack || Multi-component structure with a failed component
|-
| Defect driving force || [[Stress intensity factor]] || Overload stress
|-
| System property || [[Fracture toughness]] || Reserve ability / Structural robustness
|-
|}

There are different causes of the first component failure: 
1) [[mechanical overload (engineering)|mechanical overload]], [[fatigue (material)]], unpredicted scenario, etc.  
2) “human intervention” like unprofessional behavior or a terrorist attack.

There are two typical scenarios: 

A.	A localized failure does NOT cause immediate collapse of the entire structure.

B.	The entire structure fails immediately after one of its components fails.

If the structure does not collapse immediately there is a limited period of time until the catastrophic [[structural failure]] of the entire structure. There is a critical number of structural elements that defines whether the system has reserve ability or not.&lt;ref&gt;Kokcharov I. Reserve ability of parallel system with failed elements. Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics, Volume 48, Issue 3, December 2007, Pages 225-230&lt;/ref&gt; 

Safety engineers use the failure of the first component as an indicator and try to intervene during the given period of time to avoid the catastrophe of the entire structure. For example, “Leak-Before-Break”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/te_710_web.pdf Applicability of the leak before break concept. Report of the IAEA Extrabudgetary Programme on the Safety of WWER-440 Model 230 Nuclear Power Plants, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; methodology means that a leak will be discovered prior to a catastrophic failure of the entire piping system occurring in service. It has been applied to pressure vessels, nuclear piping, gas and oil pipelines, etc.

The methods of structural fracture mechanics are used as checking calculations to estimate sensitivity of a structure to its component failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kokch.kts.ru/me/t6/SIA_6_Structural_Safety.pdf Kokcharov I., Burov A. Structural Integrity Analysis. Part 6. Structural Safety. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:CatastropheFailureModel.png|frame|287px| Catastrophe failure model and reserve ability of a complex system]]

The failure of a complex system with parallel redundancy can be estimated based on probabilistic properties of the system elements. The model&lt;ref&gt;Kokcharov I. Failure probability assessment of parallel redundant structures. Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics, Volume 36, Issue 2, September–October 2001, Pages 109-114&lt;/ref&gt; supposes that failure of several elements causes neighboring elements overloading. The model equation (1) shows the relationship between local and external stresses. The equation (1) is similar to the cusp catastrophe behavior. The theory predicts reserve ability of the complex system and the critical external stress.

'''Supergalactic coordinates''' are [[coordinates]] in a [[spherical coordinate system]] which was designed to have its [[equator]] aligned with the '''supergalactic plane''', a major structure in the local universe formed by the preferential distribution of nearby [[galaxy cluster]]s (such as the [[Virgo cluster]], the [[Great Attractor]] and the [[Pisces-Perseus supercluster]]) towards a (two-dimensional) [[plane (mathematics)|plane]].  The supergalactic plane was recognized by [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]] in 1953 from the [[Shapley-Ames Catalog]], although a flattened distribution of [[nebula]]e had been noted by [[William Herschel]] over 200 years earlier. [[Vera Rubin]] had also identified the supergalactic plane in the 1950s, but her data remained unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2016/10/vera-rubin|title=How Vera Rubin Discovered Dark Matter|last=Scoles|first=Sarah|date=4 October 2016|work=Astronomy.com|access-date=2017-10-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By convention, supergalactic latitude and supergalactic longitude are usually denoted by SGB and SGL, respectively, by analogy to {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''l''}} conventionally used for [[galactic coordinates]].  The zero point for supergalactic longitude is defined by the intersection of this plane with the galactic plane.

==Definition==
*The north supergalactic pole (SGB = 90°) lies at galactic coordinates ({{math|''l''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 47.37°, {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} = +6.32°). In the [[equatorial coordinate system]] ([[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] [[J2000]]), this is approximately [[right ascension|RA]] = 18.9&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;, [[declination|Dec]] = +15.7°.
*The zero point (SGB = 0°, SGL = 0°) lies at (''l''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 137.37°, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 0°). In J2000 equatorial coordinates, this is approximately 2.82&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;, +59.5°.
So the transformation from a triple of Cartesian supergalactic coordinates to a triple of galactic coordinates is
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix}_\text{gal} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos l_x \cos b_x &amp; \sin l_z \cos b_z \sin b_x - \sin b_z \sin l_x \cos b_x &amp; \cos l_z \cos b_z \\
    \sin l_x \cos b_x &amp; \sin b_z \cos l_x \cos b_x - \cos l_z \cos b_z \sin b_x &amp; \sin l_z \cos b_z \\
             \sin b_x &amp; \cos b_z \cos b_x \sin\left(l_x - l_z\right)                       &amp; \sin b_z
 \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix}_\text{superg}
&lt;/math&gt;

The left column in this matrix is the image of the origin of the supergalactic system in the galactic system, the right column in this matrix is the image of the north pole of the supergalactic coordinates in the galactic system, and the middle column is the cross product (to complete the right handed coordinate system).

[[Image:TRADOC Analysis Center.png|right|200px]]
The '''United States Army Training and Doctrine Command Analysis Center (TRAC)''' is an analysis agency of the [[United States Army]]. TRAC conducts research on potential military operations worldwide to inform decisions about the most challenging issues facing the Army and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD). TRAC relies upon the intellectual capital of a highly skilled workforce of military and civilian personnel to execute its mission. 

TRAC conducts [[operations research]] (OR) on a wide range of military topics, some contemporary but most often set 5 to 15 years in the future. How should Army units be organized? What new systems should be procured? How should soldiers and commanders be trained? What are the costs and benefits of competing options? What are the potential risks and rewards of a planned military course of action? TRAC directly supports the mission of the Army's Training and Doctrine Command ([[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|TRADOC]]), to develop future concepts and requirements while also serving the decision needs of many military clients.

== TRAC mission statement ==
To produce relevant and credible operations analysis to inform decisions. TRAC serves many clients and has many stakeholders, but has only one shareholder: the American Soldier.

== TRAC organization ==
TRAC is led by a civilian SES director, subordinate to the Commanding General of the US Army Training and Doctrine Command, and comprises four centers:&lt;ref&gt;TRADOC Regulation 10-5-7, Organization and Functions U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center, 29 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* TRAC-Fort Leavenworth (TRAC-FLVN), led by a civilian SES director, is co-located with TRAC headquarters at [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]] (i.e. US Army Combined Arms Center (CAC)) and has traditionally conducted analysis at the operational level (i.e. Corps and Division).
* TRAC-White Sands Missile Range (TRAC-WSMR), led by a civilian SES director, is located at [[White Sands Missile Range]] in [[New Mexico]] and has traditionally conducted analysis at the tactical level (i.e. Brigade and below).
* TRAC-Lee, led by a civilian GS-15, is located at [[Fort Lee, VA]] and has traditionally conducted analysis in the area of Logistics.
* TRAC-Monterey, led by a Lieutenant Colonel (LTC), is co-located with the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] (NPS) in [[Monterey, CA]] and has traditionally utilized the resources of NPS to conduct research into new models and methodologies.

Each center director is subordinate to the TRAC director.

TRAC headquarters has two components:
* The director's staff element comprising the deputy director, an O-6 colonel, and administrative assistants
* The Program and Resources Directorate (PRD), in coordination with center directors, oversees the day-to-day operations of all TRAC elements
*

== The discipline of OR ==
The discipline of [[operations research]] is built upon the collaboration of interdisciplinary team members who have mutually supporting knowledge, skills and experiences pertinent to the study problem. The TRAC building blocks of military operations analysis are future scenarios; leading edge models and simulations; realistic data about systems, forces, and behavior; and skilled operations analysts. Leading a core team of analysts, a TRAC Study Director may receive support from other TRADOC and Army agencies, and from other government agencies and industry as well. TRAC adheres to the proven principles of scientific inquiry and applies the problem solving model to perform its analysis.

=== The TRAC program ===
The TRAC program of operations research and analysis is forward-looking and addresses a wide range of military topics. The analysis is conducted within a joint framework of combined arms operations across a full spectrum of missions and environments. TRAC leads TRADOC's major studies of new warfighting operations and organization (O&amp;O) concepts and requirements. TRAC leads the Army's analysis of [[Advanced Warfighting Experiments]] (AWEs), and the Army's [[Analysis of Alternatives]] (AoA). The analysis topics span doctrine, training, leader development, organization, materiel, and soldier support.

Scenarios are used by the U.S. Army for education, training and force development. Director, TRAC is the TRADOC executive agent for development of scenarios for use in studies and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;TRADOC regulation TR 71-4. United States Army Training And Doctrine Command Standard Scenarios For Capability Developments, 23 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; TRAC develops scenarios of potential military operations set in the future for use in modeling and analysis. TRAC relies upon input and assistance from many Army and DoD agencies, other Services and the Combatant Commanders to develop and apply a family of scenarios depicting joint operations of corps and divisions, and brigades and battalions. The family of scenarios undergoes continual review and change in anticipation of emerging threats and new operational environments around the world based on intelligence estimates.

=== Tools ===
Military operations are highly complex processes and typically must be modeled in order to be analyzed. The analytic tools may take the form of:
* table-top map games,
* [[human-in-the-loop]] (HITL),
* (HITL) simulations and simulators,
* closed-form Models &amp; Simulations (M&amp;S), and

TRAC develops and maintains a class of warfighting M&amp;S referred to as force-on-force, ranging from individual objects (e.g., soldier, weapon, terrain feature) to aggregated objects (e.g., battalions) at corps level. TRAC M&amp;S represent the Army's de facto standards for force-on-force M&amp;S and are widely used by military, industry and allies. TRAC is a significant contributor to advanced M&amp;S research and improved modeling methodologies in the military.
