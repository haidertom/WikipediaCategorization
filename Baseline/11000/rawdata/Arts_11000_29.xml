'''''Ab initio''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|b|ᵻ|ˈ|n|ɪ|ʃ|i|.|oʊ}} {{respell|AB|i|NISH|ee-oh}})&lt;ref&gt;[[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a Latin term meaning "from the beginning" and is derived from the Latin ''ab'' ("from") + ''initio'', [[ablative case|ablative]] [[grammatical number|singular]] of ''initium'' ("beginning").

==Etymology==
{{circa|1600}}, from L., lit. "from the beginning", from ablative case of ''initium'' "entrance, beginning", related to verb ''inire'' "to go into, enter upon, begin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etymology for ab initio|publisher="etymonline.com"|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ab+initio|accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
''Ab initio'' (abbreviation: ''ab init.'') is used in several contexts, including the following:

===Law===

In [[law]], ''ab initio'' refers to something being the case from the start or from the instant of the act rather than from when the court declared it so. For instance, the term "void ''ab initio''" means "to be treated as invalid from the outset." E.g., in many jurisdictions, if a person signs a contract under duress, that contract is treated as being "void ''ab initio''".

Typically, documents or acts which are [[void (law)|void]] ''ab initio'' cannot be fixed and if a jurisdiction, a document or an act is so declared at law to be void ''ab initio'', the parties are returned to their respective positions that they were at the beginning of the event.

"Void ''ab initio''" is often contrasted with "voidable", such documents which become void only as of the date of the judicial declaration to that effect.

An insurer facing a claim from an insured who had deceived the insurer on a material fact would claim that the insurance contract was void ''ab initio''; it was null and void from the beginning and that since there was no legally enforceable contract, the insurer ought not to have to pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Legal definition at Duhaime.org|publisher="duhaime.org"|url=http://duhaime.org/legaldictionary/a/abinitio.aspx |accessdate=7 February 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100214123816/http://duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/A/AbInitio.aspx| archivedate= 14 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and engineering===

* [[Documentation]] of a process is said to be ''ab initio'' (or ''[[:wikt:from scratch|from scratch]]'', or ''[[:wikt:from the ground up|from the ground up]]'') if the documentation shows how to set up and complete the process from basic materials (to which a competent practitioner is expected to have access) without prior special preparation.
* A calculation is said to be ''ab initio'' (or "from [[First principle#In physics|first principles]]") if it relies on basic and established laws of nature without additional assumptions or special models. For example, an ''ab initio'' calculation of the properties of liquid water might start with the properties of the constituent hydrogen and oxygen atoms and the laws of electrostatics and quantum mechanics. From these basics, the properties of isolated individual water molecules would be derived, followed by computations of the interactions of larger and larger groups of water molecules, until the bulk properties of water had been determined.
* In chemistry, an abbreviation referring to [[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''ab initio'' quantum chemistry methods]].
* [[Ab initio methods (nuclear physics)|Ab initio methods]] in [[nuclear physics]].
* In biophysics, a method for the prediction of protein structures in protein folding.
* In [[aviation]], the very first stage of flight training.
* In [[bioinformatics]], ''ab initio'' is a method for making predictions about biological features using only a computational model without extrinsic comparison to existing data. In this context, it may be sometimes interchangeable with the Latin term ''[[:wikt:de novo|de novo]]''.

===Other uses===

* when describing literature, it is told from the beginning as opposed to ''[[in medias res]]'' (meaning starting in the middle of the story)
* when describing a subject or a module, say when a person is learning French from the beginning, they are said to be a student of French ''ab initio''
* in language didactics, foreign languages may be studied ''ab initio'', meaning that the course is designed for students with no previous knowledge.

'''Afghan art''' has spanned many centuries. One of the most significant periods is the [[Gandhara Art|Gandharan art]] made between the 1st and 7th centuries developing out of [[Greco-Buddhist art]].  With the arrival of Islam, modern [[Afghanistan]] was for long periods part of [[Persia]]n states, and its art was often an important part of [[Persian art]] and [[Islamic art]] in general. 

Since the 1900s, the nation began to use Western techniques in art. Afghanistan's art in many media was originally almost entirely done by men, although women were greatly involved in other media, but recently women are entering the arts programs at [[Kabul University]]. Art is largely centered at the [[National Museum of Afghanistan]], the [[National Gallery of Afghanistan]] and the [[National Archives of Afghanistan]] in [[Kabul]]. There are a number of art schools in the country. The Center for Contemporary Arts Afghanistan (CCAA) in Kabul provides young people an opportunity to learn contemporary painting.

==Metalwork==
A collection of over 20,600 gold ornaments, some of them dating back to the Bronze Age, was discovered in Afghanistan in the late 1970s.  Known as the [[Bactrian Hoard]], these coins, necklaces and other pieces of jewelry were found in burial mounts in [[Sheberghan]] in Jowzjan Province.  They have been displayed in museums in the US and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/afghanistan-treasures/index.html "Afghanistan: Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208155022/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/afghanistan-treasures/index.html |date=February 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Greco-Buddhist Art==
{{Main|Greco-Buddhist art}}
Greco-Buddhist art was prevalent in Afghanistan from the 4th Century BCE to around the 7th Century CE due to the Islamic Conquest. Many of these art forms have been found in the archaeological site of Hadda, Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/afghanistan/Data/Mapsystem/Archeological_Sites/html/img/19.jpg See image]&lt;/ref&gt; The 6th-century [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] are a well-known example of Gandhara art from this period. They were [[Destruction_of_Art_in_Afghanistan#The_Giant_Buddhas_of_Bamiyan|destroyed]] by the Taliban in 2001.  [[File:Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction.jpg|thumb|Taller Buddha in 1963 and in 2008 after destruction]]

==Islamic Art==
After the Islamic conquest of Afghanistan, Afghan art changed dramatically from previous Greco-Buddhist works, due to the adoption of Islam. Afghan local materials such as lapis lazuli were adapted for use in [[Islamic Art]]. Mosques built in Afghanistan and in the Arab world are built with elaborate tiling styles. Many of these styles were influenced from Chinese ceramics &lt;ref&gt;Canby, 120-123, and see index; Jones &amp; Mitchell, 206-211&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan served as a conduit for introduction to these Chinese ceramic styles and techniques due to its strategic location on the Silk Road.

==Performance Art==
[[Buz-baz]] is a form of musical [[puppetry]] found in Afghanistan.  The puppeteer manipulates a [[markhor]] [[marionette]] while simultaneously playing a [[dambura]].

==Fine Art==
Afghanistan fine art was protected during the Taliban times by art masters at the Senai Art School.  The professors often hid "un-Islamic" paintings from the Taliban when they would visit and inspect. Other artists used water color over oil paintings to conceal faces and images not approved by the Taliban. Since 2002, the Afghan fine art master painters have been able to conduct many more exhibitions within Central Asia and Europe. Their oil and water color paintings are often found in the realism style, as that is what most Afghans prefer. One of the most infamous artists of that time was Sackin Nuqud. &lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.about-afghanistan.com/afghanistan-art-history.html Afghanistan Art History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105033420/http://www.about-afghanistan.com/afghanistan-art-history.html |date=January 5, 2012 }},&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Art==
Since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, contemporary art has seen a resurgence in Afghanistan.  Beginning in 2009, international funding for the arts has flowed into Afghanistan from the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name=Qantara&gt;{{cite web|first=Martin|last=Gerner|date=28 June 2012|title=Solutions Don't Always Come from Elsewhere|url=http://en.qantara.de/Solutions-Dont-Always-Come-from-Elsewhere/19387c20542i1p501/index.html|publisher=Qantara.de|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Kabul]]-based artist [[Aman Mojadidi]] curated a 2012 [[Documenta]] exhibit in Kabul which showcased 12 contemporary Afghan artists whose work includes digital photography, textiles, abstract painting, filmmaking and mixed media.&lt;ref name=Qantara /&gt;

The '''''Alba Bible''''' is a 1430 [[illuminated manuscript]] translation of the [[Old Testament]] made directly from [[Hebrew]] into [[Mediaeval Castilian]]. The translation was carried out under the direction of Moses Arragel, [[rabbi]] of the [[Judaism|Jewish]] community of [[Maqueda]] in the [[Spain|Spanish]] province of [[Toledo (province)|Toledo]], at the behest of Don Luis de Guzmán, Grand Master of the military-religious [[Order of Calatrava]].&lt;ref&gt;Finn Business Services Pty.

==History==
[[File:The-zeal-of-phinehas-15th-c.jpg|thumb|The Zeal of [[Phinehas]]]]
During the 15th century, many people within Spanish society held hostile views toward Jews. In the aftermath of a series of anti-Semitic riots centered in Madrid,&lt;ref name="classic"&gt;University of Wisconsin (2001). ''[http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg003.htm The Bible.

Retrieved October 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Don Luis de Guzmán believed that he could help heal the rift and build a bridge of understanding between Christians and Jews by commissioning a Castilian translation of the Old Testament from the original [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], accompanied by commentary from Jewish scholars interpreting the text of their holy book.&lt;ref&gt;Old Manuscripts &amp; Incunabula (2006). ''[http://www.omifacsimiles.com/cats/facs.html Facsimile Editions London: The Alba Bible]''. Retrieved October 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 1422, Don Luis de Guzmán initiated his project by sending a letter to rabbi Moses Arragel inviting him to compose ''"vna biblia en rromançe, glosada e ystoriada."''  It is not known what convinced rabbi Arragel to accept as he initially demurred in an extensive reply letter to Guzmán. Nevertheless, eight years later the bible was completed.&lt;ref&gt;''A Blurred Encounter in Moses Arragel's Epistle on the Alba Bible''. Wallace S. Lipton  MLN, Vol. 84, No. 2, Hispanic Issue (Mar., 1969), p. 298. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2908023 Digital abstract at JSTOR]. Retrieved October 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1492, the year in which the [[Alhambra Decree]] issued mandating the expulsion of all Jews from Spain, until 1622, when it resurfaced in the Palace of Liria owned by the [[House of Alba]], the whereabouts of the Alba Bible were unknown. In 1922 an illustrated facsimile edition of 300 copies was published by the scholar Antonio Paz y Meliá.  In 1992, to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the expulsion, Mauricio Hatchwell Toledano, President of the Fundacion Amigos de Sefarad published 500 copies in an exact [[facsimile]] edition, one of which was given to [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], the reigning [[List of Spanish monarchs|King of Spain]].&lt;ref name="facsimile"&gt;Facsimile Editions Limited (2006). ''[http://www.facsimile-editions.com/en/ab/ The Alba Bible: HISTORY OF THE MANUSCRIPT]''. Retrieved October 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the original Alba Bible is preserved by the [[House of Alba]], and is on exhibition in the [[Liria Palace|Palace of Liria]], in [[Madrid]]. The original Bible has been valued at 2.5 million [[euro]]s.&lt;ref name="noticias"/&gt; Copies of the 500 limited edition [[facsimile]] copies reproduced in 1992 sell for upwards of US$44,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facsimile-editions.com/en/ab Facsimile Editions Limited, London]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Education in the U.S.}}
'''Art education in the United States''' reflects the social values of [[American culture]]. [[Apprenticeship]] was once the norm and the main sense, however with the democratization of education, particularly as promoted by educational philosopher [[John Dewey]], opportunities have greatly expanded. Elliot Eisner has been an influential advocate for the benefits of art in the schools.

Enrollment in art classes at the high-school elective level peaked in the late 1960s to the early 1970s with that period's emphasis on individuals expressing uniqueness. Currently "art [[magnet schools]]", available in many larger communities, use art(s) as a core or underlying theme to attract those students motivated by personal interest or with the intention of becoming a professional or commercial artist. It is widely reported that the arts are losing instruction time in school based upon budget cuts in combination with increasing test-based assessments of children which the federal government's [[No Child Left Behind]] (NCLB) act requires. The NCLB retains the arts as part of the "core curriculum" for all schools, it does not require reporting any instruction time or assessment data for arts education content or performance standards, which is reason often cited for the decline or possible decline of arts education in American public schools.

==Picture study movement, before 1930==
Art appreciation in America accelerated with the "picture study movement" in the late 19th century. The movement began to fade at the end of the 1920s.{{sfn|Eisner|2004}} Picture study was an important part of the art education curriculum. Attention to the aesthetics in classrooms led to public interest in beautifying the school, home, and community, which was known as “Art in Daily Living”. The idea was to bring culture to the child to change the parents.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peter (1986,Sept.) The Ecology of Picture Study, ''Art Education''[48-54].&lt;/ref&gt;

Picture study was made possible by the improved technologies of reproduction of images, growing public interest in art, the Progressive Movement in education, and growing numbers of immigrant children who were more visually literate than they were in English. The type of art included in the curriculum was from the Renaissance onward, but nothing considered “modern art” was taught. Often, teachers selected pictures that had a moral message. This is because a major factor in the development in aesthetics as a subject was its relationship to the moral education of the new citizens due to the influx of immigrants during the period. Aesthetics and art masterpieces were part of the popular idea of self culture, and the moralistic response to an artwork was within the capabilities of the teacher, who often did not have the artistic training to discuss the formal qualities of the artwork.

A typical Picture Study lesson was as follows: Teachers purchased materials from the Perry Picture Series, for example. This is similar to the prepackaged [[curriculum]] we have today. These materials included a teacher’s picture that was larger for the class to look at together, and then smaller reproduction approximately 2 ¾” by 2” for each child to look at. These were generally in black and white or sepia tone. Children would often collect these cards and trade them much like modern day baseball cards. The teacher would give the students a certain amount of information about the picture and the artist who created it, such as the picture’s representational content, artist’s vital statistics, and a few biographical details about the artist. These were all included in the materials so an unskilled teacher could still present the information to his or her class. Then the teacher would ask a few discussion questions. Sometimes suggestions for language arts projects or studio activities were included in the materials.

The picture study movement died out at the end of the 1920s as a result of new ideas regarding learning art appreciation through studio work became more popular in the United States.

==Since World War II==
Since [[World War II]], artist training has become the charge of colleges and universities and contemporary art has become an increasingly academic and intellectual field. Prior to World War II an artist did not need a college degree. Since that time the [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] and then the [[Master of Fine Arts]] became recommended degrees to be a professional artist, necessities facilitated by "the passage of the [[G.I. Bill]] in 1944, which sent a wave of World War II veterans off to school, art school included. University art departments quickly expanded. American artists who might once have studied at bohemian, craft-intensive schools like the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Lee Bontecou]], [[Al Held]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Donald Judd]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Cy Twombly]] and hundreds of others did or [[Black Mountain College]] as [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and others did or the [[Hans Hofmann]] School of Art in [[Greenwich Village]] whose students included [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Lee Krasner]] and [[Larry Rivers]] among others; began enrolling at universities instead. By the 60s, The [[School of Visual Arts]], [[Pratt Institute]], and [[Cooper Union]] in New York City and other art schools across the country like the [[Kansas City Art Institute]], the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], and the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], as well as [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Yale]] had emerged as the leading American art academies; its alums included [[Roxy Paine]], [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[Beverly Pepper]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[R.B. Kitaj]], [[Sylvia Plimack Mangold]], [[Elizabeth Peyton]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Peter Reginato]], [[Robert Graham (sculptor)|Robert Graham]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Karen Finley]], [[Jason Rhoades]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Leon Golub]], [[Jeff Koons]], [[Joan Jonas]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Michael Fried]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Jennifer Bartlett]], [[John Currin]], and [[Robert Mangold]], making it seem as if every hip artist in New York was obligated to have a college degree or an Ivy League degree".&lt;ref&gt;"How to Succeed in Art" by Deborah Solomon, New York Times Magazine. June 27, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This trend spread from the United States around the world.

Currently, the PhD in studio art is under debate as the new standard as the terminal degree in the arts. Although in 2008 there are only two United States programs offering a PhD in studio art, "10 universities offer the degree in Australia, and it is ubiquitous in the UK, Scandinavia, the Netherlands and other countries. It is already expected for a teaching job in Malaysia".&lt;ref&gt;"Art Schools: A Group Crit," p. 108. Art In America, May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As James Elkins, the chair of the department of art history, theory and criticism at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago as well as the chair of the department of art history at the University of Cork in Ireland wrote in [[Art in America]], "By the 1960s the MFA was ubiquitous. Now the MFA is commonplace and the PhD is coming to take its place as the baseline requirement for teaching jobs".&lt;ref&gt;"Art Schools: A Group Crit," p. 109. Art In America, May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in reference to teaching positions for studio art at the college level.  The PhD has been a standard requirement to be a professor of art education for many years.  In his forthcoming book, ''Artists with PhD's'', [[James Elkins (art critic)]] presents the opinion the PhD will  become the new standard, and offers the book as a resource for assessing these programs and for structuring future programs. However, the College Art Association still recognizes the MFA as the terminal degree, stating "At this time, few institutions in the United States offer a PhD degree in studio art, and it does not appear to be a trend that will continue or grow, or that the PhD will replace the MFA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=College Art Association |url=http://www.collegeart.org/guidelines/mfa.html |title=Standards and Guidelines &amp;#124; College Art Association &amp;#124; CAA &amp;#124; Advancing the history, interpretation, and practice of the visual arts for over a century |work=Collegeart.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discipline-based art education in the early 1980s==
Discipline-based art education (DBAE) is an educational program formulated by the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]] in the early 1980s.  DBAE supports a diminished emphasis on studio instruction, and instead promotes education across four disciplines within the arts: aesthetics, [[art criticism]], art history and art production. It does retain a strong tie to studio instruction with an emphasis on technique.&lt;ref&gt;Neperud, Ronald W.  ''Context, Content and Community in Art Education'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the objectives of DBAE are to make arts education more parallel to other academic disciplines, and to create a standardized framework for evaluation.  It was developed specifically for grades K-12 but has been instituted at other levels of education.  DBAE advocates that art should be taught by certified teachers, and that "art education is for all students, not just those who demonstrate talent in making art".&lt;ref&gt;Dobbs, Stephen Mark.  ''Readings in Discipline Based Art Education'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of DBAE is voiced from postmodern theorists who advocate for a more pluralistic view of the arts, and inclusion of a diverse range of viewpoints that may not be included in a standardized curriculum.

== History of art education provisions ==
In the 1970s, provisions for arts in education were limited, at the discretion of individual states. Local schools, school boards, and districts were the main actors in deciding whether arts education was provided. Where art education was offered, it consisted of exposure-based experiences with cultural organizations outside of the school and was not integrated into classroom curriculum. In the next couple decades, budget cuts as a result of fiscal crises heavily stripped school budgets to the point where positions for art teachers were essentially eliminated in order to retain core subjects. At this time, arts was seen as nonessential to the development of critical thinking and there did not exist a standard curriculum for teaching art in public schools. As such, provisions were scarce if at all present in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.7249/mg702wf.9|title=Revitalizing Arts Education Through Community-Wide Coordination|date=2008|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833043061|editor-last=Bodilly|editor-first=Susan J.|edition=1|pages=9–24|editor-last2=Augustine|editor-first2=Catherine H.|editor-last3=Zakaras|editor-first3=Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the significance of an arts education emerged as data found academic performance improvements and socio-emotional and socio-cultural benefits, among other positive effects, stemming from the stimulative nature of the arts. Key players in advocating for and providing art education included a blend of public entities (school, government agencies, etc.), private organizations, and community centers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This emerging acknowledgement of the importance of art education was matched by a decline in provisions at the beginning of the 19th century. With the implementation of NCLB, public schools prioritized meeting Academic Performance Index (API) growth targets, downgrading the emphasis on non-core subjects. For example, in California public schools, while enrollment increased by 5.8% from 1999 to 2004, music education decreased by 50% in the same 5-year period.&lt;ref&gt;Music for All Foundation, 2004, ''The Sound of Silence – The Unprecedented Decline of Music Education in California Public Schools.'' Retrieved from https://www.americansforthearts.org/by-program/reports-and-data/legislation-policy/naappd/the-sound-of-silence-the-unprecedented-decline-of-music-education-in-california-public-schools-a&lt;/ref&gt; On a national level, data from the Surveys of Public Participation in the Arts (SPAAs) showed that in 2008, 18-24 year olds were less likely to have had an arts education than in 1982. Low-income and low-performing public schools disproportionately struggled with this decline, and African-American and Latino students are generally less able to access the arts when compared to their White counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Rabkin, N., &amp; Hedberg, E. C. (2011). ''Arts education in America: What the declines mean for arts participation.'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://arts.gov/publications/arts-education-america-what-declines-mean-arts-participation&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings of drastic declines in art education provisions spurred efforts for reinvestment. The NEA declared goals including maximizing investment impact, collaboration with local education across levels of government, and offering guidance and leadership support for art education.&lt;ref&gt;HUDSON, A. (2014). [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=99624574&amp;site=eds-live A New Vision for Arts Education]. ''Education Digest'', ''80''(4), 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, funding for education in the United States comes from three levels; local level, state level and federal level. The whole system of education is kept in the hands of public sector for control and to avoid any mishandling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whatisusa.info/education-in-usa/|title=Education in the U.S.|date=4 May 2013|accessdate=2012-01-01|publisher=What is USA News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] began awarding Arts in Education Model Development and Dissemination grants to support organizations with art expertise in their development of artistic curricula that helps students to better understand and retain academic information. One such model of education was created in 2006 by the Storytellers Inc. and ArtsTech (formerly Pan-Educational Institute). The curricula and method of learning is titled AXIS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalaxis.org/ AXIS - Education Revolution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== National organizations ==
The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) is one of the many nationally recognized organizations promoting arts education in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.gov/pub/ArtsLearning.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216181026/http://nea.gov/pub/ArtsLearning.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its formation in 1965, the NEA has led efforts in integrating the arts as a part of the core education for all K-12 students. These efforts include collaborating in state, federal, and public-private partnerships to solicit and provide funding and grants for programs in arts education. During the 2008 fiscal year, the NEA awarded over 200 grants totaling $6.7 million to programs that allow students to engage and participate in learning with skilled artists and teachers. The NEA has initiated a number of other arts education partnerships and initiatives, which include:

* The Arts Education Partnership (AEP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aep-arts.org Arts Education Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''AEP convenes forums to discuss topics in arts education, publishes research materials supporting the role of arts education in schools, and is a clearinghouse for arts education resource materials.''
* The Strategic National Arts Alumni Project (SNAAP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snaap.indiana.edu/ |title=SNAAP: Strategic National Arts Alumni Project &amp;#124; Learning about the lives and careers of art graduates in America |work=Snaap.indiana.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; is ''an ongoing, online survey system will collect, track, and disseminate data on alumni, and will help institutions to better understand how students use arts training in their careers and other aspects of their lives.''
* The NEA Education Leaders Institute (ELI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Each institute gathers teams of school leaders, legislators, policymakers, educators, professional artists, consultants, and scholars from up to five states to discuss a shared arts education challenge and engage in strategic planning to advance arts education in their respective states.''

There are a variety of other National organizations promoting arts education in the United States.  These include [[Americans for the Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsusa.org/artseducation Americans for the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; which features major projects such as The Arts. Ask For More.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsusa.org/Public_awareness ''Art.

==Arts integration==
{{Main|Arts integration}}
Arts integration is another and/or alternative way for the arts to be taught within schools.  Arts integration is the combining of the visual and/or performing arts and incorporating them into the everyday curriculum within classrooms. Learning in a variety of ways allows for students to use their eight multiple intelligences as described by theorist [[Howard Gardner]] in his ''Frames of Mind: Theory of Multiple Intelligences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28500715|title=Frames of mind : the theory of multiple intelligences|last=1943-|first=Gardner, Howard,|date=1993|publisher=Fontana|isbn=9780006862901|edition=2nd|location=London|oclc=28500715}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The eight [[Theory of multiple intelligences|multiple intelligences]] include bodily-kinesthetic, intrapersonal, interpersonal, linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, naturalist, and spatial.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, T. (2009) Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom.  Alexandria, Virginia:  ASCD.&lt;/ref&gt; Arts integration is especially important today when some schools no longer have or have small arts education programs due to significant budget cuts, including the federal budget agreement that took $12.5 million from the NEA, the United State's largest public arts funder, in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harsell|first=Dana Michael|date=2013|title=My Taxes Paid for That?! or Why the Past Is Prologue for Public Arts Funding|jstor=43284282|journal=PS: Political Science and Politics|volume=46|issue=1|pages=74–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6962">{{about|the art movement|the college|Bacone College}}

The '''Bacone style''' or '''Bacone school''' of [[painting]], [[drawing]], and [[printmaking]] is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] Flatstyle art movement, primarily from the mid-20th century in Eastern [[Oklahoma]]. This art movement bridges historical, tribally-specific pictorial painting and carving practices towards an intertribal [[modernism|Modernist]] style of easel painting.

==Origins==
Named for [[Bacone College]], an Indian college in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], this style is also influenced by the art programs of [[Chilocco Indian Agricultural School|Chilocco Indian School]], north of [[Ponca City, Oklahoma]], and [[Haskell Indian Nations University|Haskell Indian Industrial Training Institute]], in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]. This area features a mix of Southeastern, Prairie, and Central [[Plains tribes]]. Tribes from these regions each have their own historical practices of pictorial representation, whether in carving or painting; however, [[Indian removal|removal]] to [[Indian Territory]] in the 19th century disrupted many customary art practices. Access to Western art materials gave Native artists a new means of self-expression and recording history and daily practices.

[[Acee Blue Eagle]] (1907–1959) helped shape the Bacone style. Being [[Muscogee Creek]], [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], and [[Wichita peoples|Wichita]], he used Southeastern Woodland and Central Plains influences in his work, which frequently portrayed cultural or historic information about his tribes in a stylized, narrative form. Blue Eagle served as the first director of Bacone's art department from 1935 to 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Silberman 47&lt;/ref&gt; [[Woody Crumbo]] ([[Potawatomi]]) succeeded him in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Silberman 86&lt;/ref&gt; 1938 is the year artist [[Ruthe Blalock Jones]] ([[Shawnee Tribe|Shawnee]]/[[Delaware Tribe of Indians|Delaware]]/[[Peoria people|Peoria]]) gives for the establishment of the Bacone School of Indian painting,&lt;ref&gt;Wyckoff 55&lt;/ref&gt; while some would give the year 1935.&lt;ref name=parker&gt;Parker, Gerri. [http://faculty.deanza.edu/parkergerri/stories/storyReader$216 "Native American Art in Oklahoma: The Kiowa and Bacone Artists."] ''DeAnza College.'' 27 July 2004 (retrieved 8 Nov 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bacone style differs from the two other prevalent flat styles of Native painting of the time: Southern Plains style and the Studio style. The Southern Plains style had its origins in [[Plains hide painting]] and [[winter count]]s. After the decline of buffalo herds in the late 19th century, Plains painting shifted to [[Ledger art]], which, under the stewardship of such artists as [[Silver Horn]] (1860/1–1940, [[Kiowa]]), evolved into easel art. Southern Plains flatstyle painting gained international fame with the [[Kiowa Six]] in 1928. The Southern Plains style is the most dynamic, action-based on these mid-20th-century painting styles.

The Studio style, as taught at the [[Santa Fe Indian School]], first by [[Dorothy Dunn]] then [[Gerónima Cruz Montoya]] ([[Ohkay Owingeh]], 1915–2005), built upon the accomplishments of the [[San Ildefonso Pueblo]] school of painters and [[Hopi]] painters such as [[Fred Kabotie]], who were successful easel artists in the 1910s and 1920s in [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]]. These artists were inspired by Pueblo mural painting and pottery painting traditions. Their work often features pastoral scenes in muted colors.&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; Collectively, these three Flatstyle movements were sometimes derided by Native artists in the 1960s as "Bambi Art," which has been criticized as nostalgic, sentimental, and limited in scope.&lt;ref name=m105&gt;Morand et al. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and media==
Both Blue Eagle's and Crumbo's styles were also influenced by the streamlined, bold look of [[Art Deco]].&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; [[Casein]] on illustration board was a popular medium, as well as [[gouache]] and [[watercolor]]. Technical skill in draftsmanship was emphasized, as was the ethnographic accuracy of subjects portrayed. Paintings were aesthetically pleasing, with contours of a certain hue often surrounded by outlines of lighter tints, to emphasize the spiritual nature of the subject. Figures were brilliantly colored with backgrounds of a "subdued palettes of greens, blues, and browns," as Ruthe Blalock Jones writes.&lt;ref&gt;Wyckoff 54&lt;/ref&gt; Blue, in particular, is a color representing sorrow, loss, and memory for some Southeastern tribes, and is often a preferred background color. Implied narrative gave the Bacone style a sense of drama.&lt;ref name=parker/&gt;

==Development==
The [[Philbrook Museum of Art]] of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] helped foster the development of the Bacone style with its ''Indian Annual'' competitive art show from 1947 to 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Wyckoff 40&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Five Civilized Tribes Museum]] of [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]] and the [[Cherokee Heritage Center]] of [[Park Hill, Oklahoma]] both host annual arts shows with categories specifically for this style of art (the [[Cecil Dick]] award and the [[Jerome Tiger]] award, respectively). The [[Gilcrease Museum]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] and [[National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City]] have extensive collections of Bacone School art.

'''Bani Thani''' refers to an [[Indian miniature|Indian miniature painting]] painted by [[Nihâl Chand]] from the Marwar school of [[Kishangarh]]. It portrays a woman who is elegant and graceful. The painting's subject, Bani Thani, was a singer and poet in [[Kishangarh]] in the time of king Sawant Singh (1748–1764).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/51852/Bani-Thani Bani Thani] britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.indiaprofile.com/art-crafts/kishangarhminiatures.htm Kishangarh Miniatures - In Quest Of Divine Love] indiaprofile.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/hindi/india/2012/10/121017_monalisa_india_ss.shtml bbc.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; She has been compared to the [[Mona Lisa]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Inspired by [[Radha]], Bani Thani is characterized by idealized distinct features such as arched eyebrows, lotus-like elongated eyes and pointed chin.&lt;ref name="Sodhi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sodhi |first1=Jiwan|title=A Study of Bundi School of Painting |chapter=Kishangarh |publisher=Abhinav |year=1999 |pages=25–26 |isbn=81-7017-347-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This painting was featured in an Indian stamp issued on 5 May 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mintageworld.com/media/detail/2689-Bani-Thani-The-Indian-Mona-Lisa/?gclid=CKmjq-GxrdMCFdERaAod_xUMfQ|title=‘Bani Thani’: The Indian Mona Lisa|work=Mintage World|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Legend ==
Bani Thani was believed to be the mistress of King Sawant Singh, and later became one of his wives. Her real name was Vishnupriya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.speakingtree.in/article/bani-thani|title=BANI THANI|website=www.speakingtree.in|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a singer employed by his stepmother and he was drawn to her because of her beauty and singing. She came to be known as 'Bani Thani', which means "the decked out lady", because of the exquisite jewellery and makeup that she used to adorn herself with after becoming queen. He also wrote poetry for her under the pen name of Nagari Das. Their love bloomed due to a shared interest in singing, poetry and devotion for [[Krishna]]. She also wrote poetry under the pen name of Rasikbihari. Later, he commissioned his artists to depict their relationship in a way similar to the love between Radha and Krishna. Both lovers died in the 1760s. They have twin [[chhatris]] dedicated to them near the Nagari Kunj temple.

== Style and theme ==
The Kishangarh school of art is notable for its elongated style, with ''"arched eyebrows, lotus-like elongated eyes and pointed chin"'' a highly idealized facial form reminiscent of Indian sculpture art.&lt;ref&gt;A Study of Bundi School of Painting
By Jiwan Sodhi, page 146&lt;/ref&gt; Kishangarh was influenced by [[Hadoti|Būndi]] painting in its use of lush vegetation, dramatic night skies, vivid movement and [[Mughal art|Mughal]] painting in its use of side-profile portraits, though it can be distinguished from both of them due to its extremely meticulous details, rich colours and fine technique.&lt;ref&gt;A Study of Bundi School of Painting
By Jiwan Sodhi, page 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/South-Asian-arts/Visual-arts-of-India-and-Sri-Lanka-Ceylon#ref533114|title=South Asian arts - Visual arts of India and Sri Lanka (Ceylon)|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patron-king Savant Singh was a member of the [[Vallabha Acharya|Vallabhācārya]] sect devoted to [[Krishna]], due to which religiously themed paintings flourished in the court under his patronage. The paintings of Kishangarh school are characterised by a religious fervour and this might have been the reason why the portraiture of the queen was compared to, and is believed to have been inspired by, the figure of Radha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Kishangarh-painting#ref26813|title=Kishangarh painting {{!}} Indian art|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Sringara-rasa Nayika ==
Within the [[Ashta Nayika]] classification system of heroines, the Bani Thani is identified as the Vasakasajja Nayika type, with the element of [[Sringara]] rasa (romantic love) predominating. Hence, the painting conveys the passionate and romantic elements of the legend. She has been portrayed with all the elements of Sringara and exaggerated facial features which are unrealistic but striking. This style of portraiture later became the standard of beauty in all the later paintings of the Kishangarh school.

The '''coat of arms of Kaliningrad''' is the official heraldic achievement of [[Kaliningrad]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geraldika.ru/symbols/647|title=Герб города Калининград (1996, 1999 гг.)|publisher=geraldika.ru|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The arms displays a medieval ship for the harbour on the [[Baltic Sea]], which has been important for the city since its foundation in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=NGW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/rus/k/kalining.htm|title=KALININGRAD (Калининград) (Königsberg)|publisher=[[Heraldry of the World]]|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship is flying a pennant resembling the [[Russian Navy Ensign]] on the top of the mast.

In the middle is an [[inescutcheon]] with the old smaller arms of the city, used when it was called [[Königsberg]] (it changed names in 1946, following its seizure by the Soviet Union from Germany). Königsberg is German for "King's Mountain"; the crown may be a symbol for the king. The adjacent towns of [[Kneiphof]] and Neustadt Königsberg (originally called [[Löbenicht]]) were merged with Königsberg in 1724 and their three shields were often used together during the following time, [[supporter|supported]] by the [[coat of arms of Prussia|Prussian eagle]].&lt;ref name=NGW/&gt;

The city uses a flag which is a [[banner of arms]].

[[File:Teergonean court cairn.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The remains of the chamber of Teergonean court cairn]]

The '''court cairn''' or '''tomb''' is a [[megalithic]] type of [[chamber tomb]] and [[gallery grave]], specifically a variant of the [[chambered cairn]], found in western and northern [[Ireland]], and in mostly southwest [[Scotland]] (where it may also be called a '''horned cairn''' or '''Clyde-Carlingford tomb'''), around 4000–3500&amp;nbsp;[[Common Era|BCE]], but many remained in use until as late as the [[Bronze Age]] transition, c. 2200&amp;nbsp;BCE. They are generally considered to be the earliest chambered cairn tombs in Scotland, and their construction technique was probably brought from Scotland to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;''Ulster Journal of Archaeology'', Volume 58 Ulster Archaeological Society Ulster Archaeological Society, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
In Scotland, they are most common in what today are [[Argyll]] and [[Dumfries and Galloway]] (where they form the ''[[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]]-[[Carlingford Lough|Carlingford]] group''), though a small outlying group have been found near [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].

==Form and purposes==
Court tombs are rectangular burial chambers. They are distinguished by their roofless, oval forecourt at the entrance. Large slabs of rock were used to make the walls and roof of the very basic burial chamber, normally located at one end of the [[cairn]], which although usually blocked after use could be immediately accessed from the outside courtyard. They are [[gallery grave]]s rather than [[passage grave]]s, since they lack any significant passage.

They usually had two functions: the chamber to serve as a tomb, and the courtyard to accommodate a ritual. Objects were often buried with the deceased, as the first neolithic people of this time believed in life after death.

'''''Dance in the Country''''' (French: ''Danse à la campagne'') is an 1883 oil painting by French artist [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. It is currently kept at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Orsay"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pierre Auguste Renoir, ''Danse à la campagne'' |url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/oeuvres-commentees/peinture.html |publisher=[[Musée d'Orsay]] |language=French |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
This painting was commissioned in 1882 by the merchant [[Paul Durand-Ruel]] who wanted works on the theme of the [[Ball (dance)|ball]]. He bought it in 1886, exhibited it for the first time in April 1883, and kept it until Renoir's death in 1919. A complementary painting on the same theme, named ''[[Dance in the City]]'', was also painted by Renoir the same year.&lt;ref name="Orsay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{cite book |title=Musée d'Orsay, art et architecture |first=Peter J |last=Gartner |publisher=Ullmann |place=China |year=2010 |pages=244, 245 |language=French |isbn=978-3-8331-5443-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting, influenced by the artist's trip in [[Italy]] in 1881 where he found inspiration from [[Raphael]], marked an evolution of the painter who tried then to break away from [[Impressionism]].&lt;ref name="Ullmann"/&gt;

==Description==
The painting depicts a couple dancing under a chestnut tree: the man is Paul Lhôte, a friend of the painter, and the woman is [[Aline Charigot]], who later became the wife of the painter. Both figures are painted life-size and occupy almost the entire painting. However, a table in the background on the right, and a hat on the ground,  and a pair of faces below the level of the dance floor, can be seen. The woman who holds a fan in her right hand, displays a smiling face and looks towards the viewer. The scene is bathed in a bright and cheerful atmosphere, and the women's clothes use warm colors (yellow gloves, red hat).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Renoir - Les classiques de l'art |publisher=Flammarion |year=2005 |place=Paris |page=130 |language=French |isbn=2-08-011445-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dust Storm (Manter, Kansas)''''' is a 3D digital simulation work of art, by [[John Gerrard (artist)|John Gerrard]].

==History==
In 2008, the '''''Dust Storm''''' was shown at Artropolis, [[Chicago]].
In 2011, it was shown at [[Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts|PICA]], Perth, Australia, [[Ivorypress]], Madrid, Spain, and [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]].

==Analysis==
The 3D "hyperreal" portraits depict beautiful landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063628/IRE_280_008.html|title=Dust Storm (Manter, Kansas)|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Dust Storm unites a classic image from the Great Depression with a contemporary industrial landscape, setting them in a cosmological orbit that is completed over the full spectrum of a year. The exploitation of oil that goes back to the beginning of the 20th Century is presented as the catalyst of conditions that led to the ecological disaster of Dust Bowl. But nothing is didactic. The pity in the subject comes to viewers subliminally through a visual poem of complexity and power.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-04-26/features/0804250596_1_folk-and-outsider-art-dust-storm-galleries&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5606">'''Employee experience design''' ('''EED or EXD''') is the application of [[experience design]] in order to intentionally designing [[Human resources|HR]] products, services, events, and organizational environments with a focus on the quality of the employee [[experience]] and organizationally relevant solutions.

==Overview==

EED can be described as the "intentional design of the active or passive use of HR products or services",&lt;ref name="Menzel-Black &amp; Völkl"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Menzel-Black, C.|author2=Völkl, C.|title=Nach Bedarf designt|journal=Personalmagazin|year=2014|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christin_Menzel/publication/264310054_Nach_Bedarf_designt/links/53d7f23a0cf2631430bfdcad?ev=pub_ext_doc_dl&amp;origin=publication_detail&amp;inViewer=true|doi=10.13140/2.1.3054.4001|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and employee experiences in general, that affect employees' emotional reaction and therefore their particular behaviors and loyalty.&lt;ref name="Pullmann &amp; Gross"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pullman, M. E.|author2=Gross, M. A.|year=2014|title=Ability of Experience Design Elements to Elicit Emotions and Loyalty Behaviors|journal=Decision Sciences|volume=35|issue=3|pages=551–578|doi=10.1111/j.0011-7315.2004.02611.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0011-7315.2004.02611.x/full|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying assumption is that best (customer/employee) relationships are emotional in nature and achieved when companies succeed in not only satisfying certain needs (e.g. compensation), but also making interactions pleasurable.&lt;ref name="Pullmann &amp; Gross"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pine &amp; Gilmore"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pine, J.|author2=Gilmore, J.|title=The Experience Economy|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston|year=1998|url=http://hbr.org/1998/07/welcome-to-the-experience-economy/|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal is to yield better [[customer experience]] through increased [[employee engagement]] and employee [[empowerment]].&lt;ref name="Ramaswamy"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ramaswamy, V.|year=2009|title=Leading the transformation to co‐creation of value|journal=Strategy &amp; Leadership|volume=37|issue=2|pages=32–37|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/10878570910941208|doi=10.1108/10878570910941208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Krippendorf, EED focuses on creating meaningful and sense-making opportunities for engagement,&lt;ref name="Krippendorf"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krippendorff, K.|year=1989|title=On the essential contexts of artifacts or on the proposition that" design is making sense (of things)|journal=Design Issues|volume=5|number=2|pages=9–39|jstor=1511512|doi=10.2307/1511512}}&lt;/ref&gt; and addressing aspirational &lt;ref name="Ramaswamy" /&gt; and fundamental psychological needs of an employee, such as autonomy, competence and relatedness.&lt;ref name="Sheldon"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sheldon, K. M.|author2=Elliot, A. J.|author3=Kim, Y.|author4=Kasser, T.|year=2001|title=What is satisfying about satisfying events? Testing 10 candidate psychological needs|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=80|issue=2|page=325|pmid=11220449|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.2.325|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

Related to [[design strategy]], EED is a participatory systems approach to workplace improvements that applies methods and principles of [[experience design]], such as [[design thinking]], [[co-creation]] and [[empathic design]].&lt;ref name="Menzel-Black &amp; Völkl" /&gt; It also uses tools and techniques that are typical to [[customer experience management]] and [[service design]], e.g. employee experience journey mapping&lt;ref name="Oracle"&gt;{{cite web|author=Oracle Human Capital Management|year=2014|title=An Employee Centric Approach To HR – Employee Experience Journey Mapping (EXJM)|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/employee-centric-hr-2203095.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[touchpoint]] analysis.

Primary design object is the employee experience, which – when successful – an employee finds unique, memorable and sustainable over time, would want to repeat and build upon, and enthusiastically promotes via word of mouth.&lt;ref name="Pine &amp; Gilmore" /&gt; It is suspected to encourage loyalty by creating an emotional connection through engaging, compelling, and consistent context.&lt;ref name="Pullmann &amp; Gross" /&gt; The categories for employee experience design context are products, processes, artefacts, content, space and interactions.&lt;ref name="Menzel-Black &amp; Völkl" /&gt;

==Stakeholders==
[[Human resource management]], operating across hierarchies and departments, plays a central role in design, distribution and delivery of EED. As co-creation is an important design principle, it is a shared task and joint responsibility of leadership, HR professionals and employees.&lt;ref name="Menzel-Black &amp; Völkl" /&gt; Following the logic of the [[service-profit chain]], beneficiaries are also customers, as the recipients of improved service quality and the organization itself through increased profits.&lt;ref name="Heskett"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Heskett, J. L.|author2=Schlesinger, L. A. |year=1994|title=Putting the service-profit chain to work|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=72|issue=2|pages=164–174|url=http://www.tgli.cl/students/intranet/content/Lecturas/Putting%20the%20Service-Profit%20Cahin%20to%20work.pdf|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Interzone''''' is a collection of unpublished short stories and other early works by [[William S. Burroughs]] from 1953 to 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/william-s-burroughs/interzone/|title=INTERZONE by William S. Burroughs {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was first published by [[Viking Press|Viking Penguin]] in 1989, although several of the stories had already been printed elsewhere, including an earlier publication titled ''Early Routines''. The title was inspired by the [[Tangier International Zone|International Zone]] in [[Tangiers]], Morocco, where Burroughs lived for a time and by which he was greatly influenced.

A notable inclusion is "Twilight's Last Gleamings", written in 1938 in collaboration with childhood friend Kells Elvins, and widely thought to be Burroughs' first attempt at fiction. The villain of the piece, Doctor Benway, was to play a pivotal role in ''[[Naked Lunch]]''. (This story differs from another Burroughs piece titled "Twilight's Last Gleamings," which was published in the 1970s collection, ''[[Exterminator!]]''.)

''Interzone'' features many characters and concepts that would manifest themselves in ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', ''[[Nova Express]]'' and others. At one point, Interzone was considered as a title for ''[[Naked Lunch]]''. Moreover, the concluding section entitled "WORD" was part of the original ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' manuscript but was cut during the editing process (according to the introduction by editor [[James Grauerholz]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/257582.Interzone|title=Interzone|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the short pieces were adapted into other media. Burroughs recorded the stories "[[The Junky's Christmas]]" and "Spare Ass Annie," which were set to music and released on the album ''[[Spare Ass Annie and Other Tales]]''. "[[The Junky's Christmas]]" was also adapted as an animated film in the 1990s.

'''Isaac Sailmaker''' (born '''Isaac Zeilmaker'''  in [[Scheveningen]], 1633; died in [[London]] on June 28, 1721) was a Dutch marine painter active in Britain. He came to London to work for [[George Geldorp]] and later worked for [[Oliver Cromwell]]. He is known for paintings of ships and lighthouses.

'''Juice Rap News''' is an internet based satirical news show, created in [[Melbourne, Australia]] by [[The Juice Media]]. The show was the creation of a duo, Hugo Farrant and Giordano Nanni, based in Australia and consists of a rapped "news report" with [[social commentary]] using comical rap lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hickman |first=Leo |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/nov/26/al-gore-lord-monckton-rap-battle |title=Al Gore and Lord Monckton go head-to-head over climate in spoof video rap battle &amp;#124; Environment |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is known for using [[satire]] and [[rap]] rhyming to analyse important topics of the day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ludlam|first=Scott|title=Senator Ludlam on whistleblowers, democracy, Bradley Manning, Wikileaks, PRISM and Edward Snowden|url=http://scott-ludlam.greensmps.org.au/content/speeches-parliament/senator-ludlam-whistleblowers-democracy-bradley-manning-wikileaks-prism-}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a humorous, yet philosophical fashion. Juice Rap News is distributed via YouTube. Some episodes were licensed to the international television news channel [[RT (TV Network)|RT]] for rebroadcast.&lt;ref name="thejuicemedia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thejuicemedia.com/the-big-news-for-rap-news-in-2014/ |title=The big news for Rap News in 2014 &amp;#124; Juice Rap News |publisher=Thejuicemedia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience of Juice Rap News is international and episodes have been translated into more than 20 languages. 35 episodes were produced in total, plus a video announcing that the 35th episode was the final they would produce. However in September 2016, due to audience demand, Giordano Nanni produced a special episode for that year's [[United States presidential election, 2016|United States presidential election]], and announced that the series would continue to produce content from time to time, with a new crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thejuicemedia.com/hillary-clinton-vs-donald-trump-juice-rap-news-special-edition/|title=Hillary Clinton vs Donald Trump - JUICE RAP NEWS (Special Edition) - The Juice Media|date=2016-09-19|work=The Juice Media|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanni and Farrant co-wrote and produced the series together in their home studio in Melbourne, Australia. Nanni focused on content (crafting the arguments, narrative and perspectives depicted and explored in the show); while Farrant focused on form (giving the dialogue the "rhyme and flow" of rap and performing the vocals of most of the characters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaroots.org/the-minds-behind-rap-news/ |title=MR Original – The Minds Behind Rap News &amp;#124; MEDIA ROOTS – Reporting From Outside Party Lines |publisher=Mediaroots.org |date=2010-11-30 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrant portrayed the [[News anchor|anchor]] Robert Foster and a host of other characters, including the regulars General Baxter and Terrence Moonseed. Nanni also appeared in the show, portraying many characters, such as Aussie correspondent Ken Oathcarn, "MSMBS" host Brian Washington, PR host Ivan Sakamunev, Bill de Berg and George Torwell, all using vox by Hugo Farrant. The goal was to provide an alternative view on world events, one that they felt was lacking in popular media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xT7Eo_2n0xY |title=Rap News: The juice is loose |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/juice-news-termination-economy-301/ |title=Juice News on RT: Termination of economy — RT News |publisher=Rt.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in Episode 20, Assange gets a "makeover" by Ken Oathcarn, donning a mullet wig, singing [[John Farnham|John Farnham's]] "[[You're the Voice]]" recorded in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where Assange is currently receiving political asylum.

==Controversies==

Rap News 20 caused controversy when it was released during the [[2013 Australian Federal Election]]. Most of the controversy surrounded Julian Assange's appearance in the episode. The character Ken Oathcarn (played by Nanni) convinces Assange that if he is to be successful in his election bid for a Senate seat, he is in need of a make-over. Assange dons a flannel shirt, a blonde mullet wig and a fake Australian flag tattoo, and proceeds to sing a parody of John Farnham’s "You’re The Voice." The video went viral soon after being posted online. It also featured on [[The Chaser]]'s 2013 Federal Election coverage&lt;ref&gt;The Hamster Decides: Episode 3. 2013. TV broadcast. Australian Broadcasting Commission, 28 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ten's [[The Project (Australian TV program)|The Project]].&lt;ref&gt;The Project. TV broadcast. Ten Network, 26 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The offending scene was filmed in London's Ecuadorian Embassy where Assange has remained since seeking political asylum on 19 June 2012, which he was granted in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Irene Caselli in Quito |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/14/julian-assange-asylum-ecuador-wikileaks |title=Julian Assange will be granted asylum, says official &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Rap News went viral, Assange was publicly chastised for his appearance in the video by Ecuadorian President [[Rafael Correa]], who said,

:"We have sent him a letter: he can campaign politically, but without making fun of Australian politicians. We are not going to allow that. The rules of asylum in principle forbid meddling in the politics of the country that grants asylum. But as a matter of courtesy we are not going to bar Julian Assange from exercising his right to be a candidate. Just so long as he doesn't make fun of Australian politicians or people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-31/ecuador-leader-rebukes-assange-for-mocking-australian-politicia/4926586 |title=Ecuador president Rafael Correa rebukes Julian Assange for mocking Australian politicians - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2013-08-31 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the first public indication of any friction between Assange and his Ecuadorian hosts.

Furthermore, many major media outlets failed to recognise Rap News 20 as satire, calling it a "campaign video," in what Farrant and Nanni described as "true to form."&lt;ref name="blogs.abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/queensland/2013/08/making-over-julian-assange-and-the-media-making-up-the-facts.html?site=goldcoast |title=Making over Julian Assange and the media making up the facts - ABC Queensland - Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) |publisher=Blogs.abc.net.au |date=2013-08-28 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ABC Radio, the duo addressed the controversy and confusion, saying,

:"In the world of the internet parody culture, what we’re doing is accepted and most people and most of the comments on the video and on Twitter and Facebook are overwhelmingly positive. It’s no surprise that once things are taken out of context and brought into the world, of, you know, the considerably more sober world of the mainstream media, these out of context quotes can be portrayed as offensive…We don’t really engage with that audience. Our audience is on the internet. We really pride ourselves on making an internet show and we’re trying to get people away from the more conventional, centralised, one-way media model, such as, basically, the traditional media. We love the fact that people can watch the video, post comments, we reply to comments, it’s a two way dialogue, it’s a totally different culture".&lt;ref name="blogs.abc.net.au"/&gt;

On 14 September 2013, Farrant and Nanni notified viewers that a copyright claim had been filled against the video for the parodic use of Farnham's "You're the Voice", despite protection for parody and satire under Part III: 41A and Part IV: 103AA of the Australian Copyright Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013C00145 |title=Copyright Act 1968 |publisher=Comlaw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October 2013, the duo uploaded a version without the parody, as an agreement with copyright holders had not been reached.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20131120144223/https://www.facebook.com/rapnews/posts/10152314205263452 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with RT network ==

Five episodes from the first season of Rap News were licensed to be distributed by [[RT (TV Network)|RT]] via their website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/shows/juice-news-robert-foster/ |title=Juice News — RT Shows |publisher=Rt.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325100618/http://rt.com/shows/juice-news-robert-foster/ |archivedate=25 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and YouTube channel.

In January 2014 the producers of Rap News confirmed ten episodes from Season 2 would be licensed to RT for broadcast on both RT's television and YouTube channels.&lt;ref name="thejuicemedia1"/&gt;

A brief excerpt about [[Bitcoin]] from Rap News 21 (The News) featured in episode 555 of The Keiser Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q684UxfDSU |title=Keiser Report: MaxCoin (E555) |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-01-28 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; a financial program presented by [[Max Keiser]] and [[Stacy Herbert]] which is broadcast on [[RT America]].

==Reception==
As of November 2017, the YouTube channel hosting Rap News has received more than 17 million total video views; additionally the channel has over 118,000 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/thejuicemedia/about |title=thejuicemedia |website=YouTube |date=n.d. |accessdate=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rap News has been warmly received by organisations that advocate whistle-blowing including [[WikiLeaks]] and The Kindle Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kindleproject.org/juice-rap-news |title=Juice Rap News |publisher=Kindle Project |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rap News videos—either individually, or as a whole series—have been featured on a large number of esoteric and fringe-view websites.

=== Rap News 5 (The War on Journalism) ===
Rap News 5 was 'video of the week' on an edition of Al-Jazeera's ''[[The Listening Post]]'', which aired on 27 November 2010. A heavily edited version of RN5 (lasting just over 60 seconds) played out the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onFUapLAJNI |title=The Midterms Media Players - The Listening Post (Full) |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-11-06 |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rap News 15 (Big Brother is WWWatching You) ===
In a very brief article, Michael Kelly of ''[[Business Insider]]'' wrote about Rap News, saying "This Australian website calls out the immense rise in US domestic surveillance" and went on to describe the Rap News 15 segment as "informative and entertaining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/this-juice-rap-news-segment-nails-the-terrifying-rise-of-the-us-surveillance-state-2012-9 |title=This Juice Rap News Segment Nails The Terrifying Rise Of The US Surveillance State |publisher=Business Insider |date=2012-09-10 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rap News 15 also came to the attention of American cryptographer and security expert [[Bruce Schneier]], who posted a link to the video on his website, accompanied with text simply stating: "wow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/10/rap_news_on_int.html |title=Schneier on Security: Rap News on Internet Surveillance |publisher=Schneier.com |date=2012-10-30 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rap News 19 (Whistleblower) ===

Australian Senator [[Scott Ludlam]] quoted verbatim a small excerpt from Rap News 19 to conclude a speech he was making in the Australian Senate regarding whistle-blowers. The exact portion he quoted was "Whistleblowers; they leak in the public interest. Now what remains to be known is - is the public interested? If so, this might be a good day to exhibit it! Ignorance is a choice, in the age of the internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn8MIGHR__0 |title=Senator Ludlam on whistleblowers, democracy, Bradley Manning and Edward Snowdon |publisher=YouTube |date=2013-06-19 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club''' ('''La MaMa E.T.C.''') is an [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theatre founded in 1961 by [[Ellen Stewart]], [[African Americans|African-American]] theatre director, producer, and fashion designer. Located in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], the theatre began in the basement boutique where Stewart sold her fashion designs. Stewart turned the space into a theatre at night, focusing on the work of young playwrights. La MaMa has evolved during its fifty-year history into a world-renowned cultural institution.

==Background==
Stewart started La MaMa as a theatre dedicated to the playwright and primarily producing new plays, including works by [[Paul Foster (playwright)|Paul Foster]], [[Jean-Claude van Itallie]], [[Lanford Wilson]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Adrienne Kennedy]], [[Harvey Fierstein]], and [[Rochelle Owens]]. La MaMa also became an international ambassador for [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theatre by touring downtown theatre abroad during the 1960s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;Bottoms, Steven J. ''Playing Underground: A Critical History of the 1960s Off-Off-Broadway Movement''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

La MaMa is the only theatre of the 1960s Off-Off-Broadway movement's four core theatres that continues to thrive today.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;  The other three Off-Off-Broadway theatres that composed this core included [[Joe Cino]]'s [[Caffe Cino]], [[Al Carmines]]' [[Judson Poets Theatre]], and Ralph Cook's [[Theatre Genesis]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003" /&gt; More than any other Off-Off-Broadway producer, Stewart reached out beyond the East Village, forcing rather than following new trends in theatre and performance.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;

To the present, La MaMa's mission is dedicated to "the people who make art, and it is to them that we give our support with free theatre and rehearsal space, lights, sound, props, platforms, and whatever else we have that they can use to create their work. We want them to feel free to explore their ideas, and translate them into a theatrical language that can communicate to any person in any part of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lamama.org/|title=La MaMa {{!}} Theatre in the East Village, NYC|website=La MaMa|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beginnings: Ellen Stewart and the pushcart ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ellen Stewart is the spirit of La MaMa; she is its guardian, janitor, fund raiser, press agent, tour manager, conceptual leader—she is the guts of the place. To understand this theatre one must first know Ellen Stewart.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1972"&gt;Poland, Albert, &amp; Mailman, Bruce (editors). ''The Off Off Broadway Book: The Plays, People, Theatres''. New York: Bobbs-Merrill Company Inc., 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stewart worked as a fashion designer at [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] before starting the theatre. Stewart was inspired by her mentor, "Papa Abraham Diamonds," who owned a fabric shop on the [[Lower East Side]]. Diamonds told Stewart that everyone needs both a "pushcart to serve others" and their own personal pushcart. Stewart had a revelation about this advice during a trip she took to Morocco and decided to open a boutique for her fashion designs that would also serve as a theatre for her foster brother, playwright Fred Lights, and his fellow playwright [[Paul Foster (playwright)|Paul Foster]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Crespy, David A. ''Off-Off-Broadway Explosion: How Provocative Playwrights of the 1960s Ignited a New American Theater''.  New York: Back Stage Books, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 18, 1961, Stewart paid the fifty-five dollar rent on a tenement basement at 321 East Ninth Street to start her boutique and theater.

== As an Off-Off-Broadway theatre ==

===A theatre for the playwright===
As opposed to [[Caffe Cino]], which was focused on creating a specific atmosphere or clientele, La MaMa's primary focus was on the playwright. Stewart was interested in the people behind the work, and often didn't even read the plays. She relied on what she called "beeps," or "clicks," a hunch or feeling she got when meeting people and deciding whether or not to produce work with them.

In the early years, Stewart housed and fed playwrights and directors whenever possible.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Rosenthal, Cindy.  
"Ellen Stewart: La MaMa of Us All." ''TDR: The Drama Review'', Volume 50, Number 2 (T190), Summer 2006: 28-32.  Retrieved from Project Muse. Columbia University Library, November 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She acted as a mother; [[Jean-Claude van Itallie]] remembers his first meeting with Stewart:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I never could have expected the warmth of Ellen's milk. She basically said to me, "Honey, you're home. This space is for you to put on plays." The combination of her kindness and her smile and the beauty of the space were overwhelming ... Ellen broadcast to the world that we were doing something important. We were her baby playwrights and she sat on us like eggs that would hatch. She told us that what we were doing mattered, and we wouldn't get confirmation on that anywhere else.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1997 interview, Stewart echoed this sentiment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I call them my kids. I'm very fortunate. They know they can come to see me whenever they want. They don't need to have appointments. And they call me on the phone from all over the world. I'd be a zero without my kids. They stay with me, and many have been very fortunate in their later careers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;Anderson, George W. "Visiting La MaMa's Founder: An Interview with Ellen Stewart." Online. February 1997: 28-32. Retrieved from ProQuest. Columbia University Library, November 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not only did Stewart create a nurturing environment for the playwright, but La MaMa's space itself was an appealing blank canvas in its early years. van Itallie said of the space, "it imposed no aesthetic, made no artistic suggestions."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; For this among other reasons, La MaMa was considered by many playwrights to be the most inviting of the Off-Off-Broadway theatres.

In 1963, Stewart created a policy of exclusively presenting new plays, producing a new play each week.
&lt;ref name=horn /&gt; She also began ringing a bell before each production, welcoming the audience with, 
"Welcome to La MaMa dedicated to the playwright and all aspects of the theatre. Tonight we present ..."&lt;ref name=horn /&gt;

Stewart believed that young playwrights needed the ability to explore without the fear of professional criticism too early in their career, and that new playwrights shouldn't be critiqued in the same way as more experienced playwrights.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; Stewart said that playwrights who didn't feel they had the experience to make work at Caffe Cino would come to La MaMa instead.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt; By producing their work, Stewart was creating a space for new playwrights to learn from practical, collaborative experiences.

=== La MaMa and Caffe Cino ===
Stewart did not believe that her theater was an imitation of Cino's.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; Cino and Stewart had a close relationship, and the first documented production at La MaMa, (''One Arm'', July 27, 1962, an adaptation of a Tennessee Williams story, transferred from Caffe Cino.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; Perhaps the best way to understand Cino and Stewart's relationship is to consider their different models of producing plays. Cino rarely extended a run, as he didn't want to affect the next play's opening. If playwrights wanted longer runs and more exposure for a popular play, they went to La MaMa. There was an unspoken agreement between Cino and Stewart that the plays produced at either theatre could continue to a second run at the other. When Caffe Cino burned down in 1966, La MaMa hosted benefit shows to aid in the theatre's reopening. Joe Cino's family offered Stewart the theatre after his death in 1967, but she declined.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

== Early history ==

=== 321 E. 9th Street: Café La MaMa ===
La MaMa's first home, the basement at 321 East Ninth Street, was renovated over a period of nine months. During this time, the neighbors became concerned about the different men visiting at various times to work on the space. Moreover, as an African-American woman, Stewart was not welcomed into the neighborhood. Barbara Lee Horn writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, number 321 had been an all white building, and the tenants liked it that way. Further provoked by the comings and goings, they accused Stewart of running a bordello—fifteen men in one hour—and asked the health department to issue a summons for prostitution.&lt;ref name=horn&gt;Horn, Barbara Lee. ''Ellen Stewart and La MaMa: A Bio-Bibliography''. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1993''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The health department was contacted, but the inspector who arrived happened to be an old [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]]. He advised Stewart that getting a license to open a coffeehouse was much easier than getting a license to open a theatre. Following this advice, La MaMa became Café La MaMa. Coffee and cake were served, admission was free, and any compensation that the actors received came from "passing the hat."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; Stewart's fashion designs and seamstress jobs subsidized the theatre during its first decade of operation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;

The first space was twenty by thirty feet with earthy red walls.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; The café sat twenty-five people and the dirt floor was planked with orange crates.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1972"/&gt; There was one set piece: a bed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; Stewart's initial intention of using the space as a boutique during the daytime quickly disappeared. As Stewart said, "Once our theatre got started, I didn't have the discipline to sew. I was too busy doing other things &amp;ndash; not writing or directing &amp;ndash; but just doing theatre."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; The plays ran for one week, from Wednesday-Saturday, and major theatre critics did not come.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;

Even operating as a "café," Café La MaMa was forced to close and reopen ten times during its first year. Although the neighbors' fears concerning Stewart's supposed brothel had been quelled, fire inspectors often found violations at the theatre, which created serious legal problems. Stewart herself was arrested twice, and several other times under another alias.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; Issues with fire-code violations at Café La MaMa's first basement location led Stewart to search for a new space. In 1963, the Café was closed by the Buildings Department due to a zoning violation.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt;

=== 82 2nd Avenue: La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club ===
Café La MaMa moved into its second home, a loft above a florist shop at 82&amp;nbsp;Second Avenue, on June 28, 1963.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; One month after opening, Stewart was informed by the Buildings Department that she had to vacate this new space because she was making a profit from serving coffee. Stewart stopped serving coffee and began charging an admission of fifty cents.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt;

On March 12, 1964, Café La MaMa was officially renamed La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club (La MaMa E.T.C). The "passing of the hat" ended with this transition from café to a members-only club.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; Even operating as a club, this space was often visited by civic authorities, frequently interrupting performances.

This second space was approximately five times larger than the first space and sat up to seventy-four people. The ceilings were twenty by fifty feet high and there was a one-step stage that was twenty by eight feet. 82 Second Avenue is where La MaMa E.T.C. truly became a theater.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt; During this time, playwrights [[Lanford Wilson]] and [[Sam Shepard]] began producing plays at La MaMa.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1972"/&gt; This was also where Stewart started her tradition of sitting outside on La MaMa's steps during performances to ensure that civic authorities didn't interrupt.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt;

Because of building code violations, La MaMa was forced to relocate again in November 1964. All of these relocations were initiated by the Buildings Department inspector, who would contact the Fire Department, who would then contact the Police Department to issue a summons for Stewart's arrest.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt; In order to avoid a third [[conviction]], which would have made her a [[Felony|felon]], Stewart moved La MaMa to a new space with the audience's help. Stewart recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was the closing performance of ''Balls'', Paul Foster's play. There must have been 35 people who came to see the play. Many of them had never been there before, I told them just to strike the café. Many didn't know what I meant, but they all saw the others picking up chairs and tables. Everybody picked something up and followed me down the street. We took everything, paintings, tables, chairs, coffeepots—everything. Well, they moved me in one hour.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The audience followed Stewart to the second floor of 122&amp;nbsp;Second Avenue, La MaMa's third home.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt;

=== 122 2nd Avenue ===
On November 11, 1964, La MaMa E.T.C. opened at 122&amp;nbsp;Second Avenue with David Novak's ''The Wedding Panda''. This space was twenty-three by seventy-five feet with a twelve-foot ceiling; the stage at the back was twenty-three by ten feet. The seating capacity was technically seventy-four, but the theatre would often fit 115 people at a time.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt; This new, larger space attracted artists who had previously worked at other tiny Off-Off-Broadway venues but were ready for a larger space. [[Lanford Wilson]]'s ''[[Balm in Gilead]]'', which needed a stage that could accommodate twenty-five people, and was also the first full-length play written for off-off Broadway, opened at 122 Second Avenue in January 1965.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;

Partially due to previous legal struggles, the performances at 122&amp;nbsp;Second Avenue were primarily publicized by word of mouth. The theatre had no sign; the street-level door was labeled "122 Delivery Entrance."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; There were weekly listings of the productions in the ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'', but an address or a phone number was never listed. Only members could attend, and one had to visit 122 2nd Avenue in person to become a member. By 1967, La MaMa E.T.C. had an estimated three thousand members.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; La MaMa E.T.C. officially became a [[nonprofit organization]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt;

La MaMa remained at this third location until 1967. This period was crucial to La MaMa's establishment and audience development.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; La MaMa moved for a final time when the lease on 122 2nd Avenue expired in April 1968.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt;

=== 74A E. 4th Street ===
The second floor at [[St. Mark's Place (Manhattan)|St. Mark's Place]] served as a transitional space for La MaMa from January through March 1969. On April 2, 1969, Stewart purchased the building at 74A East 4th Street using grant money from the [[Ford Foundation|Ford]], [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]], and [[Doris Duke Foundation|Doris Duke]] Foundations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1972"/&gt;

The ground floor of 74A E. 4th is a theatre which seats one hundred people. Originally called the La Mama Repertory Theatre, the theatre is now called the First Floor Theatre. The second-floor space is a cabaret called the La MaMa Experimental Club with the capacity to seat seventy-five.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; With additional funding, the third floor became a rehearsal space and workshop. Finally, the top floor was turned into an apartment for Stewart. In 1970, a decaying seven-story loft building at 47 Great Jones Street was purchased for additional rehearsal space, using money from the Ford Foundation.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt;
In 1974, La MaMa purchased 66 E. 4th Street, which is two doors down from 74A E. 4th.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt; Initially referred to as the Annex, 66 E. 4th includes a flexible theatre space with a seating capacity of 299 as well as an upper floor dormitory for visiting artists. This space had previously served as a forty-eight by one hundred feet television soundstage with thirty-footy high ceilings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; In 2009, the Annex was renamed the Ellen Stewart Theatre.

== International presence and influence ==
To date, La MaMa has presented and produced work by artists from over seventy nations.

=== Early European tours ===
While frequently moving locations in Manhattan, La MaMa was also traveling internationally. Stewart wanted broad publicity for her playwrights but she wasn't finding this in the United States, due partially to La MaMa's "hit or miss quality" and partially to the short runs of productions. Critics also found it difficult to determine the "dedicated devotion to novelty" of La MaMa productions.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt;
Upon hearing that Danish and other European countries would review most productions seen in their cities, Stewart decided to establish a reputation in Europe so that the United States would take more notice.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt; In the fall of 1965, with twenty-two plays and sixteen young actors, La MaMa had its first European tour.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt;

La MaMa had two traveling companies. The first company, headed by [[Tom O'Horgan]], went to Copenhagen for six weeks and was well-received. The Danish audience was interested in the company's passion and energy, and La MaMa was invited back the following year. The other company, led by Ross Alexander, went to Paris for six weeks. Unfortunately, the French audience found Jean-Claude van Itallie's ''[[America Hurrah]]'' obscene and the reviews were negative. Still, this first tour achieved its goal; La MaMa returned to New York with several positive Danish reviews.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt; La MaMa had its second European tour from September–December 1966, again with O'Horgan and with ten actors. A third European tour took place from June–November 1967.

=== Cultural ambassador ===
The La MaMa companies did not only bring La MaMa plays to Europe but also brought plays that were first presented at other Off-Off-Broadway venues. These included ''[[Home Free!]]'', ''[[The Madness of Lady Bright]]'', and ''Miss. Victoria'' from Caffe Cino, as well as ''[[Birdbath]]'' and ''Chicago'' from Theatre Genesis. Thus, La MaMa acted as "international ambassadors, not just for La MaMa, but for new Village playwriting generally."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;

La MaMa has extended past these European tours, with satellite La MaMa theatres opening over the years in Boston, Amsterdam, Bogotá, Israel, London, Melbourne, Morocco, Munich, Paris, Tokyo, Toronto, and Vienna.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1972"/&gt; As of 2006, only a few continued to carry the La MaMa name, including La MaMa Bogotá, La MaMa Tel Aviv, and [[La Mama Theatre (Melbourne)|La MaMa Melbourne]].

These tours and satellite theatres not only created international connections and established La MaMa as a cultural ambassador for Off-Off-Broadway theatre, but also introduced experimental playwriting and O'Horgan's style of directing to international audiences. The La MaMa tours also allowed Stewart to create cross-cultural exchanges. She brought many notable international artists to La MaMa in Manhattan, including the Polish director [[Jerzy Grotowski]] in 1969 and the Romanian director [[Andrei Serban]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="horn" /&gt;

Stewart also created site-specific productions internationally. In 1981, she directed ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' on the grounds of [[Schloss Leopoldskron|Leopoldskran Castle]] in [[Salzburg, Austria]]. In 2004, she directed ''[[Trojan Women]]'' at the ruins in [[Gardzienice|Gardzienice, Poland]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006" /&gt;

La MaMa Umbria, in [[Spoleto|Spoleto, Italy]], is an artist's retreat and cultural center founded in 1990 by Stewart with her [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Grant]] money. Since 2000, La MaMa has held a three-week international symposium for directors at the Umbria location.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006" /&gt;

== From playwright to director ==
The European tours influenced Stewart's own aesthetic: "I learned in 1965, that English is not the beginning and end of anything. Generally, it's the ending, it messes you up." She also said that, "I found the plays that were the most visual were the ones people liked."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; These realizations shifted Stewart's primary interest from the playwright to the director. In the 1970s, Stewart was interested in pairing playwrights and directors as a kind of theatrical matchmaker. She also had an interest in playwrights who directed and/or were solo performers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; Stewart's 1970s shift in focus aligned with the concurrent historical "end" of the original Off-Off-Broadway movement. While La MaMa is the only Off-Off-Broadway theatre of the core four Off-Off-Broadway theatres that continues to function, La MaMa has evolved and adapted beyond Stewart's original focus on the playwright.

=== Tom O'Horgan: first artistic director ===
In 1964, [[Tom O'Horgan]] joined La MaMa. Directing over sixty plays, including his all-male version of [[Jean Genet]]'s ''[[The Maids]]'', O'Horgan was crucial to La MaMa's development. He was the theatre's first Artistic Director and was also integral to La MaMa's international tours.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt; As a musician, O'Horgan performed with the [[Chicago Civic Opera]] in his youth and had professional training as a harpist, and was also trained in ballet.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; He came to La MaMa from [[The Second City|Second City]], bringing his interest and knowledge of [[Viola Spolin]] and [[Paul Sills]]' role-playing theories of human behavior and games adapted for theatre.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt; This background gave O'Horgan an interest in the totality of theatre, which aligned perfectly with Stewart's interest in a theatrical language that transcended text. This interest of Stewart's developed primarily from La MaMa's international touring. O'Horgan's direction included musically driven vocal and movement techniques, which contributed to the distinctive La MaMa genre of theatre.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

=== The La MaMa Troupe ===
O'Horgan and Stewart decided to create a workshop to develop the particular type of actors needed for La MaMa's productions. O'Horgan went on to direct the La MaMa Troupe from 1965 to 1969.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; This decision was initiated by the experience of working on ''Three from La MaMa'' with [[National Educational Television]]. ''Three from La MaMa'' was a television program of three La MaMa theatre pieces: ''Pavane'' by [[Jean-Claude van Itallie]]; ''Fourteen Hundred Thousand'' by [[Sam Shepard]]; and ''The Recluse'' by [[Paul Foster (playwright)|Paul Foster]].&lt;ref name=horn /&gt;  The executive director of National Educational Television, Brice Howard, would not allow any La MaMa actors to perform in ''Three from La MaMa''. Howard declared that the La MaMa actors were too inexperienced, which led Stewart and O'Horgan to start the actor-training workshop.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

In comparison to the psychological acting style and emphasis on [[method acting]] that was popular at the time, the La MaMa workshop focused on the other side of acting: externalized, kinetic techniques. The fifteen members of the La MaMa Troupe had workshops in movement, voice, and acting for five hours a day, five days a week.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt; These workshops included hundreds of different exercises, which are best represented by ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]],'' a La MaMa show that transferred to Broadway in 1968. ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic Michael Smith wrote on ''Hair'''s Broadway opening: "O'Horgan has blown up Broadway." ''Hair'' brought international acclaim to O'Horgan and the La MaMa performance style.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;

For some of the actors in the La MaMa troupe, O'Horgan's ''Hair'' was a "betrayal" and a "crass commercialization of lovingly developed ensemble techniques."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004" /&gt; The success of ''Hair'' affected La MaMa's identity, as did O'Horgan's frequent lack of availability to direct later productions. O'Horgan left La MaMa in 1969.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;

== Actors' Equity and the showcase code ==
More experienced actors began to work at La MaMa as its reputation grew, creating problems with the [[Actors' Equity Association]]. In 1966, the union refused to allow their members to work at La MaMa without contracts. As a result, La MaMa was forced to shut down from October 12, 1966, until November 9, 1966.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt;

Equity believed that since La MaMa did not pay its actors the theatre was competing with [[Off-Broadway]] and would have to shut down. Peter Feldman, an Off-Off-Broadway director, wrote into the ''[[New York Times]]'' disputing Equity's reasoning. He wrote that La MaMa "did provide a stimulating environment for actors to work" and that working at La MaMa often led to paying jobs for actors when productions got transferred to Off-Broadway or [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Feldman also emphasized that Stewart was not a commercial producer, but the head of a not-for-profit theatre, and was thus being considered unfairly.&lt;ref name=horn /&gt;

After a hearing with Stewart, the union resolved the conflict by creating a new showcase code. As long as La MaMa remained a private club, Equity actors could perform without contracts. This code still applies to Off-Off-Broadway productions today.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

== In the 2000s ==
In 2005, the theatre was among 406 [[New York City]] arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnegie.org/sub/news/anon2005.html "Carnegie Corporation of New York Announces Twenty Million Dollars in New York City Grants"]. {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QW4N2XUy?url=http://carnegie.org/sub/news/anon2005.html|date=July 22, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; made possible by a donation from then-[[mayor of New York City]], [[Michael Bloomberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Sam. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/nyregion/06donate.html?ex=1278302400&amp;en=93a1beabd4ede5b8&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss "City Groups Get Bloomberg Gift of $20 Million"]. ''[[New York Times]],'' July 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, over one hundred productions with over four hundred performances are staged at La MaMa each season. Stewart continued to be artistic director and "mother" at La MaMa until her death on January 13, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, Mel, &amp; Weber, Bruce.[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/theater/14stewart.html "Ellen Stewart, 91, Off-Off-Broadway Pioneer, Dies"]. ''[[New York Times]],'' January 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of who would follow Stewart was significant, as "Ellen is La MaMa"&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; to many people. Before her death, Stewart chose to be succeeded by Mia Yoo, who continues to serve as artistic director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/theater/mia-yoo-steps-into-ellen-stewarts-shoes-at-la-mama.html|title=A Downtown Icon's Nurturing Spirit|last=Zinoman|first=Jason|date=October 12, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==La MaMa Archives==
The [http://lamama.org/programs/archives/ La MaMa Archives] is a collection chronicling the theatre's history and documenting the development of Off-Off-Broadway theatre. The collection includes approximately 10,000 items in a range of formats, including posters, programs, scripts, costumes, puppets, masks, musical instruments, correspondence, photographs, and audiovisual materials. The Archives has developed a chronological [http://www.lamama.org/archives/year_lists/playlist.html list of productions] staged at La MaMa from 1962 through 2010, and in 2014 received a grant from the [[Council on Library and Information Resources]] to create a [http://catalog.lamama.org searchable digital catalog] of its collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clir.org/hiddencollections/awards/for-2013/|title=2013 Hidden Collections Funded Projects|last=|first=|date=|website=Council on Library and Information Resources|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Archives received a grant from the [https://www.archives.gov/nhprc National Historic Records and Publications Commission] to support a collaborative project, with the [[Bay Area Video Coalition]] and the [[Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research|Wisconsin Center for Film and Theatre Research]], that will result in expanded access to a collection of [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|half-inch open reel videos]] that document theatrical work performed at La MaMa during the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pushcartcatalog.wordpress.com/2017/09/07/nhprc-grant/|title=La MaMa's Archives Receives a Major Grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission|date=2017-09-07|work=Cataloging La MaMa's Pushcart Years|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:J.League officially licensed products.jpg|thumb|right]]

This is a list of soccer video games based on/licensed by the [[J. League]].

The first licensed game, ''[[J-League Fighting Soccer]]'', was released for the Game Boy on December 27, 1992. Two months later ''[[European Club Soccer|J-League Champion Soccer]]'' was released for the Mega Drive. ''[[J-League Greatest Eleven]]'' was released for the PC Engine a day before the start of the [[1993 J. League|inaugural season]].

Since then, other titles were released for many other platforms. Popular franchises include: ''Pro Striker'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/pro-striker-series ''Pro Striker'' series] at [[MobyGames]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[J.League Excite Stage (series)|Excite Stage]]'', ''[[J. League Soccer Prime Goal (series)|Prime Goal]]'', ''[[Sega Worldwide Soccer|Victory Goal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/sega-worldwide-soccer-victory-goal-series ''Victory Goal'' series] at MobyGames&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamefaqs.com/search/index.html?game=J.League+Victory+Goal ''J-League Victory Goal'' (Sega Saturn titles)] at [[GameFAQs]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[International Superstar Soccer|Perfect Striker]]'', ''[[:ja:プロサッカークラブをつくろう!|Pro Soccer Club o Tsukurou!]]'' and ''[[Winning Eleven]]''.

In 2002, Konami released ''Captain Tsubasa: Eikou no Kiseki'' for the Game Boy Advance, the only game from the ''[[Captain Tsubasa]]'' series which is licensed by J. League.

These games are based exclusively on the J. League, however the titles released more recently also contain other leagues.

The recent [[Pro Evolution Soccer|Winning Eleven]] titles (2012, 2013) are fully licensed by the J. League.

With [[EA Sports]] acquiring the license for the league for ''[[FIFA 17]]'', the J.League will make its first real appearance in a football game by Western developers.

'''Long-nosed god maskettes''' are [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] made from bone, [[copper]] and marine shells ([[Lightning whelk]]) associated with the [[Mississippian culture]] (800 to 1600 CE) and found in [[archaeological site]]s in the American Midwest and Southeast. They are small shield-shaped faces with squared-off foreheads, circular eyes, and large noses of various lengths. They are often shown on [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] representations of falcon impersonators as ear ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.museum.state.il.us/muslink/nat_amer/pre/htmls/miss.html|title=Native American:Prehistoric:Mississippian|accessdate=2010-07-30|publisher=Illinois State Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long and short nosed versions of the masks have been found in ten different states, with the majority found at sites in Illinois.&lt;ref name=LONG&amp;SHORT&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://lithiccastinglab.com/gallery-pages/2005octobergodmaskpage1.htm|title=Long &amp; Short Nosed God Masks|accessdate=2010-07-30|date=2005-09-30 |first=Peter A.|last= Bostrom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many archaeologists now associate them with the [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago) stories of the mythological being [[Red Horn (Siouan deity)|Red Horn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=War Paths, Peace Paths: An Archaeology of Cooperation and Conflict in Native Eastern North America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fegpXvByVnQC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=long-nosed+god+shell+maskettes&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rIBXTPapOIKB8gazwsW2BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=long-nosed%20god%20shell%20maskettes&amp;f=false|first=David H.|last=Dye|date=2009-02-16|publisher=AltaMira Press|isbn=978-0-7591-0745-8|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
[[File:Il maskette pike co nmai.jpg|thumb|left|A Long-nosed god maskette excavated from the [[Yokem Mound Group]] in [[Pike County, Illinois]], now in the [[National Museum of the American Indian|N.M.A.I.]]]]
The first long nosed god maskette was found next to a skull in a grave in Big Mound in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] in 1870. Since then over twenty of these artifacts have been discovered in an area encompassing at least ten states.&lt;ref name=DUNCAN2000&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20708122?uid=3739688&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=47698901849777|year=2000|volume=25|number=1|author1=Duncan, James R.|author2=Diaz-Granados, Carol|title=Of Masks and Myths}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been found in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wisconsin, but the majority have been found in Illinois.&lt;ref name=LONG&amp;SHORT/&gt; Excavations at the [[Gahagan Mounds Site]] in Louisiana in 1939 produced a matched pair of copper maskettes.&lt;ref name=TEJAS/&gt; The largest examples yet found were a pair of copper masks dug from a mound in [[Calhoun County, Illinois]] by William G.

===Long nosed god horizon===
Archaeologists have long used the maskettes for dating different phases of the Mississippian culture. In the 1950s [[Stephen Williams (archeologist)|Stephen Williams]] and [[John Mann Goggin]] proposed the existence of an early Mississippian ''Long nosed god horizon'' based on the distribution and chronological positioning of the finds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7737/is_200907/ai_n39230890/|title= CORRECTED PROVENANCE FOR THE LONG-NOSED GOD MASK FROM "A CAVE NEAR ROGANA, TENNESSEE"|accessdate=2010-07-30 | work=Southeastern Archaeology | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Jon Muller of [[Southern Illinois University]] proposed reorganizing the classification of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Theories and names|Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] into five [[Archaeological horizon|horizons]], with each as a discrete tradition defined by the origin of specific motifs and ritual objects. The first horizon he defines for his [[Mississippian Ideological Interaction Sphere]] is the ''Developmental Cult Period'' which went from 900 to 1150 CE and is marked by the appearance of the Long nosed god maskettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Galloway, Patricia|author =Muller, Jon|  title=The Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, Artifacts and Analysis:The Cottonlandia Conference| article = The Southern Cult | publisher = University of Nebraska Press| year = 1989 | pages = 11–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories about uses==
[[File:Spiro Big Boy effigy pipe HRoe 02.jpg|thumb|upright|"Resting Warrior" from Spiro with short nosed god maskette earring]]
{{cquote|''The long-nosed god maskettes may have functioned in the Early Mississippian Period of the eastern United States within an adoption ritual much like that of the Calumet ceremony of the historic period.----to create fictions of kinship between the powerful leader of a large polity and his political clients in outlying areas.

Some archaeologists, including [[James Bennett Griffin|James B. Griffin]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], at first believed that the Long-nosed god masks were evidence of contact with [[Mesoamerica]]. They identified the masks as possible representations of the [[Aztec]] deity [[Yacatecuhtli]],&lt;ref name=FULLER2008&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://users.stlcc.edu/mfuller/indianhill.html | title=Indian Hill Mound in St. Louis County, Missouri| accessdate=2010-08-01|year=2008|author=Fuller, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; an aspect of [[Quetzalcoatl]] whose name means “The Lord Who Guides”. Yacatecuhtli was worshipped by the [[pochteca]], a class of professional long-distance traveling merchants. In the 1990s anthropologist [[Robert L. Hall]] proposed that the maskettes were used by Mississippian peoples as part of ritual [[adoption]]s in which important leaders extended [[fictive kinship]] to visiting leaders in order to cement political alliances and trade relationships.&lt;ref name=TEJAS&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/fundamentals/images/prec41.html|title=Tejas| accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall, an expert on Native American belief systems, theorised that the maskettes were used to identify individuals involved in the adoption rituals with the figures of [[Red Horn (Siouan deity)|Red Horn]] (who was also known as "He-Who-Wears-Human-Heads-As-Earrings") and his sons.&lt;ref name=AZTALAN&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mpm.edu/collections/artifacts/anthropology/aztalan/outpost/|title=Aztalan – Wisconsin's Middle Mississippian Outpost|publisher=Milwaukee Public Museum|accessdate=2010-07-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527175058/http://www.mpm.edu/collections/artifacts/anthropology/aztalan/outpost/|archivedate=2010-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HALL1997&gt;{{cite book|

In his guise as "He who Gets Hit with Deer Lungs", Red Horn is also associated with the ''[[Calumet (pipe)|Calumet ceremony]]'', which is another fictive kinship/adoption ritual.&lt;ref name=DIETERLE&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| title = Redhorn (Wears Faces on His Ears)|first=Richard L.|last= Dieterle| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Hočąk (Winnebago) Mythology| accessdate = 2010-08-19|url=http://www.hotcakencyclopedia.com/ho.Redhorn.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The differing shapes of the noses found on earpieces, including long, bent and short varieties, are explained by the myths as differing stages of the ritualized adoption process. In one [[Caddo]]an myth, the "[[Feral child|wild brother]]" of the Hero Twins possesses a long nose which is magically shortened by a medicine man. This has led some researchers to think the masks start as the long nosed variety, denoting the first stage in the initiation process. As the individual progresses through the rituals, the nose is symbolically bent and eventually trimmed in the final phase, denoting full acceptance into the kinship system.&lt;ref name=DUNCAN2000/&gt;

'''Maurits Frederik Hendrik de Haas''' (December 12, 1832{{snd}}November 23, 1895) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-[[Americans|American]] [[marine painter]]. His name has been written as ''Mauritz Frederik de Haas'', ''Maurice F. H. de Haas'', ''Maurice Frederic Henri de Haas'', ''Mauritz Frederick Hendrick De Haas'', "Maurice Frederick Hendrick de Haas", as well as various other variations.&lt;ref name="famsf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.famsf.org:8080/view.shtml?record=4317&amp;=list&amp;=1&amp;=&amp;=And|title=Maurice Frederic Henri de Haas: ''Fishing Boats at Anchor''|accessdate=2007-04-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102742/http://search.famsf.org:8080/view.shtml?record=4317&amp;=list&amp;=1&amp;=&amp;=And|archivedate=2007-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Haas was born in [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. He studied art at the Rotterdam Academy and at [[The Hague]], under [[Johannes Bosboom]] and [[Louis Meyer]], and in 1851-1852 in [[London]], following the English watercolourists of the day. In 1857 he received an artist's commission in the [[Dutch Navy]], but in 1859, under the patronage of [[August Belmont]], who had recently been minister of the United States at The Hague, he resigned and moved to [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=De Haas, Mauritz Frederick Hendrick |volume=7 |page=932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became an associate of the [[National Academy]] in 1863 and an academician in 1867, and exhibited annually in the academy, and in 1866 he was one of the founders of the American Society of Painters in Water Colors.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He died in New York City.

His ''Farragut Passing the Forts at the Battle of New Orleans'' and ''The Rapids above Niagara'', which were exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Exposition of 1878]], were his best known but not his most typical works, for his favorite subjects were storm and wreck, wind and heavy surf, and less often moonlight on the coasts of Holland, of Jersey, of New England, [[Long Island]], the [[English Channel]]&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; and of [[Grand Manan]] island in the [[Bay of Fundy]].

His brother [[Willem Frederik de Haas]] (1830–1880) was also a marine painter.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The '''Ministry of Culture''' ({{lang-th|กระทรวงวัฒนธรรม}}; {{RTGS|''krasuang watthanatham''}} ) (MOC), is a [[Thailand|Thai]] government body responsible for the oversight of [[Culture in Thailand|culture]], [[Religion  in Thailand |religion]], and [[Art in Thailand |art]] in Thailand. Its [[Fiscal year|FY2019]] budget is 8,209.4 million [[Thai baht|baht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thailand's Budget in Brief Fiscal Year 2019 |url=http://www.bb.go.th/en/topic-detail.php?id=8322 |website=Bureau of the Budget |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|89}}

==History==
The Division of Culture was established in 1938 under the Department of Fine Arts. In 1952 it became the Ministry of Culture with the Department of Fine Arts as a subordinate agency. In 1958 it was renamed the Division of Culture and placed under the aegis of the [[Ministry of Education (Thailand)|Ministry of Education]] (MOE). In 2002, it was re-established as the Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.m-culture.go.th/en/article_view.php?nid=101 |website=Ministry of Culture (Thailand) (MOC) |accessdate=14 August 2018 |date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''History of the Thai Nation''==
Thailand's military junta was criticized for a history textbook it ordered written by the Fine Arts Department of the ministry. The book, ''History of the Thai Nation'',  claims that the military has established "true democracy" in Thailand and has eliminated corruption.&lt;ref name="AC-20180420"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai junta history book claims it established 'true democracy'|url=https://asiancorrespondent.com/2018/04/thai-history-book-lampooned-for-saying-military-junta-established-true-democracy/|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=Asian Correspondent|date=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015 the ministry's Fine Arts Department published ''History of the Thai Nation'' ({{lang-th|ประวัติศาสตร์ชาติไทย}}; {{rtgs|''prawat sat chat thai''}}) at the order of the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (NCPO).&lt;ref name=PTE-20180418&gt;{{cite news|title=New history textbook claims NCPO established true Thai democracy| url=https://prachatai.com/english/node/7716|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=Pratchatai English|date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCPO wanted a new history book covering the past 400 years to foster "national reconciliation". The book was written in two months.&lt;ref name="Nation-20180429"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phataranawik|first1=Phatarawadee|title=Writing and Rewriting History|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/big_read/30344212|accessdate=1 May 2018|work=The Nation|date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On page 195, the text reads, "Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha as Prime Minister has carried out a policy of reforming the country, reforming politics to be truly a democracy, eliminating corruption and using moral principles to lead the country to be truly a democracy."&lt;ref name=PTE-20180418/&gt; On page 197 it goes on to say, "After the coup d'etat, Gen Prayut became prime minister. He has tried to develop the country and reform Thai politics into a real democracy. Gen Prayut has used moral principles and stamped out corruption to return democracy to the country."&lt;ref name="BP-20180419"/&gt; The book maintains that the NCPO was forced to stage the 2014 coup to end the political chaos caused by the civilian government of the time. Ten thousand copies of the book were published at a cost of one million [[Thai baht|baht]]. Twenty copies autographed by Prayut were sold at the launch.&lt;ref name="Nation-20180429" /&gt; In November 2017, the prime minister ordered the Fine Arts Department to send 100 copies of the book to each of Thailand's provinces.&lt;ref name="BP-20180419"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kongrut|first1=Anchalee|title=Activist: 'Prayut as democracy hero' book a lie| url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1448146/activist-prayut-as-democracy-hero-book-a-lie|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leading critic of the junta charged that, "The content of the book is misleading and it will lead to the distortion of the country's history [if not corrected]."&lt;ref name="BP-20180419"/&gt; The culture ministry plans to translate the book to English for distribution to Thai embassies worldwide.&lt;ref name="Nation-20180429" /&gt;

'''Molecular symmetry''' in [[chemistry]] describes the [[symmetry]] present in [[molecule]]s and the classification of molecules according to their symmetry.  Molecular symmetry is a fundamental concept in chemistry, as it can be used to predict or explain many of a molecule's [[chemical property|chemical properties]], such as its [[molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]] and its allowed [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic transitions]]. Many university level textbooks on [[physical chemistry]], [[quantum chemistry]], and [[inorganic chemistry]] devote a chapter to symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Chemistry'', Third Edition John P. Lowe, Kirk Peterson {{ISBN|0-12-457551-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach'' by Donald A. McQuarrie, John D.

The predominant framework for the study of molecular symmetry is [[group theory]]. Symmetry is useful in the study of [[molecular orbital]]s, with applications such as the [[Hückel method]], [[ligand field theory]], and the [[Woodward-Hoffmann rule]]s. Another framework on a larger scale is the use of [[crystal system]]s to describe [[crystallography|crystallographic]] symmetry in bulk materials.  
 
Many techniques for the practical assessment of molecular symmetry exist, including [[X-ray crystallography]] and various forms of [[spectroscopy]]. [[Spectroscopic notation]] is based on symmetry considerations.

==Symmetry concepts==
The study of symmetry in molecules makes use of [[group theory]].

=== Elements ===
The point group symmetry of a molecule can be described by 5 types of [[symmetry element]]. 
{{anchor|axis}}
* '''Symmetry axis''': an axis around which a [[rotation]] by &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{360^\circ} {n} &lt;/math&gt; results in a molecule indistinguishable from the original.  This is also called an ''n''-fold '''rotational axis''' and abbreviated C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  Examples are the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axis in [[water]] and the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axis in [[ammonia]]. A molecule can have more than one symmetry axis; the one with the highest ''n'' is called the '''principal axis''', and by convention is aligned with the z-axis in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].
* '''Plane of symmetry''': a plane of reflection through which an identical copy of the original molecule is generated.  This is also called a [[mirror plane]] and abbreviated [[Sigma|σ]] (sigma = Greek "s", from the German 'Spiegel' meaning mirror).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newton.ex.ac.uk/research/qsystems/people/goss/symmetry/CharacterTables.html |title=Symmetry Operations and Character Tables  |last= |first= |date=2001 |website=University of Exeter |access-date=29 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Water has two of them: one in the plane of the molecule itself and one [[perpendicular]] to it. A symmetry plane [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] with the principal axis is dubbed ''vertical'' (σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) and one perpendicular to it ''horizontal'' (σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;). A third type of symmetry plane exists: If a vertical symmetry plane additionally bisects the angle between two 2-fold rotation axes perpendicular to the principal axis, the plane is dubbed [[Dihedral angle|dihedral]] (σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;). A symmetry plane can also be identified by its Cartesian orientation, e.g., (xz) or (yz).
* '''Center of symmetry''' or '''inversion center''', abbreviated ''i''.  A molecule has a center of symmetry when, for any atom in the molecule, an identical atom exists diametrically opposite this center an equal distance from it. In other words, a molecule has a center of symmetry when the points (x,y,z) and (-x,-y,-z) correspond to identical objects. For example, if there is an oxygen atom in some point (x,y,z), then there is an oxygen atom in the point (-x,-y,-z).  There may or may not be an atom at the inversion center itself.  Examples are [[xenon tetrafluoride]]  where the inversion center is at the Xe atom, and [[benzene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) where the inversion center is at the center of the ring.
* '''Rotation-reflection axis''': an axis around which a  rotation by &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{360^\circ} {n} &lt;/math&gt;, followed by a reflection in a plane perpendicular to it, leaves the molecule unchanged.  Also called  an ''n''-fold '''improper rotation axis''', it is abbreviated S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  Examples are present in tetrahedral [[silicon tetrafluoride]], with three S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axes, and the [[staggered conformation]] of [[ethane]] with one S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; axis.
* '''Identity''', abbreviated to E, from the German 'Einheit' meaning unity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;lang=de&amp;searchLoc=0&amp;cmpType=relaxed&amp;sectHdr=on&amp;spellToler=on&amp;search=einheit&amp;relink=on LEO Ergebnisse für "einheit"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This symmetry element simply consists of no change: every molecule has this element. While this element seems physically trivial, it must be included in the list of symmetry elements so that they form a mathematical [[group (mathematics)|group]], whose definition requires inclusion of the identity element. It is so called because it is analogous to multiplying by one (unity). In other words, E is a property that any object needs to have regardless of its symmetry properties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Inorganic Chemistry|last=Pfenning|first=Brian|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=9781118859025|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operations ===
[[Image:Xenon-tetrafluoride-3D-vdW.png|thumb|upright=0.8|[[xenon tetrafluoride|XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], with square planar geometry, has 1 C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axis and 4 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axes orthogonal to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. These five axes plus the mirror plane perpendicular to the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axis define the D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry group of the molecule.]]  
The five symmetry elements have associated with them five types of '''[[symmetry operation]]''', which leave the molecule in a state indistinguishable from the starting state. They are sometimes distinguished from symmetry elements by a [[caret]] or [[circumflex]]. Thus, Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the rotation of a molecule around an axis and Ê is the identity operation. A symmetry element can have more than one symmetry operation associated with it. For example, the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axis of the [[square planar molecular geometry|square]] [[xenon tetrafluoride]] (XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) molecule is associated with two Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rotations (90°) in opposite directions and a Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotation (180°). Since Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to Ê, Ŝ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to σ and Ŝ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ''î'',  all symmetry operations can be classified as either proper or improper rotations.

== Symmetry groups ==

===Groups===
The symmetry operations of a molecule (or other object) form a ''[[group (mathematics)|group]]'', which is a mathematical structure usually denoted in the form (''G'',*) consisting of a set  ''G''  and a binary combination operation say '*' satisfying certain properties listed below.

In a '''symmetry group''', the group elements are the symmetry operations (''not'' the symmetry elements), and the binary combination consists of applying first one symmetry operation and then the other. An example is the sequence of a C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rotation about the z-axis and a reflection in the xy-plane, denoted σ(xy)C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. By convention the order of operations is from right to left.

A symmetry group obeys the defining properties of any group.

(1) ''closure'' property: &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
For every pair of elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''G'', the ''product'' ''x''*''y'' is also in ''G''. &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  ( in symbols, for every two elements ''x'', ''y''∈''G'', ''x''*''y'' is also in ''G'' ). &lt;br&gt;This means that the group is ''closed'' so that combining two elements produces no new elements. Symmetry operations have this property because a sequence of two operations will produce a third state indistinguishable from the second and therefore from the first, so that the net effect on the molecule is still a symmetry operation.&lt;br&gt;
(2) ''associative'' property: &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
For every ''x'' and ''y'' and ''z'' in ''G'', both (''x''*''y'')*''z'' and ''x''*(''y''*''z'')  result with the same element in ''G''.  &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
( in symbols, (''x''*''y'')*''z'' = ''x''*(''y''*''z'' ) for every ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' ∈ ''G'')&lt;br&gt;
(3) ''existence of identity'' property: &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
There must be an element ( say ''e'' ) in  ''G'' such that product any element of ''G'' with ''e'' make no change to the element.  &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
( in symbols, ''x''*''e''=''e''*''x''= ''x'' for every ''x''∈ ''G'' )&lt;br&gt;
(4) ''existence of inverse'' property: &lt;br&gt;   &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
For each element ( ''x'' ) in  ''G'', there must be an element ''y'' in  ''G'' such that product  of  ''x'' and ''y'' is the identity element ''e''. &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
( in symbols, for each  ''x''∈''G''  there is a ''y'' ∈ ''G'' such that ''x''*''y''=''y''*''x''= ''e'' for every ''x''∈''G'' )

The ''order'' of a group is the number of elements in the group. For groups of small orders, the group properties can be easily verified by considering its composition table, a table whose rows and columns correspond to elements of the group and whose entries correspond to their products.

===Point groups and permutation-inversion groups===
[[File:Pt Group chart 2.png|thumb|800px|Chart for determining Point Group]]
The successive application (or ''composition'') of one or more symmetry operations of a molecule has an effect equivalent to that of some single symmetry operation of the molecule. For example, a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotation followed by a σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; reflection is seen to be a σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;' symmetry operation: σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;*C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'. (Note that "Operation A followed by B to form C" is written BA = C).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, the set of all symmetry operations (including this composition operation) obeys all the properties of a group, given above. So (''S'',''*'') is a group, where ''S'' is the set of all symmetry operations of some molecule, and * denotes the composition (repeated application) of symmetry operations.

This group is called the [[point group]] of that molecule, because the set of symmetry operations leave at least one point fixed (though for some symmetries an entire axis or an entire plane remains fixed). In other words, a point group is a group that summarizes all symmetry operations that all molecules in that category have.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The symmetry of a crystal, by contrast, is described by a [[space group]] of symmetry operations, which includes [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] in space.

One can determine the symmetry operations of the point group for a particular molecule by considering the geometrical symmetry of its molecular model. However, when one USES a point group, the operations in it are not to be interpreted in the same way. Instead the operations are interpreted as rotating and/or reflecting the vibronic (vibration-electronic) coordinates and these operations commute with the vibronic Hamiltonian. They are "symmetry operations" for that vibronic Hamiltonian. The point group is used to classify by symmetry the vibronic eigenstates. The symmetry classification of the rotational levels, the eigenstates of the full (rovibronic nuclear spin) Hamiltonian, requires the use of the appropriate permutation-inversion group as introduced by [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]]&lt;ref name=Longuet-Higgins1963&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Longuet-Higgins | first1 = H.C. | year = 1963 | title = The symmetry groups of non-rigid molecules | url = | journal = Molecular Physics | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 445–460 | doi = 10.1080/00268976300100501 | bibcode = 1963MolPh...6..445L }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The relation between point groups and permutation-inversion groups is explained in this pdf file [https://chemphys.ca/pbunker/PointGroupspdffile.html Link] .

===Examples of point groups===
Assigning each molecule a point group classifies molecules into categories with similar symmetry properties. For example, PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, POF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; all share identical symmetry operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfennig|first1=Brian|title=Principles of Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-85910-0|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; They all can undergo the identity operation E, two different C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; rotation operations, and three different σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; plane reflections without altering their identities, so they are placed in one point group, C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;, with order 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=pfennig|first1=Brian|title=Principles of Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-85910-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) also share identical symmetry operations. They both undergo the identity operation E, one C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotation, and two σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; reflections without altering their identities, so they are both placed in one point group, C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;, with order 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miessler|first1=Gary|title=Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9780321811059}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classification system helps scientists to study molecules more efficiently, since chemically related molecules in the same point group tend to exhibit similar bonding schemes, molecular bonding diagrams, and spectroscopic properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Common point groups===
The following table contains a list of point groups labelled using the [[Schoenflies notation]], which is common in chemistry and molecular spectroscopy. The description of structure includes common shapes of molecules, which can be explained by the [[VSEPR theory|VSEPR model]].

=== Representations ===

The symmetry operations can be [[group representation|represented in many ways]]. A convenient representation is by [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. For any vector representing a point in Cartesian coordinates, left-multiplying it gives the new location of the point transformed by the symmetry operation. Composition of operations corresponds to matrix multiplication. Within a point group, a multiplication of the matrices of two symmetry operations leads to a matrix of another symmetry operation in the same point group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, in the C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; example this is:
:&lt;math&gt;
 \underbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
     -1 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp;  0 &amp; 1 \\
      \end{bmatrix}
   }_{C_{2}} \times
 \underbrace{
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp;  0 &amp; 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
 }_{\sigma_{v}} = 
 \underbrace{
  \begin{bmatrix}
   -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
 }_{\sigma'_{v}}
&lt;/math&gt;
 
Although an infinite number of such representations exist, the [[irreducible representation]]s (or "irreps") of the group are commonly used, as all other representations of the group can be described as a linear combination of the irreducible representations.

== Character tables ==

{{Main|List of character tables for chemically important 3D point groups}}

For each point group, a '''character table''' summarizes information on its symmetry operations and on its irreducible representations. As there are always equal numbers of irreducible representations and classes of symmetry operations, the tables are square.

The table itself consists of '''characters''' that represent how a particular irreducible representation transforms when a particular symmetry operation is applied.  Any symmetry operation in a molecule's point group acting on the molecule itself will leave it unchanged.  But, for acting on a general entity, such as a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] or an [[Atomic orbital|orbital]], this need not be the case.  The vector could change sign or direction, and the orbital could change type.  For simple point groups, the values are either 1 or &amp;minus;1: 1 means that the sign or phase (of the vector or orbital) is unchanged by the symmetry operation (''symmetric'') and &amp;minus;1 denotes a sign change (''asymmetric'').

The representations are labeled according to a set of conventions:

* A, when rotation around the principal axis is symmetrical
* B, when rotation around the principal axis is asymmetrical
* E and T are doubly and triply degenerate representations, respectively
* when the point group has an inversion center, the subscript g ({{lang-de|gerade}} or even) signals no change in sign, and the subscript u (''ungerade'' or uneven) a change in sign, with respect to inversion.
* with point groups C&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;∞h&lt;/sub&gt; the symbols are borrowed from [[angular momentum]] description: [[sigma|Σ]], [[Pi (letter)|Π]], [[Delta (letter)|Δ]].

The tables also capture information about how the Cartesian basis vectors, rotations about them, and quadratic functions of them transform by the symmetry operations of the group, by noting which irreducible representation transforms in the same way.  These indications are conventionally on the righthand side of the tables.  This information is useful because chemically important orbitals (in particular ''p'' and ''d'' orbitals) have the same symmetries as these entities.

The character table for the C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry point group is given below:

{| class="wikitable" 
 ! C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; || E || C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;(xz) || σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'(yz) || || 
 |-
 | A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || ''z'' 
 | ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
 |-
 | A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || &amp;minus;1 || R&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; || ''xy''
 |-
 | B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || ''x'', R&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; || ''xz''
 |-
 | B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || &amp;minus;1 || 1 || ''y'', R&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; || ''yz''
|}
 
Consider the example of water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), which has the C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry described above.  The 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; [[atomic orbital|orbital]] of oxygen has B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry as in the fourth row of the character table above, with x in the sixth column). It is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and switches sign with a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'(yz) operation, but remains unchanged with the other two operations (obviously, the character for the identity operation is always +1). This orbital's character set is thus {1, &amp;minus;1, 1, &amp;minus;1}, corresponding to the B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; irreducible representation. Likewise, the 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital is seen to have the symmetry of the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; irreducible representation (''i.e''.: none of the symmetry operations change it), 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the  3''d''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; orbital A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  These assignments and others are noted in the rightmost two columns of the table.

== Historical background ==

[[Hans Bethe]] used characters of point group operations in his study of [[ligand field theory]] in 1929, and [[Eugene Wigner]] used group theory to explain the selection rules of [[atomic spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Group Theory and its application to the quantum mechanics of atomic spectra'', E. P. Wigner, Academic Press Inc. (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; The first character tables were compiled by [[László Tisza]] (1933), in connection to vibrational spectra. [[Robert Mulliken]] was the first to publish character tables in English (1933), and [[E. Bright Wilson]] used them in 1934 to predict the symmetry of vibrational [[normal mode]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Correcting Two Long-Standing Errors in Point Group Symmetry Character Tables'' Randall B. Shirts [[J. Chem. Educ.]] 2007, 84, 1882. [http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/Journal/Issues/2007/Nov/abs1882.html Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; The complete set of 32 crystallographic point groups was published in 1936 by Rosenthal and Murphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenthal | first1 = Jenny E. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = G. M. | year = 1936 | title = Group Theory and the Vibrations of Polyatomic Molecules | url = | journal = Rev. Mod. Phys. | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 317–346 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.8.317 | bibcode=1936RvMP....8..317R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular nonrigidity==
{{See also|Fluxional molecule}}
Point groups are useful for describing ''rigid'' molecules which undergo only small oscillations about a single equilibrium geometry, and for which the distorting effects of molecular rotation can be ignored, so that the symmetry operations all correspond to simple geometrical operations. However [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]] has introduced a more general type of symmetry group suitable not only for rigid molecules but also for ''non-rigid'' molecules that tunnel between equivalent geometries (called ''versions'') and which can also allow for the distorting effects of molecular rotation.&lt;ref name=Longuet-Higgins1963/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Bunker and Per Jensen (2005), ''Fundamentals of Molecular Symmetry'' (Institute of Physics Publishing) {{ISBN|0-7503-0941-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups are known as ''permutation-inversion'' groups, because the symmetry operations in them are energetically feasible permutations of identical nuclei, or  inversion  with respect to the center of mass, or a combination of the two.

For example, [[ethane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) has three equivalent [[staggered conformation]]s. Tunneling between the conformations occurs at ordinary temperatures by ''internal rotation'' of one [[methyl group]] relative to the other. This is not a rotation of the entire molecule about the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axis. Although each conformation has D&lt;sub&gt;3d&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, as in the table above, description of the internal rotation and associated quantum states and energy levels requires the more complete permutation-inversion group G&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;.

Similarly, [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) has two equivalent pyramidal (C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;) conformations which are interconverted by the process known as [[nitrogen inversion]]. This is not an inversion in the sense used for point group symmetry operations of rigid molecules (i.e., the inversion of vibrational displacements and electronic coordinates in the center of mass) since NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has no inversion center. Rather it the inversion of all nuclei and electrons in the center of mass (close to the nitrogen atom), which happens to be energetically feasible for this molecule. The appropriate permutation-inversion group to be used in this situation is D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;(M) which is isomorphic with the point group D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;.

Additionally, as examples, the [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; molecules have highly symmetric equilibrium structures with T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt; point group symmetries respectively; they lack permanent electric dipole moments but they do have very weak pure rotation spectra because of rotational
centrifugal distortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = J.K.G | year = 1971 | title = Forbidden rotational spectra of polyatomic molecules | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 546-544 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2852(71)90255-4 | bibcode = 1971JMoSp..40..536W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Oldani | first = M.|display-authors=etal | year = 1985 | title =Pure rotational spectra of methane and methane-d4 in the vibrational ground state observed by microwave Fourier transform spectroscopy| url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy | volume = 110 | issue = 1| pages = 93-105 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2852(85)90215-2 | bibcode = 1985JMoSp.110...93O}}&lt;/ref&gt; The permutation-inversion groups required for the complete study of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;(M) and D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;(M), respectively.

A second and less general approach to the symmetry of nonrigid molecules is due to Altmann.&lt;ref&gt;Altmann S.L. (1977) ''Induced Representations in Crystals and Molecules'', Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flurry&gt;Flurry, R.L. (1980) ''Symmetry Groups'', Prentice-Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-880013-8}}, pp.115-127&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach the symmetry groups are known as ''Schrödinger supergroups'' and consist of two types of operations (and their combinations): (1) the geometric symmetry operations (rotations, reflections, inversions) of rigid molecules, and (2) ''isodynamic operations'', which take a nonrigid molecule into an energetically equivalent form by a physically  reasonable process such as rotation about a single bond (as in ethane) or a molecular inversion (as in ammonia).&lt;ref name=Flurry/&gt;

Many of the novels and short stories written or co-written by [[Stephen King]] take place in a [[multiverse]] created by the author.

== Fictional history, structure and worlds of Stephen King's multiverse ==
In the beginning, there was a magical presence known as the Prim—also referred as the "darkness behind everything"–from which [[List of The Dark Tower characters#Gan|Gan]] arose. When All-World was created, Gan appeared in metaphysical form as a giant edifice known as the Dark Tower, alongside six Beams, which are protected by twelve Guardians.

It is said that one of the Guardians, Maturin the Turtle, vomited out a universe as the result of a stomach ache. This universe includes the Keystone Earth, which is a reflection of the "real world" and also includes a fictional version of Stephen King himself. It is the universe of the Rose too.

Some people have the ability to travel between universes by "going Todash"; other ways are through rare artifacts like the Wizard's Rainbow, the Talisman, and the Lil Pink.

Gan uses Stephen King as a facilitator to tell the tale of the Gunslinger, so [[Roland Deschain]] could successfully go about his task of reaching the Tower. If the author died before completing his task, Roland would not have "known" how to further proceed on his quest to the Tower and, without any significant remaining opposition, the [[Crimson King]] would have finally toppled the Dark Tower and initiated "Discordia"—the event which all universes would have ceased to exist—and there would be no story created.

== ''Ka'' ==
''Ka'' is a plot element in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series. It is a word of the [[fictional language]] High Speech.

In the books, it is a mysterious force that leads all living (and unliving) creatures. It is the will of [[List of The Dark Tower characters#Gan|Gan]], the approximate equivalent of [[destiny]] or [[fate]], in King's fictional language of High Speech. ''Ka'' can be considered to be a guide, a destination, but is certainly not a plan—at least, not one that is known to mortals. Ka is not necessarily a force of [[good and evil|good or evil]]; it manipulates both sides, and seems to have no definite [[morality]] of its own. To this end, Ka resonates with the concept of [[karma]].

=== Concepts involving ''ka'' ===
Because of the importance of ''ka'' to the world of King's ''Dark Tower'', many phrases in the High Speech use the word ka, such as:

*ka-babbies: young ka-tet members.
*ka-tel: a class of apprentice gunslingers.
*ka-mai: ka's fool.
*ka-me: ka's wiseman; the opposite of ka-mai.
*kas-ka: a prophet
*ka-shume: a unique feeling that a ka-tet is destined to break soon.
*te-ka: ka's friend.
*Can'-Ka No Rey: the red fields of none, where the Dark Tower lies.
*tet-ka can Gan: the [[navel]] (specifically, the navel of [[Gan (Stephen King)|Gan]]).
*kas-ka Gan: singer of Gan's song/ prophet of Gan.
*ves-ka Gan: Song of the Turtle

==== ''Ka-tet'' ====
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted:[[Image:Book7-06-algul-siento-destroyed.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Roland's Ka-tet. Art by [[Michael Whelan]].]]--&gt; 
A ''ka-tet'' is a group of beings brought together by ''ka''. "We are ''ka-tet''. We are one from many," says [[Roland Deschain]] on the day before the Battle of Algul Siento.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower VII]]''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ka-tet'' is the belief that a group of people can be tied together by fate, or ''ka''. It is said that a group has shared "khef" or the water of life. Sometimes the symbol of water is used literally, as in a ritual Roland and his ''ka-tet'' performs the night before the battle of Algul Siento. In the seventh novel, Susannah Dean, who ends up understanding ka maybe more than Roland himself, comes to the understanding that in simple terms, "ka-tet" means family.

Roland's ''ka-tet'' includes himself, [[Eddie Dean (The Dark Tower)|Eddie Dean]], [[Susannah Dean]], [[Oy (Dark Tower)|Oy]], and [[Jake Chambers]]. Roland's previous ''ka-tet'' included himself, [[Cuthbert Allgood]], [[Jamie De Curry]], and [[Alain Johns]].

=== References in other works by King ===
{{wiktionary|ka}}
''Ka'' is mentioned in some of King's other books, including ''[[Hearts in Atlantis]]'', ''[[Desperation (novel)|Desperation]]'' and ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]''. The characters James Eric Gardener in ''[[The Tommyknockers]]'' and Rosie McClendon in ''[[Rose Madder (novel)|Rose Madder]]'' also ponder about ''ka''. It is mentioned in ''[[The Stand]]'' by Judge Farris when he observes a crow outside his window that he believes is [[Randall Flagg]] shortly before he is killed by Flagg's men. However, in this context it appears that "ka" refers to the [[Egypt]]ian word for life force.

The ''ka-tet'' concept has been frequently used by King, even in books that do not use the terms ''ka'' or ''ka-tet'', such as ''[[It (novel)|It]]'', ''[[The Stand]]'', ''[[Desperation (novel)|Desperation]]'', ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]'', ''[[Dreamcatcher (novel)|Dreamcatcher]]'', and ''[[Duma Key]]''. This may be compared to [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s "[[karass]]".

== The Random and the Purpose ==
{{quote|''The Random and the Purpose are like the red and the black squares on a checker board, defining each other by contrast.''|Lachesis}}

The Random and the Purpose are concepts elaborating the "grammar" of All-World introduced in ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]''. The Purpose and the Random are driving forces on the different levels (worlds or realities) the Dark Tower connects. There are even stronger forms like the Higher Purpose and the Higher Random. It is not totally clear whether these higher forms are multiple individual beings sharing a common aim, or if they are underlying forces not bound to personal forms. Both Purpose and Random have so-called agents, middlemen between ordinary human beings ("Short-Timers") and the god-like All-Timers. Clotho and Lachesis are agents of the Purpose, while Atropos is an agent of the Random. Central is the idea that Purpose and Random need to be in balance.

=== The Higher Random and the Higher Purpose ===
For each field exist higher beings which seem to be god-like. While arguably Gan or Maturin would belong to the Higher Purpose , the Crimson King or It are beings of the Higher Random .

{{quote|''[...] beyond the Short-Time levels of existence and the Long-Time levels on which Lachesis, Atropos and I exist, there are yet other levels. These are inhabited by creatures we could call All-Timers, beings which are either eternal or so close to it as to make no difference. Short-Timers and Long-Timers live in overlapping spheres of existence - on connected floors of the same building, if you like - ruled by the Random and the Purpose. Above these floors, inaccessible to us but very much a part of the same tower of existence, live other beings. Some of them are marvellous and wonderful; other are hideous beyond our ability to comprehend, let alone yours. These beings might be called the Higher Purpose and the Higher Random...or perhaps there is no Random beyond a certain level; we suspect that may be the case, but we have no real way of telling. We do know that it is something from one of these higher levels that has interested itself in Ed, and that something else from up there made a countermove. That countermove is you, Ralph and Louis.''|Clotho}}

'''Nicolas-Marie Ozanne''' (12 January 1728 – 5 January 1811) was a marine artist, author of a naval treatise and creator of a series of 60 views of the ports of France. His work witnesses to the French Navy of his time, particularly the [[Ponant fleet|Ponant (western) fleet]].

==Life==
Ozanne was born in [[Brest, France]]. His drawing skills were recognised at a very early age and aged only 10 he was given a place in the studio of Robelin, a drawing master in the [[gardes de la marine]], becoming his assistant in 1742. There he was talent-spotted by Bigot de la Mothe, who had him draw plans for coastal gun batteries.&lt;ref name=Dinechin&gt;Dinechin, ''Duhamel du Monceau''&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:74canons-ozanne.jpg|thumb|''[[Second-rate|Vaisseau de 74 canons]]'', by Nicolas Ozanne]]

He was only 16 when his father died. Nicolas-Marie then took on his brothers and sisters to his care&lt;ref group=N&gt;His sister, Jeanne-Françoise Ozanne, (10 October 1735,  Brest – 20 February 1795, Paris), was an engraver – her works include ''Vues de Dieppe, de Saint- Valéry, de Livourne, des colonies françaises''. His second sister, Marie-Jeanne Ozanne (12 February 1736, Brest – 16 February 1786, Paris), married the engraver [[Yves-Marie Le Gouaz|Le Gouaz]], whilst her own works include ''Vue de Livourne'' and ''Temps serein'', after [[Claude Joseph Vernet|Vernet]] ; the ''Ferme flamande'' and the ''Relais flamands'', after [[Philips Wouwerman|Wouwerman]]. His brother, [[Pierre Ozanne]] (3 December 1737, Brest – 10 February 1813, Brest) was an engraver and marine engineer.&lt;/ref&gt; as engravers to give them a livelihood; his sister [[Marie-Élisabeth Ozanne|Marie-Élisabeth]] also took up [[pastel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pastellists.com/Articles/OZANNE.pdf Profile of Marie-Élisabeth Ozanne] at the ''Dictionary of Pastellists Before 1800''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was then spotted by [[Duhamel du Monceau]], who recommended him to [[Antoine Louis Rouillé]] – Ozanne then illustrated several works by Duhamel, with whom he was friends.

In 1750, Nicolas Ozanne succeeded Robelin as professor of drawing. In 1751, Rouillé employed him to produce ship designs then engravings of  [[Louis XIV]]'s trip to [[Le Havre|Havre]] in 1749. He was admitted as an assistant-member of the [[Académie de Marine]] and in 1757 made a naval artist at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. In 1762 he was given a role in the military geographers' department and at this time was also put in charge of educating the Dauphin's children in naval matters, contributing to the future [[Louis XVI]]'s interest in the sea.&lt;ref name=Dinechin/&gt; Ozanne retired in 1791, living in poverty until his death in [[Paris]] aged 82.

Kirillov. Nikolai Nikolaevich Baskakov. Leningrad, Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1991. P.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lenin in Kremlin (painting).jpg|thumb|380px|left|''[[Lenin in Kremlin (painting)|Lenin in Kremlin]]'', 1960]]

In 1945 Nikolai Baskakov went to Leningrad and entered the Department of Painting of the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]], where he studied under Leonid Ovsannikov, [[Boris Fogel]], [[Genrikh Pavlovsky]], and [[Alexander Zaytsev (artist)|Alexander Zaytsev]].

In 1951 Nikolai Baskakov graduated from the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Ilya Repin Institute of Arts]] under the supervision of the [[Boris Ioganson]]'s workshop, together with [[Alexei Eriomin]], [[Mikhail Kaneev]], [[Maya Kopitseva]], [[Anatoli Levitin]], Avenir Parkhomenko, [[Arseny Semionov]], [[Mikhail Trufanov]], [[Boris Ugarov]], and other young artists of the time. His graduation work had been the historical painting ''Lenin and Stalin in Smolny''.&lt;ref&gt;''Anniversary Directory graduates of Saint Petersburg State Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture named after Ilya Repin, Russian Academy of Arts. 1915 - 2005''. - Saint Petersburg: Pervotsvet Publishing House, 2007. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1951, Baskakov had been a permanent exhibitor of the Leningrad Art exhibitions, where he presented his work among with others pieces of art by the leading painters of fine arts in Leningrad. He painted historical paintings and war-depicting works, genre scenes, portraits, landscapes and made sketches of every-day life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socrealizm.com.ua/gallery/artist/baskakov-nv-1928|title=Вологодский художник Баскаков Николай Владимирович|last=|first=|date=|website=Socialist Realism. Kiev club of collectors.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baskakov worked in the technique of oil painting. In the same year together with artists Grigory Chepets and [[Mikhail Trufanov]] he performed his first large order - the painting ''Presenting of the Order of Lenin to the Kirov factory'', for which he was admitted as a member of the [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists|Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of members of the Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation''.

For the art of Nikolai Baskakov typical appeal to the themes of large public sound and to the image of a contemporary, disclosed in a picture-portrait. He was most known for his impressive portraits of contemporaries painted in realistic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socrealizm.com.ua/gallery/artist/baskakov-nn-1928|title=Ленинградский художник Баскаков Николай Николаевич (artist Baskakov Nikolai Nikolaevich)|last=|first=|date=|website=Socialist Realism.

==History==
[[File:Prophets Of Rage @ Tinley Park, IL 9-3-2016 (29882366702).jpg|alt=The band onstage with a large banner reading "Make America Rage Again"|thumb|The band on tour, 2016]]
Morello declared to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'': "We're an elite task force of revolutionary musicians determined to confront this mountain of election year bullshit, and confront it head-on with [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall stack]]s blazing."&lt;ref name="rollingstone.com"/&gt;

The band's name derives from the title of the Public Enemy song "Prophets of Rage" from its 1988 album ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]''. To coincide with the band's protest performance at the Republican National Convention, it released its debut single, titled "Prophets of Rage". The band played its first live show on January 20, 2016.

From May 2016 through October 2016, the band embarked on a North American tour, dubbed the "Make America Rage Again Tour". The set list combined the catalogues of each of the band members' current and former groups, as well as new material written by the band. There is a "Make the World Rage Again" tour scheduled for 2017.

An EP ''The Party’s Over'' was released on August 19, 2016. Alongside the songs ''Prophets of Rage'' and ''The Party’s Over'', the EP contains live cover versions of the songs "[[Killing in the Name]]" (Rage Against the Machine), "Shut 'Em Down" (Public Enemy) and "No Sleep 'til Cleveland", a rework of "[[No Sleep 'til Brooklyn]]" by the [[Beastie Boys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/prophets-of-rage-to-release-the-partys-over-five-song-ep/ |title=PROPHETS OF RAGE To Release 'The Party's Over' Five-Song EP |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |language=englisch |accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EP was produced by [[Brendan O'Brien (record producer)|Brendan O'Brien]].

On June 1, 2017, the band released a single with accompanying music video for the track "Unfuck the World" from their album ''Prophets of Rage''. The band released the singles "Living on the 110" on July 11 and "Radical Eyes" on July 22.  The self-titled album, featuring all original material, was released on September 15 by [[Fantasy Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leight |first=Elias |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/prophets-of-rage-prep-debut-lp-release-michael-moore-video-w485195 |title=Prophets of Rage Prep Debut LP, Release Michael Moore Video |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2017-06-01 |accessdate=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/prophets-of-rage-prophets-of-rage/|title=Prophets of Rage: Prophets of Rage Album Review - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rabbula Gospels''', or '''Rabula Gospels''', (Florence, Biblioteca Mediceo Laurenziana, cod. Plut. I, 56) is a 6th-century [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Gospel Book]]. One of the finest Byzantine works produced in [[Asia]], and one of the earliest Christian manuscripts with large miniatures, it is distinguished by the miniaturist's predilection for bright colours, movement, drama, and [[expressionism]]. Coming from a period from which little art survives, and which saw great development in Christian [[iconography]], the manuscript has a significant place in art history, and is very often referred to.

Recent scholarship has suggested that the manuscript completed in 586 was later partly overpainted by restorers and bound together with miniatures from other sources in the 15th or 16th century.&lt;ref name="G.Peers"/&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Meister des Rabula-Evangeliums 002.jpg|thumb|left|The earliest crucifixion in an [[illuminated manuscript]], from the Rabbula Gospels.]]
The Gospel was completed in 586 at Monastery of St. John of Zagba (Syriac: {{lang|syr|ܒܝܬ ܙܓܒܐ}}, ''{{transl|syr|Bēṯ Zaḡbā}}''), which, although traditionally thought to have been in Northern Mesopotamia, is now thought to have been in the hinterland between [[Antioch]] and [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]] in modern [[Syria]]. It was signed by its scribe, Rabbula ({{lang|syr|ܪܒܘܠܐ}}, ''{{transl|syr|Rabbulā}}'') about whom nothing else is known. In their current condition the folios are 34&amp;nbsp;cm (13.4&amp;nbsp;in) by 27&amp;nbsp;cm (10.6&amp;nbsp;in). Their original size is unknown because they were trimmed during previous rebindings. The text is written in black or dark brown ink in two columns of a variable number of lines. There are footnotes written in red ink at the bottom of many of the columns. The text is the [[Peshitta]] version of the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translation of the Gospels.

The manuscript is illuminated, with the text framed in elaborate floral and architectural motifs. The Gospel canons are set in [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s ornamented with flowers and birds. The miniaturist obviously drew some of his inspiration from [[Hellenistic]] art (draped figures), but relied mainly on the ornamental traditions of [[Persia]]. The miniatures of the Rabbula Gospels, notably those representing the [[Crucifixion]], the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] and [[Pentecost]], are real pictures with a decorative frame formed of [[zigzag]]s, [[curve]]s, [[rainbow]]s and so forth. The scene of the Crucifixion is the earliest to survive in an illuminated manuscript, and shows the Eastern form of the image at the time.  There is a miniature of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]]s choosing a new twelfth member (after the loss of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]); this is not an event found in the [[Canonical Gospels]] (though it is mentioned in Chapter 1 of [[Acts]]) and is almost never seen in later art.  The artist was trained in the classical illusionist tradition, and is a competent and practiced hand rather than an outstanding talent; but surviving images from this period are so rare that his are extremely valuable for showing the style and [[iconography]] of his age.
[[File:RabulaGospelsFolio04vCanonTable.jpg|thumb|250px|Folio 4v of the Rabbula Gospels showing the [[canon tables]], harmonization of the four gospels, with marginal miniatures.]]

The French Orientalist Edgard Blochet (1870–1937) argued that some of the folios of the manuscript, including the pictorial series, were an interpolation no earlier than the 10th or 11th century. Since the original [[Photo caption|caption]] accompanying the miniatures is of the same paleographic character as the main text of the manuscript, this theory was rejected by Giuseppe Furlani and by Carlo Cecchelli in the commentary of the facsimile edition of the miniatures published in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sor.cua.edu/Bible/RabbulaMs.html Miniatures from the Rabbula Gospels ms.]&lt;/ref&gt;  But doubts as to the original unity of the contents continued.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David H. "The Date and Arrangement of the Illustrations in the Rabbula Gospels." Dumbarton Oaks Papers 27 (1973): 197-208. Web., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1291340 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, scholars have proposed that the text of 586 was only bound up together with the miniatures in the 15th century, and that the miniatures themselves were taken from at least one other original manuscript, and come from two different campaigns of work.&lt;ref name="G.Peers"&gt;Peers, Glenn, [https://www.academia.edu/285889/Review_of_Il_Tetravangelo_di_Rabbula._Firenze_Biblioteca_Medicea_Laurenziana_Plut._1.56._L_illustrazione_del_Nuovo_Testamento_nella_Siria_del_VI_secolo_ed._M._Bernab%C3%B2_Rome_2008 Review of Bernabò] (see Further reading)&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the manuscript after it was written is vague until the 11th century when it was at [[(Maifuc -Jbeil/Byblos Lebanon)]].  In the late 13th or early 14th century it came to [[Kadisha Valley#The Qannubin Monastery|Quannubin]].  In the late 15th or early 16th century, the manuscript was taken by the [[Maronite]] Patriarch to the [[Laurentian Library]] in [[Florence]], where it is today.

The Manuscript has served during Medieval Age as register of Maronites Patriarches (Elias Kattar) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holy Spirit University of Kaslik {{!}} لبنان الوسيط  عهد السلاطين المماليك|url=http://www.usek.edu.lb/en/publications/phoenix/loubnan-waseet|website=www.usek.edu.lb|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;,

==Background and history==
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}

==Judaism==
There is no consensus in the views of  Jewish religious leaders, scholars and commentators on whether Jews can eat GM food products or engage in research in the area of GM food technology.&lt;ref name=BMC&gt;Omobowale EB, Singer PA, Daar AS. (2009) [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/9/18 The three main monotheistic religions and gm food technology: an overview of perspectives.] BMC Int Health Hum Rights. 2009 Aug 22;9:18.&lt;/ref&gt;

One perspective emphasizes that humanity was created in God's image and this means that humanity can "partner with God in the perfection of everything in the world," and therefore Jewish law accepts genetic engineering to save and prolong human life as well as increase the quality or quantity of the world's food supply.&lt;ref name=BMC /&gt;

Other perspectives hold that GM food technology is a violation of [[Kil'ayim (prohibition)|Kil'ayim]], the mixed breeding of crops or livestock, and that because God made "distinctions in the natural world", Jews must honor them.&lt;ref name=BMC /&gt;

From the perspective of kosher laws, food made with genes from pigs or other non-kosher animals would likely be nonkosher.&lt;ref&gt;Steven M. Druker, Executive Director, Alliance for Bio-Integrity (1997) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130514014950/http://www.biointegrity.org/Halakha.html Are Genetically Engineered Foods in Accord with Jewish Law?] Published on Ag Biotech InfoNet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
Islam too forbids eating of pork, and Islamic scholars have also raised concern about the theoretical production of foods with genes from pigs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yahyayunus.net/2.html Islam and GMOs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430161013/http://www.yahyayunus.net/2.html |date=2009-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

And there are varying perspectives.   A seminar of Islamic scholars in Kuwait on genetics and genetic engineering in October 1998 concluded that although there are fears about the possibility of the harmful effects of GM food technology and GM food products on human beings and the environment, there are no laws within Islam which stop the genetic modification of food crops and animals.&lt;ref name=BMC /&gt;   And in 2003, the Indonesian Ulemas Council (MUI) approved the importation and consumption of genetically modified food products by Indonesian Muslims.&lt;ref name=BMC /&gt;  Others have written that while there are Quranic verses forbidding humanity from defacing God's creation, these "cannot be invoked as a total and radical ban on genetic engineering ... If carried too far, it would conflict with many forms of curative surgery that also entail some change in God's creation".&lt;ref name=BMC /&gt;

Voices in opposition to GMOs argue, based on the Quran,   that there is no need for genetic modification of food crops because God created everything perfectly and man does not have any right to manipulate anything that God has created nor to tamper with it.&lt;ref name=BMC /&gt;

==Christianity==

===Roman Catholic Church===

Views of Rome on genetic engineering
In 1999, after two years of discussions,  the Vatican's [[Pontifical Academy for Life]] stated that modifying the genes of plants and animals is theologically acceptable.  The Guardian reported that "Bishop Elio Sgreccia, vice- president of the pontifical academy, said: 'We are increasingly encouraged that the advantages of genetic engineering of plants and animals are greater than the risks. The risks should be carefully followed through openness, analysis and controls, but without a sense of alarm.'   Referring to genetically modified products such as corn and soya, Sgreccia added: 'We give it a prudent 'yes' We cannot agree with the position of some groups that say it is against the will of God to meddle with the genetic make-up of plants and animals.'"&lt;ref&gt;Antony Barnett for the Guardian. November 27, 1999 [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/1999/nov/28/food.gm GM food: special report.  Vatican theologians say 'prudent yes' to GM foods]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Prakash for AgBioWorld. June 15, 2001. [http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/religion/catholic.html The Catholic Church is Not against the Use of Biotechnology in Agriculture But Simply Advocates Prudence and Regulation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 as part of the [[Great Jubilee]] Pope [[John Paul II]] gave an address concerning agriculture, at which he said: The "famous words of Genesis entrust the earth to man's use, not abuse. They do not make man the absolute arbiter of the earth's governance, but the Creator's "co-worker":  a stupendous mission, but one which is also marked by precise boundaries that can never be transgressed with impunity. This is a principle to be remembered in agricultural production itself, whenever there is a question of its advance through the application of biotechnologies, which cannot be evaluated solely on the basis of immediate economic interests. They must be submitted beforehand to rigorous scientific and ethical examination, to prevent them from becoming disastrous for human health and the future of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;John Pail II. 11 November 2000  [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20001111_jubilagric_en.html Address to the Jubilee of the Agricultural World.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Lyman (2000) [http://online.sfsu.edu/rone/GEessays/PopeGMO.htm Pope Expresses Opposition to GMOs, Cites Need for 'the Respect of Nature']  Daily Report for Executives 221:A-6. Bureau of National Affairs, Inc., ISSN 1523-567X&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other studies and statements====
A 2002 meeting between bishops and scientists in the Philippines concluded that biotechnology could be an important stepping stone in the struggle against hunger and environmental pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/religion/zenit.html Biotechnology seen as a key help for developing countries]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 symposium gathered by Cardinal [[Renato T. Martino]] has examined the use of GMOs in modern agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-8652?l=english Symposium Looking at Genetically Modified Organisms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627041843/http://www.zenit.org/article-8652?l=english |date=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symposium's study  argued that the future of humanity is at stake and that there is no room for the ideological arguments advanced by environmentalists.&lt;ref name="Vatican says GM food is a Blessing"&gt;[http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/religion/blessing.html Vatican says GM food is a Blessing]&lt;/ref&gt;
Velasio De Paolis, a professor of canon law at the Pontifical Urban University, has said that it was "easy to say no to GM food if your stomach is full".&lt;ref name="Vatican says GM food is a Blessing"/&gt;

In 2008, Fr. Sean McDonagh, an Irish Columban priest and "well-known commentator on environmental issues", questioned whether  hosts from [[transgenic wheat]] could ever be approved by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] because of the Church's strict rules regarding [[sacramental bread]]. He specifically cited canon 924, which stipulates the bread must be wheaten only, and recently made, so that there is no danger of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Reilly for Independent.ie August 24, 2008 [http://www.independent.ie/national-news/eucharist-from-gm-wheat-contravenes-canon-law-1462177.html Eucharist from GM wheat 'contravenes canon law']&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study on genetically modified organisms sponsored by the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] came to a favorable conclusion on GMOs, viewing them as praiseworthy for improving the lives of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncronline.org/news/ecology/vatican-study-endorses-gmos-food-security Vatican study endorses GMOs for food security]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====

The Philippines is a predominantly Catholic country, and official pronouncements of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) exert a strong influence in policy making and the CBCP has not supported biotechnology, and probably will not until there is an official endorsement from the Pope.&lt;ref name=Cabanilla&gt;Liborio S. Cabanilla, University of the Philippines at Los Banos.  (2007)[http://www.agbioforum.org/v10n3/v10n3a07-cabanilla.htm Socio-Economic and Political Concerns for GM Foods and Biotechnology Adoption in the Philippines]. AgBioForum, 10(3), 178-183.&lt;/ref&gt; President Arroyo’s visit to Rome on September 27, 2003, she apparently consulted Pope John Paul II about the Church position on biotechnology. On the basis of that meeting, she issued a statement indicating that she felt it was important that opponents of GMOs knew that according to the Vatican, GMOs are not immoral.&lt;ref name=Cabanilla /&gt;  The CBCP issued a statement in response stating that the Pope had not endorsed GMOs.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.  Asia Africa Intelligence Wire.  October 03, 2003 [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-24569847_ITM CBCP refutes GMA on GMOs]  Originally published in Philippine Daily Inquirer&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2009 Bishop Vicente Navarra of the Diocese of Bacolod in the Philippines issued a pastoral letter calling on the Negros Occidental and Bacolod City governments to continue banning the entry of GMO products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewstoday.info/2009/06/02/bishop.issues.pastoral.letter.backing.anti.gmo.stance.html Bishop issues pastoral letter backing anti-GMO stance]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglican communion===
In 2004, the Church Environmental Network, representing members of the Anglican church of South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neccsa.org.za/Documents-CPSA-CEN.htm "Celebrating God's Creation: Ukuvuyisana Ngendalo kaThixo"  ENVIRONMENT NETWORK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121055155/http://www.neccsa.org.za/Documents-CPSA-CEN.htm |date=2008-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; spoke out against the South African government's backing of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Writer for Independent Online News.  December 6, 2004 [http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/anglican-group-hits-at-state-s-stand-on-gmos-1.228729#.UI38kGl26gk Anglican church group hits at government stand on GMOs]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Aid]], a British ecumenical group, released a paper in 2000 that expressed sharp concerns about the agricultural biotechnology industry, particularly with regard to its potential effects on impoverished people and economic development in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Aid International Policy Briefing Jan 2000 [http://hdrnet.org/331/1/Biotechnology.pdf Biotechnology and genetically modified organisms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327105835/http://hdrnet.org/331/1/Biotechnology.pdf |date=2014-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amish farmers===
About 550 [[Amish]] farmers in Pennsylvania have adopted nicotine-free tobacco since 2001, because it pays "about $1.50 per pound for the nicotine-free tobacco, nearly double the 80-cent-per-pound rate for traditional tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Joshua, [www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.02/smoking.html "Come to LeBow Country"] Wired, February 2003&lt;/ref&gt; GMO crops do not conflict with the Amish lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whybiotech.com/index.asp?id=3947 |title=Amish Farmers Grow Biotech Tobacco, Potatoes |publisher=[[Council for Biotechnology Information]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101163233/http://www.whybiotech.com/index.asp?id=3947 |date=n.d.|archivedate=2008-01-01 |accessdate=2008-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2015}}

===Rastafarian===
While the Rastafari Movement as a whole has no central authority, a Rastafari Code of Conduct was ratified in July–August 2008 at a meeting in Jamaica of the [[Rastafari movement#Nyahbinghi Order|Nyah Binghi]] Order, one of the three houses of the Rastafari movement;  that Code defines GM food as not [[Ital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rastafarivisions.com/therastafaricodeofconduct |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524054026/http://www.rastafarivisions.com/therastafaricodeofconduct |archivedate=2013-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History  ==
The idea of constituting a National Academy of Letters in India was considered by the colonial British government, and in 1944 a proposal from the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal for the formation of a 'National Cultural Trust' was, in principle, accepted. The original plan conceived of three institutions, or academies, devoted to the visual arts, performing arts, and letters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The independent Government of India carried out this proposal, constituting a National Academy of Letters, called the 'Sahitya Akademi' by a government resolution on 15 December 1952.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first General Council of the Akademi included members such as [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|S. Radhakrishnan]], [[Abul Kalam Azad]], [[C. Rajagopalachari]], [[K. M. Panikkar|K.M. Panikkar]], [[Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi|K.M. Munshi]], [[Zakir Husain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]], [[Umashankar Joshi]], [[Mahadevi Varma]], [[D. V. Gundappa]], [[Ramdhari Singh Dinkar]], and was presided over by the then-Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Government of India clarified that the choice of Prime Minister Nehru as the first chairperson was "not because he is Prime Minister, but because he has carved out for himself a distinctive place as a writer and author."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Sahitya Akademi was formally inaugurated on 12 March 1954 in New Delhi. A ceremony was held in the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]]'s Central Hall, with speeches by Maulana [[Abul Kalam Azad]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|S. Radhakrishnan]]. S. Radhakrishnan elaborated on the purpose of the Sahitya Akademi in his speech, noting that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The phrase, Sahitya Akademi, combines two words. 'Sahitya' is Sanskrit, and 'Academy' is Greek. This name suggests our universal outlook and aspiration. Sahitya is a literary composition; Academy is an assembly of men who are interested in the subject. So Sahitya Akademi will be an assembly of all those who are interested in creative and critical literature. It is the purpose of this Akademi to recognise men of achievement in letters, to encourage men of promise in letters, to educate public taste and to improve standards of literature and literary criticism."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A key concern in the early days of the Sahitya Akademi was the establishment of its autonomy from the Central Government. This concern was echoed by the Prime Minister, who noted that, "...it is an honour to be the President of an organisation which includes it in its fold the eminent writers of India in various languages. As President of that Akademi I may tell you quite frankly, I would not like the Prime Minister to interfere in my work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Council made recommendations to amend the Akademi's governing constitution, including proposals to have the chairman elected by the Council and not appointed by the Government.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these suggestions were incorporated, and the Akademi was constituted as a society under the Societies Registration Act of 1860, as it had not originally been incorporated by an Act of Parliament, but by an executive order.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Council was reconstituted and elected Prime Minister Nehru as its president, and he continued in that capacity until his death in 1964.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequent presidents of the Sahitya Akademi have included [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|S. Radhakrishnan]] (1958) who succeeded Jawaharlal Nehru after serving as the Vice-President along with him; [[Zakir Husain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]] (1963); [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji|Suniti Kumar Chatterjee]] (1967); [[K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar|K.R. Srinivasa Iyengar]] (1969, and re-elected in 1973); [[Umashankar Joshi]] (1978); [[Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya]] (1983); [[U. R. Ananthamurthy]] (1993); [[Ramakanta Rath]] (1998); and [[Gopi Chand Narang]] (2003).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.

The Sahitya Akademi periodically holds International Seminars, sometimes in collaboration with the [[Indian Council for Cultural Relations]]. The first international seminar was held in 1961, in New Delhi, to mark 100 years since the birth of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. About 25 writers from 16 countries, along with 39 writers from India met over four days to discuss and commemorate Tagore's works. Attendees included [[Aldous Huxley]], [[Martin Wickramasinghe|Martin Wickremesinghe]], [[Jean Guéhenno|Jean Guehenno]], [[Zaki Naguib Mahmoud]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], and [[Louis Untermeyer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=62–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Amrita Pritam]], Ramdhari Sinha Dinkar, Rayaprolu Subba Rao, and [[Premendra Mitra]]. In 1991, the Akademi organised a second International Seminar on Tagore in collaboration with the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], the [[Lalit Kala Akademi]] and the [[Indian Council for Cultural Relations]].

The Akademi's second International Seminar in 1975 was also held in New Delhi and focused on the Ramayana tradition in Asia. Participants, including U Thein Han, Soewito Santoso, Harry M. Buck, C.E. Godakumbra, Kapila Vatsyayan, Camille Bulke and Umashankar Joshi, presented 44 papers on Ramayana traditions, which were published by the Akademi in a commemorative volume.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second International seminar on the same theme was held in New Delhi in 1981.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Samvatsar Annual Lecture ====
The Samvatsar Annual Lecture is organised by the Sahitya Akademi and is delivered during the Akademi's Annual Festival of Letters. The Sahitya Akademi notes that these lectures "should open up new vistas of thinking regarding a literary movement, a current literary trend, some original thinking about a great writer or a great classic or a new path in literary criticism or literary creation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/literaray-activities/samvatar_lectures.jsp|title = Sahitya Akademi: Samvatsar Lectures|date = 26 November 2014|accessdate = |website = Sahitya Akademi|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lectures have been delivered since 1986 by people including the Hindi writer [[Sachchidananda Vatsyayan]] (1986), Marathi poet and writer [[Vinda Karandikar]] (1991), Assamese novelist [[Nabakanta Barua]] (1994), and Malayalam author and director, [[M T Vasudevan Nair]] (1999).&lt;ref name="Samvatsar Lectures"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/literaray-activities/samvatar_lectures.jsp|title = Samvatsar Lectures|date = |accessdate = 26 November 2014|website = Sahitya Akademi|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies and Parliamentary Committee reviews ==

There have been widespread allegations of corruption and controversial appointments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balakrishnan|first1=Deepa|title=Sahitya Akademi in Ruins Literally|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/sahitya-academy-in-ruins-literally/12569-3-1.html|work=IBN Live|date=9 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the Presidency of [[Gopi Chand Narang]] who headed Sahitya Akademi from 2003 to 2007 and the current President Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?230676 |title=Bibliofile |website=Outlookindia.com |date=2006-03-27 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924140059/http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?230676 |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?223217 |title=Bibliofile |website=Outlookindia.com |date=2004-03-15 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924140047/http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?223217 |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agrahara Krishnamurthy, appointed as the Secretary of Sahitya Akademi by Narang, had undergone a CBI probe in a paper purchase scam at the time of his appointment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?231485 |title=War And No Peace |website=Outlookindia.com |date=2006-06-05 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924140101/http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?231485 |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was censured and forced to retire after being accused of financial irregularities in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/274600/probe-against-agrahara.html |title=Probe against Agrahara |website=Deccanherald.com |date=2012-08-27 |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hc-stays-penalty-imposed-on-poet/article6190727.ece |title=HC stays penalty imposed on poet |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=2014-07-09 |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agrahara Krishnamurthy who has been granted relief by the High Court&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nandakumar|first1=Pratibha|title=Truth prevails|url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/entertainment/lounge/Truth-prevails/articleshow/38998241.cms|work=Bangalore Mirror|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; has alleged a conspiracy against him by a cabal of writers and officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conspiracy behind my ouster: Agrahara Krishnamurthy|url=http://mathrubhuminews.in/ee/ReadMore/8251/conspiracy-behind-ousting-agrahara-krishnamoorthy/E|work=Matrubhumi News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment by a committee composed of Narang, Tiwari and others of the current Secretary K. Sreenivasa Rao, is controversial as Rao’s academic credentials for the top job, who had joined the Akademi as a lower division clerk (LDC), are said to be insufficient and extremely dubious.

The 171st Parliamentary Standing Committee on the functioning of Sahitya Akademi and three other institutions chaired by [[Sitaram Yechury]] and tabled at the [[Loksabha]] in August 2011 states, "It was felt that most of these institutions were not able to live up to the original mandates set out by their founding fathers. Controversies of different kind involving these institutions that keep cropping up from time to time, had caught this Committee’s attention. Questions were also raised about the indifference and helplessness shown by the [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Ministry of Culture]] to do anything in the face of autonomy enjoyed by these institutions."

The Committee also urged Sahitya Akademi to adopt the recommendation of the [[P. N. Haksar|Haksar]] Committee (1988) of having its head appointed by the President of India, a practice followed by [[Sangeet Natak Akademi|Sangeet Natak]] and [[Lalit Kala Akademi|Lalit Kala]] Akademies, to avoid "the inevitable complications of the existing system of elections."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=171st Report of Parliamentary Committee|url=http://www.rgics.org/test/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Functioning-of-Sahitya-Akadem-Lalit-Kala-Akademi-Sangeet-Natak-Akademi-and-National-School-of-Drama.pdf|publisher=Rajya Sabha Secretariat, New Delhi|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084016/http://www.rgics.org/test/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Functioning-of-Sahitya-Akadem-Lalit-Kala-Akademi-Sangeet-Natak-Akademi-and-National-School-of-Drama.pdf|archivedate=2014-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversial appointments ===

Many controversial appointments of unqualified candidates to key positions at the Sahitya Akademi, done during [[Gopi Chand Narang]]'s time, continue unchallenged to this day. Khurshid Alam and Mrignayani Gupta, both dismissed in 2004 for presenting counterfeit degree certificates, have made a backdoor entry and have been subsequently promoted to higher positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Srivastava|first1=Mihir|title=Scam charges cloud Sahitya Akademi|url=http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main7.asp?filename=Ne103004scame_charges.asp|agency=Tehelka|date=30 October 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115454/http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main7.asp?filename=Ne103004scame_charges.asp|archivedate=26 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been widespread allegations in the Hindi press that the certificates of the current secretary, K. Sreenivasa Rao, who completed his M.Phil and PhD degrees while being employed as Deputy Secretary (Administration) at the Sahitya Akademi without availing a single day's leave, are fake and fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thakur|first1=Sunderchand|title=साहित्य अकादमी में फिर विवादास्पद नियुक्ति|url=http://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1535663.cms|agency=Nav Bharat Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appeals by the writers community to the Ministry of Culture to launch an inquiry have not yielded any result.

=== Sahitya Akademi Awards controversy ===

It has been alleged time and again that the procedure of nomination of litterateurs for the coveted [[Sahitya Akademi Award]]s is not transparent. The ground-list of books (from which the jury members make two short-lists and the final selection for the award) is supposed to be made by the General Council. But the books are provided to this council by the bureaucrats and employees of the Akademi who are allegedly unqualified to make any kind of literary selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Y.P. Rajesh|first1=Amit Prakash,|title=The Literary Mafia|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/The-Literary-Mafia/200102|work=Outlook Magazine|date=1 Nov 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the award regulations makes the recommendations of the Language Advisory Board mandatory, the recommendations of the board are often dismissed and ignored by the officials without citing any reason. This lack of transparency and rigour in the selection process has resulted in a lot of controversy. It has even resulted in writers being forced to return the award when it has been proven that the selection procedure was fraudulent, as was the case with the Sahitya Akademi award for a translation into [[Oriya language|Oriya]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Probe sought into Sahitya Akademi affairs|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/probe-sought-into-sahitya-akademi-affairs/article728959.ece|work=The Hindu|date=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Writer's plan to return Sahitya Akademi award sparks row|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/writers-plan-to-return-sahitya-akademi-award-sparks-row/article581860.ece|work=The Hindu|date=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sahitya Akademi is also highly criticized by writers such as [[Khushwant Singh]] for ignoring eminent writers and awarding below-par writers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singh|first1=Khushwant|title=Prize manipulators: Sahitya Akademi under fire for awarding 'below par' authors|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/controversy-over-the-1991-sahitya-akademis-choice-of-author-exposes-its-flawed-functioning/1/308420.html|work=India Today|date=2 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sub-standard literary works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mrunalini|first1=C|title=Draupadi’s unending circle of suffering|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/books/article225606.ece?service=print|work=The New Indian Express|date=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lulla|first1=Anil Budur|title=Disrobing Draupadi|url=http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/art-culture/disrobing-draupadi|work=Open Magazine|date=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sensation Young British Artists from the Saatchi Collection at the Brooklyn Museum 15.jpg|thumb|267x267px|''Sensation'' installed at [[Brooklyn Museum]] (October 1999  – January 2000)]]
'''''Sensation''''' was an exhibition of the collection of contemporary art owned by [[Charles Saatchi]], including many works by [[Young British Artists]], (YBAs), which first took place 18 September – 28 December 1997 at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London and later toured to the [[Hamburger Bahnhof]] in Berlin and the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in New York City. A proposed showing at the [[National Gallery of Australia]] was cancelled when the gallery's director decided the exhibition was "too close to the market."

The show generated controversy in London and New York City due to the inclusion of images of [[Myra Hindley]] and the [[Virgin Mary]]. It was criticised by New York City mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] and others for attempting to boost the value of the work by showing it in institutions and public museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/093099brooklyn-museum.html |title=Brooklyn Museum Accused of Trying to Lift Art Value |first=David M. |last=Herszenhorn |date=30 September 1999 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

The artworks in ''Sensation'' were from the collection of [[Charles Saatchi]], a leading collector, advertising mogul and publiciser of contemporary art. [[Norman Rosenthal]], the Royal Academy of Arts exhibitions secretary, helped to stage the 110 works by 42 different artists.  Many of the pieces had already become famous, or notorious, with the British public (for example, [[Damien Hirst]]'s [[shark]] suspended in [[formaldehyde]] titled ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', [[Tracey Emin]]'s tent titled ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995]]''), [[Marc Quinn]]'s self-portrait (a frozen head made from pints of his own blood) and [[Sarah Lucas]]'s explicitly sexual images and sculptures. Others had already achieved prominence in other ways, such as a successful advertising campaign using an idea from [[Gillian Wearing]]'s photographs. ''Sensation'' was the first time that a wide audience had had the chance to see these works en masse. The Royal Academy posted this disclaimer to visitors on entry:
{{quote|There will be works of art on display in the Sensation exhibition which some people may find distasteful. Parents should exercise their judgment in bringing their children to the exhibition. One gallery will not be open to those under the age of 18.''&lt;ref name="Dalry"/&gt;}}

==London==
[[File:Burlington House-Courtyard.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Academy of Arts]], London|306x306px]]The opening of ''Sensation'' at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] caused a public furore and a media frenzy, with both [[broadsheet]] and [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] journalists falling over themselves to comment on the show's controversial images, and unprecedented crowds queuing up to see for themselves what all the fuss was about.  Around a quarter of the RA's 80 academicians gave a warning that the exhibition was inflammatory.  They and some members of the public complained about several other exhibits, notably the installations by [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], which were of child mannequins with noses replaced by penises and mouths in the form of an anus.

However, the biggest media controversy was over ''[[Myra (painting)|Myra]]'', an image of the murderer [[Moors murders|Myra Hindley]] by [[Marcus Harvey]].&lt;ref name="Dalry"&gt;{{citation |last=Dalrymple |first=Theodore |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/8_1_urbanities-trash.html |title=Trash, Violence, and Versace: But Is It Art? |magazine=City Journal |date=Winter 1998 |accessdate=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mothers Against Murder and Aggression protest group picketed the show, accompanied by Winnie Johnson, the mother of one of Hindley's victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Alberge |first=Dalya |title=Attacks force Hindley portrait to be moved |newspaper=The Times |date=19 September 1997 |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F924CA724CFF0B6&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=1054640702C8DBC0 |subscription=yes |accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They asked for the portrait, which is made up of hundreds of copies of a child's handprint, to be excluded to protect Johnson's feelings. Along with supporters she picketed the show's first day. Myra Hindley sent a letter from jail suggesting that her portrait be removed from the exhibition, reasoning that such action was necessary because the work was "a sole disregard not only for the emotional pain and trauma that would inevitably be experienced by the families of the Moors victims but also the families of any child victim."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lyall |first=Sarah |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CEEDD1F38F933A1575AC0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Art That Tweaks British Propriety] |newspaper=New York Times |date=20 September 1997 |accessdate=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, Alison. "Judging the Image: Art, Value, Law". Routledge, January, 2005. p. 34. {{ISBN|0-415-30183-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all the protest the painting remained hanging.  Windows at Burlington House, the Academy's home, were smashed and two demonstrators hurled ink and eggs at the picture as a result, requiring it to be removed and restored. It was put back on display behind [[Perspex]]&lt;ref name=storm&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/455902.stm "Sensation sparks New York storm"], [[BBC]], 23 September 1999. Retrieved 17 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and guarded by security men.

In a press conference on 16 September 1997, David Gordon, Secretary of the Royal Academy commented on the controversial portrait: "The majority view inside the Academy was that millions and millions of images of Myra Hindley have been reproduced in newspapers and magazines. Books have been written about the murders. Television programmes have been made. Hindley’s image is in the public domain; part of our consciousness; an awful part of our recent social history; a legitimate subject for journalism – and for art."

The show was extremely popular with the general public, attracting over 300,000 visitors during its run,&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; helped by the media attention which the strong subject matter had received.  The BBC described it as "gory images of dismembered limbs and explicit pornography".&lt;ref name=limbs&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/43401.stm "Entertainment Sensational hit for Royal Academy"], [[BBC]], 30 December 1997. Retrieved 22 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berlin==
''Sensation'' was shown at the Berlin's [[Hamburger Bahnhof]] museum (30 September 1998 – 30 January 1999) and proved so popular that it was extended past its original closing date of 28 December 1998. For art critic Nicola Kuhn from ''Der Tagesspiegel'', there was "no sensation about Sensation". She claimed that the Berlin audience found the yBa's work "more sad and serious than irreverent, funny and dazzling"&lt;ref name="Hatton"&gt;Hatton, Rita and Walker, John.

==New York City==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum June 2008 sunset jeh.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
The exhibition was shown in New York City at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] from 2 October 1999 to 9 January 2000. The New York City show was met with instant protest, centring on ''[[The Holy Virgin Mary]]'' by [[Chris Ofili]], which had not provoked this reaction in London. While the press reported that the piece was "smeared", "splattered" or "stained" with elephant dung,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-pPe2HVNb08C&amp;pg=PA38 Judging the image: art, value, law], Alison Young, Routledge, 2005, {{ISBN|0-415-30184-X}}, p.38-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedlander&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ym1ADWLrWmwC&amp;pg=PA88 Feminine look: sexuation, spectatorship, subversion], Jennifer Friedlander, SUNY Press, 2008 {{ISBN|0-7914-7295-7}}, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Ofili's work in fact showed a carefully rendered black Madonna decorated with a resin-covered lump of elephant dung. The figure is also surrounded by small collaged images of female genitalia from pornographic magazines; these seemed from a distance to be the traditional [[cherubim]].

New York City Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]], who had seen the work in the catalogue but not in the show, called it "sick stuff" and threatened to withdraw the annual $7&amp;nbsp;million City Hall grant from the [[Brooklyn Museum]] hosting the show, because "You don't have a right to government subsidy for desecrating somebody else's religion."&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; [[Cardinal John O'Connor]], the [[Archbishop of New York]], said, "one must ask if it is an attack on religion itself," and the president of America's biggest group of Orthodox Jews, Mandell Ganchrow, called it "deeply offensive".&lt;ref name=whiff&gt;{{citation |last1=Davies |first1=Hugh |last2=Fenton |first2=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/10/02/wsen02.html |title=Whiff of sensation hits New York |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2 October 1999 |accessdate=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William A. Donohue]], President of the [[Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights]], said the work "induces revulsion".&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; Giuliani started a lawsuit to evict the museum, and Arnold Lehman, the museum director, filed a federal lawsuit against Giuliani for a breach of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt;

[[Hillary Clinton]] spoke up for the museum, as did the New York Civil Liberties Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/092899brooklyn-hillary.html |title=First Lady Assails Mayor Over Threat to Museum |first=Adam |last=Nagourney |publisher=New York Times |date=28 September 1999 |accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial board of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, Giuliani's stance "promises to begin a new Ice Age in New York's cultural affairs."&lt;ref name=nat&gt;Rapp, Christopher. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_20_51/ai_56220691 "Dung Deal – Brooklyn Museum of Art's "Sensation" exhibition"], ''[[National Review]]'', 25 October 1999. Retrieved 17 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper also carried a full-page advertisement in support signed by over 100 actors, writers and artists, including [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]] and [[Susan Sontag]].&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt; Ofili, who is Roman Catholic, said, "elephant dung in itself is quite a beautiful object."&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt;

The [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a nonbinding resolution to end federal funding for the museum on 3 October 1999, and New York City did stop funding to the Brooklyn Museum.  On 1 November, federal judge [[Nina Gershon]] ordered the City not only to restore the funding that was denied to the Museum, but also to refrain from continuing its ejectment action.  On 16 December 1999, a 72-year-old man was arrested for criminal mischief after smearing the Ofili painting with white paint, which was soon removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_2_88/ai_59450150/ |magazine=Art in America |title=Vandal Attacks Ofili Madonna |date=February 2000 |accessdate=20 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120055422/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_2_88/ai_59450150/ |archive-date=20 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The museum produced a yellow stamp, saying the artworks on show "may cause shock, vomiting, confusion, panic, euphoria and anxiety."&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt; and Ofili's painting was shown behind a Plexiglass screen, guarded by a museum attendant and an armed police officer.&lt;ref name=nat/&gt; Jeffrey Hogrefe, art critic for the ''[[New York Observer]]'', commented about the museum, "They wanted to get some publicity and they got it. I think it was pretty calculated."&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; The editor-in-chief of the New York City ''[[Art &amp; Auction]]'' magazine, Bruce Wolmer,said: "When the row eventually fades the only smile will be on the face of Charles Saatchi, a master self-promoter."&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt;

==Australia==
The show was scheduled to open in June 1999 at the [[National Gallery of Australia]], but was cancelled with the director, Brian Kennedy, saying that, although it was due to be funded by the Australian government, it was "too close to the market" since finance for the Brooklyn exhibition included $160,000 from Saatchi, who owned the work; $50,000 from [[Christie's]], who had sold work for Saatchi; and $10,000 from dealers of many of the artists.&lt;ref name=vogeloz&gt;Vogel, Carol.

Retrieved 17 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy said he was unaware of this when he accepted the show. Saatchi's contribution, the largest single one, was not disclosed by the [[Brooklyn Museum]], until it appeared in court documents.&lt;ref name=vogeloz/&gt; Similarly, when the show opened in London at the Royal Academy, there had been criticisms that it would raise the value of the work.&lt;ref name=vogeloz/&gt;

The '''''Singing Ringing Tree''''' is a [[wind power]]ed [[sound sculpture]] resembling a [[tree]] set in the landscape of the [[Pennines|Pennine]] hill range overlooking [[Burnley]], in [[Lancashire]], England.

Completed in 2006, it is part of the series of four sculptures within the [[Panopticons]] arts and regeneration project created by the East Lancashire Environmental Arts Network (ELEAN). The project was set up to erect a series of 21st-century landmarks, or Panopticons (structures providing a comprehensive view), across East [[Lancashire]] as symbols of the [[renaissance]] of the area.

Designed by architects Mike Tonkin and Anna Liu of Tonkin Liu, the ''Singing Ringing Tree'' is a 3-metre tall construction comprising pipes of [[galvanised steel]] which harness the energy of the wind to produce a slightly [[discordant]] and penetrating [[choral]] sound covering a range of several [[octave]]s. Some of the pipes are primarily structural and visual elements, while others have been cut across their width enabling the sound. The [[Harmony|harmonic]] and singing qualities of the tree were produced by tuning the pipes according to their length by adding holes to the underside of each.

In 2007, the sculpture won (along with 13 other candidates) the National Award of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) for architectural excellence.

In March 2017, a second Singing Ringing Tree was set on the outskirts of Austin, Texas in the United States in the rural area of a small town called Manor.

'''''St. George''''' or '''''St. George and the Dragon''''' is a small [[painting]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]]. It is housed in the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]]. A later version of the same subject is the ''[[St. George and the Dragon (Raphael)|St. George]]'' in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

==History==
This painting and the equally small ''[[St. Michael (Raphael)|Saint Michael]]'', also in the [[Louvre]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/saint-michael-overwhelming-demon Louvre entry]&lt;/ref&gt; are a pair. In the [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]] Collection they were joined together, forming a [[diptych]], and bound in leather. [[Louis XIV]] acquired them from [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]]'s heirs in 1661.&lt;ref name="ChamplinPerkins1913"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Champlin|first1=John Denison|author2=Charles Callahan Perkins|authorlink2=Charles Callahan Perkins|title=Cyclopedia of painters and paintings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KUaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA258|accessdate=26 June 2010|year=1913|publisher=C. Scribner's sons|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Saint George'' has sometimes been ascribed to the artist's Roman period, because the horse resembles one of the horses of [[Horse Tamers|Monte Cavallo]] (the [[Quirinal Palace]]). However, Raphael could easily have known this particular horse from a drawing of it, done by one of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]'s pupils.&lt;ref name="Muntz2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Muntz|first=Eugene|authorlink=Eugene Muntz|title=Raphael: His Life, Works, and Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pO7GkO4soMgC&amp;pg=PA176|accessdate=26 June 2010|date=May 2005 (originally 1888)|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-9396-3|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; To judge by the still somewhat naïve and [[Perugino|Peruginesque]] style of the painting, it is really one of Raphael's early works, dating from about 1504. He did another painting of the same subject a little later (the mentioned panel in Washington D. C.), and towards the end of his life he painted a large ''[[St. Michael Vanquishing Satan (Raphael)|Sant Michael]]'' which is also in the [[Louvre]].

Giovanni Lomazzo, in his ''Trattato della Pittura'' (1584), mentions a ''Saint George'' by Raphael, commissioned by the [[Duke of Urbino]], which was painted on a little chess-board (''tavoliere''). According to the old catalogues the small ''Saint Michael'', if not the saint George as well, had a draught-board on the back which is now covered over.&lt;ref&gt;G. P. Lomazzo, ''Trattato Dell' Arte Della Pittura Scultura Ed Architettura'', (reprint) Kessinger Publishing (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Examination by means of X-rays and infrared has not confirmed this statement. In the abovementioned book, Lomazzo seems to have confused various pictures of the same subject.&lt;ref name="Cartwright2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cartwright|first=Julia|title=Early Work of Raphael|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kTtIHgsS1tQC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=26 June 2010|date=18 October 2006|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4254-9624-1|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one can rely to some extent on his late and somewhat muddled testimony, it is possible that the two paintings in the Louvre were painted for the [[Duke of Urbino]].

The [[Uffizi Gallery]] has a pen-and-wash cartoon for the ''Saint George'' (seen here below).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2629">'''Strings of Freedom''' is an orchestra in the [[West Bank]] town of [[Jenin]]. It was founded by an Israeli Arab, Wafaa Younis, who travels regularly from her home in central Israel to teach music to children in Jenin.&lt;ref name='Concert'&gt;{{cite news | first = Isabel | last = Kershner | authorlink = Isabel Kershner | title = Concert for Holocaust Survivors Is Condemned | date = 2009-03-29 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/world/middleeast/30mideast.html | work = [[New York Times]] | accessdate = 2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holocaust survivor incident==
In 2009, Younis arranged for some of the young musicians to travel to [[Holon]], [[Israel]] to play for a concert for a group of [[Holocaust]] survivors.&lt;ref name='Concert'/&gt;

Following the concert in Holon, the house that Younis rented and used as a music studio was sealed and she was briefly barred form working in Jenin. The Popular Committee, "a grass-roots group representing the Palestine Liberation Organization," told journalists that said the young musicians had been exploited by the orchestra director, Wafaa Younis, for the purpose of “normalizing” ties with Israel. He told the New York Times that the children had been “deceived” and dragged unwittingly into a political situation that “served enemy interests” and aimed to “destroy the Palestinian national spirit in the camp.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = James | last = Taranto | authorlink = James Taranto | title = Violence, Not Violins | date = 2009-03-30 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123836428386167255 | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] | accessdate = 2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='jpost'&gt;{{cite news | title = PA dismantles W.

After a short period of time, Younis was allowed by the PA to return to the camp and continue teaching children and conducting the orchestra. In her words, "This is my family, here in the Jenin Camp. I love them so much and they love me back." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=adigal |url=http://historyviolins.blogspot.com/2009/07/we-are-muslims-god-created-us-to-have.html |title=History and Violins: "We are Muslims.

Morisot employed a rather unusual palette in this painting.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford D, Kirby J, Leighton, J., Roy A. Art in the Making: Impressionism. National Gallery Publications, London, 1990, pp. 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt; She painted the dark blue coat of the woman on the right with [[cerulean blue]] which was rarely used by the Impressionists. The green foliage is painted in a mixture of [[Paris green|emerald green]], [[viridian]], [[lead white]] and [[cadmium yellow]]. Cadmium yellow was not yet widely used at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/morisot-summers-day/ Illustrated pigment analysis] of B.

==The paradigm==
[[Image:Syd Field2.jpg|thumb|right|Field in an instructional video]]
Field's most notable contribution is his paradigm "[[three-act structure]]". In this structure, a writer sets a film's plot within the first twenty to thirty minutes. Then the [[protagonist]] experiences a '''''plot point''''', providing the protagonist with a goal. About half of a movie's running time focuses on the protagonist's struggle to achieve this goal. The second act is called the '''''confrontation'''''. Field also refers to the '''''midpoint''''', a turning point around the middle of the screenplay (such as on or around page 60 of a 120-page screenplay). This turning point is often a devastating reversal of the protagonist's fortune. The third act depicts the protagonist's struggle to achieve (or not achieve) his or her goal, as well as the aftermath.

{{Weather}}
In [[Middle Ages|medieval lore]], '''Tempestarii''' were weather making magicians who dwelt amongst the common people and possessed the power to raise or prevent storms at will. For this reason, anyone reputed as a weather-maker was the subject of respect, fear, and hatred in rural areas.

Perhaps the best known work on tempestarii was a 815 AD piece called "On Hail and Thunder" by a bishop, [[Agobard]] of Lyon.

Some describe it as a complaint of the irreligious beliefs of his flock, as villagers resented paying tithes to the church, but freely paid a form of insurance against storms to village ''tempestarii''; but, it was also noted, whenever a supposed weather-maker failed to prevent a storm, he or she would generally suffer the wrath of the populace, being victimised or killed.

A closer examination of Agobard's writing shows that he actually argues against the existence of weather-witches, but acquiesces that the saints of God are able to cause these things by praying with faith. He is more concerned with his flock's misunderstanding that these "witches" are obtaining power from the devil, and subsequent eagerness to kill or curse anyone able to work miracles. His key argument is that anyone capable of "raising a gale" would be one who has faith in God, a Christian, not a witch, because witches are not able to do such things.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Perhaps the ones who attribute the making of hail to men would say that Moses reached his staff up to heaven and in this sense the storm was sent by human agency. Certainly Moses, the servant of God, was good and righteous, but these people do not dare to say that the so-called ‘storm-makers’ are good and righteous, but rather evil and unrighteous, deserving of both temporal and eternal condemnation, nor are they servants of God, except perhaps by circumstance rather than willing service. For if there were men who could cause hail, in imitation of Moses, they would surely be servants of God, not servants of the devil; although the passages cited above show that neither servants of God nor those of the devil cause of hail, but only omnipotent God...

{{sic|hide=yes|Therefore}} no human assistant should be sought in such events, because none will be found, except perhaps the saints of God, who have brought about, and are yet to bring about, many things. Some of them have the power to close up the heavens, lest it rain on days when they are prophesying, like Elijah; and to change water into blood and torment the earth with every plague as many times as they wish, as Moses and Aaron did to Egypt. Truly no other person sends hail in the summer, other than the one who sends snow in the winter. For there is a single reason for both these occurrences, when clouds are at either time raised higher than usual.

...not like these half-faithful of ours, who, as soon as they hear thunder, or when there is a breath of light wind, say ‘a gale is raised’ and curse, saying, ‘Cursed be the tongue that did these things, and may it be dried up and now be cut off.’ Pray tell, whom are you cursing? A righteous man or a sinner? For a sinner, partly unbelieving like you, cannot raise a gale, as you put it, because he is not able to by his own strength, nor can he command evil angels (nor do evil angels even have power in these matters)." &lt;ref&gt;https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/Agobard-OnHailandThunder.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Agobard of Lyons also referenced a related belief amongst his parishioners—a belief that ''tempestarii'' were in league with a mythical race of cloud-dwellers who came from a land named '[[Magonia (mythology)|Magonia]]' ("Land of Magic", "Land of Thieves"). The Magonians were supposed to sail the skies in storm clouds; they would then pay [[Franks|Frankish]] ''tempestarii'' to summon up storms over farmlands, during which the Magonians could swoop down and steal the corn from the fields. On the particular occasion which prompted Agobard to write, several supposed Magonians had been taken prisoner by irate villagers shortly after a bad storm; the Bishop had been forced to intervene and debate with the villagers in order to save the prisoners' lives.

==Storm raising==
During the [[Witch-hunt|witch hunts]] the belief in witches who could raise storms was not limited to the Tempestarii. Depending on a witch's preference, they were believed to cause [[Storm|tempests]], [[hail]]storms, and [[lightning]]. Witches struck homes and crops alike, sank ships, killed men and animals, and it was believed they took great delight in the process. Church authorities gave credence to the belief by stating that [[God]] permitted the [[Devil]] and witches to perform these acts as punishment for the wickedness of the world.

Since ancient times around the world, the ability to control elements—including the raising of storms and causing rain—has been attributed to [[Magician (paranormal)|magicians]], [[Shamanism|shamans]], [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerers]], and [[Witchcraft|witches]]. As early as 700 A.D., the [[Catholic Church]] prosecuted sorcerers for causing storms.

The most famous storm believed to be caused by witches was recorded in 1591 during the [[North Berwick Witch Trials]]. [[John Fian]] and his alleged coven of witches were accused of raising a sea storm to drown [[James I of England|James VI]] and [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]] on their way from [[Denmark]].

On  the Tempestarii and Magonia see [[Valerie Flint|Valerie I. J. Flint]], ''The Rise of Magic in Early Medieval Europe'', Princeton Univ. Press, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;112.

==Remedies against tempestarii==
The Catholic Church prohibited [[Superstition|superstitious]] remedies against witchcraft such as storm raising because the remedies themselves were of [[Paganism|pagan]] origin. [[Prayer]], [[sacrament]]s, and the [[invocation]] of the name of God were prescribed instead with the belief that a person who had strong faith in God, kept the [[Ten Commandments|commandments]], and revered the [[rite]]s of the Church would be immune from storms and tempests raised by malicious witches.

Because many [[peasant]]s were reluctant to give up their superstitions as being false, the church also sanctioned remedies like the ringing of [[church bell]]s, believed to drive storm [[Demon|devils]] away, and placing [[Amulet|charms]] made from flowers consecrated on [[Palm Sunday]] in the crop fields. It was believed that if a storm did strike after the charm was placed, the owner's crops would be protected even if the surrounding land and crops were destroyed.

'''''The Ambidextrous Universe''''' is a [[popular science]] book by [[Martin Gardner]], covering aspects of [[symmetry]] and [[asymmetry]] in human culture, science and the wider [[universe]].

Originally published in 1964, it underwent revisions in 1969, 1979, 1990 and 2005 (the last two are known as the "Third, revised edition"). Originally titled '' The Ambidextrous Universe: Mirror Asymmetry and Time-Reversed Worlds'', subsequent editions are known as ''The New Ambidextrous Universe: Symmetry and Asymmetry from Mirror Reflections to Superstrings''.

==Content==
The book begins with the subject of [[mirror reflection]], and from there passes through symmetry in [[geometry]], [[poetry]], [[art]], [[music]], [[galaxy|galaxies]], [[sun]]s, [[planet]]s and [[living organisms]]. It then moves down into the [[molecule|molecular scale]] and looks at how symmetry and asymmetry have evolved from the beginning of life on [[Earth]]. There is a chapter on [[carbon]] and its versatility and on [[chirality]] in [[biochemistry]]. Chapter 18 (and subsequent chapters) deals with a conundrum called the Ozma Problem (see below). The second half of the book concerns various aspects of [[Atomic physics|atomic]] and [[subatomic]] physics and how they relate to mirror asymmetry and the related concepts of chirality, [[antimatter]], [[magnetic polarity|magnetic]] and [[electrical polarity]], [[Parity (physics)|parity]], [[Charge (physics)|charge]] and [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. [[Time invariance]] (and [[T-symmetry|reversal]]) is discussed. Implications for [[particle physics]], [[theoretical physics]] and [[cosmology]] are covered and brought up to date (in later editions of the book) with regard to [[Grand Unified Theory|GUT]]s, [[Theory of everything|TOE]]s, [[superstring theory]] and [[M-theory]].

===The Ozma Problem===
The 18th chapter, "The Ozma Problem", poses a problem that Gardner claims would arise if Earth should ever enter into communication with life on another planet through [[Project Ozma]]. This is the problem of how to communicate the meaning of left and right, where the two communicants are conditionally not allowed to view any one object in common. The problem was first implied in [[Immanuel Kant|Immanuel Kant's]] discussion of left and right, and [[William James]] mentioned it in his chapter on "The Perception of Space" in ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890). It is also mentioned by [[Charles Howard Hinton]]. Gardner follows the thread of several false leads on the road to the solution of the Ozma Problem, in each case presenting an apparent solution which, on closer examination, turns out to be a false one.

The solution to the Ozma Problem was finally embodied in the famous "[[Wu experiment]]", conducted in 1956 by Chinese-American physicist [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] (1912–1997), involving the [[beta decay]] of [[cobalt-60]]. This experiment was the first to disprove the conservation of [[parity (physics)|parity]]. At long last, according to Gardner, it is believed that one could carefully describe the Wu experiment to a distant extraterrestrial intelligence and thereby convey the exact meaning of left/right.

==Literary references==
===W.H. Auden===
[[W. H. Auden]] alludes to ''The Ambidextrous Universe'' in his poem "Josef Weinheber" (1965).

===Vladimir Nabokov===
'''''Pale Fire'''''&lt;br&gt;
In the original 1964 edition of ''The Ambidextrous Universe'', Gardner quoted two lines of poetry from [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s 1962 novel ''[[Pale Fire]]'' which are supposed to have been written by a poet, "[[John Shade]]", who is actually fictional. As a joke, Gardner credited the lines only to Shade and put Shade's name in the index as if he were a real person. In his 1969 novel ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle]]'', Nabokov returned the favor by having the character Van Veen "quote" the Gardner book along with the two lines of verse:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Space is a swarming in the eyes, and Time a singing in the ears," says John Shade, a modern poet, as quoted by an invented philosopher ("Martin Gardiner" {{sic}}) in ''The Ambidextrous Universe'', page 165 {{sic}}.&lt;ref&gt;Nabokov, Vladimir (1969), ''Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle'', [[McGraw-Hill|McGraw-Hill Book Company]], pg 577.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Look at the Harlequins!'''''&lt;br&gt;
Nabokov's 1974 novel ''[[Look at the Harlequins!]]'', about a man who can't distinguish left from right, was heavily influenced by his reading of ''The Ambidextrous Universe''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. Barton (1984), "The Ambidextrous Universe of Nabakov's ''Look at the Harlequins!''"; In: Roth, Phyllis (ed.), ''Critical Essays on Vladimir Nabokov''; G.K. Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayles, N. Katherine (1984), "Ambivalence: Symmetry, Asymmetry, and the Physics of Time Reversal in Nabokov's ''Ada''", in the same author's ''The Cosmic Web: Scientific Field Models and Literary Strategies in the Twentieth Century'', [[Cornell University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Judgement of Cambyses''''' is an [[oil on wood]] [[diptych]] by Dutch artist [[Gerard David]], depicting the arrest and [[flaying]] of the corrupt Persian judge [[Sisamnes]] on the order of [[Cambyses]], based on [[Herodotus]]' ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''. The diptych was commissioned in 1487/1488 by the municipal authorities of [[Bruges]] which requested a series of panels for the deputy [[burgomaster]]'s room in the [[town hall]].&lt;ref name="WGA"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/d/david/1/cambyse.html| title =The Judgment of Cambyses|publisher =Web Gallery of Art| accessdate = 29 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diptych was painted on [[oak]] panels and was first mentioned in the Bruges' archives as ''The Last Judgement''.&lt;ref name="WGA"/&gt; It was used by the town burghers to encourage honesty among the magistrates and as a symbolic public apology for the imprisonment of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in Bruges in 1488.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Lee | first =Phil | title =The Rough Guide to Bruges &amp; Ghent| publisher =Rough Guides | year =2002 | page = 40| isbn =1858288886}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top right corner of the flaying scene features Sisamnes' son dispensing justice from his father's chair, now draped with the flayed skin.

It is one of the few works by David that is not based on traditional religious themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = | first = | date = | editor1-last = Chilvers | editor1-first = Ian | title = The Oxford Dictionary of Art | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WYaRX58a0_IC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=%22The+Judgement+of+Cambyses%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJnI6KgvfaAhWytlkKHfO6ANYQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Judgement%20of%20Cambyses%22&amp;f=false | location = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 193 | isbn = 0198604769 | author-link = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also other paintings with the same subject, such as that by [[Dirck Vellert]] from 1542.

==Usage in protests==
David's ''The Judgement of Cambyses'' was used in August 2012 by the supporters of [[Yulia Timoshenko]] when they showed the reproduction of the work to the judge who was reviewing her case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://lenta.ru/news/2012/08/16/judge/| script-title=ru:Суд над Тимошенко задекорировали картиной "Сдирание кожи с продажного судьи"|publisher =[[Lenta.ru]]|language=Russian| accessdate = 29 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November of the same year two activists showed the reproduction of ''The Judgement of Cambyses'' to the judge Andrey Fedin, who convicted Maxim Luzyanin, involved in the [[Bolotnaya Square case]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2012/11/16/n_2619505.shtml| script-title=ru:Давидиса и активистку Архипову задержали за попытку вручить судье Лузянина картину "о продажности"|publisher =[[Gazeta.ru]]|language=Russian| accessdate = 29 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al-Iqtisād fī al-iʿtiqad''' ({{Lang-ar|الاقتصاد في الاعتقاد}}), or '''The Moderation in Belief''' is a major theological work by Abū Ḥāmid Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad [[al-Ghazali]].&lt;ref name="ucp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo16220536.html|title=Al-Ghazali’s "Moderation in Belief" |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Hourani]] indicated that the ''Iqtisad'' and ''[[Mizan al-amal]]'' were completed before or during
Ghazali's crisis of faith. It led him to abandon his notorious post at the [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad|Niẓamiyya school]] in [[Baghdad]] and enter the path of [[Tasawwuf]]. In it, he offers what scholars consider as the best defence of the [[Ash'arite]] school of Islamic theology. He also expressed strong reservations about a theology based on [[taqlid]] and marked by [[polemics]]. In this book, Ghazali makes an attempt to respond to the extreme literalists and the [[Muʿtazilites]]. It is the balance between reason and revelation that led to the title of book ''The Moderation in Belief''.&lt;ref name="ucp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ghazali.org/articles/gz-iranica.htm|title=Al-Ghazali from Encyclopedia Iranica|website=www.ghazali.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ghazali.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ghazali.org/books/Iqtisad%20Dissertation%20final.pdf |title=Al-ghazālī on Divine Essence: A Translation from The Iqtiṣād Fī Al-iʿtiqad with Notes and Commentary |publisher=ghazali.org |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
Ghazali begins the book with praise for God and importance of [[revelation]]. On one hand, he says,
a person who is not guided by reason will misunderstand the revelation while on the
other hand a [[rationalist]] may exceed the limits leading to rejection of the plain meaning of
revelation. The right course, he says, is to reconcile reason with revelation, one that puts reason at the service of understanding and then interprets the revelation. Reason, together
with the Revelation, is light upon light as mentioned in [[Quran]] chapter 24, verse 35.
Next comes an explanatory chapter with its four introductions and four main sections. Ghazali's
main topic throughout is in praise of God, depicting it as a work of theology.&lt;ref name="ghazali.org"/&gt;

== Translations ==
A translation into English of the first sections was published as a dissertation by Dennis Morgan Davis Jr. in 2005.&lt;ref name="ghazali.org"/&gt;

The first complete English-language edition of was made by Aladdin M. Yaqub, and published by the University of Chicago Press in 2013.&lt;ref name="ucp" /&gt;

Soon however, he falls in love with one of the girls, Anna, whom he impregnates. Sergey finds a purse on a train which he steals, giving the money to Anna for a makeshift abortion. Much later, Sergey follows one of the teachers home, knocks him unconscious, and robs him, giving the substantial sum to Anna and then raping her. Anna gets an abortion, and they set apart over time. One of the gangmasters prepare to send the two girls to Italy, but Sergey ruins Anna's passport and is eventually beaten by King and his gang. Sergey later retaliates by crushing their heads with their nightstands in their sleep.

==Reception==
''The Tribe'' received widespread critical acclaim by critics, audiences and at festivals all over the world. Film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 86% of critics gave the film a "Certified Fresh" rating, based on 92 reviews with an [[Weighted mean|average score]] of 7.5/10, with the consensus "A bleak, haunting drama whose wordless dialogue speaks volumes, The Tribe is a bold, innovative take on silent films for a contemporary audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tribe|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/plemya/?search=Plemya|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], another [[review aggregator]], assigned the film a weighted average score of 78 (out of 100) based on 27 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be "generally favorable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tribe|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-tribe|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' scored the piece four out of five stars, writing, "I can't stop thinking about it." while too praising  Slaboshpytskiy's ability to "[draw] on Samuel Beckett or Peter Brook to create a universal language of anxiety." while concluding the sentiment, "What an intriguing film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tribe review – deaf-school drama is shocking, violent and unique|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/17/the-tribe-review-deaf-mute-miroslav-slaboshpytskiy|accessdate=17 October 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie Felperin of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' praised the piece, stating, "The use of sign language, deafness and silence itself adds several heady new ingredients to the base material, alchemically creating something rich, strange and very original." He also admired the film's "silky smooth steadicam" cinematography of Vasyanovych. As well as comparing the language of gestures and body posture as "akin to watching a ballet like [[Coppélia]] or [[The Nutcracker]]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' heralded the film and its director, Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy, by stating: "Actions, emotions and desperate impulses speak far louder than words in The Tribe, a formally audacious coup de cinema that marks a stunning writing-directing debut for Ukrainian filmmaker [Slaboshpytskiy]." Chang was most praiseworthy of Vasyanovych's cinematography, Stepanskiy's sound design as "vividly detailed" and described Odudenko's production designs as "harshly lit corridors and graffiti-strewn exteriors". He also admired Novikova's "fire and vulnerability" as Anya.&lt;ref name="Film Review: The Tribe"/&gt;

Jonathan Romney of ''[[Film Comment]]'' granted the piece high acclaim, "[...] it was a thrill to discover something so bold, innovative, and downright wayward." Stating of the film, "[...] a magnificent example of long-take cinema". and calling it "an astonishing film". He continued by praising Slaboshpytskiy's risky endeavour, to which he "follows through with intrepidity and absolute rigor" as well as Vasyanovych’s "precise compositions". Romney further adds, "The Tribe, in short, was the most surprising, most inventive, and in many ways most disturbing film I’ve seen in Cannes this year." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Film of the Week: The Tribe|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/entry/cannes-2014-the-tribe-myroslav-slaboshpytskiy-semaine-de-la-critique|accessdate=23 May 2014|newspaper=[[Film Comment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later named the film among the best movies of 2014.&lt;ref name="The best films of 2014"/&gt;

Eric Kohn of ''[[indieWIRE]]'' gave the film an "A-" rating, adding, "While the specifics remain uncertain, it's never particularly difficult to keep up with the movie's pace, since their actions speak plainly enough -- and sometimes add far more expressiveness than any verbal exchanges could provide." Praising Slaboshpytskiy and Vasyanovych's usage of the steadicam approach, "capturing the actors' exchanges in their full-bodied entirety"; and Slaboshpytskiy as "brilliantly [developing] a suspenseful core through the mysteries of their conversations". He admired Grigory Fesenko's "body movements" and "precise details" through gestures.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Fred Topel wrote, in his review for ''[[CraveOnline]]'', "The piece de resistance is a taboo subject that unfolds in an elaborate single take. It was so harrowing I would have applauded if it would not have been completely inappropriate for the subject matter to do so." Topel praised the cast as "made up of non actors but you wouldn’t suspect that" adding, "They are full of life and energy" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fantastic Fest 2014 Review: ‘The Tribe’|url=http://www.craveonline.co.uk/film/reviews/763193-fantastic-fest-2014-review-tribe|accessdate=22 September 2014|newspaper=[[CraveOnline]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jessica Kiang of ''[[indieWIRE|The Playlist]]'' gave the film an "A-" rating and wrote, "It might sound glib, but it's the literal truth: "The Tribe" left us speechless." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cannes Review: Bizarre, Unsettling, Brilliant Critics’ Week Winner ‘The Tribe’|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/cannes-review-bizarre-unsettling-brilliant-critics-week-winner-the-tribe-20140528|accessdate=29 May 2014|newspaper=[[indieWIRE|The Playlist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Electric Sheep|Electric Sheep Magazine]]'''s Greg Klymkiw granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating "A sad, shocking and undeniably harrowing dramatic reflection of Ukraine with the searing truthful lens of a stylistic documentary treatment (at times similar to that of Austrian auteur [[Ulrich Seidl]])". He continues by commending that, "Visuals and actions are what drive the film and ultimately prove to be far more powerful than words ever could be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tribe|url=http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/reviews/2014/09/23/the-tribe/|accessdate=23 September 2014|newspaper=[[Electric Sheep]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luke Y. Thompson of ''[[List of assets owned by Village Voice Media|Topless Robot]]'' spoke most highly of the film, declaring, "Compelling, upsetting, brutal and brilliant, The Tribe is one of the best works of cinema of the year - a familiar template recreated in what, for most, will be an entirely new world." Too adding, "[...] this is a movie that will and should be used in [[film school|cinema schools]] as a master class in how film is a visual medium." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shape Shifters, Deaf Gangsters and More: 7 Upcoming Horror &amp; Crime Films Reviewed From AFI Fest|url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2014/11/shape_shifters_deaf_gangsters_and_more_7_upcoming.php?page=2|accessdate=19 November 2014|newspaper=[[List of assets owned by Village Voice Media|Topless Robot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venezuelan art''' has a long and eventful history. [[Venezuela]]'s [[museums]] and [[Art gallery|galleries]] are well on the way to forming a new discourse in which the public can experience and interact. Capturing the Venezuelan public view and interact with the installations and collections within a museum setting, re-establishes a new base for understanding the Venezuelan patron. This considered, the museum visitor is better understood and served as it is realized that a modern Venezuela, is represented as a diverse culture, intertwined with the traditional. The proactive cultural center strives to reacquaint itself with its audience, who in fact, are participants and beneficiaries of such cultural and heritage organizations. An effort by the Venezuelan government to connect its people to its cultural organizations, is a response to a cultural diversity and changes within.

Venezuelan art is gaining prominence. Initially dominated by religious motifs, it began emphasizing historical and heroic representations in the late nineteenth century, a move led by Martín Tovar y Tovar. Modernism took over in the twentieth century. Notable Venezuelan artists include Arturo Michelena, Cristóbal Rojas, Armando Reverón, Manuel Cabré, the kinetic artists Jesús-Rafael Soto and Carlos Cruz-Diez, the Meta-realism artist Pajaro and Yucef Merhi.

== Biography ==
'''Vladimir Stanislavovich Sakson''' was born May 17, 1927 in Leningrad, USSR. 
In 1939-1940, V. Sakson participated in a competition of children’s drawings held in the memory of Pushkin in which his works stood out and his artistic talents were recognized. He was admitted along with other gifted young artists to the art studio at the Pioneer Union under the direction of Professor M.A. Gorohova. Later, he was accepted into the Artist School at the Academy of Art. There he studied under the patronage of such great artists as [[Andrei Mylnikov]] and [[Olga Bogaevskaya]]. 
The Second World War dramatically interrupted V. Sakson’s studies and forced his maturation. It was under siege that he first learned that he had been born under a lucky star – a friend of his whom he had been holding was killed in his arms during the raid by a stray bullet. The second time V. Sakson learned of his lucky star was during the evacuation of Leningrad. He and his mother missed the car that was to have taken them out of the city. The car that they could not reach sunk under ice during its escape. V. Sakson and his mother managed to escape from the besieged city and were sent to Samarkand. 
After the war, the refugees returned to Leningrad and V. Sakson returned to art school to continue his studies.
In 1949 V. Sakson entered the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Ilya Repin Institute]]. During his studies he became involved with a traveling theater group, creating sets for their performances of Trembita and Free Wind. For his diploma project he created a set for the N. Rimsky-Korsakov play Sadko. ''&lt;ref&gt;Логвинова Е. В. Владимир Саксон. Живопись. СПб., 2007. С. 3, 77-80&lt;/ref&gt;'' 
In 1954 Sakson graduated from [[Repin Institute of Arts|Ilya Repin Institute]] in [[Mikhail Bobyshov]] workshop, where he also studied of Alexander Debler, [[Yuri Neprintsev]], Mikhail Platunov, Alexander Segal.

Since 1955 Vladimir Sakson has participated in Art Exhibitions. He painted portraits, landscapes, decorative compositions, worked as a thearte artist and in Art illustration. His first solo exhibition was opened in Saint Petersburg in 2007. Since 1960 Vladimir Sakson was a member of the [[Leningrad Union of Artists]]. 
V. Sakson began his career as a scenographer at Molotov Opera and Ballet Theater, now Perm Theater. Many of his sketches of costumes and decorations can be found in the theater’s archives. While working as a scenographer, he also found enjoyment in easel painting. 
Sakson enjoyed working as a book illustrator, working in lithographic studios illustrating children’s books. He created illustrations for poetry collections by V. Solouchin, B. Fedorov, and B. Kornilov. 
In the eighties V. Sakson was commissioned to create five murals for the Admiralteyskaya factory reflecting the glorious history of the Russian fleet. Unfortunately, the murals were destroyed and we can appreciate the unique character of this work only on the basis of archival drawings. ''&lt;ref&gt;Логвинова Е. В. Владимир Саксон. Живопись. СПб., 2007. С. 3, 72-76&lt;/ref&gt;'' 
Whether portraits or genre paintings, V. Sakson’s masterpieces are distinguished by their lyricism and delicacy. He was most inspired by nature. The exquisite scenery of Baikal, Tumen, Sayan, and Crimea became the sources for many of his successful works. He was also a passionate traveler and mountain climber. This passion for nature sometimes manifested itself in strange ways. Thus he could, following a sudden inner urge, travel to Kamchatka, only making known his disappearance by calling home when already far away. During his many cross-country journeys, he could always find interesting characters for his portraits. Attention to the faces in his portraits – whether of an old Uzbek potter or of a fashionista – yields their character’s personal traits, which attracted Sakson.

Vladimir Stanislavovich Sakson died on March 13, 1988 in Leningrad. His paintings reside in art museums and private collections in Russia, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, England, and other countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4424">'''Wycinanki''' ({{IPAc-pl|v|y|ć|i|'|n|a|N|k|J|i}}) in [[Poland]] or  '''Vytynanky''' (Витина́нки) in [[Ukraine]] or  '''Vycinanki''' (Выцінанкі) in [[Belarus]], are a [[Slavic culture|Slavic]] version of the art form of [[papercutting]], popular in Belarus, Poland, and Ukraine.

== Belarus ==
[[File:2009. Stamp of Belarus 34-2009-11-02-bl.jpg|thumb|[[Postage stamp]] from [[Belarus]] inspired by Vytynanky.]] 
Vycinanka is also known as vyrazanka or vystryhanka, Viačaslaŭ Dubinka was key in reviving in Belarus the folk art of paper cutting images with scissors.&lt;ref name="kurjer.info"&gt;http://kurjer.info/2010/05/12/vyachasla%D1%9E-dubinka-%E2%80%9Cvycinanka-lichylasya-durykami-a-ne-mastactvam%E2%80%9D&lt;/ref&gt; Repeatedly the winner of international competitions, he left behind thousands of images with this technique. His works have adorned calendars, business cards, notepads, postcards and other items.&lt;ref name="kurjer.info"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svaboda.org/content/article/2124897.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poland ==
[[Image:Wystroj-chaty-kurpie.JPG|thumb|Wycinanki from [[Kurpie]]]]

Polish wycinanki became a popular folk craft in the mid-1800s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polskiinternet.com/english/info/artpaper.html "Polish folk art -  Paper Cutout / Wycinanki," PolskiInternet, retrieved 2010-09-14]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wycinanki originated with [[shepherd]]s cutting designs out of [[tree bark]] and leather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sheldonbrown.org/joyce/wycinanki.html Wycinanky, Madelyn Joyce]&lt;/ref&gt; Colorful wycinanki were pasted on furniture or roof beams as decoration, hung in windows, and given as gifts.

Wycinanki vary by region. For example, wycinanki created in the [[Kurpie]] region are typically all one color, while wycinanki from the [[Łowicz]] region are multicolored.  Techniques include cutting, clipping, punching, tearing, and carving of paper, as well as ''nalepianki'' in which multiple layers are glued together.

Subject matter includes [[peacock]]s, [[rooster]]s, and other birds; circular or star-shaped [[medallion]]s (''gwiazdy''); flowers; and annual holidays such as Easter and Christmas. In some towns and villages competitions evolved to create the most beautiful wycinanki.  Traditionally done for relaxation in rural Poland, the techniques were passed down through generations, with new themes and ideas developing as the papercuttings became more detailed and intricate.

The [[Expo 2010 pavilions#Poland|Polish Pavilion]] at the [[2010 World Expo]] in [[Shanghai]] is based on a wycinanki design.

== Ukraine ==
Historical evidence suggests that vytynanky began to be made in Ukraine at the end of the fifteenth to early sixteenth [[century]], but it took quite some time before they became an integral part of the decorative arts practiced at the grass roots level. During the nineteenth century decorative paper cutouts spread all across the Ukrainian [[countryside]].&lt;ref name=index2.php/&gt;

The word itself, vytynanky, gained currency in the early twentieth century, but there were many other, regional words that were used too — stryhuntsi, khrestyky or kvity to mention but a few. The vytynanky shapes were of many kinds and represented stylized figures of [[people]], [[animals]] and [[plants]]. [[Ethnographer]]s and art historians began to study the art of vytynanky, and artists began to seek inspiration for their art in vytynanky. Articles and essays were published, vytynanky began to be collected. Vytynanky were displayed at exhibitions of the Ukrainian decorative and applied arts alongside traditional [[pottery]], [[embroidery]], [[carpet|rugs]] and other items.&lt;ref name=index2.php/&gt;

Vytynanky that were made for the occasions of religious feasts and holidays were more decorative than the ones used for everyday decoration. [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]] called for vytynanky in the shapes of angels, churches or even whole evangelical scenes to be pasted prominently on the walls. Marriages saw vytynanky in the shapes of doves, flowers, or the ones that formed “[[tree of life|trees of life]].”&lt;ref name=index2.php&gt;[http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20084/62 Vytynanka — an art of decorative paper cutting]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Women Environmental Artists Directory''' (WEAD) focuses on promoting environmental and [[Social justice]] art. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://weadartists.org/about-us | title=About Us | publisher=Women Environmental Artists Directory | accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; WEAD was founded in 1996 by Jo Hanson, Susan Leibovitz Steinman and Estelle Akamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://greenmuseum.org/generic_content.php?ct_id=285 | title=JO HANSON: Pioneering Environmental Artist Dies in San Francisco | publisher=Green Museum | accessdate=2013-08-12 | last=Leibovitz Steinman | first=Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

WEAD has been listed among the best projects relating to [[Environmental art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/md2z/greenarts/artprojects.html | title=Green Arts Web: Artists &amp; Projects | publisher=Carnegie Mellon University | accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has sponsored a number of exhibits about activist eco art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earthly Concerns, Activist EcoArt curated by WEAD|url=http://www.usfca.edu/uploadedFiles/Destinations/Library/thacher/archive/Earthly%20Concerns.pdf|publisher=University of San Francisco|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CONVERGENCE/DIVERGENCE SYMPOSIUM|url=http://www.losmedanos.edu/art/archive.aspx|publisher=Los Medanos College|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WEAD East I Women and the Environment|url=http://www.kbcc.cuny.edu/artgallery/Pages/ewead.aspx|publisher=Kingsborough Community College|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the co-founders, Ms. Steinman, is considered a leader in the eco art field and has participated in roundtables and artists in residences programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist Talk with Susan Steinman|url=http://goddard.edu/news-events/events/artist-talk-susan-steinman|publisher=Goddard College|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eco Art Video Salon|url=http://www.berkeleyartcenter.org/programs_Q4-2010.html|publisher=Berkeley Arts Center|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is listed in the sculptor directory of the International Sculpture Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sculptor Susan Leibovitz Steinman|url=http://www.sculpture.org/portfolio/sculptorPage.php?sculptor_id=1000451|publisher=International Sculpture Center|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another co-founder, Jo Hanson, was instrumental in founding an EPA Artist in Residence Program, which was aimed at educating the public about recycling. Another of the WEAD co-founders, Estelle Akamine, was also one of the artists in residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recology’s Artist in Residence|url=http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/smm/web-academy/2011/feb11.htm|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. Akamine's work has also been featured at the Museum of Craft and Folk Art museum store&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum Store|url=http://www.mocfa.org/store/artists.htm|publisher=Museum of Craft and Folk Art|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has lectured at a textile lecture series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Valoma|first=Deborah|title=Textiles Lecture Series Archive|url=https://www.cca.edu/news/2012/08/27/textiles-lecture-archive|publisher=California College for the Arts|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three co-founders were featured in a discussion about women artists of the American West whose art was about current social concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohn|first=Terri|title=Nature, Culture and Public Space|url=http://www.cla.purdue.edu/WAAW/Cohn/index.html|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The directory lists a wide variety of [[Woman artists]], such as [[Marina DeBris]], a [[trashion]] artist, [[Betty Beaumont]], often called a pioneer of environmental art, and Shai Zakai.

WEAD also published a magazine, which focuses on such topics as dirty water, and the legacy of atomic energy. A recent guest editor was Dr. Elizabeth Dougherty, founder of Wholly H2O, and speaker at events such as [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] conference on [[Water conservation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Water Conservation Showcase Speakers Save Water by Going Paperless!|url=http://www.pge.com/pec/water/presentations.shtml|publisher=Pacific Gas and Electric Company|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Toulumne County's conference on [[greywater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greywater in California:  Designing, Managing, Monitoring|url=http://portal.co.tuolumne.ca.us/psp/ps/TUP_HS_ENVIR_HEALTH/ENTP/c/TU_DEPT_MENU.TUOCM_HTML_COMP.GBL?action=U&amp;CONTENT_PNM=EMPLOYEE&amp;CATGID=2651|publisher=TUOLUMNE COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Weintraub was a contributor to a recent issue of the WEAD magazine.
