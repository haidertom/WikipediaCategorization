      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5655">'''‘Aql''' ({{lang-ar|عقل}}, meaning "intellect"), is an [[Arabic language]] term used in [[Islamic philosophy]] or [[Schools of Islamic theology|theology]] for the [[intellect]] or the [[reason|rational]] [[Faculties of the soul|faculty of the soul]] or mind. It is the normal translation of the Greek term ''[[nous]]''. In [[Islamic jurisprudence|jurisprudence]], it is associated with using reason as a source for ''[[sharia]]'' "religious law" and has been translated as "dialectical reasoning".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Esposito | first =John | author-link =John Esposito  | year =2004 | title =The Oxford Dictionary of Islam | series =Oxford paperback reference | publication-place =Oxford, UK | publisher =Oxford University Press | page =22 | isbn =0-19-512559-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DivineGuide"&gt;{{Citation | last =Moezzi | first =Mohammad Ali Amir | year =1994 | title =The Divine Guide in Early Shiʻism: The Sources of Esotericism in Islam | publication-place =Albany | publisher =State University of New York Press | page =6 | isbn =0-7914-2121-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alkafi"&gt;{{Citation |title = Kitab al-Kafi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alamut"&gt;{{Citation |first=Anthony |last=Campbell |title = The Assassins of Alamut| year = 2004 |pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In Islam, the term ‘aql was heavily elucidated by early Shī‘ah thinkers; it came to replace and expand the pre-Islamic concept of ''ḥilm'' ({{lang-ar|حلم}}) "serene justice and self-control, dignity" in opposition to the negative notions of ignorance (''jahl'') and stupidity (''safah'').&lt;ref name="DivineGuide" /&gt;

The "possessor of ‘aql", or ''al-‘āqīl'' (plural ''al-‘uqqāl'') realises a deep connection with God. [[Ja'far al-Sadiq|Jaʿfar aṣ-Ṣādiq]] (d. 765, notably an [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imām]]) described this connection as a realisation that God loves some, that God is truth and that only ''[[ilm (Arabic)|‘ilm]]'' "sacred knowledge" and its development can help humanity fulfil its potential.

His son, Imām [[Musa al-Kadhim|Mūsà al-Kāżim]] (d. 799), expanded this exegesis by defining ‘aql as the "faculty for apprehending the divine, a faculty of metaphysical perception, a light in the heart, through which one can discern and recognize signs from God."&lt;ref name="DivineGuide" /&gt; He further noted that where the A'immah (Imāms) are the ''ḥujjatu ż-żāhira'' "External proof [of God]", ‘aql is the ''ḥujjatu l-Bāṭina'' "Secret proof".&lt;ref name="DivineGuide" /&gt;

While in early Islam, ‘aql was opposed to ''jahl'' "ignorance", the expansion of the concept meant it was now opposed to ''safah'' "[deliberate] stupidity" and ''junūn'' "lack of sense, indulgence". Under the influence of [[Mu'tazili|Mu‘tazilī]] thought, ‘aql came to mean "dialectical reasoning".&lt;ref name="DivineGuide" /&gt;

== Shī‘ī Legal Implementation ==
In Shī‘ī jurisprudence, ‘aql is the process of using intellect or logic to deduce law. Legal scholars in both Sunni and Shī‘ī Islamic traditions share Quranic interpretation, the ''[[Sunnah]]'', and ''Ijma‘'' "consensus" as sources of Islamic law and judicial decisions (''ḥukm''). However, [[Twelver]]s of the Ja‘farī [[madh'hab|school of law]] utilize ‘aql whereas Sunnis use ''[[qiyas]]'' "analogical reasoning" as the fourth source of law.

Among Twelvers, [[Akhbari|Akhbārīs]] (associated with exotericism and traditionalism and theological schools in [[Qom]]) and [[Usuli]]s (associated with esotericism and rationalism and theological schools in [[Baghdad]]) were contending subschools: the former reject ''[[ijtihad|ijtihād]]'' outright; the latter advocate ''ijtihad'' and have been predominant for the last 300 years.&lt;ref name="DivineGuide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Masud | first =Muhammad Khalid | last2 =Messick | first2 =Binkley Morris | first3 =Powers | last3 =David Stephan | year =1996 | title =Islamic Legal Interpretation: Muftis and Their Fatwas  | series =Harvard studies in Islamic law | publication-place =Cambridge, MA | publisher =Harvard University Press | page =14 | isbn =0-674-46870-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shī‘ī Islam, "the gates of ''ijtihād''" were never closed and with the use of ‘aql, Shī‘ī ''mujtahid''s "practitioner of ''ijtihād''" and ''faqīh''s "legal specialists" are able to respond as issues arise that were not explicitly dealt with in the Qur'an or Sunnah.{{Islamic theology}}

&lt;/ref&gt; on affective haptics and real-time communication system with rich emotional and haptic channels. Driven by the motivation to enhance social interactivity and emotionally immersive experience of users of real-time messaging, virtual, augmented realities, the idea of reinforcing (intensifying) own feelings and reproducing (simulating) the emotions felt by the partner was proposed.
Four basic haptic (tactile) channels governing our emotions can be distinguished: (1) physiological changes (e.g., heart beat rate, body temperature, etc.), (2) physical stimulation (e.g., tickling), (3) social touch (e.g., hug, handshake), (4) emotional haptic design (e.g., shape of device, material, texture).

&lt;/ref&gt; the conscious experience of emotion occurs after the cortex receives signals about changes in physiological state. Researchers argued that feelings are preceded by certain physiological changes. Thus, when we see a venomous snake, we feel fear, because our cortex has received signals about our racing heart, knocking knees, etc. Damasio&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes primary and secondary emotions. Both involve changes in bodily states, but the secondary emotions are evoked by thoughts. Recent empirical studies support non-cognitive theories of nature of emotions. It was proven that we can easily evoke our emotions by something as simple as changing facial expression (e.g., smile brings on a feeling of happiness).&lt;ref&gt;

== Sense of touch in affective haptics ==

Human emotions can be easily evoked by different cues, and the sense of touch is one of the most emotionally charged channels. Affective haptic devices produce different senses of touch including kinesthetic and coetaneous channels. Kinesthetic stimulations, which are produced by forces exerted on the body, are sensed by mechanoreceptors in the tendons and muscles. On the other hand, mechanoreceptors in the skin layers are responsible for the perception of cutaneous stimulation. Different types of tactile corpuscles allow us sensing thermal property of the object, pressure, vibration frequency, and stimuli location.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; key feature is that it physically reproduces the human-hug pattern, generating pressure simultaneously on each user’s chest and back. The idea to realistically reproduce hugging is in integration of active-haptic device HaptiHug and pseudo-haptic touch simulated by hugging animation. Thus, high immersion into the physical contact of partners while hugging is achieved.

=== Intimate touch ===
Affection goes further than hugging alone. People in long distance relationships are faced with a lack of physical intimacy on a day-to-day basis. Haptic technology allows for kinesthetic and tactile interface design. The field of digital co-presence envelops Teledildonics as well. The Kiiroo SVir is a good example of an Adult CyberToy that incorporates tactile input, by means of a surface that is touch capacitive, and an inside that is kinesthetic in nature. 12 rings contract, pulse and vibrate according to the movements one's partner makes in real time. The SVir mimics the actual motion of its OPue counterpart and is also compatible with other SVir models.
The SVir enables women to have intercourse with their partner through use of the OPue interactive vibrator no matter how great the distance that separates the couple.

=== Implicit emotion elicitation ===
Different types of devices can be used to produce the physiological changes. Of the bodily organs, the heart plays a particularly important role in our emotional experience. The heart imitator HaptiHeart&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; produces special heartbeat patterns according to emotion to be conveyed or elicited (sadness is associated with slightly intense heartbeat, anger with quick and violent heartbeat, fear with intense heart rate). False heart beat feedback can be directly interpreted as a real heart beat, so it can change the emotional perception. HaptiButterfly&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; reproduces “butterflies in your stomach” (the fluttery or tickling feeling felt by people experiencing love) through arrays of vibration motors attached to the user’s abdomen. HaptiShiver&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; sends “shivers up and down your spine” through a row of vibration motors. HaptiTemper&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; sends “chills up and down your spine” through both cold airflow from a fan and the cold side of a Peltier element. HaptiTemper is also intended for simulation of warmth on the human skin to evoke either pleasant feeling or aggression

=== Explicit emotion elicitation ===
HaptiTickler&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; directly evokes joy by tickling the user’s ribs. It includes four vibration motors reproducing stimuli similar to human finger movements

=== Affective (emotional) haptic design. ===
Recent findings show that attractive things make people feel good, which in turn makes them think more creatively.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of emotional haptic design was proposed.&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; The core idea is to make user to feel an affinity for the device through:
* appealing shapes evoking the desire to touch and haptically explore them,
* material pleasurable to touch, and
* the anticipation of the pleasure of wearing the device.

=== Affective computing ===
[[Affective computing]] can be used to measure and to recognize emotional information in systems and devises employing affective haptics. Emotional information is extracted by using such techniques as speech recognition, natural language processing, facial expression detection, and measurement of physiological data.

== Potential applications ==
[[Image:iFeelIM.png|thumb|400px | The iFeel_IM! architecture]]
Possible applications are as follows:
* treating depression and anxiety (problematic emotional states),
* controlling and modulating moods on the basis of physiological signals,
* affective and collaborative games,
* psychological testing,
* assistive technology and augmentative communication systems for children with autism.
Affective Haptics is in the vanguard of emotional telepresence,&lt;ref&gt;

The philosophy behind the iFeel_IM! (intelligent system for Feeling enhancement powered by affect sensitive Instant Messenger) is “I feel [therefore] I am!”. In the iFeel_IM! system, great importance is placed on the automatic sensing of emotions conveyed through textual messages in 3D virtual world Second Life (artificial intelligence), the visualization of the detected emotions by avatars in virtual environment, enhancement of user’s affective state, and reproduction of feeling of social touch (e.g., hug) by means of haptic stimulation in a real world. The control of the conversation is implemented through the Second Life object called EmoHeart&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; developed two tactile systems (i.e. mobile phone based and chair based) which could render human facial expression for visually impaired persons. These systems conveyed human emotions to visually impaired persons using vibrotactile stimuli.

To produce movie-specific tactile stimuli influencing the viewer’s emotions to the viewer’s body, the wearable tactile jacket was developed by Philips researchers.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Art''' is a diverse range of [[human behavior|human activities]] in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts ([[artworks]]), expressing the author's [[imagination|imaginative]], [[Concept|conceptual]] [[idea]], or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/art |title=Art: definition |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/art |title=art |publisher=Merriam-Websters Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. 

The three classical branches of art are [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=q8rvdsxGokwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Vasari+lives+of+painters,+sculptors+and+painters&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTta2zrLreAhUGbBoKHdSoDUIQ6AEIKDAA]&lt;/ref&gt; Music, theatre, film, dance, and other [[performing arts]], as well as literature and other media such as [[interactive media]], are included in a broader definition  of [[the arts]].&lt;ref name=OD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Art, n. 1". OED Online. December 2011. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com. (Accessed 26 February 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 17th century, ''art'' referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from [[craft]]s or [[sciences]]. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or [[applied arts]].

Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Definitions of Art |author=Stephen Davies |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8014-9794-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Artworks: Definition, Meaning, Value |author=Robert Stecker |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-271-01596-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theories of Art Today |editor=Noël Carroll |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-299-16354-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from [[Agency (philosophy)|human agency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ubc.ca/okanagan/creative/links/arthistory/What_is_Art_.html |archive-date=27 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427192624/http://www.ubc.ca/okanagan/creative/links/arthistory/What_is_Art_.html |title=What Is Art? |author=Dr. Robert J.

==Creative art and fine art==
{{wide image|Wang Ximeng - A Thousand Li of River (Bridge).jpg|1250px|Works of art can tell stories or simply express an aesthetic truth or feeling. Panorama of a section of ''A Thousand Li of Mountains and Rivers'', a 12th-century painting by Song dynasty artist [[Wang Ximeng]].}}

In the perspective of the history of art,&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early [[pre-historic art]] to [[contemporary art]]; however, some theories restrict the concept of "artistic works" to modern Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James "Art History and Images That Are Not Art", ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 47, No. 4 (December 1995), with previous bibliography. "Non-Western images are not well described in terms of art, and neither are medieval paintings that were made in the absence of humanist ideas of artistic value". 553&lt;/ref&gt; One early sense of the definition of ''art'' is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft," as associated with words such as "artisan." English words derived from this meaning include ''artifact'', ''artificial'', ''artifice'', ''medical arts'', and ''military arts''. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its [[etymology]].
[[File:Teke bottle.JPG|thumb|upright|20th-century Rwandan bottle. Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their decorative value.]]

Over time, [[Philosopher|philosophers]] like [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Socrates]] and [[Kant]], among others, questioned the meaning of art.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 73-96&lt;/ref&gt; Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the [[muses]], and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]] ''(265a–c), and yet in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]'' wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the ''Republic''. The dialogue ''Ion'' suggests that [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 40-72&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|mimetic]] or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, and more recent, sense of the word ''art'' as an abbreviation for ''creative art'' or ''fine art'' emerged in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''. [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;120&lt;/ref&gt; Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or ''finer'' work of art.

Within this latter sense, the word ''art'' may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (''art'' as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce ''artworks'' (''art'' as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience).  Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as [[Kant]], the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 287-326&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered [[commercial art]] instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered [[applied art]]. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.&lt;ref&gt;David Novitz, ''The Boundaries of Art'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see [[aesthetics]]); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong [[emotion]]s. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.

The nature of art has been described by philosopher [[Richard Wollheim]] as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wollheim, ''Art and its objects'', p. 1, 2nd ed., 1980, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-29706-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating [[Formalism (art)|formal elements]] for their own sake, and as ''[[mimesis]]'' or [[Representation (arts)|representation]]. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Levinson5/&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]] identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.&lt;ref name="Levinson5"&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 5. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[R.G. Collingwood]] advanced the [[Idealism|idealist]] view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 16. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Collingwood's view, expressed in ''The Principles of Art'', is considered in Wollheim, op. cit. 1980 pp. 36–43&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of [[Kant]], and was developed in the early twentieth century by [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].  More recently, thinkers influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]] have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Heidegger]], "The Origin of the Work of Art", in ''Poetry, Language, Thought'', (Harper Perennial, 2001). See also [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], "Cézanne's Doubt" in ''The Merleau-Ponty Aesthetics Reader'', Galen Johnson and Michael Smith (eds), (Northwestern University Press, 1994) and [[John Russon]], ''Bearing Witness to Epiphany'', (State University of New York Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] has offered an [[institutional theory of art]] that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as "the [[art world]]" has conferred "the status of candidate for appreciation".&lt;ref&gt;Kennick, William ed, and W. E. Kennick, ''Art and philosophy: readings in aesthetics'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979, p. 89. {{ISBN|0-312-05391-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Shiner has described fine art as "not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old."&lt;ref&gt;Shiner 2003. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]''Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 3. {{ISBN|978-0-226-75342-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art may be characterized in terms of [[mimesis]] (its representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gombrich, Ernst. |url=http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |title=Press statement on The Story of Art |accessdate=18 November 2008 |year=2005 |website=The Gombrich Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006212330/http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |archivedate=6 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[History of Iran|Persia]], India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Olmec]]. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.83, pp.75-115 pp.132-141, pp.147-155, p.163, p.627.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Medieval art]] of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about Biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.86-89, pp.135-141, p.143, p.179, p.185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance art]] had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of [[graphical perspective]] to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.&lt;ref name="Nichols2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Nichols|title=Renaissance Art: A Beginner's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzMRpHo0QHUC|date=1 December 2012|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-178-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tugra Mahmuds II.gif|right|thumb|The stylized signature of [[Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] was written in [[Islamic calligraphy]]. It reads "Mahmud Khan son of Abdulhamid is forever victorious".]]
[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan Panorama - Grande Mosquée de Kairouan Panorama.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in Tunisia, also called the Mosque of Uqba, is one of the finest, most significant and best preserved artistic and architectural examples of early great mosques.

Taylor &amp; Francis. 1983. p. 104]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the east, [[Islamic art]]'s rejection of [[iconography]] led to emphasis on [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]], [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt; Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning [[terracotta army]] of Emperor Qin&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 634-635&lt;/ref&gt;), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, [[Tang dynasty]] paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but [[Ming dynasty]] paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition.&lt;ref name="Watson1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Watson|title=The Arts of China 900-1620|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-v5jUKaCxYC|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09835-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. [[Woodblock printing]] became important in Japan after the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.155, p.530.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ma Lin Guests.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by [[Song dynasty]] artist Ma Lin, ''circa'' 1250. 24.8&amp;nbsp;× 25.2&amp;nbsp;cm]]

The western [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as [[William Blake|Blake]]'s portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer,&lt;ref name="Moore2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Moore|title=Propaganda Prints: A History of Art in the Service of Social and Political Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0KAlsQ2Yj4C|date=6 August 2010|publisher=A&amp;amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-0591-7|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Jacques-Louis David|David]]'s propagandistic paintings. This led to [[Romanticism|Romantic]] rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of [[Goethe]]. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as [[academic art]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[impressionism]] and [[fauvism]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.394-395, pp.519-527, pp. 573-575.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Age of Enlightenment An Anthology Prepared for the Enlightenment Book Club|url=http://www.rosenfels.org/The_Age_Of_Enlightenment_Anthology.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2018|pages=1–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of twentieth-century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of [[impressionism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, [[African art|African sculptures]] were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by [[Matisse]]. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like [[Communism]] and [[Post-Modernism]] exerting a powerful influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New York Times Book Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwEjAQAAMAAJ|volume=1, 84|year=1979|publisher=New York Times Company|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism]], the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. [[Theodor W. Adorno]] said in 1970, "It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist."&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W., ''Aesthetic Theory'', (1970 in German)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relativism]] was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of [[contemporary art]] and [[List of postmodern critics|postmodern criticism]], where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with [[skepticism]] and irony. Furthermore, the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than of regional ones.&lt;ref name="Sangeeta2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Sangeeta|title=Development of Modern Art Criticism in India after Independence: Post Independence Indian Art Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqs4DwAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=6 October 2017|publisher=Notion Press|isbn=978-1-947697-31-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]'', [[Martin Heidegger]], a German philosopher and a seminal thinker, describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth. He argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture, but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which "that which is" can be revealed. Works of art are not merely representations of the way things are, but actually produce a community's shared understanding. Each time a new artwork is added to any culture, the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed.

==Forms, genres, media, and styles==

{{Main|The arts}}
The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as [[List of art mediums|media]], genre, [[Art movement|styles]], and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walton |first1=Kendall L. |title=Categories of Art |journal=The Philosophical Review |date=1 January 1970 |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=334–67 |doi=10.2307/2183933 |jstor=2183933}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Art form''''' refers to the [[elements of art]] that are independent of its interpretation or significance. It covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the artwork, primarily non-semantic aspects of the work (i.e., [[figurae]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Monelle |first1=Raymond |title=Linguistics and Semiotics in Music |date=3 January 1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-3718652099 |page=202 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMtQAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;pg=PA202#q=figurae |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Color theory|color]], [[Contour drawing|contour]], [[Fourth dimension in art|dimension]], [[List of art mediums|medium]], [[melody]], [[Negative space|space]], [[Texture (painting)|texture]], and [[Lightness|value]]. Form may also include [[Visual design elements and principles#Principles of design|visual design principles]], such as arrangement, [[Formal balance|balance]], [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], [[harmony]], [[Hierarchical proportion|proportion]], [[Principles of grouping|proximity]], and rhythm.&lt;ref name="Belton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Belton |first1=Dr. Robert J. |title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook |chapter=The Elements of Art |date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art, focusing respectively on form, content, and context.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Extreme [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal (that is, part of the art form). Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=Min |last2=Deng |first2=Guifang |title=Against Zangwill's Extreme Formalism About Inorganic Nature |journal=Philosophia |date=2 December 2014 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=249–57 |doi=10.1007/s11406-014-9575-1 |url=http://xy.cmsproxy.sysu.edu.cn/pub/hkmacc/docs/2014-12/20141215194213014875.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors refer to subject matter and content – i.e., [[denotation]]s and [[connotation]]s – while others prefer terms like [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and [[Importance|significance]].&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Extreme Intentionalism holds that [[authorial intent]] plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded.&lt;ref name="Livingston"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Livingston |first1=Paisley |title=Intentionalism in Aesthetics |journal=New Literary History |date=1998 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=831–46 |doi=10.1353/nlh.1998.0042 |url=http://works.bepress.com/paisley_livingston/67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Munk |first1=Eduard |last2=Beck |first2=Charles |last3=Felton |first3=Cornelius Conway |title=The Metres of the Greeks and Romans |date=1844 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxRgAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the content as the artist's experience of that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tolstoy |first1=Leo |title=What is Art? |date=1899 |publisher=Crowell |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA24 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the composition of [[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]] is partly borrowed from the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]]. As evidenced by the title, the subject is [[Napoleon]], and the content is [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s representation of Napoleon as "Emperor-God beyond time and space".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is "socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Finally, the developing theory of [[post-structuralism]] studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Melahat Küçükarslan |last1=Emiroğlu |first2=Fitnat Cimşit |last2=Koş |title=Design Semiotics and Post-Structuralism |conference=12th World Congress of Semiotics |date=16–20 September 2014 |location=New Bulgarian University |url=http://semio2014.org/en/design-semiotics-and-post-structuralism |access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. [[Art criticism]] continues to grow and develop alongside art.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a [[Media (arts)|medium]]. Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a [[language]] to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.&lt;ref&gt;Breskin, Vladimir, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110901145415/http://vip.iva.dk/signs/Articles_Signs_International_Section/2010/Breskin_(2010)_Signs_Triad_eng_final_rev_2010.pdf "Triad: Method for studying the core of the semiotic parity of language and art"], ''Signs – International Journal of Semiotics'' 3, pp. 1–28, 2010. {{ISSN|1902-8822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.
A common view is that the [[Wikt:epithet|epithet]] "art", particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for [[Leonardo da Vinci]], art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated London News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oc-AQAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=July 1872|publisher=Illustrated London News &amp; Sketch Limited|page=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rembrandt]]'s work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity.&lt;ref name="NewtonNeil1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Newton|author2=William Neil|title=2000 Years of Christian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsSfAAAAMAAJ|year=1966|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of [[John Singer Sargent]] were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency,&lt;ref name="RichardsGjertson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kirk Richards|author2=Stephen Gjertson|title=For glory and for beauty: practical perspectives on Christianity and the visual arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaBGAQAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=American Society of Classical Realism|isbn=978-0-9636180-4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, [[Pablo Picasso]], was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.&lt;ref name="Leslie2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Leslie|title=Pablo Picasso: A Modern Master|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iE8Es-9j3e0C|date=30 December 2005|publisher=New Line Books|isbn=978-1-59764-094-7|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DillenbergerHandley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jane Dillenberger|author2=John Handley|title=The Religious Art of Pablo Picasso|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uglDQAAQBAJ|date=17 April 2014|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27629-1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common contemporary criticism of some [[modern art]] occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s "[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]" is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ("ready-made") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred S. Kleiner|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UK_jTggtYl8C|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=7 January 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57364-7|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tracey Emin]]'s ''My Bed'', or [[Damien Hirst]]'s ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'' follow this example and also manipulate the mass media. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Luke|title=Damien Hirst's Shark: Nature, Capitalism and the Sublime|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/the-sublime/luke-white-damien-hirsts-shark-nature-capitalism-and-the-sublime-r1136828|publisher=Tate|accessdate=26 May 2018|language=en|date=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects. However, there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating ''hands-on'' works of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Belle Assemblée|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pucAAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|volume=V|year=1808|publisher=J.

Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is "vague", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Lévi-Strauss).&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Schiuma|title=The Value of Arts for Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wyboE8aWDcC|date=19 May 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49665-0|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-motivated functions ===
The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;
# '''[[fine arts|Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm]].''' Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.&lt;blockquote&gt;Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry. - Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=Republic |chapter=[Book 10:] The Poetics |others=Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient Greeks often speak of the arts collectively |url=http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html |website=www.authorama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Experience of the mysterious.''' Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.&lt;blockquote&gt;The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. – Albert Einstein&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. "The World as I See It". http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Expression of the imagination.''' Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.&lt;blockquote&gt;Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else—something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken. - Immanuel Kant&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Aesthetic Judgement'' (1790).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Ritualistic and symbolic functions.''' In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.&lt;blockquote&gt;Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'. - Silva Tomaskova&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Tomaskova, ''Places of Art: Art and Archaeology in Context'': (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Motivated functions ===
Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephanidis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Constantine Stephanidis|title=HCI International 2011 Posters' Extended Abstracts: International Conference, HCI International 2011, Orlando, FL, USA, July 9-14, 2011,Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qble3WYcH0cC|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-22094-4|pages=529–533}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Communication.''' Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.&lt;blockquote&gt;[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication. – Steve Mithen&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mithen. ''The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science''. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as entertainment'''. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.&lt;ref name="Resources2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Management Association, Information Resources|title=Digital Arts and Entertainment: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BaXBQAAQBAJ|date=30 June 2014|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-6115-8|page=976}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''The Avante-Garde. Art for political change.''' One of the defining functions of early twentieth-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal—[[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Russian constructivism]], and [[Abstract Expressionism]], among others—are collectively referred to as the ''avante-garde'' arts.&lt;blockquote&gt;By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. – André Breton (Surrealism)&lt;ref&gt;André Breton, ''Surrealist Manifesto'' (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as a "free zone"''', removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the [[avant-garde]] movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, [[contemporary art]] has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction ...), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Maurizio Bolognini]] this is not only associated with the [[postmodern art|postmodern]] rejection of all canons but with a process of secularization of art, which is finally considered as "a mere (albeit essential) convention, sustained and reproduced by the art system (artists, galleries, critics, collectors), providing a free zone, that is, a more open place for experimentation, removed from the constraints of the practical sphere.": see {{Cite book |title=Postdigitale |url=http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm |year=2008 |author=Maurizio Bolognini |publisher=Carocci |location=Rome |isbn=978-88-430-4739-0}}, [http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm#ch3b chap. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy.''' While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.[[File:Graffiti Panorama rome.jpg|upright=3.2|thumb|center|[[Aerosol paint|Spray-paint]] [[graffiti]] on a wall in Rome]] [[Graffiti#Uses|Graffiti art]] and other types of [[street art]] are graphics and images that are [[Spray painting|spray-painted]] or [[stencil]]led on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).

# '''Art for psychological and healing purposes.''' Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as [[art therapy]]. The [[Art therapy#The Diagnostic Drawing Series (DDS)|Diagnostic Drawing Series]], for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.&lt;ref name="Hogan2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Hogan|title=Healing Arts: The History of Art Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzUuna6LPBIC|year=2001|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-85302-799-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for propaganda, or commercialism.''' Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Barthes]], ''Mythologies''&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art as a fitness indicator.''' It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the [[peacock]]'s tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also [[Fisherian runaway]] and [[handicap principle]]). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton|Dutton, Denis]]. 2003. "Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology" in ''The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.

==Public access==
[[File:Chateau-de-versailles-cour.jpg|upright=2|thumb|left|Versailles: [[Louis Le Vau]] opened up the interior court to create the expansive entrance ''[[cour d'honneur]]'', later copied all over Europe.]]

Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 161-165&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the [[ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas]] are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a [[social elite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceramics of the Indigenous Peoples of South America: Studies of Production and Exchange using INAA|url=https://core.tdar.org/collection/58128/ceramics-of-the-indigenous-peoples-of-south-america-studies-of-production-and-exchange-using-inaa|website=core.tdar.org|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other forms of art may have been. Reproductive methods such as [[Molding (process)|moulds]] made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality [[Ancient Roman pottery]] and Greek [[Tanagra figurine]]s to a very wide market. [[Cylinder seal]]s were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref name="Kipfer2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Ann Kipfer|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XneTstDbcC0C|date=30 April 2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-306-46158-3|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[coin]]s were widely used, these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Coins as Works of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34jbjgEACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1960|publisher=Museum Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when [[printmaking]] began with small [[woodcut]]s, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-colored, and affordable even by [[peasant]]s who glued them to the walls of their homes. Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations.&lt;ref name="Tucker2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Hugo Tucker|title=Forms of the "medieval" in the "Renaissance": A Multidisciplinary Exploration of a Cultural Continuum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zfbNzcqgYM4C|year=2000|publisher=Rookwood Press|isbn=978-1-886365-20-9|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popular prints]] of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries.&lt;ref name="Griffiths1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antony Griffiths|title=Prints and Printmaking: An Introduction to the History and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbxFOR8ujlYC|year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20714-1|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public art|Public buildings and monuments]], secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design. [[Egyptian temple]]s are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests.&lt;ref name="Vörös2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Győző Vörös|title=Egyptian Temple Architecture: 100 Years of Hungarian Excavations in Egypt, 1907-2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StEyE9jkMHEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2007|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=978-963-662-084-4|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the [[Palace of Versailles]], where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.&lt;ref name="Waldie1839"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Waldie|title=The Select Circulating Library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBs7AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1839|publisher=A. Waldie.|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the [[Orleans Collection#Collection in Paris|Orleans Collection]] mostly housed in a wing of the [[Palais Royal]] in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="MeyerSavoy2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrea Meyer|author2=Benedicte Savoy|title=The Museum Is Open: Towards a Transnational History of Museums 1750-1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhroBQAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=1 January 2014|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-029882-6|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the art tourism of the [[Grand Tour]] became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The British [[Royal Collection]] remains distinct, but large donations such as the [[Old Royal Library]] were made from it to the [[British Museum]], established in 1753. The [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]] opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before.&lt;ref name="Fossi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gloria Fossi|title=The Uffizi: The Official Guide : All of the Works|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYUh_6F-hc8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1999|publisher=Giunti Editore|isbn=978-88-09-01487-9|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building now occupied by the [[Prado]] in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in [[Vienna]], Munich and other capitals. The opening of the [[Musée du Louvre]] during the [[French Revolution]] (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Access to Art in Paris: A Documentary History from the Middle Ages to 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpD9NgeQozEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04434-7|pages=281–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses. ([[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, for example, was created by [[John Taylor Johnston]], a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.&lt;ref name="Findlay2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Findlay|title=The Value of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6jJ5FvdLjcC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2012|publisher=Prestel Verlag|isbn=978-3-641-08342-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|Performance by [[Joseph Beuys]], 1978: ''Everyone an artist – On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism'']]

There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is "necessary to present something more than mere objects"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An Interview with Joseph Beuys |journal=ArtForum |date=December 1969 |first=Willoughby |last=Sharp |volume=8 |issue=4 |page=45 |id= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as [[performance art]], [[video art]], and [[conceptual art]]. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. "Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art ... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form ... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object."&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, Anne: ''New Art in the 60s and 70s Redefining Reality'', p. 35. Thames and Hudson, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mia |last=Fineman |title=YouTube for Artists The best places to find video art online. |date=21 March 2007 |publisher= |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2162382/ |work=Slate |pages= |accessdate=3 August 2007 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. "With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: ''Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980'', p. 16. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:JEAN LOUIS THÉODORE GÉRICAULT - La Balsa de la Medusa (Museo del Louvre, 1818-19).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|[[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'', ''circa'' 1820]]

Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view. [[Iconoclasm]] is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. [[Aniconism]] is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of [[Islamic art]], where [[depictions of Muhammad]] remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by [[art critic]]s, though often much less so by a wider public. The [[iconography|iconographic]] content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the [[Swoon of the Virgin]] in scenes of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]. [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The ''Last Judgment'']] by [[Michelangelo]] was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of [[decorum]] through nudity and the [[Apollo]]-like pose of Christ.&lt;ref name="McCue2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maureen McCue|title=British Romanticism and the Reception of Italian Old Master Art, 1793-1840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xW43DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-17148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickerson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela K.

The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of [[Romanticism]], and economic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance. Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'' (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[The Luncheon on the Grass|Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe]]'' (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the [[nude]] woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world.&lt;ref name="RuprechtTaiana1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvina Ruprecht|author2=Cecilia Taiana|title=Reordering of Culture: Latin America, the Caribbean and Canada in the Hood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onoI0AI-JJYC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 November 1995|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-88629-269-0|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stout2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=John C.

The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937) used arresting [[cubism|cubist]] techniques and stark [[Monochrome painting|monochromatic oils]], to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. [[Leon Golub]]'s ''Interrogation III'' (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. [[Andres Serrano]]'s ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.&lt;ref name="ChapmanCiment2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Chapman|author2=James Ciment|title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints and Voices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XO9nBwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=17 March 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47351-0|page=594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Arthur Brown|title=Noah's Other Son: Bridging the Gap Between the Bible and the Qur'an|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JjbUAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 October 2008|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-2996-4|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
{{Main|Aesthetics}}
Before Modernism, aesthetics in Western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of [[Realism (arts)|realism or truth to nature]] and the [[Idealism|ideal]]; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries.  This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art.  The aesthetic theorist [[John Ruskin]], who championed what he saw as the naturalism of [[J. M. W. Turner|J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Turner]], saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;"go to nature in all [[singleness of heart]], rejecting nothing and selecting nothing, and scorning nothing, believing all things are right and good, and rejoicing always in the truth". [[John Ruskin|Ruskin, John]]. ''[[Modern Painters]]'', Volume I, 1843. London: Smith, Elder and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. [[Richard Wollheim]] distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the [[Aesthetic realism|Realist]], whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivist]], whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the [[Relativist]] [[Aesthetic relativism|position]], whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim 1980, ''Essay VI''. pp. 231–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of Modernism===
[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1930 - Mondrian Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow.jpg|thumb|''Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow'' (1930) by [[Piet Mondrian]] (Dutch, 1872–1944)]]
The arrival of [[Modernism]] in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art,&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Differencing the Canon''. Routledge, London &amp; New York, 1999. {{ISBN|0-415-06700-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]]. [[Clement Greenberg]]'s 1960 article "Modernist Painting" defines modern art as "the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself".&lt;ref name = "Frascina"&gt;''Modern Art and Modernism: A Critical Anthology''. ed. Francis Frascina and Charles Harrison, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:
{{quote|Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting—the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment—were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly.&lt;ref name = "Frascina" /&gt;}} After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as [[Michael Fried]], [[T.

[[Pop art]]ists like [[Andy Warhol]] became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the [[art world]]. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond ''high art'' to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.&lt;ref name="Gemünden1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerd Gemünden|title=Framed Visions: Popular Culture, Americanization, and the Contemporary German and Austrian Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mpfn_pue34C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1998|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-08560-6|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Yorker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BcnAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2004|publisher=F-R Publishing Corporation|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind- everything. However, the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction.&lt;ref name="Duchamp Interview Clip"&gt;{{YouTube|haon2DXWvLk|Duchamp Two Statements}}{{Dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i.e. Fine Art. Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity i.e. Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but [[techne]]. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and [[craft]] are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included painting, sculpting and music but also; cooking, medicine, [[horsemanship]], [[geometry]], [[carpentry]], [[prophecy]], and farming etc.&lt;ref name="BurgueteLam2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maria Burguete|author2=Lui Lam|title=Arts: A Science Matter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zKmND2ImrGUC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4324-93-9|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Criticism and the "intentional fallacy"===
Following Duchamp during the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.&lt;ref name="Waugh2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia Waugh|title=Literary Theory and Criticism: An Oxford Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LXMA_7Ko9YC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929133-5|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colebrook1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire Colebrook|title=New Literary Histories: New Historicism and Contemporary Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aT-8AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1997|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4987-3|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.&lt;ref name="Roholt2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tiger C. Roholt|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=US6aAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=10 October 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-3246-8|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hick2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Darren Hudson Hick|title=Introducing Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_S4DgAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=24 August 2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-350-00691-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B. , et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms's assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."&lt;ref&gt;Gaut and Livingston, ''The Creation of Art'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"&gt;Gaut and Livingston, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"/&gt;

==="Linguistic turn" and its debate===
The end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the "innocent eye debate", and generally referred to as the structuralism-[[poststructuralism]] debate in the philosophy of art. This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy for Architecture'', Branco Mitrovic, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the ensuing movement of [[poststructuralism]]. In 1981, the artist [[Mark Tansey]] created a work of art titled "The Innocent Eye" as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century. Influential theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]]. The fact that language is ''not'' a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of [[philosophy of language]] which originated in the works of [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Structuralism'', Michael Lane, Basic Books University of Michigan, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[Nelson Goodman]] in his book ''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]'' came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960–61 [[John Locke lectures]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was challenged on the basis of research done by the Nobel prize winning psychologist [[Roger Sperry]] who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone (the linguistic turn) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable. Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as Nick Zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, "Feasible Aesthetic Formalism", ''Nous'', December 1999, pp. 610–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification disputes==
{{Main|Classificatory disputes about art}}
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|The original ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], 1917, photographed by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at the [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession|291]] after the 1917 [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit. Stieglitz used a backdrop of ''The Warriors'' by [[Marsden Hartley]] to photograph the urinal. The exhibition entry tag can be clearly seen.&lt;ref name="Tomkins, p. 186"&gt;Tomkins, ''Duchamp: A Biography'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;]] Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art. Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included [[cubist]] and [[impressionist]] paintings, [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', the movies, superlative imitations of [[J. S. G. Boggs|banknotes]], [[conceptual art]], and [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Deborah Solomon |title=2003: the 3rd Annual Year in Ideas: Video Game Art |newspaper=The New York Times Magazine |date=14 December 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-video-game-art.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, "the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life" are "so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art" (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' criticized [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]'s and [[Tracey Emin|Emin]]'s work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Colin. ''Contemporary Art and the Home''. Berg Publishers, 2002. p. 12. {{ISBN|1-85973-661-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Arthur Danto]], suggested a thought experiment showing that "the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood."&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Denis [http://www.denisdutton.com/tribal_art.htm "Tribal Art"] in ''[[Encyclopedia of Aesthetics]], edited by Michael Kelly (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998).''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur.

Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the [[decorative arts]], or advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Glancey |first1=Jonathan |title=Is advertising art? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/is-advertising-art-1593252.html |accessdate=23 June 2018 |work=The Independent |date=26 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value judgment===
[[File:Aboriginal hollow log tomb.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Aboriginal hollow log tombs. National Gallery, [[Canberra]], Australia]]

Somewhat in relation to the above, the word ''art'' is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as "that meal was a work of art" (the cook is an artist),&lt;ref name="Potts2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joe Potts|title=The Kahuna Kit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uu6lPR6EPQC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=8 August 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-8689-2|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art of deception", (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity. Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered ''art'' is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, "good" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3rd&amp;nbsp;of May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.&lt;ref name="AddisonBurgess2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Addison|author2=Lesley Burgess|title=Debates in Art and Design Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOY10gcBeP8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=28 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-61887-8|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FergusonMansbach2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yale H.

The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the ''[[zeitgeist]]''. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse [[aesthetic]] or [[morality|moral]] feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the [[human condition]]; that is, what it is to be human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Gordon |title=Philosophy of the arts: an introduction to aesthetics |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Validated biomarkers of aging would allow for testing interventions to [[life extension|extend lifespan]], because changes in the biomarkers would be observable throughout the lifespan of the organism.&lt;ref name="BakerGT" /&gt;  Although [[maximum lifespan]] would be a means of validating biomarkers of aging, it would not be a practical means for long-lived species such as humans because [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] would take far too much time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Harrison, Ph.D. | first = David E. | title = V.

Although [[Human hair color#Gray and white hair|graying of hair]] increases with age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Van Neste D, Tobin DJ | title=Hair cycle and hair pigmentation: dynamic interactions and changes associated with aging | journal=MICRON | volume=35 | issue=3 | year=2004 | pages=193–200 | id= | pmid=15036274 | doi=10.1016/j.micron.2003.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; hair graying cannot be called a biomarker of ageing. Similarly, [[wrinkle|skin wrinkles]] and other common changes seen with aging are not better indicators of future functionality than chronological age. [[Gerontology#Biogerontology|Biogerontologists]] have continued efforts to find and validate biomarkers of aging, but success thus far has been limited. Levels of CD4 and CD8 [[memory T cell]]s and [[naive T cell]]s have been used to give good predictions of the expected lifespan of middle-aged mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Miller RA | title=Biomarkers of aging: prediction of longevity by using age-sensitive T-cell subset determinations in a middle-aged, genetically heterogeneous mouse population| journal=Journals of Gerontology | volume=56 | issue=4 | year=2001 | pages=B180–B186 | id= | pmid=11283189 | doi=10.1093/gerona/56.4.b180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in [[big data]] analysis allowed for the new types of "aging clocks" to be developed. The [[epigenetic clock]] is a promising biomarker of aging and can accurately predict human chronological age.&lt;ref name="pmid24138928"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Horvath S | title=DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types | journal=[[Genome Biology]]  | volume=14 | issue=10 | year=2013 | pages=R115  | url = http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/r115  | pmc = 4015143 |pmid=24138928 | doi=10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic blood biochemistry and cell counts can also be used to accurately predict the chronological age.&lt;ref name="pmid27191382"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Zhavoronkov A |title=Deep biomarkers of human aging: Application of deep neural networks to biomarker development |journal= Aging |volume=8 |issue=5 |year=2016 |pages= 1021–33 |url=http://www.aging-us.com/article/SzdNR3HCatAdyvwPR/text |pmc= 4931851 |pmid= 27191382 |doi= 10.18632/aging.100968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies of the [[hematological clock]] on the large datasets from South Korean, Canadian, and Eastern European populations demonstrated that biomarkers of aging may be population-specific and predictive of mortality.&lt;ref name= "pmid29340580"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Population Specific Biomarkers of Human Aging: A Big Data Study Using South Korean, Canadian, and Eastern European Patient Populations |journal= The Journals of Gerontology: Series A |volume= 6 |issue= 11 |pages= 1482–1490 |year=2018 |author= Polina Mamoshina, Kirill Kochetov, Evgeny Putin, Franco Cortese, Alexander Aliper, Won-Suk Lee, Sung-Min Ahn, Lee Uhn, Neil Skjodt, Olga Kovalchuk, Morten Scheibye-Knudsen, Alex Zhavoronkov |url= http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9570 |doi= 10.1093/gerona/gly005 |pmid= 29340580 |pmc= 6175034 |via= (text: [https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/gerona/gly005/4801287#111582158 link])}} &lt;/ref&gt;
It is also possible to predict the human chronological age using the [[transcriptomic clock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The transcriptional landscape of age in human peripheral blood |journal=Nature Communications |volume=6 |pages=8570 |year=2015 |author= Peters M |url= http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9570 |doi=10.1038/ncomms9570 |pmid=26490707 |pmc=4639797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A broader acceptance of biomarkers of aging, however, will depend on a better understanding of the observed correlations to the incidence of specific diseases, improved transferability of the models across populations and reduction of costs of the studies. The recent introduction of low-power and compact sensors, based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) has led to a new breed of the wearable and affordable devices providing unparalleled opportunities for the collecting and cloud-storing personal digitized activity records. 
Consequently, modern [[deep learning]] techniques could be used to produce a proof-of-concept digital biomarker of age in the form of all-causes-mortality predictor from a sufficiently  large collection of one week long human physical activity streams augmented by the rich clinical data (including the death register, as provided by, e.g., the [[NHANES]] study).&lt;ref name="pmid 29581467"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tim Pyrkov, Konstantin Slipensky, Mikhail Barg, Alexey Kondrashin, Boris Zhurov, Alexander Zenin, Mikhail Pyatnitskiy, Leonid Menshikov, Sergei Markov, and Peter O.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="655">'''Callaïs''' is the name of a green stone used for making beads by western European [[archaeological culture|cultures]] of the later [[Neolithic]] and Early [[Bronze Age]]. It was described by [[Pliny the Elder]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/37*.html#56 (NH&amp;nbsp;XXXVII.lvi.151)] as being paler than [[lapis lazuli]].

Its source was probably [[Brittany]], near Locmariaquer where numerous [[turquoise]] items have been found, although this has not been confirmed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21513">In [[literary criticism]], '''close reading''' is the careful, sustained interpretation of a brief passage of a text.  A close reading emphasizes the single and the particular over the general, effected by close [[attention]] to individual words, the syntax, the order in which the sentences unfold ideas, as well as formal structures. A truly attentive close reading of a two-hundred-word poem might be thousands of words long without exhausting the possibilities for observation and insight.

== History ==
Literary close reading and commentaries have extensive precedent in the [[exegesis]] of religious texts, and more broadly, [[hermeneutics]] of ancient works. For example, [[Pazand]], a genre of [[middle Persian]] literature, refers to the ''Zend'' (literally: 'commentary'/'translation') texts that offer explanation and close reading of the [[Avesta]], the sacred texts of [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Avesta|last=Williams Jackson|first=A.V.|work=A Library of the World's Best Literature, Ancient and Modern,|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-1-60520-191-7|editor-last=Warner|editor-first=Charles Dudley|volume=III|location=New York|pages=1084, 1086|orig-year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scriptural commentaries of the [[Talmud]] offer a commonly cited early predecessor to close reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25832229|title=Hermeneutics, ancient and modern|last=L.|first=Bruns, Gerald|date=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300054505|location=New Haven|oclc=25832229}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Islamic studies, the close reading of the [[Quran]] has flourished and produced an immense corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/browse/encyclopaedia-of-the-quran|title=Exegesis of the Qur'an: Early Modern and Contemporary|last=Wielandt|first=Rotraud|date=|editor-last=McAuliffe|editor-first=Jane Dammen|website=referenceworks.brillonline.com|type=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 August 2018|editor last name=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the closest religious analogy to contemporary literary close reading, and the principal historical connection with its birth, is the rise of the [[higher criticism]], and the evolution of [[textual criticism]] of the Bible in Germany in the late eighteenth century.

In the practice of literary studies, the technique of close reading emerged in 1920s Britain in the work of [[I. A. Richards]], his student [[William Empson]], and the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], all of whom sought to replace an "impressionistic" view of literature then dominant with what Richards called a "practical criticism" focused on language and form. American [[New Critics]] in the 1930s and 1940s anchored their views in similar fashion, and promoted close reading as a means of understanding that the autonomy of the work (often a poem) mattered more than anything else, including authorial intention, the cultural contexts of reception, and most broadly, ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13795373|title=Professing literature : an institutional history|last=Gerald,|first=Graff,|isbn=0226306038|location=Chicago|oclc=13795373}}&lt;/ref&gt;For these critics, including [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[John Crowe Ransom]], and [[Allen Tate]], only close reading, because of its attentiveness to the nuances and interrelation of language and form, could address the work in its complex unity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/297149196|title=American literary criticism since the 1930s|last=1944-|first=Leitch, Vincent B.,|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|others=Leitch, Vincent B., 1944-|isbn=0415778174|edition=2nd|location=London|oclc=297149196}}&lt;/ref&gt;Their influence on American literary criticism and English departments held sway for several decades, and even after New Criticism faded from prominence in American universities in the waning years of the Cold War, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13795373|title=Professing literature : an institutional history|last=Gerald,|first=Graff,|publisher=|year=|isbn=0226306038|location=Chicago|page=227|pages=|oclc=13795373}}&lt;/ref&gt;close reading remained a fundamental, almost naturalized, skill amongst literary critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10323916|title=The crisis in criticism : theory, literature, and reform in English studies|last=1952-|first=Cain, William E.,|date=1984|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0801831911|location=Baltimore|oclc=10323916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walhout|first=Mark|date=December 1987|title=The New Criticism and the Crisis of American Liberalism: The Poetics of the Cold War.|url=|journal=College English|volume=49|pages=861-871|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mao|first=Douglas|date=1996|title=The New Critics and the Text-Object|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30030280|journal=ELH|volume=63|pages=227-254|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;By the turn of the 21st century, efforts to historicize New Critical aesthetics and its apolitical pretense prompted scholars, especially in departments of English, to debate the fate of close reading, asking about its status as a critical practice.

In two of its 2010 bulletins, the American Departments of English (ADE) featured a cluster of articles that attempted to take stock of what the 21st century held for close reading. The articles were motivated, as all of the scholars remarked, by the changes they had observed in the work of their colleagues and students -- as well as in contemporary culture -- that made them think again about why close reading mattered to the study of literature. Jonathan Culler noted that because the discipline had taken close reading for granted, it had disappeared from discussions of the goals of literary criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|date=2012|title="The Closeness of Close Reading"|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;For Culler, as for Jane Gallop, that absence needed remedying, and therefore signaled an opportunity for departments of English to renew -- in order to capitalize on -- one of the more distinctive traits of studying literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898}}&lt;/ref&gt; If New Criticism and its isolationist stance had given away to the politicization of literary studies, and if technological developments were changing the very ways in which people read, Culler and Gallop emphasized that the signature of close reading, meticulous attention to the workings of language and form, still had value.N. Katherine Hayles and John Guillory, meanwhile, each interested in the impact of digital media on the ways people read, argued that close reading skills were not only translatable to the digital context, but could also exist productively alongside the hyper-reading that web interfaces and links had generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guillory|first=John|date=2012|title="Close Reading: Prologue and Epilogue"|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayles|first=N.

== Principles and Practice ==
While the New Criticism popularized close reading in universities, it tended to emphasize its principles and offer extended examples rather than prescribe specific methods and practices. This tendency towards what Vincent B. Leitch calls "canonical statements"&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/297149196|title=American literary criticism since the 1930s|last=1944-|first=Leitch, Vincent B.|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|others=Leitch, Vincent B., 1944-|isbn=0415778174|edition=2nd|location=London|oclc=297149196}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in essays and book-length studies, from John Crowe Ransom's "The New Criticism" (1949) and Allen Tate's "A Note on Autotelism" (1949), to Cleanth Brooks' ''[[The Well Wrought Urn]]'' (1947)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4908303|title=The well wrought urn : studies in the structure of poetry|last=1906-1994.|first=Brooks, Cleanth,|date=1947|publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World|others=ברוקס, קליאנת', 1906-1994.|isbn=0156957051|location=New York|oclc=4908303}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Rene Wellek and Austin Warren's ''[[Theory of Literature]]'' (1949)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1944737|title=Theory of literature|last=René|first=Wellek|date=1956|publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World|others=Warren, Austin, 1899-1986,|isbn=0156890844|edition=3d|location=New York,|oclc=1944737}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and W.K. Wimsatt's ''The Verbal Icon'' (1954).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/328522|title=The verbal icon : studies in the meaning of poetry|last=1907-1975.|first=Wimsatt, William K. (William Kurtz),|date=1954|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|isbn=0813101115|location=Lexington, Ky.|oclc=328522}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ten chapters of ''The Well Wrought Urn'' thus focus individually on poems across British literary history (John Donne, William Shakespeare, John Milton, Alexander Pope, Thomas Gray, John Keats, William Wordsworth, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, W.B. Yeats, and T.S. Eliot) before concluding with "The Heresy of Paraphrase," in which Brooks abstracts the premises on which his analyses rest. Meanwhile, when Wellek and Warren describe their preference for an "intrinsic" study of literature in ''Theory of Literature'', they refer to examples of elements they claim are crucial to a work -- from euphony, rhythm, and meter to image, metaphor, and myth -- and cite concrete examples of these drawn from literary history, but do not indicate steps by which readers might translate such thinking into their own analyses. Wimsatt takes a mixed approach in ''The Verbal Icon'', combining theoretical chapters ("The Intentional Fallacy," "The Affective Fallacy") with those that discuss concerns he feels are necessary to the study of poetry ("The Concrete Universal," "Symbol and Metaphor," "The Substantive Level," "One Relation of Rhyme to Reason," "When is Variation 'Elegant'?","Verbal Style: Logical and Counterlogical"), but he too leaves it to his readers to imagine how they might deploy these views.

As Culler notes in his essay for the 2010 bulletin of the American Departments of English, this tendency not to make statements of method meant that most students of the New Critics learned by example. Thus in the New Critical classroom, "the charismatic pedagogue could pose a question you had not thought of about relations between form and meaning or point to a textual difficulty that had escaped your attention."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|date=2012|title="The Closeness of Close Reading"|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|pages=23|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than fifty years later, this "closeness of close reading" remains vital to the work of more recent thinkers whose thinking has contributed to the radical changes in literary studies and displaced New Criticism. Of these he cites his contemporary, the deconstructionist Barbara Johnson, who stands out for her claim that the value of close reading lies in its capacity for taking seriously what does not immediately make sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65306717|title="Teaching Deconstructively"|last=Johnson|first=Barbara|date=1985|work=Writing and Reading Differently: Deconstruction and the Teaching of Composition and Literature|publisher=Univ. Press of Kansas|others=|year=1985|isbn=0700002839|editor-last=Atkins|editor-first=George Michael|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=140|oclc=65306717|editor-last2=Johnson|editor-first2=Michael L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;Well aware of the stark differences between New Criticism and deconstruction, Culler here brings the two together, suggesting that their shared investments indicate an understanding of close reading worth maintaining.

In French criticism, close reading is similar to ''[[explication de texte]]'', the tradition of textual interpretation in literary study, as proposed by [[Gustave Lanson]]. As an [[analytical technique]], ''close reading'' compares and contrasts the concept of ''distant reading'', the technique for “understanding literature, not by studying particular texts, but by aggregating and analyzing massive amounts of data”, as described, by Kathryn Schulz, in “What is Distant Reading?”, an article about the literary scholar [[Franco Moretti]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/books/review/the-mechanic-muse-what-is-distant-reading.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 "What is Distant Reading?" | New York Times article by Kathryn Schulz June 24, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Brooks's discussion of John Keats's "Ode to a Grecian Urn" embodies his use of close reading. In "Keats's Sylvan Historian," he finds the controversy over the poem's famous lines misplaced, and insists instead that "the ambiguity" of "Beauty is truth, truth beauty -- that is all/Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know" is best understood as an expression of the urn itself (151-153). The poem pursues this ambiguity, he writes, in lines that describe the urn on the one hand as a "bride of quietness" and a "foster-child of silence" and on the other, a "sylvan historian" (155). In this way the poem describes the urn in paradoxical terms much as the urn utters a paradoxical line. Brooks then pursues this logic by considering how "sylvan historian" might not only describe the urn as a kind of historian but also the kind of history the urn is said to tell. Further, if he claims that this history is uncertain because it's not clear "what men or gods" feature in it, he continues that line of thinking as he proceeds through the ode's stanzas: when he emphasizes that the "unheard melodies" of the figures depicted on the urn's face are "sweeter than any audible music," that "action goes on though the actors are motionless," that "the maiden, always to be kissed, never actually kissed," that the "boughs...cannot shed their leaves," and when he claims that this "ironic undercurrent" only increases over the course of the poem, to culminate in those infamous lines (156-159, 164). From following the poem in this way, Brooks arrives at the assertion that his interpretation is "derived from the context of the "Ode" itself" (164).

Brooks's close reading is typical of the New Critical investment in the textual object alone. Yet scholars have also found close reading productive for more politically and socially invested work, thereby refusing the New Critical belief in literary transcendence while seizing on the care with which it treated textuality. In ''The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination'' (1979), best known as one of the earliest statements of feminist literary criticism, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar deployed close reading to make a case for the distinctiveness of the female literary imagination. The sixteen chapters of ''Madwoman'' thus pursue their arguments -- that women writers expressed their anxiety about authorship, their rage over being constrained to docile femininity, their canny encoding of their patriarchal critique -- with the attention to language, imagery, and form Gilbert and Gubar had been trained to wield as graduate students in the late 1960s. New Critical echoes are thus evident in the individual chapters devoted to close readings of Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein'', Emily Bronte's ''Wuthering Heights'', Charlotte Bronte's ''The Professor'', ''Jane'' ''Eyre'', ''Shirley'', and ''Villette'', but so is the political innovation. Reviewers -- academic and mainstream -- recognized this trait, describing the two scholars as “gnostic heretics who claim to have found the secret code that unlocks the mysteries in old texts” (Schreiber 11)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schreiber|first=Le Anne|date=December 9, 1979|title="I'm Nobody, Who Are You?"|url=|journal=The New York Times Review of Books|volume=|pages=11, 32-3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;and their interpretations as a "skillful joint peeling away of the layers" of women's writing" (129).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolodny|first=Annette|date=March 1980|title=Rev. of The Madwoman in the Attic|url=|journal=American Literature|volume=52.1|pages=128-132|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an even more extreme example, [[Jacques Derrida]] in ''Ulysses Gramophone'' devotes more than eighty pages to the word "yes" in James Joyce's novel ''Ulysses'', an effort which [[J. Hillis Miller]] describes as a "hyperbolic, extravagant... explosion" of the technique of close reading.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. Hillis, "Derrida and literature" in ''Jacques Derrida and the Humanities: A Critical Reader'', Tom Cohen, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching close reading ==
The push for more close-reading instruction in primary and secondary education is partially due to increased feedback from college professors in the early-mid 2000s that students were arriving in university classrooms with few comprehension skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/dec12/vol70/num04/Closing-in-on-Close-Reading.aspx|title=Closing in on Close Reading - Educational Leadership|last=ASCD|website=www.ascd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased demand for students to acquire concrete skills in high school that they would need in transitioning to higher education and to adult life culminated in the creation of the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core State Standards]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/about-the-standards/|title=About the Standards {{!}} Common Core State Standards Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=www.corestandards.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has been a push for English Language Arts teachers, especially at the secondary level, to help students develop close-reading strategies. Several of the English Language Arts (ELA) Standards for Reading Literature require students to be able to cite direct textual evidence, and to analyze words in context. For example, CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.9-10.4 asks students to "Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in the text, including figurative and connotative meanings; analyze the cumulative impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone (e.g., how the language evokes a sense of time and place; how it sets a formal or informal tone)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/RL/9-10/|title=English Language Arts Standards » Reading: Literature » Grade 9-10 {{!}} Common Core State Standards Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=www.corestandards.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategies ===
Today, as most states have adopted the Common Core Standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/standards-in-your-state/|title=Standards in Your State {{!}} Common Core State Standards Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=www.corestandards.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is an increasing number of resources designed to help teachers instruct and implement close-reading strategies in their classrooms. In 2012, Kylene Beers and Robert E. Probst published ''Notice &amp; Note: Strategies for Close Reading'', which established six "signposts" that alert readers to significant moments in a work of literature and encourage students to read closely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heinemann.com/shared/onlineresources/e04693/noticenote_flyer.pdf|title=Notice &amp; Note: Strategies for Close Reading|last=Beers|first=Kylene|date=|website=Heinemann|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another resource, developed by Beth Burke ([[National Board Certified Teacher|NBCT]]) for the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' NIE (Newspaper in Education), presents the steps involved in close reading and how to [[Lev Vygotsky|scaffold]] the strategies for students. She recommends using the Gradual Release Model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nieonline.com/tbtimes/downloads/CCSS_reading.pdf|title=Closing in on Close Reading|last=Burke|first=Beth|date=|website=Tampa Bay Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in instruction, beginning by modeling a close reading in front of the class, then having students work on the strategy in groups before attempting it alone. 

Additional ways to support students in close-reading instruction include providing [[Graphic organizer|graphic organizers]] that help them group their ideas with textual evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edu.wyoming.gov/downloads/assessments/2014/close-reading-graphic-organizer.pdf|title=Close Reading Graphic Organizer|last=|first=|date=|website=State of Wyoming|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18474">'''Cognitive ecology''' is the study of cognitive phenomena within social and natural contexts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutchins|first=Edwin|date=2010-10-01|title=Cognitive Ecology|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01089.x/abstract|journal=Topics in Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=705–715|doi=10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01089.x|issn=1756-8765}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an integrative perspective drawing from aspects of [[ecological psychology]], [[cognitive science]], [[evolutionary ecology]] and [[anthropology]]. Notions of domain-specific [[Modularity of mind|modules in the brain]] and the cognitive biases they create are central to understanding the [[Enactivism|enacted]] nature of cognition within a cognitive ecological framework. This means that cognitive mechanisms not only shape the characteristics of thought, but they dictate the success of [[Dual inheritance theory|culturally transmitted ideas]]. Because [[Dual inheritance theory|culturally transmitted]] concepts can often inform ecological decision-making behaviors, group-level trends in cognition (i.e., culturally salient concepts) are hypothesized to address ecologically relevant challenges.&lt;ref name="botero"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Botero|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Gardner|first2=Beth|last3=Kirby|first3=Kathryn R.|last4=Bulbulia|first4=Joseph|last5=Gavin|first5=Michael C.|last6=Gray|first6=Russell D.|title=The ecology of religious beliefs|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=25 November 2014|volume=111|issue=47|pages=16784–16789|doi=10.1073/pnas.1408701111|pmc=4250141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical basis ==
Cognitive ecology explores the interactive relationship between organism-environment interactions and its impact on cognitive phenomena.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Human cognition in this framework is multimodal and viewed similarly to [[Enactivism|enactivist]] perspectives on cognitive processing. For cultural concepts, this emphasizes cognitive distribution across an ecosystem, which is predicated on models of the [[extended mind thesis]].

=== Ecological psychology ===
While the multi-faceted nature of cognitive ecology is a consequence of its interdisciplinary history, it primarily derives from early work in ecological psychology. Paradigm shifts from behaviorist orientations of psychology to cognition, or the "cognitive revolution",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=George A|title=The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=March 2003|volume=7|issue=3|pages=141–144|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00029-9|pmid=12639696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="neisser"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neisser|first1=Ulric|title=Cognitive psychology.|date=1967|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New York|isbn=978-0131396678}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave rise to the ecological psychology approach, which distanced itself from mainstream [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] views by breaking down the common mind-environment dichotomy of psychological theory.&lt;ref name=":heft"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heft|first1=Harry|title=An ecological approach to psychology.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=2013|volume=17|issue=2|pages=162–167|doi=10.1037/a0032928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One particularly influential progenitor of this work was ecological psychologist [[James J. Gibson|James Gibson]], whose legacy is marked by his ideas on ecological and social [[affordance]]s. These are the opportunistic features of environmental objects that can be exploited for human use, and are therefore particularly perceptible (e.g., a knob affords twisting, an agreeable social cue affords a warm reaction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chemero|first1=Anthony|title=An outline of a theory of affordances|journal=Ecological Psychology|date=2003|volume=15|issue=2|pages=181–195|doi=10.1207/s15326969eco1502_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson argued further that organisms cannot be disentangled from their environments, and that their cognitive constraints were consequences of a limited set of environmental invariants which shaped them over evolutionary time.&lt;ref name=":heft" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=James J.|title=The ecological approach to visual perception|date=1986|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York|isbn=0898599598|edition=[Nachdr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; An illustrative example for Gibson is the human capacity for three-dimensional visual perception, which he argues is a cognitive concept resulting from the way that people interact with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=James|title=The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception|date=1979|isbn=978-1848725782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another foreshadowed element of cognitive ecological theory comes from ecological anthropologist [[Gregory Bateson]], who considered the notion of informational feedback loops between mind and environment, particularly their role in generating meaning and awareness of one's surroundings. In an essay, he speculates on how an observer might best delineate the "self" of a blind man. In his treatment, he questions whether one may arbitrarily choose to carve out the man's informational processing loop at his brain or his hands or his walking stick without offering an incomplete view of his cognitive process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bateson|first1=Gregory|title=Steps to an ecology of mind|date=2000|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago [u.a.]|isbn=0-226-03905-6|edition=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discussion of concept remains influential in modern cognitive ecological considerations of the densely interconnected elements of ecology that play relevant roles in cognition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Enactivism ===
An enactive perspective of cognition is fundamental to a cognitive ecological view.&lt;ref name=":enactive"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palacios|first1=AG|last2=Bozinovic|first2=F|title=An "enactive" approach to integrative and comparative biology: thoughts on the table.|journal=Biological research|date=2003|volume=36|issue=1|pages=101–5|pmid=12795209|doi=10.4067/s0716-97602003000100008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a passive interpretation of internally represented information, cognition is considered to be an active process involving the transformation of information into meaningful relationships between the organism and its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noë|first1=Alva|title=Action in perception|date=2004|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262140888|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; For humans then, a perceived environment is only constructed insofar as cognitive constraints will allow. In other words, they "enact a world" by building perspectives out of ecological information, using their evolved cognitive equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=edited by John|last2=Gapenne,|first2=Olivier|last3=Paolo|first3=Ezequiel A. Di|title=Enaction Toward a New Paradigm for Cognitive Science.|date=2014|publisher=Bradford Books|isbn=978-0262526012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extended cognition ==
Cognitive ecology borrows ideas from views of [[extended cognition]], as articulated by Chalmers and Clark (1998). They argue that humans cognitively utilize elements of their environment to aid the cognitive process and further entangle the mind-environment relationship as a result. They illustrate their claim with a hypothetical example of two people who achieve the same navigational success through a museum by different means; a person with Alzheimer's may use a notebook with written directions, while another may use her memory. The primary difference between the two people is that the former outsourced his memory to readily available external representations of information about the museum, whereas the latter relied on internal representations. A variant of this concept they also consider is socially extended cognition, which is a similar outsourcing of cognitive representations into other peoples' minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=A.|last2=Chalmers|first2=D.|title=The Extended Mind|journal=Analysis|date=1 January 1998|volume=58|issue=1|pages=7–19|doi=10.1093/analys/58.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas elaborate a cognitive interpretation of broader anthropological notions maintaining that humans are a species deeply entangled in social and material elements of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hodder|first1=Ian|title=Entangled. ; An Archaeology of the Relationships Between Humans and Things.|date=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-470-67212-9|edition=first publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distributed cognition ===
[[Distributed cognition]] is an important model of the extended mind thesis for cognitive ecological theory put forth by Edwin Hutchins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutchins|first1=Edwin|title=Distributed cognition|journal=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cogwild"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutchins|first1=Edwin|title=Cognition in the wild|date=1996|publisher=The MIT Press (A Bradford Book)|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262581462|edition=8. pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conceptualizes human groups as active networks with cognitive properties of their own, much like neural networks themselves yield emergent cognitive properties. For a social group, cognitive properties are disseminated into an individual's surrounding network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heylighen|first1=Heath|author2=Van Overwalle|title=The Emergence of Distributed Cognition: a conceptual framework|journal=Proceedings of Collective Intentionality IV|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cognitive properties of a group, Hutchins notes, is completely distinct from a given those of an individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Distributed cognition is fundamentally contingent on and emergent from trending ideas among a collection of brains and artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Ellis|title=Distributed Cognition: an alternative framework for analysing and explaining collaborative working|journal=Journal of Information Technology|date=1994|volume=9|issue=2|pages=119–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing models of cultural learning dynamics seem to articulate the mechanisms by which information is acquired by and distributed within groups. In particular, [[cultural evolution]] theorists assert that individual learning is required for tracking environmental dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henrich|first1=Joseph|last2=McElreath|first2=Richard|title=The evolution of cultural evolution|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|date=19 May 2003|volume=12|issue=3|pages=123–135|doi=10.1002/evan.10110}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this information is retained in culture by social learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=R.|last2=Richerson|first2=P. J.|last3=Henrich|first3=J.|title=The cultural niche: Why social learning is essential for human adaptation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=20 June 2011|volume=108|issue=Supplement_2|pages=10918–10925|doi=10.1073/pnas.1100290108|pmid=21690340|pmc=3131818}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hutchins, this theoretical similarity is not a coincidence. After describing distributed cognitive networks and their relationships with ecological dynamics as "cognitive ecosystems", he defines culture as a "shorthand way of referring to a complex cognitive ecosystem."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Applications to cultural concepts ==

=== Religious beliefs ===
{{main|Cognitive ecology of religion}}
Religious behaviors typically exist in the form of ritual and correspond to religious god concepts.&lt;ref name="pursosis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purzycki &amp; Sosis|editor1-last=Ulrich|editor1-first=Frey|title=Essential Building Blocks of Human Nature|date=2011|chapter=Our Gods: Variation in Supernatural Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors are phenotypic outcomes of god concepts that are ultimately subject to natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Codding|first1=Brian F.|last2=Bird|first2=Douglas W.|title=Behavioral ecology and the future of archaeological science|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=April 2015|volume=56|pages=9–20|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2015.02.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cronk|first1=Lee|title=Human Behavioral Ecology|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=1991|volume=20|issue=1|pages=25–53|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.20.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognitive ecology of religion|Cognitive ecologists who study religion]] predict that god concepts across cultures can be linked to [[Coordination game|coordination solutions]] for local socioecological challenges, such as large-scale cooperation, intragroup cohesion and commitment, and resource management.&lt;ref name="botero"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Religion, Cognitive Science and Experimental Philosophy|last=Purzycki|first=|last2=McNamara|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=An Ecological Theory of Gods' Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an omniscient and morally punitive "Big God" may be adaptive for large-scale populations by motivating prosocial behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|last2=Shariff|first2=Azim F.|last3=Gervais|first3=Will M.|last4=Willard|first4=Aiyana K.|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita A.|last6=Slingerland|first6=Edward|last7=Henrich|first7=Joseph|title=The cultural evolution of prosocial religions|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2 December 2014|volume=39|doi=10.1017/S0140525X14001356}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas gods associated with small-scale societies are often concerned about the stability of local resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=The Evolution of Gods' Minds in the Tyva Republic|journal=Current Anthropology|date=13 April 2016|pages=S000–S000|doi=10.1086/685729|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic exchange ===
Social contracts and their associated fairness norms are thought by many economists to be contingent on means of production. A hunter-gatherer society, for instance, may operate at an equilibrium where each person contributes to the best of his or her ability and receives according to need. But if this society were to shift toward larger-scale agricultural practices, this equilibrium would be destabilized by increases in free riding and general temptations to profit by defecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Binmore|first1=Ken|title=Economic man – or straw man?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=22 December 2005|volume=28|issue=06|doi=10.1017/S0140525X05230145}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been supported empirically in cross-cultural studies using [[Experimental economics|experimental economic]] game data, which showed a wide range of variance in fairness expectations between populations based on culturally-specific exchange concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henrich|first1=Boyd|author2=Bowles|author3=Camerer|author4=Fehr|author5=Gintis|author6=McElreath|author7=Aivard|author8=Barr|author9=Ensminger|author10=Henrich|author11=Hill|author12=Gil-White|author13=Gurven|author14=Marlowe|author15=Patton|author16=Tracer|title="Economic man" in cross-cultural perspective: Behavioral experiments in 15 small-scale societies|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2005|volume=28|doi=10.1017/s0140525x05000142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gachter|first1=S.|last2=Herrmann|first2=B.|last3=Thoni|first3=C.|title=Culture and cooperation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2 August 2010|volume=365|issue=1553|pages=2651–2661|doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This shift in fairness expectations has also been implicated in archaeological data. In particular, the relaxed sharing norms hypothesized to be built upon periods of successful maize exploitation in the pre-Hispanic Pueblo Southwest seemed to be eroded by decreases in agricultural success. In other words, when crops began to fail and supply became low, cultural exchange norms became more stringent, kin-based and based on [[Reciprocal altruism|reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bocinsky|first1=R. K.|last2=Rush|first2=J.|last3=Kintigh|first3=K. W.|last4=Kohler|first4=T.

[[File:Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (logo).gif|right]]
The '''Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences''' ('''CIRES''') is a research institute that is sponsored jointly by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]] (OAR) and the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] (CU). CIRES scientists study the Earth system, including the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], [[cryosphere]], [[biosphere]], and [[geosphere]], and communicate these findings to decision makers, the scientific community, and the public.

It is one of 16 NOAA Cooperative Institutes (CIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Cooperative Institutes |publisher = NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research |date = |url = http://ci.noaa.gov/ |accessdate = 2014-04-26 |archiveurl = |archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and research==
CIRES was established in 1967 and is the oldest and largest of NOAA’s cooperative institutes nationwide. CIRES facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers at the University of Colorado and NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), [[National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service]] (NESDIS), and the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS).

CIRES includes more than 800 scientists, staff, and students, and CIRES scientists publish more than 500 [[peer review]]ed publications annually. Examples of research focused upon societal needs include monitoring changes in the atmospheric concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es, assessing the health of Earth’s [[ozone layer]], projecting the impacts of [[climate change]] on [[water supply]] and other critical resources, documenting the thinning of [[Polar ice cap|polar ice]], monitoring the quality of the [[Air quality|air]] and [[Water quality|water]], helping to respond to [[drought]] and [[wildfire]], developing microbial agents for degrading environmental [[pollutant]]s, improving [[earthquake]] predictions, and providing decision makers with information for more effective [[risk assessment]]s.

The current director of CIRES is the former NASA Chief Scientist, [[Waleed Abdalati]].

==Divisions==
'''Cryospheric and Polar Processes Division''' ('''CPP''')
The cryosphere comprises Arctic climate, [[ice sheet]]s and [[glacier]]s, [[snow cover]] and snow hydrology, and [[permafrost]]. Cryospheric and Polar Processes Division research at CIRES combines data collection, modeling, and data analysis to understand how the cryosphere influences, and responds to, changes in the global climate.

Another major activity of this division is archiving and distributing satellite information about the cryosphere in the Snow and Ice Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) as a part of NASA's [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS) Data and Information Center. These data increase scientists’ understanding of how the cryosphere is changing and the global impacts of those changes.

'''Ecosystem Science Division''' ('''ES''')
This division research focuses on water quality, land-atmosphere exchanges, and regional and global disturbances. Research focuses on topics such as bacteria that break down environmental toxins; [[land use]] changes; nutrient and pollutant studies in lakes and streams; biogenic emissions of important [[trace gas]]es to the atmosphere; and protection of crops against [[frost]].

'''Environmental Chemistry Division''' ('''EC''')
Research topics include measurements and analysis of pollutants and naturally occurring compounds, reaction kinetics, surface science, and analytical instrumentation development. Recent studies cover wide-ranging subjects including [[acid rain]], air and water pollution like that occurring in the Denver brown cloud, and climate change resulting from emission of [[carbon dioxide]] and other pollutants. Other areas of research include stratospheric [[ozone depletion]], tropospheric photochemical oxidant formation, and the increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases.

'''Environmental Observations, Modeling and Forecasting Division''' ('''EOMF''')
This division focuses on increasing understanding of interactive processes in the Earth's physical environment and developing a clearer picture of its sensitivities to natural and human-caused change. One chief area of study is the greenhouse effect and how to determine the onset of a theoretically predicted warming. 

'''Solid Earth Sciences Division''' ('''SES''')
Active research areas in [[geophysics]] include earthquake prediction; studies of the size, shape, and dynamic forces of [[Earth]]; [[isotope geochemistry]]; and the behavior of Earth’s [[Core of the Earth|core]] and [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. This research involves the use of [[seismography]], analytical and numerical modeling efforts, and [[space geodetic techniques]], such as laser ranging, artificial satellites, and interferometric observations of radio waves emanating from deep space. 

An important component of CIRES research in [[geodesy]]/[[geodynamics]] is participation in the multi-university consortium developed to assemble, test, and administer the deployment of instrument packages that use radio signals from [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) satellites to determine distances between points on Earth’s surface. The scientific objective is to monitor crustal deformation in tectonically active areas.

'''Weather and Climate Dynamics Division''' ('''WCD''')
This division focuses on understanding how global processes are intertwined to create the [[weather]] and [[climate]] observed from the [[troposphere]] to the [[mesosphere]]. This includes observational and theoretical research on the interactive boundary layers; the [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) and its effects on climate prediction; global waves and [[turbulence]] in the [[stratosphere]]; and fine-scale turbulence in the [[Planetary boundary layer|boundary layer]].

==Centers and programs==
CIRES supports four centers that provide the functional link between NOAA and 11 departments at the University of Colorado Boulder. The centers include the: 
* Center for Limnology, studying lakes, streams, and wetlands; 
* Center for Science and Technology Policy Research (CSTPR), which conducts research and education to meet the needs of public and private decision makers for [[environmental science]] information; 
* Earth Science and Observation Center (ESOC), focusing on the development and application of [[remote sensing]] techniques for studying all aspects of the Earth system; 
* [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]] (NSIDC), which studies Earth’s frozen realms (called the cryosphere), including floating [[sea ice]], lake ice, glaciers, ice sheets, snow cover, and permafrost.

CIRES also has two interdisciplinary programs: Western Water Assessment (WWA) and Education and Outreach. WWA is one of 11 NOAA-funded Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA) programs across the country. WWA researchers, specializing in climate, water, [[ecology]], law, and the [[social sciences]], work with decision makers across the [[Western United States|West]] to produce useful, policy-relevant information about climate variability and change.

'''Cruciform passage graves''' describe a complex example of prehistoric [[passage grave]] found in [[Ireland]], west [[Wales]] and [[Orkney]] and built during the later [[Neolithic]], from around 3500 BC and later.

They are distinguished by a long passage  leading to a central chamber with a [[corbel]]led roof. From this, burial chambers extend in three directions, giving the overall impression in plan of a cross shape layout. Some examples have further sub-chambers leading off the three original chambers. The network of chambers is covered by a [[cairn]] and revetted with a [[Megalithic architectural elements|kerb]].

A common trait is [[megalithic art]] carved into the stones of the chambers' walls and roofs. Abstract designs were favoured, especially spirals and zig-zags.

Examples are [[Newgrange]] in Ireland, [[Maeshowe]] in Orkney and [[Barclodiad y Gawres]] in [[Anglesey]].

Data that is commingled can present a security vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/assessing-data-risks-in-a-hybrid-cloud-environment.html |title=Assessing Data Risks in a Hybrid Cloud Environment |publisher=dummies.com |accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Data commingling can also occur due to high speed data transmission mixing. In this situation, data of one security level can inadvertently or purposely be mixed with data of a lower or higher security level on the same transmission portal. Portal vehicles can be wire, fiber optics, microwave or various radio frequency transmission portals. This commingling can cause breaches of security and become a source of legal issues to any entity, corporation or individual.
 
Data commingling can also occur when personal computers and personal software programs are used for business, security, government, etc. uses. In the early formulation stages of entities, non-profit or profit corporations, LLC's, LLP's, etc., the creation and use of stand-alone computers and stand-alone networks, "absolutely unconnected" to involved individuals, is the easiest and safest way to prevent Data Commingling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://betanews.com/2009/12/07/more-employees-are-using-a-personal-laptop-as-primary-work-pc/ |title=More employees are using a personal laptop as primary work PC |publisher=betanews.com |accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|information on obtaining a database dump of the Wikipedia contents|Wikipedia:Database dump}}
A '''database dump''' (also: '''SQL dump''') contains a record of the [[Table (database)|table]] structure and/or the data from a [[database]] and is usually in the form of a list of [[SQL]] statements. A database dump is most often used for [[backup|backing up]] a database so that its contents can be restored in the event of [[data loss]]. [[Data corruption|Corrupted]] databases can often be recovered by analysis of the dump. Database dumps are often published by [[free software]] and [[free content]] projects, to allow reuse or [[Fork (software development)|forking]] of the database.

=== Illinois ===
[[Argyle Lake State Park]]'s website says the Argyle Hollow (occupied by a lake since 1948) has been rich in coal, clay and limestone resources. Historically, individuals commonly opened and dug their own "drift mines" to supplement their income.&lt;ref&gt;"Argyle Lake State Park." About.

=== Ohio ===
In the 1880s, State Inspector of Mines, Andrew Roy, issued a report on the Mines and Mining Resources of Ohio,&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Andrew. "Mines and Mining Resources of Ohio." Mines and Mining Resources of Ohio. 1888. Accessed December 28, 2015. &lt;http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~henryhowesbook/mines.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the following paragraphs:

{{Quote|
The capacity or output of the mines of the State varies greatly. Thick coals are capable of a greater daily output than thin seams, and as a general rule drift mines possess greater advantages for loading coal rapidly than [[shaft mining]] openings. In many of the mines of the great vein region of the Hocking valley the capacity is equal to 1,200 to 1,500 tons per day. In shaft mines 600 to 700 tons daily is regarded as a good output.

The first ton of coal in a shaft mine 100 feet in depth and having a daily capacity of 600 tons frequently costs the mining adventurer upwards of $20,000 (1888), and cases are on record where owing to the extraordinary amount of water in sinking, $100,000 (1888) have been expended before coal was reached. Drift mines, as they require no machinery for pumping water and raising coal, cost less than half the amount required in shaft mining.

Water is, however, an expensive item in drift mines opened on the [[dip slope]] of the coal, and underground hauling under such conditions is unusually costly.

== Historical US drift mining (gold) ==
=== Alaska ===
Drift mining methods were used extensively to mine [[placer deposit]]s during the early years (1899- ) of the [[Nome mining district]].  During summer, surface deposits could be worked, but some placer deposits were buried too deeply for surface placering.  In addition, water to wash the gold from the placers was not available in the winter.  Many miners tunneled into deep placer deposits, bringing out the high-grade gravels to be washed at the spring thaw.  Most of the ground in [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] is [[permafrost]].  By drift mining, miners were able to recover much of the gold buried under the permafrost.

Gold at Nome was concentrated in three ancient beach lines, now inshore, above sea level, and buried under roughly fifty feet of [[permafrost]] overlain by two feet of [[tundra]].  Gold was usually found on top of "false bedrock," a layer of clay that occurred at the base of the beach or stream deposit.  Miners initially sank shafts to prospect for the pay streaks by building a fire atop the permafrost, then as it melted, shoveling away the mud.  The process would continue down to either a pay streak or bedrock.

When gold was found drift mining began.  Miners would tunnel horizontally from the bottom of their prospect shaft to follow the gold along the surface of the bedrock.  The tunnels did not cave in because the ground was frozen.  Miners discovered old underground beach and river gravels rich with gold.  Around 1900 the population of Nome was more than twenty thousand, many of them drift miners.  Nome's gold fields, appearing untouched from the surface, are honeycombed with tunnels left by the gold rush drift miners.  Today's miners, prospecting with modern drilling equipment, sometimes hit old drifts; this was, and is, a technique copied from the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] coal miners of south [[Wales]] and is much more effective than using [[bell pit]]s.

=== California ===
Gold has been mined from [[placer mining|placer]] gold deposits up and down the state and in different types of environment. Initially, rich, easily discovered, surface and river placers were mined until about 1864. Hydraulic mines, using powerful water cannons to wash whole hillsides, were the chief sources of gold for the next 20 years. In 1884, Judge [[Lorenzo Sawyer]] issued a decree prohibiting the dumping of hydraulic mining debris into the [[Sacramento River]], effectively eliminating large-scale hydraulic operations. For the next 14 years, drift mining placer gold deposits in buried Tertiary channels partially made up for the loss of placer gold production, but overall production declined.  Production rose again with the advent of large-scale dredging.  The first successful gold dredge was introduced on the lower [[Feather River]] near [[Oroville, California|Oroville]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Silva, Michael. "Placer Gold Recovery Methods (SP87)."

[[File:Hillseam.png|thumb|Profile of hillseam occurrence]]
Drift mines in eastern Kentucky are subject to roof collapse due to hillseams, especially within 100 feet of the portal.

In 1989 the U.S. Bureau of Mines published a study of eastern Kentucky drift mines as part of an ongoing research program to characterize the outcrop barrier zone. "Hillseams" were identified as the dominant geologic cause of roof instability unique to the outcrop barrier zone, with many roof fall injuries and fatalities attributed to them. Hillseam is the eastern Kentucky miners term for weather-enlarged tension joints that occur in shallow mine [[overburden]] where surface slopes are steep. Hillseams are most conspicuous within 200&amp;nbsp;ft laterally of a coalbed outcrop and under 300&amp;nbsp;ft or less of overburden. Hillseams form by stress relief, and therefore tend to parallel topographic contours and ridges. They can intersect at various angles, especially under the nose of a ridge, and create massive blocks or wedges of roof prone to failure. Examples of hillseams are described in both outcrop and in coal mine roof to establish their geologic character and contribution to roof failure.&lt;ref&gt;Sames, Gary, and Noel Moebs. "Hillseam Geology and Roof Instability near Outcrop in Eastern Kentucky Drift Mines." U.S. Bureau of Mines. 1989. Accessed December 28, 2015. &lt;http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/10524/cdc_10524_DS1.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ectogenesis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ecto'', "outer," and ''[[wikt:genesis|genesis]]'') is the growth of an organism in an artificial environment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/ectogenesis yourdictionary.com &gt; ectogenesis] In turn citing: Webster's New World College Dictionary, 2010 by Wiley Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; outside the body in which it would normally be found, such as the growth of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] outside the mother's body, or the growth of bacteria outside the body of a host.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/Ectogenesis ectogenesis]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved September 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by British scientist [[J.B.S. Haldane]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Artificial Wombs Are Coming, but the Controversy Is Already Here |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/artificial-wombs-are-coming-and-the-controversys-already-here |work=Motherboard |date=4 August 2014 |accessdate=16 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ECTOGENESIS: A REPLY TO SINGER AND WELLS|first=DAVID N.|last=JAMES|date=1 January 1987|journal=Bioethics|volume=1|issue=1|pages=80–99|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.1987.tb00006.x|pmid = 11649763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human embryos and fetuses==
{{Further|Artificial uterus}}
Ectogenesis of human embryos and fetuses would require an [[artificial uterus]]. An artificial uterus would have to be supplied by nutrients and oxygen from some source to nurture a fetus, as well as dispose of waste material. There would likely be a need for an interface between such a supplier, filling this function of the [[placenta]]. An artificial uterus, as a replacement organ, could be used to assist women with damaged, diseased or removed uteri to avail the fetus to be conceived to term. It also has the potential to move the threshold of fetal viability to a much earlier stage of pregnancy. This would have implications for the ongoing controversy regarding human [[reproductive rights]].

Ectogenesis could also be a means by which [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] and single men could have genetic offspring without the use of [[surrogate pregnancy]] or a [[sperm donor]], and allow women to have children without going through the pregnancy cycle.

==Bioethical considerations==
The development of artificial uteri and ectogenesis raises a few [[bioethics|bioethical]] and legal considerations, and also has important implications for [[reproductive rights]] and the [[abortion debate]].

Artificial uteri may expand the range of [[fetal viability]], raising questions about the role that fetal viability plays within [[abortion law]]. Within severance theory, for example, abortion rights only include the right to remove the fetus, and do not always extend to the termination of the fetus. If transferring the fetus from a woman's womb to an artificial uterus is possible, the choice to terminate a pregnancy in this way could provide an alternative to aborting the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Randall|first=Vernellia|author2=Randall, Tshaka C.|title=Built in Obsolescence: The Coming End to the Abortion Debate|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|date=22 March 2008|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1112367|url=https://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=vernellia_randall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chessen|first1=Matt|title=Artificial Wombs Could Outlaw Abortion|url=http://www.mattlesnake.com/2013/03/02/artificial-wombs-could-outlaw-abortion/|website=Mattlesnake.com|date=2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also theoretical concerns that children who develop in an artificial uterus may lack "some essential bond with their mothers that other children have";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smajdor|first=Anna|title=The Moral Imperative for Ectogenesis|journal=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics|date=Summer 2007|volume=16|issue=3|pages=336–45|pmid=17695628|url=http://annasmajdor.me.uk/ectogenesis_final.pdf|doi=10.1017/s0963180107070405}}&lt;/ref&gt; a secondary issue to woman's rights over their own body.

In the 1970 book ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'', feminist [[Shulamith Firestone]] wrote that differences in biological reproductive roles are a source of [[gender inequality]]. Firestone singled out pregnancy and childbirth, making the argument that an artificial womb would free "women from the tyranny of their reproductive biology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chemaly|first=Soraya|title=What Do Artificial Wombs Mean for Women?|url=http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2012/02/23/what-do-artificial-wombs-mean-women/|newspaper=RH Reality Check|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Christine|title=Why Not Artificial Wombs?|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/docLib/TNA03-Rosen.pdf|newspaper=The New Atlantis|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental restoration''' is closely allied with (or perhaps sometimes used interchangeably with) ''[[ecological restoration]]'' or ''[[environmental remediation]]''.  In the U.S., remediation is the term used more in the realms of industry, public policy, and the civil services.

In the 1987 edition of his book ''Restoring the Earth: How Americans are Working to Renew our Damaged Environment'', scientific editor and writer [[John Berger (author)|John J. Berger]] defined environmental restoration (or “natural resource restoration”) as follows: ''"… A process in which a damaged resource is renewed.  Biologically. Structurally. Functionally."''

==Natural environment==
The ongoing growth of human population in the world and its associated impacts,{{why|date=March 2012}} mean that the need for ecological restoration has become increasingly clear.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The old adage "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" points to the fact that ecological restoration is not always successful (or only over long spans of time) and, when feasible, is often difficult and expensive. Environmental restoration is often neglected, either being overlooked or being deemed inexpedient or of a low priority. However, in much of the industrialized world, it has been increasingly demanded by the public, at least since the early 1970s if not before.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The interest and activity in environmental restoration has given rise to a new branch of research and applied techniques within biology, [[restoration ecology]].

Environmental restoration has been applied in aquatic situations ([[lake]]s, [[stream]]s, [[river]]s, [[wetland]]s, etc.) and terrestrial ones (grasslands, [[forest]]s, [[desert]]s, flatlands, hill country, mountain slopes, etc.).

==Approaches==
Environmental restoration involves many different approaches and technologies depending on the requirements of the situation. It can involve [[heavy equipment]] like cranes, [[grader]]s, [[bulldozer]]s, or [[excavator]]s, and also hand processes like the planting of trees and other vegetation. It can involve high-tech processes such as those applied in the careful environmental control required in fish-hatchery procedures. Today, computerized regulation is often being utilized in these processes. Computer-based mapping has also become an important dimension of restorative work, as has [[computer modeling]].

In some situations, environmental restorative work is handled entirely by professionals working with skilled operators and technicians. In others, ordinary local community members may do much of the work, acquiring skills as the project proceeds. An example of this approach can be seen in Project Maitai&lt;ref&gt;[https://arcg.is/1XCCrj Project Maitai]&lt;/ref&gt; where the Nelson City Council, New Zealand, has worked with community groups, such as Friends of the Maitai and local schools, to restore the [[Maitai River]] and its tributaries.

==Ecological restoration markets==
Although the international field of restoration is driven primarily by the non-profit, government and academic sectors, in the U.S and certain other countries (e.g. Australia, which has a robust mining restoration sector), there are active markets for ecological restoration. The U.S. market blossomed shortly after U.S. created a law that prevents the loss of streams and wetlands under the [[Clean Water Act]] and in the wake of the passage of the [[Endangered Species Act]]. The Under Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 also created restoration opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zipper|first1=CE|last2=Burger|first2=JA|last3=Skousen|first3=JG|last4=Angel|first4=PN|title=Restoring forests and associated ecosystem services on appalachian coal surface mines|journal=Environmental management|volume=47|issue=5|pages=751–756|doi=10.1007/s00267-011-9670-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; When regulations stemming from these laws came online in the mid-1980s, there were few firms that were qualified or experienced in performing large-scale restoration projects. The first estimate of the dollars and jobs in the U.S. was $9.5 billion in annual sales, with 126,000 people employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=BenDor|first1=JM|last2=Newton|first2=AC|last3=Diaz|first3=A|last4=Bullock|first4=JM|title=Estimating the Size and Impact of the Ecological Restoration Economy|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2015|volume=10|issue=6|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0128339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2561">'''Ethnodoxology''' is an application of [[ethnomusicology]], ethnic arts studies, worship studies, [[missiology]], and related disciplines. Those in this field study local musical traditions and work with local musicians and churches to adapt and develop locally created musical forms for Christian worship. Examples of such work include engaging a local praise singer in translating and singing Mary's [[Magnificat]],&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Wedekind. 1975. "The praise singers." ''The Bible Translator'' 26: 245-47.&lt;/ref&gt; developing local hymns, leading people in creating localized forms of liturgy,&lt;ref&gt;Kedra Larsen. 2009. Bokyi and Yala Lutheran liturgy in song. MA thesis, Bethel University.&lt;/ref&gt; sharing examples of starting points for people interested in utilizing local arts but not knowing where to start.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Balonek. 2009. "You Can Use That in the Church?" Musical Contextualization and the Sinhala Church. MA Thesis, Bethel University. Also at: https://www.amazon.com/That-Church-Musical-Contextualization-Sinhala/dp/1463759061&lt;/ref&gt; A broad resource for those in the field is a pair of volumes: ''Worship and Mission for the Global Church: An Ethnodoxology Handbook''&lt;ref&gt;James Krabill, ed. 2013. William Carey Library.&lt;/ref&gt; and its how-to companion ''Creating Local Arts Together: A Manual to Help Communities Reach their Kingdom Goals''.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Schrag, ed. 2013. William Carey Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''International Council of Ethnodoxologists'' define ethnodoxology as;

:''"the [[theological]] and [[anthropological]] study, and practical application, of how every culture group might use its unique and diverse [[artistic]] expressions appropriately to worship the [[God]] of the [[Bible]]."''

The term was coined by Dave Hall, a pioneer of the school of ethnodoxology and founder of ''Worship From The Nations''.

Hall states;

:''I define ethnodoxology as "the study of the worship of God among diverse cultures" or, more precisely, "the theological and practical study of how and why people of diverse cultures praise and glorify the true and living God as revealed in the Bible." The term finds its source in 2 Biblical Greek words. "Ethno," from the Greek word "ethne" meaning 'peoples' or 'people groups' and "[[doxology]]," from the Greek word "doxos" meaning 'glory' or 'praise.'''

== Disconnect from money ==

[[Consumerism]] features an increasingly cashless society with payment options including checks, credit cards, debit cards, money orders, small dollar loans and store-value cards, as well as various direct deposit methods for income and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Raghubir, P., &amp; Srivastava, J. (2008). Monopoly money: The effect of payment coupling and form on spending behavior. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 14(3), 213–225.&lt;/ref&gt; When individuals have less direct and physical contact with their money, they disconnect from it. This prevents them from knowing or understanding how much money they have, or how their spending impacts their financial circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Raghubir, P., &amp; Srivastava, J. (2008).

== Determinants of financial behavior ==

Individuals' financial behavior is influenced by many internal and external factors. Internal elements include individual [[psychology]], family history and environment&lt;ref&gt;Nyhus, E. K., &amp; Webley, P. (2001). The role of personality in household saving and borrowing behaviour. European Journal of Personality, 15, s85–s103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shim, S., Xiao, J. J., Barber, B. L., &amp; Lyons, A. C. (2009). Pathways to life success: A conceptual model of financial well-being for young adults. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 30, 708–723.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xiao, J. J., Collins, M., Ford, M., Keller, P., Kim, J., &amp; Robles, B. (2010). The NEFE quarter century project: 25 Years of research in financial education: Theme 2: A Review of financial behavior research: Implications for financial education. Denver: National Endowment for Financial Education.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents' values and beliefs on the importance of saving vs. spending and overall materialism impact their children's money values and beliefs; they transmit these money lessons primarily through modeling and discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Webley, P., &amp; Nyhus, E. K. (2006). Parent's influence on children's future orientation and saving.

Denver: National Endowment for Financial Education.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, self-worth, net worth and social signaling play a role on individuals' purchasing habits. 
People with limited funds, or those trying to keep up with another's lifestyle often suffer from low self-esteem. This results in feeling unworthy of a better financial future and behaving in self-sabotaging ways such as overspending on high-status items.&lt;ref&gt;Sivanathan, N., &amp; Pettit, N. C. (2010). Protecting the self through consumption: Status goods as affirmational
commodities. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 46, 564–570.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfsohn, R. (2012a). Financial social work basics and best practices. Retrieved from http://www.financialsocialwork.com/tools/financial-social-work-ebook#.UI66hELJDzI&lt;/ref&gt;

Improved financial circumstances require increased self-awareness because every financial decision is impacted by an individual's thoughts, feelings and attitudes about money which are often more unconscious than conscious.&lt;ref&gt;Vitt, L. (2009). Values centered financial education: Understanding cultural influences on learners' financial behaviors. Denver: National Endowment for Financial Education. Retrieved from http://www.smartaboutmoney.org/Portals/0/lifevalue/financialeducation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Financial Social Work model incorporates the [[transformative learning]] approach to expand self-awareness, sense of self and provide financial knowledge. As individuals gain more insight into why and how their thoughts and attitudes about money developed, they are more likely to make deep, long-lasting financial choices that positively impact their future.&lt;ref&gt;Lusardi, A., Clark, R. L., Fox, J., Grable, J., &amp; Taylor, E. (2010). The NEFE quarter century project: 25 years of research in financial education: Theme 1: Promising learning strategies, interventions, and delivery methods in financial literacy education.

They then pursue their individual path to financial wellbeing according to where they are in the life cycle and their readiness/willingness to change, as per the [[Transtheoretical Model]] of Behavior Change (TTM).  In addition, ongoing education, motivation and support are provided as part of the Financial Social Work package, thereby maximizing the likelihood of the optimal results.&lt;ref&gt;Ozmete, E., &amp; Hira, T. K. (2011). Conceptual analysis of behavioral theories: Application to financial behavior. European Journal of Social Sciences, 18(3), 386–404.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfsohn, R. (2012).

'''Gene transfer strategies''' for the potential medical management of [[osteoarthritis]] are under preliminary research to define [[pathology|pathological]] mechanisms and possible treatments for this chronic disease. Unlike pharmacological treatments which are administered [[Systemic administration|systemically]], [[gene therapy]] aims to establish sustained, synthesis of gene products and tissue rehabilitation within the joint.&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=29160173|pmc=5773261|year=2018|last1=Evans|first1=C. H|title=Gene Delivery to Joints by Intra-Articular Injection|journal=Human Gene Therapy|volume=29|issue=1|pages=2–14|last2=Ghivizzani|first2=S. C|last3=Robbins|first3=P. D|doi=10.1089/hum.2017.181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Passing from parents to children, [[genes]] are the building blocks of inheritance. They contain instructions for making [[proteins]]. If genes do not produce the right proteins in a correct way, a child can have a genetic disorder.
[[Gene therapy]] is a molecular method aiming to replace defective or absent genes, or to counteract the ones undergoing overexpression. For this purpose, three techniques may be utilized: gene isolation, manipulations, and transferring to target cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=C. Wayne McIlwraith David D. Frisbie|title=Gene Therapy: Future Therapies in Osteoarthritis|journal=Vet Clin North Am Equine Pract|date=Aug 2001|volume=17|issue=2|pages=233–243|pmid=15658173|last2=McIlwraith|first2=C. W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The most common form of gene therapy involves inserting a normal gene to replace an abnormal gene. Other approaches including repairing an abnormal gene and altering the degree to which a gene is turned on or off. Two basic methodologies are utilized to transfer vectors into target tissues; [[Ex vivo]] gene transfer and [[In-vivo]] gene transfer. One type of gene therapy in which the gene transfer takes place outside the patient's body is called ex vivo gene therapy. This method of gene therapy is more complicated but safer since it is possible to culture, test, and control the modified cells.

[[Osteoarthritis]] (OA) is a degenerative joint disease which is the western world's leading cause of pain and disability.&lt;ref name="3 evans gouz"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=CH Evans |author2=JN Gouze |author3=E Gouze |author4=PD Robbins |author5=SC Ghivizzani |title=Osteoarthritis gene therapy|journal=Gene Therapy|year=2004|pages=379–389|doi=10.1038/sj.gt.3302196|pmid=14724685 |volume=11|issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="8 sara" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Madry, H., Luyten, F.P., and Facchini, A|title=Biological aspects of early osteoarthritis|journal=Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy|year=2011|doi=10.1007/s00167-011-1705-8|volume=20|issue=3|pages=407–422|pmid=22009557}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by the progressive loss of normal structure and function of articular [[cartilage]], the smooth tissue covering the end of the moving bones.&lt;ref name="10 sasa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buckwalter, J.A., and Mankin, H.J.|title=Instructional Course Lectures, The American Academy of Ortopaedic Surgeons – Articular cartilage: Part II.Degeneration and osteoarthritis, repair, regeneration, and transplantation|journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am|year=1997|volume=79|issue=14|series=4|pages=612–632|doi=10.2106/JBJS.J.01935|pmid=22810408|first1=Esa|last2=Nevalainen|first2=Pasi|last3=Eskelinen|first3=Antti|last4=Huotari|first4=Kaisa|last5=Kalliovalkama|first5=Jarkko|last6=Moilanen|first6=Teemu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chronic disease not only affects the articular cartilage but the subchondral bone, the [[synovium]] and periarticular tissues are other candidates.&lt;ref name="3 evans gouz" /&gt; People with OA can experience severe pain and limited motion. OA is mostly the result of natural aging of the joint due to biochemical changes in the cartilage [[extracellular matrix]].&lt;ref name="8 sara" /&gt;&lt;ref name="11 sasa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=.

Osteoarthritis is caused by mechanical factors such as joint [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] and mechanical overloading of joints or joint-instability.&lt;ref name=evans/&gt;&lt;ref name="11 sasa" /&gt; Since the degeneration of cartilage is an irreversible phenomenon, it is incurable, costly and responds poorly to treatment.&lt;ref name="3 evans gouz" /&gt; Due to the prevalence of this disease, the repair and regeneration of articular cartilage has become a dominant area of research.&lt;ref name="10 sasa" /&gt; The growing number of the people suffering from osteoarthritis and the effectiveness of the current treatments attract a great deal of attention to genetic-based therapeutic methods to treat the progression of this chronic disease.

== Vectors for osteoarthritis gene delivery ==
Various [[vector (molecular biology)|vectors]] have been developed to carry the therapeutic genes to cells. There are two broad categories of gene delivery vectors: [[Viral vectors]], involving [[viruses]] and non-viral agents, such as [[polymers]] and [[liposomes]].&lt;ref name=evans/&gt;&lt;ref name="sarraf"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Antonios G. Mikos A. Saraf|title=Gene delivery strategies for cartilage tissue engineering|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|year=2006|pages=592–603|doi=10.1016/j.addr.2006.03.005|pmid=16766079|volume=58|issue=4|pmc=2702530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viral vectors ===
[[Viral vectors]] proved to be more successful in transfecting [[Cell (biology)|cells]] as their life cycles require them to transfer their own genes to the host cells with high efficiency. A virus infects the human by inserting its gene directly into his cells. This can be deadly, but the brilliant idea is to take advantage of this natural ability. The idea is to remove all the dangerous genes in the virus and inject the healthy human genes. So, viruses are inserting positive elements to the host cells while attacking them and they will be helpful rather than harmful.&lt;ref name="4nk evans"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christopher H. Evans|title=Gene Therapies for Osteoarthritis|journal=Current Rheumatology Reports|year=2004|volume=6|issue=1|pages=31–40|doi=10.1007/s11926-004-0081-5|pmid=14713400|first1=Christopher H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[viral vectors]] are 40% more efficient in transferring genes, they are not fully appreciated for in vivo gene delivery because of their further adverse effects. Primarily, viral vectors induce an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] response, which can cause minor side effects such as mild [[edema]] or serious ones like multisystem organ failure. It is also difficult to administer gene therapy repeatedly due to the immune system's enhanced response to viruses. Furthermore, viruses may spread out to other organs after [[intraarticular]] injection and this will be an important disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=N. Somia I.M. Verma|title=Gene Therapy — promises, problems and prospects|journal=Nature|volume=389|issue=6648|year=1997|pages=239–242|bibcode=1997Natur.389..239V|last2=Somia|first2=Nikunj|doi=10.1038/38410|pmid=9305836|first1=Inder M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, majority of problems associated with gene delivery using viral vectors solved by ex vivo gene delivery method. In Osteoarthritis gene therapy, ex vivo method makes it possible to transfect not only the cells of the synovial lining of joints but also articular [[chondrocytes]] and chondroprogenitor cells in cartilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Q.J. Jiang K. Gelse|title=Fibroblast-mediated delivery of growth factor complementary DNA into mouse joints induces chondrogenesis but avoids the disadvantages of direct viral gene transfer|journal=Arthritis Rheum|year=2001|pages=1943–1953|displayauthors=etal |doi=10.1002/1529-0131(200108)44:8&lt;1943::aid-art332&gt;3.0.co;2-z|volume=44|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-viral vectors ===
Non-viral methods involve complexing therapeutic [[DNA]] to various [[macromolecules]] including cationic lipids and [[liposomes]], [[polymers]], [[polyamines]] and [[polyethylenimine]], and [[nanoparticles]].&lt;ref name=evans/&gt; FuGene 6 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=G. Kaul H. Madry|title=Trippel, Enhanced repair of articular cartilage defects in vivo by transplanted chondrocytes overexpressing insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)|journal=Gene Therapy|year=2005|pages=1171–1179|displayauthors=etal |doi=10.1038/sj.gt.3302515|pmid=15815701|volume=12|issue=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modified cationic liposomes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=T.M.

Goomer |title=Nonviral in vivo Gene Therapy for tissue engineering of articular cartilage and tendon repair|journal=Clin. Orthop. Relat.

FuGene 6 is a non-liposomal lipid formulation, which has proved to be successful in transfecting a variety of cell lines. Liposomes have shown to be an appropriate candidate for gene delivery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verwaerde, C. Jacquet, C. Auriault, J. Sany, C. Jorgensen F. Apparailly|title=Adenovirus-mediated transfer of viral IL-10 gene inhibits murine collagen-induced arthritis|journal=Journal of Immunology|year=1998|pages=5213–5220}}&lt;/ref&gt; where cationic liposomes are made to facilitate the interaction with the cell membranes and nucleic acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J. Honiger |author2=D. Damotte |author3=A. Minty |author4=C. Fournier |author5=D. Fradelizi |author6=M. Boissier N. Bessis |title=Encapsulation in hollow fibres of xenogeneic cells engineered to secrete IL-4 or IL-13 ameliorates murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA)|journal=Clinical &amp; Experimental Immunology|year=1999|pages=376–382|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2249.1999.00959.x|pmid=10444273 |volume=117|issue=2 |pmc=1905333}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike viral vectors, non-viral ones avoid the risk of acquiring replication competence. They have the capacity to deliver a large amount of therapeutic genes repeatedly, and it is convenient to produce them on a large scale. The most important of all, they do not elicit immune responses in the host organism. In spite of having advantages, non-viral vectors have not yet replaced viral vectors due to relatively low efficiency and short-term [[transgene]] expression.&lt;ref name=sarraf /&gt;

Novel non-viral vectors for osteoarthritis gene delivery including polymeric vectors are still under investigations.

== Target cells in osteoarthritis gene therapy ==
Target cells in the OA therapy are autologous [[chondrocytes]], Chondroprogenitor cells, Cells within the synovial cavity,&lt;ref name=sarraf /&gt; and cells of adjacent tissues such as [[muscle]], [[tendons]], [[ligaments]], and [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]].
Development of cartilage function and structure may be achieved by: 
*Inhibiting inflammatory and [[catabolic]] pathways
*Stimulating [[anabolic]] pathways to rebuild the matrix 
*Impeding cell [[senescence]]
*Avoiding the pathological formation of [[osteophytes]] 
*Prevention of [[apoptosis]], and/or influencing several of these processes &lt;ref name="Hamburg"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Magali Cucchiarini |author2=Henning Madry |title=Magali Cucchiarini and Henning Madry|journal=Experimental Orthopaedics and Osteoarthritis Research, Saarland University Medical Center|series=Homburg/Saar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approaches influencing several of these processes simultaneously have also shown to be successful, like transferring the combination of inhibitors of catabolism pathways and activators of anabolic events ([[IGF-I]]/[[IL-1RA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haupt JL|title=Transduction of insulin-like growth factor-I and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein controls cartilage degradation in an osteoarthritic culture model|journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Research|year=2005|pages=118–126|displayauthors=etal |doi=10.1016/j.orthres.2004.06.020|pmid=15607883|volume=23|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as that of activators of anabolic and proliferative processes (FGF- 2/SOX9 or FGF-2/IGF-I).&lt;ref name=Hamburg /&gt;

== Gene defects leading to osteoarthritis ==
Osteoarthritis has a great degree of heritability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacGregor AJ|title=The genetic contribution to radiographic hip osteoarthritis in women: results of a classic twin study|journal=Arthritis Rheum|year=2000|pages=2410–2416|doi=10.1002/1529-0131(200011)43:11&lt;2410::aid-anr6&gt;3.0.co;2-e|volume=43|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of osteoarthritis caused by single gene mutation have better chance of treatment by gene therapy.&lt;ref name="3 evans gouz" /&gt;

[[Epidemiological]] studies have shown that a genetic component may be an important risk factor in OA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piercarlo Sarzi-Puttini|title=Osteoarthritis: An Overview of the Disease and Its Treatment Strategies|journal=Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism|year=2005|volume=35|issue=1|pages=1–10|displayauthors=etal |pmid=16084227|doi=10.1016/j.semarthrit.2005.01.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insulin-like growth factor I]] genes (IGF-1), [[Transforming growth factor]]β, [[cartilage oligomeric matrix protein]], [[bone morphogenetic protein]], and other anabolic gene candidates are among the candidate genes for OA.&lt;ref name=sarraf /&gt; Genetic changes in OA can lead to defects of a structural protein such as [[collagen]], or changes in the metabolism of bone and cartilage. OA is rarely considered as a simple disorder following [[Mendelian inheritance]] being predominantly a multifactorial disease.

However, in the field of OA gene therapy, researches has more focused on gene transfer as a delivery system for therapeutic gene products, rather counteracting genetic abnormalities or [[genetic polymorphism|polymorphisms]]. Genes, which contribute to protect and restore the matrix of articular cartilage, are attracting the most attention. These Genes are listed in '''Table 1'''. Among all candidates listed below, proteins that block the actions of interleukin-1 (IL-1) or that promote the synthesis of cartilage matrix molecules have received the most experimental scrutiny.&lt;ref name="4nk evans" /&gt;

== Interleukin-1 as a target in osteoarthritis ==
Researches suggest that among all potential mediators, a protein called [[Interleukin-1]] is by far the most potent cause of the pain, joint inflammation and loss of cartilage associated with osteoarthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cole AA Kuettner KE|title=Cartilage degeneration in different human joints|journal=Osteoarthritis Cartilage|date=Feb 2005|volume=13|issue=2|pages=93–103|doi=10.1016/j.joca.2004.11.006|pmid=15694570|first1=K|last2=Cole|first2=A}}&lt;/ref&gt; A therapeutic gene used to treat the arthritic joins produces a second protein, which naturally counteracts the effect of interleukin-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dinarello CA|title=Interleukin-1 family;The Cytokine Handbook|year=2003|publisher=Academic Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist]] (IL-1Ra), the natural agonist of IL-1, is a protein that binds non-productively to the cell surface of interleukin-1 receptor, therefore blocks the activities of IL-1 by preventing it from sending a signal to IL-1 receptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spurr NK, Cox S, Jeggo P, Sim RB Steinkasserer A|title=The human IL-1 receptor antagonist gene (IL1RN) maps to chromosome 2q14-q21, in the region of the IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta loci|journal=Genomics|date=July 1992|volume=13|issue=3|pages=654–657|doi=10.1016/0888-7543(92)90137-H|pmid=1386337|last2=Spurr|first2=N.

There are three main researches that prove the benefits of local IL-1Ra gene therapy in animal models of osteoarthritis [4]. Series of experiments on canines, rabbits, and horses demonstrate that local IL-1Ra gene therapy is safe and effective in animal models of OA, according to the fact that recombinant human IL-1Ra strongly protected the articular cartilage from degenerative changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fernandes JC, Martel-Pelletier J, Caron JP |title=Chondroprotective effect of intra-articular injections of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in experimental osteoarthritis: suppression of collagenase-1 expression|journal=Arthritis Rheum|year=1996|pages=1535–1544|displayauthors=etal |doi=10.1002/art.1780390914|volume=39|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tardif G, Martel-Pelletier J, Fernandes J |title=In vivo transfer of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene in osteoarthritic rabbit knee joints: prevention of osteoarthritis progression|journal=American Journal of Pathology|year=1999|pages=1159–1169|displayauthors=etal |doi=10.1016/s0002-9440(10)65368-0|pmid=10233854|volume=154|issue=4|pmc=1866546}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ghivizzani SC, Robbins PD, Frisbie DD |title=Treatment of experimental equine osteoarthritis by in vivo delivery of the equine interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene|journal=Gene Therapy|year=2002|pages=12–20|displayauthors=etal |doi=10.1038/sj.gt.3301608|pmid=11850718|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies for osteoarthritis gene therapy ==
In the context of OA, the most attractive intra- articular sites for gene transfer are the synovium and the articular cartilage. Most experimental progress has been made with gene transfer to a convenient intra-articular tissue, such as the synovium, a tissue amenable to genetic modification by a variety of vectors, using both in vivo and ex vivo protocols.

=== Gene transfer to synovium ===
The major purpose of gene delivery is to alter the lining of the joint in a way that enables them to serve as an endogenous source of therapeutic molecules ('''Table-1''') therapeutic molecules can diffuse and influence the metabolism of adjacent tissues such as cartilage. Genes may be delivered to synovium in animal models of RA and OA by direct, in vivo injection of vector or by indirect, ex vivo methods involving autologous synovial cells, skin [[fibroblasts]], or other cell types such as [[mesenchymal stem cells]].

The direct in vivo approach is intra-articular insertion of a vector to affect synovicytes. Vectors play crucial role in success of this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=C. H. |author2=Robbins, P. D. Evans|title=Gene therapy for arthritis|journal=Gene Therapeutics, J. A. Wolff, Edition|year=1994|pages=320–343|doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-6822-9_18|isbn=978-1-4684-6824-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of Different vectors for in vivo gene delivery to synovium is summarized in '''Table 2''':

{| border="1" cellpadding="2" align="center"
|+ '''Table 2- Performance of different vectors for in vivo gene delivery to synovium''' &lt;ref name="4nk evans" /&gt; 
|-
! style="background: #efefef;" | Vector
! colspan="2" style="background: #ffdead;" | Comment
|-
| Non-viral Vectors || Short-term and less efficient transfection; many inflammatory

|-
| [[Adeno-associated virus]] || Moderate levels of transduction of normal and inflamed synovium
|-
| [[Herpes simplex virus]]|| Highly efficient transduction; cytotoxic

|}

The indirect ex vivo approach involves harvest of synovium, isolation and culture of synoviocytes, in vitro transduction, and injection of engineered synovicytes into the joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=G Bandara|title=Intraarticular expression of biologically active interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein by ex vivo gene transfer|journal=Proc.

=== Gene transfer to cartilage ===
Contrary to the synoviocytes which are dividing cells and can be efficacy transduced in vivo using either liposomes or viral vectors, in vivo delivery of genes to chondrocytes is hindered by the dense extra cellular matrix that surrounds these cells. Chondrocytes are non- dividing cells, embedded in a network of [[collagens]] and [[proteoglycans]]; however researches suggest that genes can be transferred to chondrocytes within normal cartilage by intraarticular injection of liposomes containing [[sendai virus]] (HVJ- liposomes) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hashimoto H, Tomita N, Tomita T |title=In vivo direct gene transfer into articular cartilage by intra-articular injection mediated by HVJ (sendai) virus and liposomes|journal=Arthritis Rheum|year=1997|pages=901–906|displayauthors=etal |doi=10.1002/art.1780400518|volume=40|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adeno-associated virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz E|title=The adeno-associated virus vector for orthopaedic gene therapy|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|year=2000|pages=31–40|doi=10.1097/00003086-200010001-00005|volume=379}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Yoo U, Mandell I, Angele P |title=Chondroprogenitor cells and gene therapy|journal=Clin Orthop|year=2000|pages=164–170|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most efficient methods of gene transfer to cartilage have involved ex vivo strategies using chondrocytes or chondroprogenitor cells. Chondrocytes are genetically enhanced by transferring complementary DNA encoding [[IL-1RA]], [[IGF-1]], or matrix break down [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]] mentioned in '''Table 1'''. As discussed before, the transplanted cells could serve as an intra- articular source of therapeutic molecules.&lt;ref name="4nk evans" /&gt;

== Safety ==
One important issue related to human gene therapy is safety, particularly for the gene therapy of non-fatal diseases such as OA. The main concern is the high [[immunogenicity]] of certain viral vectors. Retroviral vectors integrate into the [[chromosomes]] of the cells they infect. There will be always a chance of integrating into a tumor suppressor gene or an [[oncogene]], leading to virulent transformation of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson WF|title=Human gene therapy|journal=Science|year=1992|volume=256|issue=5058|pages=808–813|doi=10.1126/science.1589762|pmid=1589762|first1=W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, gene transfer to humans is considered as a safe therapeutic method, despite recent events that have provided examples of random adverse events.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In physics, '''geometrothermodynamics (GTD)''' is a formalism developed in 2007 by Hernando Quevedo to describe the properties of [[thermodynamic]] systems in terms of concepts of differential geometry.&lt;ref name=quev07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quevedo | first=Hernando|year=2007|title=Geometrothermodynamics|journal=J. Math. Phys.|volume=48|pages=013506|arxiv=physics/0604164 |bibcode=2007JMP....48a3506Q|doi=10.1063/1.2409524}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Consider a  thermodynamic system in the framework of classical equilibrium thermodynamics. The states of thermodynamic equilibrium are considered as points of an abstract equilibrium space in which a Riemannian metric can be introduced in several ways. In particular, one can introduce [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] metrics like the [[Fisher information metric]], the [[Weinhold metric]], the [[Ruppeiner metric]] and others, whose components are calculated as the Hessian of a particular [[thermodynamic potential]]. 

Another possibility is to introduce metrics which are independent of the thermodynamic potential, a property which is shared by all thermodynamic systems in classical thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Callen|first=Herbert B.| title=Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics
|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|year=1985 | isbn=0-471-86256-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a change of thermodynamic potential is equivalent to a [[Legendre transformation]], and Legendre transformations do not act in the equilibrium space, it is necessary to introduce an auxiliary space to correctly handle the Legendre transformations. This is the so-called thermodynamic phase space. If the phase space is equipped with a Legendre invariant Riemannian metric, a smooth map can be introduced that induces a thermodynamic metric in the equilibrium manifold. The thermodynamic metric can then be used with different thermodynamic potentials without changing the geometric properties of the equilibrium manifold.  One expects the geometric properties of the equilibrium manifold to be related to the macroscopic physical properties. 

The details of this relation can be summarized in three main points:
#Curvature is a measure of the thermodynamical interaction.
#Curvature singularities correspond to curvature phase transitions. 
#Thermodynamic geodesics correspond to quasi-static processes.

==Geometric aspects==
{{complex|section|date=June 2018}}

The main ingredient of GTD is a (2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional manifold &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; 
with coordinates &lt;math&gt;Z^A=\{\Phi,E^a,I^a\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary thermodynamic potential, &lt;math&gt;E^a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a=1,2,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;, are the
extensive variables, and &lt;math&gt;I^a&lt;/math&gt; the intensive variables. It is also
possible to introduce in a canonical manner the fundamental
one-form &lt;math&gt;\Theta = d\Phi - \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b&lt;/math&gt; (summation over repeated indices) with &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ab}={\rm
diag}(+1,\ldots,+1)&lt;/math&gt;, which satisfies the condition &lt;math&gt;\Theta \wedge
(d\Theta)^n \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of thermodynamic
degrees of freedom of the system, and is invariant with respect to
Legendre transformations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Arnold|first=V.I.

|publisher=[[Springer Verlag]]|year=1989 | isbn=0-387-96890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\{Z^A\}\longrightarrow \{\widetilde{Z}^A\}=\{\tilde \Phi, \tilde E ^a, \tilde I ^ a\}\ ,\quad
\Phi = \tilde \Phi - \delta_{kl} \tilde E ^k \tilde I ^l ,\quad
E^i = - \tilde I ^{i}, \quad 
  E^j = \tilde E ^j,\quad   
 I^{i} = \tilde E ^i , \quad 
 I^j = \tilde I ^j \ ,
 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i\cup j&lt;/math&gt; is any disjoint decomposition of the set of indices &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;,
and &lt;math&gt;k,l= 1,\ldots,i&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, for &lt;math&gt;i=\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; we obtain
the total Legendre transformation and the identity, respectively.
It is also assumed that in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{T} &lt;/math&gt; 
there exists a metric &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; which is also
invariant with respect to Legendre transformations. The triad
&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{T},\Theta,G)&lt;/math&gt; defines a Riemannian [[contact manifold]] which is
called the thermodynamic phase space (phase manifold). The space of
thermodynamic equilibrium states (equilibrium manifold)  is an
n-dimensional [[Riemannian submanifold]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}\subset \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;
induced by a smooth map &lt;math&gt;\varphi:\mathcal{E}\rightarrow\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;,
i.e. &lt;math&gt;\varphi:\{E^a\} \mapsto \{\Phi,E^a,I^a\}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\Phi=\Phi(E^a)&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;I^a= I^a(E^a)&lt;/math&gt;,  such that &lt;math&gt; \varphi^*(\Theta)=\varphi^*(d\Phi
- \delta_{ab}I^{a}dE^{b})=0 &lt;/math&gt; holds, where &lt;math&gt;\varphi^*&lt;/math&gt; is the
pullback of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. The manifold &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is naturally equipped
with the Riemannian metric &lt;math&gt;g=\varphi^*(G)&lt;/math&gt;. The purpose of GTD is
to demonstrate that the geometric properties of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; are
related to the thermodynamic properties of a system with fundamental
thermodynamic equation &lt;math&gt;\Phi=\Phi(E^a)&lt;/math&gt;.
The condition of invariance with respect total Legendre transformations leads to the metrics

: &lt;math&gt;
G^I = (d\Phi- \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b)^2 + \Lambda\, (\xi_{ab} E^a I^b)\left( \delta_{cd} dE^c d I^d\right)\ ,\quad
\delta_{ab}={\rm diag}(1,\ldots,1)
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
G^{II} = (d\Phi- \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b)^2 + \Lambda\, (\xi_{ab} E^a I^b)\left( \eta_{cd} dE^c d I^d\right)\ ,\quad
\eta_{ab}={\rm diag}(-1,1,\ldots,1)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\xi_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant diagonal matrix that can be expressed in terms of &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\eta_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary Legendre invariant function of &lt;math&gt;Z^A&lt;/math&gt;. The metrics &lt;math&gt;G^I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^{II}&lt;/math&gt; have been used to describe thermodynamic systems with first and second order phase transitions, respectively. The most general metric which is invariant with respect to partial Legendre transformations is

: &lt;math&gt;
G^{III} = (d\Phi- \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b)^2 + \Lambda\, ( E_a I_a)^{2k+1} \left( dE^a d I^a\right)\ ,
\quad
 E_a= \delta_{ab} E^b \ , 
\quad I_a = \delta_{ab} I^b \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

The components of the corresponding metric for the equilibrium manifold &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal E} &lt;/math&gt; can be computed as

: &lt;math&gt;
g_{ab} = \frac{\partial Z^A}{\partial E^a}\frac{\partial Z^B}{\partial E^b} G_{AB}\ .
&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
GTD has been applied to describe laboratory systems like the ideal gas, van der Waals gas, the Ising model, etc., more exotic systems like black holes in different gravity theories,&lt;ref name=qstv11&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quevedo | first1=H.|last2=Sanchez | first2=A. |last3=Taj | first3=S.|last4=Vazquez | first4=A. |year=2011|title=Phase transitions in Geometrothermodynamics|journal=Gen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11604">'''GrubStreet, Inc.''' is a non-profit creative writing center located in the heart of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Through various workshops, seminars, events and programs, GrubStreet supports writers at all stages of development. According to GrubStreet's website, its mission is "to be an innovative, rigorous, and welcoming community for writers who together create their best work, find audience, and elevate the literary arts for all."&lt;ref name="whatIsGrubStreet"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grubstreet.org/index.php?id=2 | title=What Is Grub Street? | publisher=Grub Street | accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was founded, 53 instructors and 22 students have successfully published their books.&lt;ref name="boston.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/07/04/empowering_writers/ | title=Empowering writers | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=July 4, 2010 | accessdate=March 29, 2012 | author=Gardner, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those include [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestselling]] author [[Jenna Blum]]. GrubStreet is considered to be center of literary life in Boston.&lt;ref name="phoenix"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/other_stories/multi-page/documents/05016163.asp | title=Putting in a good word | work=[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]] | date=October 13, 2005 | accessdate=March 29, 2012 | author=Miliard, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

GrubStreet was founded in 1997 in [[Boston]], Massachusetts. Founder [[Eve Bridburg]] opened GrubStreet as a place for anyone interested in creative writing to gain instruction and guidance. At first, GrubStreet only offered fiction workshops, had two instructors (Bridburg one of them) and eight students. GrubStreet demonstrated early success when, a year later in 1998, [[HarperCollins]] published student [[Jamie Katz]]'s mystery novel ''Dead Low Tide''. By 2001 GrubStreet had nearly 100 students, more than a dozen instructors, and courses in poetry, screenwriting, nonfiction, and playwriting. GrubStreet became a fully accredited nonprofit in 2002.&lt;ref name="phoenix"/&gt;

Since then, GrubStreet has taught over 10,000 Boston-area writers of all levels and has put over $1 million into the pockets of writers. It has a fully staffed office overlooking [[Boston Common]] in downtown Boston and operates on an annual budget of $800,000, funded by grants, donations, and membership dues. New books affiliated with GrubStreet include: [[Jenna Blum]]'s ''The Stormchasers''; [[Jonathan Papernick]]'s ''There is No Other''; [[Lynne Reeves Griffin|Lynne Griffin]]'s ''Sea Escape''; [[Michelle Hoover]]'s "The Quickening;" [[Marianne Leone]]'s ''Knowing Jesse''; [[Bruce Machart]]'s ''The Wake of Forgiveness''; [[Randy Susan Meyers]]'s ''The Murderer's Daughters'' and ''The Comfort Of Lies''; [[Amy MacKinnon]]'s ''Tethered''; [[Lisa Genova]]'s ''[[Still Alice]]''; and [[Daphne Kalotay]]'s ''Russian Winter'', Nichole Bernier's ''The Unfinished Work of Elizabeth D'', Julie Wu's forthcoming ''The Third Son'' and [[Henriette Power Lazaridis]]' forthcoming ''Clean Monday''.&lt;ref name="boston.com"/&gt;

==Workshops==

GrubStreet does not offer any writing degrees. Rather, it provides writing instruction that is comparable to an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] program. The pedagogy is, in effect, to offer classes in both the "muse" (inspiration) and "marketplace" (how to get published). The writing workshops --- courses in poetry, fiction, essay, narrative nonfiction, as well as screen and playwriting --- are run like traditional writing workshops, with weekly group critiques of student work, led by the instructor. Classes in the "Writing Life" (time management, blogging, writer's block, etc.) and publishing and promotion (such as classes on submitting to agents or planning book tours) help writers address the marketplace aspects of their writing careers. Courses can be one-night seminars, weekend workshops, or 6- or 10-week-long workshops.

==Membership==

GrubStreet classes are open to all, however the membership provides discounts and benefits. Members, called “Grubbies,” are given discounts on courses, as well as benefit from discounts at all Boston [[independent bookstore]]s. Further benefits include discounts on theatre tickets, magazine subscriptions, free access to the GrubStreet space and library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grubstreet.org/index.php?id=34 | title=join grub street | publisher=Grub Street | accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muse &amp; the Marketplace==

GrubStreet’s signature event, The Muse and the Marketplace, is a three-day, weekend-long writer’s symposium. It is known for attracting acclaimed authors, agents, and editors to its programs.  Hugely successful, the [[Boston Globe]] calls it the “highlight of the Boston literary scene”.&lt;ref name="bostonGlobe2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/05/04/novices_peek_at_literary_world/ | title=Novices peek at literary world | work=The Boston Globe | date=May 4, 2008 | accessdate=March 29, 2012 | author=McKenna, Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is attended by over 900 writers and publishing professionals.&lt;ref name="boston.com"/&gt;

Over the three days, prominent authors lead craft seminars, while agents, editors, and publicists lead sessions on the business aspects of writing. There is also a Manuscript Mart, where writers meet one-on-one with an agent or editor for personalized feedback.  Various seminars, lectures, and panels about creative writing and the business of writing are held.

Many bestselling authors and renowned agents and editors have been involved with GrubStreet’s Muse and the Marketplace. In 2010, [[Chuck Palahniuk]] was the keynote speaker. Other people of note include: [[Steve Almond]], Jessica Shattuck, Jeanne Leiby, Richard Abate, Elyse Cheney, Lynne Barrett, Martha Southgate, Christina Thompson, Jenni Ferrari-Alder, Lisa Grubka, [[Maud Casey]], [[Ben Percy]], Miriam Altshuler, PJ Mark, Vestal McIntyre, Michael Downing, Joseph Olsham, Elizabeth Evans, Tim Bartlett, Susan Tiberghien, Lauren Grodstein, Leslea Newman, Reagan Arthur, Regina Brooks, Joanna Volpe, [[Ann Hood]], Allison Winn Scotch, Christine Pride, Stephany Evans, Mitchell Waters, [[Jennifer 8. Lee]], [[Ethan Gilsdorf]], Ladette Randolph, Elizabeth Weed, Rebecca Oliver, Thomas Mallon, [[Anita Shreve]], Pamela Dorman, Julie Barer, Sorche Fairbank, Nathaniel Rich, [[Pablo Medina]], Janna Malamud Smith, Jofie Ferrari-Alder, Denise Shannon, [[Elizabeth Strout]], Michelle Hoover, Janet Silver, Amy Einhorn, [[Bret Anthony Johnston]], Donovan Campbell, Katherine Fausset, Jill Kneerim, [[Elinor Lipman]], Randy Susan Meyers, [[Jenna Blum]], [[Hallie Ephron]], Lynne Griffin, [[Mameve Medwed]], and Katharine Sands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grubstreet.org/index.php?id=173 | title=The Muse &amp; the Marketplace 2012 | publisher=Grub Street | accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=March 2012}}

==Programs==

===Memoir Project===

Working with the city of Boston, GrubStreet founded the Memoir Project in 2006, which involves older residents in 10 Boston neighborhoods, including [[Nantucket]], to write. The joint effort aims at teaching and encouraging the elderly to use writing as a creative outlet as well as document and preserve their stories for future generations.&lt;ref name="boston.com" /&gt; Neighborhoods involved include: Chinatown, Charlestown, East Boston, Mattapan, Roxbury, [[South Boston]], and the [[North End, Boston|North End]]. Two anthologies of collected works have been published: ''Born Before Plastic'' and “My Legacy Is Simply This: Stories From Boston’s Most Endearing Neighborhoods.” Another anthology is to be published.&lt;ref name="boston.com" /&gt;

===Young Adult Writing Program (YAWP)===

GrubStreet’s Young Adult Writing Program (YAWP) offers free writing workshops for all Boston-area teenagers. The program consists of monthly, 4-hour workshops during a Saturday at the downtown offices. Workshops range from poetry and fiction to graphic novel and are taught by Grub Street instructors.&lt;ref name="grubStreetYAWP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grubstreet.org/index.php?id=22 | title=Young Adult Writers Program | publisher=Grub Street | accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; YAWP has been recognized as the hub for creative writing teenagers in the Boston area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ethangilsdorf.com/storage/portrait%20of%20young%20bards.pdf | title=Portrait of the young bards | work=The Boston Globe | date=December 24, 2006 | accessdate=March 29, 2012 | author=Junge, Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summer Teen Fellowship===

GrubStreet runs the YAWP Teen Writing Fellowship, an intensive three-week creative writing program during the summer. Accepted teens are immersed in the writers’ life of craft and publishing: they work with published authors, meet with agents and editors, and receive a stipend for their commitment. GrubStreet aims to mimic writers’ residencies, thus the YAWP Fellowship is by application only. About 20 students are accepted each summer.&lt;ref name="grubStreetYAWP" /&gt;

==National Book Prize==

The GrubStreet Book Prize is awarded three times a year to a writer publishing his/her second or beyond.  As the goal of the prize is to bring writers to Boston, only writers whose primary residence is not Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, or Rhode Island are eligible. Though merit is the most important criterion, authors publishing with small presses, writers of short stories, and writers of color are encouraged to apply. 
Winners of the Book Prize each receive $1000, as well as a book party at GrubStreet’s downtown location and co-sponsored by an independent bookstore. Winners will also lead a seminar of his or her choice, with accommodations, travel, and board provided for by GrubStreet. Fiction and non-fiction winners are invited as guest authors to the next Muse and the Marketplace.&lt;ref name="grubStreetYAWP" /&gt;

'''''Integral City: Evolutionary Intelligences for the Human Hive''''' (2008) is a book by Marilyn Hamilton. It posits a concept called the "Integral City", which is a [[city]] as a living human system. It is architecture and city planning based on [[Integral Theory]].

Hamilton's book came out of her dissertation ''The Berkana Community of Conversations'' (Hamilton, 1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dissertation.com/book.php?method=ISBN&amp;book=1581123302 |title=The Berkana Community of Conversations |publisher=dissertation.com |author=Marilyn Hamilton |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other published articles and conference papers by Hamilton.

The '''International Association for the Study of the Commons''' ('''IASC''') was founded in 1989 as ''The International Association for the Study of Common Property'' (IASCP). It is a non-for-profit organization that sees as its mission to further the understanding of institutions for the management of resources that are or could be held or used collectively as a [[commons]] by communities in developing and industrialized countries.

According to its vision statement, the goals of the association are:
* to encourage exchange of knowledge on the commons among diverse disciplines, areas, and resource types
* to foster mutual exchange of scholarship and practical experience
* to promote appropriate institutional design

== ''International Journal of the Commons'' ==

IASC publishes the ''International Journal of the Commons'', "an interdisciplinary peer-reviewed open-access journal ... dedicated to furthering the understanding of institutions for use and management of resources that are (or could be) enjoyed collectively."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecommonsjournal.org/index.php/ijc/about/editorialPolicies#focusAndScope "Editorial Policies,"] ''International Journal of the Commons''. Accessed: January 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal's [[editor-in-chief|editors-in-chief]] are Frank van Laerhoven ([[Utrecht University]]) and Michael Schoon ([[Arizona State University]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecommonsjournal.org/index.php/ijc/about/editorialTeam "Editorial Team,"] ''International Journal of the Commons''. Accessed: January 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conferences ==

The association organizes biennial [http://www.iasc-commons.org/conferences/global global conferences] as well as regional conferences. In 2012, it also organized the first [http://biogov.uclouvain.be/iasc/ First Thematic Conference on the Knowledge Commons].

'''Johnnie Garry''' was an entertainment director, producer, historian, nightclub manager, and road manager for [[Sarah Vaughan]] and [[Mary Lou Williams]].  He was the stage manager at the New York jazz club [[Birdland (New York jazz club)|Birdland]] in the 1960s.  He also worked as a stagehand, and as production coordinator and historian for [[Jazzmobile]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzicons.com/ji2_vaughan.html|title=Jazz Icons: Sarah Vaughan DVD|website=Jazzicons.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harlemonestop.com/news/522/johnnie-garry-mr-jazzmobile-october-31-1924-march-13-2018|title=JOHNNIE GARRY - 'MR. JAZZMOBILE' October 31, 1924 – March 13, 2018|website=Harleminestop.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Early life ==
Garry was born in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] in 1924.  He was an only child.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.harlemonestop.com/news/522/johnnie-garry-mr-jazzmobile-october-31-1924-march-13-2018|title=JOHNNIE GARRY {{!}} 'MR. JAZZMOBILE' October 31, 1924 – March 13, 2018|work=Harlem One Stop|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1928, his family moved to [[Harlem]], where they lived near the [[Apollo Theater]] on 127th Street.&lt;ref name=JazzMuseum&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzmuseuminharlem.org/oldsite/archive.php?id=346|title=The Jazz Museum in Harlem|website=www.jazzmuseuminharlem.org|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Garry saw his first jazz show at the Apollo; it featured [[Don Redman|Don Redman and his orchestra]].  He was unable to finish high school because he needed to support his family, so he took a job in the [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]].&lt;ref name=JazzMuseum/&gt;

== Career ==
Garry's career as a stagehand began at [[Cafe Society]] in [[Greenwich Village]].  Garry's neighbor, [[Josh White]], recommended him to [[Barney Josephson]], Cafe Society's founder and owner. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Josephson employed him as a stagehand, and soon promoted him into the management side of the business, giving him the opportunity to learn about running a night club.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This opened new doors for Garry.  He met the road manager for pianist [[Mary Lou Williams]], worked as a stagehand for artists including  [[Lena Horne]], [[Billie Holiday]], and [[Eddie Heywood]], and worked on Sarah Vaughan's management team for fifteen years, from 1945 to 1960.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.allaboutjazz.com/this-week-at-the-jazz-museum-nov-27-30.php|title=Jazz news: This Week at the Jazz Museum Nov 27–30|last=|first=|date=2007-11-26|website=All About Jazz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Garry began working at the jazz club [[Birdland (New York jazz club)|Birdland]] and rose to the position of club manager.  He was the first African-American manager of a major downtown New York City night club.  During the 1960s, Garry also worked at Club Sahara, another New York City jazz club.  He remained at Birdland until 1977.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1977, Garry was hired to work for [[Jazzmobile]] by [[Billy Taylor]].  He stayed at Jazzmobile until 2012, working as production coordinator, technical director, and historian.  While at Jazzmobile, Garry's credits included production of the Philip Morris Super (Jazz) Band on Tour, an international touring festival, and Jazzmobile's free outdoor summer mobile concert series, held throughout the [[Boroughs of New York City|five boroughs of New York City]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Garry worked as booking agent and road manager for the Bill Lockett Music Festivals and Jazz Cruises, and as stage manager for the Jazz Foundation of America's gala concerts.

During his career, Garry worked with many jazz artists, including [[Billy Taylor]], [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]], [[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]], [[B.B. King]], [[Jimmy Heath]], [[Clark Terry]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Wycliffe Gordon]], [[Carmen McRae]], [[Wynton Marsalis]], [[James Brown]], [[Houston Person]], [[Lou Donaldson]], [[Jimmy Heath]], [[Roy Hargrove]], [[Dianne Reeves]], [[Solomon Hicks]], [[Randy Weston]], [[Christian Sands]], [[Frank Foster (musician)|Frank Foster]], [[Charenee Wade]], [[Bobby Sanabria]], [[Antoinette Montague]], [[Monty Alexander]], [[T.

'''Land systems''' constitute the terrestrial component of the Earth system and encompass all processes and activities related to the human use of land, including socioeconomic, technological and organizational investments and arrangements, as well as the benefits gained from land and the unintended social and ecological outcomes of societal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verburg|first=Peter H|last2=Erb|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Mertz|first3=Ole|last4=Espindola|first4=Giovana|date=2013-10-01|title=Land System Science: between global challenges and local realities|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343513000936|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|series=Human settlements and industrial systems|volume=5|issue=5|pages=433–437|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2013.08.001|pmc=4018982|pmid=24851141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes  in land systems have large consequences for the local environment and human well-being and are at the same time pervasive factors of global environmental change. Land provides vital resources to society, such as food, fuel, fibres and many other [[ecosystem services]] that support production functions, regulate risks of natural hazards, or provide cultural and spiritual services.  By using the land, society alters and modifies the quantity and quality of the provision of these services.

Land system changes are the direct result of human decision making at multiple scales ranging from local land owners decisions to national scale land use planning and global trade agreements. The aggregate impact of many local land system changes has far reaching consequences for the Earth System, that feedback on ecosystem services, human well-being and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crossman|first=Neville D|last2=Bryan|first2=Brett A|last3=de Groot|first3=Rudolf S|last4=Lin|first4=Yu-Pin|last5=Minang|first5=Peter A|date=2013-10-01|title=Land science contributions to ecosystem services|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343513000729|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|series=Human settlements and industrial systems|volume=5|issue=5|pages=509–514|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2013.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, land system change is both a cause and consequence of socio-ecological processes.

The Global Land Programme (GLP) of [[Future Earth]] is an interdisciplinary community of science and practice fostering the study of land systems and the co-design of solutions for global sustainability.

The first leaf sensor was developed by LeafSens, an Israeli company granted a [[US patent]] for a mechanical leaf thickness sensing device in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference  |number=6185833 |y=2001 |m=02 |d=13 |inventor=Bravado, B.A., Sharon, Y., Seligmann, R. |title=Leaf thickness sensing device }}&lt;/ref&gt; LeafSen has made strides incorporating their leaf sensory technology into citrus orchards in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cohen, D. |title=Fruit Drinking |journal=New Scientist |issue=2290 |year=2001| url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17022903.700-fruitful-drinking.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A solid state smart leaf sensor technology was developed by the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] for [[NASA]] in 2007.  It was designed to help monitor and control [[farm water|agricultural water]] demand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2007/244.html&lt;/ref&gt; AgriHouse received a [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) STTR grant in conjunction with the University of Colorado to further develop the solid state leaf sensor technology for precision irrigation control in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AgriHouse Inc.

==Precision monitoring==

===Water deficit stress measurements===
[[Image:SG-1000 rev5.jpg|frame|right| AgriHouse Smart Leaf Sensor (SG-1000)]]
A Phase I research grant from the National Science Foundation in 2007 showed that the leaf sensor technology has the potential to save between 30% and 50% of irrigation water by reducing irrigation from once every 24 hours to about every 2 to 2.5 days by sensing impending water deficit stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Turning A New Leaf |publisher=National Science Foundation |date=June 7, 2007 | url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/newsletter/jul_07/NSF_Current_July_2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leaf sensor technology developed by AgriHouse indicates water deficit stress by measuring the [[turgor pressure]] of a leaf, which decreases dramatically at the onset of leaf dehydration. Early detection of impending water deficit stress in plants can be used as an input parameter for precision irrigation control by allowing plants to communicate water requirements directly to humans and/or electronic interfaces.  For example, a base system utilizing the wirelessly transmitted information of several sensors appropriately distributed over various sectors of a round field irrigated by a center-pivot irrigation system could tell the irrigation lever exactly when and what field sector needs to be irrigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones, W. |title=New Device Lets Plants Talk: Smart sensors let crops text-message growers for more water |year=2009 |journal=IEEE Spectrum |url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/may09/9029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M.

Walton |title=New Leaf Sensor Alerts When Plants Are Thirsty |year=2010|journal=National Science Foundation |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/science_nation/leafsensor.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irrigation control===
In a 2008 USDA sponsored field study AgriHouse's SG-1000 Leaf Sensor attached to dry beans demonstrated a 25% savings of irrigation water and pumping cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= AgriHouse awarded exclusive licensing for leaf sensor technology |publisher=Northern Colorado Business Report |date=January 12, 2010 |url=http://ncbr.com/article.asp?id=103724}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado granted AgriHouse Inc an exclusive license of its patented leaf sensor technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= AgriHouse Inc.

Precision irrigation monitoring using the SG-1000 leaf sensor and commercial data loggers for irrigation control has been achieved in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Sensors Enable Farmers to Text Messages to Farmers |publisher= NASA Spinoff Publication |date=January 2012|url=http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2012/ee_2.html/articles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have found a direct correlation between leaf thickness and Relative Water Content (RWC) of plant leaves using the SG-1000 Leaf Sensor under field conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Irrigation control of cowpea plants using the measurement of leaf thickness under greenhouse conditions  |publisher= Irrigation Science , Volume 30, Issue 4, pp 247-257|date=July 2012|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00271-011-0268-2/articles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water and Energy Conservation===
The agriculture sustainability benefits of water and energy savings have been established using the SG-1000 leaf sensor under field conditions and in greenhouses. Plant science researchers and agronomists have utilized the SG-1000 Leaf Sensor for studying the relationship between water content and leaf cell turgidity potential and leaf thickness. Plant leaf characteristics including water potential and osmotic water potential relationships have been studied with the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Leaf thickness and turgor pressure in bean during plant desiccation |journal= Scientia Horticulturae |volume =184| pages= 55–62 |date=5 March 2015|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304423814006980/articles |doi=10.1016/j.scienta.2014.12.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4037">'''Leslie John Green''' is a Canadian scholar in the [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] [[philosophy of law]], or jurisprudence as it is often called by academic lawyers.  He is Professor of the Philosophy of Law and Fellow of [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford University]], and Professor of Law and Distinguished Faculty Fellow at [[Queen's University, Kingston]].&lt;ref&gt;http://law.queensu.ca/faculty-research/faculty-directory/green&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

Born in [[Bridge of Weir]], [[Renfrewshire]], [[Scotland]], and educated at [[Queen's University]], Canada, and at [[Nuffield College, Oxford]], he completed his dissertation—which culminated in a book, ''The Authority of the State''—under professors [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and later [[Joseph Raz]].  Like Raz, he has been an expositor and defender of the tradition of [[legal positivism]] and wrote the introduction and new supplementary materials for the third edition of [[H.L.A. Hart]]'s classic work ''The Concept of Law.''

In 2006, Green was elected to the Professorship of Philosophy of Law at [[Oxford University]], which includes a Fellowship at [[Balliol College]].  The Professorship, a new statutory chair, was created upon the retirement of Joseph Raz from his personal Chair, also at Balliol. It is one of just two statutory professorships in [[jurisprudence]] at Oxford, the other being held by [[John Gardner (law)|John Gardner]]. In 2010, the distinguished lawyer, Philip Gordon, endowed the Balliol fellowship, and Green became the first Pauline and Max Gordon Fellow at Balliol.  At the same time, Green took up a part-time appointment as Professor and Distinguished University Fellow in the Philosophy of Law at Queen's University. Green is also an Adjunct Professor at [[McMaster University]].

Prior to this, Green taught for most of his career at [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] of [[York University]], in Toronto. He has also taught at [[Lincoln College, Oxford]], at [[Boalt Hall]] Law School at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]; at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], and was for several years a Regular Visiting Professor at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] law school. He has been a visiting fellow at [[Columbia University]]'s Center for Law and Philosophy, and a Hauser Global Faculty member at [[New York University School of Law]].

He is founding co-editor (with [[Brian Leiter]]) of ''Oxford Studies in Philosophy of Law''.

'''Lister's tubercle''' or '''dorsal tubercle of radius''' is a bony prominence located at the distal end of the [[radius (bone)|radius]], palpable on the [[dorsum (anatomy)#human anatomy|dorsum]] of the [[wrist]].

==Function==
Lister's [[Tubercle (anatomy)|tubercle]] serves as a pulley for the tendon of [[extensor pollicis longus]], which wraps around the medial side and takes a 45 degree turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/listers_tubercle|title=Wheeless Online|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]], '''meaning-making''' is the process of how people [[Construals|construe]], [[Understanding|understand]], or make sense of life events, relationships, and the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ignelzi|2000|p=5}}: "Meaning-making, the process of how individuals make sense of knowledge, experience, relationships, and the self, must be considered in designing college curricular environments supportive of learning and development." {{harvnb|Gillies|Neimeyer|Milman|2014|p=208}}: Through meaning-making, people are "retaining, reaffirming, revising, or replacing elements of their orienting system to develop more nuanced, complex and useful systems".&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is widely used in [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]] approaches to [[counseling psychology]] and [[psychotherapy]],&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Kegan|1980}}; {{harvnb|Kegan|1982}}; {{harvnb|Carlsen|1988}}; {{harvnb|Dorpat|Miller|1992}}; {{harvnb|Drath|Palus|1994}}; {{harvnb|Rosen|Kuehlwein|1996}}; {{harvnb|Basseches|1997}}; {{harvnb|Neimeyer|Raskin|2000}}; {{harvnb|Mackay|2003}}; {{harvnb|Neimeyer|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially during [[Grief|bereavement]] in which people attribute some sort of meaning to an experienced [[death]] or loss.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Epting|Neimeyer|1984}}; {{harvnb|Attig|1996}}; {{harvnb|Doka|Davidson|1998}}; {{harvnb|Neimeyer|2001}}; {{harvnb|Kalayjian|Eugene|2010}}; {{harvnb|Dyregrov|Dieserud|Hjelmeland|Straiton|2011}}; {{harvnb|Steffen|Coyle|2011}}; {{harvnb|Neimeyer|2012}}; {{harvnb|Gillies|Neimeyer|Milman|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used in [[educational psychology]].&lt;ref name="edu-refs"&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Postman|Weingartner|1969}}; {{harvnb|Novak|1993}}; {{harvnb|Merriam|Heuer|1996}}; {{harvnb|Rehm|1999}}; {{harvnb|Ignelzi|2000}}; {{harvnb|Kunnen|Bosma|2000}}; {{harvnb|Mortimer|Scott|2003}}; {{harvnb|Wickman|2006}}; {{harvnb|Scott|Mortimer|Aguiar|2006}}; {{harvnb|Nash|Murray|2010}}; {{harvnb|Baxter Magolda|King|2012}}; {{harvnb|Fantozzi|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a broader sense, meaning-making is the main research object of [[semiotics]], [[biosemiotics]], and other fields.&lt;ref name="Thibault"/&gt; '''Social meaning-making'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the main research object of [[social semiotics]] and related disciplines.&lt;ref name="Thibault"&gt;{{harvnb|Thibault|2003|p=41}}: "...&amp;nbsp;the description of a community's communicative practices cannot adequately be accomplished within the confines of any single discipline in the human and social sciences. Such an enterprise is necessarily a transdisciplinary one, drawing on the insights of sociology, ethnology, linguistics, anthropology, social psychology, and so on, in order to develop a unified conceptual framework for talking about social meaning-making (Gumperz 1992)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Viktor Frankl2.jpg|thumb|[[Viktor Frankl]], author of ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'']]
[[Psychiatrist]] and [[holocaust]] survivor [[Viktor Frankl]], founder of [[logotherapy]] in the 1940s, posited in his 1946 book ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'' that the primary motivation of a person is to discover meaning in life.&lt;ref name="Frankl"&gt;{{harvnb|Frankl|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frankl insisted that meaning can be discovered under all circumstances, even in the most miserable experiences of loss and tragedy. He said that people could discover meaning through doing a deed, experiencing a value, and experiencing suffering. Although Frankl did not use the term "meaning-making", his emphasis on the making of meaning influenced later psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;A [//scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author%3A%22V+Frankl%22 Google Scholar search for citations of Frankl's work] shows that ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'' is cited by some of the most influential psychologists and psychotherapists of the 20th century; it is cited in [[Aaron T. Beck]]'s ''Cognitive Therapy of Depression''; [[Albert Ellis]]'s ''New Guide to Rational Living''; [[Richard S. Lazarus]] and Susan Folkman's ''Stress, Appraisal, and Coping''; [[Carl Rogers]]'s ''Freedom to Learn''; and thousands of other texts.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neil Postman]] and Charles Weingartner, both of whom were educational critics and promoters of [[inquiry education]], published a chapter called "Meaning Making" in their 1969 book ''Teaching as a Subversive Activity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postman|Weingartner|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this chapter, they described why they preferred the term "meaning making" to any other metaphors for teaching and learning:

{{Quote|text=In the light of all this, perhaps you will understand why we prefer the metaphor "meaning making" to most of the metaphors of the mind that are operative in the schools. It is, to begin with, much less static than the others. It stresses a process view of minding, including the fact that "minding" is undergoing constant change. "Meaning making" also forces us to focus on the individuality and the uniqueness of the meaning ''maker'' (the ''minder''). In most of the other metaphors there is an assumption of "sameness" in all learners. The "garden" to be cultivated, the darkness to be lighted, the foundation to be built upon, the clay to be molded—there is always the implication that all learning will occur in the same way. The flowers will be the same color, the light will reveal the same room, the clay will take the same shape, and so on. Moreover, such metaphors imply boundaries, a limit to learning. How many flowers can a garden hold? How much water can a bucket take? What happens to the learner after his mind has been molded? How large can a building be, even if constructed on a solid foundation? The "meaning maker" has no such limitation. There is no end to his educative process. He continues to create new meanings... |author=[[Neil Postman]] and Charles Weingartner |source="Meaning Making"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postman|Weingartner|1969|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the end of the 1970s, the term "meaning-making" was used with increasing frequency,&lt;ref&gt;As can be seen in a [//books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=meaning-making&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2020&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3 Google Ngram of the term "meaning-making"] in [[Google Ngram Viewer]], usage of the term "meaning-making" in the [[Google Books]] database jumps just before 1980 and increases thereafter.&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist learning theory]] which posits that knowledge is something that is actively created by people as they experience new things and integrate new information with their current knowledge.&lt;ref name="edu-refs"/&gt; [[Developmental psychologist]] [[Robert Kegan]] used the term "meaning-making" as a key concept in several widely cited texts on counseling and human development published in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Kegan"&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Kegan|1980}}; {{harvnb|Kegan|1982}}; {{harvnb|Fantozzi|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kegan wrote: "''Human'' being is ''meaning making''. For the human, what ''evolving'' amounts to is ''the evolving of systems of meaning''; the business of organisms is to organize, as [[William G. Perry|Perry]] (1970) says."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kegan|1980|p=374}}; Kegan was referencing {{harvnb|Perry|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "meaning-making" has also been used by psychologists influenced by [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]]'s [[personal construct theory]].&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Epting|Neimeyer|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the meaning-making literature published in 2010, psychologist Crystal L. Park noted that there was a rich body of theory on meaning-making, but [[empirical research]] had not kept pace with theory development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Park|2010|pp=290–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the first Congress on the Construction of Personal Meaning&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Medlock|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held as part of the eighth Biennial International Meaning Conference convened by the International Network on Personal Meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=First Congress on the Construction of Personal Meaning: Exploring What Makes Life Worth Living |url=http://meaning.ca/conference/past-conferences/meaning-conference-2014/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407195317/http://meaning.ca/conference/past-conferences/meaning-conference-2014/ |website=meaning.ca |archivedate=2016-04-07 |accessdate=2016-04-07 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning as meaning-making==
The term ''meaning-making'' has been used in constructivist [[educational psychology]] to refer to the personal [[epistemology]] that people create to help them to make sense of the influences, relationships and sources of knowledge in their world.&lt;ref name="edu-refs"/&gt;

For example, psychologist [[Robert Kegan]] developed a theoretical framework that posited [[Robert Kegan#The Evolving Self|five levels of meaning-making]]; each level describes a more advanced way of understanding experiences, and people may come to master each level as they develop psychologically.&lt;ref name="Kegan"/&gt; Similarly, according to the [[transformative learning]] theory of sociologist and educator [[Jack Mezirow]], adults interpret the meaning of their experiences through a lens of deeply held assumptions.&lt;ref name="Mezirow"&gt;{{harvnb|Mezirow|2009}}; {{harvnb|Park|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they experience something that contradicts or challenges their way of negotiating the world they have to go through the transformative process of evaluating their assumptions and processes of making meaning. Experiences that force individuals to engage in this critical self-reflection, or what Mezirow called "disorienting dilemmas",&lt;ref name="Mezirow"/&gt; can be events such as loss, trauma, stressful life transitions or other interruptions.

==In bereavement==
With the experience of a [[death]], people often have to create new meaning of their loss. Interventions that promote meaning-making may be beneficial to grievers, as some interventions have been found to improve both [[mental health]] and physical health.&lt;ref name="Mackay"&gt;{{harvnb|Mackay|Bluck|2010|p=720}}: "In their study of bereaved parents, Murphy et al. (2003) showed that finding meaning was related to lower mental distress, higher marital satisfaction, and better physical health. Similar links to better adjustment have been found in other samples of bereaved parents (Keesee et al., 2008) and adults who lost loved ones through violent means (i.e., accidents, homicide, and suicide; Currier, Holland, &amp; Neimeyer, 2006)."&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to some researchers, "for certain individuals from challenging backgrounds, efforts after meaning might not be psychologically healthy" when those efforts are "more similar to rumination than to resolution" of problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sales|Merrill|Fivush|2013|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers report that meaning-making can help people feel less distressed, and allows people to become more resilient in the face of loss.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Calhoun|Tedeschi|2006}}; {{harvnb|Davis|Harasymchuk|Wohl|2012}}; {{harvnb|Webster|Deng|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the converse, failing to attribute meaning to death leads to more long-term distress for some people.&lt;ref name="Davis 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|Nolen-Hoeksema|Larson|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various strategies people can utilize for meaning-making; many of them are summarized in the book ''Techniques of Grief Therapy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neimeyer|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study developed a "Meaning of Loss Codebook" which clusters common meaning-making strategies into 30 categories.&lt;ref name="Gillies"&gt;{{harvnb|Gillies|Neimeyer|Milman|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst these meaning-making strategies, the most frequently used categories include: personal growth, family bonds, spirituality, valuing life, negative affect, impermanence, [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] changes, [[compassion]], and release from suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillies|Neimeyer|Milman|2014|pp=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family bonds===
Individuals using existing [[Human bonding|family bonds]] for meaning-making have a "change in outlook and/or behavior towards family members".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillies|Neimeyer|Milman|2014|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this meaning-making strategy, individuals create meaning of loss through their interactions with family members, and make more efforts to spend more time with them.&lt;ref name="Gillies"/&gt; When individuals use family to give meaning to loss, more meaning-making strategies emerge within the family system. A couple of strategies that family members use to help each other [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] are discussing the legacy of the deceased, and talking to non-family members about the loss.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{harvnb|Black|Santanello|Rubinstein|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When family members are able to openly express their attitudes and [[belief]]s, it can lead to a better well-being and less disagreement in the family.&lt;ref name="Davis 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|Harasymchuk|Wohl|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning-making with one's family also increases marital satisfaction by reducing family tension, especially if the deceased was another family member.&lt;ref name="Mackay"/&gt;

===Spirituality and religiosity===
Meaning-making through [[spirituality]] and [[religiosity]] is significant because it helps individuals cope with their loss, as well as develop their own spiritual or religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="Way"&gt;{{harvnb|Way|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spirituality and religiosity helps grievers think about a transcendental reality, share their worldview, and feel a sense of belonging to communities with shared beliefs.

When individuals with a [[divinity]] worldview make meaning through spirituality and religiosity, those "individuals perceive the divine to be involved in a major stressful life event" and use the divine to develop a meaning for the loss.&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Abraham|Bonar|McAuliffe|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main ways in which a [[theistic]] individual may create meaning through religion: benevolent religious reappraisals, punishing God reappraisals, and reappraisals of God's power.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt; Benevolent religious reappraisals cast God in a positive light and grievers may see the death as a part of God's plan. Punishing God reappraisals cast God in a dark light and grievers may blame God for the loss or feel punished by God. Reappraisals of God's power questions God's ability to intervene on the situation.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt; All of these appraisals contribute to how the griever may create meaning of their loss.

Another meaning-making strategy people use is to create meaning by valuing their own life. People who create meaning in this way may try to cherish the life they have, try to find their purpose, or change their lifestyles.&lt;ref name="Gillies"/&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Grievers can make meaning of death through philanthropic services such as charities, foundations, and organizations. Meaning-making through [[philanthropy]] can create financial support, social support, emotional support, and helps create positive results from the negative experience of the death.&lt;ref name="Rossetto"&gt;{{harvnb|Rossetto|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one couple that lost a child described how they developed "Nora's Project" after their daughter with a disability died, in order to help provide wheelchairs for children with disabilities around the world.&lt;ref name="Rossetto"/&gt; The mother said: "With Nora's Project, I am also healing. I am able to turn something that was horrific, the way she died, into something that will do good in the world".&lt;ref name="Rossetto"/&gt; Like this mother, it is common for individuals to want to create or do something positive for others. Philanthropy helps people make meaning by continuously and altruistically honoring a life while simultaneously helping others going through a similar experience.&lt;ref name="Rossetto"/&gt;

'''Nabta Playa''' was once a large [[Endorheic basin|internally drained basin]] in the [[Nubian Desert]], located approximately 800 kilometers south of modern-day [[Cairo]]&lt;ref name="nubia"&gt;{{Citation | last = Slayman | first = Andrew L. | title =  Neolithic Skywatchers | publisher = [[Archaeological Institute of America]] | date = May 27, 1998 | url = http://www.archaeology.org/online/news/nubia.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or about 100 kilometers west of [[Abu Simbel]] in southern [[Egypt]],&lt;ref name="WendorfSAA98"&gt;{{Citation | last = Wendorf | first = Fred | author-link = Fred Wendorf | last2 = Schild | first2 = Romuald | author2-link = Romuald Schild | title = Late Neolithic megalithic structures at Nabta Playa (Sahara), southwestern Egypt | publisher = Comparative Archaeology Web | date = November 26, 2000 | url = http://www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806140123/http://www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html | archivedate = August 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 22.51° north, 30.73° east.&lt;ref name=brophy1/&gt; Today the region is characterized by numerous [[archaeological]] sites.&lt;ref name="WendorfSAA98"/&gt;

== Early history ==
Although today the western Egyptian desert is totally dry, this was not always the case. There is good evidence that there were several humid periods in the past (when up to 500&amp;nbsp;mm of rain would fall per year), the most recent one during the last [[interglacial]] and early last glaciation periods which stretched between 130,000 and 70,000 years ago. During this time, the area was a [[savanna]] and supported numerous animals such as extinct buffalo and large giraffes, varieties of antelope and gazelle. Beginning around the [[10th millennium BC]], this region of the [[Nubian Desert]] began to receive more rainfall, filling a lake.&lt;ref name="WendorfSAA98"/&gt; Early people may have been attracted to the region due to the source of water..

[[Archaeological]] findings may indicate human occupation in the region dating to at least somewhere around the [[10th millennium BC|10th]] and [[8th millennium BC|8th millennia BC]].&lt;ref name="WendorfSAA98"/&gt; [[Fred Wendorf]], the site's discoverer, and ethno-linguist  [[Christopher Ehret]] have suggested that the people who occupied this region at that time were early pastoralists, or like the [[Sami people|Saami]] practiced semi-pastoralism (although this is disputed by other sources because the cattle remains found at Nabta have been shown to be morphologically wild in several studies, and nearby Saharan sites such as [[Uan Afada]] in Libya were penning wild [[Barbary sheep]], an animal that was never domesticated). The people of that time consumed and stored [[Sorghum leiocladum|wild sorghum]], and used [[ceramic]]s&lt;ref name="WendorfSAA98"/&gt; adorned by complicated [[paint]]ed patterns created perhaps by using [[comb]]s made from fish bone and which belong to a general pottery tradition strongly associated with the southern parts of the sahara (e.g., of the [[Khartoum]] mesolithic and various contemporary sites in [[Chad]]) of that period.&lt;ref name="WendorfSAA98"/&gt;  Analysis of human remains by Fred Wendorf and reported in "Holocene Settlement of the Egyptian Sahara", based on [[Osteology|osteological]] data  suggests a subsaharan origin for the site's inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Wendorf 2001 489–502"&gt;{{citation | last = Wendorf | first = Fred | last2 = Malville | first2 = J. McKim | editor-last = Wendorf | editor-first = Fred | editor2-last = Schild | editor2-first = Romuald | editor3-last = Nelson | editor3-first = Kit| year = 2001 | chapter = The Megalith Alignments | title = In Holocene Settlement of the Egyptian Sahara, vol. I,  The archaeology of Nabta Playa | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum | place = New York | isbn = 0-306-46612-0 | pages = 489–502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}  Several scholars also support a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan linguistic affinity]] for the Nabta people; including Fred Wendorf and Christopher Ehret.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

By the [[7th millennium BC]], exceedingly large and organized [[town|settlements]] were found in the region, relying on deep [[water well|wells]] for sources of water.&lt;ref name="WendorfSAA98"/&gt; [[Hut]]s were constructed in straight [[wikt:row|row]]s.&lt;ref name="WendorfSAA98"/&gt; Sustenance included [[fruit]], [[legume]]s, [[millet]]s, [[sorghum]] and [[tuber]]s.&lt;ref name="WendorfSAA98"/&gt;

Also in the late [[7th millennium BC]], but a little later than the time referred to above, imported [[goat]]s and [[sheep]], apparently from Western Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806140123/http://www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html |archivedate=August 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; appear. Many large [[hearth]]s also appear.&lt;ref name="WendorfSAA98"/&gt;

== Organization ==
[[Archaeological]] discoveries reveal that these [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] peoples led livelihoods seemingly at a higher level of organization than their contemporaries who lived closer to the [[Nile|Nile Valley]].&lt;ref name="WendorfSAA98"/&gt; The people of Nabta Playa had above-ground and below-ground [[Rock (geology)|stone]] [[construction]],
[[village]]s designed in pre-planned arrangements, and deep [[Water well|wells]] that held water throughout the year.

Findings also indicate that the region was occupied only seasonally, most likely only in the [[summer]] period, when the local lake filled with water for grazing [[cattle]].&lt;ref name="WendorfSAA98"/&gt; Comparative research indicated that the indigenous inhabitants may have a significantly more advanced knowledge of astronomy and mathematics than previously thought possible.

== Religious ties to ancient Egypt ==
By the [[6th millennium BC]], evidence of a prehistoric [[religion]] or [[cult]] appears, with a number of [[sacrifice]]d cattle buried in [[rock (geology)|stone]]-roofed chambers lined with [[clay]].&lt;ref name="WendorfSAA98"/&gt; It has been suggested that the associated [[Cattle in religion|cattle cult]] indicated in Nabta Playa marks an early evolution of [[Ancient Egypt]]'s [[Hathor]] [[cult (religious practice)|cult]]. For example, Hathor was worshipped as a nighttime protector in desert regions (see [[Serabit el-Khadim]]). To directly quote professors Wendorf and Schild:&lt;ref name="WendorfSAA98"/&gt;
{{bquote|... there are many aspects of political and ceremonial life in [[prehistoric Egypt]] and the Old Kingdom that reflects a strong impact from [[Sahara]]n cattle [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]]...}}

Other subterranean complexes are also found in Nabta Playa, one of which included evidence of what Wendorf described as perhaps "the oldest known sculpture in Egypt.&lt;ref name="WendorfSAA98"/&gt;
 
== Astronomical observation ==
[[File:Calendar aswan.JPG|300px|thumb|Nabta Playa "calendar circle", reconstructed at Aswan Nubia museum]]

By the [[5th millennium BC]] these peoples had fashioned what may be among the world's earliest known [[Archeoastronomy|archeoastronomical]] devices (roughly contemporary to the [[Goseck circle]] in Germany and the [[Mnajdra]] megalithic temple complex in Malta).  These include alignments of stones that may have indicated the rising of certain stars and a "[[calendar]] circle" that indicates the approximate direction of [[summer]] [[solstice]] sunrise.&lt;ref name="Malville_2015"&gt;{{Citation | last = Malville | first = J.

===Claims for early alignments and star maps===

Astrophysicist Thomas G. Brophy suggests the hypothesis that the southerly line of three stones inside the Calendar Circle represented the three stars of Orion’s Belt and the other three stones inside the calendar circle represented the shoulders and head stars of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] as they appeared in the sky. These correspondences were for two dates—circa 4,800 BC and at precessional opposition—representing how the sky "moves" long term. Brophy proposes that the circle was constructed and used circa the later date, and the dual date representation was a conceptual representation of the motion of the sky over a precession cycle.

Near the Calendar Circle, which is made of smaller stones, there are alignments of large megalithic stones. The southerly lines of these megaliths, Brophy shows, aligned to the same stars as represented in the Calendar Circle, all at the same epoch, circa 6270 BC. The Calendar Circle correlation with Orion's belt occurred between 6400 BC and 4900 BC, matching the radio-carbon dating of campfires around the circle.&lt;ref name="brophy1"/&gt;

==Recent research==

A 2007 article by a team of University of Colorado archaeoastronomers and archaeologists (three members had been involved in the original discovery of the site and its astronomical alignment)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Oldest Astronomical Megalith Alignment Discovered In Southern Egypt By Science Team | date = 1998-03-31 | publisher = University of Colorado | place = Boulder, CO | url = http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/1998/03/31/oldest-astronomical-megalith-alignment-discovered-southern-egypt-science | last = Scott | first = J | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140518031254/http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/1998/03/31/oldest-astronomical-megalith-alignment-discovered-southern-egypt-science | archivedate = 2014-05-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; has responded to the work of Brophy and Rosen, in particular their claims for an alignment with [[Sirius]] in 6088 and other alignments which they dated to 6270, saying that these dates were about 1500 years earlier than the estimated dates. The Sirius alignment in question was originally proposed by Wendorf and Malville,&lt;ref name="Wendorf 2001 489–502"/&gt; for one of the most prominent alignments of megaliths labelled the "C-line", which they said aligned to the rising of Sirius circa 4820 BC.  Brophy and Rosen showed in 2005 that megalith orientations and star positions reported by Wendorf and Malville were in error, noting that "Given these corrected data, we see that Sirius actually aligned with the C line circa 6000 BC. We estimate that 6088 BC Sirius had a declination of -36.51 deg, for a rising azimuth exactly on the C-line average".&lt;ref name="brophy1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rhodes.aegean.gr/maa_journal/issues/past%20issues/volume%205%20no1%20june%202005/brophy.pdf |last=Brophy |first=TG |author2=Rosen PA |title=Satellite Imagery Measures of the Astronomically Aligned Megaliths at Nabta Playa |journal=Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry |volume=5 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=15–24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229170244/http://www.rhodes.aegean.gr/maa_journal/issues/past%20issues/volume%205%20no1%20june%202005/brophy.pdf |archivedate=February 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Malville acknowledged the corrections made by Brophy and Rosen, but concluded the C-line of megaliths "may not represent an original set of aligned stele; we refrain from interpreting that alignment."&lt;ref name = Malville2007/&gt;

They also criticised suggestions made by Brophy in his book ''The Origin Map'' that there was a representation of the [[Milky Way]] as it was in 17,500 BC and maps of Orion at 16500 BC, saying "These extremely early dates as well as the proposition that the [[Ancient astronauts|nomads had contact with extraterrestrial life]] are inconsistent with the archaeological record. Inference in archaeoastronomy must always be guided and informed by archaeology, especially when substantial field work has been performed in the region.&lt;ref name = Malville2007&gt;{{cite journal | last=Malville | first = J McKim | author2=Schild, R. | author3=Wendorf, F. | author4=Brenmer, R | title=Astronomy of Nabta Playa | journal = African Skies/Cieux Africains | year=2007 | volume=11 | bibcode=2007AfrSk..11....2M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They propose that the area was first used as what they call a 'regional ceremonial centre' around 6100 to 5600 BC with people coming from various locations to gather on the dunes surrounding the playa where there is archaeological evidence for gatherings which involved large numbers of cattle bones, as cattle were normally only killed on important occasions. Around 5500 BC a new, more organised group began to use the site, burying cattle in clay-lined chambers and building other tumuli. Around 4800 BC a stone circle was constructed, with narrow slabs approximately aligned with the summer solstice, near the beginning of the rainy season.

More complex structures followed during a megalith period the researchers dated to between about 4500 BC to 3600 BC. Using their original measurements and measurements by satellite and GPS measurements by Brophy and Rosen they confirmed possible alignments with Sirius, [[Arcturus]], [[Alpha Centauri]] and the Belt of Orion.  They suggest that there are three pieces of evidence suggesting astronomical observations by the herdsmen using the site, which may have functioned as a [[necropolis]]. "The repetitive orientation of megaliths, stele, human burials and cattle burials reveals a very early symbolic connection to the north." Secondly, there is the orientation of the cromlech mentioned above. The third piece of evidence is the fifth millennium alignments of stele to bright stars.&lt;ref name = Malville2007/&gt;

They conclude their report by writing that "The symbolism embedded in the archaeological record of Nabta Playa in the Fifth Millennium BC is very basic, focussed on issues of major practical importance to the nomads: cattle, water, death, earth, sun and stars."&lt;ref name = Malville2007/&gt;

PGIS combines [[Participatory Learning and Action]] (PLA) methods with [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch01_overview_pp13-19.pdf |title=Overview: Mapping for Change: The emergence of a new practice |author1=Jon Corbett |author2=Giacomo Rambaldi |author3=Peter Kyem |author4=Dan Weiner |author5=Rachel Olson |author6=Julius Muchemi |author7=Mike McCall |author8=Robert Chambers |year=2006 |work=54:13-19 IIED, London, UK |publisher=iapad.org |accessdate=30 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081053/http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch01_overview_pp13-19.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; PGIS combines a range of geo-spatial information management tools and methods such as sketch maps, [[participatory 3D modelling]] (P3DM), [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and [[global positioning system]] (GPS) data to represent peoples' spatial knowledge in the forms of (virtual or physical) two- or three-dimensional maps used as interactive vehicles for spatial learning, discussion, information exchange, analysis, decision making and advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ejisdc.org/ojs/include/getdoc.php?id=246&amp;article=263&amp;mode=pdf |title=Participatory Spatial Information Management and Communication in Developing Countries |author=Rambaldi G., Kwaku Kyem A.

PGIS practice is geared towards community empowerment through measured, demand-driven, user-friendly and integrated applications of geo-spatial technologies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} GIS-based maps and spatial analysis become major conduits in the process. A good PGIS practice is embedded into long-lasting spatial decision-making processes, is flexible, adapts to different socio-cultural and bio-physical environments, depends on multidisciplinary facilitation and skills and builds essentially on visual language. The practice integrates several tools and methods whilst often relying on the combination of 'expert' skills with socially differentiated local knowledge. It promotes interactive participation of stakeholders in generating and managing spatial information and it uses information about specific landscapes to facilitate broadly-based decision making processes that support effective communication and community advocacy.

If appropriately utilized,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch14_rambaldi_pp106-113.pdf |title=Practical ethics for PGIS practitioners, facilitators, technology intermediaries and researchers |author1=Gicomo Rambaldi |author2=Robert Chambers |author3=Mike McCall |author4=Jefferson Fox |year=2006 |work=PLA 54:106-113, IIED, London, UK |publisher=iapad.org |accessdate=30 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081038/http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch14_rambaldi_pp106-113.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the practice could exert profound impacts on community empowerment, innovation and social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ejisdc.org/ojs/include/getdoc.php?id=247&amp;article=264&amp;mode=pdf |title=Participatory Mapping and Geographic Information Systems: Whose Map?

The '''portraiture of Elizabeth I of England''' illustrates the evolution of English royal [[portrait]]s in the [[Early Modern period]] from the representations of simple likenesses to the later complex imagery used to convey the power and aspirations of the state, as well as of the monarch at its head.

Even the earliest portraits of [[Elizabeth I]] (1533–1603) contain [[symbol]]ic objects such as [[rose]]s and prayer books that would have carried meaning to viewers of her day. Later portraits of Elizabeth layer the [[iconography]] of [[empire]]—[[globe]]s, [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]], [[sword]]s and [[column]]s—and representations of [[virginity]] and purity—such as [[moon]]s and [[pearl]]s—with [[Classical antiquity|classical]] allusions to present a complex "story" that conveyed to [[Elizabethan era]] viewers the majesty and significance of their Virgin Queen.

==Overview==

===Portraiture in Tudor England===
{{Main|Artists of the Tudor court}}
Two portraiture traditions had arisen in the Tudor court since the days of Elizabeth's father, [[Henry VIII]].  The [[portrait miniature]] developed from the [[illuminated manuscript]] tradition.  These small personal images were almost invariably painted from life over the space of a few days in [[watercolour]]s on [[vellum]] stiffened by being glued to a [[playing card]]. [[Panel painting]]s in [[oil painting|oils]] on prepared wood surfaces were based on preparatory drawings and were usually executed at life size, as were oil paintings on canvas.

Unlike her contemporaries in France, Elizabeth never granted rights to produce her portrait to a single artist, although [[Nicholas Hilliard]] was appointed her official [[limning|limner]] or miniaturist and goldsmith. [[George Gower]], a fashionable court portraitist created [[Serjeant Painter]] in 1581, was responsible for approving all portraits of the queen created by other artists from that date until his death in 1596.&lt;ref name="GI"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Elizabeth sat to a number of artists over the years, including Hilliard, [[Cornelis Ketel]], [[Federico Zuccari|Federico Zuccaro or Zuccari]], [[Isaac Oliver]], and most likely to Gower and [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]].&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt;

Portraits were commissioned by the government as gifts to foreign monarchs and to show to prospective suitors.  Courtiers commissioned heavily symbolic paintings to demonstrate their devotion to the queen.  The fashionable [[long gallery|long galleries]] of later Elizabethan [[country house]]s were filled with sets of portraits.  The studios of Tudor artists produced images of Elizabeth working from approved "face patterns" or drawings of the queen to meet this growing demand for her image, an important symbol of loyalty and reverence for the crown in times of turbulence.&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt;

===European context===
Far the most impressive models available to English portraitists were the many portraits by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], the outstanding Northern portraitist of the first half of the century, who had made two lengthy visits to England and been Henry VIII's court artist.  Holbein had accustomed the English court to the full-length life-size portrait,&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 25–6.  This was in notable contrast to France, in particular, where smaller portraits remained more typical until [[Henry IV of France]] came to power in 1594.&lt;/ref&gt; although none of his originals now survive.  His great [[Whitehall Mural|dynastic mural]] at [[Whitehall Palace]], destroyed in 1698, and perhaps other original large portraits, would have been familiar to Elizabethan artists.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Remigius van Leemput 001.jpg|image of a copy]] Waterhouse:19–22, who points out that only very high ranking persons could enter the room where it was when the court was in residence at Whitehall.  But artists could probably have gained access during the long periods the monarch was elsewhere; certainly there are many apparent copies of the figure of Henry from this work.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Holbein and his great Italian contemporary [[Titian]] had combined great psychological penetration with a sufficiently majestic impression to satisfy their royal patrons.  By his second visit Holbein was already moving away from a strictly realist depiction; in his ''[[Jane Seymour]]'' "the figure is no longer seen as displacing with its bulk a recognizable section of space: it approaches rather to a flat pattern, made alive by a bounding and vital outline".&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse:19&lt;/ref&gt;  This tendency was to be taken much further by the later portraits of Elizabeth, where "Likeness of feature and an interest in form and volume have gradually been abandoned in favour of an effect of splendid majesty obtained by decorative pattern, and the forms have been flattened accordingly".&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Titian continued to paint royal portraits, especially of [[Philip II of Spain]], until the 1570s, but in sharply reduced numbers after about 1555, and he refused to travel from Venice to do them.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Jennifer in: David Jaffé (ed), ''Titian'', pp. 31–2, The National Gallery Company/Yale, London 2003, {{ISBN|1-85709-903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The full-length portrait of Philip (1550–51) now in the [[Prado]] was sent to Elizabeth's elder sister and predecessor [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] in advance of their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Tizian 084.jpg|Image]] It came from Philip's aunt [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary]] in Brussels, presumably as a loan. Fletcher, op. cit. pp. 31 and 148.  It was presumably returned by or after Mary I's death in 1558, as it is in a Spanish royal inventory of 1600.  Prado:398–99 (#411). The painting has returned to London for an exhibition at the National Gallery until January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the mid-century the most influential Continental courts came to prefer less revealing and intimate works,&lt;ref&gt;For analysis of this trend see Levey (1971, Ch. 3, and Trevor-Roper (1976) Ch. 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the mid-century the two most prominent and influential royal portraitists in paint, other than Titian, were the Netherlandish [[Anthonis Mor]] and [[Agnolo Bronzino]] in [[Florence]], besides whom the Habsburg court sculptor and medallist [[Leone Leoni]] should also be mentioned.  Mor, who had risen rapidly to prominence in 1540s, worked across Europe for the Habsburgs in a tighter and more rigid version of Titian's compositional manner, drawing also on the North Italian style of [[Moretto da Brescia|Moretto]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 27–8. For his relationship with the Habsburgs, see Trevor-Roper (1976) passim, who also covers those of Leone Leoni and Titian in detail.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mor had actually visited London in 1554, and painted three versions of his well-known portrait of Queen Mary; he also painted English courtiers who visited Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), p. 28. Surviving portraits include those of [[Sir Thomas Gresham]] and [[Sir Henry Lee]], who was later to commission the ''Ditchley Portrait''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mor's Spanish pupil [[Alonso Sánchez Coello]] continued in a stiffer version of his master's style, replacing him  as Spanish court painter in 1561.  [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] had painted in an intimately informal style, but after her recruitment to the Spanish court as the Queen's painter in 1560 was able to adapt her style to the much more formal demands of state portraiture.  Moretto's pupil [[Giovanni Battista Moroni]] was Mor's contemporary and formed his mature style in the 1550s, but few of his spirited portraits were of royalty, or yet to be seen outside Italy.&lt;ref&gt;And even in Italy his best portraits were routinely attributed to Titian or Moretto, for example what has always been his most famous work, the so-called ''Titian's Schoolmaster'', now in Washington but previously in the [[Palazzo Borghese]] in Rome.  Penny:194–5 on his life and style, 196–7 on his reputation. Freedberg (1993), pp. 593–5 analyses his portrait style.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bronzino]] developed a style of coldly distant magnificence, based on the [[Mannerist]] portraits of [[Pontormo]], working almost entirely for [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]], the first Medici Grand-Duke.&lt;ref&gt;In an extended discussion, [[Michael Levey]] says Bronzino showed the ducal family "so wrought and congealed that there is nothing of living tissue left in them. Their hands have turned to ivory, and their eyes to pieces of beautifully cut, faceted jet." Levey (1971), pp. 96–108 — quotation from p. 108.  See also Freedberg (1993), pp. 430–35&lt;/ref&gt;  Bronzino's works, including his striking portraits of Cosimo's Duchess, [[Eleanor of Toledo]] were distributed in many versions across Europe, continuing to be made for two decades from the same studio pattern; a new portrait painted in her last years, about 1560, exists in only a few repetitions.  At the least many of the foreign painters in London are likely to have seen versions of the earlier type, and there may well have been one in the [[Royal Collection]].

French portraiture remained dominated by small but finely drawn bust-length or half-length works, including many drawings, often with colour, by [[François Clouet]] following, with a host of imitators, his father [[Jean Clouet|Jean]], or even smaller oils by the Netherlandish [[Corneille de Lyon]] and his followers, typically no taller than a paperback book.  A few full-length portraits of royalty were produced, dependent on German or Italian models.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, pp. 62–64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating the royal image===
[[File:El bieta I lat 13.jpg|thumb|upright|''Elizabeth Tudor as a Princess'', c. 1546, by an unknown artist.]]
William Gaunt contrasts the simplicity of the 1546 portrait of ''Elizabeth Tudor as a Princess'' with later images of her as queen.  He wrote, "The painter...is unknown, but in a competently Flemish style he depicts the daughter of [[Anne Boleyn]] as quiet and studious-looking, ornament in her attire as secondary to the plainness of line that emphasizes her youth. Great is the contrast with the awesome fantasy of the later portraits: the pallid, mask-like features, the extravagance of headdress and ruff, the padded ornateness that seemed to exclude all humanity."&lt;ref&gt;Gaunt, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of emphasis given to depicting depth and volume in her later portraits may have been influenced by the Queen's own views. In the ''Art of Limming'' Hilliard cautioned against all but the minimal use of [[chiaroscuro]] modelling that we see in his works, reflecting the views of his patron: "seeing that best to show oneself needeth no shadow of place but rather the open light...Her Majesty..chose her place to sit for that purpose in the open alley of a goodly garden, where no tree was near, nor any shadow at all..."&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from Hilliard's ''Art of Limming'', c. 1600, in ''Nicholas Hilliard'', [[Roy Strong]], 1975, p.24, Michael Joseph Ltd, London, {{ISBN|0-7181-1301-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1570s, the government sought to manipulate the image of the queen as an object of devotion and veneration.  Sir [[Roy Strong]] writes: "The cult of Gloriana was skilfully created to buttress public order and, even more, deliberately to replace the pre-[[English Reformation|Reformation]] externals of religion, the cult of the [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]] and [[saint]]s with their attendant images, processions, ceremonies and secular rejoicing."&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1977, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  The pageantry of the [[Accession Day tilt]]s, the poetry of the court, and the most iconic of Elizabeth's portraits all reflect this effort.  The management of the queen's image reached its heights in the last decade of the reign, when realistic images of the aging queen were replaced with an eternally youthful vision defying the reality of the passage of time.

===The young queen===
Portraits of the young queen, many of them likely painted to be shown to prospective suitors and foreign heads of state, show a naturalness and restraint similar to those in the portrait of Elizabeth as a princess.
[[File:Elizabeth I Steven Van Der Meulen.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Hampden Portrait'' of Elizabeth I, by Van Der Meulen, 1560s]]

The full-length ''Hampden'' image of Elizabeth in a red satin gown by [[Steven van der Meulen]] has been identified by Sir Roy Strong as an important early portrait, "undertaken at a time when her image was being tightly controlled. 'This is a portrait dating from the mid to late 1560s, one of a group produced in response to a crisis over the production of the royal image, one which was reflected in the words of a draft proclamation dated 1563,' he said."&lt;ref name="IND"&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20071101/ai_n21092731 Portrait of a royal quest for a husband]". ''The Independent'', (London), Nov 1, 2007. Retrieved on 24 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The draft proclamation (never published) was a response to the circulation of poorly made portraits in which Elizabeth is shown "in blacke with a [[French hood|hoode and cornet]]", a style she no longer wore.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In these portraits Elizabeth may be wearing [[mourning]] for her sister Mary; see commentary on a portrait ([[:Image:Mary Queen of Scots French School c 1558-60.jpg|Image]]) of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in a similar black gown and French hood with the cornet or ''bongrace'' pinned up at {{cite web|url=http://www.historicalportraits.com/InternalMain.asp |title=Mary Queen of Scots (1542 - 1587) c. 1558 |work=Historical Portraits Image Library |accessdate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016154526/http://www.historicalportraits.com/InternalMain.asp |archivedate=2008-10-16 |df= }}, where the costume is compared to Elizabeth's in the ''Clopton'' portrait type.&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbolism in these pictures is in keeping with earlier Tudor portraiture; in some Elizabeth holds a book (possibly a prayer book) suggesting studiousness or piety. In other paintings she holds or wears a red rose, symbol of the [[Tudor Dynasty]]'s descent from the [[House of Lancaster]], or white roses, symbols of the [[House of York]] and of maidenly chastity.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Hampden portrait, Elizabeth wears a red rose on her shoulder and holds a [[gillyflower]] in her hand.  Of this image, Strong says "'Here Elizabeth is caught in that short-lived period before what was a recognisable human became transmuted into a goddess'."&lt;ref name="IND" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This newly revealed portrait was sold at Sotheby's, London, for £2.6 million in November 2007.[https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSL2246809920071122?sp=true Reuters news story]&lt;/ref&gt;

One artist active in Elizabeth's early court was the [[Flanders|Flemish]] miniaturist [[Levina Teerlinc]] who had served as a painter and [[gentlewoman]] to [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and stayed on as a Gentlewoman of the Privy Chamber to Elizabeth. Teerlinc is best known for her pivotal position in the rise of the portrait miniature. There is documentation that she created numerous portraits of Elizabeth I, both individual portraits and portraits of the sovereign with important court figures, but only a few of these have survived and been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 55–57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabeth and the goddesses===
[[File:Eworth Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses 1569.jpg|thumb|''Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses'', 1569]] Two surviving [[allegory|allegorical]] paintings show the early use of classical mythology to illustrate the beauty and sovereignty of the young queen.  In ''Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses'' (1569), attributed to [[Hans Eworth]],&lt;ref&gt;The portrait is signed "H.E." and the artist formerly identified as the "Monogrammist H.E." is now generally assumed to be Hans Eworth (Hearn 1995, p. 63). Strong had earlier attributed the painting to [[Joris Hoefnagel]] (Strong 1987, p. 42).&lt;/ref&gt; the story of the [[Judgement of Paris]] is turned on its head.  Elizabeth, rather than Paris, is now sent to choose among [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and [[Athena|Pallas-Minerva]], all of whom are outshone by the queen with her crown and royal [[Globus cruciger|orb]].  As Susan Doran writes, "Implicit to the theme of the painting ... is the idea that Elizabeth's retention of royal power benefits her realm. Whereas Paris's judgement in the original myth resulted in the long [[Trojan War]]s 'to the utter ruin of the Trojans', hers will conversely bring peace and order to the state"&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; after the turbulent reign of Elizabeth's sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].

The latter theme lies behind the 1572 ''The Family of Henry VIII: An Allegory of the Tudor Succession'' (attributed to [[Lucas de Heere]]).  In this image, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Mary and her husband [[Philip II of Spain]] are accompanied by [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] the god of War on the left, while Protestant Elizabeth on the right ushers in the goddesses Peace and Plenty.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn 1995, pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription states that this painting was a gift from the queen to [[Francis Walsingham]] as a "Mark of her people's and her own content" and this may indicate that it commemorates the signing of the [[Treaty of Blois (1572)]] which established an alliance between England and France against Spanish aggression in the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]] during Walsingham's tour of duty as ambassador to the French court.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, pp.185–86&lt;/ref&gt;  Strong identifies both paintings as celebrations of Elizabeth's just rule by Flemish exiles to whom England was a refuge from the religious persecution of Protestants in the Spanish Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hilliard and the queen===
{{Main|Nicholas Hilliard}}
[[File:Hilliard Elizabeth I 1572 v2.jpg|left|thumb|Miniature by Hilliard, 1572]]
[[File:Elizabeth1 Phoenix.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Phoenix Portrait'', c. 1575, attributed to Hilliard]]
[[File:Hilliard Emmanuel College Charter.gif|thumb|upright|Emmanuel College charter, 1584]]
Nicholas Hilliard was an apprentice to the Queen's jeweller Robert Brandon,&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; a goldsmith and city chamberlain of London, and Sir Roy Strong suggests that Hilliard may also have been trained in the art of limning by Levina Teerlinc.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; Hilliard emerged from his apprenticeship at a time when a new royal portrait painter was "desperately needed."&lt;ref name="G"&gt;Strong 1987, p. 79–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilliard's first known miniature of the Queen is dated 1572. It is not known when he was formally appointed limner (miniaturist) and goldsmith to Elizabeth,&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, ''Hilliard and Oliver'', pp. 11–18&lt;/ref&gt; though he was granted the reversion of a lease by the Queen in 1573 for his "good, true and loyal service."&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1975, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Two panel portraits long attributed to him, the ''Phoenix'' and ''Pelican'' portraits, are dated c. 1572–76.  These paintings are named after the jewels the queen wears, her personal badges of the [[Pelican#Symbolism and culture|pelican in her piety]] and the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].  National Portrait Gallery researchers announced in September 2010 that the two portraits were painted on wood from the same two trees. They also found that a tracing of the Phoenix portrait matches the Pelican portrait in reverse. They therefore deduce that both pictures of Elizabeth in her forties were painted around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11277451  Pelican and Phoenix research]&lt;/ref&gt;

But Hilliard's panel portraits seem to have been found wanting, and in 1576 the recently married Hilliard left for France to improve his skills.  Returning to England, he continued to work as a goldsmith, and produced some spectacular "picture boxes" or jewelled lockets for miniatures: the ''Armada Jewel'', given by Elizabeth to Sir [[Thomas Heneage]] and the ''Drake Pendant'' given to Sir [[Francis Drake]] are the best known examples.  As part of the cult of the Virgin Queen, courtiers were rather expected to wear the Queen's likeness, at least at Court.

His appointment as miniaturist to the Crown included the old sense of a painter of [[illuminated manuscript]]s and he was commissioned to decorate important documents, such as the founding [[charter]] of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] (1584), which has an enthroned Elizabeth under a [[Baldachin|canopy of estate]] within an elaborate framework of Flemish-style Renaissance strapwork and [[grotesque]] ornament.  He also seems to have designed [[woodcut]] title-page frames and borders for books, some of which bear his initials.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1983, pp. 62 &amp; 66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darnley stage 3.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The ''Darnley Portrait'', c. 1575]]

===The Darnley Portrait===
The problem of an official portrait of Elizabeth was solved with the ''Darnley  Portrait''.&lt;ref&gt;So-called from its location at [[Cobham House]], much later the seat of the [[Earls of Darnley]]; see Strong 1987 p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Likely painted from life around 1575–6, this portrait is the source of a face pattern which would be used and reused for authorized portraits of Elizabeth into the 1590s, preserving the impression of ageless beauty.  Sir [[Roy Strong]] suggested that the artist is [[Federico Zuccari]] or Zucaro, an "eminent" Italian artist, though not really a specialist portrait-painter, who is known to have visited the court briefly with a letter of introduction to Elizabeth's [[favourite]] [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]] dated 5 March 1575.&lt;ref name="G2"&gt;Strong 1987, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; Zuccaro's preparatory drawings for full-length portraits of both Leicester and Elizabeth survive, although it is unlikely the full-length of Elizabeth was ever painted.&lt;ref name="G2" /&gt;  Curators at the National Portrait Gallery believe that the attribution of the Darnley portrait to Zuccaro is "not sustainable" and attribute the work to an unknown "continental" (possibly Netherlandish) artist.&lt;ref name="Real Tudors"&gt;Cooper and Bolland (2014), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Darnley Portrait'' features a crown and [[sceptre]] on a table beside the queen, and was the first appearance of these symbols of sovereignty separately used as [[Theatrical property|props]] (rather than worn and carried) in Tudor portraiture, a theme that would be expanded in later portraits.&lt;ref name="G2" /&gt;  Recent conservation work has revealed that Elizabeth's now-iconic pale complexion in this portrait is the result of deterioration of [[Red#Pigments and dyes|red lake pigments]], which has also altered the coloring of her dress.&lt;ref name="Real Tudors2"&gt;Cooper and Bolland (2014), pp. 162-167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Making Art"&gt;{{cite web|author = National Portrait Gallery |title = Making Art in Tudor Britain: 'Darnley' portrait | url = http://www.npg.org.uk/research/programmes/making-art-in-tudor-britain/case-studies/the-queens-likeness-portraits-of-elizabeth-i.php#darnleyportrait |year = 2014 | accessdate = 28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Virgin Empress of the Seas==

===Return of the Golden Age===
[[File:Elizabeth1England.jpg|thumb|The ''Ermine Portrait'', William Segar, 1585. Elizabeth as ''Pax''.]]
The [[excommunication]] of Elizabeth by [[Pope Pius V]] in 1570 led to increased tension with Philip II of Spain, who championed the Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], as the legitimate heir of his late wife Mary I.  This tension played out over the next decades in the seas of the [[New World]] as well as in Europe, and culminated in the invasion attempt of the [[Spanish Armada]].

It is against this backdrop that the first of a long series of portraits appears depicting Elizabeth with heavy symbolic overlays of imperial dominion based on mastery of the seas.&lt;ref name="G3"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 91–93&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with a second layer of symbolism representing Elizabeth as the Virgin Queen, these new paintings signify the manipulation of Elizabeth's image as the destined [[Protestant]] protector of her people.

Strong points out that there is no trace of this iconography in portraits of Elizabeth prior to 1579, and identifies its source as the conscious image-making of [[John Dee]], whose 1577 ''General and Rare Memorials Pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation'' encouraged the establishment of a British Empire supported by a strong navy, asserting Elizabeth's claims to imperial status via her supposed descent from [[Brutus of Troy]] and [[King Arthur]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Dee's inspiration lies in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]'', which was accepted as true history by Elizabethan poets{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} and formed the basis of the symbolic history of England.  In this twelfth century [[pseudohistory]], Britain was founded by and named after Brutus, the descendent of [[Aeneas]] who founded Rome.  The Tudors, of [[Wales|Welsh]] descent, are heirs of the most ancient Britons and thus of Aeneas and Brutus.  By uniting the Houses of York and Lancaster following the strife of the [[Wars of the Roses]], the Tudors ushered in a united realm where ''[[Pax (mythology)|Pax]]'' reigned.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spenserian scholar Edwin  Greenlaw states "The descent of the Britons from the Trojans, the linking of Arthur, Henry VIII, and Elizabeth as Britain's greatest monarchs, and the return under Elizabeth of the [[Golden Age]] are all commonplaces of Elizabethan thought."&lt;ref&gt;E[dwin] Greenlaw, ''Studies in Spenser's Historical Allegory,'' Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press, 1932, quoted in Yates, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of history and Elizabeth's place in it forms the background to the symbolic portraits of the latter half of her reign.

===The Virgin Queen===
[[File:George Gower Elizabeth Sieve Portrait.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The [[Plimpton Sieve Portrait of Queen Elizabeth I|Plimpton ''Sieve Portrait'']], Gower, 1579]]

A series of ''Sieve Portraits'' copy the ''Darnley'' face pattern and add an allegorical overlay that depicts Elizabeth as [[Tuccia]], a [[Vestal Virgin]] who proved her chastity by carrying a sieve full of water from the [[Tiber River]] to the [[Temple of Vesta]] without spilling a drop.&lt;ref&gt;See Hearn 1995, p. 85; Strong 1987, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''Sieve Portrait'' was painted by [[George Gower]] in 1579, but the most influential image is the 1583 version by [[Quentin Metsys the Younger|Quentin Metsys (or Massys) the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;Although Strong attributed the painting to [[Cornelis Ketel]] in 1969 and again in 1987 (Strong 1987 p. 101), closer examination has revealed that the painting is signed and dated on the base of the globe ''1583. Q. MASSYS | ANT'' (for "of Antwerp"). (See Hearn 1995, p. 85)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Metsys Elizabeth I The Sieve Portrait c1583.jpg|thumb|upright|The Siena ''Sieve Portrait'', Metsys the Younger, 1583]]

In the Metsys version, Elizabeth is surrounded by symbols of empire, including a column and a globe, iconography that would appear again and again in her portraiture of the 1580s and 1590s, most notably in the ''Armada Portrait'' of c. 1588.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, p. 85; Strong 1987 p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  The medallions on the pillar to the left of the queen illustrate the story  of [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] and Aeneas, ancestor of Brutus, suggesting that like Aeneas, Elizabeth's destiny is to reject marriage and found an empire.  This painting's patron was likely Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] (his [[heraldic badge]] of the white hind appears on the sleeve of one of the courtiers in the background), and the work may express opposition to the proposed marriage of Elizabeth to [[François, Duke of Anjou]].&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yates, p. 115"&gt;Yates, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The virgin Tuccia was familiar to Elizabethan readers from [[Petrarch]]'s "The Triumph of Chastity".  Another symbol from this work is the spotless [[ermine]], wearing a collar of gold studded with topazes.&lt;ref&gt;Yates pp. 115, 215–216&lt;/ref&gt; This symbol of purity appears in the ''Ermine Portrait'' of 1585, attributed to the [[herald]] [[William Segar]].  The queen bears the olive branch of ''Pax'' (Peace), and the sword of justice rests on the table at her side.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;  In combination, these symbols represent not only the personal purity of Elizabeth but the "righteousness and justice of her government."&lt;ref&gt;Yates, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visions of empire===
{{Main|Armada Portrait}}
[[File:Elizabeth I (Armada Portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|The Woburn Abbey version of the ''Armada Portrait'', c. 1588]]
The ''[[Armada Portrait]]'' is an [[allegory|allegorical]] panel painting depicting the queen surrounded by symbols of empire against a backdrop representing the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.

There are three surviving versions of the portrait, in addition to several derivative paintings.  The version at [[Woburn Abbey]], the seat of the [[Duke of Bedford|Dukes of Bedford]], was long accepted as the work of George Gower, who had been appointed [[Serjeant Painter]] in 1581.&lt;ref name="GLORIANA"&gt;Strong 1987, ''Gloriana'', p. 130–133&lt;/ref&gt;  A version in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery, London]], which has been cut down at both sides leaving just a portrait of the queen, was also formerly attributed to Gower.  A third version, owned by the Tyrwhitt-Drake family, may have been commissioned by Sir [[Francis Drake]]. Scholars agree that this version is by a different hand, noting distinctive techniques and approaches to the modelling of the queen's features.&lt;ref name="GLORIANA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="H"&gt;Hearn 1995 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This version was heavily overpainted in the later 17th century, which complicates attribution and may account for several differences in details of the costume.  See  Arnold, ''Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd'', pp. 34–36&lt;/ref&gt; Curators now believe that the three extant versions are all the output of different workshops under the direction of unknown English artists.&lt;ref name="Real Tudors3"&gt;Cooper and Bolland (2014), pp. 151-154&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of a life-sized portrait of the queen with a horizontal format is "quite unprecedented in her portraiture",&lt;ref name="GLORIANA" /&gt; although allegorical portraits in a horizontal format, such as ''Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses'' and the ''Family of Henry VIII: An Allegory of the Tudor Succession'' pre-date the ''Armada Portrait''.
[[File:Elizabeth I Crispin van de Passe 1596.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Engraving by Crispijn van de Passe, printed 1596]]
The queen's hand rests on a globe below the crown of England, "her fingers covering the Americas, indicating England's dominion of the seas and plans for imperialist expansion in the New World".&lt;ref&gt;Hearn 1995, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Andrew Belsey and [[Catherine Belsey]], "Icons of Divinity: Portraits of Elizabeth I" in Gent and Llewellyen, ''Renaissance Bodies'', pp. 11–35&lt;/ref&gt;  The Queen is flanked by two columns behind, probably a reference to the famous [[personal device|impresa]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V]], Philip II of Spain's father, which represented the [[pillars of Hercules]], gateway to the Atlantic Ocean and the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1984, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

In the background view on the left, English [[fireship]]s threaten the Spanish fleet, and on the right the ships are driven onto a rocky coast amid stormy seas by the "[[Protestant Wind]]". On a secondary level, these images show Elizabeth turning her back on storm and darkness while sunlight shines where she gazes.&lt;ref name="GLORIANA" /&gt;

An engraving by [[Crispijn van de Passe]] (Crispin van de Passe), published in 1596 but showing costume of the 1580s, carries similar iconography.  Elizabeth stands between two columns bearing her arms and the Tudor [[heraldic badge]] of a [[portcullis]].  The columns are surmounted by her emblems of a pelican in her piety and a phoenix, and ships fill the sea behind her.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===The cult of Elizabeth===
[[File:Queen Elizabeth I ('The Ditchley portrait') by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|upright|thumb|The ''Ditchley Portrait'', [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]], c.1592]]
The various threads of mythology and symbolism that created the iconography of Elizabeth I combined into a tapestry of immense complexity in the years following the defeat of the Spanish Armada.  In poetry, portraiture and pageantry, the queen was celebrated as [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], the just virgin, and simultaneously as [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the goddess of love.  Another exaltation of the queen's virgin purity identified her with the moon goddess who holds dominion over the waters.  Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] had begun to use [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and later [[Artemis#Worship of Artemis|Cynthia]] as aliases for the queen in his poetry around 1580, and images of Elizabeth with jewels in the shape of crescent moons or the huntress's arrows begin to appear in portraiture around 1586 and multiply through the remainder of the reign.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 125–127&lt;/ref&gt;  Courtiers wore the image of the Queen to signify their devotion, and had their portraits painted wearing her colours of black and white.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1977, pp. 70–75&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ditchley Portrait'' seems to have always been at the Oxfordshire home of Elizabeth's retired Champion, Sir [[Henry Lee of Ditchley]], and likely was painted for (or commemorates)  her two-day visit to Ditchley in 1592. The painting is attributed to Marcus Gheerearts the Younger, and was almost certainly based on a sitting arranged by Lee, who was the painter's patron.  In this image, the queen stands on a map of England, her feet on Oxfordshire.  The painting has been trimmed and the background poorly repainted, so that the inscription and sonnet are incomplete.  Storms rage behind her while the sun shines before her, and she wears a jewel in the form of a celestial or [[armillary sphere]] close to her left ear.  Many versions of this painting were made, likely in Gheeraerts' workshop, with the allegorical items removed and Elizabeth's features "softened" from the stark realism of her face in the original.  One of these was sent as a [[diplomatic gift]] to the [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke of Tuscany]] and is now in the [[Palazzo Pitti]].&lt;ref name="MG"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 135–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The last sitting and the Mask of Youth===
[[File:Isaac Oliver Elizabeth I of England.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Unfinished miniature, Oliver, c. 1592]]
[[File:Nicholas Hilliard Elizabeth I 1595-1600 v2.jpg|upright|thumb|Recently discovered miniature by Hilliard, 1595–1600]]
Around 1592, the queen also sat to Isaac Oliver, a pupil of Hilliard, who produced an unfinished portrait miniature (left) used as a pattern for [[engraving]]s of the queen.  Only a single finished miniature from this pattern survives, with the queen's features softened, and Strong concludes that this realistic image from life of the aging Elizabeth was not deemed a success.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1590s, woodcuts and engravings of the queen were created as book illustrations, but in this decade individual prints of the queen first appear, based on the Oliver face pattern.  In 1596, the Privy Council ordered that unseemly portraits of the queen which had caused her "great offence" should be sought out and burnt, and Strong suggest that these prints, of which comparatively few survive, may be the offending images.  Strong writes "It must have been exposure to the searching realism of both Gheeraerts and Oliver that provoked the decision to suppress all likenesses of the queen that depicted her as being in any way old and hence subject to mortality."&lt;ref name="Mask"&gt;Strong 1987, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

In any event, no surviving portraits dated between 1596 and Elizabeth's death in 1603 show the aging queen as she truly was.  Faithful resemblance to the original is only to be found in contemporaries’ accounts as in the report written in 1597 by André Hurault de Maisse, Ambassador Extraordinary from [[Henry IV of France]], after an audience with the sixty-five year-old queen, during which he noticed, "her teeth are very yellow and unequal […] and on the left side less than on the right. Many of them are missing, so that one cannot understand her easily when she speaks quickly." Yet he added, "her figure is fair and tall and graceful in whatever she does; so far as may be she keeps her dignity, yet humbly and graciously withal."&lt;ref&gt; De Maisse: a journal of all that was accomplished by Monsieur De Maisse, ambassador in England from King Henri IV to Queen Elizabeth, anno domini 1597, Nonesuch Press, 1931, p. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; All subsequent images rely on a face pattern devised by Nicholas Hilliard sometime in the 1590s called by art historians the "Mask of Youth", portraying Elizabeth as ever-young.&lt;ref name="Mask" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sotheby's Catalogue L07123, ''Important British Paintings 1500–1850'', November 2007, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 16 miniatures by Hilliard and his studio are known based on this face pattern, with different combinations of costume and jewels likely painted from life, and it was also adopted by (or enforced on) other artists associated with the Court.&lt;ref name="Mask" /&gt;

===The coronation portraits===
[[File:Elizabeth I Coronation Miniature.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Hilliard, c.1600]]
Two portraits of Elizabeth in her [[coronation]] robes survive, both dated to 1600 or shortly thereafter. One is a panel portrait in oils (&lt;small&gt;above&lt;/small&gt;) and the other is a miniature by Nicholas Hilliard.  The warrant to the queen's tailor for remodelling Mary I's cloth of gold coronation robes for Elizabeth survives, and costume historian [[Janet Arnold]]'s study points out that the paintings accurately reflect the written records, although the jewels differ in the two paintings,&lt;ref name="Coro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold 1978&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting two different sources, one possibly a miniature by Levina Teerlinc. It is not known why, and for whom, these portraits were created; at or just after the end of the reign.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Rainbow Portrait===
[[File:Elizabeth I Rainbow Portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|The ''Rainbow Porait'', c. 1600–02, attrib. Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]]
Attributed to [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]],&lt;ref&gt;Strong, Roy C. ''Gloriana: The Portraits of Queen Elizabeth I''. Germany: Thames and Hudson, 1987. pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the most heavily symbolic portrait of the queen is the ''Rainbow Portrait'' at [[Hatfield House]]. It was painted around 1600–1602, when the queen was in her sixties.  In this painting an ageless Elizabeth appears dressed as if for a [[masque]], in a linen bodice [[embroidery|embroidered]] with spring flowers and a mantle draped over one shoulder, her hair loose beneath a fantastical headdress.&lt;ref name="GR"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 157–160&lt;/ref&gt;  She wears symbols out of the popular [[emblem book]]s, including the cloak with eyes and ears, the serpent of wisdom, and the celestial [[armillary sphere]], and carries a rainbow with the motto ''non sine sol iris'' ("no rainbow without the sun").  Strong suggests that the complex "programme" for this image may be the work of the poet [[John Davies (poet)|John Davies]], whose ''Hymns to Astraea'' honouring the queen use much of the same imagery, and suggests it was commissioned by [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] as part of the decor for Elizabeth's visit in 1602, when a "shrine to Astraea" featured in the entertainments of what would prove to be the "last great festival of the reign".&lt;ref name="GR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cult"&gt;Strong 1977, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the wide dissemination of prints of the queen in the 1590s, the common people of Elizabeth's England would be most familiar with her image on the [[coin]]age.  In December 1560, a systematic recoinage of the debased money then in circulation was begun. The main early effort was the issuance of [[sterling silver]] [[shilling]]s and [[Groat (coin)|groats]], but new coins were issued in both silver and gold.  This restoration of the currency was one of the three principal achievements noted on Elizabeth's tomb, illustrating the value of stable currency to her contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003a, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  Later coinage represented the queen in iconic fashion, with the traditional accompaniments of [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] heraldic badges including the [[Tudor rose]] and [[portcullis]].

Books provided another widely available source of images of Elizabeth.  Her portrait appeared on the title page of the ''[[Bishops' Bible]]'', the standard Bible of the [[Church of England]], issued in 1568 and revised in 1572.  In various editions, Elizabeth is depicted with her orb and sceptre accompanied by female [[personification]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003a, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Reading" the portraits==
[[File:Elizabeth I Palazzo Pitti Florence.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence]]
It may be impossible for modern viewers to see the hundreds of images of Elizabeth as her subjects, courtiers, and rivals saw them.  The portraits are steeped in classical mythology and the [[Renaissance]] understanding of English history and destiny, filtered by [[allusion]]s to [[Petrarch]]'s [[sonnet]]s and, late in the reign, to [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]''.  Dame [[Frances Yates]] points out that the most complexly symbolic portraits may all commemorate specific events or have been designed as part of elaborate themed entertainments.&lt;ref name="Yates, p. 115"/&gt; The most familiar images of Elizabeth—the ''Armada'', ''Ditchley'', and ''Rainbow'' portraits—are all associated with unique events in this way.  To the extent that the contexts of other portraits have been lost to scholars, so too the keys to understanding these remarkable images as the Elizabethans understood them may be lost in time.  Even those portraits that are not overtly allegorical may be full of meaning to a discerning eye. Elizabethan courtiers familiar with the [[language of flowers]] and the Italian emblem books could have read stories in the blooms the queen carried, the embroidery on her clothes, and the design of her jewels.

According to [[Roy Strong]], &lt;blockquote&gt;Fear of the wrong use and perception of the visual image dominates the Elizabethan age. The old pre-Reformation idea of images, religious ones, was that they partook of the essence of what they depicted. Any advance in technique which could reinforce that experience was embraced. That was now reversed, indeed it may account for the Elizabethans failing to take cognisance of the optical advances which created the art of the Italian Renaissance. They certainly knew about these things but, and this is central to the understanding of the Elizabethans, chose not to employ them. Instead the visual arts retreated in favour of presenting a series of signs or symbols through which the viewer was meant to pass to an understanding of the idea behind the work. In this manner the visual arts were verbalised, turned into a form of book, a 'text' which called for reading by the onlooker. There are no better examples of this than the quite extraordinary portraits of the queen herself, which increasingly, as the reign progressed, took on the form of collections of abstract pattern and symbols disposed in an unnaturalistic manner for the viewer to unravel, and by doing so enter into an inner vision of the idea of monarchy."&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Radiosurgery''' is [[surgery]] using [[radiation]],&lt;ref name="Dorlands"&gt;{{Citation |author=Elsevier |authorlink=Elsevier |title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |publisher=Elsevier |url=http://dorlands.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the destruction of precisely selected areas of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] using [[ionizing radiation]] rather than excision with a blade. Like other forms of [[radiation therapy]] (also called radiotherapy), it is usually used to treat [[cancer]]. Radiosurgery was originally defined by the Swedish neurosurgeon [[Lars Leksell]] as "a single high dose fraction of radiation, stereotactically directed to an intracranial region of interest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leksell|first=Lars|title=The stereotaxic method and radiosurgery of the brain|journal=Acta Chirurgica Scandinavica|date=December 1951 |volume=102|issue=4|pages=316–9|pmid=14914373}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In '''[[stereotactic surgery|stereotactic radiosurgery]]''' ('''SRS'''), the word "stereotactic" refers to a three-dimensional [[coordinate system]] that enables accurate correlation of a virtual target seen in the patient's diagnostic images with the actual target position in the patient.

When used outside the CNS it may be called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR).&lt;ref name=SBRT/&gt;

Technological improvements in medical imaging and computing have led to increased clinical adoption of stereotactic radiosurgery and have broadened its scope in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=De Salles|first=A|title=Radiosurgery from the brain to the spine: 20 years experience|journal=Acta Neurochirurgica. Supplement |year=2008|volume=101|pages=163–168|pmid=18642653|doi=10.1007/978-3-211-78205-7_28|series=Acta Neurochirurgica Supplementum|isbn=978-3-211-78204-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Timmerman|first=Robert|title=Excessive toxicity when treating central tumors in a phase II study of stereotactic body radiation therapy for medically inoperable early-stage lung cancer|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|year=2006|volume=24|issue=30|pages=4833–9|doi=10.1200/JCO.2006.07.5937|pmid=17050868}}&lt;/ref&gt; The localization accuracy and precision that are implicit in the word "stereotactic" remain of utmost importance for radiosurgical interventions.  
In the 21st century the original concept of radiosurgery  expanded to include treatments comprising up to five fractions, and stereotactic radiosurgery has been redefined as a distinct neurosurgical discipline that utilizes externally generated ionizing radiation to inactivate or eradicate defined targets, typically in the head or spine, without the need for a surgical incision.&lt;ref name=barnett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnett|first=Gene H.|title=Stereotactic radiosurgery-an organized neurosurgery-sanctioned definition|journal=Journal of Neurosurgery|year=2007|volume=106|issue=1|pages=1–5|doi=10.3171/jns.2007.106.1.1|pmid=17240553}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Irrespective of the similarities between the concepts of stereotactic radiosurgery and [[Dose fractionation|fractionated]] radiotherapy the intent of both approaches is fundamentally different, although both treatment modalities are reported to have identical outcomes for certain indications.&lt;ref name=combs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Combs|first=Stephanie|title=Differences in clinical results after LINAC-based single-dose radiosurgery versus fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with vestibular schwannomas|journal=International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics|year=2010|volume=76|issue=1|pages=193–200|doi=10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.01.064|pmid=19604653}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of stereotactic radiosurgery is to destroy target tissue while preserving adjacent normal tissue, where fractionated radiotherapy relies on a different sensitivity of the target and the surrounding normal tissue to the [[Absorbed dose|total accumulated radiation dose]].&lt;ref name=barnett/&gt; Historically, the field of fractionated radiotherapy evolved from the original concept of stereotactic radiosurgery following discovery of the principles of [[radiobiology]]: repair, reassortment, repopulation, and reoxygenation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernier|first=Jacques|title=Radiation oncology: a century of achievements|journal=Nature Reviews. Cancer|year=2004|volume=4|issue=9|pages=737–747|doi=10.1038/nrc1451|pmid=15343280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, both treatment techniques are complementary, as tumors that may be resistant to fractionated radiotherapy may respond well to radiosurgery, and tumors that are too large or too close to critical organs for safe radiosurgery may be suitable candidates for fractionated radiotherapy.&lt;ref name=combs /&gt;

==History==
Stereotactic radiosurgery was first developed in 1949 by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell to treat small targets in the brain that were not amenable to conventional surgery. The initial stereotactic instrument he conceived used probes and electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leksell|first=Lars|title=A stereotaxic apparatus for intracerebral surgery|journal=Acta Chirurgica Scandinavica|year=1949|volume=99|pages=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempt to supplant the electrodes with radiation was made in the early fifties, with [[x-ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leksell|first=Lars|title=The stereotaxic method and radiosurgery of the brain|journal=Acta Chirurgica Scandinavica|date=December 1951|volume=102|issue=4|pages=316–9|pmid=14914373}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of this instrument was to hit the intra-cranial target with narrow beams of radiation from multiple directions. The beam paths converge in the target volume, delivering a lethal cumulative dose of radiation there, while limiting the dose to the adjacent healthy tissue. Ten years later significant progress had been made, due in considerable measure to the contribution of the physicists Kurt Liden and Börje Larsson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsson|first=Borje|title=The high-energy proton beam as a neurosurgical tool|journal=Nature|year=1958|volume=182|issue=4644|pages=1222–3|pmid=13590280|doi=10.1038/1821222a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time, stereotactic [[proton]] beams had replaced the x-rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leksell|first=Lars|title=Lesions in the depth of the brain produced by a beam of high energy protons|journal=Acta Radiologica|date=October 1960|volume=54|issue=4|pages=251–64|pmid=13760648|doi=10.3109/00016926009172547}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy particle beam presented as an excellent replacement for the surgical knife, but the [[synchrocyclotron]] was too clumsy. Leksell proceeded to develop a practical, compact, precise and simple tool which could be handled by the surgeon himself. In 1968 this resulted in the Gamma Knife, which was installed at the [[Karolinska Institutet|Karolinska Institute]] and consisted of several [[cobalt-60]] [[radioactivity|radioactive]] sources placed in a kind of helmet with central channels for irradiation with gamma rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leksell|first=Lars|title=Stereotactic Radiosurgery|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry|date=September 1983|volume=46|issue=9|pages=797–803|pmid=6352865|doi=10.1136/jnnp.46.9.797|pmc=1027560}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prototype was designed to produce slit-like radiation lesions for functional neurosurgical procedures to treat pain, movement disorders, or behavioral disorders that did not respond to conventional treatment. The success of this first unit led to the construction of a second device, containing 179 cobalt-60 sources. This second Gamma Knife unit was designed to produce spherical lesions to treat brain tumors and intracranial [[arteriovenous malformation]]s (AVMs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=Andrew|title=Physics of Gamma Knife approach on convergent beams in stereotactic radiosurgery|journal=International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics|date=April 1990|volume=18|issue=4|pages=941–949|doi=10.1016/0360-3016(90)90421-f}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s the third and fourth units (with 201 cobalt-60 sources) were installed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Sheffield, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walton|first=L|title=The Sheffield stereotactic radiosurgery unit: physical characteristics and principles of operation|journal=British Journal of Radiology|year=1987|volume=60|issue=717|pages=897–906|doi=10.1259/0007-1285-60-717-897|pmid=3311273}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth Gamma Knife was installed at the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1987.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In parallel to these developments, a similar approach was designed for a [[linear particle accelerator]] or Linac. Installation of the first 4&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]] clinical linear accelerator began in June 1952 in the Medical Research Council (MRC) Radiotherapeutic Research Unit at the [[Hammersmith Hospital]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fry|first=D.W.|title=A traveling wave linear accelerator for 4 MeV electrons|journal=Nature|year=1948|volume=162|pages=859–61|pmid=18103121|issue=4126|doi=10.1038/162859a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was handed over for physics and other testing in February 1953 and began to treat patients on 7 September that year. Meanwhile, work at the Stanford Microwave Laboratory led to the development of a 6-MV accelerator, which was installed at Stanford University Hospital, California, in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernier|first=J|title=Radiation oncology: a century of achievements|journal=Nature Reviews.

Today, both Gamma Knife and Linac radiosurgery programs are commercially available worldwide. While the Gamma Knife is dedicated to radiosurgery, most Linacs are built for conventional fractionated radiotherapy and require additional technology and expertise to become dedicated radiosurgery tools. This is exemplified by the [http://www.novalistxradiosurgery.com Novalis Radiosurgery Program], designed to complement conventional Linacs with sophisticated beam-shaping technology, treatment planning,  and image-guidance tools to provide highest treatment accuracy. An example of a dedicated radiosurgery Linac is the [[CyberKnife]], a compact Linac mounted onto a robotic arm that moves around the patient and irradiates the tumor from a large set of fixed positions, thereby mimicking the Gamma Knife concept.

==Clinical applications==
When used outside the CNS it may be called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR).&lt;ref name=SBRT&gt;[http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/treatment/radiotherapy/external/stereotactic-body-radiotherapy-sabr Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central nervous system===
Radiosurgery is performed by a multidisciplinary team of [[neurosurgeons]], [[radiation oncologist]]s and medical [[physicist]]s to operate and maintain highly sophisticated, highly precise and complex instruments, including medical linear accelerators, the Gamma Knife unit and the Cyberknife unit. The highly precise irradiation of targets within the brain and spine is planned using information from medical images that are obtained via [[computed tomography]], [[magnetic resonance imaging]], and [[angiography]].

Radiosurgery is indicated primarily for the therapy of tumors, vascular lesions and functional disorders.  Significant clinical judgment must be used with this technique and considerations must include lesion type, pathology if available, size, location and age and general health of the patient.  General contraindications to radiosurgery include excessively large size of the target lesion, or lesions too numerous for practical treatment. Patients can be treated within one to five days as [[outpatient]]s. By comparison, the average hospital stay for a [[craniotomy]] (conventional neurosurgery, requiring the opening of the skull) is about 15 days. The radiosurgery outcome may not be evident until months after the treatment. Since radiosurgery does not remove the tumor but inactivates it biologically, lack of growth of the lesion is normally considered to be treatment success. General indications for radiosurgery include many kinds of brain tumors, such as [[acoustic neuroma]]s, [[germinoma]]s, [[meningioma]]s, [[metastases]], trigeminal neuralgia, arteriovenous malformations, and skull base tumors, among others. Expansion of stereotactic radiotherapy to extracranial lesions is increasing, and includes metastases, liver cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc.

===Mechanism of action===
[[Image:Acoustic schwannoma gamma knife.jpg|right|thumb|Planning [[CT scan]] with IV contrast in a patient with left cerebellopontine angle [[vestibular schwannoma]]]]
The fundamental principle of radiosurgery is that of selective [[ionization]] of tissue, by means of high-energy beams of radiation. Ionization is the production of [[ion]]s and [[free radicals]] which are damaging to the [[cell (biology)|cells]]. These ions and radicals, which may be formed from the water in the cell or biological materials, can produce irreparable damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, resulting in the cell's death. Thus, biological inactivation is carried out in a volume of tissue to be treated, with a precise destructive effect. The radiation dose is usually measured in [[Gray (unit)|grays]] (one gray (Gy) is the absorption of one [[joule]] of energy per kilogram of mass). A unit that attempts to take into account both the different organs that are irradiated and the type of radiation is the [[sievert]], a unit that describes both the amount of energy deposited and the biological effectiveness.

===Risks===
''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in December 2010 that radiation overdoses had occurred with the linear accelerator method of radiosurgery, due in large part to inadequate safeguards in equipment retrofitted for stereotactic radiosurgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/health/29radiation.html | title = A Pinpoint Beam Strays Invisibly, Harming Instead of Healing | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2010-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates these devices, whereas the Gamma Knife is regulated by the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]. The ''NYT'' article focused on [[Varian Medical Systems|Varian]] equipment and associated software, but the problem is likely not to be limited to that manufacturer.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

This is evidence that [[Cancer immunotherapy|immunotherapy]] may be useful for treatment of radiation necrosis following stereotactic radiotherapy.&lt;ref name="pmid28368903"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaidar-Person O, Zagar TM, Deal A, Moschos SJ, Ewend MG, Sasaki-Adams D, Lee CB, Collichio FA, Fried D, Marks LB, Chera BS |title=The incidence of radiation necrosis following stereotactic radiotherapy for melanoma brain metastases: the potential impact of immunotherapy |journal=Anticancer Drugs |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=669–675 |date=July 2017 |pmid=28368903 |doi=10.1097/CAD.0000000000000497 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of radiation source ==
The selection of the proper kind of radiation and device depends on many factors including lesion type, size, and location in relation to critical structures.  Data suggest that similar clinical outcomes are possible with all of the various techniques.  More important than the device used are issues regarding indications for treatment, total dose delivered, fractionation schedule and conformity of the treatment plan.

=== Gamma Knife ===
{{redirect|Gamma Knife|the album by Kayo Dot|Gamma Knife (album)}}
[[Image:Gamma Knife Graphic.jpg|thumb|[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]] graphic of the Leksell Gamma Knife]]
Gamma knife using Gamma radiation to treat the tumor cells especially in brain.
The Gamma Knife (also known as the Leksell Gamma Knife), a creation of [[Elekta|Elekta AB]], a Swedish public company, is used to treat [[brain tumors]] by administering high-intensity gamma radiation therapy in a manner that concentrates the radiation over a small volume. The device was invented in 1967 at the Karolinska Institute in [[Stockholm]], Sweden by Lars Leksell, Romanian-born neurosurgeon Ladislau Steiner, and [[radiobiologist]] Börje Larsson from [[Uppsala University]], Sweden. The first Gamma Knife was brought to the United States through an arrangement between US neurosurgeon [[Robert Wheeler Rand]] and Leksell and was given to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1979.

A Gamma Knife typically contains 201 [[cobalt-60]] sources of approximately 30&amp;nbsp;[[curie]]s (1.1&amp;nbsp;[[terabecquerel|TBq]]), each placed in a hemispheric array in a heavily [[Radiation protection|shielded]] assembly. The device aims [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] through a target point in the patient's brain.  The patient wears a specialized helmet that is surgically fixed to the skull, so that the brain tumor remains stationary at the target point of the gamma rays. An [[ablation|ablative]] dose of radiation is thereby sent through the tumor in one treatment session, while surrounding brain tissues are relatively spared.

Gamma Knife therapy, like all radiosurgery, uses doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors, delivered precisely to avoid damaging healthy brain tissue. Gamma Knife radiosurgery is able to accurately focus many beams of gamma radiation on one or more tumors. Each individual beam is of relatively low intensity, so the radiation has little effect on intervening brain tissue and is concentrated only at the tumor itself.

Gamma Knife radiosurgery has proven effective for patients with benign or malignant brain tumors up to {{cvt|4|cm|in}} in size, [[Blood vessel|vascular]] malformations such as an [[arteriovenous malformation]] (AVM), pain, and other functional problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Régis J, Bartolomei F, Hayashi M, Chauvel P |title=What role for radiosurgery in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy |journal=Zentralbl.

=== Linear accelerator-based therapies ===
{{main|Megavoltage X-rays}}

A linear accelerator (linac) produces x-rays from the impact of accelerated electrons striking a high ''z'' target (usually tungsten).  A Linac therefore can generate x-rays of any energy, though usually 6&amp;nbsp;MV photons are used.  With a Linac the gantry moves in space to change the delivery angle. Linear accelerator equipment can also move the patient lying on the treatment couch to change the delivery point.  These treatments involve using a stereotactic frame to restrict the patient's movement. The Novalis Shaped Beam Radiosurgery system and Tx Radiosurgery platform, from Brainlab, implement a frameless, non-invasive technique with X-ray imaging that has proven to be both comfortable for the patient and accurate. The Trilogy from Varian, or CyberKnife from Accuray, can also be used with non-invasive immobilization devices coupled with real-time imaging to detect any patient motion during a treatment.

Linear accelerators emit high energy X-rays; the process is usually referred to as "X-ray therapy" or "photon therapy." The term "gamma ray" is usually reserved for photons that are emitted from a radioisotope such as cobalt-60 (see below). Such radiation is not substantially different from that emitted by high voltage accelerators. In linear accelerator therapy, the emission head (called "[[Gantry crane|gantry]]") is mechanically rotated around the patient, in a full or partial circle. The table where the patient is lying, the "couch", can also be moved in small linear or angular steps. The combination of the movements of the gantry and of the couch makes possible the computerized planning of the volume of tissue that is going to be irradiated. Devices with a high energy of 6&amp;nbsp;MeV are the most suitable for the treatment of the brain, due to the depth of the target. The diameter of the energy beam leaving the emission head can be adjusted to the size of the lesion by means of [[collimator]]s. They may be interchangeable orifices with different diameters, typically varying from 5 to 40&amp;nbsp;mm in 5&amp;nbsp;mm steps, or multileaf collimators, which consist of a number of metal leaflets that can be moved dynamically during treatment in order to shape the radiation beam to conform to the mass to be ablated. {{As of|2017}} Linacs are capable of achieving extremely narrow beam geometries, such as 0.15 to 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm. Therefore, they can be used for several kinds of surgeries which hitherto had been carried out by open or endoscopic surgery, such as for trigeminal neuralgia, etc. The exact mechanism of its effectiveness for trigeminal neuralgia is not known; however, its use for this purpose has become very common. Long-term follow-up data has shown it to be as effective as radiofrequency ablation, but inferior to surgery in preventing the recurrence of pain.

A type of linear accelerator therapy which uses a small accelerator mounted on a moving arm to deliver X-rays to a very small area which can be seen on fluoroscopy, is called Cyberknife therapy. Several generations of the frameless robotic Cyberknife system have been developed since its initial inception in 1990. It was invented by [[John R. Adler]], a [[Stanford University]] professor of neurosurgery and radiation oncology, and Russell and Peter Schonberg at Schonberg Research, and is sold by the Accuray company, located in [[Sunnyvale, California]], US. Many such CyberKnife systems are available worldwide.

Cyberknife may be compared to Gamma Knife therapy (see above), but it does not use gamma rays emitted by radioisotopes. It also does not use a frame to hold the patient, as a computer monitors the patient's position during treatment, using [[fluoroscopy]]. The robotic concept of Cyberknife radiosurgery allows the tumor to be tracked, rather than fixing the patient with a stereotaxic frame. Since no frame is needed, some of the radiosurgical concepts can be extended to treat extracranial tumors. In this case, the Cyberknife robotic arm tracks the tumor motion (i.e. respiratory motion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schweikard Achim |author2=Shiomi Hiroya |author3=Adler John | year = 2004 | title = Respiration tracking in radiosurgery | url = | journal = Medical Physics | volume = 31 | issue = 10| pages = 2738–2741 | pmid = 15543778 | doi=10.1118/1.1774132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A combination of stereo x-ray imaging and infrared tracking sensors determines the tumor position in real time.

=== Proton beam therapy ===
{{main|Proton therapy}}

Protons may also be used in radiosurgery in a procedure called '''Proton Beam Therapy''' (PBT) or [[proton therapy]]. Protons are extracted from proton donor materials by a medical [[synchrotron]] or [[cyclotron]], and accelerated in successive transits through a circular, evacuated conduit or cavity, using powerful magnets to shape their path, until they reach the energy required to just traverse a human body, usually about 200&amp;nbsp;MeV. They are then released toward the region to be treated in the patient's body, the irradiation target. In some machines, which deliver protons of only a specific energy, a custom mask made of plastic is interposed between the beam source and the patient to adjust the beam energy to provide the appropriate degree of penetration. The phenomenon of the [[Bragg peak]] of ejected protons gives proton therapy advantages over other forms of radiation, since most of the proton's energy is deposited within a limited distance, so tissue beyond this range (and to some extent also tissue inside this range) is spared from the effects of radiation. This property of protons, which has been called the "[[depth charge]] effect" by analogy to the explosive weapons used in anti-submarine warfare, allows for conformal dose distributions to be created around even very irregularly shaped targets, and for higher doses to targets surrounded or backstopped by radiation-sensitive structures such as the [[optic chiasm]] or brainstem. The development of "intensity modulated" techniques allowed similar conformities to be attained using linear accelerator radiosurgery.

{{As of|2013}} there was no evidence that proton therapy is better than any other types of treatment in most cases, except for a "handful of rare pediatric cancers". Critics, responding to the increasing number of very expensive PBT installations, spoke of a "medical [[arms race]]"  and "crazy medicine and unsustainable public policy".&lt;ref name="medscape.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/778466 |title=Uncertainty About Proton-Beam Radiotherapy Lingers |website=Medscape|date=30 January 2013  |author=Roxanne Nelson |accessdate= 22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans William and [[Frederick Langenheim]] introduced stereopticon slide technology—slide shows of projected images on glass—in 1850.  For a usual fee of ten cents, people could view realistic images of nature, history, and science themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.magiclanternsociety.org/about-magic-lanterns/lantern-slides/|title=Lantern Slides {{!}} Magic Lantern Society|website=www.magiclanternsociety.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two lenses are used to dissolve between images when projected. At first, the shows used random images, but over time, lanternists began to place the slides in logical order, creating a narrative.  This "visual storytelling" with technology directly preceded the development of the first moving pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term stereopticon has been widely misused to name a [[stereoscope]]. A stereopticon will not project or display stereoscopic/[[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] images on cards. All stereopticons can be classified as [[Magic lantern|magic lanterns]], but not all magic lanterns are stereopticons.

In 1985 Strozzi-Heckler contributed to a [[pilot program]] for the [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] to evaluate [[Mind-body connection|mind-body]] approaches to [[Military education and training|military training]]. In addition to many of the measured outcomes related to increased [[endurance]], [[alertness]], capacity for [[stress management]], and [[Sports psychology#Team dynamics|team cohesion]], participants unexpectedly demonstrated significant increases in leadership characteristics.  Reflecting on this, Strozzi-Heckler began exploring ways to adapt the program for leaders in business and government.&lt;ref name="dance"/&gt;In collaboration with [[Fernando Flores]] during the 1980s and 1990s, Flores's Ontology of Language research into [[speech act#In computer science|speech acts]] was integrated and applied to the somatic leadership domain. &lt;ref&gt; Wildflower, L., "The Hidden History of Coaching" McGraw-Hill Education (2013) {{ISBN|978-0335245406}} p.66 https://books.google.com/books?id=IKGSyKsY-hkC&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Strozzi Institute introduced a training program for [[coaching|coaches]] interested in their somatic approach.

==Strozzi Somatics==
The Strozzi Institute methodology, known as Strozzi Somatics, is used one-on-one and in groups of varying size.

The Strozzi Somatics [[methodology]] makes a distinction between ''soma'' - the living body in its entirety, and the mechanistic view of the physical body as an assemblage of anatomical parts.  Using this first definition the body is regarded as the primary domain of feeling, action, language, and meaning.&lt;ref name="jasp"&gt;Strean, W.B., Strozzi-Heckler, R., "(The) Body (of) Knowledge: Somatic Contributions to the Practice of Sport Psychology" ''Journal of Sports Psychology'', September 2009 p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, coaches observe the ways people hold their bodies and how they respond to stress situations, such as verbal or physical surprises.  The body’s overall organization in this way is referred to as a somatic shape.&lt;ref name="keleman"&gt;Keleman, S., ''Emotional Anatomy''.  Center Press (1985) {{ISBN|978-0-934320-07-8}}  p.103&lt;/ref&gt; Each person’s unique somatic shape is formed by responses to past experiences, positive and negative, which are established as deep, mostly unconscious patterns of muscular activity in the body. Over time these patterns produce conditioned tendencies of reaction to people, situations and environments.&lt;ref name="fem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-harrow/reclaiming-feminine-value_b_409615.html |title=Susan Harrow: Reclaiming Feminine Values and Virtues in the Workplace and Home |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2010-01-04 |accessdate=2012-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strozzi-Heckler has described the process in which, when an individual is exposed to a stressful stimulus, they revert to this conditioned tendency, limiting their available choices for action.&lt;ref name="AofC"&gt;Strozzi-Heckler, R., ''Anatomy of Change: A Way to Move Through Life's Transitions''. North Atlantic Books (1997) {{ISBN|978-1-55643-147-0}} p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Withdrawal, fear, attempting to dominate, rigidity, and over-accommodation are examples of different conditioned tendency shapes.&lt;ref name="dance"/&gt;  Because this is a [[Somatics|somatic]] event rather than an exclusively [[Cognition|cognitive]] one, new information or theoretical insight will not shift the response.  As an illustration, he describes a team leader who has extensive education in management principles but, especially under stress, comports himself in a way that produces mistrust and resentment from the people he manages, eventually creating significant breakdowns within his team.&lt;ref name="dojo"&gt;Strozzi-Heckler, R., ''The Leadership Dojo''. Frog Books (2007) {{ISBN|978-1-58394-201-7}} pp. 27-32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership ===
Strozzi Institute has stressed that leadership characteristics often considered innate are teachable, and can be improved with practice. These traits include: high [[self awareness#In psychology|self awareness]] and awareness of the environment, being open to possibilities rather than limited to past options, being motivated by a connection to what one cares about,
the ability to deal directly with matters that need attention,
directing attention outward in a way that enables listening and connection with others,
and the ability to coordinate with others and empathize with their concerns.
&lt;ref name="voxam"&gt;Interview with Strozzi-Heckler http://www.voiceamerica.com/episode/26740/the-body-of-leadership 6:50 - 11:48, 19:20 - 20:05&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aikido Influence===
Many of the practices taught are adapted from [[aikido]] and different forms of [[meditation]].
Aikido movements are presented in a non-[[martial arts|martial]] context and principles of the art such as:
''centering'' oneself, ''facing'' an attack, ''extending'' outward into the environment, ''entering'' into shared space, and ''blending'' with the momentum of an incursion, are used as physical metaphors to guide the practice of embodying leadership characteristics.&lt;ref name="dance"/&gt;
An aikido [[dojo]], ''Two Rock Aikido'', is located on the Strozzi Institute site in Sonoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tworockaikido.com |title=Two Rock Aikido, Petaluma - California |publisher=Tworockaikido.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strozzi Bodywork===
Working from the premise that the body and the [[self]] are indistinguishable from one another, Strozzi Institute offers training in a style of [[bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]] developed by Strozzi-Heckler and Hall to produce change in a person's core historical limitations.   Strozzi Bodywork involves addressing deeply held muscular contractions (also known as [[character armor|armoring]]) maintained in the soma using touch, breath, and directed attention. Practitioners train to develop an [[empathy|empathetic]], compassionate presence that can build trust and enable them to work with others through a variety of [[emotion]]al states. Some somatic coaches use Strozzi Bodywork in their coaching sessions.

===Applications===
The Strozzi Somatics methodology has been applied to a broad range of organizations and with diverse populations. These include Fortune 50 companies, [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]], [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]], [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]], [[social justice]] groups, professional sports teams, as well as urban gang members, [[prisoner]]s, Olympic athletes,&lt;ref name="dance"/&gt; and survivors of sexual trauma.&lt;ref name="heal"&gt;Haines, S., ''Healing Sex: A Mind-Body Approach to Healing Sexual Trauma'' Cleis (2007) {{ISBN|978-1-57344-293-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strozzi Institute has contributed to U.S. Military [[counter-insurgency]] training, integrating somatic practices to enhance soldiers' abilities to connect with others across cultures rather than rely predominantly on force.  Strozzi-Heckler has said, "Working with the body gives you a way to do that because it transcends words and language. It takes us to that common core of being human."&lt;ref name="dance"&gt;Helgesen, S. “The Dance of Power” ''Strategy+Business'', Winter 2007/Issue 49, http://www.strategy-business.com/article/07406?gko=c0c2d&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Symmetry breaking of escaping ants''' is a phenomenon that happens when [[ant]]s are constrained into a cell with two equivalent exits, and perturbed with an [[insect repellent]]. Contrary to intuition, ants tend to use one door more than the other on average (i.e., there is a  [[symmetry breaking]] in the escape behavior), so they crowd on one of the doors, which decreases the evacuation efficiency.

==Description==

The [[symmetry breaking]] phenomenon arises in experiments described as follows. Worker ants freshly collected from the field are enclosed into a circular cell with a glass cover in such a way that they can only move in two dimensions (i.e., ants cannot pass over each other). The cell has two exits located symmetrically relative to its center. We will describe first a "reference" experiment, and then the one where the "escape [[symmetry]]" is broken.

In the reference experiment, both doors are opened at the same time and let the ants escape. If the experiment is realized many times, in average we see that approximately the same number of ants use the left and the right doors. In this experiment the escape symmetry is not broken.

The second experiment involves a further step before opening the doors: an [[insect repellent]] fluid is poured into the cell at its center through a small hole in the glass cover. As a result, ants get very excited. If the experiment is realized many times, we see that the number of ants escaping by one of the doors (which can be randomly either the left one or the right ones) is significantly higher than the number of ants escaping by the other one, i.e., the escape symmetry is broken. The crowding of ants at one of the doors while the other one may be eventually free results in an inefficient evacuation in terms of time.

Geng Li and coworkers from Beijing Normal University tested whether and how the density of a group influenced symmetry breaking in escaping ants. They used the [[red imported fire ant]] (''Solenopsis invicta'') to repeat the experiment mentioned above with different total number of ants. The result shows that the symmetry breaking increases at low density but decreases after a peak. That is to say, when density is low, the ant group produces a collective escaping behavior; while at high density, the ant group behaves more like random particles.&lt;ref name="Li et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = G. | last2 = Huan | first2 = D. | last3 = Roehner | first3 = B. | last4 = Xu | first4 = Y.

== History==

Inspired by earlier computer simulations that predicted a symmetry breaking phenomenon when panicked humans escape from a room with two equivalent exits, E. Altshuler and coworkers from the [[University of Havana]] designed the experiment described in the section above, which revealed the symmetry breaking effect in the leaf-cutting ant ''[[Atta insularis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=E. Altshuler|title=Symmetry breaking in escaping ants|journal=American Naturalist|year=2005 |jstor=498139|doi=10.1086/498139|pmid=16475081|volume=166|issue=6|pages=643–649|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ant ''Atta insularis'' (commonly called ''bibijagua'' in Cuba) displays a high degree of [[swarm intelligence]], like most social insects, which has made them great survivors through millions of years of [[evolution]]. In Cuba, a person may be described as "smarter than ''bibijaguas''" (''"sabe mas que las bibijaguas"''). The poor evacuation efficiency illustrated by the phenomenon of symmetry breaking in escaping ants is one of the few examples where bibijaguas do not seem to behave collectively in a smart way.

==Explanations==

The basic idea is that the action of the repellent induces [[herd behavior]] in the ants. When ants are in "panic", they experience a strong tendency to follow each other. As a result, if a random fluctuation in the system produces a locally large amount of ants trying to reach one of the two doors, the fluctuation can be amplified because ants tend to follow the direction of the majority of individuals. Then, that specific door becomes crowded.

E. Altshuler and coworkers were able to reproduce their symmetry breaking experiments in ants using a simplified version of the theoretical model proposed earlier by Helbing et al. for humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Helbing.|title= Simulating dynamical features of escape panic|journal=Nature|year=2000 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6803/full/407487a0.html|volume=407|issue=6803|pages=487–90|doi=10.1038/35035023|pmid=11028994|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the fact that walkers tend to follow the general direction of motion of their neighbors ("[[Vicsek's rule]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=T. Vicsek|title= A new type of phase transition in a system of self-driven particles|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |year=1995 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1226|bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.1226V|volume=75|issue=6|pages=1226–1229|pmid=10060237|display-authors=etal|arxiv=cond-mat/0611743}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and such herd behavior increases as the so-called "panic parameter" increases. In the case of ants, the panic parameter is supposed to be low when no repellent is used, and high when the repellent is used.

A more "biologically-sensible" model based on the deposition of an alarm [[pheromone]] by ants under stress also reproduces the symmetry breaking phenomenon, with the advantage that it also predicts the experimental output for different concentrations of ants in the cell.&lt;ref name="Li et al" /&gt;

The pheromone mechanism shares the key element of the previous models: stressed ants tend to "follow the crowd".

==Ants vs. humans escaping in panic==
From the statistical point of view, human beings and ants seem to behave in a similar way in certain scenarios, such as evacuation from a room or cell under stress, resulting in symmetry breaking phenomena: while ants increase their tendency to follow each other under stress, human beings seem to forget about [[Emergency evacuation]] strategies, and  just run towards the door where most people run to. However, the enormous physical and behavioural differences between humans and ants imply also big differences in their [[collective behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. Detrain and J.-L. Deneubourg|title=Self-organized structures in a super-organism: do ants "behave" like molecules?|journal=Physics of Life Reviews |year=2006 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571064506000200|doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2006.07.001|volume=3|issue=3|pages=162–187|bibcode=2006PhLRv...3..162D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S. Boari|title=Efficient egress of escaping ants stressed with temperature|journal=PLOS ONE |volume=8|issue=11|pages=e81082|year=2014 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0081082&amp;representation=PDF|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0081082|pmid=24312264|pmc=3843683|bibcode=2013PLoSO...881082B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the symmetry breaking experiment on ants, for example, the individuals are relatively "polite": rarely ants are crushed by other ants in the process or evacuation. When humans are in panic, however, deaths by overpressure or suffocation are common, like in the case of the [[Love Parade disaster]] occurred in [[Germany]] in 2010.

'''Terrain Contour Matching''', or '''TERCOM''', is a navigation system used primarily by [[cruise missile]]s. It uses a pre-recorded [[Contour line|contour map]] of the terrain that is compared with measurements made during flight by an on-board [[radar altimeter]]. A TERCOM system considerably increases the accuracy of a missile compared with [[inertial navigation system]]s (INS). The increased accuracy allows a TERCOM-equipped missile to fly closer to obstacles and generally lower altitudes, making it harder to detect by ground radar.

== Description ==
{{See also|Digital elevation model}}

===Optical contour matching===
The [[Goodyear Aerospace|Goodyear Aircraft Corporation]] ATRAN (Automatic Terrain Recognition And Navigation) system for the [[MGM-13 Mace]] was the earliest known TERCOM system. In August 1952, [[Air Materiel Command]] initiated the mating of the Goodyear ATRAN with the [[MGM-1 Matador]].  This mating resulted in a production contract in June 1954. ATRAN was difficult to jam and was not range-limited by line-of sight, but its range was restricted by the availability of radar maps. In time, it became possible to construct radar maps from [[topographic map]]s.

Preparation of the maps required the route to be flown by an aircraft. A [[radar]] on the aircraft was set to a fixed angle and made horizontal scans of the land in front. The timing of the return signal indicated the range to the landform and produced an [[amplitude modulated]] (AM) signal. This was sent to a light source and recorded on [[35 mm film]], advancing the film and taking a picture at indicated times. The film could then be processed and copied for use in multiple missiles.

In the missile, a similar radar produced the same signal. A second system scanned the frames of film against a [[photocell]] and produced a similar AM signal. By comparing the points along the scan where the brightness changed rapidly, which could be picked out easily by simple electronics, the system could compare the left-right path of the missile compared with that of the pathfinding aircraft. Errors between the two signals drove corrections in the autopilot needed to bring the missile back onto its programmed flight path.

===Altitude matching===
Modern TERCOM systems use a different concept, based on the altitude of the ground the missile files over and comparing that to measurements made by a radar altimeter. TERCOM "maps" consist of a series of squares of a given size. Using a smaller number of squares saves memory, at the cost of decreasing accuracy. A series of such maps are produced, typically from data from radar mapping satellites. When flying over water, contour maps are replaced by magnetic field maps.

As a radar altimeter measures the distance between the missile and the terrain, not the absolute altitude, the important measure in the data is the change in altitude from square to square. The missile's radar altimeter feeds measurements into a small buffer which periodically "gates" the measurements over a period of time and averages them out to produce a single measurement. The series of such numbers held in the buffer produce a strip of measurements similar to those held in the maps. The series of changes in the buffer is then compared with the values in the map, looking for areas where the changes in altitude are identical. This produces a location and direction. The guidance system can then use this information to correct the flight path of the missile. 

During the flight to the target the accuracy of the system has to be enough only to avoid terrain features. This allows the maps to be relatively low resolution in these areas. Only the portion of the map for the terminal approach has to be higher resolution, and would normally be encoded at the highest resolutions available to the satellite mapping system.

=== TAINS ===

Due to the limited amount of memory available in mass storage devices of the 1960s and 70s, and their slow access times, the amount of terrain data that could be stored in a missile-sized package was far too small to encompass the entire flight. Instead, small patches of terrain information were stored and periodically used to update a conventional [[inertial platform]]. These systems, combining TERCOM and inertial navigation, are sometimes known as '''TAINS''', for TERCOM-Aided Inertial Navigation System.

=== Advantages ===

TERCOM systems have the advantage of offering accuracy that is not based on the length of the flight; an inertial system slowly drifts after a "fix", and its accuracy is lower for longer distances. TERCOM systems receive constant fixes during the flight, and thus do not have any drift. Their absolute accuracy, however, is based on the accuracy of the radar mapping information, which is typically in the range of meters, and the ability of the processor to compare the altimeter data to the map quickly enough as the resolution increases. This generally limits first generation TERCOM systems to targets on the order of hundreds of meters, limiting them to the use of [[nuclear warhead]]s. Use of conventional warheads requires further accuracy, which in turn demands additional terminal guidance systems.

=== Disadvantages ===

One disadvantage of early TERCOM systems was that, due to the limitations of storage and computing systems of the time, the entire route had to be pre-planned, including its launch point. If the missile was launched from an unexpected location or flew too far off-course, it would never fly over the features included in the maps, and become lost. The INS system can help in this regard, allowing it to fly to the general area of the first patch, but gross errors simply cannot be corrected. This made early TERCOM based systems much less flexible than more modern systems like [[GPS]], which can be set to attack any location from any location, and do not require any sort of pre-recorded information which means they can be targeted immediately prior to launch.

The availability of compact fast computers and high-capacity storage, combined with the availability of global [[digital elevation map]]s, has mitigated this problem, as TERCOM data is no longer limited to small patches, and the availability of [[side-looking radar]] allows much larger areas of landscape contour data to be acquired for comparison with the stored contour data.

== Comparison with other guidance systems ==
=== DSMAC ===
{{See also|Automatic target recognition}}
Early cruise missiles did not have the mapping satellites to draw information from, and there were plans to use a TERCOM-like system based on photographs rather than elevations. A series of photographs taken from surveillance aircraft were put into a carousel in the missile, which were selected at timed intervals and imaged using a television camera. Another camera took pictures out of the bottom of the missile, imaged onto a similar display. A computer compared the two displays and attempted to line up areas of high contrast, similar to the [[contrast seeker]]s used in the [[Maverick missile]], and the offsets needed to align the two images could be decoded into a location and heading. However, this system proved to be very slow, and no such system was ever employed operationally, its role being taken up by TERCOM.

The massive improvements in memory and processing power from the 1950s when these scene comparison systems were first invented to the 1980s when TERCOM was widely deployed changed the nature of the problem considerably. Modern systems can store numerous images of a target as seen from different directions, and often the imagery can be calculated using image synthesis techniques. Likewise, the complexity of the live imaging systems has been greatly reduced through the introduction of solid-state technologies like [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]]. The combination of these technologies produced the '''Digitized Scene-Mapping Area Correlator (DSMAC)'''. DSMAC systems are often combined with TERCOM as a terminal guidance system, allowing point attack with conventional warheads.
{{Main article|Radar imaging}}
MGM-31 [[Pershing II]], [[SS-12 Scaleboard]] Temp-SM and [[OTR-23 Oka]] used an [[active radar homing]] version of DSMAC (digitized correlator unit DCU), which compared radar [[topographic map]]s taken by satellites or aircraft with information received from the onboard active radar regarding target topography, for terminal guidance.

=== Satellite navigation ===
Yet another way to navigate a cruise missile is by using a '''[[satellite positioning system]]''', such as [[GPS]] or [[GLONASS]]. Satellite navigation systems are precise and cheap. Unfortunately, they rely on satellites. If the satellites are interfered with (e.g. destroyed) or if the satellite signal is interfered with (e.g. jammed), the satellite navigation system becomes inoperable. Therefore, the GPS-based (or GLONASS-based) navigation is useful in a conflict with a technologically unsophisticated adversary. On the other hand, to be ready for a conflict with a technologically advanced adversary, one needs missiles equipped with TAINS and DSMAC.

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}

'''The Tibet Center''', also known as '''''Kunkhyab Thardo Ling''''', in [[New York City]], is a center for the [[Buddhist studies|study]] of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], a [[dharma center]]. The Tibet Center was founded by Venerable [[Khyongla Rato]] Rinpoche in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Jamyang Centre website {{cite web |url=http://www.jamyang.co.uk/index.php/multimedia/audio-teachings/teachers-k-r?showall=&amp;start=2here |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606214313/http://www.jamyang.co.uk/index.php/multimedia/audio-teachings/teachers-k-r?showall=&amp;start=2here |archivedate=2014-06-06 |df= }} accessed 2014-6-1&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently directed by Khen Rinpoche, [[Nicholas Vreeland]], who is the abbot of [[Rato Dratsang]]. The primary teachers at The Tibet Center are Khyongla Rato Rinpoche, Geshe Nicholas Vreeland, and Anthony Spina.

The Tibet Center, in partnership with the [[Richard Gere|Gere]] Foundation, has invited and hosted the [[14th Dalai Lama]] for six teaching events in NYC since 1991. Numerous other religious teachers, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist, have taught at The Tibet Center.

As well as meeting in downtown [[Manhattan]] on a weekly basis, The Tibet Center has a retreat home in [[New Jersey]].

==Name==
The [[dharma]] name of the center is ''Kunkhyab Thardo Ling'' (translation: Land Pervaded with Seekers of Liberation), a name given to the center by the 6th [[Ling Rinpoche]], who was the 97th [[Gaden Tripa]], and like many of the previous Ling Rinpoches, was the senior tutor of the [[Dalai Lama]].

==Tibet Center teachers==
The Tibet Center has three main teachers: the founder Venerable [[Khyongla Rato]] Rinpoche, who is a Tibetan incarnate lama, Venerable Khen Rinpoche, Geshe Nicholas Vreeland, and Anthony Spina, another one of Khyongla Rinpoche's long-time students.

Over the years many other Tibetan Buddhist teachers have taught at The Tibet Center. As The Tibet Center website explains, these have included, "Venerable Kyabje Ling Rinpoche, the Senior Tutor of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Venerable [[Tsenzhab Serkong Rinpoche|Tsenshab Serkong Rinpoche]], who served as the official debating partner of H. H. the Dalai Lama, [[Sakya Trizin]] Rinpoche, the hereditary head of the [[Sakya]] order of Tibetan Buddhism, Venerable [[Trulshik Rinpoche]] of the [[Nyingma]] tradition, and Venerable [[Tenga Rinpoche]] of the [[Kagyu]] tradition."&lt;ref&gt;The Tibet Center website, History &amp; Mission, [http://thetibetcenter.org/history/] accessed 2014-6-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist teachers from the [[Chinese Chán|Chan]], [[Theravadan]] and [[Zen]] traditions have also taught at The Tibet Center. In addition, teachers from the [[Jain]], [[Hindu]] and [[Christian]] religions, as well as scientists and philosophers, have taught there.&lt;ref name="thetibetcenter.org"&gt;The Tibet Center website, History &amp; Mission, [http://thetibetcenter.org/history/] accessed 2014-5-31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khyongla Rato===
{{Main|Khyongla Rato}}
Khyongla Rinpoche is a Tibetan incarnate lama who was born in Tibet in 1923. He left Tibet in 1959 and has lived in New York (and subsequently in New Jersey) since 1968. Khyongla Rato has taught at the Tibet Center for almost 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Teachings website, Teachers, Lineage Lamas, Lama Zopa Rinpoche's Teachers, Khyongla Rato Rinpoche [http://fpmt.org/teachers/lineage-lamas/khyongla-rinpoche/] Accessed 2014-5-31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geshe Nicholas Vreeland, Khen Rinpoche===
{{Main|Nicholas Vreeland}}
[[File:KhenRinpocheRatoTemple.jpg|thumb|left| Khen Rinpoche Nicholas Vreeland in front of the temple at Rato Dratsang, January 2015]]
[[Geshe]] Nicholas Vreeland, Khen Rinpoche, the current director of The Tibet Center, is the first westerner to be made abbot of a major Tibetan Buddhist monastery, [[Rato Dratsang]], which was re-established in [[Karnataka]], India. Khen Rinpoche holds a Ser Tri [[Geshe]] Degree from Rato. As well as being a fully ordained monk, he is also a photographer. He is the grandson of [[Diana Vreeland]], and is the subject of the biographical documentary film, ''[[Monk with a Camera]]''.

==Dalai Lama events==
Since 1979, the Tibet Center, primarily in partnership with the [[Richard Gere|Gere]] Foundation, has been instrumental in inviting and hosting the 14th Dalai Lama for seven teaching events in NYC:&lt;ref name="thetibetcenter.org"/&gt;

* 1979 - One day teaching at the [[Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine]]
* 1991 - The [[Kalachakra]] Initiation at the [[Madison Square Garden#The Theater at Madison Square Garden|Paramount Theatre at Madison Square Garden]], 2 weeks in total
* 1999 - Teaching on [[Kamalashila]]'s ''Middle Length Stages of Meditation'', and Togmay Sangpo's ''Thirty-Seven Practices of Bodhisattvas'' at the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]], also a public talk to 200,000 people in [[Central Park]]. The talks were later published as ''Open Heart: Practising Compassion in Everyday Life'' (2002).&lt;ref name="Lama2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lama|first=HH Dalai|title=Open Heart: Practising Compassion in Everyday Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbhvr_WUGd4C&amp;pg=PT7|date=5 September 2002|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|isbn=978-1-84894-053-6|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2003 - Four-day teaching of ''Root Verses on Indian Philosophies'' by the 17th-century Tibetan scholar Jamyang Shepa, and ''The Seven-Point Mind Training'' by the 12th-century Geshe Chekawa at the Beacon Theatre, as well as a public talk in Central Park on ''The Bodhisattva's Jewel Garland'' by [[Atisha]]
* 2007 - Teachings on the ''Diamond Cutter Sutra'', by [[Shakyamuni Buddha]], and ''Seventy Verses on Emptiness'', by [[Nagarjuna]], as well as a public talk on "Peace and Prosperity", at [[Radio City Music Hall]]
* 2010 - Four-day teaching on ''Commentary on Bodhicitta'' by Nagarjuna, and ''[[Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra|A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life]]'', by [[Shantideva]], followed by a public talk entitled "Awakening the Heart of Selflessness", at Radio City Music Hall
* 2013 - Teachings on the ''[[Heart Sutra]]'', ''The Sutra of the Recollection of the Three Jewels'', and the ninth chapter of ''The Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life'', by Shantideva. Also an initiation into "The Buddha Establishing the Three Pledges", and a public talk on "The Virtue of Nonviolence", at the Beacon Theatre

==Location==
As of 2014 to 2016, The Tibet Center was meeting each Monday at 7 pm at the [[University Settlement Society of New York]] Houston Street Center, which is located on [[the Bowery]], in [[Manhattan]], just south of Houston Street. The Tibet Center also currently offers, on many Saturday afternoons, [[White Tara]] retreats at the Kunkhyab Thardo Ling Retreat Home, in [[South Orange, New Jersey]].

'''Twinkling''', or '''scintillation''', is a generic term for variations in [[apparent brightness]] or [[apparent place|position]] of a distant luminous object viewed through a medium.&lt;ref name="intech"&gt;Wang,Ting-I; Williams, Donn; [http://www.isa.org/InTechTemplate.cfm?Section=Article_Index1&amp;template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=44354 "Scintillation technology bests NIST"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215902/http://www.isa.org/InTechTemplate.cfm?Section=Article_Index1&amp;template=%2FContentManagement%2FContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=44354 |date=2013-10-04 }}, ''InTech'', May 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; If the object lies outside the [[Earth's atmosphere]], as in the case of stars and [[planet]]s, the phenomenon is termed ''astronomical scintillation''; within the atmosphere, the phenomenon is termed ''terrestrial scintillation.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/hqlibrary/aerospacedictionary/508/508index.htm " NASA Aerospace Science and Technology Dictionary"], ''NASA.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the three principal factors governing [[astronomical seeing]], atmospheric twinkling is defined as variations in [[illuminance]] only.

In simple terms, twinkling of stars is caused by the passing of light through [[air mass (astronomy)|different layers]] of a turbulent atmosphere. Most scintillation effects are caused by anomalous [[refraction]] caused by small-scale fluctuations in [[air density]] usually related to temperature gradients.&lt;ref&gt;Sofieva, V. F.; Sofieva, A.S.; et al. [http://www.athena-spu.gr/ftp/lfsc/Literature/Sofieva_2007_GOMOS_GW-TurbulenceParamReconstruction.pdf "Reconstruction of internal gravity wave and turbulence parameters in the stratosphere using GOMOS scintillation measurements"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} ''Journal of Geophysical Research'' '''112'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VanCleave, Janice; [http://scienceprojectideasforkids.com/2010/stellar-scintillation-twinkling-stars/ "Stellar Scintillation: Twinkling Stars"] ''JVC's Science Fair Projects'', May 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Scintillation effects are always much more pronounced near the [[horizon]] than near the [[zenith]] (straight up),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/educ/activit/scint.htm "Scintillation or Atmospheric Boil"], ''noaa.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; since the light near the horizon passes through a thicker layer of atmosphere. Atmospheric twinkling is measured quantitatively using a [[scintillometer]].&lt;ref&gt;Chun, M.; Avila, R; [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2002ASPC..266...72C "Turbulence profiling using a scanning scintillometer"], ''Astronomical Site Evaluation in the Visible and Radio Range'', Astronomical Society of the Pacific '''266''':72-78&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of twinkling are reduced by using a larger receiver [[aperture]].  This effect is known as ''aperture averaging''.&lt;ref&gt;Perlot,.N.; Fritzsche, D. [http://elib.dlr.de/7341/1/LASE2004-5338-29_Perlot_ApAv_measur_HANDOUT.pdf "Aperture-Averaging - Theory and Measurements"], ''elib - Electronic Library''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=C. |last2=Phillips |first2=R.L |last3=Hopen |first3=C. |year=2000 |title=Aperture averaging of optical scintillations |journal=Waves in Random and Complex Media |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=53–70 |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While light from stars and other [[astronomical object]]s are likely to twinkle,&lt;ref&gt;Wheelon, Albert D. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Electromagnetic_Scintillation_Volume_2_W.html?id=CNPtmZJZWCAC "Electromagnetic Scintillation: Volume 2, Weak Scattering"], ''Cambridge University Press,'' Jul 31, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; twinkling usually does not cause images of planets to flicker appreciably.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, S.L.; Lawrence, M. et al; [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~mcba/pubs/kenyon06.pdf "Atmospheric Scintillation at Dome C, Antarctica"], ''Astronomical Society of the Pacific'' '''118''' 924-932&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellison |first1=M. W. |year=1952 |title=Why do Stars Twinkle? |journal=Irish Astronomical Journal |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=5–8 |publisher= |doi= |bibcode=1952IrAJ....2....5E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stars twinkle because they are so far from Earth that they appear as point sources of light easily disturbed by Earth's atmospheric [[turbulence]], which acts like lenses and prisms [[atmospheric refraction|diverting]] the light's path. Large astronomical objects closer to Earth, like the [[Moon]] and other planets, encompass many points in space and can be resolved as objects with observable diameters. With multiple observed points of light traversing the atmosphere, their light's deviations average out and the viewer perceives less variation in light coming from them.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, John A. [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-do-stars-twinkle "Why do stars twinkle?"] ''Scientific American,''  October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byrd, Deborah; [http://earthsky.org/space/why-dont-planets-twinkle-as-stars-do "Why don’t planets twinkle as stars do?"], ''Earthsky,'' October 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of the Philippines Los Baños''' (also referred to as '''UPLB''', '''UP Los Baños''', or colloquially, '''Elbi''') is a [[State university and college (Philippines)|public]] [[research institute|research]] [[university]] located in the towns of [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]] and [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]] in the province of [[Laguna province|Laguna]], some 64 kilometers southeast of [[Manila]]. It traces its roots to the [[University of the Philippines Los Baños College of Agriculture|UP College of Agriculture]] (UPCA), which was founded in 1909 by the [[History of the Philippines#Insular Government (1901–1935)|American colonial government]] to promote agricultural education and research in the [[Philippines]]. American botanist [[Edwin Copeland]] served as its first dean. UPLB was formally established in 1972 following the union of UPCA with four other Los Baños and [[Diliman]]-based [[University of the Philippines]] (UP) units.

The university has played an influential role in Asian agriculture and biotechnology due to its pioneering efforts in plant breeding and [[bioengineering]], particularly in the development of high-yielding and pest-resistant crops. In recognition of its work, it was awarded the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for International Understanding in 1977. Nine research centers are recognized as Centers of Excellence by presidential decree.&lt;ref name="chanrobles"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chanrobles.com/executiveorders/1983/executiveorderno889-1983.html

UPLB was originally established as the [[University of the Philippines College of Agriculture]] (UPCA) on 6 March 1909, by the UP [[board of regents]]. Edwin Copeland, an [[United States|American]] botanist and [[Thomasite]] from the [[Philippine Normal College]] in Manila, served as its first dean.&lt;ref name='UPLB History'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.uplb.edu.ph/about/uplb-history |title=UPLB History |publisher=University of the Philippines Los Baños |accessdate=19 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720100734/http://www.old.uplb.edu.ph/about/uplb-history |archivedate=20 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="100 Years 0"/&gt; Classes began in June 1909 with five professors, and 12 students initially enrolled in the program.&lt;ref name = "Ramon magsaysay award"/&gt; The [[University of the Philippines Los Baños College of Forestry and Natural Resources|Forestry School]] was established a year later.&lt;ref name="UPLB pride"/&gt;

During the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]], UPCA was closed and the campus converted into an [[internment camp]] for allied nationals and a headquarters of the Japanese army.&lt;ref name = "UPLB History"/&gt; For three years, the college was home to more than 2,000 civilians, mostly Americans, that were captured by the [[Japanese Imperial Army|Japanese]]. In 1945, as part of the liberation of the Philippines, the [[US Army]] sent 130 [[11th Airborne Division (United States)|11th Airborne Division paratroopers]] to Los Baños to rescue the internees.&lt;ref name='The Los Banos Prison Camp Raid – The Philippines 1945'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ospreypublishing.com/store/The-Los-Banos-Prison-Camp-Raid--–-The-Philippines-1945_9781849080750 | title = The Los Banos Prison Camp Raid – The Philippines 1945 | publisher = Osprey Publishing | accessdate = 20 March 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101105012333/http://www.ospreypublishing.com/store/The-Los-Banos-Prison-Camp-Raid--%E2%80%93-The-Philippines-1945_9781849080750/ | archive-date = 5 November 2010 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only four paratroopers and two [[Filipino people|Filipino]] guerrillas were killed in the raid. However, Japanese reinforcements arrived two days later, destroying UPCA facilities&lt;ref name = "UPLB History"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ramon magsaysay award"/&gt; and killing some 1,500 Filipino civilians in Los Baños soon afterwards.&lt;ref name = 'Remember Los Banos'&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.rememberlosbanos1945.com/ | title = Remember Los Baños 1945 | publisher = Los Baños Liberation Memorial Scholarship Foundation | accessdate = 20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= 'Liberating Los Banos'&gt;{{cite journal|author = Sam McGowan | date = 19 August 1999| url = http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-liberating-los-banos-internment-camp.htm | title = World War II: Liberating Los Baños | journal = World War II | accessdate = 20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UPCA became the first unit of the University of the Philippines to open after the war, with Leopoldo Uichangco as dean. However, only 125 (16 percent) of the original students enrolled. It was even worse for the School of Forestry, which only had nine students. Likewise, only 38 professors returned to teach. UPCA used its [[Philippine Peso|₱]]470,546 (US$10,800)&lt;ref name='conversion'&gt;Approximate conversion value as of May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; share in the Philippine-US War Damage Funds (released in 1947) for reconstruction.&lt;ref name = '100 Years'&gt;{{cite book | pages = 75–122 | chapter = Chs. 6–8 | year = 2007 | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Baños Alumni Association | location = Los Baños, Laguna | isbn = 978-971-547-252-4 | author = Fernando A. Bernardo |title = Centennial Panorama: Pictorial History of UPLB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further financial endowments from the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and the Mutual Security Agency (MSA) allowed the construction of new facilities, while scholarship grants, mainly from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[International Cooperation Administration]], helped fund training of UPCA faculty. From 1947 to 1958, a total of 146 faculty members had been granted MS and PhD scholarships in US universities.&lt;ref name = "100 Years"/&gt;

[[Dioscoro Umali]] became UPCA dean in 1959.

In 1972, UPCA requested [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] to allow the college to secede from the University of the Philippines due to the alleged withholding of its budget and the disapproval of curricular proposals.&lt;ref name = "100 Years 3"/&gt; However, [[President of the University of the Philippines|UP President]] [[Salvador P. Lopez]] strongly opposed the idea. A survey found that there was very little support for complete independence at UPCA. As a compromise, Lopez proposed the transformation of UP into a system of autonomous constituent universities. Finally, on 20 November 1972, [[List of Philippine laws|Presidential Decree]] No. 58 was signed, establishing UPLB as UP's first autonomous campus, with UPCA, College of Forestry, Agricultural Credit and Cooperatives Institute, Dairy Training and Research Institute, and the Diliman-based Agrarian Reform Institute as its first academic units.&lt;ref name = "100 Years 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "UPLB History"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ramon magsaysay award"/&gt;&lt;ref name = 'PD 58'&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1972/pd_58_1972.html | title = Presidential Decree No. 58 | publisher = Arellano Law Foundation | author = Ferdinand E.

In 2010 Chancellor Luis Rey Velasco's administration oversaw the implementation of a policy allowing for larger lecture classes to improve the "absorptive capacity" of the university by more than 500 students and to give them better access to some of the more seasoned professors.&lt;ref name='A Statement on the Large Class Size Project'&gt;{{cite book | url = http://uplb.edu.ph/email_attachments/2010-02-25_LargeClassStatement.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723073420/http://uplb.edu.ph/email_attachments/2010-02-25_LargeClassStatement.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 23 July 2011 | title = A Statement on the Large Class Size Project | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Baños| accessdate = 19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It increased the class size of 25 to 40 students to a much larger 120 to 175 for general education and foundation courses.

As part of the University of the Philippines System, UPLB is governed by the 11-person UP Board of Regents, which is jointly chaired by the head of the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] and the UP president.&lt;ref name='pascual'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.up.edu.ph/content.php?r=3&amp;c=3 |title=Alfredo Pascual: "The 20th UP President" |publisher=University of the Philippines |accessdate=11 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521000656/http://up.edu.ph/content.php?r=3&amp;c=3 |archivedate=21 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RA 9500"/&gt;

The Board of Regents has the authority to approve the institution, merger, and abolition of degree programs as recommended by the UP president. It also has the power to confer degrees. The UP president, who is appointed by the Board of Regents, is the university's chief executive officer and the head of the faculty.&lt;ref name="RA 9500"/&gt;

UPLB is administered by a chancellor who is elected by the UP Board of Regents to a three-year term. The chancellor may only serve for up to two terms.&lt;ref name="100 Years 5"/&gt;&lt;ref name='RA 9500'&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.up.edu.ph/pdf2/RA_9500.pdf |title=An Act to Strengthen the University of the Philippines as the National University |date=5 May 2008 |publisher=Office of the President of the Philippines |author=Congress of the Philippines |accessdate=28 March 2011 |location=Manila |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518015755/http://www.up.edu.ph/pdf2/RA_9500.pdf |archivedate=18 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under him are five vice-chancellors specializing in administration, community affairs, instruction, planning and development, and research and extension.&lt;ref name='About UPLB'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/about?start=1 |title=About UPLB – University Officials |publisher=University of the Philippines Los Baños |accessdate=28 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201130420/http://uplb.edu.ph/index.php/about?start=1 |archivedate=1 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current chancellor is Fernando C. Sanchez, the ninth to hold the office. He assumed the post on 28 October 2014.

UPLB, through the [[UP System]], is a member of the [[Association of Pacific Rim Universities]], a consortium of leading research universities in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;ref name='APRU'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apru.org/members/uphilippines.htm |publisher=Association of Pacific Rim Universities |title=University of the Philippines |accessdate=29 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930222116/http://www.apru.org/members/uphilippines.htm |archivedate=30 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===

UPLB's endowment totaled some ₱4&amp;nbsp;billion (US$90&amp;nbsp;million) in 2010, broken down into cash reserves (₱1.7&amp;nbsp;billion/US$40&amp;nbsp;million), investments (₱745&amp;nbsp;million/US$17&amp;nbsp;million) and national government subsidy (₱1.19&amp;nbsp;billion/US$30&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name='COA'&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.coa.gov.ph/Audit/AAR.htm |title=Consolidated Annual Audit Report on the University of the Philippines |year=2010 |accessdate=25 May 2012 |author=Commission on Audit |publisher=Commission on Audit |location=Quezon City |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421130257/http://www.coa.gov.ph/Audit/AAR.htm |archivedate=21 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This amount includes research funding from other sources, which was valued at ₱233&amp;nbsp;million (US$5.37&amp;nbsp;million)&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; in 2010. The biggest source was Philippine government agencies, at ₱136&amp;nbsp;million (US$3.13&amp;nbsp;million),&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; with the PCASTRD-DOST as the largest contributor. This represents a 32 percent decrease from the previous year. Meanwhile, contributions from international and local private agencies increased 101 percent and 71 percent respectively. In all, outside sources contributed some ₱98&amp;nbsp;million (US$2.26&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt;&lt;ref name='OVCRE 2010'&gt;{{cite book| url = http://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/images/docs/ovcre_2010highlights.pdf | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Baños Office of the Vice-Chancellor for Research and Extension | title = 2010 Highlights of Accomplishments | date = March 2010 | accessdate = 29 March 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare for its centennial year, UPLB launched several Centennial Fund campaigns, the largest being the Centennial Building Fund, which aims to raise ₱2&amp;nbsp;billion (US$46.1&amp;nbsp;million)&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; for the "construction, repair and maintenance of academic buildings and dormitories". Other Centennial Funds include the Centennial Celebration Fund and the Centennial Artists Endowment fund.&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Centennial'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://old.uplb.edu.ph/news/uplb-news/uplb-link/801 |author=JVG Baril |title= Centennial Fund Campaign updates |newspaper=University of the Philippines Los Baños Link |publisher=University of the Philippines Los Baños |date=June 2007 |accessdate=29 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823155828/http://old.uplb.edu.ph/news/uplb-news/uplb-link/801 |archivedate=23 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student government===

The University Student Council (USC) is the "highest governing body of all UPLB students." Together with college [[student council]]s (CSCs), it assembles as the Student Legislative Chamber and acts as the highest policy-making body of the USC. The USC is composed of a chairperson, vice-chairperson, 10 councilors, a representative for each college/school with less than 500 students, and an additional college representative for every 500 students in excess of the first 500. Members are given one-year terms. CSCs have a similar structure, but with a different number of councilors based on the student population.&lt;ref name='Basic Student Information'&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Student Information |url=http://old.uplb.edu.ph/osa/253 |publisher=University of the Philippines Los Baños |accessdate=29 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823155913/http://old.uplb.edu.ph/osa/253 |archivedate=23 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='USC'&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.oocities.org/usc_uplb/constitution.html | author= University Student Council | title = USC Constitution | accessdate=29 March 2011 | date=12 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Student Disciplinary Tribunal (SDT) is responsible for sanctioning erring students. Common offenses include student misconduct and fraternity rumbles. The SDT is composed of a chairperson, two appointees of the chancellor, a student juror, and a parent juror.&lt;ref name="Basic Student Information"/&gt;

===Admission and graduation===
{{see also|University of the Philippines College Admission Test|Academic grading in the Philippines#Grade point scale (5.00 - 1.00)|l2=Academic grading in the Philippines}}

UPLB admits more than 2,500 students and produces about 1,800 graduates every year.&lt;ref name="A Statement on the Large Class Size Project"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UPLB students, teachers stage protests vs large class policy"/&gt; Undergraduate admission is determined by the [[University of the Philippines College Admission Test]] (UPCAT). Examinees that select UPLB as their preferred campus and garner a University Predicted Grade (UPG) within the ''standard'' cut-off are automatically eligible for admission. Those who do not automatically qualify may file an appeal for reconsideration if their UPG is within the ''actual'' cut-off, though the appeal process does not guarantee admission.&lt;ref name='Qualifying'&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.upcatreview.com/tale-of-two-applicants | title = HOW THE EEAS WORKS: A Tale of Two Applicants | year = 2010 | accessdate= 21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Waitlist'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/students-and-alumni/386-2011-2012-uplb-wait-list-criteria |title=UPLB Wait List Criteria 1st SEM AY 2011–2012 |date=22 February 2011 |accessdate=21 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614094519/http://www.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/students-and-alumni/386-2011-2012-uplb-wait-list-criteria |archivedate=14 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cut-off scores may be adjusted according to a variety of factors. In 2010, UPLB had a ''standard'' UPG cut-off of 2.42 while the ''actual'' cut-off was 2.8 (this ''actual'' cut-off was retained in 2011). But in 2014–2015 UPCAT, according to the Office of the University Registrar, UPLB had a standard cut off score of 2.3.&lt;ref name='Waitlist Procedure'&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.upcatreview.com/uplb-upmin-waitlist-procedure | title = UP Waitlist Procedure | date = 28 February 2011 | accessdate= 21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Review'&gt;{{cite web|url = http://academic-clinic.com/2010/06/u-p-upg-cut-off-scores-and-reconsideration/ | title = U.P.

High school freshman admission, on the other hand, is determined by the eight-hour-long UPRHS Entrance Examination.

UPLB has a substantial no-show rate, with 42 percent of qualifiers opting not to enroll. The figures are worse for BS Forestry and [[Doctor of Veterinary Medicine]] programs, with no-show rates of 65 percent and 62 percent, respectively. Other programs with poor enrollment numbers include [[Bachelor of Science in Agriculture|BS Agriculture]], BS [[Agricultural engineering]], and BS [[Agricultural chemistry]].&lt;ref name="ToFI"/&gt;

Normally, a student who completes the program may graduate with [[Latin honors|honors]] if his general weighted average (GWA) is 1.75 or above.

===Tuition and financial aid===

The base tuition fee per unit in UPLB is ₱1,000 (US$23).&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; As with all UP constituents, UPLB implements the Socialized Tuition and Financial Assistance Program (STFAP). Under the program, students with annual family incomes between ₱1,000,000 (US$23,000) and ₱500,000 (US$11,500)&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; are charged the base tuition fee, while those with annual family incomes above ₱1,000,000 are charged ₱1,500 (US$35) per unit.&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; Students with annual family incomes between ₱500,000 and ₱135,000 (US$3,110) are charged ₱600 (US$14) per unit;&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; those who have between ₱135,000 and ₱80,000 (US$1,840) are charged ₱300 (US$7);&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; while those who have below ₱80,000 are not charged any fees.&lt;ref name='STFAP'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admin.uplb.edu.ph/download_file.php?f=16 |title=Report of the Committee to Review the Socialized Tuition and Financial Assistance Program (STFAP) |publisher=University of the Philippines |date=7 December 2006 |accessdate=4 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908162625/http://admin.uplb.edu.ph/download_file.php?f=16 |archivedate=8 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional financial assistance may be accessed through the Student Loan Board, which pays up to 80 percent of the tuition.&lt;ref name='ToFI'&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://fc01.deviantart.com/fs19/f/2007/270/e/d/UPLB_Perspective_Vol_34_Issue1_by_uplbperspective0708.pdf | title = ToFI Monitor: the real score behind the numbers | pages = 1, 4 | author = Aaron Joseph Aspi | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | journal = UPLB Perspective | date = 27 September 2007 | accessdate = 4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarship and loan programs are also offered by some UPLB units, such as the College of Veterinary Medicine.&lt;ref name='Vetmed grants'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cvm.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/loan-grants |title=Loan Grants |date=3 December 2010 |publisher=University of the Philippines Los Baños College of Veterinary Medicine |accessdate=4 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723073212/http://cvm.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/loan-grants |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current rates were introduced in 2007. Previously, base tuition was only ₱300 per unit (since 1989).&lt;ref name="STFAP"/&gt; Library and miscellaneous fees were also increased in 2007, from ₱400 (US$9) per student to ₱1,100 (US$25) and ₱2,000 (US$46), respectively.&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; New fees, such as internet and energy fees, were introduced. The USC sees the over 300 percent increase in tuition as the reason for the low enrollment rate and high student loan levels, which totaled some ₱14&amp;nbsp;million (US$326,000)&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; in 2007. Additionally, it criticizes the STFAP for allegedly being ineffective. Upon its introduction in 1989, only 16 percent of students received discounts. The number fell to 12 percent in 2007.&lt;ref name="ToFI"/&gt;

The Free Tuition Law mandates free tuition and fees for all state university students who are pursuing their degree for the first time. Students who avail of the subsidy will be required to provide return service, although it is possible to opt out and pay the full tuition instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=8 things you need to know about the free tuition law |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/198314-things-to-know-free-tuition-law-irr |publisher=Rappler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest innovations of UPLB was the production of CAC 87 sugar cane in 1919. This high-yielding variety is resistant to [[fiji disease virus|fiji]] and [[mosaic virus]]es, and produces more [[sucrose]] than other varieties. Its derivatives significantly increased sugar cane production in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="100 Years 0"/&gt; Between 1921 and 1939, cattle, poultry, and swine breeding programs produced new breeds, namely the Philamin (a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of the [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]], [[Nellore]] and native cattle), Berkjala (a variety of the [[Berkshire (pig)|Berkshire]] and local [[Jala-Jala, Rizal|Jala-Jala]] pig, resistant to [[hog cholera]]) and the Los Baños Cantonese chicken, which produces more eggs.&lt;ref name = '100 Years 0.5'&gt;{{cite book| pages = 47–74 | chapter = Chs. 4–5 | year = 2007 | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Baños Alumni Association | location = Los Baños, Laguna | isbn = 978-971-547-252-4 | author = Fernando A.

===Biofuel research===

Pioneering efforts in [[biofuel]] research have been conducted at the university. Studies conducted in the 1930s found that gasoline with 15–20 percent [[ethanol]], dubbed "gasanol", was more efficient than pure gasoline.&lt;ref name="100 Years 0.5"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Pimentel'&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?ArticleId=2993&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=72 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130131074450/http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?ArticleId=2993&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=72 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 31 January 2013 | title = &lt;!-- The title stated at the page was obviously misencoded.

==Student life==

In 2008, 2,170 students&lt;ref name="A Statement on the Large Class Size Project"/&gt; were housed in the eight dormitories managed by UPLB. In the academic year 2011–2012, fees for all UPLB dormitories increased by at least 25 percent from the previous rate of ₱350 (US$8) a month.&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt;&lt;ref name='dorm fee'&gt;{{cite book| url = http://www.uplb.edu.ph/attachments/401_announcement-dorm-rates-2011.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723160357/http://www.uplb.edu.ph/attachments/401_announcement-dorm-rates-2011.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 23 July 2011 | title = New dorm fees | author = Margaret M.

===Student Organizations===

As of December 2012, there are 175 recognized student organizations in UPLB. Of these, 71 are academic, 15 are cultural, 2 are international, 2 are political, 10 are religious, 24 are socio-civic, 5 are sports and recreational, 21 are varsitarian, while 12 and 13 are [[fraternities and sororities]], respectively.&lt;ref name='UPLB org'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.soadosa.org/orgs |title=SOAD-OSA: List of Organizations |accessdate=13 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032952/https://www.soadosa.org/orgs |archive-date=2 May 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regional organizations were not recognized by UPLB prior to September 2008, when the [[University of the Philippines]] [[board of regents]] repealed Chapter 72 Article 444 of the 1984 University of the Philippines Code, which states that "organizations which are provincial, sectional or regional in nature shall not be allowed in the University System." Likewise, Section 3 of the code states that "the University of the Philippines System is a public, ''secular'', non-profit institution of higher learning." Due to this, religious organizations have had some difficulty in getting recognized.&lt;ref name='religion 1'&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs38/f/2008/353/4/e/5th_Issue_by_uplbperspective0809.pdf |title = Recognition ng religious orgs, nakabinbin pa rin |author=Yves Christian Suiza |date=17 December 2008 |page=3 |volume=35 |issue=5 |journal=UPLB Perspective |accessdate=15 April 2011 |language=Tagalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='religion 2'&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/11644663/uplb-perspective-0809-2nd-ish |title=OSA holds recognition of religious, varsitarian orgs | author = Katrina Elauria | date = 4 September 2008 | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | accessdate = 15 April 2011 | journal = UPLB Perspective | pages = 2, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='religion 3'&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/11645011/uplb-perspective-0809-7th-ish | title = OSA withholds recognition of orgs | author = Faith Allyson Buenacosa| page = 7 | date = 29 January 2009 | issue = 7 | volume = 35 | journal = UPLB Perspective | accessdate = 15 April 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only recognized organizations are allowed to use UPLB facilities.&lt;ref name='Oble run'&gt;{{cite news | url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view/20101216-309245/UP-budget-slash-marks-APO-run-in-Los-Baos-campus | title = UP budget slash marks APO run in Los Baños campus | author = Maricar Cino | date = 16 December 2010 | newspaper = Philippine Daily Inquirer | accessdate = 10 April 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101219211033/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view/20101216-309245/UP-budget-slash-marks-APO-run-in-Los-Baos-campus | archive-date = 19 December 2010 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system of student organizations in UPLB is different from that of other UP constituents in that freshmen are not allowed to join any organization until they have earned at least 30 units.

===Loyalty Day===

Every October 10, UPLB celebrates Loyalty Day, which has also become UPLB's [[homecoming|alumni homecoming]]. The celebration commemorates events in 1918, when more than half of students and faculty (193 out of 300 students and 27 out of 32 faculty), including two women, enlisted in the [[Philippine National Guard]] for service in [[France]] during [[World War I]]. The volunteers never saw action, as the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Forces]] signed an [[armistice with Germany]] during the same year, essentially ending the war.&lt;ref name="100 Years 0"/&gt;&lt;ref name='alumni homecoming'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.uplb.edu.ph/centennial/1260 |title=89th UPLB Loyalty Day and Alumni Homecoming |publisher=University of the Philippines Los Baños |author=MM Catibog |accessdate=10 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823155211/http://old.uplb.edu.ph/centennial/1260 |archivedate=23 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ='ARSECOM'&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.army.mil.ph/Army_Sites/INFANTRY%20DIVISIONS/arescom/4rcdg/403cdc/uplb/ar403_uplb_history.htm | title = UP ROTC Los Baños Unit | publisher = Armed Forces of the Philippines | accessdate = 10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feb Fair===

The university holds a major campus fair, known as "Feb Fair", during [[Valentine’s Day|Valentine's]] week. The fair was initially held to express opposition to [[Martial Law in the Philippines|martial law]] under [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], who abolished student organizations and student councils.&lt;ref name='Feb fair'&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/13215006/uplb-perspective-9th-ish | title = Students assess centennial feb fair | author = Nikko Caringal | pages= 3–4| journal= UPLB Perspective | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | date = 13 March 2009|accessdate= 10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous Valuka Iswar shrines==
The ancient [[Walkeshwar Temple]] in the [[India]]n city of [[Mumbai]] was built under the supervision of minister [[Lakshman Prabhu]] of the [[Silhara dynasty]] to commemorate and worship Valuka Iswar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etirth.wordpress.com/2008/03/11/ram-temple-walkeshwar-mumbai-maharashtra-india/ Walkeshwar, Mumbai, Maharashtra]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water supply and women in developing countries''' is a complex topic, as lack of accessible, sufficient, clean and affordable [[water supply]] has adverse impacts specifically related to women in [[Developing country|developing nations]]. In most countries, women are the primary household members responsible for providing water for domestic consumption.&lt;ref name=UNWATER&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/EGM_report.pdf, Gender-Disaggregated Data on Water and Sanitation], UN-DESA and UN-DCP, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of water, which may take up to six hours a day to meet the household needs, is a duty often relegated to women and children. This foregone time often prevents children, especially girls, from attending school and women from pursuing small business opportunities.&lt;ref name=Water&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/es072435t, "Water and Sanitization in Developing Countries: Including Health in the Equation"],  Maggie A Montgomery and Menachem Elimelech, Yale University, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Second World Water Forum in The Hague concluded that women are the primary users of domestic water, that women used water in their key food production roles, and that women and children were the most vulnerable to water-related disasters.&lt;ref name="Women and Water"&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/Feb05.pdf, "Women and Water"], UN Division for the Advancement of Women, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; At the International Conference on Water and the Environment, the [[Dublin Statement|Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development]] included "Women Play a central part in the provision management and safeguarding of water" as one of 4 principles. Many women's rights and water advocacy organizations have identified water privatization as an area of concern, sometimes alleging negative effects that specifically affect women.&lt;ref name=Diverting&gt;[http://www.wedo.org/wp-content/uploads/divertingtheflow.pdf,  "Diverting the Flow: A Resource Guide to Gender, Rights and Water Privatization"], Women's Environment and Development Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Gender, Water, and Sanitization"&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/inter_agency/gender_water/policybrief.pdf, "Gender, Water, and Sanitization"], UN Water Policy Brief, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusion of women and the efficacy of water supply==
[[File:India - Sights &amp; Culture - 33 - woman fetching water.jpg|thumb|A woman walking a long distance fetching water in India]]
Water supply schemes in developing nations have shown higher success when planned and run with full participation of women in the affected communities.&lt;ref name="Gender in Water Resource Management"&gt;, Van Wijk-Sijbesma, Christine, 1998. Gender in Water Resources Management, Water Supply and Sanitation: Roles and Realities.&lt;/ref&gt; A study including 88 communities in 14 countries showed that projects where men and women from intended user households were included in selection of site facilities, and where water projects were initiated by user households, rather than by external agencies or local leaders, achieved a final higher access to services than those that did not.&lt;ref name="WSP"&gt;[http://www.wsp.org/wsp/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/global_plareport.pdf, "Linking Sustainability with Demand,Gender and Poverty"], International Water and Sanitation Centre, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Chile===
Chilean law does not specifically include a gender component relating to water projects, but notes that all water projects must assess impact on the "lives and customs of human groups".&lt;ref name=genderwater/&gt; A study commissioned in 2000 by the Direccion General de Aguas relating to gender and the challenges of water resources noted: {{quote|text=All government institutions dealing with water resources have a very low percentage of women at the planning and decision-making levels. In stakeholder associations, their percentage in decision-making functions is even lower because women seldom participate in this kind of organisation. A sample study of water rights shoed that 16 percent of these rights belong to women. In the rural areas, the gender balance in water management is somewhat better, especially in the Indian territories. The current average percentage of women presidents in the rural zones is almost 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Direccion General de Aguas, Maria Angelica Algeria, Ingeniera Jefa Area de Evaluacion de Recursos Hidricos, Chile (this quote does not seem to be from a publication and the publication from which it has been quoted should be added)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Uganda ===

The 1995 Constitution of the [[Republic of Uganda]], Article 33 [2] states "The State shall provide the facilities and opportunities necessary to enhance the welfare of women to enable them to realise their full potential and advancement".&lt;ref name=ugandaconstitution&gt;[http://www.uganda.at/Geschichte/verfassung_der_republik_Uganda_2008.pdf, The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this outlined responsibility, though excluded from official water statutes, has been addressed in the National Gender Policy, National Water Policy, and the Local Government Act. The National Gender Policy lays out a framework for gender-oriented sectoral policy in development. The National Water Policy calls for the inclusion of women at all stages of implementation, noting that "women and men should have equal opportunities to participate fully in all aspects of community management".&lt;ref name=genderwater&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/Gender_Perspectives_Policies.pdf, "The Gender and Water Development Report 2003"], The Gender and Water Alliance.&lt;/ref&gt; The local government act requires 30% of the representation on local councils to be women, currently at around 10%.&lt;ref name=genderwater/&gt;

=== Kenya ===
[[Kenya]]'s "Country Strategy on Integrated Water Resource Management" addresses the issue of gender and water source:
{{quote|text=As women play an important role in provision,  management and safeguarding of water, particular attention will be placed on adequately incorporating and representing gender considerations in water resource management. The issues will be addressed from two perspectives: facilitating the participation and involvement of both sexes in water resource management; and the access(benefits) of both sexes in availability of water.|sign=Department of Water Management |source=Country Strategy on Integrated Water Resources Management, Section IV. Sectoral Analysis and Policy Recommendations. Poverty and Sustainable Livelihoods.}} The text itself is slighted by critics as not referring to equitable participation and division of workload, as well as benefits. However the Kenyan Women's Bureau has begun to cooperate with the Water Department on these matters, through a focus on environmental management, poverty alleviation, and gender.&lt;ref name=genderwater/&gt;

===Malawi===
In [[Malawi]], a group of men managing community water sources was found to be ineffective as they were often absent during the workday. A management group consisting only of women was set up to replace the men, and water supply was reported to have improved. However the burden was too much for the female-only group and communities now split the work with an equitable share of duties.&lt;ref name=MALAWI&gt;Deda, P., Rubian, R., 2004. Women and Biodiversity: The Long Journey from Users to Policy-Makers. Natural Resources Forum, 28(3): 201-204.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in Malawi have also initiative in the maintenance of improved water sources, forming water tap committees composed mostly of women and using the pipelines as footpaths, reporting leaks to the village caretaker.&lt;ref name=WORLDBANK1&gt;World Bank, 1996. Toolkit on Gender in Water and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and capacity development==
In scaling down water projects to the individual level, women have been found to be effective teachers at a domestic levels, and gender-sensitive approaches to water and [[sanitation]] have proven to be cost effective.&lt;ref name=GENDERPERSPECTIVE&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/bground_2.pdf, "A Gender Perspective on Water Resources and Sanitation"], Interagency Task Force on Gender and Water, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; In the Eastern Development Region in Nepal,   a small scale water management project under a "Community Water and Sanitation Programme" has shown success in a women-led team, which manages 23 tap stands in a village of the ''Jhapa''' district in addition to running adult literacy programs and latrine construction.&lt;ref name=NEPAL2&gt;Mahapatra, K., 1996. Towards Empowerment:  Women Mobilizers in the Community Water Supply and Sanitation Programme in Nepal. Waterfront,  9:12-13, 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[El Salvador]], The "Watersheds and Gender Project" has taught women technical agricultural knowledge, promoted women as trainers, and fostered female participation in positions previously uniquely occupied by men.&lt;ref name=ELSAVADOR&gt;Agua Project Report, 2002. El Salvador: AGUA Project Evaluation August–September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access ==
Access problems relating to water involve long walking distance to the source, low water quality, lack of a sufficient quantity of water, high water prices and poor system design. Women often suffer disproportionately from these problems. In [[Ghana]], women and children suffer as the result of failed water supply schemes where women consumed unclean water to save money to feed children.&lt;ref name="Ghana"&gt;[http://bscw.ihe.nl/pub/bscw.cgi/d2221893/AmengaEtagoWaterPrivatisationinGhana.pdf, "Water Privatization in Ghana: Womens Rights Under Siege"], Rudolf Amenga-Etego, Coordinator, Advocacy And Campaign Programmes, Integrated Social Development Centre, Accra-Ghana.&lt;/ref&gt; In east [[Nepal]] tap stands and tube wells were located along roads, so that women had to travel long distances or wait until nightfall to avoid being seen by men while bathing freely or washing clothes.&lt;ref name=eastNepal&gt;Regmi, S.C., Fawcett, B., 1999. Integrating Gender Needs Into Drinking Water Projects in Nepal. Gender and Development, 7(3): 62-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health effects ==
[[File:Schistosomiasis itch.jpeg|thumb|A hand showing [[schistosomiasis]] itch]]
Health and access are often related in gender-related issues of water sourcing. In [[Tanzania]], urinary [[schistosomiasis]] among women and girls was associated with the local practice of washing clothes in water infested with the vectors for the disease. As part of a project to drill wells the washing of clothes at hand pumps had been banned, forcing women to wash clothes in the open, infested water.&lt;ref name=untapped&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/untapped_eng.pdf, "Untapped Connections: Gender, Water, and Poverty"], Women's Environment and Development organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Cholera outbreaks are also of concern, as in Alexandra and KwaZulu, [[South Africa]] following contaminated water use which had been linked by some observers to water supply privatization in some localities.&lt;ref name=Diverting /&gt; In addition, women are often primary caretakers for HIV positive family members who require clean water in treatment, lack thereof can complicate existing effects.&lt;ref name=Diverting /&gt;

==Water and gender in international organizations==
The [[United Nations]] Interagency Network on Women and Gender Equality (IANWGE) established the Gender and Water Task Force in 2003. The Task Force has since become a UN-Water Task Force and is taking responsibility for the gender component of International Water for Life Decade (2005-1015).&lt;ref name=UNWEB&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/TFgender.html, UN Water Activities]&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force has also called for additional empirical data regarding the issue, as "Neither the quality nor type of data currently collected are adequate to the task of supporting gender [[Millennium Development Goal]]s in water and sanitation".&lt;ref name=letter&gt;[http://www.ecosanres.org/pdf_files/Summary%20of%20EGM%20Report%20on%20Gender-disaggregated%20data-lowres.pdf, Summary Report on Gender-Disaggregated Data on Water and Sanitation], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] Gender and Development Group has also addressed the issue at an institutional level, citing successful "Gender-Mainstreaming" efforts in many of its Water Supply and Sanitation projects.&lt;ref name=WSG&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Water_March07.pdf, "Water, Sanitation and Gender"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1834">A '''zygospore''' is a [[diploid]] reproductive stage in the life cycle of many [[fungi]] and [[protist]]s.  Zygospores are created by the nuclear fusion of [[haploid]] cells.  In fungi, zygospores are formed in '''zygosporangia''' after the fusion of specialized budding structures, from [[mycelia]] of the same (in [[homothallic]] fungi) or different mating types (in [[heterothallic]] fungi), and may be [[chlamydospore]]s.&lt;ref name="MooreRobson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Moore|author2=Geoffrey D. Robson|author3=Anthony P. J. Trinci|title=21st Century Guidebook to Fungi with CD|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oEmKmLkFaWwC&amp;pg=PA52|date=14 July 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-00676-8|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many [[eukaryotic]] [[algae]], including many species of the [[Chlorophyta]], zygospores are formed by the fusion of [[unicellular]] gametes of different mating types.

A zygospore remains dormant while it waits for environmental cues, such as light, moisture, heat, or chemicals secreted by [[plant]]s. When the environment is favorable, the zygospore germinates, meiosis occurs, and haploid vegetative cells are released.

In fungi, a [[sporangium]] is produced at the end of a sporangiophore that sheds [[spore]]s. A fungus that forms zygospores is called a [[zygomycete]], indicating that the [[class (biology)|class]] is characterized by this evolutionary development.
