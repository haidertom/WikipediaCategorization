      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3570">'''Adusted RevPAR''' (or '''ARPAR''', adjusted revenue per available room), is a performance metric used in the hotel industry. It is calculated by dividing the variable net revenues of a property by the total available rooms (see more formulas below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=7 Methods for Measuring and Improving Hotel Performance|url=https://www.amadeus-hospitality.com/insight/measuring-and-improving-hotel-performance/|website=Amadeus Hospitality|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The difference between ARPAR and other metrics ([[RevPAR]], [[TRevPAR]], [[GOPPAR]]) is that it accounts for variable costs and additional revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sunny|first1=Kiran|title=Neither revPAR nor occupancy are ideal indicators of hotel profitability – it’s all about the ARPAR!|url=https://www.hospitalitynet.org/opinion/4077407.html|website=HospitalityNet|publisher=Hotelogix|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculations==
Various formulas can be used to calculate ARPAR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vouk|first1=Ira|title=REVENUE MANAGEMENT MADE EASY, for Midscale and Limited-Service Hotels: The 6 Strategic Steps for Becoming the Most Valuable Person at Your Property.|date=Mar 31, 2018|publisher=Ira Vouk Revenue Management Services|isbn=978-1-387-70254-1|pages=18-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* (Room Revenue + Other Revenues – VarCPOR х Number of occupied rooms) / Total Number of rooms available for sale

* (Room Revenue/Number of occupied rooms + Other Revenues/Number of occupied rooms – VarCPOR) x Occupancy

* [(Room Revenue/Number of occupied rooms + Other Revenues/Number of occupied rooms – VarCPOR) х Number of occupied rooms] / (Number of rooms at the hotel x Number of days in the period)

where VarCPOR is Variable Costs per Occupied Room

The most commonly used formula is:

*ARPAR = (ADR – Var costs per occ room + Additional revenues per occ room) x Occupancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From RevPAR to TRevPAR – how profitable is your hotel?|url=https://www.customer-alliance.com/en/articles/revpar/|website=Customer Alliance Resources|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADR, Occupancy Rate, RevPar, ARPar|url=https://quizlet.com/186158756/adr-occupancy-rate-revpar-arpar-flash-cards/|website=Quizlet|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it compares to RevPAR==
ARPAR accounts for variable costs and additional revenues, thus it reflects the profit (bottom line) versus top line revenue.

==How it compares to GOPPAR==
GOPPAR accounts for all costs (not only variable) and is retroactive. ARPAR considers revenues from all departments and only var costs and can be used in forecasts.

==Conditions==
*    There is no standard formula for CPOR (cost per occupied room) in the industry and no standardization in regards to separating variable costs from fixed, which requires approximation when calculating VarCPOR. However, these calculations are only performed once.
*    Due to the above, ARPAR of each individual property can not be compared to others and is intended for internal use only.

As Shiseido has grown to become an international cosmetics giant, the company has managed to avoid some of the pitfalls and problems which have attended generational transitions in other successful family businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon
-Rouvinez, Denise. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=AbfTcruXZnAC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=arinobu+fukuhara&amp;source=web&amp;ots=RjONsarzz5&amp;sig=e5D8PYxnV07PQWPbzH1RHYBZo4Y&amp;hl=en#PPA89,M1 "Sharing Wisdom, Building Values: Letters from Family Business Owners to their Successors,'' p. 89.]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Arinobu's grandson, Yoshiharu Fukuhara, joined Shiseido immediately after receiving his B.A. in economics from Keio University, Tokyo, in 1953. He was appointed President &amp; CEO of Shiseido in 1987, then Chairman of the Board in 1997 and Honorary Chairman in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocw.dmc.keio.ac.jp/Alumni_essay_1.html  Keio alumni essay]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Fukuhara leaders in the Shiseido hierarchy were:
* 1st President: Fukuhara, Shinzo—son of company founder
* 2nd President: Fukuhara, Nobuyoshi—younger brother of company's 1st president 
* 3rd President: Fukuhana, Yoshibaru—son of company's 2nd president

The '''Australian Shareholders' Association''' ('''ASA''') is an independent, member-funded, '''not-for-profit''' organisation that has grown to be the major autonomous body representing Australian retail investors.

The ASA's main mission is ''''''Standing up for shareholders''''''.

Since 1960 the ASA has been protecting and advancing the interests of investors and providing a strong collective voice for shareholders. It does this by advancing the interests of retail [[shareholders]] with government, industry, the markets and individual companies - monitoring companies with the aim of improving both financial performance and corporate governance. The ASA has successfully raised the standard of corporate governance in Australian companies and continues to press for improvements in transparency and accountability.

Each year the ASA monitors the performance of Australia's top 200 ASX-listed companies. The ASA's company monitoring objective is to positively influence outcomes for retail shareholders. The ASA wants all shareholders to be treated equally and advocates for change where change is due.

The ASA helps members to improve their investment knowledge and financial literacy with free member meetings, discussion groups and cost-effective education across Australia, including many regional areas. By providing independent research, governance information and well-priced education programs the ASA helps members develop practical skills to improve their investing knowledge.

==Current activities==
The ASA advocates for shareholders by attending company [[annual general meeting]]s (AGMs) and engaging with government and industry bodies on behalf of shareholders. Based on engagement with company boards and independent analysis of annual reports and financial statements, company monitors prepare Voting Intentions (VIs) consistent with ASA policy. Company monitors represent the ASA at AGMs, where issues such as [[Executive pay|executive remuneration]], company performance, shareholder rights and director qualifications/workloads are discussed, and proxies voted. AGM Reports are prepared by the company monitors and are available online so members can see how Australia's leading companies are performing, and how effectively they're managed.

All shareholders are welcome to nominate the ASA as their proxy. The ASA then votes on your behalf at the company's AGM. Last year, ASA company monitors voted more than $3 billion worth of shares.

The ASA publishes a monthly magazine called EQUITY, holds regular member meetings across Australia and organises a biennial national conference.

==Industry Groups and Committees==
The ASA represents shareholder and member interests on the following industry groups and committees:
*  ATO Personal Tax Advisory
*  ASIC Consumer Advisory Panel
*  ASIC Corporations &amp; Market Advisory Committee
*  Financial Reporting Council
*  ASX Corporate Governance Council
*  Securities Registrars Association of Australia

==Achievements==
The ASA has proactively promoted good corporate governance and advanced shareholder interests by:
* Consistently advocating for regulatory reform (i.e. two strikes rule) regarding remuneration excesses in Australian companies, and voting against poorly structured remuneration structures.
* Arguing through a long, consistent and vocal campaign in the media, by our voting intentions and especially on the floor of AGMs, for companies to move to longer-term incentive schemes.
* Being the world's largest retail shareholder group voting the greatest number of proxies.
* Successfully negotiating with Australian companies to increase the capped share purchase plan offered to retail shareholders.
* Successfully persuading companies to send reminder emails to shareholders in the final week of a capital raising offer, substantially increasing participation.
* Being the dominant voice at AGMs and, along with the $3 billion+ in undirected proxies received each year, being in a unique position to influence boards and companies on behalf of shareholders. A majority of ASX200 Chairs meet with ASA representatives prior to their AGM, allowing the ASA to make important connections and enabling influence over a company's governance and board performance.
* By introducing a workload policy of 5 equivalent directorships for directors and no external directorships for CEOs.
* Opposing ASX changes that would make it easier for smaller companies to list and for small to medium listed companies from being able to raise 25% of issued capital without shareholder approval.

==Membership==
The ASA had 6,000 members in 2013.

==Leadership==
The ASA is overseen by an experienced Board of Directors comprising a Chairman and six directors.
All Board members work on a pro bono basis.

===Chair===
* Diana D'Ambra (2015–present)
* Ian Curry (2012–2015)
* Helen Dent (2009-2012)
* Ian Curry (2007–08)
* Stephen Matthews (2005–07)
* John Curry (2003–05)

The '''Bureau of International Recycling (BIR)''' is a global [[recycling industry|recycling]] [[industry association]] representing more than 700 companies from the private sector and 40 national [[trade federation]]s from 70 different countries. The organisation serves as a platform to [[advocacy|promote]] business relations and recycling among industry and to liaise with policy makers.

== Mission ==
As part of its mission, BIR tackles the following important and fundamental issues:
* Market: promote international trade in an environmentally sound manner in both recycled materials and recycling technology
* Environment: aiming for lower energy consumption, reducing [[CO2 emissions]] and preserving the planet’s natural resources
* Economy: help drive tomorrow’s [[sustainable development|sustainable management of resources]]

==Ongoing Activities==
BIR represents the industry in discussions with supra-national organisations such as the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrw.co.uk/news/lead-recycling-cartel-investigation-starts/8636682.article Materials Recycling World]&lt;/ref&gt; and in working with the [[International Maritime Bureau]] to help combat container theft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marsecreview.com/2012/08/container-theft/ Maritime Security Review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-ccs.org.uk/news/744-imb-survey-notes-container-security-challenges ICC-CCS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218004631/http://www.icc-ccs.org.uk/news/744-imb-survey-notes-container-security-challenges |date=December 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also provides data on the recycling industry to organisations such as the OECD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/env/resourceproductivityandwaste/38093900.pdf OECD]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced Section|date=March 2015}}
Founded in 1948, the BIR (originally called the Bureau International de la Récupération) is the oldest international association in the recycling sector. Following the second world war, when primary and secondary [[raw materials]] were extremely scarce, a handful of leading private recycling companies from the [[Benelux]] countries called for the creation of an international organisation to overcome trade barriers and to facilitate cross-border business, principally to supply [[steel mills]], [[foundries]] and [[paper mills]]. This initiative was therefore was started in Europe and was eventually expand its reach to the worldwide stage.
 
The process started in March 1948 when leading recyclers met in [[Amsterdam]]. Following this first meeting, the presidents of the Belgian and Dutch scrap organisations invited [[Luxembourg]], France and [[Great Britain]] to join BIR. Later, the same invitation would be extended to the [[Scandinavia]]n countries.

BIR soon became acknowledged by national and international bodies, as well as by governments. Other countries applied for membership including Switzerland, the United States and Sweden. In 1953, during the BIR Convention in Paris, the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] also joined.

In 1971 BIR moved its headquarters from Paris to Brussels, the seat of the [[European Union]] (EU), and this move brought with it some changes to the organisation - in particular, the formation of three independent European scrap trade associations (called today EFR, EUROMETREC and ERPA) which were created to look after the interests of their specific recycling sectors within the EU and to represent the recycling industry at the EU Commission.

On a world level, BIR continued to expand to other non-EU countries, and in particular into [[Eastern Europe]], Russia and [[Asia]], eventually changing name to become the Bureau of International Recycling. Subsequently, new communications programmes and tools were developed and direct membership from commercial enterprises was encouraged, particularly from countries where there were no national federations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11079">{{Chinese name|[[Cheah]]}}
'''Cheah Cheang Lim''' ({{zh|c=謝昌林|p=Xiè Chānglín}}; 6 December 1875 – 15 November 1948) was born in [[Taiping, Perak]], [[Malaysia]]. Brought up by his father, Cheah Boon Hean, who was in the trading business, he grew up to become a businessman and miner. He was introduced to the [[tin mining]] industries of the time by his cousin [[Foo Choo Choon]], the 'Tin King',&lt;ref&gt;Ho Tak Ming, ''When Tin was King''. Ipoh: Ho Tak Ming, 2000. {{ISBN|978-983-42500-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; who hired him as his attorney. Later, Cheah Cheang Lim was appointed to manage his affairs. Eventually, he started his own company. He also invested in rubber estates but his main interest remained in the tin business.

Cheah was also known as a social reformer whose concerns were spread across various issues. He was involved in the [[anti-opium movement]] and campaigned for Chinese status in the [[Federated Malay States|Malay States]], including such efforts as debating against the [[Banishment Enactment]] to non-Malays born in the States. He furthermore dedicated his life to promoting and improving Malayan education by instituting several scholarship schemes, including the [[Queen's Scholar (British Malaya and Singapore)|Queen's Scholar]]ships in British Malaya&lt;ref&gt;Wu Lien-Teh &amp; Ng Yok-Hing, ''The Queen's Scholarships of Malaya, 1885–1948''. Penang: Penang Premier Press Co. Ltd., 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; and through donations.&lt;ref name=lifeandtimes&gt;Francis Cooray &amp; Khoo Salma Nasution, ''Redoutable Reformer: The Life and Times of Cheah Cheang Lim''. Penang: Areca Books, 2015. {{ISBN|9789675719202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Volunteering]] in the Malayan Volunteer Infantry&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 7 August 1916, Page 8. [http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19160807-1.2.41.aspx ''Malayan Volunteer Infantry'']&lt;/ref&gt; was a significant part of his later career, as he led the younger generation in a volunteer programme. He was active in several clubs and societies across Malaysia, but mainly in [[Perak]] and [[Penang]], where he resided. He was lastly elected as a Federal Counsellor, as a representative of the Chinese population.

==Early life==
Cheah Cheang Lim spent his early years in Taiping. His father was Cheah Boon Hean, son of Cheah Teah and a businessman and trader. His mother was Foo Kang Nyong. At that time, British administrative branches occupied the area, together with the [[Sikhism in Malaysia|Perak Sikhs]], the police force. The [[Residential System]] was in practice. Later, a great fire destroyed the Cheah house. The family was invited to stay at Dr. Legge's residence until Cheah Boon Hean made new arrangements.&lt;ref name=lifeandtimes /&gt;

==Education==
After attending a few temporary schools in Taiping, Cheah studied at the Central Government School, managed by Mr. J.L. Greene, now known as the [[King Edward VII School (Taiping)|King Edward VII School]], up to Standard VI. In 1889, he finished school and applied for a job at the Land Office in Taiping. He was rejected due to his age. He went back to school, became a pupil teacher and studied privately for one year.

==Career==
In 1890, he became a probationer at the Posts and Telegraphs Department. Later, he went to replace a brother officer in [[Kuala Sepetang|Port Weld]] and subsequently, to his friend Joo Sip San at Lahat, Perak. Cheah was a Malay scholar and helped with English correspondence, while he also taught the staff at the Posts and Telegraphs Department to read and write in the Malay language.

In 1894, Cheah took over R. Bulner as the postmaster in [[Tanjung Malim]]. He was later transferred back to Lahat, where he resigned, as a government office no longer satisfied his ambitions. He had planned to travel to China but was offered a job as the private secretary of [[Foo Choo Choon]], his cousin, proprietor of the globally known Tronoh Mines.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Wright &amp; H.A. Cartwright, ''Twentieth Century Impressions of British Malaya: Its History, People, Commerce, Industries, and Resources''. Indiana: Repressed Publishing LLC, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, he became the general manager. He worked under Foo Choo Choon for 14 years, until he decided to start his own mining business. His first mine was at Azar Dungsang.

In 1923, he was appointed a [[Justice of the peace|justice of peace]] for the State of Perak.

In 1927, he was elected as a member of the Federal Council to represent the Chinese community. He served for two terms, from 1927 to 1930 and from 1930 to 1933.

===The Anti-Opium Movement===
Cheah was an active supporter of the anti-opium movement. He was one of the founders of the [[Perak Anti-Opium Society]], which was created in December 1906, and was elected as the treasurer. A similar organization was founded in Penang, presided by Dr.[[Wu Lien-teh]]. The first Anti-Opium Conference of the [[Straits Settlements]] and [[Federated Malay States]] was held in [[Ipoh]] in 1907. It attracted around 3,000 people. The second conference was renewed in 1908 with Mr. [[Foo Choo Choon]] as the chairman. It was held in Penang, as, at that time, Penang was a significant landmark in the manufacturing and export of opium to Perak and Southern Siam.&lt;ref name=lifeandtimes /&gt; In addition, mass meetings were conducted during those years.

By the time the [[International Opium Convention]] Treaty was registered with the League of Nations in 1922, Cheah became the President of the Anti-Opium Society. Consequently, in October 1923, a joint Federated Malay States petition for the abolition of the [[History of opium in China|opium trade]] was strengthened by 2,000 signatures. The ban on opium was finally applied 20 years after the beginning of the campaign. Cheah had dedicated 30 years of his life to the cause.

===Benevolent works===
*1904: Donated a plot of land for the construction of the first Ipoh Maternity Hospital
*1919: Instituted the Cheah Boon Hean Scholarship at his former school, King Edward VII School. 
*1922: Instituted the competitive Cheah Cheang Lim Scholarship in Anderson School, [[Anglo-Chinese Schools, Malaysia|Anglo-Chinese School]] and [[St. Michael's Institution]] in Ipoh.

===Cheah Kongsi===
Cheah belonged to the third generation of the Cheah family trustees of Cheah [[Kongsi]] (谢公司) in Penang, his grandfather and father before him. He was also appointed honorary secretary. In 1918, he revised the rules and regulations of the organization to adjust to those times. The new constitution was published in 1921. Moreover, he undertook research on the Cheah history and lineage in China, the Cheah Kongsi history and the family cemetery, and came up with a pictorial compilation.&lt;ref&gt;Tan Kim Hong, ''The Chinese in Penang: A Pictorial History''. Penang: Areca Books, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, he was exempted from the obligation of attending the monthly meetings, due to his increasing commitment to the [[Federated Malay States]]. From 1931 to 1933, after the President, Cheah Choo Yew, died, Cheah Cheang Lim contributed to the renovation of the Cheah Kongsi. In 1934, he resigned his trusteeship, after 17 years of service, from 1917 to 1934.

===Volunteering===
In 1924, Cheah was requested by Colonel Parr to instill the [[volunteering]] spirit of the [[Peranakan|Straits Chinese]] youth.&lt;ref name=lifeandtimes /&gt; He thus volunteered as a second lieutenant and appointed [[Officer Commanding]] (OC), Chinese Platoon 1, in the Malayan Volunteer Infantry in Perak. In 1930, he was promoted to lieutenant.

==Family Life==
In 1896, Cheah married Khoo Pek Hua, a Penang-born Straits Chinese woman. She died on 6 March 1930, due to illness and the grief of losing of three daughters within five years. She was buried at the Cheah family cemetery at [[Tikus Island|Pulau Tikus]], Penang. She left Cheang Lim with one son and one daughter, named Cheah Ghim Leng and Cheah Liew Pin, respectively. Ghim Leng was previously a sergeant in the Chinese Company of the Penang and Province Wellesley Volunteer Force, before taking over his father's business in Ipoh. Later, he was appointed Officer Commanding Chinese Platoon I, Malayan Volunteer Infantry, in Perak. In 1935, he was elected a justice of the peace. In the beginning of the year 1941, he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire]] and became a member of the Perak State Council.

Cheah remarried in July 1930. His second wife was an English-educated lady named Khoo Chin Choo. The couple adopted a girl named Cheah Liew Khin.

==Later Years==
After serving in the Federal Council, he retired from public life. He nevertheless hosted the occasional 'At Home', attended by honorable guests. Upon reaching 60 years of age, he hired Francis Cooray, author and journalist of [[The Malay Mail]] to write his biography. In 1946, he also helped in leading the formation of the second/third Penang Clerical Union&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 12 July 1937, Page 13. [http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19370712-1.2.94.aspx ''Penang Clerks' Union To Protect Interests''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheah died on 16 November 1948, aged 77, in his home, at Leith Street, Penang. He was buried at Pulau Tikus, Penang. ''Lorong Cheah Cheang Lim'' in Ipoh, Perak is named after him.

The term '''citizen enterprise''' started to be used in the United States in 2008 to describe businesses that practice [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR).

==Information==
In some countries, such as Papua New Guinea, the term is used to describe companies owned by citizens of that country, rather than by foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipa.gov.pg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=149&amp;Itemid=128 The Papua New Guinea Investment Promotion Agency - Citizen, National and Foreign Enterprises]&lt;/ref&gt;

It should not be confused with [[social enterprise]], which is a more complex notion involving origin, ownership and participation as well as objectives, activities and the use of profits.

'''Eastline Digital''' (formerly Eastline Marketing) is a [[digital marketing]] agency based in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.executive-magazine.com/special-report/The-top-20-Lebanese-entrepreneurs/1405|title=The Top Twenty Lebanese Entrepreneurs - Executive Magazine|date= |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first companies in the [[MENA region]] to offer a full range of online marketing services such as [[social media marketing]], paid search marketing (PSM), [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) and [[online advertising]].&lt;ref name=pleasure&gt;{{cite news |url= http://socialmediaweek.org/beirut/tag/eastline-marketing/|title= At Eastline Marketing, work is a pleasurable challenge awaiting to be tackled!|date= |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The agency was founded in 2006 by Marc Dfouni and Nemr Nicolas Badine.&lt;ref name=endeavor&gt;{{cite news |url= http://endeavorlebanon.org/blog/2012/04/ees-eastline-marketing-in-the-news/|title=Eastline Marketing in the News|date= |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to Eastline’s establishment, Dfouni was the general manager of a web interactive agency in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=dfouni&gt;{{cite news |url=http://creativeconomy.britishcouncil.org/people/marc-dfouni/|title= Marc Dfouni – British Council’s Creative Economy Program|date= |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badine meanwhile designed multimedia systems used in live performances by artists such as [[U2]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://eastlinemarketing.com/online-marketing-experts |title=Our Online Marketing Experts – Eastline Marketing|date= |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Eastline’s inception, the online marketing field was virtually nonexistent in the [[MENA]] region.&lt;ref name=entrepreneur&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.emergingstars.com/success-stories/entrepreneur-serves-middle-east-one-marketing-campaign-time  |title= Entrepreneur serves the Middle East one marketing campaign at a time|date= |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://endeavorlebanon.org/blog/2013/04/risk-nothing-and-gain-nothing-how-risk-avoidance-leads-to-failure-by-nemr-nicolas-badine-%E2%80%93-co-founder-eastline-marketing/  |title= Risk Nothing and Gain Nothing - Entrepreneurship Blog|date= |accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, little by little, [[Internet]] use in the [[Middle East]] began growing considerably. As a result of this, the agency started expanding its operations and working with clients based in [[Dubai]], [[Qatar]], [[Egypt]], [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=  http://www.ameinfo.com/173277.html
|title= Eastline Marketing Expands into MENA Region |date= |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''File sharing''' is the practice of distributing or providing access to [[digital media]], such as computer programs, [[multimedia]] (audio, images and video), documents or [[E-book|electronic books]]. File sharing may be achieved in a number of ways. Common methods of [[Computer data storage|storage]], [[Data transmission|transmission]] and dispersion include manual sharing utilizing removable media, centralized servers on [[computer network]]s, World Wide Web-based [[hyperlink]]ed documents, and the use of distributed [[peer-to-peer]] networking.

==Types==

===Peer-to-peer file sharing===
[[Peer-to-peer file sharing]] is based on the [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) application architecture. [[Shared resource|Shared files]] on the computers of other [[User (system)|users]] are indexed on directory servers. P2P technology was used by popular services like [[Napster]] and [[Limewire]]. The most popular protocol for P2P sharing is [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]].

===File sync and sharing services===
[[Cloud computing|Cloud-based]] [[file synchronization|file syncing and sharing]] services implement automated file transfers by updating files from a dedicated sharing directory on each user's networked devices. Files placed in this folder also are typically accessible through a website and mobile app, and can be easily shared with other users for viewing or collaboration. Such services have become popular via consumer-oriented [[file hosting service]]s such as [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] and [[Google Drive]].

[[rsync]] is a more traditional program released in 1996 which synchronizes files on a direct machine-to-machine basis.

[[Data synchronization]] in general can use other approaches to share files, such as [[distributed filesystem]]s, [[version control]], or [[Web mirror|mirrors]].

==History==
{{Main|File sharing timeline}}
&lt;!-- pre-1999 --&gt;Files were first exchanged on [[removable media]]. Computers were able to access remote files using [[filesystem]] mounting, [[bulletin board systems]] (1978), [[Usenet]] (1979), and [[FTP]] servers (1985). [[Internet Relay Chat]] (1988) and [[Hotline Communications|Hotline]] (1997) enabled users to communicate remotely through [[online chat|chat]] and to exchange files. The [[mp3]] encoding, which was standardized in 1991 and substantially reduced the size of [[Audio file format|audio files]], grew to widespread use in the late 1990s. In 1998, [[MP3.com]] and [[Audiogalaxy]] were established, the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] was unanimously passed, and the first [[Portable media player|mp3 player]] devices were launched.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In June 1999, [[Napster]] was released as an unstructured centralized peer-to-peer system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KeIENcC2BPwC&amp;pg=PA532&amp;lpg=PA532&amp;dq=napster+first#PPA532,M1 |title=Reliable distributed systems: technologies, Web services, and applications - Kenneth P. Birman - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905151657/https://books.google.com/books?id=KeIENcC2BPwC&amp;pg=PA532&amp;lpg=PA532&amp;dq=napster+first#PPA532,M1 |archivedate=September 5, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring a central server for indexing and peer discovery. It is generally credited as being the first peer-to-peer file sharing system.

[[Gnutella]], [[eDonkey2000]], and [[Freenet]] were released in 2000, as MP3.com and Napster were facing litigation. [[Gnutella]], released in March, was the first decentralized file sharing network. In the gnutella network, all connecting software was considered equal, and therefore the network had no [[Single point of failure|central point of failure]]. In July, [[Freenet]] was released and became the first anonymity network. In September the [[eDonkey2000]] client and server software was released.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2001, [[Kazaa]] and [[Poisoned]] for the Mac was released. Its [[FastTrack]] network was distributed, though unlike gnutella, it assigned more traffic to 'supernodes' to increase routing efficiency. The network was proprietary and encrypted, and the Kazaa team made substantial efforts to keep other clients such as [[Morpheus (computer program)|Morpheus]] off of the FastTrack network.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In July 2001, Napster was sued by several recording companies and lost in [[A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Menta | first=Richard | title=RIAA Sues Music Startup Napster for $20 Billion | date=December 9, 1999 | publisher=MP3 Newswire | url=http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/napster.html | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601112815/http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/napster.html | archivedate=June 1, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Napster, it has been ruled that an online service provider could not use the "transitory network transmission" safe harbor in the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] if they had control of the network with a server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w2.eff.org/IP/P2P/p2p_copyright_wp.php |title=EFF: What Peer-to-Peer Developers Need to Know about Copyright Law |publisher=W2.eff.org |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115034129/http://w2.eff.org/IP/P2P/p2p_copyright_wp.php |archivedate=January 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after its loss in court, Napster was shut down to comply with a court order. This drove users to other P2P applications and file sharing continued its growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Menta | first=Richard | title=Napster Clones Crush Napster.

Until its decline in 2004, Kazaa was the most popular file sharing program despite bundled [[malware]] and legal battles in the Netherlands, Australia, and the United States. In 2002, a Tokyo district court ruling shut down File Rogue, and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) filed a lawsuit that effectively shut down Audiogalaxy.

[[File:Pro piracy demonstration.jpg|thumb|Demonstrators protesting [[The Pirate Bay raid]] in 2006]]

From 2002 through 2003, a number of [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] services were established, including [[Suprnova.org]], [[isoHunt]], [[TorrentSpy]], and [[The Pirate Bay]]. In 2002, the RIAA was filing lawsuits against Kazaa users. As a result of such lawsuits, many universities added file sharing regulations in their school administrative codes (though some students managed to circumvent them during after school hours). With the shutdown of eDonkey in 2005, eMule became the dominant client of the eDonkey network. In 2006, police raids took down the [[Razorback2]] eDonkey server and temporarily took down [[The Pirate Bay]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

“The File Sharing Act was launched by Chairman Towns in 2009, this act prohibited the use of applications that allowed individuals to share federal information amongst one another. On the other hand, only specific file sharing application were made available to federal computers” (United States.Congress.House). In 2009, the [[Pirate Bay trial]] ended in a guilty verdict for the primary founders of the tracker. The decision was appealed, leading to a second guilty verdict in November 2010. In October 2010, Limewire was forced to shut down following a court order in [[Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC]] but the gnutella network remains active through open source clients like [[Frostwire]] and [[gtk-gnutella]]. Furthermore, multi-protocol file sharing software such as [[MLDonkey]] and [[Shareaza]] adapted in order to support all the major file sharing protocols, so users no longer had to install and configure multiple file sharing programs.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

On January 19, 2012, the [[United States Department of Justice]] shut down the popular domain of [[Megaupload]] (established 2005). The file sharing site has claimed to have over 50,000,000 people a day.&lt;ref name="megaupload_wp"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/department-of-justice-site-hacked-after-megaupload-shutdown-anonymous-claims-credit/2012/01/20/gIQAl5MNEQ_story.html?tid=pm_business_pop |title=Department of Justice site hacked after Megaupload shutdown, Anonymous claims credit.

==Public opinion of file sharing==
In 2004 there were an estimated 70 million people participating in online file sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/march17/fileshare-317.html |title=Law professors examine ethical controversies of peer-to-peer file sharing|last = Delgado |first = Ray |work=Stanford Report |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=March 17, 2004 |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625030926/http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/march17/fileshare-317.html |archivedate=June 25, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[CBS News]] poll in 2009, 58% of [[United States|Americans]] who follow the file sharing issue, considered it acceptable "if a person owns the music CD and shares it with a limited number of friends and acquaintances"; with 18- to 29-year-olds this percentage reached as much as 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/18/opinion/polls/main573990.shtml |title=Poll: Young Say File Sharing OK |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130162846/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/18/opinion/polls/main573990.shtml |archivedate=November 30, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his survey of file-sharing culture, Caraway (2012) noted that 74.4% of participants believed musicians should accept file sharing as a means for promotion and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1216/720|title = Survey of File-Sharing Culture|date = 2012|accessdate = November 25, 2015|website = [[International Journal of Communication]]|publisher = [[USC Annenberg Press]], [[Creative Commons license]] (by-nc-nd)|last = Caraway|first = Brett Robert |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090451/http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1216/720|archivedate = March 4, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic impact==
According to David Glenn, writing in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', "A majority of economic studies have concluded that file sharing hurts sales".&lt;ref name="HigherEdu"&gt;Glenn, David. Dispute Over the Economics of File Sharing Intensifies, ''[[Chronicle.com]]'', July 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A literature review by Professor Peter Tschmuck found 22 [[independent study|independent studies]] on the effects of music file sharing. "Of these 22 studies, 14 – roughly two-thirds – conclude that unauthorized downloads have a 'negative or even highly negative impact' on recorded music sales. Three of the studies found no significant impact while the remaining five found a positive impact."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Terry. [http://www.copyhype.com/2012/02/more-evidence-for-copyright-protection/ More Evidence for Copyright Protection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205093806/http://www.copyhype.com/2012/02/more-evidence-for-copyright-protection/ |date=February 5, 2012 }}, copyhype.com, February 1, 2012. "The literature review looked at a 23rd study but did not classify it here since the author presented a mixed conclusion: the overall effect of unauthorized downloads is insignificant, but for unknown artists, there is a 'strongly negative' effect on recorded music sales."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AJ Sokolov, Daniel . [http://www.heise.de/ct/meldung/Wissenschaftler-Studien-ueber-Tauschboersen-unbrauchbar-1020532.html Wissenschaftler: Studien über Tauschbörsen unbrauchbar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603034104/http://www.heise.de/ct/meldung/Wissenschaftler-Studien-ueber-Tauschboersen-unbrauchbar-1020532.html |date=June 3, 2013 }}, ''[[c't]]'' magazine, June 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by economists [[Felix Oberholzer-Gee]] and Koleman Strumpf in 2004 concluded that music file sharing's effect on sales was "statistically indistinguishable from zero".&lt;ref name="levine"&gt;Levine, Robert. ''Free Ride: How the Internet Is Destroying the Culture Business and How the Culture Business Can Fight Back'', Bodley Head,  February 2011, {{ISBN|1847921485}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Effect of File Sharing on Record Sales: An Empirical Analysis|last=Oberholzer|first=Felix|author2=Koleman Strumpf|accessdate=June 13, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613031108/http://www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf|archivedate=June 13, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research was disputed by other economists, most notably Stan Liebowitz, who said Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf had made multiple assumptions about the music industry "that are just not correct."&lt;ref name="levine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1014399|title=How Reliable is the Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf Paper on File-Sharing?|last=Liebowitz|first=Stan J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musicbusinessresearch.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/paper-stan-j-liebowitz1.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Key Instrument in the Oberholzer-Gee/Strumpf File-Sharing Paper is Defective|last=Liebowitz|first=Stan J.|accessdate=June 13, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827225353/http://musicbusinessresearch.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/paper-stan-j-liebowitz1.pdf|archivedate=August 27, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, ''Billboard'' reported that Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf had "changed their minds", now finding "no more than 20% of the recent decline in sales is due to sharing".&lt;ref&gt;Peoples, Glenn. [http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i82a006de3290b1a63323f3e4ee910ca9 Researchers Change Tune, Now Say P2P Has Negative Impact ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209002810/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i82a006de3290b1a63323f3e4ee910ca9 |date=December 9, 2010 }} ''Billboard''. June 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, citing [[Nielsen SoundScan]] as their source, the co-authors maintained that illegal downloading had not deterred people from being original. "In many creative industries, monetary incentives play a reduced role in motivating authors to remain creative. Data on the supply of new works are consistent with the argument that file sharing did not discourage authors and publishers. Since the advent of file sharing, the production of music, books, and movies has increased sharply."&lt;ref&gt;Oberholzer &amp; Strumpf. "File Sharing and Copyright" ''NBER Innovation Policy &amp; the Economy'', Vol. 10, No. 1, 2010. "Artists receive a significant portion of their remuneration not in monetary form – many of them enjoy fame, admiration, social status, and free beer in bars – suggesting a reduction in monetary incentives might possibly have a reduced impact on the quantity and quality of artistic production."&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn Peoples of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' disputed the underlying data, saying "SoundScan's number for new releases in any given year represents new commercial titles, not necessarily new creative works."&lt;ref&gt;Peoples, Glenn. [http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3ic193b6eacf48409b52f1ab027d2d2b6c Analysis: Are Musicians Losing the Incentive to Create?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103010017/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3ic193b6eacf48409b52f1ab027d2d2b6c |date=November 3, 2010 }} ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. July 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The RIAA likewise responded that "new releases" and "new creative works" are two separate things. "[T]his figure includes re-releases, new compilations of existing songs, and new digital-only versions of catalog albums. SoundScan has also steadily increased the number of retailers (especially non-traditional retailers) in their sample over the years, better capturing the number of new releases brought to market. What Oberholzer and Strumpf found was better ability to track new album releases, not greater incentive to create them."&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, Joshua P. &amp; Lamy, Jonathan. [http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/view_35.pdf Illegal Downloading = Fewer Musicians] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121074926/http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/view_35.pdf |date=January 21, 2012 }} ifpi.org, July 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study prepared by Birgitte Andersen and Marion Frenz, published by [[Industry Canada]], was "unable to discover any direct relationship between P2P file-sharing and CD purchases in Canada".&lt;ref&gt;[http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/ippd-dppi.nsf/en/h_ip01456e.html The Impact of Music Downloads and P2P File-Sharing on the Purchase of Music: A Study for Industry Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914010619/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/ippd-dppi.nsf/en/h_ip01456e.html |date=September 14, 2008 }}, Birgitte Andersen and Marion Frenz&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this survey were similarly criticized by academics and a subsequent revaluation of the same data by Dr. George R. Barker of the [[Australian National University]] reached the opposite conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Peoples, Glenn.

Only 25% of people say they would not have bought the music if it were not available on P2P for free." Barker thus concludes; "This clearly suggests P2P network availability is reducing music demand of 75% of music downloaders which is quite contrary to Andersen and Frenz's much published claim."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, George R.

According to the 2017 paper "Estimating displacement rates of copyrighted content in the EU" by the [[European Commission]], illegal usage increases game sales, stating "The overall conclusion is that for games, illegal online transactions induce more legal transactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2017/09/displacement_study.pdf|title=Estimating displacement rates of copyrighted content in the EU|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market dominance===
A paper in journal ''[[Operations Research: A Journal of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences|Management Science]]'' found that file sharing decreased the chance of survival for low ranked albums on music charts and increased exposure to albums that were ranked high on the music charts, allowing popular and well known artists to remain on the music charts more often. This had a negative impact for new and less known artists while promoting the work of already popular artists and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharjee, Sudip., Gopal, Ram D., Lertwachara, Kaveepan. Marsden, James R. &amp; Telang, Rahul. [http://mansci.journal.informs.org/content/53/9/1359.full.pdf+html The Effect of Digital Sharing Technologies on Music Markets: A Survival Analysis of Albums on Ranking Charts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214152135/http://mansci.journal.informs.org/content/53/9/1359.full.pdf+html |date=February 14, 2012 }} ''Management Science'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study that examined pre-release file sharing of music albums, using BitTorrent software, also discovered positive impacts for "established and popular artists but not newer and smaller artists." According to Robert G. Hammond of [[North Carolina State University]], an album that leaked one month early would see a modest increase in sales. "This increase in sales is small relative to other factors that have been found to affect album sales."

&lt;blockquote&gt;"File-sharing proponents commonly argue that file sharing democratizes music consumption by 'leveling the playing field' for new/small artists relative to established/popular artists, by allowing artists to have their work heard by a wider audience, lessening the advantage held by established/popular artists in terms of promotional and other support. My results suggest that the opposite is happening, which is consistent with evidence on file-sharing behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Hammond. Robert G. "[http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rghammon/Hammond_File_Sharing_Leak.pdf Profit Leak? Pre-Release File Sharing and the Music Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523032458/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rghammon/Hammond_File_Sharing_Leak.pdf |date=May 23, 2012 }}" May 2012. File sharing benefits mainstream albums such as pop music but not albums in niche genres such as indie music. ... Further, the finding that file sharing redistributes sales toward established/popular artists is inconsistent with claims made by proponents of file sharing that file sharing democratizes music consumption."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Billboard'' cautioned that this research looked only at the pre-release period and not continuous file sharing following a release date. "The problem in believing [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]] helps sales is deciding where to draw the line between legal and illegal ... Implicit in the study is the fact that both buyers and sellers are required in order for pre-release file sharing to have a positive impact on album sales. Without iTunes, Amazon and Best Buy, file-sharers would be just file sharers rather than purchasers. If you carry out the 'file sharing should be legal' argument to its logical conclusion, today's retailers will be tomorrow's file-sharing services that integrate with their respective cloud storage services."&lt;ref&gt;Peoples, Glenn.

===Availability===
Many argue that file-sharing has forced the owners of entertainment content to make it more widely available legally through fee or advertising on demand on the internet. In a 2011 report by [[Sandvine]] showed that [[Netflix]] traffic had come to surpass that of [[Bittorrent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/epicenter/2011/05/SandvineGlobalInternetSpringReport2011.pdf Global Internet Phenomena Report - Spring 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113020428/http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/epicenter/2011/05/SandvineGlobalInternetSpringReport2011.pdf |date=January 13, 2012 }} Sandvine Global Internet Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

==Copyright issues==
{{main|Legal aspects of file sharing}}
File sharing raises copyright issues and has led to many lawsuits. In the [[United States]], some of these lawsuits have even reached the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]. For example, in ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.|MGM v. Grokster]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that the creators of P2P networks can be held liable if their software is marketed as a tool for copyright infringement.

On the other hand, not all file sharing is illegal. Content in the [[public domain]] can be freely shared. Even works covered by [[copyright]] can be shared under certain circumstances. For example, some artists, publishers, and [[record label]]s grant the public a license for unlimited distribution of certain works, sometimes with conditions, and they advocate [[free content]] and file sharing as a promotional tool.

'''FinTech Awards''' are several award ceremonies, most of them unrelated, which are held all over the world to recognize excellence in [[financial technology]] as assessed by public vote and panels of judges. As a rule, there are many categories and prizes. Hundreds of companies, mostly [[startup company|startups]], participate as candidates.

As of 2016, major fintech awards ceremonies are held in [[India]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[South Africa]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[United States]]. Two ceremonies are not national but continental: the African FinTech Awards and Conference, and the European Fintech Awards.

The ''European FinTech Awards'' is an organization that aims to disrupt traditional financial intuitions by providing a platform for fintech [[entrepreneur]]s to collaborate with one another.&lt;ref name=Week&gt;{{cite web |url = http://paymentweek.com/2016-5-5-blockchain-firm-wins-eu-fintech-award-10432/ |title = Blockchain Firm Wins EU Fintech Award |author = Ryan Kennedy |publisher = Payment Week |date = 5 May 2016 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Dutch and African awards, the European awards are the result of an initiative of Alex van Groningen BV, a Dutch financial publisher.&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;{{cite web |url = http://hollandfintech.com/dutch-isnt-holland-fintech/ |title = Why Dutch isn’t the same as Holland in FinTech |publisher = Holland Fintech |date = 5 December 2015 |accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Froth flotation''' is a process for selectively separating [[hydrophobic]] materials from [[hydrophilic]]. This is used in mineral processing, [[paper recycling]] and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century. It has been described as "the single most important operation used for the recovery and upgrading of [[Sulfide#Geology|sulfide ores]]".&lt;ref&gt;G J Jameson, "Flotation cell development," in: ''The AusIMM Annual Conference, Broken Hill, New South Wales, 17–21 May 1992'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1992), 25–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[froth]] flotation has improved the recovery of valuable [[minerals]], such as [[copper]]- and [[lead]]-bearing minerals. Along with mechanized mining, it has allowed the economic recovery of valuable metals from much lower grade ore than previously.

==History==

=== 19th century ===
Descriptions of the use of a flotation process have been found in ancient Greek and Persian literature suggesting its antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Michael|title=”From 10 Cubic Feet to 500 Cubic Meters--Observations on 100 Years of Flotation Technology"|journal=Separation Technologies book edited by Courtney Young et al|date=2012|pages=539-546|publisher=Society of Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late nineteenth century, the process basics were discovered through a slow evolutionary phase; then, during the first decade of the twentieth century, a more rapid investigation of oils, froths, and agitation led to proven work-place applications, especially at Broken Hill, Australia, that brought the technological innovation known as “froth flotation.”  During the early twentieth century, it truly and dramatically revolutionized -- an overworked term, but accurate here -- mineral processing around the globe.

Initially, naturally occurring chemicals such as [[fatty acid]]s and oils were used as flotation [[reagent]]s in a large quantity to increase the hydrophobicity of the valuable minerals. Since then, the process has been adapted and applied to a wide variety of materials to be separated, and additional collector agents, including [[surfactants]] and synthetic compounds have been adopted for various applications.

Englishman William Haynes patented a process in 1860 for separating [[sulfide]] and [[gangue]] minerals using oil.  Later writers have pointed to Haynes's as the first "bulk oil flotation" patent, though there is no evidence of its ever being field tested, let alone used commercially.  While in 1877 the brothers Bessel (Adolph and August) of Dresden, Germany, introduced their commercially successful oil and froth flotation process for extracting [[graphite]], considered by some the root of froth flotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nguyen|first1=Ahn|title=Colloidal Science of Flotation|date=2003|isbn=0824747828|pages=11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, because the Bessel process was used on graphite not gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, etc, their work has been ignored by most historians of the technology. Seventy-seven year old inventor Hezekiah Bradford of Philadelphia imitated their work and patented a similar process in 1885.  He had received his first patent in 1834, primarily invented machinery to separate slate from coal during the 1850s-1860s, and perfected the Bradford Breaker, still in use by the coal industry today, but it is uncertain if his 1885 patented "flotation" process was successfully introduced in the graphite deposits in nearby Chester County, Pennsylvania.

In 1885 [[Carrie Everson]] patented a process calling for oil[s] but also an acid or a salt, a significant step in the evolution of the process history.  By 1890, tests of the Everson process had been made at Georgetown and Silver Cliff, Colorado, and Baker, Oregon.  She abandoned the work with the death of her husband, and before perfecting a commercial successful process.  Later, during the height of legal disputes over the validity or not of various patents during the 1910s, Everson's was often pointed to as the initial flotation patent -- which would have meant that the process was not patentable again by later contestants.  Much confusion has been clarified recently by historian Dawn Bunyak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunyak|first1=Dawn|title=The Inventor, the Patent, and Carrie Everson: Defining Success|journal=Mining History Journal|date=2005|pages=9-24|url=https://www.mininghistoryassociation.org/Journal/MHJ-v12-2005-Bunyak.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First commercial flotation process ===
The generally recognized first successful commercial flotation process for ''mineral'' [[Sulfide|sulphides]] was invented by Frank Elmore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maelgwyn.com/birthplaceflotation.html#top|accessdate=2010-01-13|title=Wales - The birthplace of Flotation}}&lt;/ref&gt; who worked on the development with his brother, Stanley. The Glasdir copper mine at [[Llanelltyd]], near [[Dolgellau]] in [[North Wales]] was bought in 1896 by the Elmore brothers in conjunction with their father, William. In 1897, the Elmore brothers installed the world's first industrial size commercial flotation process for mineral beneficiation at the Glasdir mine. The process was not froth flotation but used oil to agglomerate (make balls of) pulverised sulphides and [[Buoyancy|buoy]] them to the surface, and was patented in 1898 with a description of the process published in 1903 in the ''Engineering and Mining Journal''. By this time they had recognized the importance of air bubbles in assisting the oil to carry away the mineral particles. The Elmores had formed a company known as the Ore Concentration Syndicate Ltd to promote the commercial use of the process worldwide. Charles Butters of Berkeley, California, acquired American rights to Elmores' process, and developed what was known to contemporaries as the "Butters Process".  Butters, an expert on the [[Gold cyanidation|cyanide process]], tried lab test of the Elmore process on gold ores without success. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rickard|first=Thomas A.|title=Interviews with Mining Engineers|year=1922|publisher=Mining and Scientific Press|location=San Francisco|pages=119–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However developments elsewhere, particularly in [[Broken Hill, Australia]] by [[Minerals Separation, Limited]], led to decades of hard fought legal battles and litigations which, ultimately, were lost as the Elmore process was superseded by more advanced techniques. Another flotation process was independently invented in the early 1900s in Australia by Charles Vincent Potter and around the same time by [[Guillaume Daniel Delprat]].&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last=Osborne |first=Graeme |id2=delprat-guillaume-daniel-5947 |title=Guillaume Daniel Delprat |year=1981 |accessdate= 7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/guides/mine/historicalnote.htm|title=Historical Note|accessdate=2007-12-30|publisher=Minerals Separation Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process (developed circa 1902) did not use oil, but relied upon flotation by the generation of gas formed by the introduction of acid into the pulp. In 1902, Froment combined oil and gaseous flotation using a modification of the Potter-Delprat process.  During the first decade of the twentieth century, Broken Hill became the center of innovation leading to the perfection of the froth flotation process by many technologists there borrowing from each other and building on these first successes.

Yet another process was developed in 1902 by Cattermole, who emulsified the pulp with a small quantity of oil, subjected it to violent agitation, then slow stirring which coagulated the target minerals into nodules which were separated from the pulp by gravity. The Minerals Separation Ltd., formed in Britain in 1903 to acquire the Cattermole patent, found that it proved unsuccessful.  Metallurgists on the staff continued to test and combine other discoveries to patent in 1905 their process, called the Sulman-Picard-Ballot process after company officers and patentees. The process proved successful at their Central Block plant, Broken Hill that year.  Significant in their "agitation froth flotation" process was the use of less than 1% oil and an agitation step that created small bubbles, which provided more surface to capture the metal and float into to a froth at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malozemoff|first1=Plato|title=“Operating Characteristics of Mechanical Flotation Machines,”|journal=Engineering &amp; Mining Journal|date=March 1941|page=45-49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mineral Separation also bought other patents to consolidate ownership of any potential conflicting rights to the flotation process--except for the Elmore patents.  In 1910, when the Zinc Corporation replaced its Elmore process with the Minerals Separation (Sulman-Picard-Ballot) froth flotation process at its Broken Hill plant, the primacy of the Minerals Separation over other process contenders was assured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mouat|first1=Jeremy|title=The Development of the Flotation Process: Technological Change and the Genesis of Modern Mining, 1898-1911|journal=Australian Economic Review|date=March 1996|volume=36|issue=1|pages=3-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry Livingston Sulman was later recognized by his peers in his election as President of the British Institution of Mining and Metallurgy, which also awarded him its gold medal. 

=== 1900s ===
Developments in the United States had been less than spectacular.  Butters's failures, as well as others, was followed after 1904, with Scotsman Stanley MacQuisten's process (a surface tension based method), which was developed with a [[modicum]] of success in Nevada and Idaho, but this would not work when [[Tailings|slimes]] were present, a major fault.  Henry E. Wood of Denver had developed his flotation process along the same lines in 1907, patented 1911, with some success on molybdenum ores.  For the most part, however, these were isolated attempts without fanfare for what can only be called marginal successes.  

In 1911, [[James M. Hyde]], a former employee of Minerals Separation, Ltd., modified the Minerals Separation process and installed a test plant in the Butte and Superior Mill in [[Basin, Montana]], the first such installation in the USA.  In 1912, he designed the Butte &amp; Superior zinc works, Butte, Montana, the first great flotation plant in America.&lt;ref&gt;Callow; 1916&lt;/ref&gt;  Minerals Separation, Ltd., which had set up an office in San Francisco, sued Hyde for infringement as well as the Butte &amp; Superior company, both cases were eventually won by the firm in the U. S. Supreme Court.  [[Daniel Cowan Jackling]] and partners, who controlled Butte &amp; Superior, also refuted the Minerals Separation patent and funded the ensuing legal battles that lasted over a decade.  They -- Utah Copper (Kennecott), Nevada Consolidated, Chino Copper, Ray Con and other Jackling firms -- eventually settled, in 1922, paying a substantial fee for licenses to use the Minerals Separation process.  One unfortunate result of the dispute was professional divisiveness among the mining engineering community for a generation.

In 1913, the Minerals Separation paid for a test plant for the Inspiration Copper Company at Miami, Arizona.  Built under the San Francisco office director, Edward Nutter, it proved a success.  Inspiration engineer [[L. D. Ricketts]] ripped out a gravity concentration mill and replaced it with the Minerals Separation process, the first major use of the process at an American copper mine.  A major holder of Inspiration stock were men who controlled the great Anaconda mine of Butte.  They immediately followed the Inspiration success to build a Minerals Separation licensed plant at Butte, in 1915-1916, a major statement about the final acceptance of the Minerals Separation patented process.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parsons|first1=A. B.|title=The Porphyry Coppers|date=1933|publisher=American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers|location=New York|pages=239-246, 446-450}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

John M. Callow, of General Engineering of [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], had followed flotation from technical papers and the introduction in both the Butte and Superior Mill, and at Inspiration Copper in Arizona and determined that mechanical agitation was a drawback to the existing technology. Introducing a porous brick with compressed air, and a mechanical stirring mechanism, Callow applied for a patent in 1914 (some say that Callow, a Jackling partisan, invented his cell as a means to avoid paying royalties to Minerals Separation, which firms using his cell eventually were forced to do by the courts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rickard|first=Thomas A.|title=Interviews with Mining Engineers|year=1922|publisher=Mining and Scientific Press|location=San Francisco|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method, known as Pneumatic Flotation, was recognized as an alternative to the Minerals Separation process of flotation concentration.&lt;ref&gt;A detailed description of the history of flotation and this process can be found in Callows "Notes on Flotation" found in the ''Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers''; Vol 53-54, originally presented in New York in February 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Institute of Mining Engineers]] presented Callow the James Douglas Gold Medal in 1926 for his contributions to the field of flotation.  By that time, flotation technology was changing, especially with the discovery of the use of xanthates and other reagents, which made the Callow cell and his process obsolete.

Montana Tech professor [[Antoine Marc Gaudin]] defined the early period of flotation as the mechanical phase while by the late 1910s it entered the chemical phase.  Discoveries in reagents, especially the use of xanthates patented by Minerals Separations chemist Cornelius H. Keller, not so much increased the capture of minerals through the process as making it far more manageable in day to day operations.  Minerals Separation's initial flotation patents ended 1923, and new ones for chemical processes gave it a significant position into the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaudin,|first1=A. M.|title=Flotation|date=1932|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period the company also developed and patented flotation processes for iron out of its Hibbing lab and of phosphate in its Florida lab.  Another rapid phase of flotation process innovation did not occur until after 1960.

In the 1960s the froth flotation technique was adapted for [[deinking]] [[recycled paper]].

The success of the process is evinced by the number of claimants as "discoverers" of flotation.  In 1961, American engineers celebrated "50 years of flotation" and enshrined James Hyde and his Butte &amp; Superior mill.  In 1977, German engineers celebrated the "hundredth anniversary of flotation" based on the brothers Bessel patent of 1877.  The historic Glasdir copper mine site advertises its tours in Wales as site of the "discovery of flotation" based upon the Elmore brothers work.  Recent writers, because of the interest in celebrating women in science, champion Carrie Everson of Denver as mother of the process based on her 1885 patent.  Omitted from this list are the engineers, metallurgists and chemists of Minerals Separation, Ltd., which, at least in the American and Australian courts, won control of froth flotation patents as well as right of claimant as discoverers of froth flotation.  But, as historian Martin Lynch writes, "Mineral Separation would eventually prevail after taking the case to the US Supreme Court [and the House of Lords], and in so doing earned for itself the cordial detestation of many in the mining world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lynch |first1=Martin |title=Mining in World History |date=2002 |publisher=Reaktion Press |location=London |isbn=978-1-86189-173-0 |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Froth flotation is a process for separating minerals from gangue by taking advantage of differences in their [[hydrophobicity]]. Hydrophobicity differences between valuable minerals and waste gangue are increased through the use of surfactants and wetting agents. The selective separation of the minerals makes processing complex (that is, mixed) ores economically feasible. The flotation process is used for the separation of a large range of [[sulfide]]s, [[carbonate]]s and [[oxide]]s prior to further refinement. [[Phosphates]] and [[coal]] are also upgraded (purified) by flotation technology.

Prior to 1907, nearly all the copper mined in the US came from underground vein deposits, averaging 2.5 percent copper.&lt;ref name = "Wills"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wills | first1 = B A | last2 = Atkinson | first2 = K | year = 1991 | title = The development of minerals engineering in the 20th Century | url = | journal = Minerals Engineering | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 643–652 | doi=10.1016/0892-6875(91)90054-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1991, the average grade of copper ore mined in the US had fallen to only 0.6 percent.&lt;ref name = "Wills"/&gt;

===Waste water treatment===
The [[Continuous foam separation|flotation process]] is also widely used in industrial waste water treatment plants, where it removes fats, oil, grease and suspended solids from waste water. These units are called [[dissolved air flotation]] (DAF) units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]]| edition=1st | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. | year=1967 | id=[[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN 67019834]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, dissolved air flotation units are used in removing oil from the wastewater [[effluent]]s of [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and [[chemical plant]]s, [[Natural gas processing|natural gas processing plants]] and similar industrial facilities.

===Paper recycling===
{{Main article|Deinking}}
Froth flotation is one of the processes used to recover [[recycled paper]]. In the [[paper industry]] this step is called deinking or just flotation. The target is to release and remove the hydrophobic contaminants from the recycled paper. The contaminants are mostly [[printing ink]] and [[Stickies (papermaking)|stickies]]. Normally the setup is a two-stage system with 3,4 or 5 flotation cells in series.&lt;ref&gt;Voith EcoCell flotation plant {{cite web |url=http://www.voithpaper.com/applications/productsearch/files/594_VPR-PB-07-0001-GB-07.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824075218/http://www.voithpaper.com/applications/productsearch/files/594_VPR-PB-07-0001-GB-07.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle of operation==
Before froth flotation can work, the ore to be treated is reduced to fine particles by crushing and grinding (a process known as [[comminution]]) so that the various minerals exist as physically separate grains. This process is known as ''liberation''. The particle sizes are typically less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm (100&amp;nbsp;µm), but sometimes sizes smaller than 7–10&amp;nbsp;µm are required.&lt;ref&gt;D N Nihill, C M Stewart and P Bowen, "The McArthur River mine—the first years of operation," in: ''AusIMM ’98 – The Mining Cycle, Mount Isa, 19–23 April 1998'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1998), 73–82.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tendency for the liberation size of the minerals to decrease over time as the ore bodies with coarse mineral grains that can be separated at larger sizes are depleted and replaced by ore bodies that were formerly considered too difficult.

In the mining industry, the plants where flotation is undertaken to concentrate [[ore]] are generally known as ''concentrators'' or ''mills''.

For froth flotation, the ground ore is mixed with water to form a [[slurry]] and the desired mineral is rendered hydrophobic by the addition of a surfactant or ''collector'' chemical (although some mineral surfaces are naturally hydrophobic,&lt;ref&gt;E V Manlapig, C Green, J W Parkinson and A S Murphy, "The technology and economic incentives for recovering coal from tailings impoundments," ''SME Annual Meeting, Denver, Colorado, 26–28 February 2001, Preprint 01-70'' (Society of Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration: Littleton, Colorado, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; requiring little or no addition of collector). The particular chemical depends on the nature of the mineral to be recovered and, perhaps, the natures of those that are not wanted. As an example, [[sodium ethyl xanthate]] may be added as a collector in the selective flotation of [[galena]] (lead sulfide) to separate it from [[sphalerite]] (zinc sulfide). This slurry (more properly called the ''pulp'') of hydrophobic particles and hydrophilic particles is then introduced to tanks known as ''flotation cells'' that are aerated to produce bubbles. The hydrophobic particles attach to the air bubbles, which rise to the surface, forming a froth.&lt;ref name="linmahanglead" /&gt; The froth is removed from the cell, producing a concentrate ("con") of the target mineral.

Frothing agents, known as ''frothers'', may be introduced to the pulp to promote the formation of a stable froth on top of the flotation cell.

The minerals that do not float into the froth are referred to as the ''flotation tailings'' or ''flotation tails''. These tailings may also be subjected to further stages of flotation to recover the valuable particles that did not float the first time. This is known as ''scavenging''. The final tailings after scavenging are normally pumped for disposal as mine fill or to tailings disposal facilities for long-term storage.

Froth flotation efficiency is determined by a series of probabilities: those of particle–bubble contact, particle–bubble attachment, transport between the pulp and the froth, and froth collection into the product launder.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson 1993"&gt;B W Atkinson, C J Conway and G J Jameson, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/technical%20papers/Fundamentals%20of%20Jameson%20Cell%20Operation%20including%20Size-Yield%20Respone%20-%20Atkinson%20Conway%20Jameson.pdf "Fundamentals of Jameson Cell operation including size–yield response,"] in: ''Sixth Australian Coal Preparation Conference, Mackay, Queensland, 6–9 September 1993'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; In a conventional mechanically-agitated cell, the void fraction (i.e. volume occupied by air bubbles) is low (5 to 10 percent) and the bubble size is usually greater than 1&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson 1995"/&gt; This results in a relatively low interfacial area and a low probability of particle–bubble contact.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson 1995"&gt;B W Atkinson, C J Conway and G J Jameson, "High-efficiency flotation of coarse and fine coal," in: ''High-efficiency Coal Preparation: An International Symposium,'' (Society of Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration: Littleton, Colorado, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, several cells in series are required to increase the particle residence time, thus increasing the probability of particle–bubble contact.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson 1995"/&gt;

Flotation is normally undertaken in several stages to maximize the recovery of the target mineral or minerals and the concentration of those minerals in the concentrate, while minimizing the energy input.&lt;ref name = "Pease"&gt;J Pease, "[http://www.isamill.com/EN/Downloads/Downloaded%20Technical%20Papers/Joe_Pease.pdf Increasing the energy efficiency of grinding]," Presented at: ''Crushing and Grinding, Brisbane, September 2007.'' Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flotation stages===

====Roughing====
The first stage is called ''roughing'', which produces a ''rougher concentrate''. The objective is to remove the maximum amount of the valuable mineral at as coarse a particle size as practical.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt; The finer an ore is ground, the greater the energy that is required, so it makes sense to fine grind only those particles that need fine grinding.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt; Complete liberation is not required for rougher flotation, only sufficient liberation to release enough gangue from the valuable mineral to get a high recovery.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt;

The primary objective of roughing is to recover as much of the valuable minerals as possible, with less emphasis on the quality of the concentrate produced.

In some concentrators, there may be a ''preflotation'' step that precedes roughing.&lt;ref name = "Smith"&gt;T Smith, D Lin, B Lacouture and G Anderson, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/technical%20papers/Removal%20of%20Organic%20Carbon%20with%20a%20Jameson%20Cell%20at%20R.pdf "Removal of organic carbon with a Jameson Cell at Red Dog Mine,"] in: ''Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Canadian Mineral Processors, Ottawa, Ontario, 22–24 January 2008''. Accessed 6 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This is done when there are some undesirable materials, such as organic carbon, that readily float.&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt; They are removed first to avoid them floating during roughing (and thus contaminating the rougher concentrate).

====Cleaning====
The rougher concentrate is normally subjected to further stages of flotation to reject more of the undesirable minerals that also reported to the froth, in a process known as ''cleaning''.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt; The product of cleaning is known as the ''cleaner concentrate'' or the ''final concentrate''.

The objective of cleaning is to produce as high a concentrate grade as possible.

The rougher concentrate is often subject to further grinding (usually called ''regrinding'') to get more complete liberation of the valuable minerals.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt; Because it is a smaller mass than that of the original ore, less energy is needed than would be necessary if the whole ore were reground.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt; Regrinding is often undertaken in specialized ''regrind mills'', such as the [[IsaMill]], designed to further reduce the energy consumed during regrinding to finer sizes.

====Scavenging====
The rougher flotation step is often followed by a ''scavenger'' flotation step that is applied to the rougher tailings. The objective is to recover any of the target minerals that were not recovered during the initial roughing stage. This might be achieved by changing the flotation conditions to make them more rigorous than the initial roughing, or there might be some secondary grinding to provide further liberation.

The concentrate from the rougher scavengers could be returned to the rougher feed for refloating or sent to special cleaner cells.

Similarly, the cleaning step may also be followed by a scavenging step performed on the cleaner tailings.

==Science of flotation==
To be effective on a given ore slurry, the collectors are chosen based upon their selective [[wetting]] of the types of particles to be separated.  A good collector will [[adsorb]], physically or chemically, with one of the types of particles. This provides the thermodynamic requirement for the particles to bind to the surface of a bubble.  The wetting activity of a surfactant on a particle can be quantified by measuring the [[contact angle]]s that the liquid/bubble interface makes with it. Another important measure for attachment of bubbles to particles is induction time. The induction time is the time required for the particle and bubble to rupture the thin film separating the particle and bubble. This rupturing is achieved by the surface forces between the particle and bubble.

The mechanisms for the bubble-particle attachment is very complex and consists of three steps, collision, attachment and detachment. The collision is achieved by particles being within the collision tube of a bubble and this is affected by the velocity of the bubble and radius of the bubble. The collision tube corresponds to the region in which a particle will collide with the bubble, with the perimeter of the collision tube corresponding to the grazing trajectory.

The attachment of the particle to the bubble is controlled by the induction time of the particle and bubble. The particle and bubble need to bind and this occurs if the time in which the particle and bubble are in contact with each other is larger than the required induction time. This induction time is affected by the fluid viscosity, particle and bubble size and the forces between the particle and bubbles.

The detachment of a particle and bubble occurs when the force exerted by the surface tension is exceeded by shear forces and gravitational forces. These forces are complex and vary within the cell. High shear will be experienced close to the impeller of a mechanical flotation cell and mostly gravitational force in the collection and cleaning zone of a flotation column.

Significant issues of entrainment of fine particles occurs as these particles experience low collision efficiencies as well as sliming and degradation of the particle surfaces. Coarse particles show a low recovery of the valuable mineral due to the low liberation and high detachment efficiencies.

===Theory===

====Selective adhesion====
Froth flotation depends on the selective adhesion of air bubbles to mineral surfaces in a mineral/water slurry. The air bubbles will attach to more [[hydrophobic]] particles. The attachment of the bubbles to the surface is determined by the interfacial energies between the solid, liquid, and gas phases. This is determined by the [[wetting|Young-Dupré Equation]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kawatra|first1=S.K.|title=Flotation Fundamentals|url=http://www.chem.mtu.edu/chem_eng/faculty/kawatra/Flotation_Fundamentals.pdf|website=MTU Chemistry|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \gamma_{lv} \text{cos} \theta = (\gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl})&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* γ&lt;sub&gt;lv&lt;/sub&gt; is the surface energy of the liquid/vapor interface
* γ&lt;sub&gt;sv&lt;/sub&gt; is the surface energy of the solid/vapor interface
* γ&lt;sub&gt;sl&lt;/sub&gt; is the surface energy of the solid/liquid interface,
* θ is the [[contact angle]], the angle formed at the junction between vapor, solid, and liquid phases.

Minerals targeted for separation may be chemically surface-modified with collectors so that they are more hydrophobic. Collectors are a type of [[surfactant]] that increase the natural hydrophobicity of the surface, increasing the [[Separation process|separability]] of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles. Collectors either chemically bond via [[chemisorption]] to the mineral or adsorb onto the surface via [[physisorption]].

[[File:Collectors.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Different types of collectors, or surfactants, used in froth flotation.]]

====IMFs and surface forces in bubble-particle interactions====

=====Collision=====
The collision rates for fine particles (50 - 80 μm) can be accurately modeled, but there is no current theory that accurately models bubble-particle collision for particles as large as 300 μm, which are commonly used in flotation processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nguyen|first1=Anh V|title=On modelling of bubble–particle attachment probability in flotation|journal=International Journal of Mineral Processing|date=12 June 1996|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301751697000732|doi=10.1016/S0301-7516(97)00073-2|volume=53|pages=225–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For fine particles, [[Stokes' law|Stokes law]] underestimates collision probability while the potential equation based on [[surface charge]] overestimates collision probability so an intermediate equation is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shahbazi|first1=B.|title=Bubble–particle collision and attachment probability on fine particles flotation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0255270110001029|journal=Chemical Engineering and Processing: Process Intensification|doi=10.1016/j.cep.2010.04.009|volume=49|pages=622–627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to know the collision rates in the system since this step precedes the adsorption where a three phase system is formed.

=====Adsorption (attachment)=====
The effectiveness of a medium to adsorb to a particle is influenced by the relationship between the surfaces of both materials. There are multiple factors that affect the efficiency of adsorption in chemical, thermodynamic, and physical domains. These factors can range from surface energy and polarity to the shape, size, and roughness of the particle. In froth flotation, adsorption is a strong consequence of surface energy, since the small particles have a high surface area to size ratio, resulting in higher energy surfaces to form attractions with adsorbates. The air bubbles must selectively adhere to the desired minerals to elevate them to the surface of the slurry while wetting the other minerals and leaving them in the aqueous slurry medium.

Particles that can be easily wetted by water are called hydrophilic, while particles that are not easily wetted by water are called hydrophobic. Hydrophobic particles have a tendency to form a separate phase in aqueous media. In froth flotation the effectiveness of an air bubble to adhere to a particle is based on how hydrophobic the particle is. Hydrophobic particles have an affinity to air bubbles, leading to adsorption. The bubble-particle combinations are elevated to the froth zone driven by buoyancy forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kawatra|first1=S.K.|title=Flotation Fundamentals|url=http://www.chem.mtu.edu/chem_eng/faculty/kawatra/Flotation_Fundamentals.pdf|website=MTU Chemistry|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attachment of the bubbles to the particles is determined by the interfacial energies of between the solid, liquid, and vapor phases, as modeled by the Young/Dupre Equation. The interfacial energies can be based on the natural structure of the materials, or the addition of chemical treatments can improve energy compatibility.

Collectors are the main additives used to improve particle surfaces. They function as surfactants to selectively isolate and aid adsorption between the particles of interest and bubbles rising through the slurry. Common collectors used in flotation are anionic sulfur ligands, which have a bifunctional structure with an ionic portion which shares attraction with metals, and a hydrophobic portion such as a long hydrocarbon tail. These collectors coat a particle’s surface with a monolayer of non-polar substance to aid separation from the aqueous phase by decreasing the adsorbed particle solubility in water. The adsorbed ligands can form micelles around the particles and form small-particle colloids improving stability and phase separation further.

=====Desorption (detachment)=====
The adsorption of particles to bubbles is essential to separating the minerals from the slurry, but the minerals must be purified from the additives used in separation, such as the collectors, frothers, and modifiers. The product of the cleaning, or desorption process, is known as the cleaner concentrate. 
The detachment of a particle and bubble requires adsorption bond cleavage driven by shear forces. Depending on the flotation cell type, shear forces are applied by a variety of mechanical systems. Among the most common are impellers and mixers. Some systems combine the functionalities of these components by placing them at key locations where they can take part in multiple froth flotation mechanisms. Cleaning cells also take advantage of gravitational forces to improve separation efficiency.

====Performance calculations====

=====Relevant equations=====
A common quantity used to describe the collection efficiency of a froth flotation process is ''flotation recovery'' (&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;). This quantity incorporates the probabilities of [[Froth flotation#Science of flotation|collision]] and [[Froth flotation#Science of flotation|attachment]] of particles to gas flotation bubbles.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{N_c} {\left(\tfrac{\pi}{4}\right)\left(d_p+d_b\right)^2 Hc}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
where:
* &lt;math&gt;N_c = PN_c^i&lt;/math&gt;, which is the product of the probability of the particle being collected (&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;) and the number of possible particle collisions (&lt;math&gt;N_c^i&lt;/math&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;d_p&lt;/math&gt; is particle diameter
* &lt;math&gt;d_b&lt;/math&gt; is bubble diameter
* &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a specified height within the flotation which the recovery was calculated
* &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the particle concentration
&lt;br /&gt;
The following, are several additional mathematical methods often used to evaluate the effectiveness of froth flotation processes. These equations are more simple than the calculation for ''flotation recovery'', as they are based solely on the amounts of inputs and outputs of the processes.&lt;ref&gt;Kawatra, S. K. "Froth Flotation – Fundamental Principles." (n.d.): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the following equations:
* &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the weight percent of feed
* &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the weight percent concentrate
* &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the weight percent of tailings
* &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are the [[metallurgical assay]]s of the concentrate, tailings, and feed, respectively
&lt;br /&gt;
Ratio of feed weight to concentrate weight &lt;math&gt;\tfrac {F}{C}&lt;/math&gt; (unitless)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \frac{F}{C} = \frac{c-t}{f-t}&lt;/math&gt;

Percent of metal recovered (&lt;math&gt;\Chi_R&lt;/math&gt;) in wt''%''
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Chi_R = 100\left(\frac{c}{f}\right)\left(\frac{f-t}{c-t}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Percent of metal lost (&lt;math&gt;\Chi_L&lt;/math&gt;) in wt''%''
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Chi_L = 100 - \Chi_R&lt;/math&gt;

Percent of weight recovered &lt;math&gt;\left(\Chi_W\right)&lt;/math&gt; in wt''%''
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Chi_W = 100\left(\frac{C}{F}\right) = 100\frac{f-t}{c-t}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Shifts_in_Recovery_Curves.png|thumb|Example grade-recovery relationships seen in froth flotation. Shifts in the curves represent changes in flotation effectiveness.]]

=====Grade-recovery curves=====

Grade-recovery curves are useful tools in weighing the trade-off of producing a high grade of concentrate while maintaining as low of a recovery rate as possible, two important aspects of froth flotation. These curves are developed empirically based on the individual froth flotation process of a particular plant. As the curves are shifted in the positive x-direction (to the right) and the positive y-direction (upward) the performance of the froth flotation process is regarded as improving. A disadvantage to these curves is that they can only compare the grade-recovery relations of a specific feed grade and feed rate. If a company has a variance of feed grades and rates used (an extremely common occurrence) in their froth flotation process, grade-recovery curves for every pairing of feed grade and recovery rate would have to be constructed in order to provide meaningful information to the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Neethling, S.j., and J.j. Cilliers. "Grade-recovery Curves: A New Approach for Analysis of and Predicting from Plant Data." ''Minerals Engineering'' 36-38 (2012): 105-10. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flotation equipment ==
[[Image:FlCell.PNG|thumb|240px|right|Diagram of froth flotation cell. Numbered triangles show direction of stream flow.  A mixture of ore and water called pulp [1] enters the cell from a conditioner, and flows to the bottom of the cell.  Air [2] or nitrogen is passed down a vertical impeller where shearing forces break the air stream into small bubbles.  The mineral concentrate froth is collected from the top of the cell [3], while the pulp [4] flows to another cell.]]

Flotation can be performed in rectangular or cylindrical mechanically agitated cells or tanks, flotation columns, [[Jameson Cell]]s or deinking flotation machines. Classified by the method of air absorption manner, it is fair to state that two distinct groups of flotation equipments have arisen:pneumatic and mechanical machines. Generally pneumatic machines give a low-grade concentrate and little operating troubles.
[[File:Jameson Cells pictured adjacent to flotation columns at the Mount Isa lead-zinc concentrator.png|thumbnail|left|Comparison of the sizes of flotation columns and [[Jameson Cell]]s with similar capacities.]]

Mechanical cells use a large mixer and diffuser mechanism at the bottom of the mixing tank to introduce air and provide mixing action.  '''Flotation columns''' use air [[Sparging (chemistry)|sparger]]s to introduce air at the bottom of a tall column while introducing slurry above.  The countercurrent motion of the slurry flowing down and the air flowing up provides mixing action.  Mechanical cells generally have a higher throughput rate, but produce material that is of lower quality, while flotation columns generally have a low throughput rate but produce higher quality material.

The Jameson cell uses neither impellers nor spargers, instead combining the slurry with air in a downcomer where high shear creates the turbulent conditions required for bubble particle contacting.

== Mechanics of flotation ==
[[Image:FlCirc.PNG|thumb|300px|right]]
The following steps are followed, following grinding to liberate the mineral particles:
# Reagent conditioning to achieve hydrophobic surface charges on the desired particles
# Collection and upward transport by bubbles in an intimate contact with air or nitrogen
# Formation of a stable froth on the surface of the flotation cell
# Separation of the mineral laden froth from the bath (flotation cell)

'''Simple flotation circuit for mineral concentration.'''  Numbered triangles show direction of stream flow.  Various flotation reagents are added to a mixture of ore and water (called pulp) in a conditioning tank.  The flow rate and tank size are designed to give the minerals enough time to be activated.  The conditioner pulp [1] is fed to a bank of rougher cells which remove most of the desired minerals as a concentrate.  The rougher pulp [2] passes to a bank of scavenger cells where additional reagents may be added.  The scavenger cell froth [3] is usually returned to the rougher cells for additional treatment, but in some cases may be sent to special cleaner cells.  The scavenger pulp is usually barren enough to be discarded as tails.  More complex flotation circuits have several sets of cleaner and re-cleaner cells, and intermediate re-grinding of pulp or concentrate.

== Chemicals of flotation ==
[[File:Prominenthill-flotation.jpg|thumb|Copper sulfide foam in a froth-flotation cell]]
&lt;!-- sodiumn hydrate is of significant value to this separation process. In what role?--&gt;

===Water===

===Collectors===
For many ores (e.g. those of Cu, Mo, W, Ni), the collectors are anionic sulfur ligands.  Particularly popular are [[xanthate]] salts, including potassium amyl xanthate (PAX), potassium isobutyl xanthate (PIBX), [[potassium ethyl xanthate]] (KEX), [[sodium isobutyl xanthate]] (SIBX), [[sodium isopropyl xanthate]] (SIPX), [[sodium ethyl xanthate]] (SEX).  Other collectors include related sulfur-based ligands: [[dithiophosphate]]s, [[dithiocarbamate]]s.  Still other classes of collectors include the [[thiourea]] [[thiocarbanilide]].  [[Fatty acid]]s have also been used.

For some minerals (e.g., [[sylvanite]] for KCl), [[fatty amine]]s are used as collectors.

===Frothers===
A variety of compounds are added to stabilize the foams.  These additives include [[pine oil]], various [[alcohol]]s ([[4-Methyl-2-pentanol|methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC)]]), [[Polyethylene glycol|polyglycols]], [[xylenol]] (cresylic acid).

===Modifiers===
A variety of other compounds are added to optimize the separation process, these additives are called modifiers.  Such species do not interact directly with the mineral, but modify the physical properties of the solution.
* [[pH]] modifiers include [[Calcium oxide|lime]] (CaO), [[sodium carbonate|Soda ash]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Sodium hydroxide|Caustic soda]] (NaOH), [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[hydrochloric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, HCl).
&lt;!--seem improbable or specialized*[[Cation]]ic modifiers: Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;--&gt;
* [[Anion]]ic modifiers include phosphates, silicates, and carbonates.
* Organic modifiers include the thickeners [[dextrin]], [[starch]], [[glue]], and [[carboxymethyl cellulose|CMC]].

===Chemical compounds for deinking of recycled paper===
* pH control: [[sodium silicate]] and [[sodium hydroxide]]
* [[Calcium]] [[ion]] source: [[hard water]], [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] or [[calcium chloride]]
* Collector: [[fatty acid]], fatty acid [[emulsion]], fatty acid [[soap]] and/or organo-modified [[siloxane]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent | inventor-last = Nellesen | inventor-first = Bernhard | inventor2-last = Northfleet | inventor2-first = Christina | publication-date = 05.02.2004 | year = 2004 | title = METHOD OF DEINKING | country-code = WO | patent-number = 011717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific ore applications ==
Illustrative, the flotation process is used for purification of [[potassium chloride]] from [[sodium chloride]] and clay minerals.  The crushed mineral is suspended in brine in the presence of [[fatty amine|fatty ammonium]] salts.  Because the ammonium group and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; have very similar ionic radii (ca. 0.135, 0.143&amp;nbsp;nm respectively), the ammonium centers exchange for the surface potassium sites on the particles of KCl, but not on the NaCl particles.  The long [[alkyl]] chains then confer hydrophobicity, to the particles, which enable them to form foams.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Elizabeth R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7174">The '''German Banking Industry Committee''' ('''GBIC''') ({{lang-de|'''Die Deutsche Kreditwirtschaft'''}} / '''''DK'''''), previously known as the '''Central Credit Committee''' ({{lang-de|'''Zentraler Kreditausschuss'''}} / '''''ZKA''''') is an industry association of the German banking industry. Its decisions are held normative for the national banking sector – either directly by interbank treaties or indirectly by preparing a corresponding ministerial or [[Bundesbank]] decision.&lt;ref&gt;The German "Die Deutsche Kreditwirtschaft " is literally ''The German Services Sector'' / ''The German Banking Industry'' (the German word "-wirtschaft" is an abstract so the definite article "Die" / ''The'' needs to be part of the official title). As for English publications the hybrid term "German Banking Industry Committee" is used, even with its own abbreviation GBIC, see for example the 2012 update of the {{cite web|url=http://www.die-deutsche-kreditwirtschaft.de/uploads/media/conditions_of_use_v18_01122011_01.pdf |title=Interface Specifications for the ZKA Chip Card |publisher=Die Deutsche Kreditwirtschaft |date=2012-02-20 |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193108/http://www.die-deutsche-kreditwirtschaft.de/uploads/media/conditions_of_use_v18_01122011_01.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Until August 2011, the association was known as the '''Central Credit Committee'''&lt;ref&gt;"Central Credit Committee" is the official English name used in publications of the ZKA&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-de|'''Zentraler Kreditausschuss'''}} / '''''ZKA''''') when it adopted a new name (after almost eighty years).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.die-deutsche-kreditwirtschaft.de/dk/die-deutsche-kreditwirtschaft.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Structure ==
The Central Credit Committee was founded in 1932 as a common [[interest group]] of the five federal interest groups that represent the financial sector in Germany.

The five founding associations are:
* ''{{lang|de|[[Bundesverband der Deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken]]}}'' (Federal Association of German ''Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken'' Co-operative Banks – the credit unions)
* ''[[Bundesverband deutscher Banken]]'' (Federal Association of German Banks – the private banks)
* ''[[Bundesverband Öffentlicher Banken Deutschlands]]'' (Federal Association of Public Banks in Germany – the regional / state banks)
* ''[[Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband]]'' (German Association of Giro and Savings Banks)
* ''[[Verband deutscher Pfandbriefbanken]]'' (Association of German Bond Banks) 

By indirection of these associations the Central Credit Committee represents 2,300 financial institutions (2005). The committee itself is not an institution – it is neither registered, nor does it have a postal address. The committee presidency changes annually rotating among the associations for private banks, for savings banks and for co-operative banks.

The Central Credit Committee resolves "common statements" (decided unanimously) representing the view of the German banking industry on a topic. The statements are published thereby influencing decisions of other institutions like the [[Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Germany)|Federal Financial Supervisory Authority]], the Bundesbank or decision-making bodies of the [[European Union]]. Publication and press releases are the main task of the presiding association.

Additionally the Central Credit Committee supervises joint committees of the German banking industry like the Central Competition Committee (''Zentrale Wettbewerbsausschuss'') or the Working Group on Automatic Teller Machines.

== Standards in electronic banking ==
The Central Credit Committee has created the standards in electronic banking which are resolved by proposing agreements (''Abkommen'') that are joined by the banking institutions. Banking institutions that are members of one of the associations in the ZKA are naturally bound to join these.

* ''Abkommen über die Datenfernübertragung zwischen Kunden und Kreditinstitute'' (''[[DFÜ-Abkommen]]'' / [[Remote data transmission|RDT]] agreement - includes the [[EBICS]] protocol)
* ''Vereinbarung über den beleglosen Datenaustausch in der zwischenbetrieblichen Abwicklung des Inlandszahlungsverkehrs'' (''[[Clearingabkommen]]'' / [[clearing (finance)|clearing]] agreement)
* Vereinbarung über die Richtlinien für einheitliche Zahlungsverkehrsvordrucke (''payment blank form guidelines'')
* Homebanking-Abkommen (''[[online banking]] agreement'' – includes the [[HBCI]] protocol)
* Abkommen zum Überweisungsverkehr ([[wire transfer|direct credit transfer]] agreement)
* ''Abkommen über den Einzug von Schecks'' (''[[Scheckabkommen]]'' / [[cheque]] agreement)

== European Economic Area ==
The creation of the [[single market of the European Union]] (1993) and the introduction of the [[Eurozone]] (1999/2002) has made for a shift to make decisions on a European scale. As a consequence the [[European Committee for Banking Standards]] (ECBS) was founded in December 1992 and the [[European Payments Council]] (EPC) was created in summer 2002. These drive the development of the [[Single Euro Payments Area]] (SEPA) and the ZKA is supervising the EPC working groups by creating their own ZKA working groups mirroring the structure of the EPC.

Geicke studied Business Administration and Business Law at the [[University of Hamburg]] and moved to [[Hong Kong]] in 1981 to be a successful entrepreneur with export-oriented manufacturing companies in China.&lt;ref name="Handelsblatt"&gt;[https://global.handelsblatt.com/edition/56/ressort/companies-markets/article/aiming-high-in-ho-chi-minh-city "Aiming High in Ho Chi Minh City"], [[Handelsblatt]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he focused on investments, particularly in real estate along [[Richard Li]]. He also founded VinaCapital Investment Management, Euro Auto (BMW Vietnam), and the Pacific Alliance Group (PAG).&lt;ref name="FAZ"&gt;[http://horstgeicke.com/de/faz-wie-ein-deutscher-milliarden-in-asien-investiert/ "Wie ein Deutscher Milliarden in Asien investiert"], [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=20523238&amp;privcapId=250031777 "Executive Profile"], [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]&lt;/ref&gt; He is known as an early investor in China as well as in Vietnam and with this expertise mentioned in newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2010/03/30/vietnam-investment-property-emerging-markets-real-estate-jonathan-choi.html "Buy Vietnam"], [[Forbes]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/29/china-richest-billionaires-biz-chinarichest08-cx_rf_1029chinaintro.html "China's 400 Richest"], [[Forbes]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-8671046.html "China erwacht, die Welt erbebt"], [[Der Spiegel]] (German)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 he was ranked 270 of the richest Germans by [[Manager Magazin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://horstgeicke.com/de/manager-magazin-die-500-reichsten-deutschen/ "Die 500 reichsten Deutschen"], [[Manager Magazin]] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Geicke is primarily known as chairman and investor of the Deutsches Haus Ho Chi Minh City. The building complex which is scheduled to be completed by 2017 consists of two towers with an estimated investment of €100 million.&lt;ref name="Handelsblatt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vir.com.vn/deutsches-haus-a-lighthouse-for-german-vietnamese-partnership.html "Deutsches Haus - A lighthouse for German-Vietnamese partnership"], ''Vietnam Investment Review''&lt;/ref&gt; It was initiated under a bilateral government agreement between Germany and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/EN/Artikel/2014/10_en/2014-10-15-bkin-empfaengt-pm-vietnam_en.html;jsessionid=6DD63616723A720E97E7D7E547DFAA6F.s1t1 "Bringing the partnership to life"], ''Federal Government of Germany''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thanhniennews.com/business/germany-builds-a-home-in-ho-chi-minh-city-eyes-investment-opportunities-52932.html "Germany builds a home in Ho Chi Minh City, eyes investment opportunities"], ''thanhniennews.com''&lt;/ref&gt; This centrally located property had been purchased in 1960 by the German government. Geicke then acquired the property from the German federal government, which was originally intended for “diplomatic purposes” in Ho Chi Minh city against initial resistance of the Vietnamese party bureaucracy and by negotiating with the German federal ministries. Geicke had previously acquired federal property in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="FAZ" /&gt;

==History==
At its initial launch in 2004, Infosys Consulting focused on recruitment in the United States to launch programs in a [[Global delivery model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/430317/infosys-looks-local-talent-consulting|title= Infosys Looks to Local Talent for U.S. Consulting Business|publisher= Gartner|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/chris.trimble/osi/downloads/Infosys_Consulting_2-0022-11.2007.pdf|title= Case Study: Infosys Consulting|publisher= Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Infosys acquired [[Lodestone Management Consultants]], based out of Zurich, Switzerland for $350m USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbesindia.com/blog/technology/today-in-tech-lodestone-acquisition-tcs-infosys-labor-unions-in-it-firms-shibulal-on-strategy/ |publisher= Forbes|title= Today in Tech: Lodestone Acquisition - TCS, Infosys &amp; Cognizant; Labor Unions in IT firms; Shibulal on strategy|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lodestone increased the Infosys Consulting client base by nearly 200 companies across different industry segments, and at the time of acquisition, Infosys’ consulting and systems-integration business contributed to 31% of total revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/business/infosys-acquires-swiss-firm-lodestone-for-rs1925-crore/article3880535.ece|title= Infosys Acquires Swiss Firm Lodestone for rs.1925 Crore|publisher= The Hindu|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition brought on 850 new employees, with 750 being front-line consulting delivery professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/raywang/2012/09/10/news-analysis-infosys-buys-lodestone-for-350m/|title=News Analysis: Infosys Buys Lodestone for $350m|publisher= Forbes|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Infosys Ltd decided to  integrate Lodestone, at the time a subsidiary of Infosys, and the Management Consulting Services unit into the singular Infosys Consulting unit that resides within Infosys Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livemint.com/Companies/4LfVsa2ddSvjTaKYrLUPVI/Infosys-revamps-its-consulting-business.html|title=Infosys Revamps its Consulting Business|publisher= LiveMint|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbesindia.com/article/special/infosys-consolidates-consulting-business/39785/1|title= Infosys Consolidates Consulting Business|publisher= Forbes India|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liverpool's "commercial district" is a term given by business to distinguish Liverpool's business and commercial centre from the rest of the city centre.

It is centred on Old Hall Street and is the financial heart of Liverpool. Many businesses and companies have a strong presence in the area. Since the mid-2000s many new building and redevelopment projects have taken place in the commercial district, which is now home to some of the tallest buildings in [[North West England]]. Some notable properties within the commercial district include the [[Post &amp; Echo Building|headquarters of the Post &amp; Echo]] and offices of [[Unisys]], [[HM Passport Office]], [[BT Group|BT]] and [[A. P. Moller-Maersk Group|Maersk Line]]. With {{convert|36000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of floor space, [[New Hall Place]] is the largest office building in Liverpool, [[The Plaza, Liverpool|The Plaza]] is another large office building in the commercial district which is occupied by a number of different companies. The table below shows the tallest buildings within the commercial district (excluding buildings in neighbouring [[Prince's Dock, Liverpool|Prince's Dock]] or [[Pier Head]] – a more detailed list of the tallest buildings and structures in the remainder of Liverpool city centre can be [[List of tallest buildings and structures in Liverpool|seen here]]).

*Kings Dock
[[King's Dock, Port of Liverpool|Kings Dock]] has been vastly redeveloped over recent years, and the former dock has now been filled in. The 11,000 capacity [[Echo Arena Liverpool|Echo Arena]] is now sited on what was King's Dock as well as a number of new apartment buildings and hotels.

*Pier Head and Mann Island

[[Pier Head]] is one of Liverpool's most famous locations, it is home to the 'Three Graces' which have dominated the city's skyline for over a century (they are the [[Royal Liver Building]], the [[Cunard Building]] and the [[Port of Liverpool Building]]). The Three Graces are not the only buildings located at Pier Head, the [[Memorial to the Engine Room Heroes of the Titanic]] is also sited here alongside the Pier Head Ferry Terminal and [[Queensway Tunnel]] Ventilation Shaft. Pier Head is bordered to the north by [[Prince's Dock, Liverpool|Prince's Dock]] and to the south by [[Mann Island]]. Mann Island is another section of the Liverpool waterfront which has seen significant regeneration over recent years, the [[Museum of Liverpool]] and the [[Mann Island Buildings]] are both under-construction as of September 2010.

*Prince's Dock
The Prince's Dock is located to the north of the Pier Head and the Three Graces which is now the home of the [[Liverpool Cruise Terminal]] where turnaround cruises arrive and depart. The land surrounding Prince's Dock is the subject of major redevelopment and could be part of the very ambitious Liverpool Waters Scheme.

'''Manufacturing process management''' ('''MPM''') is a collection of technologies and methods used to define how products are to be manufactured. MPM differs from [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP/MRP]] which is used to plan the ordering of materials and other resources, set manufacturing schedules, and compile cost data.&lt;ref name="Machover 236"&gt;{{cite book| last = Machover| first = Carl| others = Beverly Beckert| title = The CAD/CAM Handbook| date = January 1996| publisher = McGraw-Hill Companies| isbn = 978-0-07-039375-2| page = 236| chapter = 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cornerstone of MPM is the central repository for the integration of all these tools and activities aids in the exploration of alternative [[production line]] scenarios; making [[assembly line]]s more efficient with the aim of reduced lead time to product launch, shorter product times and reduced [[work in progress]] (WIP) inventories as well as allowing rapid response to product or product changes.

'''Sir Matthew Decker, 1st Baronet''' (1679 – 18 March 1749) was an English [[merchant]], writer on trade and politician who sat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] from 1719 to 1722.

==Early life==
Decker was born in [[Amsterdam]], the son of Derick Decker of Amsterdam and his wife Katherina. He was educated in Amsterdam and went to London in 1702 and established himself there as a merchant.&lt;ref name=Burke&gt;{{cite book |url =  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DqkTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA155 | page=155|title= A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies of England, Ireland and Scotland |author= John Burke, Sir Bernard Burke, Bernard Burke |publisher = Scott, Webster, and Geary | date= 1841 |accessdate =  25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was remarkably successful in his business life, gaining great wealth and having many honours conferred upon him. He married Henrietta Watkins, daughter of  the Reverend  Richard Watkins D.D., rector of [[Whichford]], Warwickshire before 1711.&lt;ref name = HOP&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/member/decker-sir-matthew-1679-1749| title=DECKER, Sir Matthew, 1st Bt. (1679-1749), of Richmond, Surr. | publisher= History of Parliament Online| accessdate = 26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial and political career==
Decker was a  governor of the [[South Sea Company]] from 1711 to 1712, and became a Director of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] in 1713, remaining until 1743. He was created a [[baronet]], of London, by [[George I of England|George I]] in 1716. 

With the help of the [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos|Duke of Chandos]], Decker was returned unopposed as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Bishop's Castle (UK Parliament constituency)|Bishop's Castle]]  at a by-election on 17 December 1719. Chandos was a client of his for whom he bought paintings and tapestries in the Netherlands. In 1720 Decker was Assistant of the [[Royal African Company]] and became Deputy Governor of the East India Company to 1721. He told Chandos in 1721 that he had had enough of [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]], and did not stand in the [[British general election, 1722|1722 general election]].&lt;ref name=HOP/&gt;   

Decker was Governor of the East India Company from 1725 to 1726 and was its chairman in 1725. He was selected to be [[High Sheriff of Surrey]] in 1729. Also in 1729 he was Deputy Governor of the East India Company again, Governor from 1730 to 1733 and Chairman from 1730 to 1732.&lt;ref name=HOP/&gt; 
 
==Publications==
Decker's fame as a writer on trade rests on two tracts. The first, ''Serious considerations on the several high duties which the Nation in general, as well as Trade in particular, labours under, with a proposal for preventing the removal of goods, discharging the trader from any search, and raising all the Publick Supplies by one single Tax'' (1743; name affixed to 7th edition, 1756), proposed to do away with customs duties and substitute a tax upon houses. He also suggested taking the duty off tea and putting instead a licence duty on households wishing to consume it. The second, an ''Essay on the Causes of the Decline of the Foreign Trade, consequently of the value of the lands in Britain, and on the means to restore both'' (1744), has been attributed to [[W. Richardson]], but internal evidence is strongly in favor of Decker's authorship. He advocates the licence plan in an extended form; urges the repeal of import duties and the abolition of bounties, and, in general, shows himself such a strong supporter of the doctrine of [[free trade]] as to rank as one of the most important thinkers in the early development of economic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=41827152 | last = Nevin | first = Seamus |title=Richard Cantillon – The Father of Economics| journal = History Ireland | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 20–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Decker died on 18 March 1749. He originally had a son and three daughters,&lt;ref name=HOP/&gt; but only two daughters married:
*Catherine (died 1786), who married [[Richard FitzWilliam, 6th Viscount FitzWilliam]], and had issue&lt;ref&gt;22 George III cap. 59  "An Act for vesting in the Crown certain hereditaments at Richmond in the county of Surrey belonging to Catherine, Viscountess FitzWilliam...."&lt;/ref&gt;
*Henrietta Anne (died 1747),  who married [[John Talbot (judge)|John Talbot]], but had no issue.&lt;ref&gt;[[Burke's Peerage]] 1833  4th Edition Vol. 2 p,519&lt;/ref&gt;

He had no male heir and the baronetcy became extinct. His fortune and estates passed to his surviving daughter Catherine, and then to her son [[Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam]].

Typically an individual will document the events of the conversation as soon as possible after the occurrence.&lt;ref name=memcon /&gt; All material statements and discussed items are quoted and described as accurately as possible soon after the discussion and filed for future reference.&lt;ref name=memcon&gt;{{citation|first=Lawrence|last=O'Donnell|authorlink=Lawrence O'Donnell|work=[[The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell]]|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=May 16, 2017|title=MEMCON}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memcons function as documentation of historical events, such as conversations between heads of state and law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name=ford&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/guides/findingaid/Memoranda_of_Conversations.asp|title=Summary Description|work=National Security Adviser. Memoranda of Conversations, 1973-1977|publisher=[[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum]]|access-date=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific developments discussed, the time of the meeting, location, and individuals in attendance are all documented in-depth within the memo.&lt;ref name=memcon /&gt;&lt;ref name=memfile&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/a-brief-history-of-the-memo-to-the-file/article/2008086|first=Eric|last=Felten|title=A Brief History of the 'Memo to the File'|date=May 17, 2017|work=[[The Weekly Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Department of Justice]] attorneys and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] [[special agent]]s commonly make use of memoranda of conversation.&lt;ref name=memcon /&gt; A majority of intermediate-rank managerial staff and bureaucrats within the U.S. federal government consistently make use of the method. The creation of a memorandum of understanding allows federal employees to memorialize and keep a record of their conversations and transactions.&lt;ref name=memfile /&gt;

Memoranda to file are used in investigations in the private sector. For example, the [[fraud]] unit of a large corporation may use memoranda to file, to report individual interviews and significant telephone conversations. Generally, "the memorandum will show the name of the author, date of preparation, the case name or number, and the specific subject covered. It will also contain the detailed narrative of the event, interview, or other investigative activity described and should be written as close in time as circumstances permit to those events."&lt;ref name=sennewald&gt;{{citation|first1=Charles A.|last1= Sennewald|first2=John K.|last2= Tsukayama|title=The Process of Investigation: Concepts and Strategies for Investigators in the Private Sector|edition=4th|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]|year=2015|pages=189-90|isbn=978-0128001660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{wikisource|Memorandum of Conversation, by the Officer in Charge of Korean Affairs in the Office of Northeast Asian Affairs July 9, 1951}}
Former Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and subsequently Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, [[Brent Scowcroft]], who served as such in the U.S. presidential administration of [[Gerald R. Ford]], kept copious documentation of his meetings in the form of memorandum of conversation.&lt;ref name=ford /&gt; He would take handwritten notes, and immediately have them transcribed in typewritten format with the assistance of his staff from the [[United States National Security Council]].&lt;ref name=ford /&gt; The [[Gerald R.

'''Moriwaki Engineering''' is a Japanese manufacturer of speciality high performance products and [[motorcycle accessories]]. 

__TOC__
==Company founder==

'''Mamoru Moriwaki''' is a Japanese [[motorcycle]] tuner, race team owner and founder of Moriwaki Engineering, a Japanese specialty engineering company that designs, manufactures and sells high performance parts for [[motorcycle]]s and [[car]]s.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Company History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moriwaki.co.jp/global/about/01.html |title=Moriwaki Company History |publisher=moriwaki.co.jp |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His motorcycle industry career is closely intertwined with that of [[Pops Yoshimura]], another respected motorcycle tuner.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportrider.com/sportbikes/moriwaki-engineering-company-nature-s-tuning-shop |title=Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop |publisher=sportrider.com |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moriwaki began his career as a [[Motorcycle racing|motorcycle racer]] for [[Pops Yoshimura|Hideo "Pops" Yoshimura]], a respected motorcycle mechanic and tuner involved in Japanese motorcycle racing.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moriwaki dream to beat factory team"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crash.net/motogp/news/73157/1/moriwaki-dream-to-beat-factory-team |title=Moriwaki dream to beat factory team |publisher=crash.net |accessdate=13 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moriwaki received no formal training in engineering while working for Yoshimura. Instead, he became self-taught, learning about mechanical engineering from books borrowed from his local high school.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; Moriwaki married Namiko Yoshimura, Pops’ eldest daughter, while he was working for the company.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moriwaki dream to beat factory team"/&gt; While working for the Yoshimura racing team, Moriwaki also successfully competed in [[auto racing]], driving a Yoshimura-prepared [[Honda S800]] sports car to a class victory at the [[6 Hours of Fuji]] endurance race on July 26, 1970, and the GTS1 Class at the 1971 Japan Grand Prix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yoshimura-jp.com/en/fan/race/ |title=Yoshimura Racing History |publisher=yoshimura-jp.com |accessdate=13 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Yoshimura made the decision to move his company to the United States to take advantage of the burgeoning American motorcycle market.&lt;ref name="Pops Yoshimura at the Motorcycle Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.aspx?RacerID=297&amp;lpos=0px&amp;letter=Y&amp;txtFname=&amp;rblFname=S&amp;txtLname=&amp;rblLname=S&amp;discipline=0 |title=Pops Yoshimura at the Motorcycle Hall of Fame |publisher=motorcyclemuseum.org |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moriwaki did not agree with Yoshimura and refused to leave his home in Japan.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; This created a rift between the two men however, within a year Yoshimura had returned to Japan and sought Moriwaki for help after he had been cheated out of all his money in a business transaction in America.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; Moriwaki loaned Yoshimura money to re-establish himself.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; Yoshimura would go on to establish one of the premier manufacturers of motorcycle high performance parts in the United States and became closely associated with the [[Suzuki]] racing program.&lt;ref name="Pops Yoshimura at the Motorcycle Hall of Fame"/&gt;

Moriwaki remained in Japan and in 1973 he founded Moriwaki Engineering in [[Suzuka, Mie|Suzuka City]], Japan. He became known for modifying engines and constructing [[motorcycle frame|frames]] for the [[Kawasaki Z1]].&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; His bikes were successfully raced in the Australian [[Superbike racing|Superbike]] championships in the late 1970s by New Zealander [[Graeme Crosby]].&lt;ref name="Wayne Gardner's 1980 Moriwaki Kawasaki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ma.org.au/index.php?id=610 |title=Wayne Gardner's 1980 Moriwaki Kawasaki |publisher=ma.org.au |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby and co-rider Tony Hatton finished in third place at the prestigious [[Suzuka 8 Hours]] endurance race in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graemecrosby.com/history-the-early-days.php |title=Graeme Crosby - The Early Days |publisher=graemecrosby.com |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motoracing-japan.com/result/spl/788h.html |title=1978 Suzuka 8 Hours results |publisher=motoracing-japan.com |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moriwaki's reputation continued to be enhanced when Crosby and Akitaka Tomie qualified a Moriwaki Kawasaki on [[pole position]] at the 1979 Suzuka 8 Hours, ahead of all the major factory racing teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motoracing-japan.com/result/spl/798h.html#2 |title=1979 Suzuka 8 Hours qualifying results |publisher=motoracing-japan.com |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1980 Suzuka 8 Hours race, the Moriwaki team of [[Dave Aldana]] and David Emde qualified in a respectable second place ahead of the official Kawasaki [[factory-backed]] team of [[Eddie Lawson]] and [[Gregg Hansford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motoracing-japan.com/result/spl/808h.html#2 |title=1980 Suzuka 8 Hours qualifying results |publisher=motoracing-japan.com |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Crosby went on to race in the [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|world championships]], Moriwaki hired Australian rider [[Wayne Gardner]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; Also in 1981, Moriwaki developed the world’s first aluminum frame for large capacity motorcycles and entered them in competitions.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Company History"/&gt; Gardner and John Pace qualified their Moriwaki Kawasaki on pole position at the 1981 Suzuka 8 Hours, once again beating all the major factory racing teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motoracing-japan.com/result/spl/818h.html#2 |title=1981 Suzuka 8 Hours qualifying results |publisher=motoracing-japan.com |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world.honda.com/motorsports/2017/8hours/go_beyond/19/ |title=MORIWAKI’s Spirit Alive and Well After 9 Years Away |publisher=honda.com |accessdate=13 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner then rode the Moriwaki Kawasaki to an impressive fourth place finish at the 1981 Daytona Superbike race behind Yoshimura Suzuki riders Crosby, [[Wes Cooley (motorcyclist)|Wes Cooley]] and Honda's [[Freddie Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CWcbfdLZ5MC&amp;lpg=RA5-PA65&amp;dq=1981%20daytona%20200&amp;pg=RA5-PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=1981%20daytona%20200&amp;f=false |title=Yoshimura Dominates Superbike Production Again |author=Ulrich, John |publisher=Books.Google.com |year=1981 |work=Cycle World |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moriwaki and Gardner proceeded to compete in the British championship, winning their first race in England.&lt;ref name="Wayne Gardner's 1980 Moriwaki Kawasaki"/&gt; Gardner entered the final race of the season with a chance to win the title but, an engine misfire relegated him to third place overall in the championship.&lt;ref name="Wayne Gardner's 1980 Moriwaki Kawasaki"/&gt; Gardner's impressive results on the Moriwaki Kawasaki eventually earned him a contract with the [[Honda]] factory racing team and an eventual [[List of Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Champions by year|world championship]] in [[1987 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1987]].&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wayne Gardner's 1980 Moriwaki Kawasaki"/&gt;
[[File:Moriwaki Zero X-7.jpg|thumb|right|1984 Moriwaki Honda Zero X-7]]
In the 1980s, Moriwaki became closely associated with [[Honda Racing Corporation]], the racing division for the Honda parent company.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; Moriwaki was the first outside firm allowed to use one of Honda's racing engines.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; From [[2003 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2003]] to [[2005 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2005]], Moriwaki competed in the premier [[MotoGP]] class with a [[Honda RC211V]] engine in a Moriwaki designed frame.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki dream to beat factory team"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moriwaki.co.jp/global/racing/md211vf.html |title=Moriwaki MotoGP Project |publisher=moriwaki.co |accessdate=13 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm gained valuable knowledge from this experience and in [[2010 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2010]], a Moriwaki-framed machine run by [[Gresini Racing]] took the inaugural [[Moto2]] title with rider [[Toni Elias]].&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motorcyclenews.com/sport/motogp/2009/april/apr2409-moriwaki-unveils-moto2-bike-/ Moriwaki unveil latest Moto2 contender]

[[File:British Virgin Islands Companies Registry (2).jpg|thumb|The British Virgin Islands Companies Registry.]]
The term '''"offshore company'''" or '''"offshore corporation'''" is used in at least two distinct and different ways.  An offshore company may be a reference to:
* a company, [[Corporate group|group]] or sometimes a division thereof, which engages in '''[[offshoring]] business processes'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/offshore.asp|title=Definition: offshore|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International business company|International business companies]] (IBC) or other types of [[Legal personality|legal entities]], which are incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction, that prohibits local economic activities.&lt;ref&gt;T.J. van Koningsveld, 2016. De Offshore Wereld Ontmaskerd. Kerckebosch.&lt;/ref&gt;

The former use (companies formed in offshore jurisdictions) is probably the more common usage of the term. In isolated instances the term can also be used in reference to companies with [[Offshore drilling|offshore oil and gas]] operations.

==Companies from offshore jurisdictions==
{{see also|Conduit and Sink OFCs}}
In relation to companies and similar entities which are incorporated in offshore jurisdictions, the use of both the words "offshore" and "company" can be varied in application.

The extent to which a jurisdiction is regarded as offshore is often a question of perception and degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Identifying_Tax_Havens_Jul_07.pdf|title=Identifying tax havens and offshore financial centres|publisher=[[Tax Justice Network]]|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Classic tax haven countries such as [[Bermuda]], [[British Virgin Islands]] and the [[Cayman Islands]] are quintessentially offshore jurisdictions, and companies incorporated in those jurisdictions are invariably labelled as offshore companies.  Thereafter there are certain small intermediate countries or areas such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]] (sometimes referred to as "mid-shore" jurisdictions) which, whilst having oversized financial centres, are not zero tax regimes.  Finally, there are classes of industrialised economies which can be used as part of tax mitigation structures, including countries like [[Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]] and even the [[United Kingdom]], particularly in commentary relating to [[corporate inversion]].  Furthermore, in Federal systems, states which operate like a classic offshore centre can result in corporations formed there being labelled as offshore, even if they form part of the largest economy in the world (for example, [[Delaware]] in the [[United States]]).

Similarly, the term "company" is used loosely, and at its widest can be taken to refer to any type of artificial entity, including not just corporations and [[company|companies]], but potentially also [[Limited liability company|LLCs]], [[Limited partnership|LPs]], [[Limited liability partnership|LLPs]], and sometimes [[partnership]]s or even [[offshore trust]]s.

===Classifying offshore companies===

Historically, offshore companies were broadly divided into two categories.  On the one hand were companies which were statutorily exempt from taxation in their jurisdiction of registration provided that they did not undertake business with persons resident in that jurisdiction.  Such companies were usually called [[International business company|International Business Companies]], or IBCs.  Such companies were largely popularized by the [[British Virgin Islands]], but the model was copied widely.  However, in the early 2000s the [[OECD]] launched a global initiative to prevent "ring fencing" of taxation in this manner, and many leading jurisdictions (including the British Virgin Islands and [[Gibraltar]]) repealed their [[International Business Companies Act|International Business Companies legislation]].  But IBCs are still incorporated in a number of jurisdictions today including [[Anguilla]] and [[Panama]].

Separately from IBCs, there are countries which operate tax regimes which broadly achieve the same effect: so long as the company's activities are carried on overseas, and none of the profits are repatriated, the company is not subject to taxation in its home jurisdiction.  Where the home jurisdiction is regarded as an offshore jurisdiction, such companies are commonly regarded as offshore companies.  Examples of this include [[Hong Kong]] and [[Uruguay]].  However, these tax regimes are not limited to conventional offshore jurisdictions: the [[United Kingdom]] operates on broadly similar principles in relation to taxation of companies.

Separately there are offshore jurisdictions which simply do not impose any form of taxation on companies, and so their companies are de facto tax exempt.  Historically the best example of these countries were the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Bermuda]],&lt;ref&gt;Bermuda does, however, impose payroll tax on employees who actually work in Bermuda.&lt;/ref&gt; although other countries such as the [[British Virgin Islands]]&lt;ref name="Power Players"&gt;{{cite web |title=What are the most popular offshore jurisdictions? |url= https://www.oilglobal.com/AOC/Q4 |publisher=[[OIL (incorporations and corporate services)]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; have now moved to this model.  These could arguably fit into either of the previous two categories, depending on the fiscal point of view involved.

To the Offshore Company definition, applies five (non-cumulative) limiting conditions:
(1) The government in the country of incorporation does not levy an indirect tax on the OAC (however, the OSC must pay an annual fee to the government).
(2) Separate laws and regulations apply.
(3) The OSC doesn’t have its own physical office (address), personnel, means of communication etc. This means that the OAC must have a representative (registered agent) and office address (registered office) in the county of the incorporation.
(4) The OSC must be managed and governed by (an employee of) a local trust or law office.
(5) There is an instance of elements that benefit anonymity such as bearer shares and no or limited filing obligations.&lt;ref&gt;T.J van Koningsveld, 2016. De Offshore Wereld Ontmaskerd. Kerckebosch.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics of offshore companies===
[[File:Chart of an offshore company structure.jpg|thumb|Chart of an offshore company structure]]

Although all offshore companies differ to a degree depending upon the corporate law in the relevant jurisdiction, all offshore companies tend to enjoy certain core characteristics:
* They are broadly not subject to taxation in their home jurisdiction.
* The corporate regime will be designed to promote business flexibility.
* Regulation of corporate activities will normally be lighter than in a developed country.&lt;ref&gt;Classic offshore jurisdictions are very fond of the phrase "light touch" regulation, although in practice many offshore centres are witnessing increasingly invasive regulation.  This is probably reflective of the global trend towards greater regulation of the financial system rather than a change within the offshore financial world in particular.&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of taxation or regulation in the home jurisdiction does not, of course, exempt the relevant company from taxation or regulation abroad.  For example, [[Michael Kors Holdings Limited]] is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, but is listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], where it is subject both the U.S. taxation and to [[financial regulation]] by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]].

Another common characteristic of offshore companies is the limited amount of information available to the public.  This varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  At one end of the scale, in the Cayman Islands and Delaware, there is virtually no publicly available information.  But at the other end of the scale, in Hong Kong companies file annual returns with particulars of directors, shareholders and annual accounts.  However, even in jurisdictions where there is relatively little information available to the public as of right, most jurisdictions have laws which permit law enforcement authorities (either locally or from overseas) to have access to relevant information,&lt;ref&gt;See for example, in the British Virgin Islands, the Mutual Legal Assistance (United States of America) Act, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases, private individuals.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Anton Piller order]]s, which are available in most common law offshore jurisdictions.&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to flexible [[corporate law]], most offshore jurisdictions will normally remove corporate fetters such as [[thin capitalisation]] rules, [[financial assistance (share purchase)|financial assistance]] rules, and limitations on [[Corporate law#Capacity and powers|corporate capacity]] and [[corporate benefit]].  A number have also removed or watered down rules relating to maintenance of capital or restrictions on payment of [[dividend]]s.  Beyond the common themes, a number of jurisdictions have also enacted special corporate provisions to try and attract business through offering corporate mechanisms that allow complex business transactions or reorganisations to occur more smoothly.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [[British Virgin Islands company law#Reorganisation and restructuring|British Virgin Islands company law - Reorganisation and restructuring]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses of offshore companies===

Offshore companies are used [[Offshore financial centre#Offshore financial structures|for a variety of commercial and private purposes]], some legitimate and economically beneficial, whilst others may be harmful or even criminal.  Allegations are frequently made in the press about offshore companies being used for [[money laundering]], [[tax evasion]], [[fraud]], and other forms of [[white collar crime]].  Offshore companies are also used in a wide variety of commercial transactions from generic holding companies, to joint ventures and listing vehicles.  Offshore companies are also used widely in connection with private wealth for tax mitigation and privacy.  The use of offshore companies, particularly in [[tax planning]], has become controversial in recent years, and a number of high-profile companies have ceased using offshore entities in their group structure as a result of public campaigns for such companies to pay their "fair share" of Government taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e9fc449c-c2f0-11e2-bbbd-00144feab7de.html#axzz3CVr4cEjB|title=How we can make global companies pay their fair share of tax|publisher=''[[Financial Times]]''|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed information in relation to the use of offshore companies is notoriously difficult to come by because of the opaque nature of much of the business (and because, in many cases, the companies are used specifically to preserve the confidentiality of a transaction or individual).  It is a commonly held view that most uses of offshore companies are driven by tax mitigation and/or [[Arbitrage#Regulatory arbitrage|regulatory arbitrage]], although there are some suggestions that the amount of tax structuring may be less than commonly thought.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Offshore 2020]]'', a publication of market research published by [[Offshore Incorporations Limited Group|Offshore Incorporations Limited]], a leading offshore fiduciary services provider, recent surveys of industry practitioners suggest that the proportion of their work which is tax driven structuring is decreasing: from 15.9% in 2012 ({{cite news|title=Smoke, Mirrors and Offshore Regulation|url=http://www.chinaoffshore.com.hk/smoke-mirrors-and-offshore-regulation.html|accessdate=9 July 2014|newspaper=China Offshore|date=3 April 2013}}) to 10.3% in 2013 ({{cite news|title=Offshore 2020. Perception and Reality: Forces driving the offshore industry Report|url=http://www.economic-s.ru/index.php/author-articles/finances/offshore-2020-perception-and-reality-forces-driving-the-offshore-industry-report|accessdate=9 July 2014|newspaper=Economic-s|date=28 November 2013}}).  These figures need to be treated with caution as these are marketing reports, not systematic analyses.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other commonly cited legitimate uses of offshore companies include uses as [[joint ventures]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Anglo-Russian oil joint venture, [[TNK-BP]], was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands as a neutral third jurisdiction.&lt;/ref&gt; financing [[special purpose company|SPVs]], stock market listing vehicles, holding companies and asset holding structures, and trading vehicles.

Intermediate uses of offshore companies (i.e. uses which might be considered legitimate or illegitimate depending upon a particular person's view of legitimacy of [[globalisation]] and tax planning) include uses as [[offshore fund|investment funds]] and [[offshore trust|private wealth holding vehicles]].

==Offshoring as a business process==
{{Main|Offshoring}}
The alternative use of the phrase offshore company, being a business or part of a business which uses offshoring as part of its [[business process]], is less common, and is often used as a lazy shorthand way of saying that the relevant business engages in offshoring.

''Outsourced'' is set in a [[call center]] in [[Mumbai]], India, where an American [[novelties]] company has recently [[outsourcing|outsourced]] its order processing. A lone American manages the call center and must explain American popular culture to his employees as he tries to understand Indian culture.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
* [[Ben Rappaport]] as Todd Dempsy, a [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] native who is transferred to India to run the call center for Mid American Novelties. He does not understand Indian culture and is constantly offending workers unintentionally. He eventually becomes more aware of Indian culture. He is currently employed as executive manager.
* [[Rizwan Manji]] as Rajiv Gidwani, Todd's assistant manager at Mid American Novelties. He is hard-nosed and unapologetic and he aspires to be Todd's replacement (whether due to Todd's success or his downfall). When Todd is promoted to executive manager, Rajiv is promoted to manager. His intentions are not to be mean, but to only run the company professionally and business-like. It has long been his  dream to become a successful business manager so he can gain the approval of the wealthy father of Vimi, whom he has loved since childhood and wishes to marry. Once he becomes manager, he marries Vimi.
* [[Sacha Dhawan]] as Manmeet, a call center employee for Mid American Novelties, who dreams of America and quickly becomes good friends with his boss, Todd Dempsy. He is known for being the "hip" one, who is fascinated by American culture. Manmeet is girl-crazy; he has had several "over the phone" relationships with American callers and flirts with almost every woman he meets. He seems more interested in American women than Indian women, stating in one episode that American women are not concerned with his father's occupation or where he went to school. This, along with his reluctance to ask one of Tonya's friends to dance at a Halloween party, indicates that Manmeet may actually have a bit of an inferiority complex.
* [[Rebecca Hazlewood]] as Asha, a call center employee for Mid American Novelties and eventual love interest of Todd. She is frequently the voice of reason in the office and plans to pursue an arranged marriage. Early in the series, Todd develops feelings for Asha, who, while responding in some ways, eventually re-asserts her commitment to the arranged marriage process, leading Todd to develop a relationship with Tonya. In the penultimate episode, Tonya breaks up with Todd because he still has feelings for Asha. In the last scene of the finale, Asha, having earlier expressed doubts about her fiancée, tells Todd he should fight for what he wants, and takes his hand as they gaze at the celebratory crowd at Rajiv and Vimi's wedding, strongly implying that she wants him to fight for her because of her feelings for him as well.
* [[Parvesh Cheena]] as Gupta, a very talkative call center employee for Mid American Novelties, who constantly yearns to be the center of attention. After Todd inspires him to grab some independence from his parents, Gupta rents his own place in the apartment directly above Todd's.
* [[Anisha Nagarajan]] as Madhuri, a shy and soft-spoken call center employee for Mid American Novelties whose income  supports her entire family. As time passes, Madhuri opens up, becoming one of the office gossips. Madhuri also has a beautiful singing voice, and the others convince her to enter a singing contest.
* [[Diedrich Bader]] as American Charlie Davies, a call center manager for the company All-American Hunter. Charlie is  friendly and has good intentions but is somewhat socially clueless and a bit gruff, leading to many humorous situations. For several episodes, Charlie nurses a crush on Tonya, convinced he has a chance at a relationship despite her obvious disinterest in him romantically.
* [[Pippa Black]] as Tonya, an Australian call center manager for the company Koala Airlines who is easygoing and flirtatious with a sense of adventure; by mid-season, she and Todd are romantically involved  and remain so until just before the end of the series.

===Main recurring principal characters===

* [[Guru Singh]] as Ajeet, a tall, silent [[Sikh]] whose character frequently shows displeasure at Todd's cultural gaffes. A poet, he first speaks in the season finale, where he becomes Madhuri's love interest and his character is given a more prominent role.
* [[Thushari Jayasekera]] as Pinky, a fun and hardworking call center worker at Mid America Novelties, who is adventure seeking and ready to learn. Does funny and awkward things. Ready to defend her fellow call center team as well as party with the big boss. Played largest role in the season finale.

===Recurring characters===
* A-Team, a group of well-dressed executive employees for a computer support call center located in the same building. The group are conspicuously rude, snobby, and taunting.
* Jerry Stern (played by [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]]), Todd's [[supervisor]] in the U.S.; he is business focused and often reminds Todd of tough choices Todd is reluctant to make, such as firing a staff member due to poor sales. 
*Santosh, the maid at Todd's apartment.
*Vimi, (played by [[Sarayu Rao]] in the Jolly Vindaloo Day episoded and [[Noureen DeWulf]] in later episodes), Rajiv's fiancée and eventual wife.

He confronts Manmeet, who uses his flirtatiousness to sell more novelties and increasing revenue, so no one needs to be laid off.

'''Paul Arden''' (7 April 1940 – 2 April 2008) was a [[creative director]] of [[Saatchi and Saatchi]]  and an author of several books on [[advertising]] and [[motivation]], including ''Whatever You Think, Think The Opposite'' and ''It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want To Be''.

==Career==
In 1987 Arden was appointed Executive Creative Director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi after having spent 14 years with the agency, handling the accounts of [[British Airways]], [[Anchor Butter]], [[Toyota]], [[Ryvita]], [[Nivea]], [[Trust House Forte]], [[Alexon Group]] and [[Fujifilm|Fuji]] among others. His [[British Airways]] ads continue to be remembered as one of their greatest ever advertising campaigns, changing the fortunes of the airline.

"Arden was the ringmaster behind the whole creative circus that saw [[British Airways]] become 'The World's Favourite Airline', [[The Independent]] become the new intelligentsia's favourite newspaper, [[Margaret Thatcher]] the nation's favourite leader and [[Silk Cut]] their favourite fag."&lt;ref&gt;Dave Trott, [[The Independent]] [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tribute-a-legend-who-was-never-dull-ordinary-or-safe-805344.html Tribute: A legend who was never dull, ordinary or safe]  &lt;/ref&gt; 

"Tempestuous advertising director who thought up memorable campaigns for [[Silk Cut]], [[British Airways|BA]] and [[The Independent]]" [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3722393.ece Times Online]

Arden chose to leave [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] in 1992 but remained a key consultant for the agency until 1995.

After leaving Saatchi's, Arden set up, with his daughter-in-law and her brother, the company called Arden, Sutherland-Dodd, beginning a new career as a Director of commercials. He also contributed a regular column to [[The Independent]]. 

Arden always had a strong interest in [[photography]] and in 2003, together with his wife Toni, set up a gallery - Arden &amp; Anstruther - in [[Petworth]], near their home in [[West Sussex]].

* ''It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want To Be'' 2003 
* ''Whatever You Think, Think The Opposite'' 2006 
* ''God Explained in a Taxi Ride'' 2007 

==Death==
Paul Arden died on April 2, 2008, at 67 years old, after suffering a [[heart attack]].

==Quotes==
* We are all advertising, all of the time. Even the priest, with all his or her fervour, is advertising [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;telegraph.co.uk [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1583960/Paul-Arden.html Paul Arden] 05 Apr 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''performance supervision system''' ('''PSS''') is a [[software system]] used to improve the performance of a [[Industrial process|process]] [[Factory|plant]].  Typical process plants include [[oil refineries]], [[paper mills]], and [[chemical plant]]s.

The PSS gathers real-time data from the [[process control]] system, typically a [[distributed control system]].  Using this data, the PSS can calculate performance [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] for process equipment, controls, and operations.

The '''Rubber Plantation Certification Scheme''' is a scheme run by the [[Rubber Board]], a statutory body under the [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (India)|Ministry of Commerce and Industry]], a ministry of the Government of India, for granting certificates to the owners of [[rubber plantations]] showing all details of the rubber plantation. Certification of rubber plantations is a voluntary certification procedure launched by The Rubber Board in 2014.

==Background==

As per the section 10 of the Rubber Act, 1947 registration of rubber plantations was mandatory. However the Board discontinued the practice of registration in 1986 though the act was amended to that effect only by the Rubber Amendment Act 2009. With the discontinuation of mandatory pegistration, the Board resorted to structured statistical [[random sampling]] for collection of data on production, productivity, mature and immature areas, [[Cloning#Horticultural|clones]] planted and other factors. The accuracy of data collected through random sampling has been challenged by farmers and consumers of rubber; as a result, they demanded the reintroduction of registration. The Board resolved to approach the government for reintroduction of mandatory registration. Meanwhile, optional certification of rubber plantations was launched in 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11565">A '''retention of title clause''' (also called a '''''Romalpa'' clause''' in some jurisdictions) is a provision in a contract for the sale of goods that the title to the goods remains vested in the seller until certain obligations (usually payment of the purchase price) are fulfilled by the buyer.

==Purpose==

The main purpose of retention of title ("ROT") clauses is to ensure that where goods are supplied on credit, if the buyer subsequently goes into [[bankruptcy]], the seller can repossess the goods. They are often seen as a natural extension of the credit economy; where suppliers are expected to sell goods on credit, there is a reasonable expectation that if they are not paid they should be able to repossess the goods.  Nonetheless, in a number of jurisdictions, insolvency regimes or credit arrangement regimes prevent title retention clauses from being enforced where doing so would upset administration of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], where an [[Administration (insolvency)|administration order]] is made with respect to a company, section 11 of the ''[[Insolvency Act 1986]]'' prevents goods being repossessed without the leave of the court.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retention of title clauses are mandated in the [[European Union]] by Article 9 of the [[Late Payments Directive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EU directive |serial= 2011/7/EU|year= |date= 16 February 2011|description = on combating late payment in commercial transactions (recast)|eurlextag= OJ:L:2011:048:0001:0010:EN:PDF}}, replacing Article 4 of {{cite EU directive |serial= 2000/35/EC|year= |date= 29 June 2000|description = on combating late payment in commercial transactions|eurlextag= OJ:L:2000:200:0035:0038:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sellers' ROT rights are recognized by Article 7 of the [[Insolvency Regulation (EC) 1346/2000|Insolvency Regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EU regulation| serial= 1346/2000| date= 29 May 2000| description = on insolvency proceedings| eurlextag= OJ:L:2000:160:0001:0018:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially prevalent in [[Germany]],{{sfn|Davies|2006|pp=13{{endash}}15}} these clauses are permitted in the United Kingdom by s.19 of the ''[[Sale of Goods Act 1979]]'', which expanded upon the 1976 judgment of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] in ''[[Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1976] 1 WLR 676&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to English law,{{sfn|Bridge|Macdonald|Simmonds|Walsh|1999|p=633}} the common-law jurisdictions in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United States]] have instituted the concept of "[[security interest]]", under which ROT clauses may need to be registered in order to have effect:{{sfn|Duggan|2011|p=654}}

:* in the United States, states have adopted [[Secured transactions in the United States|Article 9]] of the ''[[Uniform Commercial Code]]'', which limits the clause's effectiveness{{sfn|Davies|2006|pp=15{{endash}}18}}
:* common-law provinces in Canada have adopted their ''[[Personal Property Security Act (Canada)|Personal Property Security Acts]]'' which operate similarly
:* in [[Quebec]], there is no "presumption of [[hypothec]]", and therefore an ROT clause is not considered to be a [[security interest]]; art. 1497 of the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]'' provides that "An obligation is conditional where it is made to depend upon a future and uncertain event,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|1497}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives legal authority to such clauses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Peter J. Cullen|chapter = Canada|editor= Alexander von Ziegler|year= 2011|title= Transfer of Ownership in International Trade|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H5m9VatRGkkC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;ots=VCZ3hQQezh&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;f=false|page = 73|location= The Netherlands|publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Kluwer Law International BV]]|isbn= 978-90-411-3134-8|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Australia and New Zealand have also adopted their own versions of the ''[[Personal Property Securities Register|Personal Property Security Act]]''

==Legal analysis==
Although title retention clauses are conceptually very simple, they have become increasingly widely drafted, which has resulted in the courts in a number of countries striking down the clauses, or recharacterising them as the grant of a [[security interest]]. It has consequentially been noted that "the practical outcome of a series of later cases has put it beyond doubt that 'extended' title reservation clauses will not work."{{sfn|Bridge|Macdonald|Simmonds|Walsh|1999|p=639}}  Several particular problems have been identified:

:* If for example, the clause reserves only part of the title to the seller (instead of reserving title to the whole thing) then in many jurisdictions this is [[recharacterisation|recharacterised]] as an [[Security interest#Equitable charge|equitable charge]], and is often void if certain registration requirements are not complied with.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in England in ''Re Bond Worth Ltd'' [1980] Ch 228 such a clause was held to be void as it had not been registered within 21 days as required by section 395 of the [[Companies Act 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Problems can also arise where the goods sold are mixed with other goods of a similar nature, so that they are no longer identifiable (e.g. a quantity of oil, or grain).&lt;ref&gt;In most common law jurisdictions, so long as the clause prohibited mixing in this manner, the rule is that the buyer and the seller jointly own the whole mixture as [[Concurrent estate#Tenancy in common|tenants in common]], see ''[[Indian Oil v. Greenstone Shipping]]'' [1987] 3 WLR 869&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Many jurisdictions allow the buyer to re-sell the goods before title has passed to him (often this is the only way that he can pay the seller).  In many jurisdictions such an onward sale passes good title to the subsequent purchaser, and the original seller loses title despite the clause&lt;ref&gt;For example, in England this is the effect of section 25(1) of the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]], and section 2(1) of the Factors Act 1889&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Where the seller tries to have a clause which provides that, if the buyer re-sells the goods, then the proceeds of sale of the goods shall be held on [[trust (law)|trust]] for the seller, this can be recharacterised as a registrable charge, which may also be void for non-registration.&lt;ref&gt;In England, see ''[[E Pfeiffer v. Arbuthnot Factors]]'' [1988] 1 WLR 150, although a differently worded clause was distinguished and upheld in ''[[Compaq Computer v. Abercorn]]'' [1991] BCC 484&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Another frequently litigated problem occurs where the goods which are subject to the clause are then either improved (e.g. raw thread is worked into cloth) or mixed with other raw materials to form a new product (e.g. silica is used to make glass).&lt;ref&gt;Generally speaking, in England, the law has been consistently applied that if the retention of title clause purports to apply to the new substance which has been made, then it takes effect as a charge and would be void if not registered, see for example, ''[[Re Peachdart]]'' [1984] Ch 131&lt;/ref&gt;
:* In some countries, where a clause purports to retain title until, not only the purchase price, but also any other debts of the buyer to the seller are paid in full, such clauses have been struck down for non-compliance with security registration requirements in those jurisdictions.

==Sample clauses==
Retention of title clauses will obviously vary from country to country, and even within countries they will usually be specialised to the form of industry used in, and the type of goods which are sold.  The following are just two examples of the types of clause which can be seen.

''A shorter form clause:''
:#Title to {''the Goods''} shall remain vested in {''the Seller''} and shall not pass to {''the Buyer''} until the purchase price for {''the Goods''} has been paid in full and received by {''the Seller''}.

''A longer form clause:''

:#Title to {''the Goods''} shall remain vested in {''the Seller''} and shall not pass to {''the Buyer''} until the purchase price for {''the Goods''} has been paid in full and received by {''the Seller''}.  Until title to {''the Goods''} passes:
:##{''the Seller''} shall have authority to retake, sell or otherwise deal with and/or dispose of all or any part of {''the Goods''};
:##{''the Seller''} and its agents and employees shall be entitled at any time and without the need to give notice enter upon any property upon which {''the Goods''} or any part are stored, or upon which {''the Seller''} reasonably believes them to be kept; 
:##{''the Buyer''} shall store or mark {''the Goods''} in a manner reasonably satisfactory to {''the Seller''} indicating that title to {''the Goods''} remains vested in {''the Seller''}; and
:##{''the Buyer''} shall insure {''the Goods''} to their full replacement value, and arrange for {''the Seller''} to be noted on the policy of insurance as the loss payee.
:#Irrespective of whether title to {''the Goods''} remains vested in {''the Seller''}, risk in {''the Goods''} shall pass to {''the Buyer''} upon delivery.

==Case list==
*''[[Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd]]'' [1976] 1 WLR 676
*''[[Re Peachdart Ltd]]'' [1984] Ch 131, if the clause applies to something not yet made, then it is a charge and must be registered to be effective.
*''[[Clough Mill Ltd v Martin]]'' [1984] 3 All ER 982, explaining how a simple clause operates.
*''[[Indian Oil v Greenstone Shipping]]'' [1987] 3 WLR 869
*''[[E Pfeiffer v Arbuthnot Factors]]'' [1988] 1 WLR 150
*''[[Compaq Computer v Abercorn]]'' [1991] BCC 484

== Entrepreneurship ==
=== Viaden Media ===

At the age of 16 Prokopenya took on the responsibility of caring for his family, when his father,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had started a business in the 1990s, died in a car accident. In the 2000s, Prokopenya focused on IT consulting and running [[Viaden Media]], the IT company that he founded. In 2006, he reoriented Viaden to develop their own IT products.&lt;ref name=lifetime.ubr /&gt;&lt;ref name=childhood /&gt;

In 2009 the company launched a mobile applications department, headed by [[Yuri Gurski]]. The company developed numerous top-rated applications including ''All-in Fitness'', which sustained top ranking positions on the [[AppStore]] Healthcare &amp; Fitness category in 40 countries for several months. Viaden achieved in excess of 200 million mobile application installations. By 2011 the company was the largest mobile phone software developer in the post-Soviet region. Prokopenya ran the company until 2011 when he sold it, for €95 million, to [[Teddy Sagi]], an Israeli entrepreneur and founder of [[Playtech]] software company. Later Viaden Media was divided into two companies: Sport.com (the largest developer of fitness applications, and owner of sites sport.com and yoga.com) and the Skywind Group (which specialises in mobile and social games).&lt;ref name=gursky.ej&gt;{{cite web

=== VP Capital ===

In 2012, Prokopenya founded his investment company, VP Capital, which has a focus on the technology sector. Later this year he started the fintech company exp(capital), which develops solutions for banks and brokers in order to construct algorithms for high frequency market making. The company is located in the [[Belarus High Technologies Park]], and was ranked the best employer of the year in 2014. The mobile applications department of exp(capital) was acquired by the British company [[IG Group|IG Holdings]] for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref name=exp.tut&gt;{{cite web

Critics argued that these calculations are inaccurate and that there is no connection between abolishing the death penalty in Belarus and reducing the country's debt burden. Some critics agreed that a moratorium on the death penalty will improve relations between Belarus and the European Union, and that this could affect the rating of the Belarusian Eurobonds and possibly rendering new debt cheaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
