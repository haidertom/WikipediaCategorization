      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">'''Accident-proneness''', also known as '''clumsiness''', is the idea that some people have a greater predisposition than others to suffer [[accident]]s, such as [[car crash]]es and [[industrial injuries]]. It may be used as a reason to deny any [[insurance]] on such individuals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insurancecompanies.com/insider-information-how-insurance-companies-measure-risk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==

The early work on this subject dates back to 1919, in a study by Greenwood and Woods, who studied workers at a British munitions factory and found that accidents were unevenly distributed among workers, with a relatively small proportion of workers accounting for most of the accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, M. and Woods, H.M. (1919) The incidence of industrial accidents upon individuals with special reference to multiple accidents. ''Industrial Fatigue Research Board, Medical Research Committee'', Report No. 4. Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
Further work on accident-proneness was carried out in the 1930s and 1940s.

== Present study ==

The subject is still being studied actively.  Research into accident-proneness is of great interest in [[safety engineering]], where human factors such as pilot error, or errors by nuclear plant operators, can have massive effects on the reliability and safety of a system.
One of the areas of most interest and more profound research is the Aeronautical area, where accidents have been reviewed from psychological and human factors, to mechanical and technical failures. There has been many conclusive studies, that present that human factor has great influence on the results of those occurrences.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Statistical evidence ===

Statistical evidence clearly demonstrates that different individuals can have different rates of accidents from one another; for example, young male drivers are the group at highest risk for being involved in car accidents. There also seems to be substantial variation in personal accident rates between individuals.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Doubt ===

However, a number of studies have cast doubt on whether accident-proneness actually exists as a ''distinct, persistent and independently verifiable'' physiological or psychological syndrome. Although substantial research has been devoted to this subject, there still seems to be no conclusive evidence either for or against the existence of accident proneness in this sense.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Nature and causes ===

The exact nature and causes of accident-proneness, assuming that it exists as a distinct entity, are unknown.  Factors which have been considered as associated with accident-proneness have included [[absent-mindedness]], [[wikt:clumsiness|clumsiness]], [[carelessness]], [[impulsivity]], predisposition to [[risk]]-taking, and unconscious desires to create accidents as a way of achieving secondary gains.
Broad studies on the speed and accuracy using a specially designed test sheet of finding a specific figure on various people as Japanese, Brazil born Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Filipinos, Thai and Central Americans with different educational backgrounds. The studies have revealed that educational background or study experience is the key factor of concentration capability. Screening new employees using this test gave drastic decrease of work accidents in several companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc |title=創造性ﾃｽﾄ、薬不要の風邪治療(妊婦､ｱｽﾘｰﾄ､NSAID)、適性ﾃｽﾄ |publisher=F6.dion.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923000135/http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc/ |archivedate=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baited remote underwater video''' (BRUV) is a system used in [[marine biology]] research. By attracting fish into the field of view of a remotely controlled camera, the technique records [[fish diversity]], [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] and [[Ethology|behaviour]] of species. Sites are sampled by video recording the region surrounding a baited canister which is lowered to the bottom from a surface vessel or less commonly by a [[submersible]] or [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]. The video can be transmitted directly to the surface by cable, or recorded for later analysis.

Baited cameras are highly effective at attracting [[scavenger]]s and subsequent [[Predation|predators]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilson RR Jr, Smith KL Jr (1984) Effect of near-bottom currents on detection of bait by the abyssal grenadier fishes Coryphaenoides spp., recorded in situ with a video camera on a free vehicle.

Sloman, Katherine A. Sims, David W. Danylchuk, Andy J. (2011) ''Validating the use of baited remote underwater video surveys for assessing the diversity, distribution and abundance of sharks in the Bahamas'' Endangered Species Research, Vol. 13: 231–243, doi: 10.3354/esr00331 https://www.academia.edu/718540/Are_baited_remote_underwater_video_surveys_BRUVS_an_alternative_to_conventional_longline_surveys_for_determining_the_diversity_and_relative_abundance_#&lt;/ref&gt;

As a non-extractive technique, it offers a low environmental impact way of understanding changes in fish numbers and diversity over time. BRUV surveys were developed in Australia, and are now used around the world for a variety of projects. This is a low budget monitoring system that is less reliant on the availability of skilled labour and may make sustainable monitoring more practical, over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;''Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) survey of False Bay’s icthyofauna'' http://www.saeon.ac.za/enewsletter/archives/2013/february2013/doc01 accessed 3 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main types of remote video technique which have been used to record [[reef fish]] populations. They can both be left free standing without the need of an operator. The first system uses one downward looking camera (D-BRUV), and the other uses either one (mono) or two (stereo) horizontally facing cameras (H-BRUV),&lt;ref&gt;Tim Langlois, Pascale Chabanet, Dominique Pelletier, Euan Harvey (2006) ''Baited underwater video for assessing reef fish populations in marine reserves'', SPC Fisheries Newsletter #118 – July/September 2006, 53&lt;/ref&gt; and may use underwater lighting to illuminate the target area. Stereo BRUV recordings can use software analysis to determine the size of specimens.

The colour of the lighting used for video may influence behaviour of the target species.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Erika H. &amp; Widder, Edith A.''Behavioral responses of two deep-sea fish species to red, far-red, and white light.'' Marine Ecology Progress Series, Vol. 350: 291–298, 2007 doi: 10.3354/meps07196&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chairlift_bullwheel.jpg|thumb|A chairlift's return bullwheel]]

A '''bullwheel''' or '''bull wheel''' is a large [[wheel]] on which a [[rope]] turns, such as in a [[chairlift]]. In that application, the bullwheel that is attached to the [[Wiktionary:prime mover|prime mover]] is called the drive bullwheel, and the other is the return bullwheel.

Originally, ''bullwheel'' was an [[oil field]] term applied to the large wheel that turns the drum upon which the drilling line is wound in [[percussion drilling]].

The bullwheel began use in [[farm implements]] with the [[reaper]].  The term described the traveling wheel, traction wheel, drive wheel, or harvester wheel. The bullwheel powered all the moving parts of these farm machines including the reciprocating knives, reel, rake, and self binder.  The bullwheel's outer surface provided traction against the ground and turned when the draft animals or [[tractor]] pulled the implement forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Chatham University''' is an American [[university]] that has [[coeducational]] academic programs through the doctoral level, with its main campus located in the [[Shadyside (Pittsburgh)|Shadyside]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States. Chatham University maintains its Eastside Campus at the corner of Shadyside and the [[East Liberty (Pittsburgh)|East Liberty]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chatham.edu/about/eastside.cfm |title=Chatham Eastside &amp;#124; Chatham University, Pittsburgh, PA |website=Chatham.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campus serves the Health Sciences and Architecture programs. In 2013, Chatham opened its Eden Hall Campus to house the Falk School of Sustainability and is located in the Pittsburgh suburb of Pine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chatham.edu/edenhall/ |title=Eden Hall Campus &amp;#124; Chatham University, Pittsburgh, PA |website=Chatham.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current university student population of 2,110 includes 1,002 undergraduate students and 1,108 graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chatham Quick Facts|url=http://www.chatham.edu/about/quickfacts.cfm|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University grants certificates and degrees including bachelor, master, first-professional, and doctorate in the School of Arts, Science, and Business, the School of Health Sciences, and the Falk School of Sustainability.

==History==
Founded as the '''Pennsylvania Female College''' on December 11, 1869, by Reverend William Trimble Beatty (the father of renowned operatic [[contralto]] [[Louise Homer]]), Chatham was initially situated in the Berry mansion on Woodland Road off Fifth Avenue in the neighborhood of Shadyside. The campus today is composed of buildings and grounds from a number of former private mansions, including those of [[Andrew Mellon]], Edward Stanton Fickes, George M. Laughlin Jr. and James Rea.  It was renamed '''Pennsylvania College for Women''' in 1890, and as '''Chatham College''' in 1955.  The name served to honor [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]] and namesake of the City of [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;cc=ascead;q1=chatham%20university;rgn=main;view=text;didno=US-PPiU-dar192508 William Pitt Family Papers, 1757-1804], DAR.1925.08, [[The Darlington Collection]], Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh&lt;/ref&gt;  The school gained [[university]] status from the [[Pennsylvania Department of Education]] on April 23, 2007, and publicly announced its new status on 2007-05-01, changing its name to Chatham University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07121/782468-100.stm|accessdate=2009-08-16|date=2007-05-01|first=Tim|last=Grant|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|title=Chatham gains university status}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With elements designed for the original Andrew Mellon estate by the [[Olmsted Brothers]], the {{convert|39|acre|ha|sing=on}} Chatham campus was designated an [[arboretum]] in 1998 by the American Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta.  It features over 115 different varieties of species, including Japanese Flowering Crabapple, [[River Birch]] and [[Kentucky Coffee Tree]].

In 2005 the University expanded its programs to include online advanced degree programs (bachelors, masters, doctoral) through the School of Continuing Education, now the College for Continuing and Professional Studies.  Two years later, Chatham's M.F.A. Program in Creative Writing was named one of the top five Innovative/Unique Programs by ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200708/mfa-programs|accessdate=2009-08-16|year=2007|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly|title=The Best of the Best|first=Edward J.|last=Delaney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatham received some national attention in 2014 when it announced that it was engaging in a period of study "considering admitting men for the first time in that college's history,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schackner |first=Bill |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/breaking/2014/02/18/Chatham-U-trustees-approve-resolution-to-study-going-all-coed/stories/201402180194 |title=Chatham University considers enrolling men as undergraduate students &amp;#124; Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |website=Post-gazette.com |date=2014-02-18 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in "reactions of surprise and anger" from its alumnae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schackner |first=Bill |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2014/02/19/Chatham-graduates-express-shock-at-possible-co-ed-move-wage-fight-to-keep-undergraduate-college-single-sex/stories/201402190157 |title=Coed possibility concerns Chatham alumnae &amp;#124; Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |website=Post-gazette.com |date=2014-02-19 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
The current president of Chatham University is David Finegold, DPhil. Dr. Finegold, a graduate of Harvard University and a Rhodes Scholar who received his doctorate from Oxford University, became the 19th president in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President's Bio|url=https://www.chatham.edu/about/presidents_bio.cfm|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the retirement of [[Esther Barazzone|Dr. Esther Barazzone]] after a 24-year tenure.

==Campuses==
The original Shadyside Campus is part of historic Woodland Road. The Shadyside Campus now includes Chatham Eastside,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chatham.edu/news/story.cfm?ID=316 Chatham.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421004254/http://www.chatham.edu/news/story.cfm?ID=316 |date=2009-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which serves as the home for health science and architecture programs. 
 
The University's new {{convert|388|acre|ha|adj=on}} Eden Hall Campus is located north of the city in Richland Township, Pa. and is the home of Chatham's new Falk School of Sustainability. Programs at Eden Hall Campus include a BS/BA in Sustainability, a Masters in Sustainability, an MFA in Food Studies, and a dual degree Masters in Sustainability / Masters in Business Administration. The Eden Hall Campus was donated to Chatham University by the Eden Hall Foundation on May 1, 2008. In 2011, the University engaged the architectural team of Berkebile Nelson Immenschuh McDowell (BNIM) of Kansas City, Mo. and the landscape design firm Andropogon Associates of Philadelphia to lead the master planning process. The first phase of development, which won an award for sustainable development was completed by the firm Mithun in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mithun.com/project/chatham-university-eden-hall-campus/?from=featured|title=Chatham University Eden Hall Campus - Mithun|work=Mithun|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chatham.edu/news/index.php/2017/04/chatham-news/eden-hall-campus-receives-american-institute-of-architects-award-for-sustainable-design-excellence|title=Eden Hall Campus receives American Institute of Architects Award for Sustainable Design Excellence|date=2017-04-20|work=Chatham News|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
Chatham University teams, also known as the Cougars, participate as a member of the [[NCAA Division III]]. The Cougars are a member of the [[Presidents' Athletic Conference]] (PAC). Women's sports include basketball, cross country, ice hockey, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball. Men's and women's ice hockey play in the [[United Collegiate Hockey Conference]].

The women's ice hockey team was the first NCAA women's ice hockey team in Pennsylvania.

The college mascot was previously Pennsy the Seal. The cougar mascot was adopted in 1992 and was named Carson in honor of alumna [[Rachel Carson]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="mascot"/&gt;

==Notable alumnae==
Among Chatham's notable alumnae is [[biologist]] and [[zoologist]] [[Rachel Carson]] (1929), after whom the Rachel Carson Institute at Chatham is named.  The RCI, as it is known, promotes understanding of [[environmentalism|environmental]] issues through conferences, lectures, discussion panels, and other methods.  In honor of Rachel Carson's legacy, the University President, Esther L. Barazzone, Ph.D. and others led a campaign to rename the Ninth Street Bridge in [[Downtown Pittsburgh]] as the [[Rachel Carson Bridge]].  The naming resolution was passed by [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] Council on December 6, 2005.  The Rachel Carson Bridge is one of the "Three Sisters" Bridges, opened between 1926 and 1928, and designed by County architect Stanley L. Roush and the Allegheny County Department of Public Works. The [[Roberto Clemente Bridge]] (formerly Sixth Street Bridge) and the [[Andy Warhol Bridge]] (formerly Seventh Street Bridge) complete the trio of bridges. They are the only trio of nearly identical bridges and were the first self-anchored suspension spans built in the United States. They are among the only surviving examples of large [[eyebar]]-[[chain]] [[suspension bridge]]s in the country.

Other notable alumnae include:

*[[Catherine Chisholm Cushing]], playwright
*[[Kathie L. Olsen]] ’74, Ph.D., past deputy director, [[National Science Foundation]]
*[[Elaine Scarry]] Ph.D. ’68, author and Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value at [[Harvard University]]
*[[Lea Wait]] ’68, author of mystery novels, and children's books
*[[Lesley B. Wells|Lesley Brooks Wells]] ’59, [[United States District Judge]]

'''Codarts University for the Arts''' ({{lang-nl|Codarts hogeschool voor de kunsten}}) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[vocational university]] in [[Rotterdam]] that teaches music, dance and circus. It was established in its present location in 2000.

==History==

Codarts can trace its origins to the  Rotterdam Conservatorium voor Muziek (Rotterdam Conservatory of Music), popularly known as the Conservatorium Holthaus after its director, Jos Holthaus (1879-1943).&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;
In 1930 the alternative Rotterdamsch Toonkunst Conservatorium (Rotterdam Musical Arts Conservatory) was founded with the composer [[Willem Pijper]] as director.&lt;ref name=Historici/&gt;
The Rotterdamse Dansschool (Rotterdam Dance School) was established in 1931 by [[Corrie Hartong]] as director and the German dancer [[Gertrud Leistikow]] as a teacher.&lt;ref name=Historici/&gt;  
At first the dance school was part of the Conservatorium Holthaus.&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;
In 1935 the dance school transferred to Pijper's conservatory.  
Hartong remained as director. She was to stay in this position until 1961, and continued to teach until 1967.&lt;ref name=Historici/&gt;

[[World War II]] broke out in 1939 and the Netherlands were invaded in May 1940. On 14 May 1940 the buildings of the dance school and the main building of Pijper's conservatory were destroyed by bombs.  It was decided to merge Pijper's and Holthaus's conservatories into one building on Mathenesserlaan, where Holthaus had a branch.
Soon they moved again to a big old house that had somehow been spared, totally surrounded by rubble, and managed to continue day classes and early evening classes before curfew throughout the remainder of the war.
Until Holthaus died in 1943 the combined conservatory had two directors.&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;

The Rotterdamse Dansschool was renamed the Rotterdamse Dansacademie (Rotterdam Dance Academy) in 1954.  In 1986 the Conservatory and Dance Academy became the Hogeschool voor Muziek en Theater Rotterdam (Rotterdam University of Music and Theatre).&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;
The school moved into its present modern building next to the [[De Doelen|Doelen]] concert hall in 2000 under the name Codarts - hogeschool voor de kunsten (Codarts - University of the Arts).&lt;ref name=Hoogstad/&gt;
The Circus arts program was launched in September 2006.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;

==Schools==
[[File:Codarts Big Band, conducted by Ilja Reijngoud.jpg|thumb|Codarts Big Band, conducted by [[Ilja Reijngoud]], at the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]], July 2008]]
Codarts has three divisions: the Rotterdam Conservatory, Rotterdam Dance Academy, and Rotterdam Circus Arts.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;

The Rotterdam Conservatory is one of the largest conservatories in the Netherlands, with over 900 pupils.
It offers courses through which students may obtain a bachelor's degree in any of several disciplines: Music Theater, Pop, Jazz, Composition/arranging, Music Production, Argentinean tango, Indian music, Flamenco, Latin/Latin jazz/Brazilian, Turkish music, Classical music, and Music in Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The school puts on public performances, at times using the adjacent [[De Doelen]] concert hall.
Thus in April 2011 guest conductor [[Arie van Beek]] led the Codarts Orchestra and Codarts Chamber Choir in a performance in the Jurriaanse Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In September 2011 the Codarts Ensemble performed a program that explored the boundary between classical music and jazz, 
with works by Stravinsky, Gershwin, Shostakovich, Antheil and Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Codarts Ensemble played again at De Doelen in March 2012 with the Codarts Chamber Choir, performing a major work by [[Arthur Honegger]].
They were conducted by [[Wiecher Mandemaker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dance Academy teaches dancers and arranges for students to appear in performances and tours.
Codarts helps students gain practical experience with internships with noted dance companies, and participates in student exchange programs with other European and American dance schools.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;
In May 2011 the Rotterdam Dance Academy performed at the [[Venice Biennale]] with a show called ''Talent on the Move''.
The program included works by established choreographers such as  [[Jiří Kylián]], [[Nacho Duato]] and [[Mauro Bigonzetti]] and by younger artists including graduates of the academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Circus Arts school began offering a bachelor's course in September 2006, training students for careers in [[Contemporary circus|contemporary]] and traditional circus, in [[variety show]]s and in local or street theater.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;
Circus students learn dance and drama as well as a wide range of circus techniques to prepare for a professional career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Havo voor Muziek en Dans]] (High School for Music and Dance) provides a secondary school education in which music and dance are part of the daily curriculum. It is co-located in the Codarts building and Codarts teachers teach the music and dance classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Building==
[[File:CodartsRotterdam2017.jpg|thumb|Codarts Rotterdam]]
The building abuts the 1966 [[De Doelen]] concert and conference building, home of the [[Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra
 |title=Concertgebouw de Doelen |language=Dutch
 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was built as part of an overall plan for an extension to De Doelen defined in 1993 by Jan Hoogstad.
A new building site beside the Kruisplein was created by reducing the size of Karel Doormanstraat, and this was used for the Doelen extension and the Codarts building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.mimoa.eu/projects/Netherlands/Rotterdam/De%20Doelen
 |title=DE DOELEN |work=Mimoa
 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The building was developed by the architectural firm of [[Jan Hoogstad|Ector Hoogstad]], and was completed in 2000.
The plinth is mainly used for commercial purposes.
The building is relatively high to accommodate all the demands of the school, and has a total floor space of {{convert|10500|m2}}.
Visually, the Codarts building appears to reach over the end of the conference center.&lt;ref name=Hoogstad/&gt;

The building's steel skeleton supports a "box in box" design for the interior spaces, including several tall spaces with variable lighting.
A long escalator connects the entrance lobby to the fifth floor.
This is the main floor for Codarts, holding the restaurant, library and several performance rooms, and opening onto a terrace on the roof of the Doelen extension.
Codarts occupies classrooms and offices below this floor.  
The conservatory is above it and the large dance studios are at the top of the building.
The building is clad in brick to give an appearance consistent with nearby apartment buildings.&lt;ref name=Hoogstad/&gt;

==Notable alumni==
* [[Henk van der Vliet]] (1950), Dutch composer and flautist
* [[Willemijn Verkaik#cite note-Nieuws-1|Willemijn Verkaik]], Dutch theatre actress, best known for playing Elphaba from the musical [[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]] in the Netherlands, Germany, New York and London.
* [[San Holo]], Dutch record producer and DJ.

[[File:Target set, states and strata in CST.jpg|thumb|Target set, states and strata in CST]]
'''Concept of Stratification''', labelled CST by Prof [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]], was proposed in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Zadeh, L. A. (2016). Stratification, target set reachability and incremental enlargement principle. Information Sciences, 354, 131-139.&lt;/ref&gt; Zadeh states that it is a reform in conventional [[problem solving]] methods by the consideration of a recursive problem solving approach.&lt;ref&gt;Asadabadi, M. R., Saberi, M., &amp; Chang, E. (2018). The Concept of Stratification and Future Applications. Applied Soft Computing.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that this concept should not be mistaken with other similar concepts such as [[social stratification]]. CST is not based on social stratification nor related to it. More particularly it is quite different from the previous versions and applications of stratiﬁcation, such as stratiﬁed logic, stratified approach, stratified programming, [[stratified analysis]], among other versions of stratification prior to 2016. This version of stratiﬁcation can handle a range of problems as explained a year after the original proposal by Asadabadi and his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Asadabadi, M. R., Saberi, M., &amp; Chang, E. (2018). The Concept of Stratification and Future Applications. Applied Soft Computing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The key innovation in CST is that it considers the target first, and then the target is gradually enlarged to include the system which is aimed to receive the target.&lt;ref&gt;Asadabadi, M. R., Saberi, M., &amp; Chang, E. (2017, July). Logistic informatics modelling using concept of stratification (CST). In Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE), 2017 IEEE International Conference on (pp. 1-7). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; After the system is contained in the enlarged target, the target gradually shrinks to let the system find the target.&lt;ref&gt;Asadabadi, M. R., Saberi, M., &amp; Chang, E. Targets of Unequal Importance Using the Concept of Stratification in a Big Data Environment. International Journal of Fuzzy Systems, 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt; This method has similarities to the human mind problem solving &lt;ref&gt;Asadabadi, M. R. (2018). The stratified multi-criteria decision-making ([[Multiple-criteria decision analysis|MCDM]]) method. Knowledge-Based Systems.&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to be employed widely in [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) in near future.&lt;ref&gt;Asadabadi, M. R., Saberi, M., &amp; Chang, E. (2018).

Efforts to save endangered species may, paradoxically, lead to '''conservation-induced extinction''' of other species. This mostly threatens the parasite and pathogen species that are highly host-specific to critically endangered hosts. When the last individuals of a host species are captured for the purpose of captive breeding and reintroduction programs, they typically undergo anti-parasitic treatments to increase survival and reproductive success. This practice may unintentionally result in the extinction of the species antagonistic to the target species, such as certain parasites. It has been proposed that the parasites should be reintroduced to the endangered population. A few cases of conservation-induced extinction have occurred in parasitic [[lice]].&lt;ref name="Rózsa2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rózsa | first=Lajos | last2=Vas | first2=Zoltán | title=Co-extinct and critically co-endangered species of parasitic lice, and conservation-induced extinction: should lice be reintroduced to their hosts? | journal=Oryx | volume=49 | issue=01 | date=2014-08-22| doi=10.1017/s0030605313000628 | pages=107–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* Parasite: ''[[Colpocephalum californici]]'' – host: [[California condor]]&lt;ref name = Dunn&gt;Dunn RR 2009. Coextinction: anecdotes, models, and speculation. In Holocene Extinctions (ed. S.T. Turvey), pp. 167–180. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
:The parasite most probably became extinct when the last individuals of its only host species were captured for a captive-breeding program; all parasites found were deliberately killed in an attempt to assist the host's survival.&lt;ref name="Stringer2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stringer |first1=Andrew Paul |last2=Linklater |first2=Wayne |title=Everything in Moderation: Principles of Parasite Control for Wildlife Conservation |journal=BioScience |date=2014 |volume=64 |issue=10 |pages=932–937 |doi=10.1093/biosci/biu135 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parasite: ''Rallicola (Aptericola) pilgrimi'' – host: [[little spotted kiwi]]&lt;ref name = Buckley&gt;Buckley TR, Palma RL, Johns PM, Gleeson DM, Heath ACG, Hitchmough RA, Stringer IAN 2012. The conservation status of small or less well known groups of New Zealand terrestrial invertebrates. ''New Zealand Entomologist'' '''35:''' 137–143.&lt;/ref&gt;
:The parasite most probably became extinct when the last individuals of its only host species were captured and, after routine veterinary antiparasitic treatments, re-introduced into predator-free islands.
* Parasite: ''Rallicola (Rallicola) guami'' – host: [[Guam rail]]
:The only known host species of this parasite exists exclusively in captivity and kept under veterinary control. No information about the fate of the parasite, likely extinct.
* Parasite: ''Linognathus petasmatus'' – host: [[scimitar-horned oryx]]
:The host specificity of this parasite is uncertain. Either it was specific to the scimitar-horned oryx and became extinct during captive breeding of the host, or – alternatively – it may be specific to the [[addax]] and possibly still surviving in the wild.

==Erroneous example==

* “The Trichodectid lice of the [[black-footed ferret]]” has been mentioned in the literature several times&lt;ref name = Gompper&gt;Gompper ME, Williams ES 1998. Parasite conservation and the black-footed ferret recovery program. ''Conservation Biology'' '''12:''' 730–732.&lt;/ref&gt; as a parasite that became extinct during the captive breeding program of the host. However, this parasite most probably never existed as a separate species.&lt;ref name="Rózsa2014"/&gt;

==Current example==

Parasite species that are specific to a single host species are endangered whenever the host is to be saved by captive breeding programs. A current example is the louse ''Felicola isidoroi'', a louse parasitizing the [[Iberian lynx]].&lt;ref name = Felicola&gt;Pérez, J.M.; Sánchez, I. &amp; Palma, R.L. (2013). The dilemma of conserving parasites: the case of ''Felicola (Lorisicola) isidoroi'' (Phthiraptera: Trichodectidae) and its host, the endangered Iberian lynx (''Lynx pardinus''). ''Insect Conservation and Diversity'' '''6:''' 680–686.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is designed for computer processing, allowing the generation of identification keys, [[diagnosis]], etc. 

It is widely accepted as a standard, one of only a few such standards. Quite a bit of software is available for various tasks, using this format. There is a website on DELTA, linking to many databases in this format.

It was devised by the [[CSIRO]] Australian Division of Entomology in 1971 to 2000, with a notable part taken by Dr. Michael J. Dallwitz.

'''Environmental determinism''' (also known as '''climatic determinism''' or '''geographical determinism''') is the study of how the [[physical environment]] predisposes societies and states towards particular development trajectories. Nineteenth-century approaches held that climate and terrain largely determined human activity and psychology, and it was associated with institutionalized racism and [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Semple|first1=Ellen Churchhill|title=Influences of Geographic Environment, on the Basis of Ratzel's System of Anthropo-Geography|date=1911|publisher=H. Holt &amp; Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars underscore that this approach supported [[colonialism]] and [[eurocentrism]], and devalued human agency in non-Western societies.&lt;ref name="Gilmartin, M. 2009 pp. 115-123"&gt;Gilmartin, M. (2009). "Colonialism/Imperialism". Key concepts in political geography (pp. 115–123). London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sluyter|first1=Ander|title=Neo-Environmental Determinism, Intellectual Damage Control, and Nature/Society Science|journal=Antipode-Blackwell|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]], [[Jeffrey Herbst]], [[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morris]], and other social scientists sparked a revival of the theory during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. This "neo-environmental determinism" school of thought examines how geographic and ecological forces influence [[state-building]], [[economic development]], and [[institutions]].

==A history of thought==

===Classical and medieval periods===
Early theories of environmental determinism in [[Ancient China]], [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]] suggested that environmental features completely determined the physical and intellectual qualities of whole societies. [[Guan Zhong]] (720–645 BC), an [[Spring and Autumn period|early]] chancellor in China, held that the qualities of major rivers shaped the character of surrounding peoples. Swift and twisting rivers made people "greedy, uncouth, and warlike".&lt;ref&gt;trans. Allyn Rickett (1998), in ''Guanzi: Political, Economic, and Philosophical Essays from Early China: A Study and Translation''. Volume II. Princeton University Press, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek philosopher [[Hippocrates]] wrote a similar account in his treatise "Airs, Waters, Places".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'' Princeton: Princeton University Press. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers in the medieval [[Middle East]] also produced theories of environmental determinism. The [[Afro-Arab]] writer [[al-Jahiz]] argued that the [[skin color]] of people and livestock were determined by the water, soil, and heat of their environments. He compared the color of black [[basalt]] in the northern [[Najd]] to the skin color of the peoples living there to support his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conrad | first1 = Lawrence I. | year = 1982 | title = Taun and Waba: Conceptions of Plague and Pestilence in Early Islam | url = | journal = Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient | volume = 25 | issue = 3| pages = 268–307 [278] | doi=10.2307/3632188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Khaldun]], the [[Sociology in medieval Islam|Arab sociologist]] and [[polymath]], similarly linked skin color to environmental factors. In his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), he wrote that black skin was due to the hot climate of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and not due to African lineage. He thereby challenged [[Hamitic]] theories of race that held that the sons of [[Ham (son of Noah)]] were cursed with black skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title='Race', slavery and Islam in Maghribi Mediterranean thought: the question of the Haratin in Morocco|first=Chouki|last=El Hamel|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|volume=7|issue=3|year=2002|pages=29–52 [39–42]|doi=10.1080/13629380208718472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many writings of Ibn Khaldun were translated during the colonial era in order to advance the colonial propaganda machine.&lt;ref&gt;Translation and the Colonial Imaginary: Ibn Khaldun Orientalist, by Abdelmajid Hannoum  © 2003 Wesleyan University. {{JSTOR|3590803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Khaldun believed that the physical environment influenced non-physical factors in addition to skin color. He argued that soil, climate, and food determined whether people were [[nomad]]ic or [[sedentism|sedentary]], and what customs and ceremonies they held. His writings may have influenced the later writings of [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] during the 18th century through the traveller [[Jean Chardin]], who travelled to Persia and described theories resembling those of Ibn Khaldun.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Spread of Ibn Khaldun's Ideas on Climate and Culture|author=Warren E. Gates|journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]|volume=28|issue=3|date=July–September 1967|pages=415–422|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|jstor=2708627|doi=10.2307/2708627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western colonial period===
{{main article|Impact of Western European colonialism and colonisation}}
Environmental determinism has been widely criticized as a tool to legitimize [[colonialism]], [[racism]], and [[imperialism]] in [[Africa]], [[North America]], [[South America]], and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="Gilmartin, M. 2009 pp. 115-123"/&gt; Environmental determinism enabled geographers to scientifically justify the supremacy of white European races and the naturalness of imperialism.&lt;ref name="Painter 2009, pg.177"&gt;Painter &amp; Jeffrey, "Political Geography", Sage Publications, 2009, pg.177.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholarship bolstered religious justifications and in some cases superseded them during the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="J.A. Campbell 1983"&gt;J.A. Campbell &amp; D.N. Livingstone, "Neo-Lemarckism and the Development of Geography in the United States and Great Britain," Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 8 (1983): 278&lt;/ref&gt;

Many writers, including [[Thomas Jefferson]], supported and legitimized African colonization by arguing that tropical climates made the people uncivilized. Jefferson argued that tropical climates encouraged laziness, relaxed attitudes, promiscuity and generally degenerative societies, while the frequent variability in the weather of the middle and northern latitudes led to stronger work ethics and civilized societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jefferson|first1=Thomas|editor1-last=Gates|editor1-first=Henry Louis|editor2-last=Burton|editor2-first=Jennifer|title=Call and Response: Key Debates in African American Studies|date=2011|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-97578-9|pages=17–24|chapter=Notes on the State of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] also made use of this theory to extol the supremacy of the [[Nordic race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carolynyeager.net/why-we-are-antisemites-text-adolf-hitlers-1920-speech-hofbr%C3%A4uhaus|title="Why We Are Antisemites" - Text of Adolf Hitler's 1920 speech at the Hofbräuhaus|author=Carolyn Yeager|date=29 January 2013|work=carolynyeager.net|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defects of character supposedly generated by tropical climates were believed to be inheritable under the [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] theory of [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]], a discredited precursor to the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="J.A. Campbell 1983"/&gt; The outdated theory begins with the observation that an organism faced with environmental pressures may undergo physiological changes during its lifetime through the process of [[acclimatization]]. Lamarckianism suggested that those physiological changes may be passed directly to offspring, without the need for offspring to develop the trait in the same manner.&lt;ref&gt;Lamarck, 1809: 124 in Ernst Mayr, "Lamarck Revisited," Journal of the History of Biology 5 (1972): 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographical societies like the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and the [[Société de géographie]] supported imperialism by funding explorers and other colonial proponents.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmartin, M. (2009). "Colonialism/Imperialism". Key concepts in political geography (pg 117). London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific societies acted similarly. [[Acclimatisation society|Acclimatization societies]] directly supported colonial enterprises and enjoyed their benefits. The writings of Lamarck provided theoretical backing for the acclimatization doctrines. The Société Zoologique d'Acclimatation was largely founded by [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]—son of [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], a close colleague and supporter of Lamarck.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Michael A. "Acclimatizing the World: A History of the Paradigmatic Colonial Science." Osiris 15 (2000): 138, 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ellen Churchill Semple]], a prominent environmental determinism scholar, applied her theories in a case study which focused on the [[Philippines]], where she mapped civilization and wildness onto the [[topography]] of the islands.&lt;ref name="Painter 2009, pg.177" /&gt; Other scholars argued that climate and topography caused specific character traits to appear in a given populations. Scholars thereby imposed racial stereotypes on whole societies.&lt;ref name="Painter 2009, pg.177" /&gt; Imperial powers rationalized [[Exploitation of labour|labor exploitation]] by claiming that tropical peoples were morally inferior.&lt;ref&gt;Shirlow, Peter, Gallaher, Carolyn, Gilmartin, Mary, "Key Concepts in Political Geography", SAGE Publications Ldt, 2009, pg.127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of environmental determinism in rationalizing and legitimizing [[racism]], [[ethnocentrism]] and [[economic inequality]] has consequently drawn strong criticism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Painter &amp; Jeffrey, "Political Geography", Sage Publications, 2009, pg.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern scientists have also critiqued classical environmental determinism as unscientific. [[Carl O. Sauer|Carl Sauer]] criticized the premature generalizations resulting from bias in environmentalism in 1924. He argued that to define [[geography]] as the study of environmental influences is to assume in advance that such influences do operate, and that science cannot be based upon or committed to preconceptions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Furthermore, since [[evolution|evolutionary change]] manifests over very long time periods, some argue that the ability to adequately correlate human behaviour with any specific environmental condition is speculative at best and impossible at worst.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[David Landes]] similarly condemns of what he terms the unscientific moral geography of [[Ellsworth Huntington]]. He argues that Huntington undermined geography as a science by attributing all human activity to physical influences so that he might classify civilizations hierarchically – favoring those civilizations he considered best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landes|first1=David|title=The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some are So Rich and Some So Poor|ISBN= 0-393-04017-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late-20th-century growth of neo-environmental determinism===
Environmental determinism was revived in the late-twentieth century as neo-environmental determinism. The new term coined by the [[social science|social scientist]] and critic [[Andrew Sluyter]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Sluyter argues that neo-environmental determinism does not sufficiently break with its classical and imperial precursors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Neo-environmental determinism examines how the physical environment predisposes societies and states towards particular trajectories of economic and political development. It explores how geographic and ecological forces influence [[state-building]], [[economic development]], and [[institutions]]. It also addresses fears surrounding the [[effects of global warming|effects of modern climate change]].&lt;ref name="Sage Publications"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthews, Bartlein, Briffa, Dawson, Vernal, Denham, Fritz, Oldfield|title=The SAGE Handbook of Environmental Change|date=2012|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=978-0-85702-360-5|pages=1–447}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] was influential in the resurgence of environmental determinism due to the popularity of his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', which addresses the geographic origins of state formation prior to 1500 A.D.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS"&gt;{{cite book | author=Diamond, J. | title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company | date=March 1997 | isbn=0-393-03891-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-environmental determinism scholars debate how much the [[physical environment]] shapes economic and political [[institutions]]. Economic historians [[Stanley Engerman]] and [[Kenneth Sokoloff]] argue that [[factor endowments]] greatly affected "institutional" development in the Americas, by which they mean the tendency to more free (democratic, free market) or unfree (dictatorial, economically restrictive) regimes.

In contrast, [[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]], and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]] underscore that the geographic factors most influenced institutional development during early state formation and [[colonialism]]. They argue that geographic differences cannot explain economic growth disparities after 1500 A.D. directly, except through their effects on economic and political institutions.&lt;ref name="Crown Business"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Robinson|first2=James|title=Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty|date=2012|publisher=Crown Business|location=New York|isbn=978-0307719218|pages=1–546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists [[Jeffrey Sachs]] and [[John Luke Gallup]] have examined the direct impacts of geographic and climatic factors on economic development, especially the role of geography on the cost of trade and access to markets, the disease environment, and agricultural productivity.&lt;ref name="Geography and Economic Development"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallup, Sachs, and Mellinger|title=Geography and Economic Development|journal=International Regional Science Review|date=August 1999|issue=22|pages=179–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary [[global warming]] crisis has also impacted environmental determinism scholarship. [[Jared Diamond]] draws similarities between the [[climate change|changing climate conditions]] that brought down the [[Easter Island]] civilization and [[global warming]] in his book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diamond|first1=Jared|title=Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed|date=January 4, 2011|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|isbn=0140279512|pages=1–621}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Kolata, Charles Ortloff, and Gerald Huag similarly describe the [[Tiwanaku empire]] and [[Maya civilization]] collapses as caused by climate events such as [[drought]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolata|first1=Alan L.|last2=Ortloff|first2=Charles|title=Thermal Analysis of Tiwanaku Raised Field Systems in the Lake Titicaca Basin of Bolivia|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=October 1989|volume=16|pages=233–263|doi=10.1016/0305-4403(89)90004-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huag|first1=Gerald|title=Climate and the Collapse of Maya Civilization|journal=Science|date=March 2003|volume=299|issue=5613|pages=1731–1735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter deMenocal, Just as the earthworks in the deserts of the west grew out of notions of landscape painting, the growth of public art stimulated artists to engage the urban landscape as another environment and also as a platform to engage ideas and concepts about the environment to a larger audience.

== Ecological and geographic impacts on early state formation ==
{{main article|State formation}}

===Effects of species endowments, climate, and continental axes prior to 1500===
{{main article|Guns, Germs, and Steel}}
In the [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' (1999), author [[Jared Diamond]] points to geography as the answer to why certain states were able to grow and develop faster and stronger than others. His theory cited the natural environment and raw materials a civilization was blessed with as factors for success, instead of popular century old claims of racial and cultural superiority. Diamond says that these natural endowments began with the dawn of man, and favored Eurasian civilizations due to their location along similar latitudes, suitable farming climate, and early animal domestication.&lt;ref name="Guns, Germs, and Steel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diamond|first1=Jared|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel|date=1997|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond argues that early states located along the same latitude lines were uniquely suited to take advantage of similar climates, making it easier for crops, livestock, and farming techniques to spread. Crops such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]] were simple to grow and easy to harvest, and regions suitable for their cultivation saw high population densities and the growth of early cities. The ability to domesticate herd animals, which had no natural fear of humans, high birth rates, and an innate hierarchy, gave some civilizations the advantages of free labor, fertilizers, and war animals. The east-west orientation of Eurasia allowed for knowledge capital to spread quickly, and writing systems to keep track of advanced farming techniques gave people the ability to store and build upon a knowledge base across generations. Craftsmanship flourished as a surplus of food from farming allowed some groups the freedom to explore and create, which lead to the development of [[metallurgy]] and advances in technology. While the advantageous geography helped to develop early societies, the close proximity in which humans and their animals lived led to the spread of disease across Eurasia. Over several centuries, rampant disease decimated populations, but ultimately led to disease resistant communities. Diamond suggests that these chains of causation led to European and Asian civilizations holding a dominant place in the world today.&lt;ref name="Guns, Germs, and Steel"/&gt;

Diamond uses the Spanish [[conquistador|conquistadors']] conquering of the Americas as a case study for his theory. He argues that the Europeans took advantage of their environment to build large and complex states complete with advanced technology and weapons. The [[Incans]] and other native groups were not as blessed, suffering from a north–south orientation that prevented the flow of goods and knowledge across the continent. The Americas also lacked the animals, metals, and complex writing systems of Eurasia which prevented them from achieving the military or biological protections needed to fight off the European threat.&lt;ref name="Guns, Germs, and Steel"/&gt;

Diamond's theory has not gone without criticism.
* It was notably attacked for not providing enough detail regarding causation of environmental variables, and for leaving logical gaps in reasoning. Geographer Andrew Sluyter argued that Diamond was just as ignorant as the racists of the 19th century. Sluyter challenged Diamond's theory since it seemed to suggest that environmental conditions lead to gene selection, which then lead to wealth and power for certain civilizations. Sluyter also attacks environmental determinism by condemning it as a highly studied and popular field based entirely on Diamond's "quick and dirty" combination of natural and social sciences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
* [[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]] similarly criticized Diamond's work in their book ''[[Why Nations Fail]]''. They contend that the theory is outdated and can not effectively explain differences in economic growth after 1500 or the reasons why states that are geographically close can exhibit vast differences in wealth. They instead favored an institutional approach in which a societies success or failure is based on the underlying strength of its institutions.&lt;ref name="Crown Business"/&gt;

===Geography and pre-colonial African state-building  ===

==== The effects of climate and land abundance on the development of state systems ====
{{main article|States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control}}

In his book ''[[States and Power in Africa]]'', political scientist [[Jeffrey Herbst]] argues that environmental conditions help explain why, in contrast to other parts of the world such as Europe, many pre-colonial societies in Africa did not develop into dense, settled, hierarchical societies with strong state control that competed with neighboring states for people and territory.&lt;ref name="cul.columbia.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=James|title=States and Power in Africa: By Jeffrey I. Herbst: A Review Essay|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|date=June 2002|volume=40|issue=2|pages=510–19|doi=10.1257/002205102320161357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbst argues that the European state-building experience was highly idiosyncratic because it occurred under systemic geographic pressures that favored wars of conquest – namely, passable [[terrain]], land [[scarcity]], and [[population densities|high-population densities]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tilly|first1=Charles|title=Coercion, Capital, and European States, A.D. 990–1992|date=1990|publisher=Blackwell|location=Cambridge, MA|page=63|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with the constant threat of war, political elites sent administrators and armed forces from the urban centers into rural hinterlands to raise taxes, recruit soldiers, and fortify buffer zones. European states consequently developed strong institutions and capital-periphery linkages.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

By contrast, geographic and climatic factors in pre-colonial Africa made establishing absolute control over particular pieces of land prohibitively costly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herbst|first1=Jeffry|title=States and Power in Africa|date=2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-01027-7|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, because African farmers relied on rain-fed agriculture and consequently invested little in particular pieces of land, they could easily flee rulers rather than fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herbst|first1=Jeffry|title=States and Power in Africa|date=2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-01027-7|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early African empires, like the [[Ashanti Empire]], successfully projected power over large distances by building roads.The largest pre-colonial polities arose in the [[Sudanian Savanna]] belt of West Africa because the horses and camels could transport armies over the terrain. In other areas, no centralized political organizations existed above the village level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herbst|first1=Jeffry|title=States and Power in Africa|date=2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-01027-7|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African states did not develop more responsive institutions under [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial rule]] or [[Decolonisation of Africa|post-independence]]. Colonial powers had little incentive to develop state institutions to protect their colonies against invasion, having divided up Africa at the [[Berlin Conference]]. The colonizers instead focused on exploting natural resources and [[exploitation colonialism]].&lt;ref name="cul.columbia.edu"/&gt;

==== The effect of disease environments ====
Dr. Marcella Alsan argues the prevalence of the [[tsetse fly]] hampered early state formation in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Alsan"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alsan|first=Marcella|date=January 2015|title=The Effect of the Tsetse Fly on African Development|url=https://fsi.stanford.edu/publications/the_effect_of_the_tsetse_fly_on_african_development|journal=American Economic Review|volume=105|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the tsetse virus was lethal to cows and horses, communities afflicted by the insect could not rely on the agricultural benefits provided by [[livestock]]. African communities were prevented from stockpiling agricultural surplus, working the land, or eating meat. Because the disease environment hindered the formation of farming communities, early African societies resembled small [[hunter-gatherer]] groups and not centralized states.&lt;ref name="Alsan"/&gt;

The relative availability of livestock animals enabled European societies to form centralized institutions, develop advanced technologies, and create an agricultural network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Overton|first1=Mark|title=Agricultural Revolution in England: The Transformation of the Agrarian Economy 1500–1850|date=18 April 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They could rely on their livestock to reduce the need for manual labor. Livestock also diminished the [[comparative advantage]] of owning [[slaves]]. African societies relied on the use of rival tribesman as slave labor where the fly was prevalent, which impeded long-term societal cooperation.&lt;ref name="Alsan"/&gt;

Alsan argues that her findings support the view of [[Kenneth Sokoloff]] and [[Stanley Engerman]] that factor endowments shape state institutions.&lt;ref name="Alsan"/&gt;

===Llamas, chuño and the Inca Empire===
{{see also|Vertical archipelago}}
[[Carl Troll]] has argued that the development of the [[Inca Empire|Inca state]] in the central [[Andes]] was aided by conditions that allow for the elaboration of the [[staple food]] [[chuño]]. Chuño, which can be stored for long times, is made of [[potato]] dried at [[Freezing#Food_preservation|freezing]] temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern [[Peru]]vian highlands. Contradicting the link between the Inca state and dried potato is that other crops such as [[maize]] can also be preserved with only sun.&lt;ref name=Gade2016/&gt; Troll also argued that [[llama]]s, the Incas' [[pack animal]], can be found in their largest numbers in this very same region.&lt;ref name=Gade2016&gt;{{cite book |last=Gade |first=Daniel |date=2016 |title=Spell of the Urubamba: Anthropogeographical Essays on an Andean Valley in Space and Time |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319208480#aboutBook |chapter=Urubamba Verticality: Reflections on Crops and Diseases |location= |publisher= |page=86 |isbn=978-3-319-20849-7 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth considering that the maximum extent of the Inca Empire coincided with the greatest distribution of [[alpaca]]s and llamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hardoy |first=Jorge Henríque |date=1973 |title=Pre-Colombian Cities |url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=fbQJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=llama+inca+expansion+colombia+limi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rirv1B3ECv&amp;sig=eNEgkUGhfN1RQ2uoR71F2WF52Xw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFtZvGvZTZAhVJHJAKHeZYA_MQ6AEIdDAP#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page=24 |isbn=978-0802703804 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a third point Troll pointed out [[Irrigation in Peru|irrigation]] technology as advantageous to the Inca state-building.&lt;ref name=Gade1996&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gade |first1=Daniel W. |date=1996 |title=Carl Troll on Nature and Culture in the Andes (Carl Troll über die Natur und Kultur in den Anden)  |url= |journal=[[Erdkunde]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=301–316 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Troll theorized environmental influences on the Inca Empire, he opposed environmental determinism, arguing that culture lay at the core of the Inca civilization.&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt;

==Effects of geography on political regimes ==

Numerous scholars have argued that geographic and environmental factors affect the types of [[political regime]] that societies develop, and shape paths towards [[democracy]] versus [[dictatorship]].

=== The disease environment ===
{{main article|Why Nations Fail}}

[[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]], and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]] have achieved notoriety for demonstrating that diseases and terrain have helped shape tendencies towards democracy versus dictatorship, and through these economic growth and development. In their book ''[[Why Nations Fail]]'', as well as a paper titled ''The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson|first=Daron, Simon and James|date=December 2001|title=The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation|url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/4123|journal=The American Economic Review|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors show that the colonial disease environment shaped the tendency for Europeans to settle the territory or not, and whether they developed systems of agriculture and labor markets that were free and egalitarian versus exploitative and unequal. These choices of political and economic institutions, they argue, shaped tendencies to democracy or dictatorship over the following centuries.

===Factor endowments===
{{main article|Factor endowment}}

In order to understand the impact and creation of institutions during early state formation, economic historians [[Stanley Engerman]] and [[Kenneth Sokoloff]] examined the economic development of the Americas during colonization.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic development in the Americas since 1500: endowments and institutions|last=Engerman|first=Stanley L.|last2=Sokoloff|first2=Kenneth L.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780521251372|location=United States|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that the beginnings of the success or failure of American colonies were based on the specific [[factor endowments]] available to each colony. These endowments included the climate, soil profitability, crop potential, and even native population density. Institutions formed to take advantage of these factor endowments. Those that were most successful developed an ability to change and adapt to new circumstances over time. For example, the development of economic institutions, such as [[plantation]]s, was caused by the need for a large property and labor force to harvest sugar and tobacco, while smallholder farms thrived in areas where scale economies were absent. Though initially profitable, plantation colonies also suffered from large dependent populations over time as slaves and natives were given few rights, limiting the population available to drive future economic progress and technological development.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Factor endowments also influenced political institutions. This is demonstrated by the plantation owning elite using their power to secure long lasting government institutions and pass legislation that lead to the persistence of inequality society. Engerman and Sokoloff found smallholder economies to be more equitable since they discouraged an elite class from forming, and distributed political power democratically to most land-owning males. These differences in political institutions were also highly influential in the development of schools, as more equitable societies demanded an educated population to make political decisions. Over time these institutional advantages had exponential effects, as colonies with educated and free populations were better suited to take advantage of technological change during the industrial revolution, granting country wide participation into the booming free-market economy.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Engerman and Sokoloff conclude that while institutions heavily influenced the success of each colony, no individual type of institution is the source of economic and state growth. Other variables such as factor endowments, technologies, and the creation of property rights are just as crucial in societal development. To encourage state success an institution must be adaptable and suited to find the most economical source of growth. The authors also argue that while not the only means for success, institutional development has long lasting-economic and social effects on the state.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Other prominent scholars contest the extent to which [[factor endowments]] determine economic and political institutions.&lt;ref name="Easterly 3–39"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|last2=Levine|first2=Ross|date=January 2003|title=Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments influence economic development|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=50|pages=3–39|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(02)00200-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nugent 45–82"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nugent|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|date=March 2010|title=Are Factor Endowments Fate?|url=|journal=Revista de Historia Económica|volume=28|issue=1|pages=45–82|doi=10.1017/s0212610909990048|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American economists [[William Easterly]] and [[Ross Levine]] argue that economic development does not solely depend on geographic endowments—like temperate climates, disease-resistant climates, or soil favorable to [[cash crops]]. They stress that there is no evidence that geographic endowments influence country incomes other than through institutions.&lt;ref name="Easterly 3–39"/&gt; They observe that states like [[Burundi]] are poor—despite favorable environmental conditions like abundant rainfall and fertile soil—because of the damage wrought by colonialism. Other states like [[Canada]] with fewer endowments are more stable and have higher per capita incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|last2=Levine|first2=Ross|date=January 2003|title=Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments influence economic development|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=50|pages=3–5|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(02)00200-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Easterly and Levine further observe that studies of how the environment directly influences land and labor were tarred by racist theories of underdevelopment, but that does not mean that such theories can be automatically discredited. They argue that Diamond correctly stresses the importance of germs and crops in the very long-run of societal technological development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|last2=Levine|first2=Ross|date=January 2003|title=Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments influence economic development|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=50|page=6|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(02)00200-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They find that regression results support the findings of [[Jared Diamond]] and [[David Landes]] that factor endowments influence GDP per capita. However, Easterly and Levine's findings most support the view that long-lasting institutions most shape economic development outcomes. Relevant institutions include private property rights and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|last2=Levine|first2=Ross|date=January 2003|title=Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments influence economic development|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=50|page=27|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(02)00200-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey B. Nugent and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]] similarly challenge scholars like [[Barrington Moore, Jr.|Barrington Moore]] who hold that certain factor endowments and [[agricultural]] preconditions necessarily lead to particular political and economic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nugent|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|date=March 2010|title=Are Factor Endowments Fate?|url=|journal=Revista de Historia Económica|volume=28|issue=1|pages=47|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nugent and Robinson show that [[Economics of coffee|coffee economies]] in [[South America]] pursued radically different paths of political and economic development during the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Nugent 45–82"/&gt;

Some coffee states, like [[Costa Rica]] and [[Colombia]], passed laws like the [[Homestead Act of 1862]]. They favored smallholders, held elections, maintained small militaries, and fought fewer wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nugent|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|date=March 2010|title=Are Factor Endowments Fate?|url=|journal=Revista de Historia Económica|volume=28|issue=1|pages=50|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smallholder arrangements prompted widespread government investment in education. Other states like [[El Salvador]] and [[Guatemala]] produced coffee on plantations, where individuals were more disenfranchised. Whether a state became a smallholder or plantation state depended not on factor endowments but on norms established under [[colonialism]]—namely, legal statues determining access to land, the background of the governing elites, and the degree of permitted political competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nugent|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|date=March 2010|title=Are Factor Endowments Fate?|url=|journal=Revista de Historia Económica|volume=28|issue=1|pages=45|doi=10.1017/s0212610909990048|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nugent and Robinson thereby conclude that factor endowments alone do not determine economic or political institutions.

==Direct effects of geography on economic development==

===Effects of terrain on trade and productivity===

Historians have also noted population densities seem to concentrate on coastlines and that states with large coasts benefit from higher average incomes compared to those in landlocked countries. Coastal living has proven advantageous for centuries as civilizations relied on the coastline and waterways for trade, irrigation, and as a food source.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Conversely, countries without coastlines or navigable waterways are often less urbanized and have less growth potential due to the slow movement of knowledge capital, technological advances, and people. They also have to rely on costly and time consuming over-land trade, which usually results in lack of access to regional and international markets, further hindering growth. Additionally, interior locations tend to have both lower population densities and labor-productivity levels. However, factors including fertile soil, nearby rivers, and ecological systems suited for rice or wheat cultivation can give way to dense inland populations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Nathan Nunn]] and Diego Puga note that though rugged terrain usually makes farming difficult, prevents travel, and limits societal growth, early African states used harsh terrain to their advantage.&lt;ref name="Nunn 20–36"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nunn|first=Nathan|last2=Puga|first2=Diego|date=February 2012|title=Ruggedness: The Blessing of Bad Geography in Africa|url=http://dpuga.economics.utoronto.ca/research/rugged.pdf|journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=94|pages=20–36|doi=10.1162/rest_a_00161|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors used a terrain ruggedness index to quantify topographic heterogeneity across several regions of Africa, while simultaneously controlling for variables such as diamond availability and soil fertility. The results suggest that historically, ruggedness is strongly correlated with decreased income levels across the globe and has negatively impacted state growth over time. They note that harsh terrain limited the flow of trade goods and decreased crop availability, while isolating communities from developing knowledge capital. However, the study also demonstrated that the terrain had positive effects on some African communities by protecting them from the slave trade. Communities that were located in areas with rugged features could successfully hide from slave traders and protect their homes from being destroyed. The study found that in these areas rugged topography produced long-term economic benefits and aided post-colonial state formation.&lt;ref name="Nunn 20–36"/&gt;

===Effects of climate on productivity===

The impact that climate and water navigability have on economic growth and GDP per capita was studied by notable scholars including [[Paul Krugman]], [[Jared Diamond]], and [[Jeffrey Sachs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mellinger|first=Andrew D.|last2=Sachs|first2=Jeffrey D.|last3=Gallup|first3=John L.|date=1999|title=Climate, Water Navigability, and Economic Development (Working Paper)|url=|journal=Harvard Institute for International Development|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using variables to measure environmental determinism, such as climate, land composition, latitude, and the presence of infectious disease, they account for trends in worldwide economic development on local, regional and global scales. To do so, they measure economic growth with GDP per capita adjusted to purchasing power parity (PPP), while also taking into consideration population density and labor productivity .&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gallup, John Luke, Jeffrey D. Sachs and Andrew D. Mellinger. "Geography and Economic Development." International regional Science (1999 vol.22): 179–224. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic historians have found that societies in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] experience higher standards of living, and that as latitude increases north or south from the equator, levels of real GDP per capita also increases. Climate is closely correlated with agricultural production since without ideal weather conditions, agriculture alone will not produce the surplus supply needed to build and maintain economies. Locations with hot tropical climates often suffer underdevelopment due to low fertility of soils, excessive plant transpiration, ecological conditions favoring infectious diseases, and unreliable water supply. These factors can cause tropical zones to suffer a 30% to 50% decrease in productivity relative to temperate climate zones.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|last2=Levine|first2=Ross|date=January 2003|title=Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments influence economic development|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=50|pages=3–39|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(02)00200-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical infectious diseases that thrive in hot and moist equatorial climates cause thousands of deaths each year. They are also an economic drain on society due to high medical costs, and the unwillingness of foreign capital to invest in a sickly state. Because infectious diseases like malaria often need a warm ecology for growth, states in the mid to high latitudes are naturally protected from the devastating effects of disease.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Climatic determinism and colonization===
Climatic determinism, otherwise referred to as the ''equatorial paradox,'' is an aspect of [[economic geography]]. According to this theory, about 70% of a country's [[economic development]] can be predicted by the distance between that country and the [[equator]], and that the further from the equator a country is located, the more developed it tends to be. The theory is the central argument of [[Philip M. Parker]]'s ''Physioeconomics: The Basis for Long-Run Economic Growth'', in which he argues that since humans originated as tropical mammals, those who relocated to colder climates attempt to restore their physiological homeostasis through wealth-creation. This act includes producing more food, better housing, heating, warm clothes, etc. Conversely, humans that remained in warmer climates are more physiologically comfortable simply due to temperature, and so have less incentive to work to increase their comfort levels. Therefore, according to Parker [[GDP]] is a direct product of the natural compensation of humans to their climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Phillip|title=Physioeconomics The Basis for Long-Run Economic Growth|journal=The MIT Press|date=September 2000|pages=1–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political geographers have used climatic determinism ideology to attempt to predict and rationalize the history of civilization, as well as to explain existing or perceived social and cultural divides between peoples. Some argue that one of the first attempts geographers made to define the development of human geography across the globe was to relate a country's climate to human development. Using this ideology, many geographers believed they were able "to explain and predict the progress of human societies".&lt;ref name="Painter pg.177"&gt;Painter &amp; Jeffrey, "Political Geography", Sage Publications, 2009, pg.177&lt;/ref&gt; This led to warmer climate zones being "seen as producing less civilized, more degenerate peoples, in need of salvation by western colonial powers."&lt;ref name="Shirlow, Peter 2009, pg.117"&gt;Shirlow, Peter, Gallaher, Carolyn, Gilmartin, Mary, "Key Concepts in Political Geography", Sage Publications Ltd, 2009, pg.117.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ellsworth Huntington]] also travelled continental Europe in hopes of better understanding the connection between climate and state success, publishing his findings in ''The Pulse of Asia'', and further elaborating in ''Civilization and Climate''.&lt;ref name="sharp2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharp|first1=Jo|title=Geographies of Postcolonialism|date=2008|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Los Angeles, London|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the political geographers, a crucial component of his work was the belief that the climate of North-western Europe was ideal, with areas further north being too cold, and areas further south being too hot, resulting in lazy, laid-back populations.&lt;ref name="sharp2008" /&gt; These ideas were powerful connections to [[colonialism]], and may have played a role in the creation of the '[[Other (philosophy)#Imperialism and colonialism|other]]' and the literature that many used to justify taking advantage of less advanced nations.&lt;ref name="sharp2008" /&gt; Huntington also argued that climate can lead to the demise of even advanced civilizations through drought, food insecurity, and damages to economic production.&lt;ref name="Sage Publications"/&gt;

The '''external iliac veins''' are large [[vein]]s that connect the [[femoral vein]]s to the [[common iliac vein]]s.  Their origin is at the inferior margin of the [[inguinal ligament]]s and they terminate when they join the [[internal iliac vein]]s (to form the [[common iliac vein]]s).

Both external iliac veins are accompanied along their course by [[external iliac artery|external iliac arteries]].

==Structure==
A continuation of the [[femoral vein]],&lt;ref name="Lasts2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ihGmxzamekC|title=Last's Anatomy: Regional and Applied|author=Sinnatamby|first=Chummy S.|publisher=Churchill Livingstone Elsevier|year=2011|isbn=0-7020-4839-9|edition=12th|location=|place=Great Britain|pages=309|chapter=5|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the external iliac vein starts at the level of the inguinal ligament.&lt;ref name="BerganBunke-Paquette2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mozes|first1=Geza|last2=Gloviczki|first2=Peter|editor=John J. Bergan &amp; Nisha Bunke-Paquette|others=|title=The Vein Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0SeAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|edition=2nd|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|place=New York|isbn=978-0-19-539963-9|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It runs beside its corresponding artery and along the brim of the [[lesser pelvis]] to unite with the internal iliac vein anterior to the [[sacroiliac joint]] where it forms the common iliac vein.&lt;ref name="Reynolds2016"&gt;{{cite book|editor=James C Reynolds|last1=Netter|first1=Frank H.|title=The Netter Collection of Medical Illustrations: Digestive System: Part I - The Upper Digestive Tract|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhrYCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35|edition=2nd|volume=9|date=2017|publisher=Elsevier|place=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-323-38936-5|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The left external iliac vein remains medial to the artery along its whole path. The right external iliac vein is medial to the artery, but as it ascends, it runs posterior to it.&lt;ref name="BerganBunke-Paquette2014"/&gt;

The external iliac vein is crossed by the [[ureter]] and internal iliac artery which both extend towards the middle. In males it is crossed by the [[vas deferens]] and in females the [[Round ligament of uterus|round ligament]] and [[ovarian vessels]] cross it. [[Psoas major]] lies to its side, except where the artery intervenes.&lt;ref name=":Gray2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7FVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1228|title=Gray's Anatomy: The Anatomical Basis of Clinical Practice|last=Delancey|first=John O.L.|publisher=Elsevier|year=2016|isbn=978-0-7020-6851-5|editor=Standring|editor-first=Susan|edition=41st|location=|pages=1221–1236|chapter=73, True pelvis, pelvic floor and perineum|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The external iliac vein may have one valve, but often has no valves.&lt;ref name="BerganBunke-Paquette2014"/&gt;

In addition to pubic veins, the main tributaries of the external iliac veins are the [[inferior epigastric veins]] and the [[deep circumflex iliac vein]].&lt;ref name=":Gray2016"/&gt;

==Clinical significance and history==
In 1967, Cockett noted anatomical variations which predisposed to compression of the external iliac vein, amongst other veins. Although less common than [[May-Thurner syndrome]], it is being progressively documented due to modern imaging methods. Compression of the left external iliac vein by the right common iliac artery or left hypogastric artery can occur as it crosses over the vein into the pelvis. The right external iliac vein can similarly be compressed. Such compressions may contribute to [[deep vein thrombosis]].&lt;ref name="Chaar2017"&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeRubertis|first1=Brian|last2=Patel|first2=Rhasheet|editor=Cassius Iyad Ochoa Chaar|title=Current Management of Venous Diseases|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2dCDwAAQBAJ|accessdate=|year=2017|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-65226-9|pages=464–465|chapter=35, May-Thurner Syndrome: Diagnosis and Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure to develop or [[agenesis]] of the external iliac vein has been described in association with [[Klippel–Trenaunay syndrome]] &lt;ref name=":Gray2016"/&gt;

'''Fictional geography''' is the use of maps, text and imagery to create lands and territories to accompany works of fiction. Depending on the completeness and complexity of the work, varying media, levels of collaboration and a number of other factors, the depiction of geographical components to works of fiction can range from simple drawings of a small area as in ''[[The Twenty-One Balloons]]'' by [[William Pène du Bois]] to an entire fictional world as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[Tolkien]] or even an entire galaxy as in ''[[Star Trek]]'' and its variants.

==Middle-earth==
One of the most notable examples of fictional geography is that created by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] to produce the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]] and its expansion to include all of [[Middle-earth]].

[[Genetics|Genetic]] imbalance is to describe situation when the [[genome]] of a cell or organism has more copies of some genes than other genes due to [[chromosomal]] [[rearrangement reaction|rearrangements]] or [[aneuploidy]].
Changes in [[gene dosage]], the number of times a given gene is present in the [[cell nucleus]], can create a genetic imbalance.

== Effects ==
This imbalance in gene dosage alters the amount of a particular [[protein]] relative to all other proteins, and this alternation in the relative amounts of protein can have a variety of [[phenotypic]] effects. These effects are depending on how the proteins function and how critical the maintenance of a precise ratio of proteins is to the [[wikt:survival|survival]] of the organism.

Diminishing the dosage of most genes produces no obvious change in [[phenotype]]. For some genes the phenotypic consequences of a decrease in gene dosage are noticeable but not catastrophic. For example, Drosophila containing only one copy of the [[wild type]] Nocth gene have visible wing abnormalities but otherwise seem to function normally. For some rare genes, the normal [[diploid]] level of [[gene expression]] is essential to individual survival; fewer than two copies of such a gene results in [[lethality]]. In [[Drosophila]], a single dose of the locus known as Triplolethal is in an otherwise diploid individual.

Although a single dose of any gene may not cause substantial harm to the individual, the genetic imbalance resulting from a single dose of many genes at the same time can be lethal. Humans, for example, cannot survive, even as [[heterozygotes]], with [[deletion (genetics)|deletion]]s that remove more than about 3% of any part of their [[haploid]] [[genome]].

[[File:Ediacaran GSSP - closeup.JPG|thumb|The 'golden spike' marking the Ediacaran GSSP]]
A '''Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point''', abbreviated '''GSSP''', is an internationally agreed upon reference point on a [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] section which defines the lower boundary of a [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] on the [[geologic time scale]].  The effort to define GSSPs is conducted by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]], a part of the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]].  Most, but not all, GSSPs are based on [[paleontology|paleontological]] changes.  Hence GSSPs are usually described in terms of transitions between different [[faunal stage]]s, though far more faunal stages have been described than GSSPs.  The GSSP definition effort commenced in 1977.  As of 2012, 64 of the 101 stages that need a GSSP have been formally defined.&lt;ref name="International Chronostratigraphic Chart 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Chronostratigraphic Chart 2012|url=http://stratigraphy.org/column.php?id=Chart/Time%20Scale|publisher=ICS|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
A geologic section has to fulfill a set of criteria to be adapted as a GSSP by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]]. The following list summarizes the criteria:&lt;ref name="Remane 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Remane|first=J.|author2=M. G. Bassett |author3=J. W. Cowie |author4=K.H. Gohrbandt |author5=H.R.

* A GSSP has to define the lower boundary of a geologic [[Stage (stratigraphy)|stage]].
* The lower boundary has to be defined using a primary marker (usually [[first appearance datum]] of a fossil species).
** There should also be secondary markers (other fossils, [[Chemostratigraphy|chemical]], [[geomagnetic reversal]]).
** The horizon in which the marker appears should have minerals that can be [[Radiometric dating|radiometrically dated]].
** The marker has to have regional and global correlation in outcrops of the same age
** The marker should be independent of [[facies]].
* The outcrop has to have an adequate thickness
* Sedimentation has to be continuous without any changes in facies
* The outcrop should be unaffected by tectonic and sedimentary movements, and metamorphism
* The outcrop has to be accessible to research and free to access.
** This includes that the outcrop has to be located where it can be visited quickly (International airport and good roads), has to be kept in good condition (Ideally a national reserve), in accessible terrain, extensive enough to allow repeated sampling and open to researchers of all nationalities.

The [[Precambrian]]-[[Cambrian]] boundary GSSP at [[Fortune Head]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] is a typical GSSP.  It is accessible by paved road and is set aside as a [[nature preserve]].  A continuous section is available from beds that are clearly Precambrian into beds that are clearly Cambrian.  The boundary is set at the first appearance of a complex trace fossil ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' that is found worldwide.  The Fortune Head GSSP is unlikely to be washed away or built over. Nonetheless, ''Treptichnus pedum'' is less than ideal as a marker fossil as it is not found in every Cambrian sequence, and it is not assured that it is found at the same level in every exposure. In fact, further eroding its value as a boundary marker, it has since been identified in strata 4m ''below'' the GSSP!&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author =    | first = J.| first2 = S.

However, no other fossil is known that would be preferable.  There is no [[radiometric dating|radiometrically datable]] bed at the boundary at Fortune Head, but there is one slightly above the boundary in similar beds nearby.
These factors have led some geologists{{who|date=March 2016}} to suggest that this GSSP is in need of reassigning.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Once a GSSP boundary has been agreed upon, a "golden spike" is driven into the geologic section to mark the precise boundary for future geologists (though in practice the "spike" need neither be golden nor an actual spike).  The first stratigraphic boundary was defined in 1977 by identifying the [[Silurian]]-[[Devonian]] boundary with a bronze plaque at a locality called [[Klonk]], northeast of the village of Suchomasty in the [[Czech Republic]].  GSSPs are also sometimes referred to as '''Golden Spikes'''.

==Global Standard Stratigraphic Ages==
{{main article|Global Standard Stratigraphic Age}}
Because defining a GSSP depends on finding well-preserved geologic sections and identifying key events, this task becomes more difficult as one goes farther back in time.  Before 630 million years ago, boundaries on the geologic timescale are defined simply by reference to fixed dates, known as "Global Standard Stratigraphic Ages".

The '''grandmother hypothesis''' is a hypothesis to explain the existence of [[menopause]] in human life history by identifying the adaptive value of extended kin networking. It builds on the previously postulated "[[Menopause#Mother hypothesis|mother hypothesis]]" which states that as mothers age, the costs of reproducing become greater, and energy devoted to those activities would be better spent helping her offspring in their reproductive efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavard|first=Samuel|last2=Metcalf|first2=C. Jessica E.|last3=Heyer|first3=Evelyne|date=5 March 2008|title=Senescence of reproduction may explain adaptive menopause in humans: A test of the "mother" hypothesis|url=|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20794|pmid=18322919|access-date=|volume=136|pages=194–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests that by redirecting their energy onto those of their offspring, grandmothers can better ensure the survival of their genes through younger generations. By providing sustenance and support to their kin, grandmothers not only ensure that their genetic interests are met, but they also enhance their social networks which could translate into better immediate resource acquisition.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Selfish Gene|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1976|isbn=0-19-286092-5|location=[[New York City]]|authorlink=Richard Dawkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=R.D.|year=1974|title=The Evolution of Social Behaviour|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=5|pages=325–83|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.05.110174.001545}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect could extend past kin into larger community networks and benefit wider [[Inclusive fitness|group fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Evolution: An Introduction to Man’s Adaptations|last=Campbell|first=B.|publisher=Aldine|year=1971|isbn=0-202-02013-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
One explanation to this was presented by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|G.C. Williams]] who was the first to posit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=GC|year=1957|title=Pleiotropy, natural selection, and the evolution of senescence|journal=Evolution|volume=11|issue=4|pages=398–411|doi=10.2307/2406060|jstor=2406060}}&lt;/ref&gt; that menopause might be an adaptation. Williams suggested that at some point it became more advantageous for women to redirect reproductive efforts into increased support of existing offspring. Since a female's dependent offspring would die as soon as she did, he argued, older mothers should stop producing new offspring and focus on those existing. In so doing, they would avoid the age-related risks associated with reproduction and thereby eliminate a potential threat to the continued survival of current offspring. The evolutionary reasoning behind this is driven by related theories.

=== Kin selection ===
{{Main|Kin selection}}
Kin selection provides the framework for an adaptive strategy by which altruistic behavior is bestowed on closely related individuals because easily identifiable markers exist to indicate them as likely to reciprocate. Kin selection is implicit in theories regarding the successful propagation of genetic material through reproduction, as helping an individual more likely to share one's genetic material would better ensure the survival of at least a portion of it. Hamilton's rule suggests that individuals preferentially help those more related to them when costs to themselves are minimal. This is modeled mathematically as :&lt;blockquote&gt;'''rb &gt; c'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;Grandmothers would, therefore, be expected to forgo their own reproduction once the benefits of helping those individuals (''b'') multiplied by the relatedness to that individual (''r'') outweighed the costs of the grandmother not reproducing (''c'').

Evidence of kin selection emerged as correlated with climate-driven changes, around 1.8 –1.7 million years ago, in female foraging and food sharing practices.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O’Connell|first=J.F.|year=1999|title=Grandmothering and the evolution of Homo erectus|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=36|issue=5|pages=461–485|doi=10.1006/jhev.1998.0285|pmid=10222165|author2=Hawkes, K.|author3=Blurton Jones, N.G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These adjustments increased juvenile dependency, forcing mothers to opt for a low-ranked, common food source ([[tuber]]s) that required adult skill to harvest and process.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Such demands constrained female IBIs thus providing an opportunity for selection to favor the grandmother hypothesis.

=== Parental investment ===
{{Main|Parental investment}}

Parental investment, originally put forth by [[Robert Trivers]], is defined as any benefit a parent confers on an offspring at a cost to its ability to invest elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Parental Investment and Sexual Selection|last=Trivers|first=Robert|publisher=Aldine Publishing Company|year=1972|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory serves to explain the dynamic sex difference in investment toward offspring observed in most species. It is evident first in gamete size, as eggs are larger and far more energetically expensive than sperm. Females are also much more sure of their genetic relationship with their offspring, as birth serves as a very reliable marker of relatedness. This paternity uncertainty that males experience makes them less likely than females to invest, since it would be costly for males to provide sustenance to another male's offspring. This translates into the grandparental generation, as grandmothers should be much more likely than grandfathers to invest in the offspring of their children, and more so in the offspring of their daughters than sons.

== The grandmother effect ==
[[Evolution|Evolutionary theory]] dictates that all organisms invest heavily in reproduction in order to replicate their genes. According to parental investment, human females will invest heavily in their young because the number of mating opportunities available to them and how many offspring they are able to produce in a given amount of time is fixed by the biology of their sex. This inter birth interval (IBI) is a limiting factor in how many children a woman can have because of the extended developmental period that human children experience. Extended childhood, like the extended post-reproductive lifespan for females, is unique to humans.&lt;ref name="Hawkesetal97222"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawkes|first=K.|year=1997|title=Hazda Women's Time Allocation, Offspring Provisioning, and the Evolution of Long Postmenopausal Life Spans|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=38|issue=4|pages=551–577|doi=10.1086/204646|author2=O’Connell, J.F.|author3=Blurton Jones, N.G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this correlation, human grandmothers are well-poised to provide supplemental parental care to their offspring's children. Since their grandchildren still carry a portion of their genes, it is still in the grandmother’s genetic interest to ensure those children survive to reproduction.

=== Reproductive senescence ===
{{Main|Evolution of aging}}
The mismatch between the rates of degradation of [[somatic cells]] versus [[gamete]]s in human females provides an unsolved paradox. Why do [[somatic cells]] decline at a slower rate and why do humans invest more in somatic [[longevity]] relative to other species?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawkes|first=K.|year=2003|title=Grandmothers and the evolution of human [[longevity]]|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|volume=15|issue=3|pages=380–400|doi=10.1002/ajhb.10156|pmid=12704714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since natural selection has a much stronger influence on younger generations, [[Mutation|deleterious mutations]] during later life become harder to select out of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Croft|first=Darren P.|last2=Brent|first2=Lauren J.N.|last3=Franks|first3=Daniel W.|last4=Cant|first4=Michael A.|date=July 2015|title=The evolution of prolonged life after reproduction|url=|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2015.04.011|pmid=|access-date=|volume=30|pages=407–416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In female [[Placentalia|placentals]], the number of ovarian [[oocytes]] is fixed during embryonic development, possibly as an adaptation to reduce the accumulation of [[mutations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On Fertile Ground: Ecology, Evolution and Human Reproduction|last=Ellison|first=P.T.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then mature or degrade over the life course. At birth there are, typically, one million [[Ovum|ova.]] However, by menopause, only approximately 400 eggs would have actually matured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=T.G.|year=1963|title=A quantitative and cytological study of germ cells in human ovaries.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences|volume=158|issue=972|pages=417–433|doi=10.1098/rspb.1963.0055}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, the rate of [[follicular atresia]] increases at older ages (around 38-40), for reasons that are not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkes|first=Kristen|last2=Smith|first2=Ken R.|date=25 August 2010|title=Do women stop early? Similarities in fertility decline in humans and chimpanzees|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05527.x|pmid=20738274|volume=1204|pages=43–53|pmc=4043631}}&lt;/ref&gt; In chimpanzees, our closest nonhuman, genetic relatives, there is a very similar rate of oocyte atresia until the age of 35 at which point humans experience a far accelerated rate compared to chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cloutier|first=Christina T.|last2=Coxworth|first2=James|last3=Hawkes|first3=Kristen|date=5 February 2015|title=Age-related decline in ovarian follicle stocks differ between champanzees (Pan troglodytes) and humans|url=|journal=AGE|doi=10.1007/s11357-015-9746-4|pmid=|access-date=|volume=37|pmc=4317403}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, chimpanzee females, unlike humans, usually die while still in their reproductive phase.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The aging process in humans leaves a dilemma in that females live past their ability to reproduce. The question poised to evolutionary researchers then becomes, why do human bodies live on so robustly and for so long past their reproductive potential, and could there be an adaptive benefit to abandoning one's own attempts at reproduction to assist kin?

=== Alloparenting ===
The practice of dividing parenting responsibilities among non-parents affords females a great advantage in that they can dedicate more effort and energy toward having an increased number of offspring. While this practice is observed in several species,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leggett|first=Helen C.|last2=El Mouden|first2=Claire E|last3=Wild|first3=Geoff|last4=West|first4=Stuart|date=12 October 2011|title=Promiscuity and the evolution of cooperative breeding|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.1627|pmid=|access-date=|volume=279|pages=1405–1411|pmc=3282361}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been an especially successful strategy for humans who rely extensively on social networks. One observational study of the Aka foragers of Central Africa demonstrated how allomaternal investment toward an offspring increased specifically during times that the mother's investment in subsistence and economic activities increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meehan|first=Courtney|date=16 September 2009|title=Maternal Time Allocation in Two Cooperative Childrearing Societies|url=|journal=Human Nature|volume=20|issue=4|pages=375–393|doi=10.1007/s12110-009-9076-2|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the grandmother effect were true, post-menopausal women should continue to work after the cessation of fertility and use the proceeds to preferentially provision their kin. Studies of [[Hadza people|Hadza]] women have provided such evidence. A modern hunter-gatherer group in Tanzania, the post-menopausal Hadza women often help their grandchildren by foraging for food staples that younger children are inefficient at acquiring successfully.&lt;ref name="Hawkesetal97222" /&gt; Children, therefore, require the assistance of an adult to gain this crucial version of sustenance. Often, however, mothers are inhibited by the care of younger offspring and are less available to help their older children forage.&lt;ref name="Hawkesetal97222" /&gt; In this regard, the Hadza grandmothers become vital to the care of existing grandchildren, and allow reproductive-age women to redirect energy from existing offspring into younger offspring or other reproductive efforts.

However, some commentators felt that the role of Hadza men, who contribute 96% of the mean daily intake of protein, was ignored;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gurven|first=M.|year=1997|title=Comments on 'Hazda Women's Time Allocation, Offspring Provisioning, and the Evolution of Long Postmenopausal Life Spans'|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=38|issue=4|pages=566–567|doi=10.1086/204646|author2=Hill, K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the authors have addressed this criticism in numerous publications.&lt;ref name="Hawkesetal97222" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawkes|first=K.|year=2001|title=Hadza Meat Sharing|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=22|issue=2|pages=113–142|doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(00)00066-0|pmid=11282309|author2=O'Connell, J.F.|author3=Blurton Jones N.G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawkes|first=K.|year=2001|title=Hunting and nuclear families: some lessons from the Hadza about men's work|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=42|issue=5|pages=681–709|doi=10.1086/322559|author2=O'Connell, J.F.|author3=Blurton Jones N.G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawkes|first=K.|year=2010|title=Provisioning is not the only reason men hunt|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=51|issue=2|pages=259–264|doi=10.1086/651074|author2=O'Connell, J.F.|author3=Coxworth, J.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies also demonstrated reservations about behavioral similarities between the Hadza and our ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibbons|first=A.|year=1997|title=Why Life After Menopause?|journal=Science|volume=276|issue=5312|page=535|doi=10.1126/science.276.5312.535b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maternal v. paternal grandmothers ===
Because grandmothers should be expected to provide preferential treatment to offspring she is most certain of her relationship to, there should be differences in the help she provides to each grandchild according to that relationship. Studies have found that not only does the maternal or paternal relationship of the grandparent affect whether or how much help a grandchild receives, but also what kind of help. Paternal grandmothers often had a detrimental effect on infant mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voland|first=E.|year=2002|title=Opposite Effects of Maternal and Paternal Grandmothers on Infant Survival in Historical Krummörn|journal=Mpidr Wp 2001-026|author2=Beise, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jamison|first=C.S.|year=2002|title=Are all grandmothers equal?

Equally, a grandmother could be both a maternal and paternal grandmother and thus in division of resources, a daughter’s offspring should be favored.

Other studies have focused on the genetic relationship between grandmothers and grandchildren.  Such studies have found that the effects of maternal / paternal grandmothers on grandsons / granddaughters may vary based on degree of genetic relatedness, with paternal grandmothers having positive effects on granddaughters but detrimental effects on grandsons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=M|year=2010|title=Grandma plays favourites: X-chromosome relatedness and sex-specific childhood mortality|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|volume=277|issue=1681|pages=567–573|doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.1660|pmc=2842695|pmid=19864288|author2=Sear R|author3=Beise J|author4=Ragsdale G|author5=Voland E|author6=Knapp LA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and paternity uncertainty may be less important than chromosome inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=M|year=2011|title=The Selfish Grandma Gene: The Roles of the X-Chromosome and Paternity Uncertainty in the Evolution of Grandmothering Behavior and Longevity|journal=International journal of evolutionary biology|volume=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.4061/2011/165919|author2=Johow J|author3=Knapp LA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms and alternative hypotheses ==
Some critics have cast doubt on the hypothesis because while it addresses how grandparental care could have maintained longer female post-reproductive lifespans, it does not provide an explanation for how it would have evolved in the first place. Some versions of the grandmother hypothesis asserted that it helped explain the longevity of human [[senescence]]. However, demographic data has shown that historically rising numbers in older people among the population correlated with lower numbers of younger people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkes|first=Kristen|date=11 March 2004|title=Human longevity: The grandmother effect|url=|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/428128a|pmid=15014476|access-date=|volume=428|pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that at some point grandmothers were not helpful toward the survival of their grandchildren, and does not explain why the first grandmother would forgo her own reproduction to help her offspring and grandchildren.

In addition, all variations on the mother, or grandmother effect, fail to explain [[longevity]] with continued [[spermatogenesis]] in males.

Another problem concerning the grandmother hypothesis is that it requires a history of female [[philopatry]]. Though some studies suggest that hunter-gatherer societies are [[patriarchal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peccei|first=J. S.|year=2001|title=A critique of the grandmother hypotheses: Old and new|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|volume=13|issue=4|pages=434–452|doi=10.1002/ajhb.1076|pmid=11400215}}&lt;/ref&gt; mounting evidence shows that residence is fluid among hunter-gatherers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kinship and Behavior in Primates|last=Alvarez|first=H.|publisher=Oxford University|year=2004|location=Oxford|pages=420–442|chapter=Residence groups among hunter-gatherers: A view of the claims and evidence for patrilocal bands|editor=Chapais, B. |editor2=Berman, C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marlowe|first=F|year=2004|title=Marital residence among foragers|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=45|issue=2|pages=277–284|doi=10.1086/382256|jstor=10.1086/382256}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that married women in at least one patrilineal society visit their kin during times when kin-based support can be especially beneficial to a woman's [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scelza|first=B.|year=2011|title=Female Mobility and Postmarital Kin Access in a Patrilocal Society|journal=Human Nature|volume=22|issue=4|pages=377–393|doi=10.1007/s12110-011-9125-5|pmid=22388944}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study does suggest, however, that maternal kin were essential to the fitness of sons as fathers in a patrilocal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strier|first=Karen B.|authorlink=Karen B.

It also fails to explain the detrimental effects of losing ovarian follicular activity. While continued post-menopausal synthesis of estrogen occurs in peripheral tissues through the adrenal pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Labrie|first=F.|date=2010|title=DHEA, important source of sex steroids in men and even more in women|url=|journal=Neuroendocrinology: Pathological Situations And Diseases|volume=182|pages=97–148|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(10)82004-7|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; these women undoubtedly face an increased risk of conditions associated with lower levels of estrogen: [[osteoporosis]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[coronary artery disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Massart|first=F.|year=2001|title=Genetics of Menopause-Associatred Diseases|journal=Maturitas|volume=40|issue=2|pages=103–116|doi=10.1016/S0378-5122(01)00283-3|pmid=11716989|author2=Reginster, J.Y.|author3=Brandi, M.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the debilitating symptoms that usually accompany menopause in Western cultures could be seen as a natural cull of non-reproductive members of a species. Hot flashes, loss of short term memory, decreased ability to concentrate and difficulty in the learning of new tasks would, in the wild, leave the sufferer at greater risk from predators and topographical dangers such as falls from a height. This natural cull would leave more food, usually in relatively short supply, for the reproductive members of a species whose youth are less experienced at finding it.

However, cross-cultural studies of menopause have found that menopausal symptoms are quite variable among different populations, and that some populations of females do not recognize, and may not even experience, these "symptoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melby|first=Melissa K.|year=2005|title=Vasomotor symptom prevalence and language of menopause in Japan|journal=Menopause|volume=12|issue=3|pages=250–257|doi=10.1097/01.GME.0000146108.27840.D9|pmid=15879913}}&lt;/ref&gt; This high level of variability in menopausal symptoms across populations brings into question the plausibility of menopause as a sort of "[[culling]] agent" to eliminate non-reproductive females from competition with younger, fertile members of the species. This also faces the task of explaining the paradox between the typical age for menopause onset and the life expectancy of female humans.

In [[general relativity]], a point mass deflects a light ray with [[impact parameter]] &lt;math&gt;b~&lt;/math&gt; by an angle approximately equal to

&lt;math&gt;\hat{\alpha} = \frac{4GM}{c^2b}&lt;/math&gt;

where G is the [[gravitational constant]], M the mass of the deflecting object  and c the [[speed of light]]. A naive application of [[Newtonian gravity]] can yield exactly half this value, where the light ray is assumed as a massed particle and scattered by the gravitational potential well.  This approximation is good when &lt;math&gt;4GM/c^2b&lt;/math&gt; is small.

In situations where general relativity can be approximated by [[linearized gravity]], the deflection due to a spatially extended mass can be written simply as a vector sum over point masses.  In the [[continuum limit]], this becomes an integral over the density &lt;math&gt;\rho~&lt;/math&gt;, and if the deflection is small we can approximate the gravitational potential along the deflected trajectory by the potential along the undeflected trajectory, as in the [[Born approximation]] in quantum mechanics. The deflection is then

&lt;math&gt;\vec{\hat{\alpha}}(\vec{\xi})=\frac{4 G}{c^2} \int d^2\xi^{\prime} \int dz \rho(\vec{\xi}^{\prime},z)  \frac{\vec{b}}{|\vec{b}|^2}, ~ \vec{b} \equiv \vec{\xi}  - \vec{\xi^{\prime}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the line-of-sight coordinate, and &lt;math&gt; \vec{b} &lt;/math&gt; is the vector impact parameter of the actual ray path from the infinitesimal mass &lt;math&gt;  d^2\xi^{\prime}  dz\rho(\vec{\xi}^{\prime},z) &lt;/math&gt; located at the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\vec{\xi}^{\prime}, z)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Bartelmann| first = M. |author2=Schneider, P. |date=January 2001 | title=Weak Gravitational Lensing| journal = Physics Reports | volume=340 | issue = 4–5 |pages = 291–472 | bibcode = 2001PhR...340..291B | doi = 10.1016/S0370-1573(00)00082-X|arxiv = astro-ph/9912508 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thin lens approximation ==

In the limit of a "thin lens", where the distances between the source, lens, and observer are much larger than the size of the lens (this is almost always true for astronomical objects), we can define the projected mass density

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma(\vec{\xi})=\int \rho(\vec{\xi},z) dz &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec{\xi}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector in the plane of the sky.  The deflection angle is then

&lt;math&gt;\vec{\hat{\alpha}}= 
\frac{4 G}{c^2} \int \frac{(\vec{\xi}-\vec{\xi}^{\prime})\Sigma(\vec{\xi}^{\prime})}{|\vec{\xi}-\vec{\xi}^{\prime}|^2}d^2 \xi^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Gravitational-lensing-angles.png|right|frame|Angles involved in a thin gravitational lens system.]]

As shown in the diagram on the right, the difference between the unlensed angular position &lt;math&gt;\vec{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; and the observed position &lt;math&gt;\vec{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is this deflection angle, reduced by a ratio of distances, described as the lens equation

&lt;math&gt;\vec{\beta}=\vec{\theta}-\vec{\alpha}(\vec{\theta}) = \vec{\theta} - \frac{D_{ds}}{D_s} \vec{\hat{\alpha}}(\vec{D_d\theta})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D_{ds}~&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the lens to the source &lt;math&gt;D_s~&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the observer to the source, and &lt;math&gt;D_d~&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the observer to the lens.  For extragalactic lenses, these must be [[angular diameter distance]]s.

In strong gravitational lensing, this equation can have multiple solutions, because a single source at &lt;math&gt;\vec{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; can be lensed into multiple images.

=== Convergence and deflection potential ===

It is convenient to define the ''convergence''

&lt;math&gt;
\kappa(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{\Sigma(D_d\vec{\theta})}{\Sigma_{cr}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the ''critical surface density'' (not to be confused with the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of the universe)

&lt;math&gt;
\Sigma_{cr} = \frac{c^2 D_s}{4\pi G D_{ds}D_d}
&lt;/math&gt;

The reduced deflection angle &lt;math&gt;\vec{\alpha}(\vec{\theta})&lt;/math&gt; can now be written as

&lt;math&gt;
\vec{\alpha}(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int d^2 \theta^{\prime} \frac{(\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}^{\prime})\kappa(\vec{\theta}^{\prime})}{|\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}^{\prime}|^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

We can also define the ''deflection potential''

&lt;math&gt;
\psi(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int d^2 \theta^{\prime} \kappa(\vec{\theta}^{\prime}) \ln |\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}^{\prime}|
&lt;/math&gt;

such that the scaled deflection angle is just the [[gradient]] of the potential and the convergence is half the [[Laplacian]] of the potential:

&lt;math&gt;
\vec{\alpha}(\vec{\theta}) = \vec{\nabla} \psi(\vec{\theta})
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\kappa(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 \psi(\vec{\theta})
&lt;/math&gt;

The deflection potential can also be written as a scaled projection of the Newtonian gravitational potential &lt;math&gt;\Phi~&lt;/math&gt; of the lens&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite arxiv | last = Narayan| first = R. | last2 = Bartelmann |first2=M. |date=June 1996 | title=Lectures on Gravitational Lensing |arxiv = astro-ph/9606001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\psi(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{2 D_{ds}}{D_d D_s c^2} \int \Phi(D_d\vec{\theta},z) dz
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Lensing Jacobian ===

The [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] between the unlensed and lensed coordinate systems is

&lt;math&gt;A_{ij}=\frac{\partial \beta_i}{\partial \theta_j}=\delta_{ij} - \frac{\partial \alpha_i}{\partial \theta_j}
= \delta_{ij} - \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}~&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]].  Because the matrix of second derivatives must be symmetric, the Jacobian can be decomposed into a diagonal term involving the convergence and a [[matrix trace|trace]]-free term involving the ''shear'' &lt;math&gt;\gamma~&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A=(1-\kappa)\left[\begin{array}{ c c } 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{array}\right]-\gamma\left[\begin{array}{ c c } \cos 2\phi &amp; \sin 2\phi \\ \sin 2\phi &amp; -\cos 2\phi \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi~&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between &lt;math&gt;\vec{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; and the x-axis.  The term involving the convergence magnifies the image by increasing its size while conserving surface brightness.  The term involving the shear stretches the image [[tangent]]ially around the lens, as discussed in [[#Weak lensing observables|weak lensing observables]].

The shear defined here is ''not'' equivalent to the [[shear mapping|shear]] traditionally defined in mathematics, though both stretch an image non-uniformly.

[[Image:shear-components.svg|right|thumb|300px|Effect of the components of convergence and shear on a circular source represented by the solid green circle. The complex shear notation is defined [[#Shear and reduced shear|below]].]]

=== Fermat surface ===

There is an alternative way of deriving the lens equation, starting from the photon arrival time (Fermat surface) 	

&lt;math&gt;
t =  \int_{0}^{z_s}   { n dz \over c \cos \alpha(z) } 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; dz/c &lt;/math&gt; is the time to travel an infinitesimal line element along the source-observer straight line in vacuum, which is 
then corrected by the factor

&lt;math&gt;
1/\cos(\alpha(z))  \approx 1 + {\alpha(z)^2 \over 2}
&lt;/math&gt;

to get the line element along the bended path &lt;math&gt; dl = {dz \over c \cos \alpha(z) } &lt;/math&gt;  with a varying small pitch angle &lt;math&gt; \alpha(z), &lt;/math&gt; and the refraction index  
{{math|''n''}} for the "aether", i.e., the gravitational field.  The last can be obtained from the fact that a photon travels on a null geodesic of a weakly perturbed static Minkowski universe

&lt;math&gt;
ds^2 = 0  = c^2 dt^2 \left(1 + {2 \Phi \over c^2} \right) -  \left(1 + {2 \Phi \over c^2} \right)^{-1} dl^2
&lt;/math&gt;
 
where  the uneven gravitational potential &lt;math&gt; \Phi \ll c^2 &lt;/math&gt; drives a changing the speed of light

&lt;math&gt;
c' = {dl/dt} = \left(1 + {2 \Phi \over c^2} \right)  c.
&lt;/math&gt;

So the refraction index
 
&lt;math&gt;
 n \equiv {c \over c'} \approx  \left(1 -  {2 \Phi \over c^2} \right). 
&lt;/math&gt;

The refraction index greater than unity because of the negative gravitational potential &lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt;.

Put these together and keep the leading terms we have the time arrival surface

&lt;math&gt; 
t \approx \int_0^{z_s} {dz \over c}  +  \int_0^{z_s} {dz \over c} {\alpha(z)^2 \over 2} -  \int_0^{z_s} {dz \over c} {2 \Phi \over c^2} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is the straight path travel time, the second term is the extra geometric path, and the third is the gravitational delay. 
Make the triangle approximation that &lt;math&gt; \alpha(z) = \theta - \beta &lt;/math&gt; for the path between the observer and the lens, 
and &lt;math&gt; \alpha(z) \approx (\theta - \beta) {D_d \over D_{ds}} &lt;/math&gt; for the path between the lens and the source.  
The geometric delay term becomes

&lt;math&gt;
    {D_d \over c}   { (\vec{\theta} - \vec{\beta})^2 \over 2} 
+ {D_{ds} \over c}  { \left[ (\vec{\theta} - \vec{\beta} )  {D_d \over D_{ds}} \right]^2 \over 2}
= {D_d D_s \over D_{ds} }    { ( \vec{\theta} - \vec{\beta} )^2 \over 2} .
&lt;/math&gt;
(How? There is no D_s on the left. Angular diameter distances don't add in a simple way, in general.)
So the Fermat surface becomes

&lt;math&gt;
 t = constant + {D_d D_s \over D_{ds} c} \tau, ~ \tau \equiv \left[  { (\vec{\theta}-\vec{\beta})^2 \over 2} -  \psi \right] 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; is so-called dimensionless time delay, and the 2D lensing potential

&lt;math&gt;
\psi(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{2 D_{ds}}{D_d D_s c^2} \int \Phi(D_d\vec{\theta},z) dz.
&lt;/math&gt;
 
The images lie at the extrema of this surface, so the variation of t with &lt;math&gt; \vec{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;  is zero,

&lt;math&gt;
0 = \nabla_{\vec{\theta}} \tau  =  \vec{\theta} - \vec{\beta}  - \nabla_{\vec{\theta}} \psi(\vec{\theta}) 
&lt;/math&gt;

which is the lens equation.  Take the Poisson's equation for 3D potential 
&lt;math&gt;
\Phi(\vec{\xi})  = - \int  \frac{d^3\xi^{\prime} \rho(\vec{\xi}^{\prime})}{|\vec{\xi}-\vec{\xi}^{\prime}|} 
&lt;/math&gt;

and we find the 2D lensing potential

&lt;math&gt;\psi(\vec{\theta})   = - \frac{2 G D_{ds}}{D_d D_s c^2}   \int dz  \int  \frac{d^3\xi^{\prime} \rho(\vec{\xi}^{\prime})}{|\vec{\xi}-\vec{\xi}^{\prime}|}
 =  -  \sum_i \frac{2 G M_i D_{is} }{D_s D_i c^2}   \left[  \sinh^{-1}  { |z -D_i| \over D_i |\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}_i |  }  \right ] |_{D_i}^{D_s}  + |_{D_i}^{0} .
&lt;/math&gt;

Here we assumed the lens is a collection of point masses &lt;math&gt; M_i &lt;/math&gt; at angular coordinates &lt;math&gt; \vec{\theta}_i &lt;/math&gt; and distances &lt;math&gt; z=D_i .&lt;/math&gt;  
Use &lt;math&gt; \sinh^{-1} 1/x = \ln(1/x + \sqrt{1/x^2+1}) \approx -\ln(x/2) &lt;/math&gt; for very small {{math|''x''}} we find

&lt;math&gt;
\psi(\vec{\theta})   \approx   \sum_i  \frac{2 GM_i D_{is} }{D_s D_i c^2}   \left[   \ln\left( { |\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}_i |^2 \over 4}  { D_i \over D_{is} } \right)     \right]. 
&lt;/math&gt;

One can  compute the ''convergence'' by applying the 2D Laplacian of the 2D lensing potential

&lt;math&gt;
\kappa(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{1}{2} \nabla_{\vec{\theta}}^2 \psi(\vec{\theta}) =  \frac{4\pi G D_{ds}D_d} {c^2 D_s} \int dz \rho( D_d \vec{\theta},z) 
== {\Sigma \over \Sigma_{cr} } == \sum_i { 4\pi G M_i D_{is} \over c^2 D_i D_s}  \delta(\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}_i)
&lt;/math&gt;

in agreement with earlier definition &lt;math&gt; \kappa(\vec{\theta}) =  {\Sigma \over \Sigma_{cr} }&lt;/math&gt; as the ratio of projected density with the critical density.  
Here we used &lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 1/r = - 4 \pi \delta(r) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;  \nabla_{\vec{\theta}} = D_d \nabla. &lt;/math&gt;

We can also confirm the previously defined reduced deflection angle

&lt;math&gt;
\vec{\theta} -\vec{\beta}   =  \nabla_{\vec{\theta}} \psi(\vec{\theta}) =  \sum_i   {  \theta_{Ei}^2  \over |\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}_i |} , ~ 
\pi \theta_{Ei}^2 \equiv  {4 \pi GM_i D_{is}  \over c^2 D_s  D_i } 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \theta_{Ei} &lt;/math&gt; is the so-called Einstein angular radius of a point lens Mi.   For a single point lens at the origin we recover the standard result 
that there will be two images at the two solutions of the essentially quadratic equation

&lt;math&gt; \vec{\theta} -\vec{\beta}   =   {\theta_{E}^2  \over |\vec{\theta} |}.  &lt;/math&gt;

The amplification matrix can be obtained by double derivatives of the dimensionless time delay

&lt;math&gt;
A_{ij} = {\partial \beta_j \over \partial \theta_i} = {\partial \tau \over \partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j } = \delta_{ij} -  {\partial \psi \over \partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j } 
= \left[\begin{array}{ c c } 1-\kappa -\gamma_1 &amp; \gamma_2 \\ \gamma_2 &amp; 1-\kappa +\gamma_1 \end{array}\right]  &lt;/math&gt;

where we have define the derivatives

&lt;math&gt; \kappa = {\partial \psi \over 2 \partial \theta_1 \partial \theta_1 } +  {\partial \psi \over 2\partial \theta_2 \partial \theta_2 } , 
~ \gamma_1 \equiv  {\partial \psi \over 2 \partial \theta_1 \partial \theta_1 } -  {\partial \psi \over 2\partial \theta_2 \partial \theta_2 } ,   
~ \gamma_2 \equiv  {\partial \psi \over \partial \theta_1 \partial \theta_2 }    &lt;/math&gt;

which takes the meaning of convergence and shear.   The amplification is the inverse of the Jacobian

&lt;math&gt;   A = 1/det(A_{ij}) = {1 \over (1-\kappa)^2 -\gamma_1^2 -\gamma_2^2}  &lt;/math&gt;

where a positive A means either a maxima or a minima, and a negative A means a saddle point in the arrival surface.

For a single point lens, one can show (albeit a lengthy calculation) that

&lt;math&gt; \kappa =0, ~ \gamma = \sqrt{\gamma_1^2 + \gamma_2^2} = {\theta_E^2 \over |\theta|^2}, ~ \theta_E^2= {4GM D_{ds} \over c^2 D_dD_s}.
&lt;/math&gt;

So the amplification of a point lens is given by

&lt;math&gt;
A = \left( 1 - {\theta_E^4 \over \theta^4} \right)^{-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Note A diverges for images at the Einstein radius &lt;math&gt; \theta_E. &lt;/math&gt;

In cases there are multiple point lenses plus a smooth background of (dark) particles of surface density &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{\rm cr} \kappa_{\rm smooth}, &lt;/math&gt; the time arrival surface is

&lt;math&gt;
\psi(\vec{\theta})   \approx   {1 \over 2} \kappa_{\rm smooth} |\theta|^2 +  \sum_i  \theta_E^2  \left[   \ln\left( { |\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}_i |^2 \over 4}  { D_d \over D_{ds} } \right)     \right]. 
&lt;/math&gt;

To compute the amplification, e.g., at the origin (0,0), due to identical point masses distributed at &lt;math&gt;  (\theta_{xi},\theta_{yi} ) &lt;/math&gt; 
we have to add up the total shear, and include a convergence of the smooth background, 
&lt;math&gt;
A = \left[ (1 - \kappa_{\rm smooth})^2  
                  - \left( \sum_i {  (\theta_{xi}^2 - \theta_{yi}^2 ) \theta_E^2 \over (\theta_{xi}^2 + \theta_{yi}^2)^2 }\right) ^2  
                  - \left( \sum_i {  (2 \theta_{xi} \theta_{yi}) \theta_E^2 \over (\theta_{xi}^2 + \theta_{yi}^2)^2 }  \right)^2   \right] ^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

This generally creates a network of critical curves, lines connecting image points of infinite amplification.

== General weak lensing ==

In [[Weak gravitational lensing#Cosmic shear|weak lensing by large-scale structure]], the thin-lens approximation may break down, and low-density extended structures may not be well approximated by multiple thin-lens planes.  In this case, the deflection can be derived by instead assuming that the gravitational potential is slowly varying everywhere (for this reason, this approximation is not valid for strong lensing).
This approach assumes the universe is well described by a Newtonian-perturbed [[FRW metric]], but it makes no other assumptions about the distribution of the lensing mass.

As in the thin-lens case, the effect can be written as a mapping from the unlensed angular position &lt;math&gt;\vec{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; to the lensed position &lt;math&gt;\vec{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of the transform can be written as an integral over the gravitational potential &lt;math&gt;\Phi~&lt;/math&gt; along the line of sight
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Cosmology|last=Dodelson|first=Scott|date=2003|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0-12-219141-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \beta_i}{\partial \theta_j} = \delta_{ij} + \int_0^{r_\infty} dr 
  g(r) \frac{\partial^2  \Phi(\vec{x}(r))}{\partial x^i
    \partial x^j}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r~&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]], &lt;math&gt;x^i~&lt;/math&gt; are the transverse distances, and

&lt;math&gt;
g(r) = 2 r \int^{r_\infty}_r dr'
    \left(1-\frac{r^\prime}{r}\right)W(r^\prime)
&lt;/math&gt;

is the ''lensing kernel'', which defines the efficiency of lensing for a distribution of sources &lt;math&gt;W(r)~&lt;/math&gt;.

The Jacobian &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}~&lt;/math&gt; can be decomposed into convergence and shear terms just as with the thin-lens case, and in the limit of a lens that is both thin and weak, their physical interpretations are the same.

== Weak lensing observables ==

In [[weak gravitational lensing]], the [[Gravitational Lensing Formalism#Lensing Jacobian|Jacobian]] is mapped out by observing the effect of the shear on the ellipticities of background galaxies.  This effect is purely statistical; the shape of any galaxy will be dominated by its random, unlensed shape, but lensing will produce a spatially coherent distortion of these shapes.

=== Measures of ellipticity ===

In most fields of astronomy, the ellipticity is defined as &lt;math&gt;1-q~&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q=\frac{b}{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the axis ratio of the [[ellipse]].  In [[weak gravitational lensing]], two different definitions are commonly used, and both are complex quantities which specify both the axis ratio and the position angle &lt;math&gt;\phi~&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
\chi = \frac{1-q^2}{1+q^2}e^{2i\phi} = \frac{a^2-b^2}{a^2+b^2}e^{2i\phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon = \frac{1-q}{1+q}e^{2i\phi} = \frac{a-b}{a+b}e^{2i\phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

Like the traditional ellipticity, the magnitudes of both of these quantities range from 0 (circular) to 1 (a line segment).  The position angle is encoded in the complex phase, but because of the factor of 2 in the trigonometric arguments, ellipticity is invariant under a rotation of 180 degrees.  This is to be expected; an ellipse is unchanged by a 180° rotation.  Taken as imaginary and real parts, the real part of the complex ellipticity describes the elongation along the coordinate axes, while the imaginary part describes the elongation at 45° from the axes.

The ellipticity is often written as a two-component vector instead of a complex number, though it is not a true [[Coordinate vector|vector]] with regard to transforms:

&lt;math&gt;
\chi = \{\left|\chi\right|\cos 2\phi, \left|\chi\right|\sin 2\phi\}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon = \{\left|\epsilon\right|\cos 2\phi, \left|\epsilon\right| \sin 2\phi\}
&lt;/math&gt;

Real astronomical background sources are not perfect ellipses.  Their ellipticities can be measured by finding a best-fit elliptical model to the data, or by measuring the second moments of the image about some [[centroid]] &lt;math&gt;(\bar{x},\bar{y})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xx} = \frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})^2 I(x,y)}{\sum I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{yy} = \frac{\sum (y-\bar{y})^2 I(x,y)}{\sum I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xy} = \frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}{\sum I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

The complex ellipticities are then

&lt;math&gt;
\chi = \frac{q_{xx}-q_{yy} + 2 i q_{xy}}{q_{xx}+q_{yy}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon = \frac{q_{xx}-q_{yy} + 2 i q_{xy}}{q_{xx}+q_{yy} + 2\sqrt{q_{xx}q_{yy}-q_{xy}^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

This can be used to relate the second moments to traditional ellipse parameters:

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xx} = a^2 \cos^2 \theta + b^2 \sin^2 \theta\,
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{yy} = a^2 \sin^2 \theta + b^2 \cos^2 \theta\,
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xy} = (a^2-b^2)\sin \theta \cos \theta\,
&lt;/math&gt;

and in reverse:

&lt;math&gt;
a^2 = \frac{q_{xx}+q_{yy} + \sqrt{(q_{xx}-q_{yy})^2 + 4q_{xy}^2}}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
b^2 = \frac{q_{xx}+q_{yy} - \sqrt{(q_{xx}-q_{yy})^2 + 4q_{xy}^2}}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\tan 2\theta = \frac{2q_{xy}}{q_{xx}-q_{yy}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The unweighted second moments above are problematic in the presence of noise, neighboring objects, or extended galaxy profiles, so it is typical to use [[apodization|apodized]] moments instead:

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xx} = \frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})^2 w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}{\sum w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{yy} = \frac{\sum (y-\bar{y})^2 w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}{\sum w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xy} = \frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y}) w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}{\sum w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;w(x,y)~&lt;/math&gt; is a weight function that typically goes to zero or quickly approaches zero at some finite radius.

Image moments cannot generally be used to measure the ellipticity of galaxies without correcting for [[Weak gravitational lensing#Methodology|observational effects]], particularly the [[point spread function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Bernstein| first = G. |author2=Jarvis, M. |date=February 2002 | title=Shapes and Shears, Stars and Smears: Optimal Measurements for Weak Lensing| journal = Astronomical Journal | volume=123 | issue = 2 |pages = 583–618 | bibcode = 2002AJ....123..583B | doi = 10.1086/338085|arxiv = astro-ph/0107431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shear and reduced shear ===

Recall that the [[Gravitational Lensing Formalism#Lensing Jacobian|lensing Jacobian]] can be decomposed into shear &lt;math&gt;\gamma~&lt;/math&gt; and convergence &lt;math&gt;\kappa~&lt;/math&gt;.
Acting on a circular background source with radius &lt;math&gt;R~&lt;/math&gt;, lensing generates an ellipse with major and minor axes

&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{R}{1-\kappa-\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{R}{1-\kappa+\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

as long as the shear and convergence do not change appreciably over the size of the source (in that case, the lensed image is not an ellipse).  Galaxies are not intrinsically circular, however, so it is necessary to quantify the effect of lensing on a non-zero ellipticity.

We can define the ''complex shear'' in analogy to the complex ellipticities defined above

&lt;math&gt;
\gamma = \left|\gamma\right| e^{2i\phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

as well as the ''reduced shear''

&lt;math&gt;
g \equiv \frac{\gamma}{1-\kappa}
&lt;/math&gt;

The lensing Jacobian can now be written as

&lt;math&gt;
A=\left[\begin{array}{ c c } 1 - \kappa - \mathrm{Re}[\gamma] &amp; -\mathrm{Im}[\gamma] \\ -\mathrm{Im}[\gamma] &amp; 1 -\kappa + \mathrm{Re}[\gamma]\end{array}\right]
=(1-\kappa)\left[\begin{array}{ c c } 1-\mathrm{Re}[g] &amp; -\mathrm{Im}[g] \\ -\mathrm{Im}[g] &amp; 1+ \mathrm{Re}[g]\end{array}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

For a reduced shear &lt;math&gt;g~&lt;/math&gt; and unlensed complex ellipticities &lt;math&gt;\chi_s~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_s~&lt;/math&gt;, the lensed ellipticities are

&lt;math&gt;
\chi = \frac{\chi_s+2g+g^2\chi_s^*}{1+|g|^2 + 2\mathrm{Re}(g\chi_s^*)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon = \frac{\epsilon_s+g}{1+g^*\epsilon_s}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the weak lensing limit, &lt;math&gt;\gamma \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\kappa \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;, so

&lt;math&gt;
\chi \approx \chi_s+2g \approx \chi_s+2\gamma
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon \approx \epsilon_s+g \approx \epsilon_s+\gamma
&lt;/math&gt;

If we can assume that the sources are randomly oriented, their complex ellipticities average to zero, so
&lt;math&gt; \langle \chi \rangle = 2\langle \gamma \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle \epsilon \rangle = \langle \gamma \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.
This is the principal equation of weak lensing: the average ellipticity of background galaxies is a direct measure of the shear induced by foreground mass.

=== Magnification ===

While gravitational lensing preserves surface brightness, as dictated by [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]], lensing does change the apparent [[solid angle]] of a source. The amount of [[magnification]] is given by the ratio of the image area to the source area. For a circularly [[symmetry|symmetric]] lens, the magnification factor μ is given by

&lt;math&gt;
\mu = \frac{\theta}{\beta} \frac{d\theta}{d\beta}
&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of convergence and shear

&lt;math&gt;
\mu = \frac{1}{\det A} = \frac{1}{[(1-\kappa)^2-\gamma^2]}
&lt;/math&gt;

For this reason, the Jacobian &lt;math&gt;A~&lt;/math&gt; is also known as the "inverse magnification matrix".

The reduced shear is invariant with the scaling of the Jacobian &lt;math&gt;A~&lt;/math&gt; by a scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda~&lt;/math&gt;, which is equivalent to the transformations
&lt;math&gt;
1-\kappa^{\prime} = \lambda(1-\kappa)
&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;
\gamma^{\prime} = \lambda \gamma
&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; can only be determined up to a transformation &lt;math&gt;\kappa \rightarrow \lambda \kappa+(1-\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, which is known as the "mass sheet degeneracy." In principle, this degeneracy can be broken if an independent measurement of the magnification is available because the magnification is not invariant under the aforementioned degeneracy transformation. Specifically, &lt;math&gt;\mu~&lt;/math&gt; scales with &lt;math&gt;\lambda~&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\mu \propto \lambda^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Contemporary typographers view typography as a craft with a very long [[history]] tracing its origins back to the first punches and dies used to make [[Seal (device)|seal]]s and [[currency]] in [[Ancient history|ancient times]]. The basic elements of typography are at least as old as [[civilization]] and the earliest [[writing system]]s&amp;mdash;a series of key developments that were eventually drawn together into one, systematic craft.

__TOC__

==Medieval design roots==
[[File:Gutenberg bible Old Testament Epistle of St Jerome.jpg|thumb|top|200px|First page of the first volume of the [[Gutenberg Bible]], printed with an early [[textualis|textur]] typeface c. 1455. In this copy the [[decorative]] colored initials were [[calligraphy|hand-lettered]] separately by a scribe.]]

Typography, type-founding and typeface design began as closely related crafts in mid-15th-century Europe with the introduction of [[movable type]] [[Printing press|printing]] at the junction of the medieval era and the [[Renaissance]]. Handwritten letterforms of the mid-15th century embodied 3000&amp;nbsp;years of evolved letter design, and were the natural models for letterforms in systematized typography. The scribal letter known as ''[[textualis|textur]]'' or ''textualis'', produced by the strong [[Gothic art|gothic]] spirit of [[blackletter]] from the hands of German area scribes, served as the model for the first text types.

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] employed the [[scribe]] [[Peter Schöffer]] to help design and cut the letterpunches for the first typeface&amp;mdash;the [[D-K type]] of 202 characters used to print the first printed books in Europe. A second typeface of about 300 characters designed for the [[Gutenberg Bible|42-line Bible]] c. 1455 was probably cut by the goldsmith Hans Dunne with the help of two others&amp;mdash;Götz von Shlettstadt and [[Hans von Speyer]].

Cultural tradition ensured that German typography and type design remained true to the gothic/blackletter spirit; but the parallel influence of the humanist and neo-classical typography in Italy (the second country where movable type printing was done) catalyzed textur into four additional sub-styles that were distinct, structurally rich and highly disciplined: [[Bastarda]], [[Fraktur (typeface sub-classification)|fraktur]], [[Rotunda (script)|rotunda]], and [[Schwabacher]].

The rapid spread of movable type printing across Europe produced additional Gothic, half-Gothic and Gothic-to-Roman transitional types. [[Johann Bämler]]'s Schwabacher, [[Augsburg (typeface)|Augsburg]] appeared in 1474. The half-Gothic Rotunda type of [[Erhard Ratdolt]] c. 1486 was cut to suit [[Venice|Venetian]] taste. In 1476 [[William Caxton]], having learned his craft on the Continent, printed the first books in England with a so-called Bâtarde type (an early Schwabacher design), but soon abandoned it.

The early printers of Spain were Germans who began by printing in up-to-date roman types but soon gave these up and adopted Gothic typefaces based on the letterforms of Spanish manuscripts. [[Valencia]] in the Kingdom of Aragon was the location of the first press, established in 1473. From there printers moved to other cities to set up presses. Roman types were used by the printers of Salamanca for their editions of classical authors. Printing in Portuguese began at Lisbon in 1495 (the first book printed in Portugal was a Hebrew book printed in 1489).&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, S. H. (1961) ''Five Hundred Years of Printing''. Harmondsworth: Penguin; pp. 94, 96, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical revival==
In [[Italy]] the heavy gothic styles were soon displaced by ''Venetian'' or "old style" Latin types, also called [[Antiqua (typeface class)|antiqua]]. The [[Roman square capitals|inscriptional capitals]] on [[ancient Rome|Roman]] buildings and [[monument]]s were structured on a [[Euclidean geometry|euclidean]] [[geometry|geometric]] scheme and the [[Classical order|discrete component-based model]] of [[classical architecture]]. Their structurally perfect design, near-perfect execution in stone, balanced angled stressing, contrasting thick and thin strokes, and incised [[serif]]s became the typographic ideal for [[Western culture|western civilization]]. The best-known example of Roman [[Roman square capitals|inscriptional capitals]] exists on the base of Trajan's Column, inscribed c. 113.

[[File:Trajan inscription duotone.jpg|thumb|center|580px|'''[[Roman square capitals|Roman inscriptional capitals]]''' on the base of '''[[Trajan's Column]]''', c. 113.]]

In their enthusiastic [[Neoclassicism|revival of classical culture]], Italian scribes and [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars of the early 15th century searched for ancient lower case letters to match the Roman inscriptional capitals. Practically all of the available manuscripts of classical writers had been rewritten during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], and with a lapse of three hundred years since the widespread use of this style, the humanist scribes mistook [[Carolingian minuscule]] as the authentic writing style of the ancients. Dubbing it ''lettera antica'', they began by copying the minuscule hand almost exactly, combining it with Roman capitals in the same manner as the manuscripts they were copying.&lt;ref name="nesbitt"&gt;Nesbitt, Alexander ''The History and Technique of Lettering'' (c) 1957, [[Dover Publications|Dover Publications, Inc.]] {{ISBN|0-486-20427-8}}  {{OCLC|654540}}. The Dover edition is an abridged and corrected republication of the work originally published in 1950 by Prentice-Hall, Inc. under the title ''Lettering: The History and Technique of Lettering as Design''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carolingian sample.png|thumb|center|538px|'''Sample of Carolingian writing''' from the [[Carolingian Gospel Book (British Library, MS Add. 11848)|Carolingian Gospel Book produced between 820 and 830 AD]]]]

Upon noticing the stylistic mismatch between these two very different letters, the scribes redesigned the small Carolingian letter, lengthening ascenders and descenders, and adding incised serifs and finishing strokes to integrate them with the Roman capitals. By the time [[movable type|moveable type]] reached Italy several decades later, the humanistic writing had evolved into a consistent model known as [[Humanist minuscule|humanistic minuscule]], which served as the basis for type style we know today as Venetian.&lt;ref name="nesbitt"/&gt;

==Transition from humanistic minuscule to roman type==
The classically endowed city of [[Rome]] attracted the first printers known to have set up shop outside Germany, [[Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim]], closely followed by the brothers [[Johann and Wendelin of Speyer]] (de Spira), and the Frenchman [[Nicolas Jenson]]. The sequence of appearance and production dates for types used by these printers have yet to be established with certainty; all four are known to have printed with types ranging from textur Gothic to fully developed romans inspired by the earlier humanistic writing, and within a few years the center of printing in Italy shifted from Rome to [[Venice]].

Some time before 1472 in Venice, Johann and Wendelin issued material printed with a half-Gothic-half-roman type known as "Gotico-antiqua". This design paired simplified Gothic capitals with a rationalized humanistic minuscule letter set, itself combining Gothic minuscule forms with elements of Carolingian, in a one step forward, half step back blending of styles.

Around the same time (1468) in Rome, Pannartz and Sweynheim were using another typeface that closely mimicked humanistic minuscule, known as "Lactantius". Unlike the rigid fractured forms of Speyer's half-Gothic, the Lactantius is characterized by smoothly rendered letters with a restrained organic finish. The Lactantius '''a''' departed from both the Carolingian and Gothic models; a vertical backstem and right-angled top replaced the diagonal Carolingian structure, and a continuous curved stroke replaced the fractured Gothic bowl element.

For details on the evolution of lower case letterforms from Latin capitals, see [[Latin alphabet]].

==Development of roman type==

Jenson's design and the very similar roman types cut by [[Francesco Griffo]] c. 1499 and Erhard Ratdolt c. 1486 are acknowledged as the definitive and [[archetype|archetypal]] roman faces that set the pattern for the majority of western text faces that followed.

The Jenson roman was an explicitly typographic letter designed on its own terms that declined to imitate the appearance of hand-lettering. Its effect is one of a unified cohesive whole, a seamless fusion of style with structure, and the successful convergence of the long progression of preceding letter styles. Jenson adapted the structural unity and component-based modular integration of Roman capitals to humanistic minuscule forms by masterful [[Abstraction|abstract]] stylization. The carefully modelled [[serifs]] follow an artful [[logic]] of [[asymmetry]]. The [[ratio]] of extender lengths to letter bodies and the distance between lines results in balanced, harmonious body of type. Jenson also mirrors the ideal expressed in renaissance painting of carving up space (typographic "white space") with figures (letters) to articulate the relationship between the two and make the white space dynamic.

[[File:Jenson 1475 venice laertius.png|center|thumb|600px|'''[[Nicolas Jenson]]'s roman type''' used in Venice c. 1470. Later "old style" or Venetian book romans such as [[Aldus Manutius|Aldines]], and much later [[Bembo]], were closely based on Jenson.]]

The name "roman" is customarily applied uncapitalized to distinguish early Jenson and Aldine-derived types from classical Roman letters of antiquity. Some parts of Europe call roman "antiqua" from its connection with the humanistic "lettera antica"; "medieval" and "old-style" are also employed to indicate roman types dating from the late 15th century, especially those used by [[Aldus Manutius]] (Italian: Manuzio). Roman faces based on those of Speyer and Jenson are also called Venetian.

==Italic type==
The humanist spirit driving the Renaissance produced its own unique style of formal writing, known as "cursiva humanistica". This slanted and rapidly written letter evolved from humanistic minuscule and the remaining Gothic current cursive hands in Italy, served as the model for ''[[cursive]]'' or italic typefaces. As books printed with early roman types forced humanistic minuscule out of use, cursiva humanistica gained favor as a manuscript hand for the purpose of writing. The popularity of cursive writing itself may have created some demand for a type of this style. The more decisive catalyst was probably the printing of pocket editions of [[Latin literature|Latin classics]] by Aldus Manutius.

The "Aldino" italic type, commissioned by Manutius and cut by Francesco Griffo in 1499, was a closely spaced condensed type. Griffo's punches are a delicate translation of the Italian cursive hand, featuring letters of irregular slant angle and uneven height and vertical position, with some connected pairs (''[[Ligature (typography)|ligature]]s''), and unslanted small roman capitals the height of the lower case '''t'''. The fame of Aldus Manutius and his editions made the Griffo italic widely copied and influential, although it was not the finest of the pioneer italics. The "Aldino" style quickly became known as "italic" from its Italian origin.

Around 1527 the Vatican chancellery scribe [[Ludovico Arrighi]] designed a superior italic type and had the punches cut by Lauticio di Bartolomeo dei Rotelli. The more modular structure of Arrighi's italic and its few ligatures made it less a copy of the cursive hand than Griffo's. Its slightly taller roman capitals, a gentler slant angle, taller ascenders and wider separation of lines gave the elegant effect of refined handwriting.

[[File:Arrighi italic.png|center|thumb|600px|'''Italic type''' designed by Ludovico Arrighi, c. 1527. This elegant design inspired later French italic types.]]

Surviving examples of 16th-century Italian books indicate the bulk of them were printed with italic types. By mid-century the popularity of italic types for sustained text setting began to decline until they were used only for in-line citations, block quotes, preliminary text, emphasis, and abbreviations. Italic types from the 20th century up to the present are much indebted to Arrighi and his influence on French designers.

Swiss art historian [[Jakob Burckhardt]] described the classically inspired Renaissance ''modello'' of dual case roman and cursive italic types as "The model and ideal for the whole western world". Venetian pre-eminence in type design was brought to an end by the political and economic turmoil that concluded the Renaissance in Italy with the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome in 1527]].

==Renaissance Germany and Switzerland==
Soon after 1500, roman typefaces began to gain popularity north of the Alps for printing of Latin literature.  [[Johann Froben]] of [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] set up his press in 1491, and by about 1519 (when he printed [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]'s famous edition of the Greek [[New Testament]]) he had established a set of standards for humanistic printing which were widely copied throughout the German-speaking world and also in [[Spain]] and, to a lesser extent in England.  His principal type is wholly roman in the shape of the characters but retains an echo of gothic influence in the angled serifs and the way the thick and thin strokes are organized; it was coupled with mated sets of woodcut initials (often designed by distinguished artists) and with two larger sizes of uppercase letters for use in title pages and headings—Froben was the first to use such 'display faces' consistently, breaking away from the Italian tradition in which title pages and headings tended to be set in the same size as the main text.  By using these large faces, Froben developed the title page as a fully organized artistic whole. Froben's italic face is based on that of Aldus but more even and uniform in effect.  These Swiss books are the first to have been designed in every detail as printed artifacts rather than as adaptations of manuscript technique.

After about 1550 this Swiss/German tradition was gradually overwhelmed by French influence.  Towards the end of the 16th century, the [[Wechel]] family of [[Frankfurt]], previously based in Paris, was producing fine books which used French typefaces in conjunction with heavy but resplendent woodcut ornaments to achieve a splendid page effect;  but soon after 1600 there was a general, marked decline in the quality of both skill and materials, from which German printing did not recover until the 20th century.

==16th century France==
Typography was introduced to France by the German printers Martin Crantz, Michael Freyburger and Ulrich Gering, who set up a press in [[Paris]] in 1470, where they printed with an inferior copy of the Lactantius type. Gothic types dominated in France until the end of the 15th century, when they were gradually supplanted by roman designs. [[Jodocus Badius Ascensius]] (Josse Bade) in partnership with [[Henri Estienne]] established a press in Paris in 1503. Printing with undeveloped Roman and half-Gothic types, the French pair were too occupied meeting the demand for Humanistic and classical texts to design any original types of their own. French books nonetheless began to follow the format established by Italian printers, and [[Lyon]] and Paris became the new centers of activity. Eventually, the French government fixed a standard height for all type, to ensure that different batches could be used together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers|date=1765|location=Paris|pages=Vol. 8, p. 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De Colines, Estienne, and Augereau===
After their 1494 invasion of Italy the French were greatly influenced by Renaissance culture, and later set about converting French culture from Gothic to neo-classical. The required phonetic and orthographic changes to French language hindered the evolution of type design in France until the late 1520s. At the end of this period roman types introduced by [[Robert Estienne]], [[Simon de Colines]] and Antoine Augereau began a phase of type design with a distinctly French character. Robert Estienne carried on the establishment of his father Henri Estienne, who had died in 1520. Simon de Colines had been the elder Estienne's assistant, married his widow, and set up his own press.

The de Colines roman of 1531 resembled Griffo's 1499 roman but did not copy it closely. Narrower forms and tighter letter fit; '''a''' with low angled bowl; elevated triangular stem serifs on '''i''', '''j''', '''m''', '''n''' and '''r'''; flattened [[baseline (typography)|baseline]] serifs, delicately modeled [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] serifs and graceful, fluid lines characterize the French style. Robert Estienne's roman of 1532 was similar to the de Colines face, which Estienne complemented with a fine italic type based on that of Arrighi. The craftsmen who cut the punches for the romans used by Estienne and de Colines remain unidentified. In 1532 Antoine Augereau cut the punches for a roman type very close to Estienne's. The lower cases of the Estienne and Augereau types became the basis for post-Renaissance old style typography, and were copied by French typographers for the next 150&amp;nbsp;years.

===Garamond===
[[File:GaramondSpecimenA.svg|right|thumb|200px|'''Garamond type''' revival by [[Robert Slimbach]].]]

The svelte French style reached its fullest refinement in the roman types attributed to the best-known figure of French typography&amp;mdash;[[Claude Garamond]] (also Garamont). In 1541 [[Robert Estienne]], printer to the king, helped Garamond obtain commissions to cut the sequence of Greek fonts for King [[Francis I of France]], known as the "[[grecs du roi]]". A number of roman faces used in Garamond's publishing activities can be positively attributed to him as punch-cutter. From the dates of their appearance, and their similarity to romans used by Estienne, [[Christoffel Plantijn]] and the printer André Wechel, the types known as "Canon de Garamond" and "Petit Canon de Garamond" shown on a specimen sheet issued by the Egenolff-Berner foundry in 1592 are generally accepted as [[Garamond|Claude Garamond's final roman types]].

===Robert Granjon===
[[File:Evangelium Sanctum Domini Nostri Jesu Christi in Arabic 1590 with Arabic types of Robert Grandjon Rome Typographia Medicea.jpg|thumb|left|''Evangelium Sanctum Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'' in [[Arabic]], 1590, with Arabic types of Robert Grandjon, ''[[Typographia Medicea]]'', [[Rome]].]]
[[Robert Granjon]] worked in the second half of the 16th century, mainly at Lyon, but was also recorded at Paris, Rome and [[Antwerp]]. He is still famous because of his [[Civilité]] types, imitating French gothic cursive calligraphy.  His main contribution was an italic type known as "Parangon de Granjon". Italic type design had apparently become corrupted since the Arrighi and Aldine models. Granjon's italic had a greater slant angle, slanted roman capitals, and reduced weight and rigor. These qualities and its contrasting thick and thin strokes gave it a dazzling appearance that made it difficult to read. It was nevertheless the main influence for italic type design until the Arrighi model was revived in 1920.

In the 16th century, Western printers also developed Oriental types, such as [[François Savary de Brèves]] or Robert Granjon, usually with the objective of proselytizing the Catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/orient.html Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture/ Orient to Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition to modern type: 17th and 18th century==
[[Baroque]] and [[rococo]] aesthetic trends, use of the pointed-pen for writing, and steel [[engraving]] techniques effected a gradual shift in typographic style. Contrast between thick and thin strokes increased. Tilted stressing transformed into vertical stressing; full rounds were compressed. Blunt bracketed serifs grew sharp and delicate until they were fine straight lines. Detail became clean and precise.

Transitional roman types combined the classical features of lettera antiqua with the vertical stressing and higher contrast between thick and thin strokes characteristic of the true modern romans to come.

The roman types used c. 1618 by the Dutch printing firm of [[House of Elzevir|Elzevir]] in [[Leyden]] reiterated the 16th-century French style with higher contrast, less rigor and a lighter page effect. After 1647 most Elzevir faces were cut by the highly regarded Christoffel van Dyck, whose precise renditions were regarded by some experts at the time as finer than Garamond's.

===Fell types===
[[File:Fell english roman thumb.png|thumb|200px|right|Specimen of '''Fell type''' English roman, quoting [[Cicero]]'s [[In_Catilinam#Oratio_in_Catilinam_Prima_in_Senatu_Habita|First Oration against Catiline]].]]

From mid-16th century until the end of the 17th, interference with printing by the British Crown thwarted the development of [[type foundry|type founding]] in England&amp;mdash;most type used by 17th-century English printers was of Dutch origin. The lack of material inspired Bishop of Oxford [[John Fell (clergyman)|Doctor John Fell]] to purchase punches &amp; matrices from Holland c. 1670&amp;ndash;1672 for use by the [[Oxford University Press]]. The so-named Fell types, presumed to be the work of Dutch [[punchcutting|punchcutter]] Dirck Voskens, mark a noticeable jump from previous designs, with considerably shorter extenders, higher stroke contrast, narrowing of round letters, and flattened serifs on the baseline and descenders. The design retained a retrogressive old-style irregularity, smooth modeling from vertical to horizontal, and angled stressing of rounds (except a vertically stressed '''o'''). Fell capitals were condensed, even-width, with wide flattened serifs; all characteristics of the definitive modern romans of the late 18th century. Fell italic types were distinguished by high contrast matching the Fell romans; wider ovals; a split-branching stroke from the stems of '''m n r''' and '''u'''; and long, flat serifs&amp;mdash;prefiguring modern. They repeated the non-uniform slant of French models, and the capitals included swash '''J''' and '''Q''' forms.

An open-source digitisation of the Fell Types has been released by designer and engineer Igino Marini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marini|first1=Igino|title=The Fell Types|url=http://iginomarini.com/fell/|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caslon===
[[File:Caslon english roman thumb.png|thumb|200px|right|'''[[Caslon|Caslon English roman]]''', from a sample issued by the Caslon foundry and quoting the same text. Compare against the Fell type.]]
The first major figure in English typography is reckoned by type historians to have ended the monopoly of Dutch type founding almost single-handedly. The gun engraver-turned-punchcutter [[William Caslon]] spent 14&amp;nbsp;years creating the [[Caslon|stable of typefaces on the specimen sheet issued in 1734]]. The complete canon included roman, italic, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic ''etc.'' Caslon's Great Primer roman and English roman were retrogressive designs that very closely followed the Fell types and the roman of Miklós (Nicholas) Kis c. 1685 falsely attributed to [[Anton Janson]]. Like the Fells, Caslon's slightly bracketed serifs and old-style irregularity gave it a homely charm&amp;mdash;its precise cut and perpendicularity place it firmly in the 18th century however. Caslon's italic structures follow the Fell italics, but at a condensed width and with conventional branching from stems.

William Caslon's prodigious output was influential worldwide. Caslon type and its imitations were used throughout the expanding [[British empire]]. It was the dominant type in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] for the second half of the 18th century. Caslon marks the rise of England as the center of typographic activity.

===Fleischmann===
[[Joan Michaël Fleischman]] (1701&amp;ndash;1768) was born in [[Nürnberg]] where he trained as a punchcutter. He found employment with Dutch type founders in Holland and settled there c. 1728. At the Enschedé foundry in [[Haarlem]] he cut punches for a large amount of material. Some time after 1743 he produced a distinguished roman design&amp;mdash;related to the preceding transitional types but departing from them. It prefigured modern romans with sparse transaxial modeling joining the vertical stressing to hairline thins, and ball-ends. Fleischmann borrowed from the general mode of Phillipe Grandjean’s and Louis Simonneau’s "[[Romain du Roi]]," commissioned by [[Louis XIV]] in 1692&lt;ref name="meggs58"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Meggs | first = Philip B. | authorlink = Philip B. Meggs | title = A History of Graphic Design | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | year = 1998 | location =  | edition = Third | pages = 108–109 | isbn = 978-0-471-29198-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the Imprimerie Royale, but did not imitate that face. Fleischmann's capitals were a new variety; an even-width scheme, compressed rounds, all-vertical stressing, and triangular beak ends of '''E F L T''' and '''Z''', all characteristics prefiguring the "classical" moderns of [[Bodoni]] and [[Didot (typeface)|Didot]]. Fleischmann's italic bore some resemblance to Granjean's but had longer ascenders and followed the established Dutch structures for '''h v''' and '''w'''.

Fleischmann was held in great esteem by his contemporaries, his designs exerting a decisive influence in the last quarter of the 18th century. Renowned French punchcutter [[Pierre Simon Fournier]] (1712–1768), confessed to having copied Fleischmann's design, and was first to dub "contrast" types like the Fells, Caslon and Fleischmann "modern". Fournier's rococo-influenced designs&amp;mdash;Fournier and Narcissus&amp;mdash;and his Modèles des Caractères (1742) continued the romaine du roi style and adapted it for his own modern age. Like Baskerville, his italics were inspired by handwriting and the engraved lettering known as [[copperplate_script | copperplate]] hand. Fournier also published a two volume ''Manuel Typographique'', in which he recorded much European typographic history, and introduced the first standardized system of type size measurement&amp;mdash;the "point".

===Baskerville===
[[File:basker specimen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|'''The [[Baskerville]] typeface''' designed by John Baskerville.]]
The roman and italic types of [[John Baskerville]] c. 1772 appeared later than Fleischman's but are considered transitional and partly retrogressive with a return to lower contrast, smooth transaxial modeling, finely modeled bracketed serifs, and long stems. The exquisite design and finish of Baskerville's roman however, combining elegance and strength, was modern. His roman design, and especially his italic, were rococo-influenced. His designs did not visibly quote any previous types. They were informed by his prior experience as a writing master and the influences of his time. The types of Joseph Fry, Alexander Wilson, and John Bell closely followed Baskerville, and through his correspondence with European type founders Baskerville's influence penetrated most of western Europe. Baskerville was a meticulous artist who controlled all aspects of his creation, devising more accurate presses, blacker inks and paper sealed with hot rollers to ensure crisp impressions. Of particular note, the lower storey of his lowercase g does not fully close. Derivatives of Baskerville are often identified thus. A modern revival of Baskerville, a font called [[Mrs Eaves]], is named after Baskerville's wife who was the widow of Richard Eaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Penney|first=Chris|title=Dr B T Davis's bequest|journal=Research Libraries Bulletin|issue=6|page=21|issn=1355-9877|url=http://www.special-coll.bham.ac.uk/rlb_autumn98.pdf|accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern romans===
[[File:Bodoni mt thumb ls.png|thumb|200px|right|'''[[Facsimile]] of sample''' published with genuine [[Bodoni]] types by the Officina Bodoni in 1925. The font shown is the digital Bodoni [[Monotype]] c. 1999.]][[File:AFDidotSpecimen.svg|right|thumb|200px|'''Didot type''' Revival designed in 1991 by Adrian Frutiger for [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company|Linotype foundry]].]]
True modern romans arrived with the types of the Italian [[Giambattista Bodoni]] and the French [[Didot family|Didot]]s. Completing trends begun by the Fell types, Fleischman, Fournier and Baskerville, the so-called "classical" modern romans eschewed [[chirography|chirographic]] and organic influences, their synthetic [[Symmetry|symmetric]] geometry answering to a rationalized and reformed classical model driven by the [[Cartesian coordinate system|strict cartesian grid]] philosophy of [[René Descartes]] and the predictable clockwork universe of [[Isaac Newton]].

The "classical" appellation of modern romans stems from their return to long ascenders and descenders set on widely spaced lines, and a corresponding light page effect reminiscent of old-style&amp;mdash;occurring at a time of classical revival.

Bodoni was foremost in progressing from rococo to the new classical style. He produced an italic very close to Baskerville's, and a French cursive script type falling in between italic type and joined scripts. The roman types of [[Didot family#François-Ambroise Didot|Francois Ambroise Didot]] and son [[Firmin Didot]] closely resemble the work of Bodoni, and opinion is divided over whether the Didots or Bodoni originated the first modern romans. At any rate the Didots' mathematical precision and vanishing of rococo design reflected the "enlightenment" of post-revolution France under [[Napoleon]]. Francois Ambroise also designed "maigre" and "gras" types corresponding to later condensed and expanded font formats.

The Spanish designer [[Joaquín Ibarra]]'s roman was influenced by Baskerville, Didot and Bodoni, but hewn nearer to old-style and used in the same classical manner, including spaced capitals. In England modern romans resembling Bodoni's were cut for the printer [[William Bulmer]] c. 1786 by the punchcutter William Martin, who had been apprenticed to Baskerville and influenced by him. Martin's italic mirrored the open-tail '''g''' and overall finesse of Baskerville's.

In Britain and the United States, modern romans (emerging around 1800 and totally dominant by the 1820s) took a somewhat more rounded, less geometrical form than the designs of Didot and Bodoni; an obvious difference is that in Anglo-American faces the upper-case C has only one serif (at the top) whereas in European designs it has two.

== 19th and 20th century typography ==
&lt;!-- E.g., Art deco and art nouveau fonts --&gt;

===Industrialization===
The 19th century brought fewer stylistic innovations. The most notable invention was the rise of typefaces with strengthened serifs. Forerunners were the so-called [[Slab serif|Egyptienne]] fonts, which were used already at the beginning of the 19th century. Their name likely comes from the enthusiasm of the Napoleonic era for the orient, which in turn was started by Napoleon's [[French Invasion of Egypt (1798)|invasion in Egypt]]. In fact slab-serif fonts (''e.&amp;thinsp;g.'' [[Clarendon (typeface)|Clarendon]] from 1845) were newspaper fonts, whose serifs were strengthened in order to prevent damage during the printing process. Stylistically the serif fonts of the mid-19th century appeared very robust and otherwise had more or less neo-classical design features, which changed during the course of time: By the application of the slab serif design feature and by appending serifs to more and more typefaces, an independent intermediate group of heterogeneous fonts emerged during the 20th century. Meanwhile, the slab serifs are listed as an independent group in most typeface classifications&amp;mdash;besides both main groups '''serif''' and '''sans serif'''.

Slab-serif and sanserif types were rarely used for continuous bodies of text; their realm was that of advertisements, title-pages and other attention-catching pieces of print. By about 1820, most western countries were using modern romans and italics for continuous texts. This remained true until the 1860s, when so-called 'old style' faces&amp;mdash;a largely English-speaking phenomenon&amp;mdash;came into use. These went to the opposite extreme from the modern faces; 'thick' strokes were attenuated, and serifs at the end of thin strokes (as in C, E, L and T) were narrow and angled whereas in modern faces they were broad and vertical or nearly so. All the upper-case characters were somewhat 'condensed' (narrowed). Old style faces remained popular until about 1910.

Above all the 19th century was innovative regarding technical aspects. Automatic manufacturing processes changed the print as well as the graphical illustrations. The illustration of printed matters could be considerably standardised due to the [[lithography]] technique invented by [[Alois Senefelder]]. Finally, another invention was [[photography]], whose establishment at the end of the 19th century led to the first [[halftone|halftoning]] and reproduction procedures. The step-by-step development of a modern mass society provided a growing demand of printed matters. Besides the traditional letterpress beginnings of a newspaper landscape as well as a broad market for publications, advertisements, and posters of all kinds appeared. The challenges had changed: since printing and typography had been a straightforward craft for centuries, it now had to face the challenges of an industry-ruled mass society.

===Hot type and phototypesetting in the 20th century===
[[File:Monotype-machine.jpg|thumb|left|[[Monotype Corporation|Monotype]] machine]]
[[File:exlibris-1921.png|thumb|left|[[Bookplate|Exlibris]], 1921]]
The 90 years between 1890 and 1980 coined typography until now. The craft of printing became an industry, and the typography became a part of it as well. Both stylistically and technologically this epoch was really tumultuous. The significant developments were the following:
*The fabrication and application of typefaces more and more were affected by industrial '''manufacturing processes'''. Significant incidents were the invention of the [[Hot metal typesetting|hot type]] machine by [[Ottmar Mergenthaler]] ([[Linotype machine]], 1886) and [[Tolbert Lanston]] ([[Monotype Corporation|Monotype machine]], 1887) and a few decades later the emergence of [[phototypesetting]]. The result: Compilation and typographical design of the text could be more and more controlled by keyboards in contrast to manual typesetting.
*A result of the industrialisation process was the unimagined '''number and distribution of new typefaces'''. Whether [[Digital data|digital]] variants of ''Garamond'' and ''Bodoni'' or new contemporary type designs like ''[[Futura (typeface)|Futura]]'', ''[[Times Roman|Times]]'', and ''[[Helvetica]]'', nearly all currently used typefaces have their origin either in the following and ongoing [[Typesetting#Digital era|digital typesetting era]] or are based on designs of this epoch. The basis was the appearance of large [[type foundry|type foundries]] and type manufacturers. The result: Successful typefaces could quickly gain the status of a trademark&amp;mdash;and therefore were able to assign a unique "[[brand]]ing" to products or publications.
*Besides the traditional typography of books '''[[graphic design]]''' became a more or less independent branch. The tensions between those two branches significantly determined the stylistic development of 20th century's typography.

===Art nouveau and New Book Art===
[[File:Typeface-eckmann.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eckmann (typeface)|Eckmann]], 1901.]]
Since [[impressionism]] the modern art styles were reflected in graphic design and typography too. Since 1890 the [[Art nouveau]] became popular. Its floral ornaments, the curved forms, as well as the emphasis on graphical realisation inspired the type designers of the start of the 20th century. A popular art nouveau font was the ''[[Eckmann (typeface)|Eckmann]]'' designed by graphic artist [[Otto Eckmann]]. Furthermore, the influence of art nouveau was expressed in a lot of book illustrations and [[Bookplate|exlibris]] designs.

Altogether the return to the roots of book art become stronger around the start of the 20th century. It was initiated by British typographer, socialist, and [[private press]] publisher [[William Morris]] as well as by the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], which refers to him. Essentially this movement initiated three things: a return to the antiqua-models of the Renaissance, clarity and simplicity of book illustrations, and straightforward technical processes during the production of printed matters. An immediate consequence of the Arts and Crafts Movement was the establishment of the private press movement, which more or less was committed to Morris' ideals, and whose remains partially are still present today. An established meeting point of this scene in Germany for example is the [[Mainzer Minipressen-Messe]], which actually is held every two years.

Especially the [[New Book Art]] movement, which formed in the decade before [[World War I]], was influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement. The young type designers of the pre-war era, among them [[Fritz Helmuth Ehmcke]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Kleukens]], rejected both the late typographical classicism and the ornaments of the popular Art nouveau. The new ideal became a tidy and straightforward book typography, which dedicated itself to the ideas of the Renaissance. [[Walter Tiemann]] in Leipzig, [[Friedrich Hermann Ernst Schneidler]] in Stuttgart, and [[Rudolf Koch]] in Offenbach as instructors were the mentors of this kind of typography. They stayed influential in the field of book typesetting until a long time after the end of [[World War II]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2417">'''IP over [[DWDM]]''' ('''IPoDWDM''') is a technology used in [[telecommunications networks]] to integrate IP [[Router (computing)|Routers]] and Switches in the OTN ([[Optical Transport Network]]).
A true IPoDWDM solution is implemented only when the IP Routers and  Switches  support ITU-T G.709.&lt;ref name=G709&gt;“Interfaces for Optical Transport Network (OTN)”, ITU-T G.709/Y.1331&lt;/ref&gt; In this way IP devices can monitor the optical path and implement the transport functionality as FEC ([[Forward Error Correction]]) specified by [[ITU-T]] [[G.709/Y.1331]]&lt;ref name=G709/&gt; or [[Super FEC]] functionality defined in ITU-T G.975.1.&lt;ref&gt;“Forward error correction for high bit-rate DWDM submarine systems”, ITU-T G.975.1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
This approach saves network components including shelves, processors, interfaces cards and hence it permits to reduce the power consumption, OPEX ([[Operational expenditure]]) and CAPEX  ([[capital expenditure]]).
This approach brings also a simplification of the network, eliminating the [[Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]]/[[SONET]] intermediate layer.&lt;ref&gt;Virgilio Puglia, Olga Zadedyurina, [http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/29/02/T29020000090053PDFE.pdf “optical transport networks: from all-optical to digital”], IEEE,31/08/2009 {{ISBN|978-92-61-12891-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multivendors==
A DWDM network can be implemented using different vendor technology from the IP devices as long as they support [[alien wavelength]] transmission specified by ITU-T G.698.2.&lt;ref&gt;D. Ventorini, E. Moura, L. Paraschis, O. Gerstel, M. Silva, K. Wollenweber, A.J. Silverio, P.P. Henrique, L.A.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14733">The '''Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO''' ('''IOC/UNESCO''') was established by resolution 2.31 adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]]. It first met in Paris at Unesco Headquarters from 19 to 27 October 1961. Initially, 40 States became members of the Commission. The IOC assists governments to address their individual and collective ocean and coastal management needs, through the sharing of knowledge, information and technology as well as through the co-ordination of programs and building capacity in ocean and coastal research, observations and services.

The IOC is the only UN body specialized in ocean science and services. It provides a focus for other UN organizations and agencies with regard to ocean science, observations and data exchange, and services such as global [[tsunami warning system]]s. Established in 1960, the Commission celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010 and currently has 147 Member States. Since the IOC often has its own accreditation within meetings such as those of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), this gives UNESCO two seats and two voices at the table.

The IOC has been a key player in the recent international debate on sustainable development as it relates to the ocean. The Rio+20 outcome document affirmed the importance of “the ocean and coasts” to the sustainability debate, and is the basis for IOC’s ongoing support to the creation of a Sustainable Development Goal dedicated to the ocean. The IOC is closely involved in several international partnerships for ocean sustainability such as with the CBD, UN-Oceans and the World Ocean Assessment.

The IOC/UNESCO is composed of its Member States (147 in 2014), an Assembly, an Executive Council and a Secretariat. The Secretariat is based in Paris, France. Additionally the IOC has a number of Subsidiary Bodies: three regional sub-commissions (IOCARIBE, IOCAFRICA, and WESTPAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icriforum.org/about-icri/members-networks/intergovernmental-oceanographic-commission-unesco-ioc-unesco|title=Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC-UNESCO) {{!}} International Coral Reef Initiative|website=www.icriforum.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and programme and project offices in Apia (Samoa), Bangkok (Thailand), Cartagena (Colombia), Copenhagen (Denmark), Jakarta (Indonesia), Kingston (Jamaica), Nairobi (Kenya), Muscat (Oman), Perth (Australia), and Port-au-Prince (Haiti). The JCOMM in situ Observations Programme Support Centre, currently hosted in Toulouse (France), is in the process of moving to Brest (France). Additionally, IOC has a strong presence in Oostende (Belgium), where the International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) and the Secretariat for the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) are based. Under IOC mandate, the IODE coordinates since 1961 the exchange of information and data between the IOC Member States and its national oceanographic data centers. As for OBIS, it was established by the [[Census of Marine Life]] program (www.coml.org), and developed between 2000 and 2010 as an evolving strategic alliance of people and organizations sharing a vision to make marine biogeographic data, from all over the world, freely available over the World Wide Web. Any organization, consortium, project or individual may contribute data to OBIS.

== IOC High Level Objectives (2014-2021)==

# '''Healthy ocean ecosystems and sustained [[ecosystem services]]'''

The IOC is working to improve responses to unprecedented environmental changes and to promote ocean health via marine sciences. The IOC supports the UN World Ocean Assessment, the UNGA-led regular process for reviewing the state of the marine environment, including socio-economic aspects. Integrating existing information from different disciplines on the state of the ocean will improve policy responses from national governments and the international community. The IOC-led Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and the Joint World Meteorological Organization (WMO)-IOC Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) are also successful examples of multilateral efforts for ocean monitoring, observation, and services. GOOS coordinates the deployment of observation technologies, rapid and universal dissemination of data flows, and delivery of marine information to managers, decision makers, and the general public. JCOMM is an intergovernmental body of technical experts drawn from the meteorological and oceanographic communities to provide observing capabilities, data management, and services.

# '''Effective early warning systems and preparedness for tsunamis and other ocean-related hazards'''

The IOC aids and advises policy makers and managers in the reduction of risks from [[tsunami]]s, [[storm surge]]s, Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) and other [[coastal hazards]]. After close to fifty years of experience coordinating the Pacific Tsunami Warning System (PTWS), IOC-UNESCO is leading a global effort to establish ocean-based tsunami warning systems as part of an overall multi-hazard disaster reduction strategy. The IOC Tsunami Unit works with Member States, together with other UN agencies and NGOs, to build sustainable tsunami early warning systems. In this context, the IOC coordinates and fosters the establishment of regional intergovernmental tsunami warning and mitigation systems in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, in the Caribbean, and in the North East Atlantic, the Mediterranean and connected seas. Through its Intergovernmental Panel on Harmful Algae (IPHAB), the IOC also works to establish systems that can predict the occurrences and mitigate the effects of HAB events.

# '''Increased resiliency to climate change and variability and enhanced safety, efficiency and effectiveness of ocean-based activities through scientifically-founded services, adaptation and mitigation strategies'''

The IOC works with developed and developing countries to monitor and document changes in order to aid in the design of adaptation and mitigation strategies. Through GOOS, the IOC monitors the physical, chemical and biological aspects and changes in the world’s ocean. This unified network permits the design of adaptation and mitigation strategies and provides information and data for governments, industry, scientists and the general public. The IOC is also actively pushing to convince decision makers of the importance of sound scientific knowledge in designing policy on integrated coastal management, HABs,  and ocean acidification (through blue carbon research and initiatives). Ocean acidification is of particular concern to the IOC, as increasing CO2 levels in the ocean are associated with coral bleaching, changes in marine biodiversity, and other related problems.

# '''Enhanced knowledge of emerging ocean science issues'''

The IOC actively assists Member States in the design and implementation of new Marine Spatial Planning tools, both at the political and managerial levels, for [[ecosystem-based management]] of marine and coastal areas. Through its International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange programme (IODE), the IOC facilitates the exploitation, development, and exchange of oceanographic data and information among participating Member States. IODE seeks, in particular, to train marine information specialists from developing countries. The Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) manages the global marine biodiversity knowledge base, through which hundreds of institutions and scientists contribute information on the past and current diversity, abundance and distribution of marine life. OBIS data is used worldwide for planning ocean conservation policies, and identifying biodiversity hotspots and distribution trends. It allows the IOC to provide expertise, data and information for environmental, climate change, and marine biodiversity assessments.

== IOC Contributions to UNESCO's Global Priorities ==

* '''GENDER'''

The IOC is committed to promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment in ocean science. Through the Network of Women in Ocean Science (NOW in Ocean Science), the IOC hopes to mobilize women marine scientists to work with IOC to create a space for exchange of experience and opportunities for young women willing to start a career in marine science.

* '''AFRICA'''

The IOC has established a Sub-Commission for Africa and adjacent islands to reinforce the implementation of IOC programmes in Africa and mobilize extra-budgetary resources. The IOC Regional Office, established within the UNESCO Office in Nairobi, Kenya, became operational in 2012 and has formulated IOC's strategic plan for the region.

== IOC &amp; Capacity Development ==

The IOC seeks to empower developing countries through fund-raising, team building, and decision-making skills development to sustainably use their coastal and marine resources by encouraging ‘self-driven’ capacity-development. This approach aims to reduce dependence on aid while creating incentives for states to more fully integrate scientific know-how into policy design and implementation processes.

* '''Transfer of Marine Technology'''

The IOC of UNESCO is recognized in the UN-wide system for its traditional competencies in the field of Transfer of Marine Technology (Part XIV) of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). On the occasion of its first session in 20012, the IOC’s Advisory Body of Experts on the Law of the Sea (IOC/ABE-LOS), an IOC subsidiary body whose function is to provide advice on the IOC’s role in relation to UNCLOS upon the request from the IOC governing bodies, accepted the challenge of drawing the Criteria and Guidelines on Transfer of Marine Technology (CGTMT), following the instructions set forth in Article 271 of UNCLOS:
''States, directly or through competent international organizations, shall promote the establishment of generally accepted guidelines, criteria and standards for the transfer of marine technology on a bilateral basis or within the framework of international organizations and other fore, taking into account, in particular, the interests and needs of developing States''

In the CGTMT, marine technology refers to instruments, equipment, vessels, processes and methodologies required to produce and use knowledge to improve the study and understanding of the nature and resources of the ocean and coastal areas. In this sense, marine technology may include any of the following components:

a)Information and data, in a user-friendly format, on marine sciences and related marine operations and services&lt;br /&gt;
b)Manuals, guidelines, criteria, standards, reference materials&lt;br /&gt;
c)Sampling and methodology equipment (e.g., for water, geological, biological, chemical samples)&lt;br /&gt;
d)Observation facilities and equipment (e.g., remote sensing equipment, buoys, tide gauges, shipboard and other means of ocean observation)&lt;br /&gt;
e)Equipment for in situ and laboratory observations, analysis and experimentation&lt;br /&gt;
f)Computer and computer software, including models and modeling techniques&lt;br /&gt;
g)Expertise, knowledge, skills, technical/scientific/legal know-how and analytical methods related to marine scientific research and observation

Transfer of Marine Technology (TMT) should enable all parties concerned to benefit on an equitable basis from developments in marine science related activities, in particular, those aiming at stimulating the social and economic contexts in developing States.

* '''Flagship initiative: OceanTeacher Global Academy'''
{{update section|date=July 2018}}
OceanTeacher (OT) has been developed as a training system for ocean data managers (working in ocean data centres), marine information managers (marine librarians) as well as for marine researchers who wish to acquire knowledge on data and/or information for planning and management. Since 2005, more than a thousand students from over a hundred countries attended courses at the IOC Project Office for IODE, based in Oostende, Belgium, and in the context of regional projects. The “Global Academy” component of OT (OTGA) is still being developed, but it seeks to expand the program into a worldwide training facility, with training courses related to multiple IOC fields (from ICAM to Tsunami Alert Systems) in various Regional Training Centers (RTCs), all of them connected in real time via the OceanTeacher Learning Management System, and using a multilingual approach to scientific training (English, Spanish, and other national languages, depending on the regional and national context). OTGA will change training from a “north to south” culture to a north-south, south-south, and south-north model by promoting the expertise available in developing countries. This new "OceanTeacher Global Academy" concept will be implemented during 2014. OTGA will be broadcasting from and to anywhere across the world.

'''MASC''' is a balanced subset of 500K words of written texts and transcribed speech drawn primarily from the Open [[American National Corpus]] (OANC). The OANC is a 15 million word (and growing) corpus of American English produced since 1990, all of which is in the public domain or otherwise free of usage and redistribution restrictions.

All of MASC includes manually validated annotations for logical structure (headings, sections, paragraphs, etc.), sentence boundaries, three different tokenizations with associated part of speech tags, shallow parse (noun and verb chunks), named entities (person, location, organization, date and time), and [https://web.archive.org/web/20131109202842/http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/ Penn Treebank] syntax. Additional manually produced or validated annotations have been produced by the MASC project for portions of the sub-corpus, including full-text annotation for [[FrameNet]] frame elements and a 100K+ sentence corpus with [[WordNet]] 3.1 sense tags, of which one-tenth are also annotated for [[FrameNet]] frame elements. Annotations of all or portions of the sub-corpus for a wide variety of other linguistic phenomena have been contributed by other projects, including [[PropBank]], [[TimeBank]], [http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/corpora/mpqa_corpus/ MPQA opinion], and several others. Co-reference annotations and clause boundaries of the entire MASC corpus are scheduled to be released by the end of 2016.

WordNet sense annotations for all occurrences of 114 words are also included in the MASC distribution, as well as [[FrameNet]] annotations for 50-100 occurrences of each of the 114 words. The sentences with [[WordNet]] and [[FrameNet]] annotations are also distributed as a part of the [http://www.anc.org/data/masc/wordnet-framenet-annotations/ MASC Sentence Corpus].

== Genres ==

Unlike most freely available corpora including a wide variety of linguistic annotations, MASC contains a balanced selection of texts from a broad range of genres:

Single-molecule biomechanics studies of proteins and DNA, and mechanochemical coupling in [[molecular motors]] have demonstrated the critical importance of molecular mechanics as a new frontier in [[bioengineering]] and life sciences. Protein domains, connected by intrinsically disordered [[flexible linker]] domains, induce long-range [[Allosteric regulation|allostery]] via [[Protein dynamics#Global flexibility: multiple domains|protein domain dynamics]].
The resultant dynamic modes cannot be generally predicted from static structures of either the entire protein or individual domains. They can however be inferred by comparing different structures of a protein (as in [[Database of Molecular Motions]]).  They can also be suggested by sampling in extensive molecular dynamics trajectories&lt;ref name="potestioBJ2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Potestio R, Pontiggia F, Micheletti C | title = Coarse-grained description of protein internal dynamics: an optimal strategy for decomposing proteins in rigid subunits | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 96 | issue = 12 | pages = 4993–5002  | date = Jun 2009 | pmid = 19527659 | pmc = 2712024 | doi = 10.1016/j.bpj.2009.03.051 | url = http://www.cell.com/biophysj/abstract/S0006-3495%2809%2900781-4 | bibcode = 2009BpJ....96.4993P }}&lt;/ref&gt; and principal component analysis,&lt;ref name="pmid22802671"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron R, Vellore NA | title = LSD1/CoREST is an allosteric nanoscale clamp regulated by H3-histone-tail molecular recognition | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 31 | pages = 12509–14  | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22802671 | pmc = 3411975 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1207892109 | bibcode = 2012PNAS..10912509B }}&lt;/ref&gt; or they can be directly observed using spectra&lt;ref name="pmid21081097"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farago B, Li J, Cornilescu G, Callaway DJ, Bu Z | title = Activation of nanoscale allosteric protein domain motion revealed by neutron spin echo spectroscopy | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 99 | issue = 10 | pages = 3473–3482 | date = Nov 2010 | pmid = 21081097 | pmc = 2980739 | doi = 10.1016/j.bpj.2010.09.058 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-3495(10)01208-7 | bibcode = 2010BpJ....99.3473F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bu Z, Biehl R, Monkenbusch M, Richter D, Callaway DJ | title = Coupled protein domain motion in Taq polymerase revealed by neutron spin-echo spectroscopy | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 49 | pages = 17646–17651  | date = Dec 2005 | pmid = 16306270 | pmc = 1345721 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0503388102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..10217646B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
measured by [[neutron spin echo]] spectroscopy. Current findings indicate that the mechanotransduction channel in hair cells is a complex [[biological machine]].

== Ear ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}
One such mechanism is the opening of [[ion channels]] in the [[hair cell]]s of the [[cochlea]] in the inner ear.

Air pressure changes in the ear canal cause the vibrations of the [[tympanic membrane]] and middle ear ossicles. At the end of the ossicular chain, movement of the stapes footplate within the [[oval window]] of the cochlea, in turn, generates a pressure field within the cochlear fluids, imparting a pressure differential across the [[basilar membrane]]. A sinusoidal pressure wave results in localized vibrations of the [[organ of Corti]]: near the base for high frequencies, near the apex for low frequencies. The cochlea thus acts as an 'acoustic prism', distributing the energy of each [[Fourier transform|Fourier]] component of a complex sound at different locations along its longitudinal axis. Hair cells in the cochlea are stimulated when the basilar membrane is driven up and down by differences in the fluid pressure between the [[scala vestibuli]] and [[scala tympani]]. Because this motion is accompanied by a shearing motion between the [[tectorial membrane (cochlea)|tectorial membrane]] and the [[reticular lamina]] of the organ of Corti, the hair bundles that link the two are deflected, which initiates mechano-electrical transduction. When the basilar membrane is driven upward, shear between the hair cells and the tectorial membrane deflects hair bundles in the excitatory direction, toward their tall edge. At the midpoint of an oscillation the hair bundles resume their resting position.  When the basilar membrane moves downward, the hair bundles are driven in the inhibitory direction.

Basilar Membrane motion causes a shearing motion between the reticular lamina and the tectorial membrane, thereby activating the mechano-sensory apparatus of the hair bundle, which in turn generates a [[receptor potential]] in the hair cells.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Thus the sound pressure wave is transduced to an electrical signal which can be processed as sound in higher parts of the [[auditory system]].{{fact|date=March 2018}}

== Skeletal Muscle ==
When a deformation is imposed on a muscle, changes in cellular and molecular conformations link the mechanical forces with biochemical signals, and the close integration of mechanical signals with electrical, metabolic, and hormonal signaling may disguise the aspect of the response that is specific to the mechanical forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17127292 |pmc=2043154 |year=2007 |last1=Burkholder |first1=TJ |title=Mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle |volume=12 |pages=174–91 |journal=Frontiers in Bioscience |doi=10.2741/2057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cartilage ==
[[File:Mechanically Gated Channel.png|thumb|Mechanically gated channel]]
One of the main mechanical functions of articular [[cartilage]] is to act as a low-friction, load-bearing surface.  Due to its unique location at joint surfaces, articular cartilage experiences a range of static and dynamic forces that include shear, compression and tension. These mechanical loads are absorbed by the cartilage [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM), where they are subsequently dissipated and transmitted to [[chondrocytes]] (cartilage cells).

[[Image:Cartilage forces.jpg|thumb|right|Cartilage experience tension, compression and shear forces in vivo]]

Chondrocytes sense and convert the mechanical signals they receive into biochemical signals, which subsequently direct and mediate both [[anabolic]] (matrix building) and [[catabolic]] (matrix degrading) processes.  These processes include the synthesis of matrix proteins ([[type II collagen]] and [[proteoglycans]]), [[proteases]], protease inhibitors, [[transcription factors]], [[cytokines]] and [[growth factors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1074/jbc.M400437200 |title=Mechanical Compression of Cartilage Explants Induces Multiple Time-dependent Gene Expression Patterns and Involves Intracellular Calcium and Cyclic AMP |year=2004 |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=J.

The balance that is struck between [[anabolic]] and [[catabolic]] processes is strongly influenced by the type of loading that cartilage experiences.  High strain rates (such as which occurs during impact loading) cause tissue damage, degradation, decreased matrix production and [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0736-0266(01)00033-X |title=Biosynthetic response and mechanical properties of articular cartilage after injurious compression |year=2001 |last1=Kurz |first1=Bodo |last2=Jin |first2=Moonsoo |last3=Patwari |first3=Parth |last4=Cheng |first4=Debbie M. |last5=Lark |first5=Michael W. |last6=Grodzinsky |first6=Alan J. |journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Research |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=1140–6 |pmid=11781016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/abbi.2000.1988 |title=Injurious Mechanical Compression of Bovine Articular Cartilage Induces Chondrocyte Apoptosis |year=2000 |last1=Loening |first1=A |journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |volume=381 |issue=2 |pages=205–12 |pmid=11032407 |last2=James |first2=IE |last3=Levenston |first3=ME |last4=Badger |first4=AM |last5=Frank |first5=EH |last6=Kurz |first6=B |last7=Nuttall |first7=ME |last8=Hung |first8=HH |last9=Blake |first9=SM }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreased mechanical loading over long periods, such as during extended bed-rest, causes a loss of matrix production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jor.1100070305 |title=Biochemical changes in articular cartilage after joint immobilization by casting or external fixation |year=1989 |last1=Behrens |first1=Fred |last2=Kraft |first2=Ellen L. |last3=Oegema |first3=Theodore R. |journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Research |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=335–43 |pmid=2703926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Static loads have been shown to be detrimental to biosynthesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10237-006-0030-5 |title=Effect of Compressive Strain on Cell Viability in Statically Loaded Articular Cartilage |year=2006 |last1=Torzilli |first1=P.

Although studies have shown that, like most biological tissues, cartilage is capable of mechanotransduction, the precise mechanisms by which this is done remain unknown.  However, there exist a few hypotheses which begin with the identification of [[mechanoreceptors]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In order for mechanical signals to be sensed, there need to be mechanoreceptors on the surface of chondrocytes.  Candidates for chondrocyte mechanoreceptors include [[stretch-activated ion channel]]s (SAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10237-006-0034-1 |title=Ion-channel Regulation of Chondrocyte Matrix Synthesis in 3D Culture Under Static and Dynamic Compression |year=2006 |last1=Mouw |first1=J.

[[Image:Chondrocyte receptors.jpg|thumb|right|Chondrocyte surface mechano-receptors include CD44, annexin V and integrins. Chondrocyte extracellular matrix components include collagens, proteoglycans (which consist of aggrecan and hyaluronan), fibronectin and COMP.]]

Using the integrin-linked mechanotransduction pathway as an example (being one of the better studied pathways), it has been shown to mediate chondrocyte adhesion to cartilage surfaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0736-0266(01)00051-1 |title=Mechanisms of chondrocyte adhesion to cartilage: Role of Î²1-integrins, CD44, and annexin V |year=2001 |last1=Kurtis |first1=Melissa S. |last2=Tu |first2=Buu P. |last3=Gaya |first3=Omar A. |last4=Mollenhauer |first4=Jürgen |last5=Knudson |first5=Warren |last6=Loeser |first6=Richard F. |last7=Knudson |first7=Cheryl B. |last8=Sah |first8=Robert L. |journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Research |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=1122–30 |pmid=11781014}}&lt;/ref&gt; mediate survival signaling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/art.10334 |title=The ?5?1 integrin provides matrix survival signals for normal and osteoarthritic human articular chondrocytes in vitro |year=2002 |last1=Pulai |first1=Judit I. |last2=Del Carlo |first2=Marcello |last3=Loeser |first3=Richard F. |journal=Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1528}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regulate matrix production and degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/1529-0131(200009)43:9&lt;2091::AID-ANR21&gt;3.0.CO;2-C |title=Mechanotransduction via integrins and interleukin–4 results in altered aggrecan and matrix metalloproteinase 3 gene expression in normal, but not osteoarthritic, human articular chondrocytes |year=2000 |last1=Millward–Sadler |first1=S.

Integrin receptors have an extracellular domain that binds to the ECM proteins (collagen, [[fibronectin]], [[laminin]], [[vitronectin]] and [[osteopontin]]), and a cytoplasmic domain that interacts with intracellular signaling molecules.  When an integrin receptor binds to its ECM ligand and is activated, additional integrins cluster around the activated site.  In addition, [[kinases]] (e.g., [[focal adhesion kinase]], FAK) and [[Signal transducing adaptor protein|adapter proteins]] (e.g., [[paxillin]], Pax, [[talin protein|talin]], Tal and [[Src homology 2 domain-containing|Shc]]) are recruited to this cluster, which is called the [[focal adhesion]] complex (FAC).  The activation of these FAC molecules in turn, triggers downstream events that up-regulate and /or down-regulate intracellular processes such as transcription factor activation and gene regulation resulting in apoptosis or differentiation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In addition to binding to ECM ligands, integrins are also receptive to [[autocrine]] and [[paracrine]] signals such as growth factors in the [[TGF-beta]] family.  Chondrocytes have been shown to secrete TGF-b, and upregulate TGF-b receptors in response to mechanical stimulation; this secretion may be a mechanism for autocrine signal amplification within the tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/B:ABME.0000017538.72511.48 |title=Integrin-Dependent Signal Cascades in Chondrocyte Mechanotransduction |year=2004 |last1=Millward-Sadler |first1=S. J. |last2=Salter |first2=D. M. |journal=Annals of Biomedical Engineering |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=435–46 |pmid=15095818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrin signaling is just one example of multiple pathways that are activated when cartilage is loaded.  Some intracellular processes that have been observed to occur within these pathways include phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and SAPK/ERK kinase-1 (SEK-1) of the JNK pathway&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1074/jbc.M305107200 |title=Mechanical Regulation of Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Signaling in Articular Cartilage |year=2003 |last1=Fanning |first1=P.

P. G. |journal=Rheumatology |volume=33 |issue=10 |pages=901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent studies have hypothesized that chondrocyte primary [[cilium]] act as a mechanoreceptor for the cell, transducing forces from the extracellular matrix into the cell.  Each chondrocyte has one cilium and it is hypothesized to transmit mechanical signals by way of bending in response to ECM loading.  Integrins have been identified on the upper shaft of the cilium, acting as anchors to the collagen matrix around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1369/jhc.5A6866.2006 |title=Localization of Extracellular Matrix Receptors on the Chondrocyte Primary Cilium |year=2006 |last1=McGlashan |first1=S. R. |journal=Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry |volume=54 |issue=9 |pages=1005–14 |pmid=16651393 |last2=Jensen |first2=CG |last3=Poole |first3=CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies published by Wann ''et al.'' in FASEB Journal have demonstrated for the first time that primary cilia are required for chondrocyte mechanotransduction. Chondrocytes derived from IFT88 mutant mice did not express primary cilia and did not show the characteristic mechanosensitive up regulation of proteoglycan synthesis seen in wild type cells&lt;ref&gt;Wann AK, Zho N, Haycraft CJ, Jensen CG, Poole CA, McGlashen SR, Knight MM (2012) FASEB J. {{PMID|22223751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to examine the mechanotransduction pathways in chondrocytes since mechanical loading conditions which represent an excessive or injuruous response upregulates synthetic activity and increases catabolic signalling cascades involving mediators such as NO and MMPs.  In addition, studies by Chowdhury TT and Agarwal S have shown that mechanical loading which represents physiological loading conditions will block the production of catabolic mediators (iNOS, COX-2, NO, PGE2) induced by inflammatory cytokines (IL-1) and restore anabolic activities. Thus an improved understanding of the interplay of biomechanics and cell signalling will help to develop therapeutic methods for blocking catabolic components of the mechanotransduction pathway.  A better understanding of the optimal levels of in vivo mechanical forces are therefore necessary for maintaining the health and viability of cartilage, preventative techniques may be devised for the prevention of cartilage degradation and disease.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

'''Metageography''' is a term used by [[Martin W. Lewis]] and [[Kären E. Wigen]]'s 1997 ''The Myth of Continents: A Critique of Metageography'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |author2=Kären E. Wigen |title=The Myth of Continents: a Critique of Metageography |year=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |ISBN=0-520-20742-4 |pages=35 |chapter= |quote= }} (hardcover; {{ISBN|0-520-20743-2}} paperback)&lt;/ref&gt;  which analyzes metageographical constructs such as "East", "West", "Europe", "Asia", "North" or "South". which they define as "the set of spatial structures through which people order their knowledge of the world" Geographies, wrote one reviewer, are thus much more than just the ways in which societies are stretched across the earth's surface. They also include the "contested, arbitrary, power-laden, and often inconsistent ways in which those structures are represented epistemologically."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africa.ufl.edu/asq/v1/4/7.htm Book review by Barney Warf, African Studies Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Martin explained: "By 'metageography' I mean the relatively unexamined and often taken-for-granted spatial frameworks through which knowledge is organized within all fields of the social sciences and humanities." He added that "the distinction between the merely geographical and the metageographical is not always clear-cut.&lt;ref&gt;Leonhardt van Efferink [http://www.exploringgeopolitics.org/interview_lewis_martin_metageographies_postmodernism_fallacy_of_unit_comparability_historical_spatial_ideological_development_constructs_taxonomy_ideas_systems/ Martin Lewis: Metageographies, postmodernism and fallacy of unit comparability] ''Exploring Geopolitics'' August 2010 (Accessed 05/01/2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was criticized by [[James M. Blaut]]: "the word metageography seems to have been coined by the authors as an impressive-sounding synonym for 'world cultural geography.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Blaut  |first =James M |authorlink = |title =The Myth of Continents: A Critique of Metageography (Review) |journal =Journal of World History |volume =10 |issue = 1 |pages =205–210 |publisher = |location = |date =1999 |language = |url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jwh/summary/v010/10.1blaut.html |jstor = |issn = |doi = 10.1353/jwh.2005.0002 |accessdate = |ref= none}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis and Wigen, however, disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Lewis, Martin W and Karen Wigen  |first = |authorlink = |title =Third Worldism or Globalism?

In 1969, Soviet geographers Gokhman, Gurevich and Saushkin wrote that "[m]etageography is concerned with study of the common basis of geographical regularities and the potentialities of geography as a science"  and argued that many factors must be taken into account in order to define geographical entities, not simply spatial ones.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Mos Teutonicus''' (Latin: ''the Germanic custom'') was a postmortem [[Funeral|funerary custom]] used in [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]] as a means of transporting, and solemnly disposing of, the bodies of high status individuals. The process involved the removal of the flesh from the body, so that the bones of the deceased could be transported hygienically from distant lands back home.

== Background ==

During the [[Second Crusade|Second Crusade for the Holy Land]] it was not thought fit for [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] who fell in battle, or died of natural causes, to be buried away from their homeland in Muslim territory.&lt;ref name= Keen&gt;{{cite book |last=Keen |first=Maurice |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=Chivalry |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |date=September 10, 1986 |pages= |chapter= |isbn= 0300033605}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transportation of the whole body back from foreign parts over long distances was impractical and unhygienic due to decomposition, which was often accelerated by the climate.

German aristocrats were particularly concerned that burial should not take place in the Holy Land, but rather on home soil.&lt;ref name=Schafer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scäfer |first1=Von Dietrich |last2= |first2= |year=1920 |title=Mittelalter Brauch by Der Überführung von Leichen |journal=Sitzungsbrichte der preussischen Akademie der Wissenschafter |volume=XXVI |issue=|pages=478–489 |publisher=Akademie der Wissenschafter |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Florence|Florentine]] chronicler [[Boncompagno da Signa|Boncompagno]] was the first to connect the procedure specifically with German aristocrats, and coins the phrase ''mos Teutonicus'', meaning ‘the Germanic custom.’{{#tag:ref|Boncompagno refers to the practice in a derogatory manner, placing ''mos Teutonicus'' in a passage with [[Jewish]] and [[Rome|Roman]] burial customs designed to preserve the dignity and honour of the body. He claims the Germans (''teutonici'') [[dismember]] the bodies of their most eminent people.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt; |group=note}}

English and French aristocrats generally preferred [[embalming]] to ''mos Teutonicus'', involving the burial of the entrails and [[heart]] in a separate location from the corpse.&lt;ref name=Westerhof&gt;{{cite book |last=Westerhof |first=Danielle |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=Death and the Noble Body in Medieval England |publisher= Boydell Press |date=October 16, 2008 |pages= |chapter= |isbn= 1843834162}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the advantages of ''mos Teutonicus'' was that it was relatively economical in comparison with embalming, and was more hygienic.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;

Corpse preservation was very popular in mediaeval society.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Elizabeth A. R. |last2= |first2= |year=1981 |title=Death and the Human Body in the Late Middle Ages: The Legislation of Boniface VIII on the division of the Corpse |journal=Viator |volume=XII |issue=|pages=223 to 270 |publisher=UCLA: Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies  |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decaying body was seen  as a representative of something sinful and evil.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;  Embalming and ''mos Teutonicus'', along with tomb effigies, were a way of giving the corpse an illusion of stasis and removed the uneasy image of putrification and decay.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;

In 1270, the body of [[Louis IX of France|King Louis IX]], who died in [[Tunis]], which was [[Muslim]] territory, was subject to the process of ''mos Teutonicus'' for its transportation back to [[France]].&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;

== Process ==

The process of ''mos Teutonicus'' began with the [[cadaver]] being [[dismembered]]&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; to facilitate the next stage in the process, in which the body parts were [[boiled]] in water or wine&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; for several hours.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt; The boiling had the effect of separating the flesh from the [[Human skeleton|bone]]. Any residual was scraped from the bones, leaving a completely clean [[skeleton]].&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt; Both the flesh and [[Viscus|internal organs]] could be buried immediately, or [[Meat preservation|preserved]] with [[salt]] in the same manner as animal meat.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; The bones, and any preserved flesh, would then be transported back to the deceased's home for ceremonial interment.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt;

Mediaeval society generally regarded entrails as ignoble&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; and there was no great solemnity attached to their disposal, especially among German aristocrats.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt;

== Prohibition of the practice ==

Although the Church had a high regard for the practice, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] was known to have an especial repugnance of ''mos Teutonicus'' because of his ideal of bodily integrity.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; In his bull of 1300, ''[[De Sepulturis]]'', Boniface forbade the practice.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt; The [[papal bull]] issued which banned this practice was often misinterpreted as prohibition against human dissection. This probably hindered the research of some anatomists as they feared repercussions and punishment as a result of medical autopsies but ''[[De Sepulturis]]'' only prohibited the act of ''mos Teutonicus,'' not dissection in general.

In many [[Unix]] variants, "'''nobody'''" is the conventional name of a [[user account]] which owns no files, is in no privileged groups, and has no abilities except those which every other user has. Some systems also define an equivalent group "'''nogroup'''".

== Uses ==

* The pseudo-user "nobody" and group "nogroup" are used, for example, in the [[NFSv4]] implementation of Linux by [[idmapd]], if a user or group name in an incoming packet does not match any known username on the system.
* It was once common to run [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]]s as ''nobody'', especially [[server (computing)|server]]s, in order to limit the damage that could be done by a malicious user who gained control of them. However, the usefulness of this technique is reduced if more than one daemon is run like this, because then gaining control of one daemon would provide control of them all. The reason is that processes owned by the same user have the ability to send signals to each other and use [[debugging]] facilities to read or even modify each other's memory.  Modern practice, as recommended by the [[Linux Standard Base]], is to provide better security isolation by creating a separate user account for each daemon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Linux Standard Base]], [http://refspecs.linux-foundation.org/LSB_3.1.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/usernames.html Core Specification 3.1 section 21.2: User &amp; Group Names], linux-foundation.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pepperwood Preserve''' is a 3,117 acre plot of land owned by the Pepperwood Foundation, located in the [[Mayacamas Mountains]] in the coast ranges of California near the towns of [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]] and [[Healdsburg]] in [[Sonoma County]]. The preserve includes the headwaters of Mark West Creek, Franz Creek, and Brooks Creek all of which feed into the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]]. The highest point on the preserve is 1,560 feet.

==Management==

The [[California Academy of Science]] sold the preserve in 2005 to Healdsburg residents Herb and Jane Dwight, who sit on the five-member Pepperwood Foundation board of directors and have donated over $20 million for land and facilities at the preserve.  Herb Dwight is the former CEO of Optical Coating Laboratory in Santa Rosa.  The facilities include a $9 million, 9,400 square foot, solar-powered center for environmental research and education.  The preserve has an agreement with [[Santa Rosa Junior College and Sonoma State University]] to use the site for field studies.  Lisa Micheli, with a Ph.D. in geomorphology, was hired as executive director in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Climate==
Pepperwood has a Mediterranean climate that includes cool wet winters (Nov-Apr) and hot dry summers (May-Oct). Streams are intermittent. During the wet winter, standing water can be found in numerous small ponds.

==Geological history==
Pepperwood's geology is complex with exposures of Glen Ellen sediments, Sonoma volcanics and Franciscan metamorphics. There are several areas with serpentine soils.

==Vegetation==
Pepperwood includes redwood and Douglas-fir forests on mesic sites and grassland, woodland, and chaparral on xeric sites. Wetlands are composed of riparian forests, springs, marshes, ponds, and vernal pools.

The '''Pitlochry fish ladder''' is a [[fish ladder]] next to the Pitlochry Power Station on the  [[River Tummel]] near [[Pitlochry]], [[Perth and Kinross]], [[Scotland]] that allows [[salmon]] to travel upstream during the breeding season. 

== Construction details ==
The ladder was constructed as a result of a 1943 [[Act of Parliament]] which laid a duty of care on the [[North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board]] to preserve fish stocks in the waterways encompassing its power schemes. The form and design were created by the fish biologist [[John Berry (zoologist)|John Berry]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/berry_john.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It was completed in 1951 alongside the dam for the [[hydro-electric]] power station as part of the [[Tummel Hydro-Electric Power Scheme]] and was installed in 1952. It was the first of its type in Scotland.&lt;ref name="SNH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/commissioned_reports/F01NB02.pdf|title=Trends in Atlantic salmon: the role of automatic fish counter data in their recording
|author=Eatherley, D.M.R., Thorley, J.L., Stephen, A.B., Simpson, I., MacLean, J.C. &amp; Youngson, A.F|publisher=Scottish Natural Heritage|date=2005|accessdate=6 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fish ladder consists of 34 separate pools, each {{convert|50|cm|ft}} higher than the last and covering a distance of {{convert|310|m|yd}}.&lt;ref name="PL1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst8993.html |title=Pitlochry Fish Ladder|author=|publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland|date=|accessdate=6 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each pool has a {{convert|1|m|adj=on}} opening below the water level to allow the fish to pass to the next pool; a continuous flow of water maintains the water level in the pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| people =|date =2006| title =Countryfile| url =| medium = Television series| location =| publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three larger pools which allow the fish to rest during their ascent, and one of these has an underwater viewing area with a glass wall and CCTV cameras to allow the public to observe the fish making their climb during the breeding season. The ladder is equipped with a [[fish counter]] which allows the number of fish making the journey each year to be recorded. In 2006, 7,238 fish were recorded travelling up the ladder.&lt;ref name="PAC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitlochryanglingclub.co.uk/news.html|title=News: 2006 Salmon Season|author=|publisher=Pitlochry Angling Club|date=2006|accessdate=6 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total to date for 2016 as of September 13 was 6098 fish. The 2006 figure, and 2016 figures, are relatively high, when taken in context with the counts since 1980. An average figure has been nearer to 4000 fish, looking at the Tay District Salmon Fisheries Board report of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tdsfb.org/images/AnnualReport2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The dam across the River Tummel at Pitlochry (that led to the formation of [[Loch Faskally]]) was constructed between 1947 and 1950 as part of the Board's Tummel Hydro-Electric Power Scheme. Without the fish ladder it would have been an impassable obstacle for the migrating salmon.&lt;ref name="PL1" /&gt;

The term '''postfeminism''' (alternatively rendered as '''post-feminism''') is used to describe reactions against contradictions and absences in [[feminism]], especially [[second-wave feminism]] and [[third-wave feminism]]. The term ''postfeminism'' is sometimes confused with subsequent feminisms such as [[Fourth-wave feminism|4th wave-feminism]], and "women of color feminism" (e.g. hooks, 1996; Spivak, 1999).

The ideology of postfeminism is recognized by its contrast with prevailing or preceding feminism. Postfeminism strives towards the next stage in gender-related progress, and as such is often conceived as in favor of a society that is no longer defined by [[gender binary]] and [[gender role]]s. A postfeminist is a person who believes in, promotes, or embodies any of various ideologies springing from the feminism of the 1970s, whether supportive of or antagonistic towards classical feminism.

Postfeminism can be considered a critical way of understanding the changed relations between feminism, [[popular culture]] and [[femininity]]. Postfeminism may also present a critique of second-wave feminism or third-wave feminism by questioning their binary thinking and essentialism, their vision of sexuality, and their perception of relationships between femininity and feminism. It may also complicate or even deny entirely the notion that absolute gender equality is necessary, desirable or realistically achievable.

Second-wave feminism is often critiqued for being too "white", too "straight", and too "liberal", thus resulting in the needs of women from marginalized groups and cultures being ignored. However, since [[intersectionality]] is a product of third-wave feminism, the references to such as postfeminist are open to challenge and may be more properly considered feminist.

==History of the term==
While ''postfeminism'' was first used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, it is now used as a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.  It may also be used to invoke the view that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gender.cawater-info.net/knowledge_base/rubricator/feminism_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the meaning of postfeminism has broadened in scope, encompassing many different meanings, as is the case with feminism. Within feminist literature, definitions tend to fall into two main categories: 1) “death of feminism”, “anti-feminism”, “feminism is irrelevant now” and 2) the next stage in feminism, or feminism that intersects with other “post-” philosophies/theories, such as [[postmodernism]], [[post-structuralism]] and [[postcolonialism]].

In 1919, a journal was launched in which "female literary radicals" stated "'we're interested in people now—not in men and women'", that "moral, social, economic, and political standards 'should not have anything to do with sex'", that it would "be 'pro-woman without being anti-man'", and that "their stance [is called] 'post-feminist'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy F. Cott|Cott, Nancy F.]], ''The Grounding of Modern Feminism'' (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, [2d printing?] pbk 1987 ({{ISBN|0-300-04228-0}})) (cloth {{ISBN|0-300-03892-5}}), p. 282 (author prof. American studies &amp; history, Yale Univ.) (book is largely on U.S. feminism in 1910s–1920s) (n. 23 (at end) omitted) (n. 23 (in full): "23. ''Judy'' 1:1 (Jun. 1919); 2:3 (1919), n.p., SL." ("SL" in small capitals &amp; abbreviating "The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts", per ''id.'', p. 285 (Abbreviations Used in Notes (Libraries)))).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against [[second-wave feminism]]. Postfeminism is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;Wright, Elizabeth, ''Lacan and Postfeminism'' (Icon Books, 2000), {{ISBN|978-1-84046-182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other postfeminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;Modleski, Tania. Feminism without Women: Culture and Criticism in a "Postfeminist" Age. New York: Routledge, 1991, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amelia Jones]] has written that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and were overly generalizing in their criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Amelia. "Postfeminism, Feminist Pleasures, and Embodied Theories of Art," New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action, Eds. Joana Frueh, Cassandra L. Langer and Arlene Raven. New York: HarperCollins, 1994. 16–41, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s saw the popularization of this term, in both the academic world as well as the media world. It was seen as a term of both commendation and scorn. [[Toril Moi]], a professor at Duke University, originally coined the term in 1985 in Sexual/Textual politics to advocate a feminism that would deconstruct the binary between equality based on "liberal" feminism and difference-based or "radical" feminism. There is confusion surrounding the intended meaning of "post" in the context of "postfeminism". This confusion has plagued the very meaning of "postfeminism" since the 1990s. While the term has seemed on the one hand to announce the end of feminism, on the other hand it has itself become a site of feminist politics.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 4149214|title = Feminism, Ethics, and History, or What is the "Post" in Postfeminism?|journal = Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 29–44|last1 = Kavka|first1 = Misha|year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, feminist history is characterized by the struggle to find out the present situation—often articulated as a concern about whether there is still such a thing called "feminism"—by writing in the past. It is here that the meaning of "post" as a historical break is troubling, for "post" offers to situate feminism in history by proclaiming the end of this history. It then confirms feminist history as a thing of the past. However, some claim that it is impossible that feminism could be aligned with "post" when it is unthinkable, as it would be the same as calling the current world a post racist, post-classist, and post-sexist society.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

==Characteristics==

The early part of the 1980s was when the media began labeling teenage women and women in their twenties the "postfeminist generation". After twenty years, the term postfeminist is still used to refer to young women, "who are thought to benefit from the women's movement through expanded access to employment and education and new family arrangements but at the same time do not push for further political change", Pamela Aronson, Professor of Sociology, asserts. Postfeminism is a highly debated topic since it implies that feminism is "dead" and "because the equality it assumes is largely a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Feminists or "Postfeminists"?: Young Women's Attitudes toward Feminism and Gender Relations | journal = Gender and Society | year = 2003 | first = Pamela | last = Aronson | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 903–22 | doi=10.1177/0891243203257145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Diane Davis|Prof. D. Diane Davis]], postfeminism is just a continuation of what first- and second-wave feminisms want.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Debra Diane, ''Breaking Up [at] Totality: A Rhetoric of Laughter'' (Carbondale: Southern Ill. Univ. Press, 2000 ({{ISBN|0-8093-2228-5}})), p. 141 n. 8 (brackets in title so in original) (author asst. prof. rhetoric, Univ. of Iowa).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted at Kent State University narrowed postfeminism to four main claims: support for feminism declined; women began hating feminism and feminists; society had already attained social equality, thus making feminism outdated; and the label "feminist" was disliked due to negative stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Elaine J.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Marnie Salupo|date=2003|title=The Myth of Postfeminism|jstor=3594675|journal=Gender and Society|volume=17|issue=6|pages=878–902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PPp7dfrNTroC&amp;pg=PP1#v=snippet&amp;q=rodriguez&amp;f=false|title=An Introduction to Sociology: Feminist Perspectives|last=Abbott|first=Pamela|last2=Tyler|first2=Melissa|last3=Wallace|first3=Claire|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=9781134382453|location=|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of postfeminist work==

In her 1994 book ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] considers much of modern academic [[feminist theory]] and the feminist movement to be [[gynocentrism|gynocentric]]. She labels this "[[gender feminism]]" and proposes "[[equity feminism]]"—an ideology that aims for full civil and legal equality. She argues that while the feminists she designates as gender feminists advocate preferential treatment and portray women as victims, equity feminism provides a viable alternative form of feminism.&lt;ref name=Hoff_Sommers&gt;Hoff Sommers, Christina, Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptions and her other work have caused Hoff Sommers to be described as an antifeminist by some other feminists.&lt;ref name=Flood&gt;Flood, Michael (7 July 2004). "Backlash: Angry men's movements", in Stacey Elin Rossi, ed.: The Battle and Backlash Rage On. N.p.: XLibris, 273. {{ISBN|1-4134-5934-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Uncovering the Right—Female Anti-Feminism for Fame and Profit |url=http://organizenow.net/cco/right/antifem.html |accessdate=2007-12-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071215141226/http://www.organizenow.net/cco/right/antifem.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary feminists, such as [[Katha Pollitt]] or [[Nadine Strossen]], consider feminism to hold simply that "women are people." Views that separate the sexes rather than unite them are considered by these writers to be ''sexist'' rather than ''feminist''.&lt;ref name=Pollitt&gt;Pollitt, Katha, ''Reasonable Creatures: Essays on Women and Feminism '' (Vintage, 1995) {{ISBN|978-0-679-76278-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strossen&gt;Strossen, Nadine, ''Defending Pornography: Free Speech, Sex, and the Fight for Women's Rights'' (Prentice Hall &amp; IBD, 1995), {{ISBN|978-0-684-19749-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amelia Jones]] has authored post-feminist texts which emerged in the 1980s/1990s and portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and criticized it using generalizations.

One of the earliest modern uses of the term was in Susan Bolotin's 1982 article "Voices of the Post-Feminist Generation", published in ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''. This article was based on a number of interviews with women who largely agreed with the goals of feminism, but did not identify as feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Ruth. The World Split Open: How the Modern Women's Movement Changed America. New York: Viking, 2000, 275, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Faludi]], in her 1991 book ''[[Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women]]'', argued that a backlash against second wave feminism in the 1980s had successfully re-defined feminism through its terms. She argued that it constructed the [[women's liberation movement]] as the source of many of the problems alleged to be plaguing women in the late 1980s. She also argued that many of these problems were illusory, constructed by the media without reliable evidence. According to her, this type of backlash is a historical trend, recurring when it appeared that women had made substantial gains in their efforts to obtain equal rights.&lt;ref name=Faludi_Backlash&gt;Faludi, Susan, ''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women'' (Three Rivers Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Angela McRobbie]] argued that adding the prefix ''post-'' to ''feminism'' undermined the strides that feminism made in achieving equality for everyone, including women. In McRobbie's opinion, postfeminism gave the impression that equality has been achieved and feminists could now focus on something else entirely. McRobbie believed that postfeminism was most clearly seen on so-called feminist media products, such as ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]], [[Sex and the City]]'', and ''[[Ally McBeal]]''. Female characters like Bridget Jones and [[Carrie Bradshaw]] claimed to be liberated and clearly enjoy their sexuality, but what they were constantly searching for was the one man who would make everything worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = McRobbie | first = Angela | author-link = Angela McRobbie | title = Post‐feminism and popular culture | journal = [[Feminist Media Studies]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 255&amp;ndash;264 | doi = 10.1080/1468077042000309937 | date = 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representations of post feminism can be found in pop culture. Postfeminism has been seen in media as a form of feminism that accepts popular culture instead of rejecting it, as was typical with second wave feminists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feasey|first=Rebecca|date=7 August 2010|title=Charmed: Why Teen Television Appeals to Women|journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television|volume=34:1|pages=2–9|doi=10.3200/JPFT.34.1.2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many popular shows from the 90s and early 2000s are considered to be postfeminist works because they tend to focus on women who are empowered by popular cultural representations of other women. Because of this, postfeminists claimed that such media was more accessible and inclusive than past representations of women in the media; however, some feminists believe that postfeminist works focus too much on white, middle-class women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such shows and movies include ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]], [[Xena: Warrior Princess]], [[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]],'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].'' Another example is ''Sex and the City''. Carrie Bradshaw from ''Sex and the City'' is an example of a character living a post feminist life. While her character attempts to live a sexually liberated lifestyle, Bradshaw is stuck endlessly pursuing the love and validation of a man. The balance between Bradshaw's independent life as a successful columnist and desire to find a husband exemplifies the tension of post feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerhard|first=Jane|date=August 2006|title=Sex and the City, Feminist Media Studies|url=|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=5|pages=37–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these works also involve women monitoring their appearance as a form of self-management, be it in the form of dieting, exercise, or—most popularly—makeover scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://politicsandculture.org/2009/11/09/post-feminism-in-popular-culture-a-potential-for-critical-resistance/|title=Post feminism in popular culture: A potential for critical resistance?|date=2009-11-09|work=Politics and Culture|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postfeminist literature—also known as [[Chick lit|chicklit]]—has been criticized by feminists for similar themes and notions. However, the genre is also praised for being confident, witty, and complicated, bringing in feminist themes, revolving around women, and reinventing standards of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/writingpostfeminism/gutsy|title=What is chick-lit? {{!}} Electronic Book Review|website=www.electronicbookreview.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples can also be found in ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]''. The novels explore the complexity of girlhood in a society that assumes gender equality, which is in line with postfeminism. The constant surveillance and self policing of the series' protagonists depicts the performance of heterosexuality, hyperfemininity, and critical gaze forced upon girls. The materialism and performance from the girls in ''Pretty Little Liars'' critiques the notion that society has full gender equality, and thus offers a critique of postfeminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitney|first1=Sarah|title=Kisses, Bitches: Pretty Little Liars Frames Postfeminism's Adolescent Girl|journal=Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature|date=11 November 2017|volume=36|issue=2|pages=353–377|doi=10.1353/tsw.2017.0026|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/677146|language=en|issn=1936-1645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article on print jewelry advertisements in Singapore, Michelle Lazar analyses how the construction of 'postfeminist' femininity has given rise to a [[neo-liberal]] hybrid "pronounced sense of self or 'I-dentity'". She states that the increasing number of female wage earners has led to advertisers updating their image of women but that "through this hybrid postfeminist I-dentity, advertisers have found a way to reinstall a new normativity that coexists with the status quo".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lazar | first = Michelle | title = Recuperating feminism, reclaiming femininity: Hybrid postfeminist I-dentity in consumer advertisements | journal = [[Gender and Language]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–224 | doi = 10.1558/genl.v8i2.205 | year = 2014 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postfeminist ads and fashion have been criticized for using femininity as a commodity veiled as liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanaejournal.hu/vol7no2/kulcsar|title=AMERICANA: "A Critique of Post-feminism" by Zsófia Kulcsár|website=americanaejournal.hu|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rent regulation''' is a system of [[law]]s, administered by a court or a public authority, which aim to ensure the affordability of housing and [[Tenancy|tenancies]] on the rental market for dwellings. Generally, a system of rent regulation involves:

*[[price controls]] (limits on the rent that a landlord may charge, typically called '''rent control''' or '''rent stabilization''')
*[[eviction]] controls: codified standards by which a landlord may terminate a tenancy{{ r | MB_Law | p=1 | q=Rent Control Laws cannot exist without a coinciding Eviction Control ordinance. The reason being is that if a landlord has a tenant in a rent controlled unit who is paying below market rent, he/she is financially motivated to simply evict the tenant and reset the rent to market rate under the Costa Hawkins Act. Therefore Eviction Control is necessary in order to preserve Rent Controlled tenancies. }} {{ r | SFChronicle_RC_1 | p=1 | q=If a city only limited rent increases, landlords could simply evict tenants when their lease is up and charge the next one market rates.  Two state laws place some limits on both rent control and eviction control. The Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act exempts multifamily apartments built after 1 February 1995 — and all single-family homes and condos, whenever built — from limits on rent increases. Costa-Hawkins does not prevent cities from imposing eviction controls on any type of rental housing — including single-family homes and apartments of any age. [This source and quote is included to clarify the difference between rent control and eviction control, and that eviction control laws can (and do) exist separately from and without rent control laws, whereas the converse is not true.] }}
*obligations on the landlord or tenant regarding adequate maintenance of the property
*a system of oversight and enforcement by an independent regulator and [[Ombudsman]]

The classic objective is to limit the price that would result from the [[free market]].  The loose term "rent control" can apply to several types of price control:
* "strict price ceilings", also known as "'''rent freeze'''" systems, or "'''absolute'''" or "'''first generation'''" rent controls, in which no increases in rent are allowed at all (rent is typically frozen at the rate existing when the law was enacted) 
* "vacancy control", also known as "'''strict'''" or "'''strong'''" rent control, in which the rental price can rise, but continues to be regulated in between tenancies (a new [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] pays almost the same rent as the previous tenant) and 
* "vacancy decontrol", also known as "'''tenancy'''" or "'''second-generation'''" rent control, which limits price increases during a tenancy, but allows rents to rise to market rate between tenancies (new tenants pay market rate rent, but increases are limited as long as they remain).{{ r | GPG }} 

As of 2016, at least 14 of the 36 [[OECD]] countries have some form of rent control in effect,{{ r | OECD_RC }} including four states in the [[United States]].{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }} 

A 2009 review of the economic literature{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review | p=106 | q=If rent-control is such a “no-brainer,” why bother to scrutinize the literature? The cluster of restrictions persists in roughly 140 jurisdictions in the United States as of 2001. As Hazlett (1982) notes, “economists have been notoriously thorough in convincing themselves of the destructive effects of rent control and notoriously inept at convincing anyone else” (278). Better understanding of the issue might help correct the error, prevent other governments from falling into it, and promote an understanding among more than just economists. Also, better understanding is an end in itself. }} by Blair Jenkins through [[EconLit]] covering theoretical and empirical research on multiple aspects of the issue, including housing availability, maintenance and housing quality, rental rates, political and administrative costs, and redistribution, for both first generation and second generation rent control systems, found that “the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves”.{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review | p=105 | q=My review of the rent-control literature indexed by EconLit (or cited by such indexed articles) finds that economic research quite consistently and predominantly frowns on rent control. ... As Navarro (1985) notes, “the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves” (90). }} {{ r | 2012_Urban_Inst | p=1 | q=In a comprehensive overview of the research literature, Blair Jenkins examined studies of different aspects of first-generation rent control (strict price ceilings) and second-generation (limits on increases, also referred to as rent stabilization). The upshot is that, at best, rent control does little harm but probably not much good and, at worst, it has negative impacts on landlords and tenants.  There is near universal agreement that strict price ceilings, such as the kind imposed in New York City in the 1940s, are always bad because they severely inhibit housing production and investment. Even those most sympathetic to rent control seem to agree with this. }} {{ r | Forbes_RC_cities | p=1 | q=Bad ideas die hard, and rent control is no exception. For several decades, there has been near-consensus [the author links to the Blair Jenkins study on the words "near-consensus"] among economists that laws which cap or regulate rents are counterproductive, and most cities have ended them. }} {{ r | Forbes_RC_Valdez | p=1 | q=Rent control is one of those policies that feels good—who doesn’t want to set price by fiat (I only want to pay $3.00 for this sandwich)—but it is fundamentally flawed. It has been a few years now, but Blair Jenkins has written a review of the economics literature and quotes an economist who says, “the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves” }}  

==Current law==
===Canada===
{{main|Rent regulation in Canada|Rent control in Ontario}}
In Canada, there are rent regulation laws in each province. For example, in [[Ontario]] the [[Residential Tenancies Act 2006]] requires that prices for rented properties do not rise more than 2.5 percent each year, or a lower figure fixed by a government minister.

===Germany===

Tenants may be evicted against their will through a court procedure for a good reason, and in the normal case only with a minimum of three months' notice.&lt;ref&gt;BGB [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p2227 §573c]&lt;/ref&gt; Tenants receive unlimited duration of their rental agreement unless the duration is explicitly halted. In practice, landlords have little incentive to change tenants as rental price increases beyond inflation are constrained. During the period of the tenancy, a person's tenancy may only be terminated for very good reasons. A system of rights for the rental property to be maintained by the landlord is designed to ensure quality of housing. Many states, such as [[Berlin]], have a constitutional right to adequate housing, and require buildings to make dwelling spaces of a certain size and ceiling height.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Rent regulation covered the whole of the UK private sector rental market from 1915 to 1980. However, from the [[Housing Act 1980]], it became the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]'s policy to deregulate and dismantle rent regulation. Regulation for all new tenancies was abolished by the [[Housing Act 1988]], leaving the basic regulatory framework was "[[freedom of contract]]" by the landlord to set any price. Rent regulations survive among a small number of [[council house]]s, and often the rates set by local authorities mirror escalating prices in the non-regulated private market.

===United States===

Rent regulation in the [[United States]] is an issue for each state. In 1921, the [[US supreme court|US Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Block v. Hirsh]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|256|135|1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; held by a majority that regulation of rents in the District of Columbia as a temporary emergency measure was constitutional, but shortly afterwards in 1924 in ''[[Chastleton Corp v. Sinclair]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|264|543|1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same law was unanimously struck down by the Supreme Court.  After the 1930s [[New Deal]], the Supreme Court ceased to interfere with social and economic legislation, and a number of states adopted rules.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The application was often inconsistent. For example, in [[New York City]], almost half of property units continue to have the protection of rent regulation, while other units on the private market are left to be priced according to what the market will bear.&lt;ref name="SB"&gt; {{ cite web | last=Beyer | first=Scott | date=24 April 2015 | title=How Ironic: America's Rent-Controlled Cities Are Its Least Affordable | publisher=''[[Forbes]]'' | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2015/04/24/how-ironic-americas-rent-controlled-cities-are-its-least-affordable/ |accessdate=12 June 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501001409/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2015/04/24/how-ironic-americas-rent-controlled-cities-are-its-least-affordable/ | archive-date=2015-05-01 | dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1986 case of ''[[Fisher v. City of Berkeley]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|475|260|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the US Supreme court held that there was no incompatibility between rent control and the [[Sherman Act]].

As of 2018, four states ([[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Maryland]]) and the [[District of Columbia]] have localities in which some form of residential rent control is in effect (for normal structures, excluding [[Mobile home|mobile homes]]).{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}  Thirty-seven states either prohibit or preempt rent control, while nine states allow their cities to enact rent control, but have no cities that have implemented it.{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}

{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|align=right|salign=right|quote="As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the forest, the grass of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which, when land was in common, cost the labourer only the trouble of gathering them, come, even to him, to have an additional price fixed upon them. He must then pay for the licence to gather them; and must give up to the landlord a portion of what his labour either collects or produces. This portion, or, what comes to the same thing, the price of this portion, constitutes the rent of land ...."

Rent price controls remain the most controversial element of a system of rent regulation. Historically, economists such as [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]] viewed landlords as producing very little that was valuable, and so regarded "rents" as an exploitative concept.{{Citation needed|reason=Did Adam Smith really think that rent is "exploitative"? This should be proven.|date=January 2017}} (Economists note that the [[land value tax]] is a way to capture this un-earned value.)&lt;ref name=Economist_LVT &gt; {{ cite web | url=https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/08/09/the-time-may-be-right-for-land-value-taxes | doi= | title=The time may be right for land-value taxes - Beloved of liberals and economists, they have so far never caught on | last= | first= | publisher=''[[The Economist]]'' | date=2018-08-09 | accessdate=2018-09-09 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827011448/https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/08/09/the-time-may-be-right-for-land-value-taxes | archive-date=2018-08-27 | dead-url=no | pages= | quote=&lt;blockquote&gt;  Taxes on land have long had a magnetic attraction for liberals and economists. ... One of George’s arguments for confiscating land rents was that landlords do not deserve the gains they accrue when others invest in an area. This was echoed by Winston Churchill, then a Liberal, in support of the “people’s budget”. “Roads are made, streets are made, services are improved, electric light turns night into day, water is brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains—and all the while the landlord sits still,” he thundered. The argument emphasises the potential for landowners to benefit at the taxpayer’s expense. There is lots of evidence that local house prices rise when taxpayers provide, say, better transport links. &lt;/blockquote&gt; }} &lt;/ref&gt;  Modern rent controls (sometimes called rent leveling or rent stabilization) are intended to protect tenants in privately owned residential properties from excessive rent increases by mandating gradual rent increases, while at the same time ensuring that landlords receive a return on their investment that is deemed fair by the controlling authority (which might, or might not be a legislature).

It is argued by most economists, including a number of neo-classical and [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] economists&lt;ref&gt;C Rapkin,''The Private Rental Housing Market in New York City'' (1966) and G Sternlieb, ''The Urban Housing Dilemma'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; that some forms of rent control regulations create shortages and exacerbate scarcity in the housing market by discouraging private investment in the rental market.{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review}}{{ r | SJMN_RC_new_housing | p=1 }} This analysis targeted nominal rent freezes, and the studies conducted were mainly focused on rental prices in Manhattan, or elsewhere in the United States.

The Swedish economist [[Assar Lindbeck]], a housing expert, says that "rent control appears to be the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city – except for bombing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/10802231/Low-rent-Labour-is-positioning-itself-as-the-Ukip-of-the-Left.html|title=Low-rent Labour is positioning itself as the Ukip of the Left|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|author=[[Fraser Nelson]]|date=2 May 2014|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economists' views==
In a 1992 [[Stratified sampling|stratified]], random survey of 464 US economists, economics [[graduate school|graduate students]], and members of the [[American Economic Association]], 93% "generally agreed" or "agreed with [[wikt:proviso|provisos]]" that "A ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing available."{{ r | 1992_poll | p=204 | q=76.3% generally agreed, 16.6% agreed but with provisos }} {{ r | Krugman_NYT | p=1 | q=The analysis of rent control is among the best-understood issues in all of economics, and -- among economists, anyway -- one of the least controversial. In 1992 a poll of the American Economic Association found 93 percent of its members agreeing that "a ceiling on rents reduces the quality and quantity of housing." }}

A 2009 review of the economic literature{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review | p=106 | q=If rent-control is such a “no-brainer,” why bother to scrutinize the literature? The cluster of restrictions persists in roughly 140 jurisdictions in the United States as of 2001. As Hazlett (1982) notes, “economists have been notoriously thorough in convincing themselves of the destructive effects of rent control and notoriously inept at convincing anyone else” (278). Better understanding of the issue might help correct the error, prevent other governments from falling into it, and promote an understanding among more than just economists. Also, better understanding is an end in itself. }} by Blair Jenkins through [[EconLit]] covering theoretical and empirical research on multiple aspects of the issue, including housing availability, maintenance and housing quality, rental rates, political and administrative costs, and redistribution, for both first generation and second generation rent control systems, found that “the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves”.{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review | p=105 | q=My review of the rent-control literature indexed by EconLit (or cited by such indexed articles) finds that economic research quite consistently and predominantly frowns on rent control. ... As Navarro (1985) notes, “the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves” (90). }} {{ r | 2012_Urban_Inst | p=1 | q=In a comprehensive overview of the research literature, Blair Jenkins examined studies of different aspects of first-generation rent control (strict price ceilings) and second-generation (limits on increases, also referred to as rent stabilization). The upshot is that, at best, rent control does little harm but probably not much good and, at worst, it has negative impacts on landlords and tenants.  There is near universal agreement that strict price ceilings, such as the kind imposed in New York City in the 1940s, are always bad because they severely inhibit housing production and investment. Even those most sympathetic to rent control seem to agree with this. }} {{ r | Forbes_RC_cities | p=1 | q=Bad ideas die hard, and rent control is no exception. For several decades, there has been near-consensus [the author links to the Blair Jenkins study on the words "near-consensus"] among economists that laws which cap or regulate rents are counterproductive, and most cities have ended them. }} {{ r | Forbes_RC_Valdez | p=1 | q=Rent control is one of those policies that feels good—who doesn’t want to set price by fiat (I only want to pay $3.00 for this sandwich)—but it is fundamentally flawed. It has been a few years now, but Blair Jenkins has written a review of the economics literature and quotes an economist who says, “the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves” }}

In a 2012 poll of the 41 members of the [[Initiative on Global Markets]] (IGM) Economic Experts Panel, only one member agreed with the following statement: "Local ordinances that limit rent increases for some rental housing units, such as in New York and San Francisco, have had a positive impact over the past three decades on the amount and quality of broadly affordable rental housing in cities that have used them."  (13 "strongly disagreed", 20 "disagreed", 1 "agreed", and 7 either did not answer, were undecided, or had no opinion.){{ r | 2012_IGM }} {{ r | SFChronicle_RC_1 | p=1 | q=A 2012 survey by the University of Chicago&amp;apos;s Booth School of Business asked respected economists if they agreed that rent-control ordinances in cities such as New York and San Francisco have improved the quantity and quality of affordable rental housing over the past three decades. Eighty-one percent disagreed, 2 percent agreed and 9 percent were uncertain or had no opinion. }} {{ r | WaPo_Econ_quiz | p=1 | q=The findings of consensus are usually predictable. Economists, sure enough, hate rent control, [In this article, the author hyperlinks to the 2012 Chicago poll on the words rent contol.] licensing requirements and the gold standard, love free trade (including with China), high-skilled immigration, congestion pricing and carbon taxes, and think the Laffer curve is a bunch of baloney. Other answers are more surprising. The panelists lean toward supporting tougher capital requirements on big banks and backing the 2009 stimulus package, and, by a wide margin, back increasing the minimum wage to $9 an hour and indexing it to inflation. The results don&amp;apos;t always map easily onto U.S. political divides. }}

What, then, should be done to help renters obtain affordable, decent housing? A better approach may be adopting policies that encourage the production of more diverse types of housing (different densities, tenure types, unit sizes, etc.), implementing strong regulations and practices to ensure housing quality and to protect tenants from abuses; and providing targeted, direct subsidies to people who need help paying their rents. }} {{ r | SFChronicle_RC_1 | p=1 | q=In 2013, Peter Tatian of the Urban Institute reviewed academic research on rent control and found “very little evidence that rent control is a good policy.” }} {{ r | CityLab_RC_NYC | p=1 | q=Then again, as Peter Tatian of the Urban Institute recently wrote here, [the author hyperlinks to the Peter Tatian analysis on the words "recently wrote here"] there&amp;apos;s "very little evidence that rent control is good policy." Studies have found that landlords with rent-controlled units often inflate the rent on other units to make up the loss, and that rent-stabilization programs don&amp;apos;t do a great job targeting the poor residents they&amp;apos;re supposed to protect. }}

Two economists from opposing sides of the political spectrum, [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Paul Krugman]] (who identifies as an American liberal or European [[social democrat]]),&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR1FpbMkZ58 "Nobelpristagaren i ekonomi 2008: Paul Krugman"], speech by Paul Krugman (Retrieved December 26, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Sowell]], (who stated that "[[Libertarianism|libertarian]]" might best describe his views){{ r | Sowell_Salon | p=1 | q=What would your preferred label be? I prefer not to have labels, but I suspect that "libertarian" would suit me better than many others, }} have both criticized rent regulation as poor economics, which, despite its good intentions, leads to the creation of less housing and housing shortages.{{ r | Krugman_NYT | p=1 | q=Sky-high rents on uncontrolled apartments, because desperate renters have nowhere to go -- and the absence of new apartment construction, despite those high rents, because landlords fear that controls will be extended?

Almost invariably, landlords and builders of housing find the reduced range of terms less acceptable and therefore supply less housing. ... In other words, while landlords and builders simply lost an opportunity to make as much money as they could have otherwise, many tenants lost an opportunity to find a decent place to live. }}  Krugman also notes that rent control creates bitter tenant-landlord relations,{{ r | Krugman_NYT | p=1 | q=Bitter relations between tenants and landlords, with an arms race between ever-more ingenious strategies to force tenants out -- what yesterday&amp;apos;s article oddly described as &amp;apos;free-market horror stories&amp;apos; -- and constantly proliferating regulations designed to block those strategies?

No, I&amp;apos;m not. A figure I ran across recently that struck me as illustrating the moral bankruptcy of rent control is this: The number of boarded-up housing units in New York City is four times the number of homeless people on the streets. To think of that! On winter nights there are people sleeping on the cold pavement and dying of exposure, when there are these buildings that are boarded up as a consequence of economic protectionism. }}

In a [[computer system]] or [[computer network|network]], a '''runbook''' is a compilation of routine procedures and operations that the system administrator or operator carries out. [[System administrator]]s in [[Information technology|IT]] departments and [[Network Operations Center|NOCs]] use runbooks as a reference. Runbooks can be in either electronic or in physical book form. Typically, a runbook contains procedures to begin, stop, supervise, and debug the system. It may also describe procedures for handling special requests and contingencies. An effective runbook allows other operators, with prerequisite expertise, to effectively manage and troubleshoot a system. Through runbook automation, these processes can be carried out using software tools in a predetermined manner.

==Runbook applied to operations==
Operational runbooks may be tied to IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) incidents to allow repeatable processes supporting specific aspects of the [[service catalog]].&lt;ref name=AllView&gt;{{cite web|last=Krapohl|first=Don|title=An Integrated Approach to Organizational Transformation|url=http://www.augmentedintel.com/wordpress/index.php/integrated-approach-to-organizational-transformation/|work=AugmentedIntel|publisher=Don Krapohl|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The runbook is typically divided into routine automated processes and routine manual processes.  The runbook catalog begins with an index of processes covered and may be broken down in [[outline (list)|outline]] form to align the processes to the major elements they support in the service catalog. A runbook is a compilation of routine procedures and operations that the system administrator or operator carries out.

==Runbook automation==

'''Runbook automation''' ('''RBA''') is the ability to define, build, orchestrate, manage, and report on [[workflow]]s that support system and network operational processes. A runbook workflow can potentially interact with all types of infrastructure elements, such as [[application software|applications]], [[database]]s, and hardware.

According to [[Gartner]], the growth of RBA has coincided with the need for IT operations executives to enhance IT operations efficiency measures—including reducing [[mean time to repair]] (MTTR), increasing [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF), and automating the provisioning of [[information technology|IT]] resources. In addition, it is necessary to have the mechanisms to implement best practices (for example, implement and manage IT operations processes in line with the ITIL, increase the effectiveness of IT personnel (for example, automate repetitive tasks associated with IT operations processes), and have the tools to report on how well the processes are executed in line with established policies and service levels.

'''Sandra Moreschi''' (born December 7, 1946) is an Italian designer of [[Jewish ceremonial art]].

Since the end of the 1980s, Sandra Moreschi has been combining symbols of the Jewish tradition with contemporary design. From 1990 to 2016 she managed a store, Saray, located in the heart of the [[Roman Ghetto]] in via [[Porticus Octaviae|Portico d'Ottavia]]. During this time, she collaborated with Italian artisan shops, among them the Bottega Gatti of [[Faenza]]. Her works are present in important private, museum and institutional collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brockman|first1=Elin Schoen|title=The Jewish Traveler: Rome|url=http://www.hadassahmagazine.org/2010/08/17/jewish-traveler-rome/|website=Hadassah Magazine|date=Aug 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10901">In [[spatial ecology]] and [[macroecology]], '''scaling pattern of occupancy''' ('''SPO'''), also known as the '''area-of-occupancy''' ('''AOO''') is the way in which species distribution changes across spatial scales.  In [[physical geography]] and [[image analysis]], it is similar to the [[modifiable areal unit problem]]. [[Simon A. Levin]] (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Levin, SA. 1992. The problem of pattern and scale in ecology. Ecology, 73, 1943&amp;ndash;1967.[http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2307/1941447]&lt;/ref&gt; states that ''the problem of relating phenomena across scales is the central problem in biology and in all of science''. Understanding the SPO is thus one central theme in ecology.

== Pattern description ==

This pattern is often plotted as log-transformed grain (cell size) versus log-transformed occupancy. Kunin (1998)&lt;ref&gt;Kunin, WE. 1998. Extrapolating species abundance across spatial scales. Science, 281: 1513&amp;ndash;1515.[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/281/5382/1513]&lt;/ref&gt; presented a log-log linear SPO and suggested a fractal nature for species distributions. It has since been shown to follow a [[Logistic distribution|logistic]] shape, reflecting a [[percolation]] process. Furthermore, the SPO is closely related to the intraspecific [[occupancy-abundance relationship]]. For instance, if individuals are randomly distributed in space, the number of individuals in an ''α''-size cell follows a [[Poisson distribution]], with the occupancy being ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;exp(&amp;minus;''μα''), where ''μ'' is the density.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, D.H. 1991. Correlations between incidence and abundance are expected by chance. Journal of Biogeography, 18: 463&amp;ndash;466.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2845487]&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, P&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; in this Poisson model for randomly distributed individuals is also the SPO. Other probability distributions, such as the [[negative binomial distribution]], can also be applied for describing the SPO and the occupancy-abundance relationship for non-randomly distributed individuals.&lt;ref&gt;He, F., Gaston, K.J. 2000. Estimating species abundance from occurrence. American Naturalist, 156: 553&amp;ndash;559.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3079057]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other occupancy-abundance models that can be used to describe the SPO includes Nachman's exponential model,&lt;ref&gt;Nachman, G. 1981. A mathematical model of the functional relationship between density and spatial distribution of a population. Journal of Animal Ecology, 50: 453&amp;ndash;460.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4066]&lt;/ref&gt; Hanski and Gyllenberg's [[metapopulation]] model,&lt;ref&gt;Hanski, I., Gyllenberg, M. 1997. Uniting two general patterns in the distribution of species. Science, 284: 334&amp;ndash;336.[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/275/5298/397]&lt;/ref&gt; He and Gaston's&lt;ref&gt;He, F., Gaston, K.J. 2003. Occupancy, spatial variance, and the abundance of species. American Naturalist, 162: 366&amp;ndash;375.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3473189]&lt;/ref&gt; improved negative binomial model by applying [[Taylor's law|Taylor's power law]] between the mean and variance of species distribution,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, L.R. 1961. Aggregation, variance and the mean. Nature, 189: 732&amp;ndash;735.[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v189/n4766/abs/189732a0.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and Hui and McGeoch's droopy-tail percolation model.&lt;ref&gt;Hui, C., McGeoch, MA. 2007. Capturing the "droopy tail" in the occupancy-abundance relationship. Ecoscience, 14: 103&amp;ndash;108.[http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2980/1195-6860%282007%2914%5B103%3ACTDITO%5D2.0.CO%3B2?journalCode=ecos]&lt;/ref&gt; One important application of the SPO in ecology is to estimate species abundance based on presence-absence data, or occupancy alone.&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, S., Kunin, WE. 2003. Scale dependence of rarity, extinction risk, and conservation priority. Conservation Biology, 17: 1559&amp;ndash;1570.&lt;/ref&gt; This is appealing because obtaining presence-absence data is often cost-efficient. Using a dipswitch test consisting of 5 subtests and 15 criteria, [[Cang Hui|Hui]] et al.&lt;ref&gt;Hui, C., McGeoch, M.A., Reyers, B., le Roux, P.C., Greve, M., Chown, S.L. 2009. Extrapolating population size from the occupancy-abundance relationship and the scaling pattern of occupancy. Ecological Applications, 19: 2038&amp;ndash;2048.[http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/08-2236.1]&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that using the SPO is a robust and reliable for assemblage-scale regional abundance estimation. The other application of SPOs includes trends identification in populations, which is extremely valuable for [[biodiversity]] [[Conservation biology|conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, RJ., Thomas, CD., Fox, R., Roy, RD., Kunin, WE. 2004. Spatial patterns in species distributions reveals biodiversity change. Nature, 432: 393&amp;ndash;396.[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v432/n7015/abs/nature03031.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==

Models providing explanations to the observed scaling pattern of occupancy include the [[fractal]] model, the cross-scale model and the Bayesian estimation model. The fractal model can be configured by dividing the landscape into quadrats of different sizes,&lt;ref&gt;Hasting, H.M. &amp; Sugihara, G. (1993) Fractals: a User's Guide for the Natural Sciences. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kunin, WE. 1998. Extrapolating species abundance across spatial scales. Science, 281: 1513&amp;ndash;1515.&lt;/ref&gt; or bisecting into grids with special width-to-length ratio (2:1),&lt;ref&gt;Harte, J., Kinzig, A.P. &amp; Green, J. (1999) Self-similarity in the distribution and abundance of species. Science 294, 334&amp;ndash;336.[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/284/5412/334]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hui, C. &amp; McGeoch, M.A. (2007) A self-similarity model for occupancy frequency distributions. Theoretical Population Biology 71: 61&amp;ndash;70.[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2006.07.007]&lt;/ref&gt; and yields the following SPO:

: &lt;math&gt;P_a=P_0 a^{D/2-1} \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D'' is the box-counting fractal dimension. If during each step a quadrat is divided into ''q'' sub-quadrats, we will find a constant portion (''f'') of sub-quadrats is also presence in the fractal model, i.e. ''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''&amp;fnof;''/log&amp;nbsp;''q''). Since this assumption that ''f'' is scale independent is not always the case in nature,&lt;ref&gt;Hui, C. &amp; McGeoch, M.A. (2007) Modeling species distributions by breaking the assumption of self-similarity. Oikos 116: 2097&amp;ndash;2107.[https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16149.x]&lt;/ref&gt; a more general form of ''&amp;fnof;'' can be assumed, ''&amp;fnof;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''λ''&lt;/sup&gt; (''λ'' is a constant), which yields the cross-scale model:&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, J.J., Kunin, W.E., Hartley, S. &amp; Gaston, K.J. (2007) Species distribution patterns, diversity scaling and testing for fractals in southern African birds. In: Scaling Biology (D. Storch, P.A. Marquet &amp; J.H. Brown, eds.), pp. 51&amp;ndash;76. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;P_{a_j}=f_0 f_1 \cdots  f_j. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The Bayesian estimation model follows a different way of thinking. Instead of providing the best-fit model as above, the occupancy at different scales can be estimated by Bayesian rule based on not only the occupancy but also the spatial [[autocorrelation]] at one specific scale. For the Bayesian estimation model, [[Cang Hui|Hui]] et al.&lt;ref&gt;Hui, C., McGeoch, M.A. &amp; Warren, M. (2006) A spatially explicitly approach to estimating species occupancy and spatial correlation. Journal of Animal Ecology 75: 140&amp;ndash;147.[https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.01029.x]&lt;/ref&gt; provide the following formula to describe the SPO and join-count statistics of spatial autocorrelation:

: &lt;math&gt;p\,{(4a)_+}=1 - \frac{{\Omega }^4}{\mho }&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;q\,{(4a)_{+/+}}=\frac{{\Omega }^{10} - 
    2\,{\Omega }^4\,
     {\mho }^2 + {\mho }^3}
    {{\mho }^2\,
    \left( -{\Omega }^4 + 
      \mho  \right) }&lt;/math&gt;

where Ω&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''(''a'')&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''q''(''a'')&lt;sub&gt;0/+&lt;/sub&gt;''p''(''a'')&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mho&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''(''a'')&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p''(''a'')&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(2''q''(''a'')&lt;sub&gt;+/+&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;p(a)&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;(''q''(''a'')&lt;sub&gt;+/+&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3)). ''p''(''a'')&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; is occupancy; ''q''(''a'')&lt;sub&gt;+/+&lt;/sub&gt; is the conditional probability that a randomly chosen adjacent quadrat of an occupied quadrat is also occupied. The conditional probability ''q''(''a'')&lt;sub&gt;0/+&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''q''(''a'')&lt;sub&gt;+/+&lt;/sub&gt; is the absence probability in a quadrate adjacent to an occupied one; ''a'' and 4''a'' are the grains. The R-code of the Bayesian estimation model has been provided elsewhere [http://www.unc.edu/~dmcglinn/local_density_script.R]. The key point of the Bayesian estimation model is that the scaling pattern of species distribution, measured by occupancy and spatial pattern, can be extrapolated across scales. Later on, [[Cang Hui|Hui]]&lt;ref&gt;Hui, C. (2009) On the scaling patterns of species spatial distribution and association.

: &lt;math&gt;P_a = 1-b c^{2a^{1/2}} h^a \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''b'', ''c'', and ''h'' are constants.  This SPO becomes the Poisson model when ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. In the same paper, the scaling pattern of join-count spatial autocorrelation and multi-species association (or [[co-occurrence]]) were also provided by the Bayesian model, suggesting that "''the Bayesian model can grasp the statistical essence of species scaling patterns.''"

== Implications for biological conservation ==

The probability of species extinction and ecosystem collapse increases rapidly as range size declines. In risk assessment protocols such as the [[IUCN Red List]] of Species or the [[IUCN Red List of Ecosystems]], '''area of occupancy (AOO)''' is used as a standardized, complementary and widely applicable measure of risk spreading against spatially explicit threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=Nicholas J.|last2=Keith|first2=David A.|last3=Bland|first3=Lucie M.|last4=Nicholson|first4=Emily|last5=Regan|first5=Tracey J.|last6=Rodríguez6,7,8|first6=Jon Paul|last7=Bedward|first7=Michael|title=The use of range size to assess risks to biodiversity from stochastic threats|journal=Diversity and Distributions|date=2017|pages=1–17|doi=10.1111/ddi.12533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=Nicholas|title=Global 10 x 10-km grids suitable for use in IUCN Red List of Ecosystems assessments (vector and raster format)|journal=figshare|date=2017|doi=10.6084/m9.figshare.4653439.v1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''seed orchard''' is an intensively-managed [[plantation]] of specifically arranged trees for the mass production of genetically improved seeds to create plants, or seeds for the establishment of new forests.

==General==
Seed orchards are a common method of mass-multiplication for transferring genetically improved material from breeding populations to production populations (forests) and in this sense are often referred to as "multiplication" populations. A seed orchard is often composed of grafts (vegetative copies) of selected [[genotype]]s, but seedling seed orchards also occur mainly to combine orchard with progeny testing.
Seed orchards are the strong link between breeding programs and plantation establishment. They are designed and managed to produce seeds of superior genetic quality compared to those obtained from seed production areas, seed stands, or unimproved stands.

==Material and connection with breeding population==
In first generation seed orchards, the parents usually are phenotypically-selected trees. In advanced generation seed orchards, the seed orchards are harvesting the benefits generated by [[tree breeding]] and the parents may be selected among the tested clones or families. It is efficient to synchronise the productive live cycle of the seed orchards with the cycle time of the breeding population. In the seed orchard, the trees can be arranged in a design to keep the related individuals or cloned copies apart from each other.
Seed orchards are the delivery vehicle for genetic improvement programs where the trade-off between genetic gain and diversity is the most important concern. The genetic gain of seed orchard crops depends primarily on the genetic superiority of the orchard parents, the gametic contribution to the resultant seed crops, and pollen contamination from outside seed orchards.

==Genetic diversity of seed orchard crops==
[[Seed production and gene diversity]] is an important aspect when using improved materials like seed orchard crops. Seed orchards crops derive generally from a limited number of trees. But if it is a common [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] species much pollen will come from outside the seed orchard and widen the [[genetic diversity]]. The genetic gain of the first generation seed orchards is not great and the seed orchard progenies overlap with unimproved material. Gene diversity of the seed crops is greatly influenced by the relatedness (kinship) among orchard parents, the parental fertility variation, and the pollen contamination.

==Management and practical examples==
Seed orchards are usually managed to obtain sustainable and large crops of seeds of good quality. To achieve this, the following methods are commonly applied: orchards are established on flat surface sites with southern exposure (better conditions for orchard maintenance and for seed production), no stands of the same species in close proximity (avoid strong pollen contamination), sufficient area to produce and be mainly pollinated with their own pollen cloud, cleaning the corridors between the rows, fertilising, and supplemental pollination. The genetic quality of seed orchards can be improved by genetic thinning and selective harvesting.&lt;ref name=prescher2008&gt;Prescher F., Lindgren D. and Karlsson B. 2008. [https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/719822 Genetic thinning of clonal seed orchards using linear deployment may improve both gain and diversity.] ''Forest Ecology and Management'' 254: 188–192.&lt;/ref&gt; In plantation forestry with [[southern yellow pine]]s in the United States, almost all plants originate from seed orchards and most plantations are planted in family blocks, thus the harvest from each clone is kept separate during seed processing, plant production and plantation.&lt;ref name=mckeand&gt;McKeand, S., et al. 2003. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/saf/jof/2003/00000101/00000003/art00009 Deployment of genetically improved loblolly and slash pine in the South.] ''Journal of Forestry'' 101(3): 32–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent seed orchard research==
* The optimal balance between the effective number of clones (diversity, status number, gene diversity) and genetic gain is achieved by making clonal contributions (number of [[ramet]]s) proportional (linearly dependent) to the genetic value ("linear deployment"). This is dependent on several assumptions, one of them that the contribution to the seed orchard crop is proportional to the number of ramets. But the more ramets the larger the share of the pollen is lost depending on ineffective [[self-pollination]]. But even considering this, the linear deployment is a very good approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Prescher F., Lindgren D. and El-Kassaby Y. 2006. [https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/2070630 Is linear deployment of clones optimal under different clonal outcrossing contributions in seed orchards?] ''Tree Genetics &amp; Genomes'' 2:25–29.&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought that increasing the gain is always accompanied by a loss in effective number of clones, but it has shown that both can be obtained in the same time by genetic thinning using the linear deployment algorithm if applied to some rather unbalanced seed orchards.&lt;ref name=prescher2008/&gt; Relatedness among clones is more critical for diversity than inbreeding.
* The clonal variation in expected seed set has been compiled for 12 adult clonal seed orchards of [[Scots pine]].&lt;ref&gt;Prescher F., et al. 2007.  [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02827580701419259 Variation in female fertility in mature ''Pinus sylvestris'' clonal seed orchards.] ''Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research'' 22:280–289.&lt;/ref&gt; The seed set ability is not that drastic among clones as has been shown in other investigations which are probably less relevant for actual seed production of Scots pine.
* The correlations of cone set for Scots pine in a clonal archive was not well correlated with that of the same clones in seed orchards.&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren D., Tellalov Y. and Prescher F. 2007. [http://daglindgren.upsc.se/Meetings/Antalya06/Turkey06LindgrenTellalov.pdf Seed set for Scots pine grafts is difficult to predict.] ''In'': Isik, F. (Ed.) Proceedings of the IUFRO Division 2 Joint Conference: Low Input Breeding and Conservation of Forest Genetic Resources: Antalya, Turkey, 9–13 October 2006. pp. 139–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it does not seem meaningful to increase seed set by choosing clones with a good seed set.
*  As supporting tree breeding make advances, new seed orchards will be genetically better than old ones. This is a relevant factor for the economic lifetime of a seed orchard. Considerations for Swedish Scots pine suggested an economic lifetime of 30 years, which is less than the current lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;El-Kassaby Y., Prescher F. and Lindgren D. 2007. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02827580701217752 Advanced generation seed orchards’ turnover as affected by breeding advance, time to sexual maturity, and costs, with special reference to ''Pinus sylvestris'' in Sweden.] ''Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research'' 22:88–98.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Seed orchards for important wind pollinated species start to produce seeds before the seed orchard trees start to produce much pollen. Thus all or most of the pollen parents are outside the seed orchard. Calculations indicates that seed orchard seeds are still to be expected to a superior alternative to older and more mature seed orchards or stand seeds. Advantage of early seeds like absence of selfing or related matings and high diversity are positive factors in the early seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson J. &amp; Lindgren D. 2005. [http://daglindgren.upsc.se/Meetings/Komi05/proceedings.pdf Using seed orchard seeds with unknown fathers.] ''In'': Fedorkov A. (Ed.) Status, monitoring and targets for breeding programs. Proceedings of the meeting of Nordic forest tree breeders and forest geneticists, Syktyvkar 2005, {{ISBN|5-89606-249-4}}, pp. 57–64.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Swedish conifers orchards with tested clones could have 20–25 clones with more ramets from the better and less from the worse so effective ramet number is 15–18. Higher clone number results in unneeded loss of genetic gain. Lower clone numbers can still be better than existing alternatives. For southern pines in United States it may be optimal with half as many clones.&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren D. and Prescher F. 2005. [http://daglindgren.upsc.se/Papers/Articles2004-2005/CloneNumberSG05.pdf Optimal clone number for seed orchards with tested clones.] ''Silvae Genetica'' 54: 80–92.&lt;/ref&gt;
* When forest tree breeding proceeds to advanced generations the candidates to seed orchards will be related and the question to what degree related clones can be tolerated in seed orchards become urgent. Gene diversity seems to be a more important consideration than inbreeding. If the number of candidates have at least eight times as much diversity (status number) as required for the seed orchard relations are not limiting and clones can be deployed as usual but restricting for half and full sibs, but if the candidate population has a lower diversity more sophisticated algorithms are needed.&lt;ref&gt;Danusevicius D. &amp; Lindgren D. 2008.

'''Spaltklang''' (literally: ''split sound'') is a term in [[music theory]]. It is defined as an extremely clear and transparent sound pattern of an [[instrumental piece]]. It stands in opposition to the music of the Classical-Romantic period which favoured the merging of the individual instrumental voices to one complex sound.

Examples of applied Spaltklang can be found in [[New Music]] such as [[Igor Stravinsky]]’s [[Histoire du soldat]]. Instrumental categories are represented by the high- and low-[[Pitch (music)|pitch]]ed instruments; middle-toned instruments, on the other hand, are not accounted for. In the [[string section]], for instance, only [[violin]] and [[double bass]] are represented, while [[viola]] and [[cello]] are not. This pitch gap creates a clear contrast and prevents the individual tones from merging into one sound.

Moreover, the term appears in connection with [[multiphonics]].

The term Spaltklang can also be found in the field of [[organ building]]. Here, it refers to organs that have [[Register (phonology)|registers]] with very different and distinct [[timbres]]. Therefore, single registers tend to be played in isolation. This is in contrast to organs which operate on the basis of a merged sound, which is achieved by adding registers to a [[root note]]. Spaltklang seems to be particularly associated with organs from the [[Renaissance]] period. Amongst organists, Spaltklang is furthermore used to describe the omission of a register, e.g. playing the 8‘ and 2’ registers but omitting the 4’ register.

== Surface engineering ==

[[Surface engineering]] is the sub-discipline of [[materials science]] which deals with the surface of solid matter.  It has applications to [[chemistry]], [[mechanical engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]] (particularly in relation to [[semiconductor manufacturing]]).

[[Solids]] are composed of a bulk material covered by a surface. The surface which bounds the bulk material is called the [[Surface phase]]. It acts as an interface to the surrounding environment. The bulk material in a solid is called the [[Bulk phase]].

The surface phase of a solid interacts with the surrounding environment. This interaction can degrade the surface phase over time. Environmental degradation of the surface phase over time can be caused by [[wear]], [[corrosion]], [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and [[Creep (deformation)|creep]].

Surface engineering involves altering the properties of the Surface Phase in order to reduce the degradation over time. This is accomplished by making the surface robust to the environment in which it will be used.

===Applications and Future of Surface Engineering===

Surface engineering techniques are being used in the automotive, aerospace, missile, power, electronic, biomedical,&lt;ref name="synthesis2010"/&gt; textile, petroleum, petrochemical, chemical, steel, power, cement, machine tools, construction industries. Surface engineering techniques can be used to develop a wide range of functional properties, including physical, chemical, electrical, electronic, magnetic, mechanical, wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant properties at the required substrate surfaces.  Almost all types of materials, including metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites can be coated on similar or dissimilar materials.  It  is also possible to form coatings of newer materials (e.g., met glass. beta-C3N4), graded deposits, multi-component deposits etc.

In 1995, surface engineering was a ₤10 billion market in the United Kingdom. Coatings, to make surface life robust from wear and corrosion, was approximately half the market.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

[[Functionalization of Antimicrobial Surfaces]] is a unique technology that can be used for sterilization in health industry, self-cleaning surfaces and protection from bio films.

In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in surface engineering from age-old electroplating to processes such as vapor phase deposition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Zhenping|author2=Ilona Kretzschmar |title=Template-Assisted GLAD: Approach to Single and Multipatch Patchy Particles with Controlled Patch Shape|journal=Langmuir|date=6 December 2013|volume=29|issue=51|pages=15755–15761|doi=10.1021/la404592z|pmid=24313824}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Zhenping|author2=Kretzschmar, Ilona |title=Template-Assisted Fabrication of Patchy Particles with Uniform Patches|journal=Langmuir|date=3 June 2012|volume=28|issue=26|pages=9915–9919|doi=10.1021/la3017563|pmid=22708736}}&lt;/ref&gt; diffusion, thermal spray &amp; welding using advanced heat sources like plasma,&lt;ref name="vacuum2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="synthesis2010"/&gt; laser, ion, electron, microwave, solar beams, synchrotron radiation,&lt;ref name="synthesis2010"/&gt; pulsed arc, pulsed combustion, spark, friction and induction.

It's estimated that loss due to wear and corrosion in the US is approximately $500 billion. In the US, there are around 9524 establishments (including automotive, aircraft, power and construction industries) who depend on engineered surfaces with support from 23,466 industries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

'''Surface functionalization''' introduces chemical [[functional group]]s to a surface. This way, materials with functional groups on their surfaces can be designed from substrates with standard bulk material properties. Prominent examples can be found in semiconductor industry and biomaterial research.&lt;ref name="synthesis2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12212">'''Systems psychology''' is a branch of both [[theoretical psychology]] and [[applied psychology]] that studies [[human behaviour]] and [[experience]] in [[complex system]]s. It is inspired by [[systems theory]] and [[systems thinking]], and based on the theoretical work of [[Roger Barker]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Humberto Maturana]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne M. Plas (1986) ''Systems psychology in the schools''. p.xvi&lt;/ref&gt; Groups and individuals are considered as [[systems]] in [[homeostasis]]. Alternative terms here are "systemic psychology", "systems behavior", and "systems-based psychology".{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== Types ==
In the scientific literature, different kinds of systems psychology have been mentioned:

;Applied systems psychology
:In the 1970s the term applied systems psychology was being used as a specialism directly related to [[engineering psychology]] and [[human factor]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon B. De Greene, Earl A. Alluisi (1970), ''Systems Psychology'', McGraw-Hill. p.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald John Beishon, Geoff Peters (1976) ''Systems behaviour''. p.144&lt;/ref&gt;

;Cognitive systems theory
:Cognitive systems psychology is a part of [[cognitive psychology]] and like [[existential psychology]], attempts to dissolve the barrier between [[conscious]] and the unconscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;David Parrish (2006), "Nothing I See Means Anything: Quantum Questions, Quantum Answers", p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

;Concrete systems psychology
:Concrete systems psychology is the study of human systems across the varied biological contexts and situations of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=J.G.|title=A theoretical review of individual and group psychological reaction to stress, in Grosser G.H.

;Contract-systems psychology
:Contract-systems psychology is about the human systems actualization through participative organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Guttentag and Elmer L Struening (1975), ''Handbook of Evaluation Research''. Sage. {{ISBN|0-8039-0429-0}}. page 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Family systems psychology
:Family systems psychology is a more general name for the subfield of [[family systems therapy|family therapists]]. E.g. [[Murray Bowen]], Michael E. Kerr, and Baard&lt;ref&gt;Michael B. Goodman (1998), ''Corporate Communications for Executives'', SUNY Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-3761-2}}. Page 72.&lt;/ref&gt; and researchers have begun to theorize a psychology of the family as a system.&lt;ref&gt;Sara E. Cooper (2004), ''The Ties That Bind: Questioning Family Dynamics and Family Discourse'', University Press of America. {{ISBN|0-7618-2649-1}}. Page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Organismic-systems psychology
:Through the application of organismic-systems biology to human behavior [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] conceived and developed the organismic-systems psychology, as the theoretical prospect needed for the gradual comprehension of the various ways human personalities may evolve and how they could evolve properly, being supported by a holistic interpretation of human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.bertalanffy.org/c_22.html | title = Organsmic Systems Psychology | accessdate = 21 March 2008 | publisher = Bertalanffy Center for the Study of Systems Science | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081001203159/http://www.bertalanffy.org/c_22.html

=== Ergonomics ===
{{Main|Ergonomics}}
Ergonomics, also called &lt;!-- "[[Engineering psychology]]" or --&gt; "[[human factors]]", is the application of scientific information concerning objects, systems and environment for human use (definition adopted by the [[International Ergonomics Association]] in 2007). Ergonomics is commonly described as the way companies design tasks and work areas to maximize the efficiency and quality of their employees’ work. However, ergonomics comes into everything which involves people. Work systems, sports and leisure, health and safety should all embody ergonomics principles if well designed.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Equipment design is intended to maximize productivity by reducing operator fatigue and discomfort. The field is also called human engineering and [[human factors engineering]]. Ergonomic research is primarily performed by ergonomists who study human capabilities in relationship to their work demands. Information derived from ergonomists contributes to the design and evaluation of tasks, jobs, products, environments and systems in order to make them compatible with the needs, abilities and limitations of people.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Family system therapy===
{{Main|Family therapy}}
Family system therapy, also referred to as "family  therapy" and "couple and family therapy", is a branch of [[psychotherapy]] related to [[relationship counseling]] that works with [[family|families]] and couples in [[intimate relationship]]s to nurture change and development. It tends to view the family as a system, family relationships as an important factor in psychological health. As such, family problems have been seen to arise as an [[emergence|emergent]] property of systemic interactions, rather than to be blamed on individual members. Marriage and Family Therapists (MFTs) are the most specifically trained in this type of psychotherapy.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Organizational psychology ===
{{Main|Industrial and organizational psychology}}
Industrial and organizational psychology also known as "work psychology", "occupational psychology" or "personnel psychology" concerns the application of [[psychology|psychological]] theories, research methods, and intervention strategies to workplace issues. Industrial and organizational psychologists are interested in making organizations more productive while ensuring workers are able to lead physically and psychologically healthy lives. Relevant topics include personnel psychology, [[motivation]] and [[leadership]], employee selection, training and development, organization development and guided change, [[organizational behavior]], and job and family issues.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Perceptual control theory ===
{{Main|Perceptual control theory}}
Perceptual control theory (PCT) is a psychological theory of animal and [[human behavior]] originated by [[William T. Powers]]. In contrast with other theories of psychology and behavior, which assume that behavior is a function of perception — that perceptual inputs determine or cause behavior — PCT postulates that an organism's behavior is a means of controlling its perceptions. In contrast with [[control theory|engineering control theory]], the reference variable for each [[negative feedback]] control loop in a control hierarchy is set from within the system (the organism), rather than by an external agent changing the [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] of the [[Controller (control theory)|controller]].&lt;ref name="CT_disfunctions"&gt;[[control theory|Engineering control theory]] also makes use of [[Feed forward (control)|feedforward]], [[Model predictive control|predictive control]], and other functions that are not required to model the behavior of living organisms.&lt;/ref&gt; PCT also applies to nonliving [[Autonomic Systems|autonomic systems]].&lt;ref name="Byte"&gt;For an introduction, see the ''Byte'' articles on robotics and the article on the origins of purpose in this [http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/intro_papers/bill_pct.html collection] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604100935/http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/intro_papers/bill_pct.html |date=4 June 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''São Paulo State University''' ({{lang-pt|Universidade Estadual Paulista "Júlio de Mesquita Filho"}}, '''UNESP''') is one of the six public [[University|universities]] of the [[Brazil]]ian [[States of Brazil|state of]] [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] (the others are [[University of São Paulo|USP]], [[São Paulo State Technological Faculty|FATEC]], [[Universidade Estadual de Campinas|UNICAMP]], [[Universidade Federal do ABC|UFABC]], [[Universidade Federal de São Paulo|UNIFESP]]  and [[UFSCar]]). UNESP is part of the state’s higher education system and the only Brazilian member of the [[Compostela Group of Universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.usc.es/gcompostela/en/menu_superior/members/index.html|title=CGU Members|website=www2.usc.es|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESP has a combined student body of over 45,000 spread among its 23 campuses. The first of them is the Araraquara Pharmacy and Odontology Faculty, founded in 1923 and incorporated by the state of São Paulo in 1956. Before the university’s official foundation in 1976, its original 12 campuses were public independent faculties.

With a budget of R$2.6 billion in 2015, UNESP currently has 33 teaching, research and extension units in 23 campuses spread across inland and coastal cities, as well as in the city of São Paulo. It also has 30 libraries, two hospitals, three animal hospitals, five farms and seven complementary units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feg.unesp.br/Home/PaginasPessoais/profsalomon/unesp.pdf|title=Presentation about UNESP|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== History ==

Universities in Brazil are a recent phenomenon, compared to other Latin American countries. The first one was created in 1808 (Rio de Janeiro Medicine Faculty). Before the 20th century, there were no universities in the country. Existing institutions in higher education were either public or church-run independent institutes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro Federal University]] was the first one, containing every faculty inside Rio de Janeiro city in 1926. São Paulo’s first university was [[University of São Paulo|USP]], founded in 1933. By the 1950s, countryside people had to move toward capitals for undergraduate study. There were few higher education institutes outside Brazilian metropolises then.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[São Paulo state government]] created many colleges outside the capital in the 1950s and 1960s. Prominent cities in the state received these isolated institutes, known as “Faculdade de Filosofia”.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In the 1970s, discussions were made within state government on how to coordinate the separate institutes. One Suggestions was to join the 14 institutes in a federation or a single university, which was enacted on subsequently.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Inspired by the [[University of California]] multi-campus system, UNESP was founded in 1976. The original campuses were in [[Araçatuba]], [[Araraquara]], [[Assis]], [[Botucatu]], [[Franca]], [[Guaratinguetá]], [[Ilha Solteira]], [[Jaboticabal]], [[Marília]], [[Presidente Prudente, São Paulo|Presidente Prudente]], [[Rio Claro, São Paulo|Rio Claro]], [[São José dos Campos]], [[São José do Rio Preto]] and São Paulo. [[Bauru]] campus was incorporated in 1988.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The name "Universidade Estadual Paulista" was suggested by the first rector of UNESP, Professor Luiz Ferreira Martins, and the name "Júlio de Mesquita Filho" was suggested by Prof. Dr. Moacyr Expedito Marret Vaz Guimarães, then President of the State Council of Education (EEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ict.unesp.br/#!/instituicao/memorias/biografias/luis-ferreira-martins/|title=UNESP: Câmpus de São José dos Campos - Instituto de Ciência e Tecnologia|website=www.ict.unesp.br|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==
[[File:Unesp_Marília.jpg|thumb|Campus Marília]]UNESP has a total of 1,900 laboratories and 30 libraries, which together have around 900,000 books available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.unesp.br/portal#!/international/about-unesp/libraries|title=Unesp - Universidade Estadual Paulista - Portal|website=www2.unesp.br|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In addition the facilities encompass museums, gardens, parks, botanical gardens and five experimental farms, totaling an area of 62.8 million m², of which 745.4 thousand m² are developed area.

The university also owns the Hospital de Clínicas de Botucatu and manages the State Hospital of Bauru, which together have around 800 beds, as well as veterinary hospitals and dentistry, psychology, speech therapy and physiotherapy clinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.unesp.br/portal#!/international/about-unesp/history|title=Unesp - Universidade Estadual Paulista - Portal|website=www2.unesp.br|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2018}}[[File:SaoPaulo_RedeUNESP.svg|thumb|Map of the state of São Paulo with districts that are home to a campus of UNESP.]][[File:Unesp_Campus_Marília.jpg|thumb|Campus Marília]]

== Organization and administration ==
UNESP is governed by a [[Rector (academia)|rector]], appointed by the [[state governor]] who chooses the final candidate from a list of three nominees. The nominees are selected through elections, taking place among university’s academics held every four years. Usually, the governor selects the winner of those elections.{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The rector presides over the University Council, composed of directors of every institute in the system and academic representatives. There are ten students representatives. The council makes most decisions that affect the university.{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Each institute (there are campuses with more than one) has one director and a council who rules with a degree of autonomy.{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Academics ==
UNESP employs about 3,500 teachers, in addition to another 10,600 employees in various positions. The university provides 171 options for undergraduate courses in 62 higher education professions, with a total of over 45,000 students, of which 5,600 new professionals are trained annually by UNESP. About 10,000 students study in 118 postgraduate programs, with 117 academic masters, 6 professional masters and 93 academic doctorates.

The academic year at UNESP follows a two-semester schedule, with slight differences depending on the courses and programs chosen. The spring semester runs from August - December and the fall semester from February - June.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.unesp.br/portal#!/international/campus-life/plan-a-visit|title=Unesp - Universidade Estadual Paulista - Portal|website=www2.unesp.br|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the recent decade Brazil has generally become more widely recognized as a good academic environment (developing alongside the rest of the countries economy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-09-12|title=Spotlight on Latin America|url=https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj0389|journal=Nature Jobs|doi=10.1038/nj0389|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt; But with the economic crisis some universities in Brazil have struggled in the last years; the number of publications authored and co-authored from UNESP however, has continually risen since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/brazils-subsumed-science-sector-struggles-to-stay-afloat|title=Brazil’s subsumed science sector struggles to stay afloat|website=www.natureindex.com|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Admissions ===
Admissions to UNESP are restricted by a state-wide, general admissions exam, known as ''[[vestibular]]''. For [[architecture]], [[arts]] and [[design]] undergraduate courses, additional specific exams are required.

Prepared by VUNESP, an institution specialized in exams organization, UNESP vestibular are held on three days, separated in two phases.

# The first phase consists of 90 questions in the following disciplines: [[philosophy]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[physics]] and [[English language|English]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. 
# The second phase of exams, separated in two days, is made up of specific questions in Humane and Natural Sciences on the first day. The second day of the second phase consists of specific questions in Languages (Portuguese and English or Spanish) and a writing exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/29/world/rio-journal-for-brazil-s-college-bound-a-brutal-test-of-mettle.html|title=Rio Journal; For Brazil's College-Bound, a Brutal Test of Mettle|last=Rohter|first=Larry|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A student can only apply for a single course in the São Paulo State University system, preventing a simultaneous application for e.g. History and Geography.

=== Exchange programmes ===
UNESP has 140 international exchange and cooperation agreements with institutions of higher education in 52 countries. The main exchange countries for UNESP are currently [[Argentina]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Russia]], the [[United States]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.unesp.br/portal#!/international/study|title=Unesp - Universidade Estadual Paulista - Portal|website=www2.unesp.br|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unan.unesp.br/guidaprofissoes/pdf/m14_u6_21092017-13-40-56.pdf|title=Career guide UNESP - International Exchange|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To further support international students the university launched a program called "International Courses" in 2013. The program comprised four different areas initially: [[Agricultural science|Agricultural Sciences]], [[Alternative energy|Alternative Energy]], [[Dentistry]] and [[Literature]] and [[Linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.unesp.br/portal#!/international-courses|title=Unesp - Universidade Estadual Paulista - Portal|website=www2.unesp.br|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2736">In [[Telecommunication]] and [[Computer networking]], '''time-driven switching''' (TDS) is a node by node time variant implementation of [[Circuit switching]], where the propagating datagram is shorter in space than the distance between source and destination. With TDS it is no longer necessary to own a complete circuit between source and destination, but only the fraction of circuit where the propagating datagram is temporarily located.
TDS adds flexibility and capacity to Circuit Switched networks but requires precise synchronization among nodes and propagating datagrams. 

Datagrams are formatted according to schedules that depend on [[Quality of service]] and availability of switching nodes and physical links. Respect to [[Circuit switching]] the added time dimension introduces additional complexity to network management. Like [[Circuit switching]], TDS operates without buffers and header processing according to the [[pipeline forwarding]] principle; therefore an all optical implementation with [[Optical fibers]] and [[Optical Switches]] is possible with low cost. The TDS concept itself pervades and is applicable with advantage to existing data switching technologies, including [[Packet switching]], where packets, or sets of packets become the datagrams that are routed through the network.

TDS has been invented in 2002 by [https://web.archive.org/web/20110723202108/http://www.mariobaldi.net/ Prof. Mario Baldi] and prof. [[Yoram Ofek]] of [http://www.synchrodyne.com Synchrodyne Networks, Inc.] that is the assignee of [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;TERM1=synchrodyne&amp;FIELD1=ASNM&amp;co1=AND&amp;TERM2=&amp;FIELD2=&amp;d=PTXT several patents] issued by both the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] and the [[European Patent Office]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18265">'''Tinbergen's four questions''', named after [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and based on [[Aristotle]]'s [[four causes]], are complementary categories of explanations for behaviour.  These are also commonly referred to as '''levels of analysis'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacDougall-Shackleton |first=Scott A. |date=2011-07-27 |title=The levels of analysis revisited |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=366 |issue=1574 |pages=2076–2085 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0363 |pmc=3130367 |pmid=21690126}}&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests that an integrative understanding of behaviour must include both a proximate and ultimate (functional) analysis of behaviour, as well as an understanding of both phylogenetic/developmental history and the operation of current mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, M &amp; Wilson, M. (1983). Sex, evolution, and behaviour. Brooks-Cole. {{page needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four categories of questions and explanations==

When asked about the purpose of sight in humans and animals, even elementary school children can answer that animals have vision to help them find food and avoid danger ([[function (biology)|function]]/[[adaptation]]). Biologists have three additional explanations:  sight is caused by a particular series of evolutionary steps ([[phylogeny]]), the mechanics of the eye (mechanism/causation), and even the process of an individual's development ([[ontogeny]]).  Although these answers may be very different, they are consistent with each other. This idea was formulated in the 1960s when Tinbergen delineated the '''four questions''' based on [[Aristotle]]'s [[four causes]].&lt;ref name=h&amp;h&gt;Hladký, V. &amp; Havlíček, J. (2013). ''[http://ishe.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HEB_2013_28_4_3-11.pdf Was Tinbergen an Aristotelian? Comparison of Tinbergen's Four Whys and Aristotle's Four Causes]''. ''Human Ethology Bulletin'', 28(4), 3-11&lt;/ref&gt;

This schema constitutes a basic framework of the overlapping behavioural fields of [[ethology]], [[behavioural ecology]], [[comparative psychology]], [[sociobiology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[anthropology]]. It was in fact Julian Huxley who identified the first three questions, Niko Tinbergen gave only the fourth question, but Julian Huxley's questions failed to distinguish between survival value and evolutionary history, so Tinbergen's fourth question helped resolve this problem.&lt;ref&gt;p411 in Tinbergen, Niko (1963) "On Aims and Methods in Ethology," Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie, 20: 410–433.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary (ultimate) explanations===

==== 1 Function (adaptation) ====
Darwin's theory of [[evolution]] by natural selection is the only scientific explanation for why an animal's behaviour is usually well adapted for survival and reproduction in its environment. However, claiming that a particular mechanism is well suited to the present environment is different from claiming that this mechanism was selected for in the past due to its history of being adaptive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolaas Tinbergen]]&lt;/ref&gt; The literature conceptualizes the relationship between function and evolution in two ways. On the one hand, function and evolution are often presented as separate and distinct explanations of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], [[ethology]], Cartwright 2000:10; Buss 2004:12)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the common definition of adaptation, a central concept in evolution, is a trait that was functional to the reproductive success of the organism and that is thus now present due to being selected for; that is, function and evolution are inseparable. However a trait can have a current function that is adaptive without being an adaptation in this sense, if for instance the environment has changed. Imagine an environment in which having a small body suddenly conferred benefit on an organism when previously body size had had no effect on survival.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolaas Tinbergen]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A small body's function in the environment would then be adaptive, but it wouldn't become an adaptation until enough generations had passed in which small bodies were advantageous to reproduction for small bodies to be selected for. Given this, it is best to understand that presently functional traits might not all have been produced by natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolaas Tinbergen]]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "function" is preferable to "adaptation", because adaptation is often construed as implying that it was selected for due to past function.

It corresponds to Aristotle's [[final cause]].&lt;ref name=h&amp;h/&gt;

==== 2 Phylogeny (evolution) ====

''[[Evolution]]'' captures both the history of an organism via its phylogeny, and the history of natural selection working on function to produce adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;"Phylogeny" often emphasizes the evolutionary genealogical relationships among species (Alcock 2001:492; Mayr, 2001:289) as distinct from the categories of explanations.  Although the categories are more relevant in a conceptual discussion, the traditional term is retained here.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several reasons why [[natural selection]] may fail to achieve optimal design (Mayr 2001:140–143; Buss et al. 1998).  One entails random processes such as [[mutation]] and environmental events acting on small [[population]]s.  Another entails the constraints resulting from early evolutionary development. Each [[organism]] harbors [[Trait (biology)|traits]], both [[anatomical]] and [[behavioural]], of previous phylogenetic stages, since many traits are retained as [[species]] evolve.

Reconstructing the phylogeny of a species often makes it possible to understand the "uniqueness" of recent characteristics: Earlier phylogenetic stages and (pre-) conditions which persist often also determine the form of more modern characteristics. For instance, the [[vertebrate]] [[eye]] (including the [[human eye]]) has a [[Blind spot (vision)|blind spot]], whereas [[Cephalopod eye|octopus eyes]] do not.  In those two lineages, the eye was originally constructed one way or the other.  Once the vertebrate eye was constructed, there were no intermediate forms that were both adaptive and would have enabled it to evolve without a blind spot.

It corresponds to Aristotle's [[formal cause]].&lt;ref name=h&amp;h/&gt; 

===Proximate explanations===

==== 3 Mechanism (causation) ====

Some prominent classes of Proximate [[causal]] [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] include:

* The [[brain]]: For example, [[Broca's area]], a small section of the [[human brain]], has a critical role in [[The Language Instinct|linguistic capability]].
* [[Hormones]]: Chemicals used to  communicate among cells of an individual organism.  [[Testosterone]], for instance, stimulates aggressive behaviour in a number of species.
* [[Pheromones]]: Chemicals used to communicate among members of the same species.  Some species (e.g., dogs and some moths) use pheromones to attract mates.

In examining living organisms, [[biologists]] are confronted with diverse levels of [[complexity]] (e.g. chemical, physiological, psychological, social). They therefore investigate causal and functional relations within and between these levels. A [[biochemist]] might examine, for instance, the influence of social and ecological conditions on the release of certain [[neurotransmitters]] and hormones, and the effects of such releases on behaviour, e.g. stress during birth has a [[tocolytic]] (contraction-suppressing) effect.

However, awareness of neurotransmitters and the structure of [[neurons]] is not by itself enough to understand higher levels of neuroanatomic structure or behaviour: "The whole is more than the sum of its parts." All levels must be considered as being equally important: cf. [[transdisciplinarity]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]]'s "Laws about the Levels of Complexity."

It corresponds to Aristotle's [[efficient cause]].&lt;ref name=h&amp;h/&gt; 

====4 [[Ontogeny]] (development)====
In the latter half of the twentieth century, social scientists debated whether human behaviour was the product of nature (genes) or nurture (environment in the developmental period, including culture).

An example of interaction (as distinct from the sum of the components) involves familiarity from childhood.  In a number of species, individuals prefer to associate with familiar individuals but prefer to mate with unfamiliar ones (Alcock 2001:85–89, [[Incest taboo]], [[Incest]]).  By inference, genes affecting living together interact with the environment differently from genes affecting mating behaviour.  A homely example of interaction involves plants: Some plants grow toward the light ([[phototropism]]) and some away from gravity ([[gravitropism]]).

Many forms of developmental learning have a [[critical period]], for instance, for [[filial imprinting#Filial imprinting|imprinting]] among geese and [[language acquisition]] among humans.  In such cases, genes determine the timing of the environmental impact.

A related concept is labeled "biased learning" (Alcock 2001:101–103) and "prepared learning" (Wilson, 1998:86–87).  For instance, after eating food that subsequently made them sick, rats are predisposed to associate that food with smell, not sound (Alcock 2001:101–103).  Many primate species learn to fear snakes with little experience (Wilson, 1998:86–87).&lt;ref&gt;"Biased learning" is not necessarily limited to the developmental period.&lt;/ref&gt;

See [[developmental biology]] and [[developmental psychology]].

[[File:4 behavior questions.png|thumb|400px|right|Explanations of Animal Behaviour: Causal Relationships; Adopted from Tinbergen (1963).]]

It corresponds to Aristotle's [[material cause]].&lt;ref name=h&amp;h/&gt;

==Causal relationships==
The figure shows the causal relationships among the categories of explanations.  The left-hand side represents the evolutionary explanations at the species level; the right-hand side represents the proximate explanations at the individual level.  In the middle are those processes' end products—genes (i.e., genome) and behaviour, both of which can be analyzed at both levels.

Evolution, which is determined by both function and phylogeny, results in the genes of a population.  The genes of an individual interact with its developmental environment, resulting in mechanisms, such as a nervous system.  A mechanism (which is also an end-product in its own right) interacts with the individual's immediate environment, resulting in its behaviour.

Here we return to the population level.  Over many generations, the success of the species' behaviour in its ancestral environment (or more technically, the '''e'''nvironment of '''e'''volutionary '''a'''daptedness [EEA]) may result in evolution as measured by a change in its genes.

In sum, there are two processes—one at the population level and one at the individual level—which are influenced by environments in three time periods.

==Examples==

===Vision===

Four ways of explaining [[visual perception]]:
*Function: To find food and avoid danger.
*Phylogeny: The [[Evolution of the eye|vertebrate eye]] initially developed with a blind spot, but the lack of adaptive intermediate forms prevented the loss of the blind spot.
*Causation: The lens of the eye focuses light on the [[retina]].
*Development: [[Neurons]] need the stimulation of [[light]] to wire the eye to the brain (Moore, 2001:98–99).

===Westermarck effect===

Four ways of explaining the [[Westermarck effect]], the lack of sexual interest in one's siblings (Wilson, 1998:189–196):
*Function:  To discourage [[inbreeding]], which decreases the number of viable offspring.
*Phylogeny:  Found in a number of mammalian species, suggesting initial evolution tens of millions of years ago.
*Mechanism:  Little is known about the neuromechanism.
*Ontogeny:  Results from familiarity with another individual early in life, especially in the first 30 months for humans.  The effect is manifested in nonrelatives raised together, for instance, in [[kibbutz]]s.

==Use of the four-question schema as "periodic table"==
[[Konrad Lorenz]], [[Julian Huxley]] and Niko Tinbergen were familiar with both conceptual categories (i.e. the central questions of biological research: 1. - 4. and the levels of inquiry: a. - g.), the tabulation was made by [[Gerhard Medicus]].&lt;ref&gt;Mapping Transdisciplinarity in Human Sciences. In: Janice W. Lee (Ed.) Focus on Gender Identity. New York, 2005, [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]] [http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c720126/humanethologie/ws/medicus/block1/MappingISBN1-59454-212-0.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The tabulated schema is used as the central organizing device in many animal behaviour, ethology, behavioural ecology and evolutionary psychology textbooks  (e.g., Alcock, 2001) .  One advantage of this organizational system, what might be called the "periodic table of life sciences," is that it highlights gaps in knowledge, analogous to the role played by the [[periodic table]] of elements in the early years of chemistry.

This  "[[Biopsychosocial model|biopsychosocial]]"  framework clarifies and classifies the associations between the various levels of the natural and social sciences, and it helps to integrate the social and natural sciences into a "[[Tree of Knowledge System|tree of knowledge]]" (see also [[Nicolai Hartmann]]'s "Laws about the Levels of Complexity"). Especially for the social sciences, this model helps to provide an integrative, foundational model for [[interdisciplinary]] collaboration, teaching and research (see ''The Four Central Questions of Biological Research Using Ethology as an Example'' – [http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c720126/humanethologie/ws/medicus/block1/4BQ_E.pdf PDF]).

'''The Translational Genomics Research Institute''' ('''TGen'''), is a [[non-profit]] [[genomics]] [[research institute]] based in Arizona, United States. TGen seeks to employ [[genetics|genetic]] discoveries to improve disease outcomes by developing smarter [[diagnostics]] and [[targeted therapy|targeted therapeutics]].

== History and activities ==
TGen was established in 2002 by [[Jeffrey Trent]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], United States.  The Institute began with a {{US$|100 million}} investment from Arizona public- and private-sector investors.&lt;ref name="Alltucker20080416"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/business/articles/2008/04/16/20080416biz-tgenfund0416.html|title=5-year-old TGen fights for funding|last=Alltucker|first=Ken|date=16 April 2008|work=The Arizona Republic|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130117111231/http://www.azcentral.com/business/articles/2008/04/16/20080416biz-tgenfund0416.html?nclick_check=1|archive-date=17 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TGen conducts research on a number of human disorders including [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Autism]], [[Parkinson's]], [[Diabetes]] and numerous forms of [[cancer]] and a variety of other complex human diseases.  This internationally recognized institute has helped to generate a strong foundation for Arizona's growing role in scientific research and cutting edge [[biotechnology]].

The emerging field of [[Translational medicine|translational genomics research]] harnesses the power of new discoveries resulting from the [[Human Genome Project]] and applying them to the development of improved diagnostics, [[prognostics]] and therapies for cancer, [[neurological]] disorders, diabetes and other complex [[disease]]s.

The '''Newby-McMahon Building''', commonly referred to as the '''world's littlest skyscraper''', is located at 701 La Salle (on the corner of Seventh and La Salle streets) in downtown [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]], [[Texas]]. This late [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style red brick and [[cast stone]] structure is {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall,&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt; and its exterior dimensions are {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20091230/&gt; Its interior dimensions are approximately {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}}, or approximately {{convert|108|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. Steep, narrow, internal stairways leading to the upper floors occupy roughly 25 percent of the interior area.&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt;

Reportedly the result of a fraudulent investment scheme by a [[Confidence trick|confidence man]], the Newby-McMahon Building was a source of great embarrassment to the city and its residents after its completion in 1919. During the 1920s, the Newby-McMahon Building was featured in [[Robert Ripley]]'s ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' syndicated column as "the world's littlest skyscraper," a nickname that has stuck with it ever since. The Newby-McMahon Building is now part of the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Wichita County, Texas|Depot Square Historic District]] of Wichita Falls, a [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark|Texas Historic Landmark]].

==Background==
A large [[petroleum reservoir]] was discovered just west of the city of [[Burkburnett, Texas|Burkburnett]], a small town in [[Wichita County, Texas|Wichita County]], Texas in 1912.&lt;ref name=Kelly1982/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olien2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart2010/&gt; Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became [[boomtown]]s, experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative [[oil field]], and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of Wichita Falls began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity, Wichita Falls was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical hub, being the seat of Wichita County. Because office space was lacking, major stock transactions and [[mineral rights]] deals were conducted on street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20010725/&gt;

==Proposal and blueprints==
The Newby-McMahon Building is a four-story brick building located near the railroad depot in downtown Wichita Falls, built in 1906 by Augustus Newby (1855–1909),&lt;ref name=WDT1909/&gt;&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt; a director of the Wichita Falls and Oklahoma City Railway Company.&lt;ref name=OK1898/&gt; The oil-rig construction firm of J.D. McMahon, a [[Landman (oil worker)|petroleum landman]] and [[structural engineer]] from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], was one of seven tenants whose offices were based in the original Newby Building.&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt;&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt;

According to local legend,&lt;ref name=Kelso2007&gt;{{cite book|title=Texas Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities &amp; Other Offbeat Stuff|edition=3rd|chapter=North Texas|page=112|author=Kelso J|publisher=Morris Book Publishing|location=Kearney, Nebraska|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7627-4109-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gW9ye7wu0E0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Texas+Curiosities:+Quirky+Characters,+Roadside+Oddities+%26+Other+Offbeat+Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt; when McMahon announced in 1919 that he would build a highrise annex to the Newby Building as a solution to the newly wealthy city's urgent need for office space, investors were eager to invest in the project.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20010725/&gt;&lt;ref name=TAC20000915/&gt; McMahon collected $200,000 (US ${{Inflation|US|200000|1919|r=-5|fmt=c}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in [[Financial capital|investment capital]] from this group of naive investors, promising to construct a highrise office building across the street from the [[St. James Hotel (Wichita Falls, Texas)|St. James Hotel]].&lt;ref name=WFTRN20091230/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt;

The key to McMahon's swindle, and his successful defense in the ensuing lawsuit, was that he never verbally stated that the actual height of the building would be {{convert|480|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fodors2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; The proposed skyscraper depicted in the blueprints that he distributed (and which were approved by the investors) was clearly labeled as consisting of four floors and {{convert|480|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=Pohlen2006/&gt;

==Construction and ensuing legal battle==
McMahon used his own construction crews to build the McMahon Building on the small, unused piece of property next to the Newby Building, without obtaining prior consent from the owner of the property, who lived in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; As the building began to take shape, the investors realized they had been swindled into purchasing a four-story edifice that was only {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, rather than the {{convert|480|ft|m|abbr=on}} structure they were expecting.

They brought a lawsuit against McMahon, but to their dismay, the real estate and construction deal was declared legally binding by a local judge &amp;ndash; as McMahon had built exactly according to the blueprints they had approved, no legal remedy was available for the deceived investors.&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt; They did recover a small portion of their investment from the elevator company, which refused to honor the contract after they learned of the confidence trick. No stairway was installed in the building upon its initial completion, as none was included in the original blueprints. Rather, a ladder was employed to gain access to the upper three floors.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt; By the time construction was complete, McMahon had left Wichita Falls and perhaps even Texas, taking with him the balance of the investors' money.&lt;ref name=Pohlen2006/&gt;

==Early occupancy and subsequent abandonment==
Upon its completion and opening in 1919, the Newby-McMahon Building was an immediate source of great embarrassment to the city and its residents.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20010327/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20040506/&gt; The ground floor had six desks representing the six different companies that occupied the building as its original tenants.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; Throughout most of the 1920s, the building housed only two firms.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; During the 1920s, the Newby-McMahon Building was featured in Robert Ripley's ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' syndicated column as "the world's littlest skyscraper", which is a name that has stuck with it ever since.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN19990917/&gt;

The oil industry would ultimately prove to be a [[resource curse]] to Wichita Falls, and the [[Texas Oil Boom]] ended only a few years later. The building was vacated, boarded up, and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the [[Great Depression]] struck North Texas and office space became relatively inexpensive to lease or purchase.&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt; A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it unusable for a number of years.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt;

After the Great Depression, the building housed a succession of tenants, including barber shops and cafés. The building changed hands many times and was scheduled for demolition on several occasions, but escaped this fate apparently because a sufficient number of local residents came to its defense.&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt; It was eventually deeded to the city of Wichita Falls. As the building continued to deteriorate, in 1986 the city gave the building to the Wichita County Heritage Society (WCHS), with the hope that it would eventually be restored, making it a viable part of the Depot Square Historic District.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt;

==Purchase and renovation==
By 1999, the Newby-McMahon Building had proved to be an excessive burden on the limited capital reserves of the WCHS.&lt;ref name=WFTRN19990810/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN19991018/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN19991020/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20000806/&gt; The following year, the city council hired the local architectural firm of Bundy, Young, Sims &amp; Potter to stabilize the crumbling structure, amid steadily growing talk of demolishing the building.&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt; Dick Bundy and his partners became fascinated with the history and legacy of the building; they arranged a partnership with Marvin Groves Electric, another local business, to purchase the building.&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt; In December 2000, the city council voted to allow the WCHS to sell the building to Marvin Groves for $3,748.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20001216/&gt;

On June 11, 2003, a storm swept through Wichita Falls, bringing gusts of wind as strong as {{convert|97|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. A 15-ft (4.6-m) section of brick wall from the McMahon Building complex was knocked down.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20030614/&gt; The damage from this storm was repaired, but full restoration of the building and the adjacent Newby Building was delayed until late 2005. In June of that year, the City Council granted $25,000 in funds from the city's [[tax increment financing]] fund, to be invested in the restoration of the McMahon Building.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050619/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050622/&gt; Restoration of the building is estimated to have cost more than $254,000, the remainder of which was paid by the owners (Bundy, Young, Sims &amp; Potter, Inc. and Marvin Groves Electric).&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050619/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050622/&gt;

With the passage of time, the Newby-McMahon Building has become a monument to a long-gone era. It has survived tornadoes, a fire, and decades of neglect to stand as a monument to the greed, genius, graft, and gullibility of the [[oil boom]] days of [[North Texas]].&lt;ref name=OConnor1986/&gt; The building is currently part of the Depot Square Historic District of Wichita Falls,&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt; which has been declared a [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark|Texas Historic Landmark]] and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=WFTRN19990319/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Depot Square Historic District |work=Texas Historic Sites Atlas |publisher=[[Texas Historical Commission]] |url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/viewform.asp?atlas_num=2003001552 |accessdate=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building has never met the criteria for the definition of a [[skyscraper]],&lt;ref name=ESN24419/&gt; nor even that of a "[[Tower block|highrise]]" building.&lt;ref name=ESN18727/&gt; After its renovation, the building was home to an antiques dealership, the Antique Wood, which opened in 2006 on the ground floor.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050728/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20070326/&gt; Since 2013, besides being a local tourist attraction, a furniture and home décor consignment boutique, Hello Again has occupied the entire building.  At times, floors of the skyscraper have been subleased to various local artisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGinnis|first1=Judith|title=Downtown retail future gets boost from the past|publisher=Wichita Falls Times Record News|date=Feb 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Newby-McMahon Building is among several historic buildings featured in the documentary film ''Wichita Falls: The Future of Our Past'', a retrospective analysis of the city's architectural past produced in 2006 by Barry Levy, a public information officer with the city of Wichita Falls.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20061202/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4846">The '''Xputer''' is a design for a [[Reconfigurable computing|reconfigurable computer]], proposed by computer scientist Reiner Hartenstein. Hartenstein uses various terms to describe the various innovations in the design, including config-ware, flow-ware, morph-ware, and "anti-machine".

The Xputer represents a move away from the traditional [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] computer architecture, to a coarse-grained "soft [[Arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU)" architecture.&lt;ref name="b1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=692qqDaB1UwC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=rDPA+reconfigurable+datapath+array&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d1L75vdLZ6&amp;sig=6l1pGDN9QC8aBIk0-HLJrEkVe6s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=rDPA%20reconfigurable%20datapath%20array&amp;f=false Field-Programmable Logic: Architectures, Synthesis and Applications], Reiner W.

==Architecture ==
The Xputer architecture is data-stream-based, and is the counterpart of the [[Instruction set|instruction]]-based von Neumann computer architecture.

The Xputer architecture was one of the first coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures,&lt;ref name="b2"/&gt; and consists of a reconfigurable datapath array (rDPA) organized as a two-dimensional array of ALUs (rDPU).&lt;ref name="b2"/&gt; The bus-width between ALU's were 32-bit in the first version of the Xputer.&lt;ref name="b2"/&gt;

The ALUs (also known as rDPUs) are used for computing a single mathematical operation, such as addition, subtraction or multiplication, and can also be used purely for routing.&lt;ref name="b2"/&gt;

ALUs are mesh-connected via three types of connections, and data-flow along these connections are managed by an address generation unit.&lt;ref name="b2"/&gt;
*Nearest neighbour (connections between neighbouring ALUs)
*Row/column back-buses
*Global bus (a single global bus for interconnection between further ALUs)

Programs for the Xputer are written in the [[C (programming language)|C]] language, and compiled for usage on the Xputer using the CoDeX compiler written by the author.&lt;ref name="b2"/&gt; The CoDeX compiler maps suitable portions of the C program onto the Xputer's rDPA fabric.&lt;ref name="b2"/&gt; The remainder of the program is executed on the host system, such as a [[personal computer]].

==rDPA==
A '''reconfigurable datapath array''' (rDPA) is a [[semiconductor]] device containing reconfigurable data path units and programmable interconnects, first proposed by Rainer Kress in 1993, at the [[University of Kaiserslautern]].

Instead of [[FPGA]]s ([[field-programmable gate array]]s) having single bit configurable logic blocks (CLBs), rDPAs have multiple bits wide (for instance, 32 bit path width) reconfigurable datapath units (rDPUs).

Each rDPU can be configured to perform an individual function. These rDPUs and interconnects can be programmed after the manufacturing process by the customer/designer (hence the term "reconfigurable") so that the rDPA can perform whatever complex computation is needed. Because rDPUs are multiple bits wide (for instance, 32 bits), we talk about coarse-grained reconfigurability - in contrast to [[FPGA]]s with single-bit wide configurable logic blocks, called fine-gained reconfigurable.

rDPAs are structurally programmed from "config-ware" [[source code]], compiled into pipe-networks to be mapped onto the rDPA. rDPAs are not instruction-stream-driven and have no instruction fetch at run time. rDPUs do not have a program counter.&lt;ref name="b3"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DK5Z1j8SpAgC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=rDPA+reconfigurable+datapath+array&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JRpKhpR5_8&amp;sig=ICJU9NZRxVKFhbldpcrPHGh3tvU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=rDPA%20reconfigurable%20datapath%20array&amp;f=false Reconfigurable System Design and Verification], CRC Press, 17-Feb-2009&lt;/ref&gt;
