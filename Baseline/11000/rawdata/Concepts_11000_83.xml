      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2607">An '''adaptive algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] that changes its behavior at the time it is run, based on information available and on ''a priori'' defined reward mechanism (or criterion). Such information could be the story of recently received data, information on the available computational resources, or other run-time acquired (or ''a priori'' known) information related to the environment in which it operates.

Among the most used adaptive algorithms is the [[Least mean squares filter|Widrow-Hoff’s least mean squares (LMS)]], which represents a class of stochastic gradient-descent algorithms used in adaptive filtering and machine learning. In adaptive filtering the LMS is used to mimic a desired filter by finding the filter coefficients that relate to producing the least mean square  of the error signal (difference between the desired and the actual signal).

For example, [[stable partition]], using no additional memory is ''O''(''n'' lg ''n'') but given ''O''(''n'') memory, it can be ''O''(''n'') in time. As implemented by the [[C++ Standard Library]], [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/stable_partition &lt;code&gt;stable_partition&lt;/code&gt;] is adaptive and so it acquires as much memory as it can get (up to what it would need at most) and applies the algorithm using that available memory.  Another example is [[adaptive sort]], whose behavior changes upon the presortedness of its input.

An example of an adaptive algorithm in [[radar]] systems is the [[constant false alarm rate]] (CFAR) detector.

In [[machine learning]] and [[optimization]], many algorithms are adaptive or have adaptive variants, which usually means that the algorithm parameters are automatically adjusted according to statistics about the optimisation thus far (e.g. the rate of convergence). Examples include [[adaptive simulated annealing]], [[adaptive coordinate descent]], [[AdaBoost]], and [[adaptive quadrature]].

In [[data compression]], [[adaptive coding]] algorithms such as [[Adaptive Huffman coding]] or [[Prediction by partial matching]] can take a stream of data as input, and adapt their compression technique based on the symbols that they have already encountered.

In [[signal processing]], the [[Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding]] (ATRAC) codec used in [[MiniDisc]] recorders is called "adaptive" because the window length (the size of an audio "chunk") can change according to the nature of the sound being compressed, to try to achieve the best-sounding compression strategy.

In [[psychology]], an '''attribution bias''' or '''attributional bias''' is a [[cognitive bias]] that refers to the [[systematic error]]s made when people evaluate or try to find reasons for their own and others' behaviors.&lt;ref name="Heider"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heider|first=F.|date=1958|title=The psychology of interpersonal relations|location=New York|publisher=Wiley|page= 322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelley 1967"&gt;Kelley, H.H.

Rather than operating as objective perceivers, people are prone to perceptual errors that lead to biased interpretations of their social world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Funder | first1 = D.C. | year = 1987 | title = Errors and mistakes: Evaluating the accuracy of social judgment | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 101 | issue = 1| pages = 75–90 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.101.1.75 | pmid = 3562704 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nisbett and Ross 1980"&gt;Nisbett, R.E. &amp; Ross, L. (1980). ''Human inference: Strategies and shortcomings of social judgment'', Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attribution biases were first discussed in the 1950s and '60s by psychologists such as [[Fritz Heider]], who studied [[#Attribution theory|attribution theory]].&lt;ref name="Heider"/&gt; Other psychologists, such as [[#Harold Kelley|Harold Kelley]] and [[#Jones &amp; Davis|Ed Jones]] expanded Heider's early work by identifying conditions under which people are more or less likely to make different types of attributions.

Attribution biases are present in everyday life, and therefore are an important and relevant topic to study. For example, when a driver cuts us off, we are more likely to attribute blame to the reckless driver (e.g., "What a jerk!"), rather than situational circumstances (e.g., "Maybe they were in a rush and didn't notice me"). Additionally, there are many different [[#List of attributional biases|types]] of attribution biases, such as the [[ultimate attribution error]], [[#Fundamental attribution error|fundamental attribution error]], [[#Actor-observer bias|actor-observer bias]], and [[#Hostile attribution bias|hostile attribution bias]]. Each of these biases describes a specific tendency that people exhibit when reasoning about the cause of different behaviors.

Since the early work, researchers have continued to examine how and why people exhibit biased interpretations of social information.&lt;ref name="Kelley 1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones and Davis 1965"&gt;Jones, E.E. &amp; Davis, K.E. (1965). From acts to dispositions: the attribution process in social psychology. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.) ''Advances in experimental social psychology'', 2, 220–226. Florida: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; Many different types of attribution biases have been identified, and more recent psychological research on these biases has examined how attribution biases can subsequently affect emotions and behavior.&lt;ref name="Jones and Nisbett 1971"&gt;Jones, E.. &amp; Nisbett, R.E. (1971). ''The actor and the observer: Divergent perceptions of the causes of behaviors.''

==History==

===Attribution theory===
Research on [[#attribution bias|attribution biases]] is founded in [[attribution theory]], which was proposed to explain why and how we create meaning about others' and our own behavior. This theory focuses on identifying how an observer uses information in his/her social environment in order to create a causal explanation for events. Attribution theory also provides explanations for why different people can interpret the same event in different ways and what factors contribute to attribution biases.&lt;ref name="Himmelfarb 1974"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Himmelfarb | first1 = S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1974 | title = Attribution: Perceiving the causes of behavior | url = | journal = Behavioral Science | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 213–215 | doi=10.1002/bs.3830190308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fritz Heider====
Psychologist [[Fritz Heider]] first discussed attributions in his 1958 book, ''The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations''.&lt;ref name="Heider"/&gt; Heider made several important contributions that laid the foundation for further research on attribution theory and attribution biases. He noted that people tend to make distinctions between behaviors that are caused by personal disposition versus environmental or situational conditions. He also predicted that people are more likely to explain others' behavior in terms of dispositional factors (i.e., caused by a given person's personality), while ignoring the surrounding situational demands.

====Jones &amp; Davis====
Building on [[#Fritz Heider|Heider's]] early work, other psychologists in the 1960s and 70s extended work on attributions by offering additional related theories. In 1965, social psychologists Edward E. Jones and Keith Davis proposed an explanation for patterns of attribution termed ''correspondent inference theory''.&lt;ref name="Jones and Davis 1965"/&gt;  A 'correspondent inference' assumes that a person's behavior reflects a stable disposition or personality characteristic. They explained that certain conditions make us more likely to make a correspondent inference about someone's behavior:

;Intention: People are more likely to make a correspondent inference when they interpret someone's behavior as intentional, rather than unintentional.
;Social desirability: People are more likely to make a correspondent inference when an actor's behavior is socially undesirable than when it is conventional.
;Effects of behavior: People are more likely to make a correspondent, or dispositional, inference when someone else's actions yield outcomes that are rare or not yielded by other actions.

====Harold Kelley====
Soon after [[#Jones &amp; Davis|Jones and Davis]] first proposed their correspondent inference theory, [[Harold Kelley]], a social psychologist famous for his work on interdependence theory as well as attribution theory, proposed a ''covariation model'' to explain the way people make attributions.&lt;ref name="Kelley 1967"/&gt; This model helped to explain how people choose to attribute a behavior to an internal disposition versus an environmental factor. Kelley used the term 'covariation' to convey that when making attributions, people have access to information from many observations, across different situations, and at many time points; therefore, people can observe the way a behavior varies under these different conditions. He proposed three factors that influence the way we explain behavior:

* Consensus: The extent to which other people behave in the same way. There is high consensus when most people behave consistent with a given action/actor. Low consensus is when not many people behave in this way.
* Consistency: The extent to which a person usually behaves in a given way. There is high consistency when a person almost always behaves in a specific way. Low consistency is when a person almost never behaves like this.
* Distinctiveness: The extent to which an actor's behavior in one situation is different from his/her behavior in other situations. There is high distinctiveness when an actor does not behave this way in most situations. Low distinctiveness is when an actor usually behaves in a particular way in most situations.

Kelley proposed that people are more likely to make dispositional attributions when consensus is low (most other people don't behave in the same way), consistency is high (a person behaves this way across most situations), and distinctiveness is low (a person's behavior is not unique to this situation). Alternatively, situational attributions are more likely reached when consensus is high, consistency is low, and distinctiveness is high.&lt;ref name="Kelley 1973"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kelley | first1 = H.H. | year = 1973 | title = The process of causal attribution | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 107–128 | doi = 10.1037/h0034225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His research helped to reveal the specific mechanisms underlying the process of making attributions.

===Biased attributions===
As early researchers explored the way people make causal attributions, they also recognized that attributions do not necessarily reflect reality and can be colored by a person's own perspective.&lt;ref name="Jones and Nisbett 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Storms 1973"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Storms | first1 = M.D. | year = 1973 | title = Videotape and the attribution process: Reversing actors' and observers' points of view | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 165–175 | doi = 10.1037/h0034782 | pmid=4723963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain conditions can prompt people to exhibit attribution bias, or draw inaccurate conclusions about the cause of a given behavior or outcome. In his work on [[#Attribution theory|attribution theory]], [[#Fritz Heider|Fritz Heider]] noted that in ambiguous situations, people make attributions based on their own wants and needs, which are therefore often skewed.&lt;ref name="Heider"/&gt; He also explained that this tendency was rooted in a need to maintain a positive [[self-concept]], later termed the [[#Self-serving bias|self-serving bias]].

Kelley's covariation model also led to the acknowledgment of attribution biases.&lt;ref name="Kelley 1973"/&gt; The model explained the conditions under which people will make informed dispositional versus situational attributions. But, it assumed that people had access to such information (i.e., the consensus, consistency, and distinctiveness of a person's behavior). What about when we don't have access to such information, for example, when interacting with someone we don't know well? Lack of information results in a tendency to take cognitive shortcuts, resulting in different types of attribution biases, such as the [[#Actor-observer bias|actor-observer bias]] that will be discussed below.&lt;ref name="Jones and Nisbett 1971"/&gt;

====Cognitive explanation====
Although psychologists agreed that people are prone to these cognitive biases, there existed disagreement concerning the cause of such biases. On one hand, supporters of a "cognitive model" argued that biases were a product of human information processing constraints. One major proponent of this view was [[Yale]] psychologist Michael Storms, who proposed this cognitive explanation following his 1973 study of social perception.&lt;ref name="Storms 1973"/&gt; In his experiment, participants viewed a conversation between two individuals; we'll call them Actor one and Actor two. Some participants viewed the conversation while facing Actor one, such that they were unable to see the front of Actor two, while other participants viewed the conversation while facing Actor two, obstructed from the front of Actor one. Following the conversation, participants were asked to make attributions about the conversationalists. He found that participants ascribed more causal influence to the person they were looking at. In other words, participants made different attributions about people depending on the information they had access to. Storms used these results to bolster his theory of cognitively driven attribution biases; because we have no access to the world except for through our own eyes, we are inevitably constrained and consequently prone to biases. Similarly, social psychologist [[Anthony Greenwald]] described humans as possessing a ''totalitarian ego'', meaning that we view the world through our own personal selves.&lt;ref name="Greenwald 1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenwald | first1 = A.G. | year = 1973 | title = The totalitarian ego: Fabrication and revision of personal history | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 35 | issue = 7| pages = 603–618 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.35.7.603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, different people inevitably interpret the world differently and in turn reach different conclusions.

====Motivational explanation====
These views of attributional biases as being a sole product of information processing constraints received criticism from researchers who argued that humans do not just passively interpret their world and make attributions; rather, they are active and goal-driven. Building on this criticism, research began to focus on the role of motives in driving attribution biases.&lt;ref name="Tetlock and Levi 1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tetlock | first1 = P.E. | last2 = Levi | first2 = A. | year = 1982 | title = Attribution bias: On the inconclusiveness of the cognition-motivation debate | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 68–88 | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(82)90082-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers such as [[Ziva Kunda]] drew attention to the motivated aspects of attributions and attribution biases. Kunda in particular argued that certain biases only appear when people are presented with motivational pressures; therefore, they can't be exclusively explained by an objective cognitive process.&lt;ref name="Kunda 1987"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kunda | first1 = Z | year = 1987 | title = Motivated inference: Self-serving generation and evaluation of causal theories | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 636–647 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.4.636}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, we're more likely to construct biased social judgments when we're motivated to arrive at a particular conclusion, so long as we can justify this conclusion.&lt;ref name="Kunda 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kunda | first1 = Z | year = 1990 | title = The case for motivated reasoning | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 108 | issue = 3| pages = 480–498 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.53.4.636 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current theory==
Early researchers explained attribution biases as cognitively driven and a product of information processing errors. In the early 1980s, studies demonstrated that there may also be a motivational component to attribution biases, such that our own desires and emotions affect how we interpret social information.&lt;ref name="Kunda 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zuckerman 1979"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zuckerman, M.|year=1979|title=Attribution of success and failure revisited, or: The motivational bias is alive and well in attribution theory|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=47|issue=2|pages=245–287|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1979.tb00202.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current research continues to explore the validity of both of these explanations by examining the function of [[#Types of attribution biases|specific types of attribution biases]] and their behavioral correlates through a variety of methods (e.g., research with children or using [[fMRI|brain imaging techniques]]).&lt;ref name="Connolly and Bukszar 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Connolly, T.|author2=Bukszar, E.W.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1990|title=Hindsight bias: Self-flattery or cognitive error? |journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|volume=3|issue=3|pages=205–211|doi=10.1002/bdm.3960030305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Runions and Keating 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Runions, K.C.|author2=Keating, D.P.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2007|title=Children's social information processing: Family antecedents and behavioral correlates|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=43|issue=4|pages=838–849|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.43.4.838|pmid=17605518}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blackwood 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blackwood, N.J.|displayauthors=etal|year=2003|title=Self-responsibility and the self-serving bias: an fMRI investigation of causal attributions|journal=NeuroImage|volume=20|issue=2|pages=1076–1085|doi=10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00331-8|pmid=14568477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research on attribution biases has focused on identifying specific types of these biases and their effect on people's behavior.&lt;ref name="Crick and Dodge 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hewstone 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hewstone, M.|author2=Rubin, M.|author3= Willis, H.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|title=Intergroup bias|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=53|issue=1|pages=575–604|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135109|pmid=11752497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some psychologists have taken an [[applied psychology|applied]] approach and demonstrated how these biases can be understood in real-world contexts (e.g., the workplace or school).&lt;ref name="Perry 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Perry, R.P.|author2=Stupnisky, R.H.|author3=Hall, N.C.|author4=Chipperfield, J.G.|author5=Weiner, B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2010|title=Bad starts and better finishes: Attributional retraining and initial performance in competitive achievement settings|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume=29|issue=6|pages=668–700|doi=10.1521/jscp.2010.29.6.668}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martinko 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martinko, M.J.|author2=Harvey, P.|author3=Sikora, D.|author4=Douglas, S.C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=Perceptions of abusive supervision: The role of subordinates' attribution styles|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|volume=22|issue=4|pages=751–764|doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2011.05.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also used the theoretical framework of [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]]s and [[#attribution bias|attribution biases]] in order to modify the way people interpret social information. Studies have implemented [[#Academic achievement|attributional retraining]] to help, for example, students have more positive perceptions of their own academic abilities.&lt;ref name="Perry 2010"/&gt;

==Limitations of the theory==

There is much inconsistency in the claims made by scientists and researchers that attempt to prove or disprove attribution theories and the concept of attributional biases. The theory was formed as a comprehensive explanation of the way people interpret the basis of behaviors in human interactions. However, there have been studies that indicate cultural differences in the attribution biases between people of Eastern and Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Choi|first=I.|author2=Nisbett, R.E.|author3=Norenzayan, A.|title=Causal attribution across cultures: Variation and universality|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1999|pages=47–63|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.1.47|volume=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some scientists believe that attributional biases are only exhibited in certain contexts of interaction where possible outcomes or expectations make the forming of attributions necessary. These criticisms of the attribution model reveal that the theory may not be a general, universal principle.&lt;ref name="Manusov"&gt;{{cite book|title=Engaging Theories in Interpersonal Communication: Multiple Perspectives.|year=2008|publisher=Sage Publications.|author=Manusov, V.|author2=Spitzberg, B.|chapter=Attribution theory: Finding good cause in the search for theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Researchers have identified many different specific types of attribution biases, all of which describe ways in which people exhibit biased interpretations of information. Note that this is not an exhaustive list (see [[#List of attributional biases|List of attributional biases]] for more).

===Fundamental attribution error===
{{Main|Fundamental attribution error}}
The fundamental attribution error refers to a bias in explaining others' behaviors. According to this error, when we make attributions about another person's actions, we are likely to overemphasize the role of dispositional factors, while minimizing the influence of situational factors.&lt;ref name="Ross 1977"&gt;Ross, L. (1977). The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process. ''Advances in Experimental Social Psychology'', New York: Academic Press. pp. 173–220.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if we see a coworker bump into someone on his way to a meeting, we are more likely to explain this behavior in terms of our coworker's carelessness or hastiness, rather than considering that he was running late to a meeting.

This term was first proposed in the early 1970s by psychologist [[Lee Ross]] following an experiment he conducted with [[Edward E. Jones]] and Victor Harris in 1967.&lt;ref name="Jones and Harris 1967"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = E.E. | last2 = Harris | first2 = V.A. | year = 1967 | title = The attribution of attitudes . | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 1–24 | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(67)90034-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, participants were instructed to read two essays; one expressed pro-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] views, and the other expressed anti-Castro views. Participants were then asked to report their attitudes towards the writers under two separate conditions. When participants were informed that the writers voluntarily chose their position towards Castro, participants predictably expressed more positive attitudes towards the anti-Castro writer. However, when participants were told that the writers' positions were determined by a coin toss, rather than their own free will, participants continued to express more positive attitudes towards the anti-Castro writer. These results demonstrated that participants did not take situational factors into account when evaluating a third party, providing evidence of what was later coined the fundamental attribution error.

===Actor-observer bias===
{{Main|Actor–observer asymmetry}}
The actor-observer bias (also actor–observer asymmetry) can be thought of as an extension of the fundamental attribution error. According to the actor-observer bias, in addition to over-valuing dispositional explanations of others' behaviors, we tend to under-value dispositional explanations and over-value situational explanations of our ''own'' behavior. For example, a student who studies may explain her behavior by referencing situational factors (e.g., "I have an exam coming up"), whereas others will explain her studying by referencing dispositional factors (e.g., "She's ambitious and hard-working").  This bias was first proposed by [[Edward E. Jones]] and [[Richard E. Nisbett]] in 1971, who explained that "actors tend to attribute the causes of their behavior to stimuli inherent in the situation, while observers tend to attribute behavior to stable dispositions of the actor."&lt;ref name="Jones and Nisbett 1971"/&gt;

There has been some controversy over the theoretical foundation of the actor-observer bias. In a 2006 meta-analysis of all published studies of the bias since 1971, the author found that Jones' and Nisbett's original explanation did not hold.&lt;ref name="Malle 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Malle | first1 = B.F. | year = 2006 | title = The actor-observer asymmetry in attribution: A surprising meta-analysis | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 132 | issue = 6| pages = 895–919 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.132.6.895 | pmid=17073526}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas Jones and Nisbett proposed that actors and observers explain behaviors as attributions to either dispositions or situational factors, examining past studies revealed that this assumption may be flawed. Rather, the theoretical reformulation posits that the way we explain behavior depends on whether or not it is intentional, among other things. For more information on this theoretical reformulation, see [[Actor–observer asymmetry|actor-observer asymmetry]], or refer to Malle's meta-analysis in [[#Further reading]].

===Self-serving bias===
{{Main|Self-serving bias}}
A self-serving bias refers to people's tendency to attribute their successes to internal factors but attribute their failures to external.&lt;ref name="Darity 2008"&gt;Darity, W.A. (2008). "International encyclopedia of the social sciences." Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA.&lt;/ref&gt; This bias helps to explain why we tend to take credit for our successes while often denying any responsibility for failures. For example, a tennis player who wins his match might say, "I won because I'm a good athlete," whereas the loser might say, "I lost because the referee was unfair."

The self-serving bias has been thought of as a means of self-esteem maintenance.&lt;ref name="Larson 1977"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larson | first1 = J.R. | year = 1977 | title = Evidence for a self-serving bias in the attribution of causality | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 430–441 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1977.tb00162.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, we feel better about ourselves by taking credit for successes and creating external blames for failure. This is further reinforced by research showing that as self-threat increases, people are more likely to exhibit a self-serving bias.&lt;ref name="Campbell and Sedikides 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = W.K.C. | last2 = Sedikides | first2 = C. | year = 1999 | title = Self-threat magnifies the self-serving bias: A meta-analytic integration | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 23–43 | doi = 10.1037/1089-2680.3.1.23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, participants who received negative feedback on a laboratory task were more likely to attribute their task performance to external, rather than internal, factors. Therefore, the self-serving bias seems to function as an [[Defence mechanisms|ego-protection mechanism]], helping people to better cope with personal failures.

===Hostile attribution bias===
{{Main|Hostile attribution bias}}
{{See also|Ideas of reference and delusions of reference}}
Hostile attribution bias (HAB) has been defined as an [[interpretive bias]] wherein individuals exhibit a tendency to interpret others' ambiguous behaviors as hostile, rather than benign.&lt;ref name="Crick and Dodge 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Camodeca 2003"/&gt; For example, if a child witnesses two other children whispering and assumes they are talking about him/her, that child makes an attribution of hostile intent, even though the other children's behavior was potentially benign. Research has indicated that there is an association between hostile attribution bias and [[aggression]], such that people who are more likely to interpret someone else's behavior as hostile are also more likely to engage in aggressive behavior.&lt;ref name="Steinberg and Dodge 1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steinberg | first1 = M.S. | last2 = Dodge | first2 = K.A. | year = 1983 | title = Attributional bias in aggressive adolescent boys and girls | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 312–321 | doi = 10.1521/jscp.1983.1.4.312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Camodeca 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Camodeca | first1 = M. | last2 = Goossens | first2 = F.A. | year = 2005 | title = Aggression, social cognitions, anger and sadness in bullies and victims | url = https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/26cb5aac-177b-41d1-aace-0988ccf91679| journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 186–197 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00347.x | pmid = 15679527 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; See the following section on [[#Aggression|aggression]] for more details on this association.

==Consequences for behavior==

===Aggression===
Extensive research in both [[social psychology|social]] and [[developmental psychology]] has examined the relationship between aggressive behavior and attribution biases, with a specific focus on the [[#Hostile attribution bias|hostile attribution bias]].&lt;ref name="Steinberg and Dodge 1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Camodeca 2005"/&gt;

In particular, researchers have consistently found that children who exhibit a hostile attribution bias (tendency to perceive others' intent as hostile, as opposed to benign) are more likely to engage in aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref name="Crick and Dodge 1996"/&gt; More specifically, hostile attribution bias has been associated with reactive aggression, as opposed to proactive aggression, as well as [[victimization]].  Whereas proactive aggression is unprovoked and goal-driven, reactive aggression is an angry, retaliatory response to some sort of perceived provocation.&lt;ref name="Dodge and Coie 1987"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dodge | first1 = K.A. | last2 = Coie | first2 = J.D. | year = 1987 | title = Social-information-processing factors in reactive and proactive aggression in children's peer groups | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = 6| pages = 1146–1158 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.53.6.1146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, children who are victims of aggression may develop views of peers as hostile, leading them to be more likely to engage in retaliatory, or reactive, aggression.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = D. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1998 | title = Social-cognitive and behavioral correlates of aggression and victimization in boys' play groups | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 431–440 | doi = 10.1023/A:1022695601088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also indicated that children can develop hostile attribution bias by engaging in aggression in the context of a video game.&lt;ref name="Kirsh 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirsh | first1 = S.J. | year = 1998 | title = Seeing the world through Mortal Kombat-colored glasses: Violent video games and the development of a short-term hostile attribution bias | url = | journal = Childhood | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 177–184 | doi = 10.1177/0907568298005002005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1998 study, participants played either a very violent or non-violent video game and were then asked to read several hypothetical stories where a peer's intent was ambiguous. For example, participants may read about their peer hitting someone in the head with a ball, but it is unclear whether or not the peer did this intentionally or not. Participants then responded to questions about their peer's intent (e.g., "Do you think your peer hit someone with the ball on purpose?"). The children who played the violent video game, as compared to participants who played the nonviolent game, were more likely to say that their peer harmed someone on purpose. This finding provided evidence that just playing a violent video game could cause children to develop a short-term hostile attribution bias.

===Intergroup relations===
Research has found that we often exhibit attribution biases when interpreting the behavior of others, and specifically when explaining the behavior of in-group versus out-group members. More specifically, a review of the literature on intergroup attribution biases noted that people generally favor dispositional explanations of an in-group member's positive behavior and situational explanations for an in-group's negative behavior.&lt;ref name="Hewstone 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hewstone | first1 = M | year = 1990 | title = The 'ultimate attribution error'? A review of the literature on intergroup causal attribution | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 311–335 | doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2420200404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, people are more likely to do the opposite when explaining the behavior of an out-group member (i.e., attribute positive behavior to situational factors and negative behavior to disposition). Essentially, group members' attributions tend to favor the in-group. This finding has important implications for understanding other social psychological topics, such as the development and persistence of out-group [[stereotype]]s.&lt;ref name="Hewstone 2002"/&gt;

Attribution biases in intergroup relations are also observed as early as childhood. In particular, elementary school students are more likely to make dispositional attributions when their friends perform positive behaviors, but situational attributions when disliked peers perform positive behaviors. Similarly, children are more likely to attribute friends' negative behaviors to situational factors, whereas they attribute disliked peers' negative behaviors to dispositional factors.&lt;ref name="Guerin 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerin | first1 = B | year = 1999 | title = Children's intergroup attribution bias for liked and disliked peers | url = | journal = The Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 139 | issue = 5| pages = 583–589 | doi = 10.1080/00224549909598418 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings provide evidence that attribution biases emerge as early as childhood.

===Academic achievement===
Although certain attribution biases are associated with maladaptive behaviors, such as aggression, some research has also indicated that these biases are flexible and can be altered to produce positive outcomes. Much of this work falls within the domain of improving academic achievement through attributional retraining. For example, one study found that students who were taught to modify their attributions actually performed better on homework assignments and lecture materials.&lt;ref name="Perry and Penner 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perry | first1 = R.P. | last2 = Penner | first2 = K.S. | year = 1990 | title = Enhancing academic achievement in college students through attributional retraining and instruction | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 82 | issue = 2| pages = 262–271 | doi = 10.1037/0022-0663.82.2.262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The retraining process specifically targeted students who tended to attribute poor academic performance to external factors and taught them that poor performance was often attributable to internal and unstable factors, such as effort and ability. Therefore, the retraining helped students perceive greater control over their own academic success by altering their attributional process.

More recent research has extended these findings and examined the value of attributional retraining for helping students adjust to an unfamiliar and competitive setting. In one study, first year college students went through attributional retraining following their first exam in a two-semester course.&lt;ref name="Perry 2010"/&gt; Similar to the previous study, they were taught to make more controllable attributions (e.g., "I can improve my test grade by studying more") and less uncontrollable attributions (e.g., "No matter what I do, I'll fail"). For students who performed low or average on their first exam, attributional retraining resulted in higher in-class test grades and GPA in the second semester. Students who performed well on the first exam were found to have more positive emotions in the second semester, following attributional retraining. Taken together, these studies provide evidence for the flexibility and modifiability of attributional biases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3481">An '''autonomous agent''' is an ''intelligent agent'' operating on an owner's behalf but without any interference of that ownership entity. An [[Intelligent agent]], however appears according to a multiply cited statement in a no longer accessible [[IBM]] white paper as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intelligent agents are software entities that carry out some set of operations on behalf of a user or another program with some degree of independence or autonomy, and in so doing, employ some knowledge or representation of the user's goals or desires.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such an agent is a system situated in, and part of, a technical or natural environment, which senses any or some status of that environment, and acts on it in pursuit of its own agenda. Such an agenda evolves from [[drive theory|drives]] (or programmed [[objective (goal)|goals]]). The agent acts to change part of the environment or of its status and influences what it sensed.

Non-biological examples include [[intelligent agent]]s, [[autonomous robot]]s, and various [[software agent]]s, including [[artificial life]] agents, and many [[computer virus]]es. Biological examples are not yet defined.

{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}
An '''axiom''' or '''postulate''' is a statement that is taken to be [[truth|true]], to serve as a [[premise]] or starting point for further reasoning and arguments. The word comes from the Greek ''axíōma'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἀξίωμα}}}}) 'that which is thought worthy or fit' or 'that which commends itself as evident.'&lt;ref&gt;Cf. axiom, n., etymology. ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed 2012-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford American College Dictionary: "n. a statement or proposition that is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. ORIGIN: late 15th cent.: ultimately from Greek axiōma 'what is thought fitting,' from axios 'worthy.' http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1O997-axiom.html {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has subtle differences in definition when used in the context of different fields of study. As defined in [[classic philosophy]], an axiom is a statement that is so [[Self-evidence|evident]] or well-established, that it is accepted without controversy or question.&lt;ref&gt;"A proposition that commends itself to general acceptance; a well-established or universally conceded principle; a maxim, rule, law" axiom, n., definition 1a. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Online, accessed 2012-04-28. Cf. Aristotle, ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' I.2.72a18-b4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- HIDDEN UNTIL SOURCED —it is better known and more firmly believed than the conclusion.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}--&gt; As used in modern [[logic]], an axiom is a premise or starting point for reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;"A proposition (whether true or false)" axiom, n., definition 2. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Online, accessed 2012-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
As used in [[mathematics]], the term ''axiom'' is used in two related but distinguishable senses: [[#Logical axioms|"logical axioms"]] and [[#Non-logical axioms|"non-logical axioms"]]. Logical axioms are usually statements that are taken to be true within the system of logic they define (e.g., (''A'' and ''B'') implies ''A''), often shown in symbolic form, while non-logical axioms (e.g., {{nowrap|1= ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}}) are actually substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of a specific mathematical theory (such as [[arithmetic]]). When used in the latter sense, "axiom", "postulate", and "assumption" may be used interchangeably. In general, a non-logical axiom is not a self-evident truth, but rather a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory.  To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms). There are typically multiple ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain.

Any axiom is a statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived.  Whether it is meaningful (and, if so, what it means) for an axiom to be "true" is a subject of debate in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{cite journal|first=Penelope|last=Maddy|journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|title=Believing the Axioms, I|volume=53|issue=2|date=Jun 1988|pages=481–511|doi=10.2307/2274520}} for a [[mathematical realism|realist]] view.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''axiom'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἀξίωμα}} (''axíōma''), a [[verbal noun]] from the verb {{lang|grc|ἀξιόειν}} (''axioein''), meaning "to deem worthy", but also "to require", which in turn comes from {{lang|grc|ἄξιος}} (''áxios''), meaning "being in balance", and hence "having (the same) value (as)", "worthy", "proper". Among the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]]s an axiom was a claim which could be seen to be true without any need for proof.

The root meaning of the word ''postulate'' is to "demand"; for instance, [[Euclid]] demands that one agree that some things can be done, e.g. any two points can be joined by a straight line, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, P. ''Breakthroughs in Mathematics'', 1963, New York: New American Library, pp&amp;nbsp;47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient geometers maintained some distinction between axioms and postulates. While commenting on Euclid's books, [[Proclus]] remarks that, "[[Geminus]] held that this [4th] Postulate should not be classed as a postulate but as an axiom, since it does not, like the first three Postulates, assert the possibility of some construction but expresses an essential property."&lt;ref&gt;[[T. L. Heath|Heath, T.]] 1956. The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements. New York: Dover. ''p 200''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boethius]] translated 'postulate' as ''petitio'' and called the axioms  ''notiones communes'' but in later manuscripts this usage was not always strictly kept.

==Historical development==

===Early Greeks===
The logico-deductive method whereby conclusions (new knowledge) follow from premises (old knowledge) through the application of sound arguments ([[syllogisms]], rules of inference), was developed by the ancient Greeks, and has become the core principle of modern mathematics. [[tautology (logic)|Tautologies]] excluded, nothing can be deduced if nothing is assumed. Axioms and postulates are the basic assumptions underlying a given body of deductive knowledge. They are accepted without demonstration. All other assertions ([[theorem]]s, if we are talking about mathematics) must be proven with the aid of these basic assumptions. However, the interpretation of mathematical knowledge has changed from ancient times to the modern, and consequently the terms ''axiom'' and ''postulate'' hold a slightly different meaning for the present day mathematician, than they did for [[Aristotle]] and [[Euclid]].

The ancient Greeks considered [[geometry]] as just one of several [[science]]s, and held the theorems of geometry on par with scientific facts. As such, they developed and used the logico-deductive method as a means of avoiding error, and for structuring and communicating knowledge. Aristotle's [[posterior analytics]] is a definitive exposition of the classical view.

An "axiom", in classical terminology, referred to a self-evident assumption common to many branches of science. A good example would be the assertion that &lt;blockquote&gt;''When an equal amount is taken from equals, an equal amount results.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the foundation of the various sciences lay certain additional hypotheses which were accepted without proof. Such a hypothesis was termed a ''postulate''. While the axioms were common to many sciences, the postulates of each particular science were different. Their validity had to be established by means of real-world experience. Indeed, Aristotle warns that the content of a science cannot be successfully communicated, if the learner is in doubt about the truth of the postulates.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Metaphysics Bk IV, Chapter 3, 1005b "Physics also is a kind of Wisdom, but it is not the first kind. – And the attempts of some of those who discuss the terms on which truth should be accepted, are due to want of training in logic; for they should know these things already when they come to a special study, and not be inquiring into them while they are listening to lectures on it." W.D. Ross translation, in The Basic Works of Aristotle, ed. Richard McKeon, (Random House, New York, 1941)|date=June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical approach is well-illustrated by [[Euclid's Elements]], where a list of postulates is given (common-sensical geometric facts drawn from our experience), followed by a list of "common notions" (very basic, self-evident assertions).

:;Postulates
:# It is possible to draw a [[straight line]] from any point to any other point.
:# It is possible to extend a line segment continuously in both directions.
:# It is possible to describe a [[circle]] with any center and any radius.
:# It is true that all [[right angle]]s are equal to one another.
:# ("[[Parallel postulate]]") It is true that, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the [[polygon|interior angles]] on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, [[Line-line intersection|intersect]] on that side on which are the [[angle]]s less than the two right angles.

:;Common notions:
:# Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.
:# If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.
:# If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.
:# Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.
:# The whole is greater than the part.

===Modern development===
A lesson learned by mathematics in the last 150 years is that it is useful to strip the meaning away from the mathematical assertions (axioms, postulates, [[propositional logic|propositions]], theorems) and definitions. One must concede the need for [[primitive notion]]s, or undefined terms or concepts, in any study. Such abstraction or formalization makes mathematical knowledge more general, capable of multiple different meanings, and therefore useful in multiple contexts. [[Alessandro Padoa]], [[Mario Pieri]], and [[Giuseppe Peano]] were pioneers in this movement.

Structuralist mathematics goes further, and develops theories and axioms (e.g. [[Field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], [[group (mathematics)|group theory]], [[topological space|topology]], [[linear space|vector spaces]]) without ''any'' particular application in mind. The distinction between an "axiom" and a "postulate" disappears. The postulates of Euclid are profitably motivated by saying that they lead to a great wealth of geometric facts. The truth of these complicated facts rests on the acceptance of the basic hypotheses. However, by throwing out Euclid's fifth postulate we get theories that have meaning in wider contexts, [[hyperbolic geometry]] for example. We must simply be prepared to use labels like "line" and "parallel" with greater flexibility. The development of hyperbolic geometry taught mathematicians that postulates should be regarded as purely formal statements, and not as facts based on experience.

When mathematicians employ the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] axioms, the intentions are even more abstract. The propositions of field theory do not concern any one particular application; the mathematician now works in complete abstraction. There are many examples of fields; field theory gives correct knowledge about them all.

It is not correct to say that the axioms of field theory are "propositions that are regarded as true without proof." Rather, the field axioms are a set of constraints. If any given system of addition and multiplication satisfies these constraints, then one is in a position to instantly know a great deal of extra information about this system.

Modern mathematics formalizes its foundations to such an extent that mathematical theories can be regarded as mathematical objects, and mathematics itself can be regarded as a branch of [[logic]]. [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], and [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] are some of the key figures in this development.

In the modern understanding, a set of axioms is any [[Class (set theory)|collection]] of formally stated assertions from which other formally stated assertions follow by the application of certain well-defined rules. In this view, logic becomes just another formal system. A set of axioms should be [[consistent]]; it should be impossible to derive a contradiction from the axiom. A set of axioms should also be non-redundant; an assertion that can be deduced from other axioms need not be regarded as an axiom.

It was the early hope of modern logicians that various branches of mathematics, perhaps all of mathematics, could be derived from a consistent collection of basic axioms. An early success of the formalist program was Hilbert's formalization of [[Euclidean geometry]], and the related demonstration of the consistency of those axioms.

In a wider context, there was an attempt to base all of mathematics on [[Georg Cantor|Cantor's]] [[set theory]]. Here the emergence of [[Russell's paradox]], and similar antinomies of [[naïve set theory]] raised the possibility that any such system could turn out to be inconsistent.

The formalist project suffered a decisive setback, when in 1931 Gödel showed that it is possible, for any sufficiently large set of axioms ([[peano arithmetic|Peano's axioms]], for example) to construct a statement whose truth is independent of that set of axioms. As a [[corollary]], Gödel proved that the consistency of a theory like [[Peano arithmetic]] is an unprovable assertion within the scope of that theory.

It is reasonable to believe in the consistency of Peano arithmetic because it is satisfied by the system of [[natural number]]s, an [[Infinite set|infinite]] but intuitively accessible formal system. However, at present, there is no known way of demonstrating the consistency of the modern [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]] for set theory. Furthermore, using techniques of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] ([[Paul Cohen|Cohen]]) one can show that the [[continuum hypothesis]] (Cantor) is independent of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms. Thus, even this very general set of axioms cannot be regarded as the definitive foundation for mathematics.

===Other sciences===
Axioms play a key role not only in mathematics, but also in other sciences, notably in [[theoretical physics]]. In particular, the monumental work of [[Isaac Newton]] is essentially based on [[Euclid]]'s axioms, augmented by a postulate on the non-relation of [[spacetime]] and the physics taking place in it at any moment.

In 1905, Newton's axioms were replaced by those of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]], and later on by those of [[general relativity]].

Another paper of Albert Einstein and coworkers (see [[EPR paradox]]), almost immediately contradicted by [[Niels Bohr]], concerned the interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]]. This was in 1935. According to Bohr, this new theory should be [[Probability theory|probabilistic]], whereas according to Einstein it should be [[deterministic]]. Notably, the underlying quantum mechanical theory, i.e. the set of "theorems" derived by it, seemed to be identical.  Einstein even assumed that it would be sufficient to add to quantum mechanics  "hidden variables" to enforce determinism. However,  thirty years later, in 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] found a theorem, involving complicated optical correlations (see [[Bell inequalities]]), which yielded measurably different results using Einstein's axioms compared to using Bohr's axioms. And it took roughly another twenty years until an experiment of [[Alain Aspect]] got results in favour of Bohr's axioms, not Einstein's. (Bohr's axioms are simply: The theory should be probabilistic in the sense of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]].)

As a consequence, it is not necessary to explicitly cite Einstein's axioms, the more so since they concern subtle points on the "reality" and "locality" of experiments.

Regardless, the role of axioms in mathematics and in the above-mentioned sciences is different. In mathematics one neither "proves" nor "disproves" an axiom for a set of theorems; the point is simply that in the conceptual realm identified by the axioms, the theorems logically follow. In contrast, in physics a comparison with experiments always makes sense, since a [[Falsifiability|falsified]] physical theory needs modification.

==Mathematical logic==
In the field of [[mathematical logic]], a clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms: ''logical'' and ''non-logical'' (somewhat similar to the ancient distinction between "axioms" and "postulates" respectively).

===Logical axioms===
These are certain [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] in a [[formal language]] that are [[tautology (logic)|universally valid]], that is, formulas that are [[satisfiability|satisfied]] by every [[Assignment (mathematical logic)|assignment]] of values.  Usually one takes as logical axioms ''at least'' some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] in the language; in the case of [[predicate logic]] more logical axioms than that are required, in order to prove [[logical truth]]s that are not tautologies in the strict sense.

====Examples====

=====Propositional logic=====
In [[propositional logic]] it is common to take as logical axioms all formulae of the following forms, where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; can be any formulae of the language and where the included [[Logical connective|primitive connectives]] are only "&lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;" for [[negation]] of the immediately following proposition and "&lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt;" for [[Entailment|implication]] from antecedent to consequent propositions:

#&lt;math&gt;\phi \to (\psi \to \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\phi \to (\psi \to \chi)) \to ((\phi \to \psi) \to (\phi \to \chi))&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\lnot \phi \to \lnot \psi) \to (\psi \to \phi).&lt;/math&gt;

Each of these patterns is an ''[[axiom schema]]'', a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms.  For example, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are [[propositional variable]]s, then &lt;math&gt;A \to (B \to A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A \to \lnot B) \to (C \to (A \to \lnot B))&lt;/math&gt; are both instances of axiom schema 1, and hence are axioms.  It can be shown that with only these three axiom schemata and ''[[modus ponens]]'', one can prove all tautologies of the propositional calculus.  It can also be shown that no pair of these schemata is sufficient for proving all tautologies with ''modus ponens''.

Other axiom schemas involving the same or different sets of primitive connectives can be alternatively constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, "6. Other Axiomatizations" of Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

These axiom schemata are also used in the [[predicate calculus]], but additional logical axioms are needed to include a quantifier in the calculus.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, "3. First-Order Theories" of Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=====First-order logic=====
&lt;div style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; "&gt;
'''Axiom of Equality.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[first-order language]]. For each variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x = x&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

This means that, for any [[Free variables and bound variables|variable symbol]] &lt;math&gt;x\,,&lt;/math&gt; the formula &lt;math&gt;x = x&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as an axiom. Also, in this example, for this not to fall into vagueness and a never-ending series of "primitive notions", either a precise notion of what we mean by &lt;math&gt;x = x&lt;/math&gt;  (or, for that matter, "to be equal") has to be well established first, or a purely formal and syntactical usage of the symbol &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;  has to be enforced, only regarding it as a string and only a string of symbols, and mathematical logic does indeed do that.

Another, more interesting example [[axiom scheme]], is that which provides us with what is known as '''Universal Instantiation''':

&lt;div style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; "&gt;
'''Axiom scheme for Universal Instantiation.''' Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in a first-order language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}&lt;/math&gt;, a variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and a [[First order logic#Terms|term]] &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; that is [[First-order logic#Rules of inference|substitutable]] for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\forall x \, \phi \to \phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

Where the symbol &lt;math&gt;\phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt; stands for the formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; with the term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; substituted for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. (See [[Substitution of variables]].) In informal terms, this example allows us to state that, if we know that a certain property &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; holds for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; stands for a particular object in our structure, then we should be able to claim &lt;math&gt;P(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Again, ''we are claiming that the formula'' &lt;math&gt;\forall x \phi \to \phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt; ''is valid'', that is, we must be able to give a "proof" of this fact, or more properly speaking, a ''metaproof''. Actually, these examples are ''metatheorems'' of our theory of mathematical logic since we are dealing with the very concept of ''proof'' itself. Aside from this, we can also have '''Existential Generalization''':

&lt;div style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; "&gt;
'''Axiom scheme for Existential Generalization.''' Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in a first-order language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}&lt;/math&gt;, a variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and a term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; that is substitutable for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\phi^x_t \to \exists x \, \phi&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Non-logical axioms===
'''Non-logical axioms''' are formulas that play the role of theory-specific assumptions.  Reasoning about two different structures, for example the [[natural number]]s and the [[integer]]s, may involve the same logical axioms; the non-logical axioms aim to capture what is special about a particular structure (or set of structures, such as [[group (algebra)|groups]]).  Thus non-logical axioms, unlike logical axioms, are not ''[[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]]''.  Another name for a non-logical axiom is ''postulate''.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, "3. First-Order Theories: Proper Axioms" of Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost every modern [[mathematical theory]] starts from a given set of non-logical axioms, and it was thought{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} that in principle every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas.&lt;!-- This turned out to be impossible{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} and proved to be quite a story (''[[#role|see below]]''); however recently this approach has been resurrected in the form of [[neo-logicism]].--&gt;

Non-logical axioms are often simply referred to as ''axioms'' in mathematical [[discourse]].  This does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense.  For example, in some groups, the group operation is [[commutative]], and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom, but without this axiom we can do quite well developing (the more general) group theory, and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non-commutative groups.

Thus, an ''axiom'' is an elementary basis for a [[Formal system#Logical system|formal logic system]] that together with the [[rules of inference]] define a '''[[deductive system]]'''.

====Examples====
This section gives examples of mathematical theories that are developed entirely from a set of non-logical axioms (axioms, henceforth). A rigorous treatment of any of these topics begins with a specification of these axioms.

Basic theories, such as [[arithmetic]], [[real analysis]] and [[complex analysis]] are often introduced non-axiomatically, but implicitly or explicitly there is generally an assumption that the axioms being used are the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with choice, abbreviated ZFC, or some very similar system of [[axiomatic set theory]] like [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], a [[conservative extension]] of ZFC. Sometimes slightly stronger theories such as [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] or set theory with a [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]] allowing the use of a [[Grothendieck universe]] are used, but in fact most mathematicians can actually prove all they need in systems weaker than ZFC, such as [[second-order arithmetic]].{{citation needed|reason=This claim should include a citation |date=April 2016}}

The study of topology in mathematics extends all over through [[point set topology]], [[algebraic topology]], [[differential topology]], and all the related paraphernalia, such as [[homology theory]], [[homotopy theory]]. The development of ''abstract algebra'' brought with itself [[group theory]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[Galois theory]].

This list could be expanded to include most fields of mathematics, including [[measure theory]], [[ergodic theory]], [[probability]], [[representation theory]], and [[differential geometry]].

=====Arithmetic=====
The [[Peano axioms]] are the most widely used ''axiomatization'' of [[first-order arithmetic]].  They are a set of axioms strong enough to prove many important facts about [[number theory]] and they allowed Gödel to establish his famous [[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem|second incompleteness theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, "5. The Fixed Point Theorem. Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem" of Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

We have a language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}_{NT} = \{0, S\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is a constant symbol and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[unary function]] and the following axioms:

# &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \lnot (Sx = 0) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \forall y. (Sx = Sy \to x = y) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(\phi(0) \land \forall x.\,(\phi(x) \to \phi(Sx))) \to \forall x.\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}_{NT}&lt;/math&gt; formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; with one free variable.

The standard structure is &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N} = \langle\N, 0, S\rangle&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\N&lt;/math&gt; is the set of natural numbers, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the [[successor function]] and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is naturally interpreted as the number 0.

=====Euclidean geometry=====
Probably the oldest, and most famous, list of axioms are the 4 + 1 [[Euclid's postulates]] of [[Euclidean geometry|plane geometry]].  The axioms are referred to as "4 + 1" because for nearly two millennia the [[parallel postulate|fifth (parallel) postulate]] ("through a point outside a line there is exactly one parallel") was suspected of being derivable from the first four.  Ultimately, the fifth postulate was found to be independent of the first four.  Indeed, one can assume that exactly one parallel through a point outside a line exists, or that infinitely many exist.  This choice gives us two alternative forms of geometry in which the interior [[angle]]s of a [[triangle]] add up to exactly 180 degrees or less, respectively, and are known as Euclidean and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] geometries. If one also removes the second postulate ("a line can be extended indefinitely") then [[elliptic geometry]] arises, where there is no parallel through a point outside a line, and in which the interior angles of a triangle add up to more than 180 degrees.

=====Real analysis=====
The objectives of study are within the domain of [[real numbers]].  The real numbers are uniquely picked out (up to [[isomorphism]]) by the properties of a ''Dedekind complete ordered field'', meaning that any nonempty set of real numbers with an upper bound has a least upper bound. However, expressing these properties as axioms requires use of [[second-order logic]]. The [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]]s tell us that if we restrict ourselves to [[first-order logic]], any axiom system for the reals admits other models, including both models that are smaller than the reals and models that are larger.  Some of the latter are studied in [[non-standard analysis]].

===&lt;span id="role"&gt;Role in mathematical logic&lt;/span&gt;===

====Deductive systems and completeness====
A '''[[deductive]] system''' consists of a set &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; of logical axioms, a set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of non-logical axioms, and a set &lt;math&gt;\{(\Gamma, \phi)\}&lt;/math&gt; of ''rules of inference''.  A desirable property of a deductive system is that it be '''complete'''.  A system is said to be complete if, for all formulas &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\text{if }\Sigma \models \phi\text{ then }\Sigma \vdash \phi&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

that is, for any statement that is a ''logical consequence'' of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; there actually exists a ''deduction'' of the statement from &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.  This is sometimes expressed as "everything that is true is provable", but it must be understood that "true" here means "made true by the set of axioms", and not, for example, "true in the intended interpretation". [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] establishes the completeness of a certain commonly used type of deductive system.

Note that "completeness" has a different meaning here than it does in the context of [[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]], which states that no ''recursive'', ''consistent'' set of non-logical axioms &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of the Theory of Arithmetic is ''complete'', in the sense that there will always exist an arithmetic statement &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; such that neither &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;\lnot\phi&lt;/math&gt; can be proved from the given set of axioms.

There is thus, on the one hand, the notion of ''completeness of a deductive system'' and on the other hand that of ''completeness of a set of non-logical axioms''.  The completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem, despite their names, do not contradict one another.

===Further discussion===
Early [[mathematician]]s regarded [[Foundations of geometry|axiomatic geometry]] as a model of [[physical space]], and obviously there could only be one such model. The idea that alternative mathematical systems might exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the 19th century and the developers of systems such as [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] made elaborate efforts to derive them from traditional arithmetic. [[Évariste Galois|Galois]] showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted. Ultimately, the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than the details and [[abstract algebra|modern algebra]] was born.  In the modern view axioms may be any set of formulas, as long as they are not known to be inconsistent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1874">In U.S. law, the '''bad tendency''' principle is a test which permits restriction of [[freedom of speech]] by government if it is believed that a form of speech has a sole tendency to incite or cause illegal activity. The principle, formulated in ''[[Patterson v. Colorado]]'', (1907) was seemingly overturned with the "[[clear and present danger]]" principle used in the landmark case ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'' (1919), as stated by Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] Yet eight months later, at the start of the next term in ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'' (1919) the Court again used the bad tendency test to uphold the conviction of a Russian immigrant who published and distributed leaflets calling for a [[general strike]] and otherwise advocated revolutionary, anarchist, and socialist views. Holmes dissented in ''Abrams'', explaining how the ''clear and present danger test'' should be employed to overturn Abrams' conviction. The arrival of the "bad tendency" test resulted in a string of [[political correctness|politically incorrect]] rulings such as ''[[Whitney v. California]]'' (1927), where a woman was convicted simply because of her association with the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]. The court ruled unanimously that although she had not committed any crimes, her relationship with the Communists represented a "bad tendency" and thus was unprotected. The "bad tendency" test was finally overturned in ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' (1969) and was replaced by the "[[imminent lawless action]]" test.

'''Robert C. "Bob" Mants, Jr.''' (April 25, 1943 – December 7, 2011) was an American civil rights activist, serving as a field secretary for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). He helped lead [[Selma to Montgomery marches|the voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery]]; he was standing in the second rank (with [[Albert Turner (civil rights activist)|Albert Turner]], behind [[Hosea Williams]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]]) on [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]]. After Selma, Mants moved to [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes County]], working for civil rights for the remainder of his life. Lowndes County contained the majority of the distance covered by the Selma to Montgomery march, and was then notorious for its racist violence.

==Early life==
Mants was born in [[East Point, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=Legacy /&gt; He graduated in 1961 from East Point/South Fulton High School,&lt;ref name=Legacy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sncclegacyproject.org/robert-c-mants-jr |title=Robert "Bob" Mants (1943–2011) |author=Kranz, Sharlene |date=7 December 2011 |publisher=SNCC Legacy Project |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a segregated black high school. While he was attending high school, Mants was a member of the [[Committee on Appeal for Human Rights]] (which would later develop into the [[Atlanta Student Movement]]) and volunteering for administrative tasks at the headquarters of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee,&lt;ref name=Legacy /&gt; two blocks from his home.&lt;ref name=SNCC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://snccdigital.org/people/bob-mants/ |title=Bob Mants: April 25, 1943–December 7, 2011; Raised in Atlanta, Georgia |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012 |website=SNCC Digital |publisher=Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would go on to attend [[Morehouse College]] with the intention of majoring in medicine,&lt;ref name=SNCC /&gt; but left without graduating, working in 1964 with SNCC in [[Americus, Georgia]]. Afterwards, he would move on to Lowndes County in early 1965.&lt;ref name=Legacy /&gt;

While in Americus, Mants reported over the [[Wide Area Telephone Service]] that "negro and white" mobs were forming on the evening of July 6, 1964, possibly in response to riots the evening before or the integration of two downtown restaurants earlier in the day, which had occurred without incident. Mants was working to calm and disperse the mobs. An hour later, Mants reported a drive-by shooting with no reported injuries or deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://cdm15932.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15932coll2/id/24020 |title=King—July, 1964 WATS Line Calls |author=King, Mary E. |date=1962–1999 |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society: Freedom Summer Collection |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mants and [[Stokely Carmichael]] from the SNCC first arrived in Selma to participate in the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march;&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt; in photographs of Bloody Sunday taken by [[Spider Martin]], Mants can be seen wearing a patterned cap, marching next to Albert Turner just behind John Lewis after crossing the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spidermartin.com/image-gallery/x3g93wop9oi0brr0tjwp54kfsoas96 |title=1/5 'Selma 1965 Bloody Sunday': Hosea Williams and John Lewis leading marchers over the Alabama River |author=Martin, Spider |date=7 March 1965 |publisher=Spider Martin |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spidermartin.com/image-gallery/rxtx0c3nbgkjd4gn6gkdr6uzxvel9h |title=1/7 'Two Minute Warning': Hosea Williams and John Lewis confront troopers on Bloody Sunday |author=Martin, Spider |date=7 March 1965 |publisher=Spider Martin |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; earlier that morning, Mants had participated in a prayer at the [[Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church (Selma, Alabama)|Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church]], where the march originated, with John Lewis, Hosea Williams, and [[Andrew Young]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stevenkasher.com/exhibitions/selma-march-1965?view=slider#2 |title=Bob Mants, John Lewis, Hosea Williams and Andrew Young with Brown's Chapel AME Church in the Background |author=Martin, Spider |date=7 March 1965 |publisher=Steven Kasher Gallery |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the violent suppression on Bloody Sunday, Mants saved a woman from a possible beating and took her away from the tear gas cloud.&lt;ref name=AlBenn /&gt;

While marching to Montgomery in late March 1965, Mants was passing out buttons and leaflets when a resident of Lowndes County, pleased the civil rights movement was coming to her, memorably quoted [[Revelation 7]]:9 to him.&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt; In 1964, Lowndes County had no registered black voters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/14/us/ex-black-militant-gets-life-for-murdering-deputy.html |title=Ex-Black Militant Gets Life for Murdering Deputy |author=Firestone, David |date=14 March 2002 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the county's population was predominantly black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/05/us/a-selma-march-relives-those-first-steps-of-65.html |title=A Selma March Relives Those First Steps of '65 |author=Smothers, Ronald |date=5 March 1990 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=21 February 2017 |quote=Two months after Bloody Sunday, Robert Mants said as he marched today, an organization he was in got to work in nearby Lowndes County, which was 81 percent black and had fewer than 30 black registered voters and no black elected officials.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The county was known as "Bloody Lowndes" or the rusty buckle of the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt of Alabama]] because of its long, violent history of whites retaliating against blacks who tried to register to vote.&lt;ref name=BloodyLowndes&gt;{{cite book |url=https://nyupress.org/books/9780814743317/ |title=Bloody Lowndes: Civil Rights and Black Power in Alabama's Black Belt |author=Jeffries, Hasan Kwame |date=August 2010 |isbn=978-0-81474-331-7 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York, New York |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{cite interview |subject=Bob Mants |interviewer=Carroll Blue |date=18 October 1988 |publisher=Washington University Libraries, Film and Media Archive, Henry Hampton Collection |accessdate=21 February 2017 |title=Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads 1965 to 1985 |url=http://digital.wustl.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=eop;cc=eop;rgn=main;view=text;idno=man5427.0175.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mants and other SNCC officials began to register black voters,&lt;ref name=AlBenn /&gt; the newly registered voters, many of which still lived on plantations, were made homeless by the predominantly white landowners.&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt; Many of the displaced black residents were housed in a temporary "Tent City" and subject to intimidation over the next two years as shots were regularly fired into the encampment.&lt;ref name=SNCC /&gt; In response, SNCC set up the [[Alabama Poor People's Land Fund]] to purchase plots of land and building materials to help the displaced black residents to build new homes.&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt;

SNCC also tried a new strategy in Lowndes County, setting up the [[Lowndes County Freedom Organization]] (LCFO) in 1966 as an independent Black political party, adopting a snarling black panther as its logo. LCFO would in turn inspire other leaders, such as Stokely Carmichael, who adopted the structure of LCFO for [[Black Power]], and [[Bobby Seale]] and [[Huey P. Newton]], who adopted the black panther logo for the [[Black Panther Party]].&lt;ref name=BloodyLowndes /&gt;

Mants remained in Lowndes County after the march, saying "if there was any place I wanted to raise my kids, it would be here, because they could see black people moving forward, advancing ourselves as a race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/02/us/in-selma-everything-and-nothing-changed.html?pagewanted=all |title=In Selma, Everything and Nothing Changed |author=Applebome, Peter |date=2 August 1994 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mants served as a farm management specialist at [[Tuskegee University]].&lt;ref name=AlBenn /&gt; In 1984, Mants was elected to the Lowndes County Commission, unseating a white incumbent, and served one term.&lt;ref name=SNCC /&gt;&lt;ref name=AlBenn /&gt;

In 2000, Mants opposed the creation of a landfill along [[U.S. Route 80]], the highway taken by marchers in the third Selma to Montgomery march, calling it "an insult." As head of Lowndes County Friends of the Trail, he noted "you can't commemorate [the route of the march] on the one hand and desecrate it on the other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/02/us/at-odds-in-alabama-over-a-landfill-on-a-historic-trail.html |title=At Odds in Alabama Over a Landfill on a Historic Trail |author=Sengupta, Somini |date=2 October 2000 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, '''bootstrapping''' usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to proceed without external input.  In [[computer technology]] the term (usually shortened to '''booting''') usually refers to the process of loading the basic software into the memory of a computer after power-on or general reset, especially the [[operating system]] which will then take care of loading other software as needed.

The term appears to have originated in the early 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century United States (particularly in the phrase "pull oneself over a fence by one's bootstraps") to mean an absurdly impossible action, an [[adynaton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-boo2.htm World Wide Words: Boot], Michael Quinion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="linguist-listserv"&gt;{{cite mailing list | url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2005-August/053187.html | title=bootstraps--speculation/questions | date=2005-08-28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129230419/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0508D&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=14748 | archive-date=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="examples"&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2005-August/052756.html |title=figurative 'bootstraps' |date=2005-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[Image:Dr Martens, black, old.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of boots with one bootstrap visible]]
Tall [[boot]]s may have a tab, loop or handle at the top known as a bootstrap, allowing one to use fingers or a [[Boot jack|boot hook]] tool to help pulling the boots on. The [[saying]] "to {{linktext|pull oneself up by one's bootstraps}}"&lt;ref name="examples"/&gt; was already in use during the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century as an example of an impossible task.  The [[idiom]] dates at least to 1834, when it appeared in the ''Workingman's Advocate'': "It is conjectured that Mr. Murphee will now be enabled to hand himself over the Cumberland river or a barn yard fence by the straps of his boots."&lt;ref name=Freeman1&gt;Jan Freeman, [http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/theword/2009/01/bootstraps_and.html Bootstraps and Baron Munchausen], ''[[Boston.com]]'', January 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 it appeared in a comment on [[philosophy of mind]]: "The attempt of the mind to analyze itself [is] an effort analogous to one who would lift himself by his own bootstraps."&lt;ref&gt;Jan Freeman, [http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/01/25/the_unkindliest_cut/ The unkindliest cut], ''[[Boston.com]]'', January 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Bootstrap as a metaphor, meaning to better oneself by one's own unaided efforts, was in use in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' cited in the Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; This metaphor spawned additional metaphors for a series of self-sustaining processes that proceed without external help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/290800.html|title='Pull yourself up by your bootstraps' - the meaning and origin of this phrase|first=Gary|last=Martin|website=Phrasefinder|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zentralbibliothek Solothurn - Münchhausen zieht sich am Zopf aus dem Sumpf - a0400.tif|right|thumb|[[Baron Munchausen]] pulls himself and his horse out of a swamp by his pigtail]]

The term is sometimes attributed to a story in [[Rudolf Erich Raspe]]'s ''[[wikisource:The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen|The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'', but in that story [[Baron Munchausen]] pulls himself (and his horse) out of a swamp by his hair (specifically, his pigtail), not by his bootstraps{{snd}} and no explicit reference to bootstraps has been found elsewhere in the various versions of the Munchausen tales.&lt;ref name="Freeman1" /&gt;

==Applications==

===Computing===

====Software loading and execution====
{{main article | Booting | Reboot (computing)}}
'''Booting''' is the process of starting a computer, specifically with regard to starting its software.  The process involves a chain of stages, in which at each stage a smaller, simpler program loads and then executes the larger, more complicated program of the next stage.  It is in this sense that the computer "pulls itself up by its bootstraps", ''i.e.'' it improves itself by its own efforts. Booting is a chain of events that starts with execution of hardware-based procedures and may then hand-off to [[firmware]] and software which is loaded into [[main memory]]. Booting often involves processes such as performing [[power-on self-test|self-tests]], loading [[computer configuration|configuration]] settings, loading a [[BIOS]], [[resident monitor]]s, a [[hypervisor]], an [[operating system]], or [[utility software]].

The computer term bootstrap began as a metaphor in the 1950s. In computers, pressing a bootstrap button caused a [[hardwired control|hardwired program]] to read a bootstrap program from an input unit. The computer would then execute the bootstrap program, which caused it to read more program instructions. It became a self-sustaining process that proceeded without external help from manually entered instructions. As a computing term, bootstrap has been used since at least 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 1953 | title = The System Design of the IBM Type 701 Computer | author = Buchholz, Werner | journal = Proceedings of the I.R.E. | volume = 41 | issue = 10 | page = 1273 | doi=10.1109/jrproc.1953.274300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Software development====
Bootstrapping can also refer to the development of successively more complex, faster programming environments. The simplest environment will be, perhaps, a very basic text editor (''e.g.'', [[ed (UNIX)|ed]]) and an [[Assembly language#Assembler|assembler]] program. Using these tools, one can write a more complex text editor, and a simple compiler for a higher-level language and so on, until one can have a [[graphical user interface|graphical]] [[integrated development environment|IDE]] and an extremely [[high-level programming language]].

Historically, bootstrapping also refers to an early technique for computer program development on new hardware. The technique described in this paragraph has been replaced by the use of a [[cross compiler]] executed by a pre-existing computer.  Bootstrapping in program development began during the 1950s when each program was constructed on paper in decimal code or in binary code, bit by bit (1s and 0s), because there was no high-level computer language, no [[compiler]], no assembler, and no [[Linker (computing)|linker]]. A tiny assembler program was hand-coded for a new computer (for example the [[IBM 650]]) which converted a few instructions into binary or decimal code: A1. This simple assembler program was then rewritten in its just-defined [[assembly language]] but with extensions that would enable the use of some additional mnemonics for more complex operation codes. The enhanced assembler's source program was then assembled by its predecessor's executable (A1) into binary or decimal code to give A2, and the cycle repeated (now with those enhancements available), until the entire instruction set was coded, branch addresses were automatically calculated, and other conveniences (such as conditional assembly, macros, optimisations, etc.) established.  This was how the early assembly program SOAP ([[Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program]]) was developed.  Compilers, linkers, loaders, and utilities were then coded in assembly language, further continuing the bootstrapping process of developing complex software systems by using simpler software.

The term was also championed by [[Doug Engelbart]] to refer to his belief that organizations could better evolve by improving the process they use for improvement (thus obtaining a compounding effect over time). His [[SRI International|SRI]] team that developed the [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]] hypertext system applied this strategy by using the tool they had developed to improve the tool.

====Compilers====
{{main article | Bootstrapping (compilers)}}
The development of compilers for new programming languages first developed in an existing language but then rewritten in the new language and compiled by itself, is another example of the bootstrapping notion. Using an existing language to bootstrap a new language is one way to solve the "[[chicken or the egg]]" causality dilemma.

====Installers====
{{main article | Installation (computer programs)}}
During the installation of computer programs it is sometimes necessary to update the installer or package manager itself. The common pattern for this is to use a small executable bootstrapper file (''e.g.'' [[setup.exe]]) which updates the installer and starts the real installation after the update. Sometimes the bootstrapper also installs other prerequisites for the software during the bootstrapping process.

====Overlay networks====
{{main article|Bootstrapping node}}

A bootstrapping node, also known as a rendezvous host,&lt;ref name="Francis01"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Yoid: Extending the Internet Multicast Architecture |publisher=www.aciri.org |author=Francis, Paul |date=2000-04-02 |url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/francis/yoidArch.pdf |accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Node (networking)|node]] in an [[overlay network]] that provides initial configuration information to newly joining nodes so that they may successfully join the overlay network.&lt;ref name="sun01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=6cF3AAAAEBAJ |title=US Patent 7,065,579 |accessdate=2008-12-23 |author=Traversat |date=2006-06-20 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saxena01"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Admission Control in Peer-to-Peer: Design and Performance Evaluation |publisher=In ACM Workshop on Security of Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks (SASN) 2003 |author=Saxena |year=2003 |url=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~gts/paps/sty03.pdf |accessdate=2008-12-24 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Discrete event simulation====
{{main article | Discrete event simulation}}
A type of [[computer simulation]] called [[discrete event simulation]] represents the operation of a system as a chronological sequence of events. A technique called ''bootstrapping the simulation model'' is used, which bootstraps initial data points using a [[pseudorandom number generator]] to schedule an initial set of pending events, which schedule additional events, and with time, the distribution of event times approaches its [[steady state]]—the bootstrapping behavior is overwhelmed by steady-state behavior.

====Artificial intelligence and machine learning====
{{main article | Bootstrap aggregating | Intelligence explosion}}
Bootstrapping is a technique used to iteratively improve a [[classifier (machine learning)|classifier]]'s performance. Seed AI is a hypothesized type of [[artificial intelligence]] capable of [[Intelligence explosion|recursive self-improvement]]. Having improved itself, it would become better at improving itself, potentially leading to an exponential increase in intelligence. No such AI is known to exist, but it remains an active field of research.

Seed AI is a significant part of some theories about the [[technological singularity]]: proponents believe that the development of seed AI will rapidly yield ever-smarter intelligence (via bootstrapping) and thus a new era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cortese|first=Francesco Albert Bosco|date=Spring 2014|title=The Maximally Distributed Intelligence Explosion|url=https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS14/paper/viewFile/7763/7739|journal=AAAI Spring Symposium|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waser|first=Mark R.|date=2014|title=Bootstrapping a Structured Self-Improving &amp; Safe Autopoietic Self|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877050914015403/1-s2.0-S1877050914015403-main.pdf?_tid=eba4f73c-b275-435a-aa44-363f7e8c83bb&amp;acdnat=1530480295_5671d8d4b0fcd9317c8900ff77997992|journal=Procedia Computer Science|volume=Volume 41|pages=134-139|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics===
{{main article | Bootstrapping (statistics) | Bootstrapping populations}}
Bootstrapping is a [[resampling (statistics)|resampling]] technique used to obtain estimates of summary statistics.

[[Richard Dawkins]] in his book ''River Out of Eden''&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins, ''River Out of Eden'', pages 23-25, 1995 (paper) {{ISBN|0-465-06990-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the computer bootstrapping concept to explain how biological cells differentiate: "Different cells receive different combinations of chemicals, which switch on different combinations of genes, and some genes work to switch other genes on or off. And so the bootstrapping continues, until we have the full repertoire of different kinds of cells."

Bootstrapping is using very general consistency criteria to determine the form of a quantum theory from some assumptions on the spectrum of particles or operators.

==== Magnetically confined fusion plasmas ====
In [[tokamak]] fusion devices, bootstrapping refers to the process in which a [[bootstrap current]] is self-generated by the plasma, which reduces or eliminates the need for an external current driver. Maximising the bootstrap current is a major goal of advanced tokamak designs.

==== Inertially confined fusion plasmas ====
Bootstrapping in [[inertial confinement fusion]] refers to the alpha particles produced in the fusion reaction providing further heating to the plasma. This heating leads to ignition and an overall energy gain.

===Electronics===
{{main article | Bootstrapping (electronics)}}
Bootstrapping is a form of positive feedback in analog circuit design.

=== Electric power grid ===
{{Main article|Black start}}

An electric power grid is almost never brought down intentionally. Generators and power stations are started and shut down as necessary. A typical power station requires power for start up prior to being able to generate power. This power is obtained from the grid, so if the entire grid is down these stations cannot be started.

Therefore, to get a grid started, there must be at least a small number of power stations that can start entirely on their own. A [[black start]] is the process of restoring a power station to operation without relying on external power. In the absence of grid power, one or more black starts are used to bootstrap the grid.

===Cellular networks===
{{main article | Bootstrapping Server Function | Generic Bootstrapping Architecture }}
A Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) is an intermediary element in [[cellular network]]s which provides application independent functions for mutual [[authentication]] of user equipment and servers unknown to each other and for 'bootstrapping' the exchange of secret session keys afterwards. The term 'bootstrapping' is related to building a security relation with a previously unknown device first and to allow installing security elements (keys) in the device and the BSF afterwards.

===Media===
{{Unreferenced section|date = December 2015|small = yes}}

A media bootstrap is the process whereby a story or meme is deliberately (but artificially) produced by self and peer-referential journalism, originally within a tight circle of media content originators, often commencing with stories written within the same media organization. This story is then expanded into a general media "accepted wisdom" with the aim of having it accepted as self-evident "common knowledge" by the reading, listening and viewing publics. The key feature of a media bootstrap is that as little hard, verifiable, external evidence as possible is used to support the story, preference being given to the citation (often unattributed) of other media stories, ''i.e.'' "journalists interviewing journalists".

Because the campaign is usually originated and at least initially concocted internally by a media organization with a particular agenda in mind, within a closed loop of reportage and opinionation, the campaign is said to have "pulled itself up by its own bootstraps".

A bootstrap campaign should be distinguished from a genuine news story of genuine interest, such as a natural disaster that kills thousands, or the death of a respected public figure. It is legitimate for these stories to be given coverage across all media platforms. What distinguishes a bootstrap from a real story is the contrived and organized manner in which the bootstrap appears to come out of nowhere. A bootstrap commonly claims to be tapping a hitherto unrecognized phenomenon within society.

As self-[[levitating]] by pulling on one's bootstraps is physically impossible, this is often used by the bootstrappers themselves to deny the possibility that the bootstrap campaign is indeed concocted and artificial. They assert that it has arisen via a groundswell of public opinion. Media campaigns that are openly admitted as concocted (''e.g.'' a public service campaign titled "Let's Clean Up Our City") are usually ignored by other media organizations for reasons related to competition. On the other hand, the true bootstrap welcomes the participation of other media organizations, indeed encourages it, as this participation gains the bootstrap notoriety and, most importantly, legitimacy.

{{see also|Covariance and contravariance of vectors}}
In [[physics]], a '''covariant transformation''' is a rule that specifies how certain entities, such as [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]s or [[tensor]]s, change under a [[change of basis]]. The transformation that describes the new [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis vectors]] as a linear combination of the old basis vectors is ''defined'' as a '''covariant transformation'''. Conventionally, indices identifying the basis vectors are placed as '''lower indices''' and so are all entities that transform in the same way. The inverse of a covariant transformation is a '''[[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] transformation'''. Whenever a vector should be ''invariant'' under a change of basis, that is to say it should represent the same geometrical or physical object having the same magnitude and direction as before, its ''components'' must transform according to the contravariant rule. Conventionally, indices identifying the components of a vector are placed as '''upper indices''' and so are all indices of entities that transform in the same way. The sum over pairwise matching indices of a product with the same lower and upper indices are [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under a transformation.

A vector itself is a geometrical quantity, in principle, independent (invariant) of the chosen basis. A vector '''v''' is given, say, in components ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; on a chosen basis '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. On another basis, say '''e'''′&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, the same vector '''v''' has different components ''v''′&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \sum_i v^i {\mathbf e}_i  = \sum_j {v'\,}^j \mathbf{e}'_j.&lt;/math&gt;
As a vector, '''v''' should be invariant to the chosen coordinate system and independent of any chosen basis, i.e. its "real world" direction and magnitude should appear the same regardless of the basis vectors. If we perform a change of basis by transforming the vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; into the basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, we must also ensure that the components ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; transform into the new components ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; to compensate.

The needed transformation of '''v''' is called the '''contravariant transformation''' rule.

&lt;div style="float:left; border:1px solid #aaa; padding:3px; margin-right:1em; text-align:left"&gt;

  Image:Transformation2polar_basis_vectors.svg|A vector '''v''', and local tangent basis vectors {{nowrap|{'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;} }} and {{nowrap|{'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;} }}.
  &lt;!-- Image:Transformation2polar.svg|Components (''v''&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;,''v''&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;) and (''v''&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;,''v''&lt;sup&gt;φ&lt;/sup&gt;) of '''v'''. --&gt;
  Image:Transformation2polar contravariant vector.svg|Coordinate representations of '''v'''.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
In the shown example, a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \sum_{i \in \{x,y\} } v^i {\mathbf e}_i  = \sum_{j \in \{r,\phi\}} {v'\,}^j \mathbf{e}'_j.&lt;/math&gt; is described by two different coordinate systems: a rectangular coordinate system (the black grid), and a radial coordinate system (the red grid).  Basis vectors have been chosen for both coordinate systems: '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; for the rectangular coordinate system, and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt; for the radial coordinate system. The radial basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt; appear rotated anticlockwise with respect to the rectangular basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;. The '''covariant transformation,''' performed to the basis vectors, is thus an anticlockwise rotation, rotating from the first basis vectors to the second basis vectors.

The coordinates of '''v''' must be transformed into the new coordinate system, but the vector '''v''' itself, as a mathematical object, remains independent of the basis chosen, appearing to point in the same direction and with the same magnitude, invariant to the change of coordinates. The contravariant transformation ensures this, by compensating for the rotation between the different bases. If we view '''v''' from the context of the radial coordinate system, it appears to be rotated more clockwise from the basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;. compared to how it appeared relative to the rectangular basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, the needed contravariant transformation to '''v''' in this example is a clockwise rotation.{{clear}}

==Examples of covariant transformation==
===The derivative of a function transforms covariantly===
The explicit form of a covariant transformation is best introduced with the transformation properties of the derivative of a function.  Consider a scalar function ''f'' (like the temperature at a location in a space) defined on a set of points ''p'', identifiable in a given coordinate system &lt;math&gt;x^i,\; i=0,1,\dots&lt;/math&gt; (such a collection is called a [[manifold]]).  If we adopt a new coordinates system &lt;math&gt;{x'}^j, j=0,1,\dots&lt;/math&gt; then for each ''i'', the original coordinate &lt;math&gt;{x}^i&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a function of the new coordinates, so &lt;math&gt;x^i \left({x'}^j\right), j=0,1,\dots&lt;/math&gt; One can express the derivative of ''f'' in new coordinates in terms of the old coordinates, using the [[chain rule]] of the derivative, as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial {x}^i} =
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial {x'}^j} \;
    \frac{\partial {x'}^j}{\partial {x}^i}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the explicit form of the '''covariant transformation''' rule. The notation of a normal derivative with respect to the coordinates sometimes uses a comma, as follows
:&lt;math&gt;f_{,i} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}&lt;/math&gt;
where the index ''i'' is placed as a lower index, because of the covariant transformation.

===Basis vectors transform covariantly===
A vector can be expressed in terms of basis vectors. For a certain coordinate system, we can choose the vectors tangent to the coordinate grid. This basis is called the coordinate basis.

To illustrate the transformation properties, consider again the set of points ''p'', identifiable in a given coordinate system &lt;math&gt;x^i&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;i = 0, 1, \dots&lt;/math&gt; ([[manifold]]). A scalar function ''f'', that assigns a real number to every point ''p'' in this space, is a function of the coordinates &lt;math&gt;f\;\left(x^0, x^1, \dots\right)&lt;/math&gt;. A curve is a one-parameter collection of points ''c'', say with curve parameter λ, ''c''(λ). A tangent vector '''v''' to the curve is the derivative &lt;math&gt;dc/d\lambda&lt;/math&gt; along the curve with the derivative taken at the point ''p'' under consideration. Note that we can see the '''[[tangent vector]] v''' as an '''operator''' (the '''[[directional derivative]]''') which can be applied to a function
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}[f] \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{df}{d\lambda} = \frac{d\;\;}{d\lambda} f(c(\lambda))&lt;/math&gt;

The parallel between the tangent vector and the operator can also be worked out in coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}[f] = \frac{dx^i}{d\lambda} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}&lt;/math&gt;

or in terms of operators &lt;math&gt;\partial/\partial x^i&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \frac{dx^i}{d\lambda} \frac{\partial \;\;}{\partial x^i} = \frac{dx^i}{d\lambda} \mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt;
where we have written &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i = \partial/\partial x^i&lt;/math&gt;, the tangent vectors to the curves which are simply the coordinate grid itself.

If we adopt a new coordinates system &lt;math&gt;{x'}^i, \;i=0,1,\dots&lt;/math&gt; then for each ''i'', the old coordinate &lt;math&gt;{x^i}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as function of the new system, so &lt;math&gt;x^i\left({x'}^j\right), j=0,1,\dots&lt;/math&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}'_i = {\partial}/{\partial {x'}^i}&lt;/math&gt; be the basis, tangent vectors in this new coordinates system. We can express &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; in the new system by applying the [[chain rule]] on ''x''. As a function of coordinates we find the following transformation
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{e}'_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial {x'}^i} =
                  \frac{\partial x^j}{\partial {x'}^i}
                    \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} =
                  \frac{\partial x^j}{\partial {x'}^i} 
                    \mathbf{e}_j
&lt;/math&gt;
which indeed is the same as the covariant transformation for the derivative of a function.

==Contravariant transformation==

The ''components'' of a (tangent) vector transform in a different way, called contravariant transformation.  Consider a tangent vector '''v''' and call its components &lt;math&gt;v^i&lt;/math&gt; on a basis &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt;.  On another basis &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}'_i&lt;/math&gt; we call the components &lt;math&gt;{v'}^i &lt;/math&gt;, so
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} =  v^i \mathbf{e}_i  = {v'}^i  \mathbf{e}'_i&lt;/math&gt;
in which 
:&lt;math&gt;
     v^i = \frac{dx^i}{d\lambda} \;\mbox{ and }\;
  {v'}^i = \frac{d{x'}^i}{d\lambda}    
&lt;/math&gt;

If we express the new components in terms of the old ones, then
:&lt;math&gt; 
  {v'}^i = \frac{d{x'}^i}{d\lambda\;\;} =
             \frac{\partial {x'}^i}{\partial x^j}
           \frac{dx^j}{d\lambda} =
             \frac{\partial {x'}^i}{\partial x^j} {v}^j
&lt;/math&gt;
This is the explicit form of a transformation called the '''contravariant transformation''' and we note that it is different and just the inverse of the covariant rule. In order to distinguish them from the covariant (tangent) vectors, the index is placed on top.

===Differential forms transform contravariantly===

An example of a contravariant transformation is given by a [[differential form]] ''df''.  For ''f'' as a function of coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^i&lt;/math&gt;, ''df'' can be expressed in terms of &lt;math&gt; dx^i&lt;/math&gt;.  The differentials ''dx''  transform according to the contravariant rule since
:&lt;math&gt;d{x'}^i = \frac{\partial {x'}^i}{\partial {x}^j} {dx}^j&lt;/math&gt;

==Dual properties==

Entities that transform covariantly (like basis vectors) and the ones that transform contravariantly (like components of a vector and differential forms) are "almost the same" and yet they are different. They have "dual" properties.
What is behind this, is mathematically known as the [[dual space]] that always goes together with a given linear [[vector space]].

Take any vector space T. A function ''f'' on T is called linear if, for any vectors '''v''', '''w''' and scalar α:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  f(\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) &amp;= f(\mathbf{v}) + f(\mathbf{w}) \\
        f(\alpha \mathbf{v}) &amp;= \alpha f(\mathbf{v})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A simple example is the function which assigns a vector the value of one of its components (called a ''projection function''). It has a vector as argument and assigns a real number, the value of a component.

All such ''scalar-valued'' linear functions together form a vector space, called the '''dual space''' of T. The sum ''f+g'' is again a linear function for linear ''f''  and ''g'', and the same holds for scalar multiplication α''f''.

Given a basis &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; for T, we can define a basis, called the '''dual basis''' for the dual space in a natural way by taking the set of linear functions mentioned above: the projection functions.  Each projection function (indexed by ω) produces the number 1 when applied to one of the basis vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\omega^0&lt;/math&gt; gives a 1 on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_0&lt;/math&gt; and zero elsewhere.  Applying this linear function &lt;math&gt;{\omega}^0&lt;/math&gt; to a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} =v^i \mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt;, gives (using its linearity)
:&lt;math&gt;
  \omega^0(\mathbf{v}) = \omega^0(v^i \mathbf{e}_i) = 
    v^i \omega^0(\mathbf{e}_i) = v^0
&lt;/math&gt;
so just the value of the first coordinate. For this reason it is called the '''projection function'''.

There are as many dual basis vectors &lt;math&gt;\omega^i&lt;/math&gt; as there are basis vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt;, so the dual space has the same dimension as the linear space itself. It is "almost the same space", except that the elements of the dual space (called '''dual vectors''') transform covariantly and the elements of the tangent vector space transform contravariantly.

Sometimes an extra notation is introduced where the real value of a linear function σ on a tangent vector '''u''' is given as
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma [\mathbf{u}] :=  \langle \sigma, \mathbf{u}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\langle\sigma, \mathbf{u}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a real number. This notation emphasizes the bilinear character of the form. It is linear in σ since that is a linear function and it is linear in '''u''' since that is an element of a vector space.

==Co- and contravariant tensor components==
===Without coordinates===
A [[tensor]] of [[type of a tensor|type (''r'', ''s'')]] may be defined as a real-valued multilinear function of ''r'' dual vectors and ''s'' vectors. Since vectors and dual vectors may be defined without dependence on a coordinate system, a tensor defined in this way is independent of the choice of a coordinate system.

The notation of a tensor is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
            &amp;T\left(\sigma, \ldots ,\rho, \mathbf{u}, \ldots, \mathbf{v}\right) \\
  \equiv {} &amp;{T^{\sigma \ldots \rho}}_{\mathbf{u} \ldots \mathbf{v}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
for dual vectors (differential forms) ''ρ'', ''σ'' and tangent vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;. In the second notation the distinction between vectors and  differential forms is more obvious.

===With coordinates===

Because a tensor depends linearly on its arguments, it is completely determined if one knows the values on a basis &lt;math&gt;\omega^i \ldots \omega^j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_k \ldots \mathbf{e}_l&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  T(\omega^i,\ldots,\omega^j, \mathbf{e}_k \ldots \mathbf{e}_l) =
    {T^{i\ldots j}}_{k\ldots l}
&lt;/math&gt;
The numbers &lt;math&gt;{T^{i\ldots j}}_{k\ldots l}&lt;/math&gt; are called the '''components of the tensor on the chosen basis'''.

If we choose another basis (which are a linear combination of the original basis), we can use the linear properties of the tensor and we will find that the tensor components in the upper indices transform as dual vectors (so contravariant), whereas the lower indices will transform as the basis of tangent vectors and are thus covariant. For a tensor of rank 2, we can verify that
:&lt;math&gt; 
     {A'}_{i j} = \frac{\partial x^l}{\partial {x'}^i}
                       \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial {x'}^j} A_{l m}
&lt;/math&gt; '''covariant tensor'''
:&lt;math&gt;  
     {A'\,}^{i j} = \frac{\partial {x'}^i}{\partial x^l}
                 \frac{\partial {x'}^j}{\partial x^m} A^{l m}
&lt;/math&gt; '''contravariant tensor'''

For a mixed co- and contravariant tensor of rank 2
:&lt;math&gt;
     {A'\,}^i{}_j= \frac {\partial {x'}^i} {\partial x^l}
                 \frac {\partial x^m}      {\partial {x'}^j} A^l{}_m
&lt;/math&gt; '''mixed co- and contravariant tensor'''

'''DPSIR''' (drivers, pressures, state, impact and response model of intervention) is a causal framework for describing the interactions between society and the environment: [[Human impact on the environment]] and vice versa because of the [[interdependence]] of the components.

== Description ==

This framework has been adopted by the [[European Environment Agency]]. The components of this model are:
* '''D'''riving forces: e.g. [[industry]], [[tourism]], [[economic growth]]
* '''P'''ressures: e.g. [[pollution]], [[land-use change]], [[population growth]]
* '''S'''tates : e.g. [[water quality]], [[soil quality]], [[air quality]], [[habitat]], [[vegetation]]
* '''I'''mpacts : e.g. ill [[public health]], [[habitat fragmentation]], [[economic crisis]], [[environmental damage]], [[biodiversity loss]]
* '''R'''esponses : e.g. [[tax]]es, [[environmental law]]s, 

This framework is an extension of the pressure-state-response model developed by [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As a first step, data and information on all the different elements in the DPSIR chain is collected. Then possible connections between these different aspects are postulated. Through the use of the DPSIR modelling framework, it is possible to gauge the effectiveness of responses put into place.

({{Lang-en| Green Sprout}}), is the name of a geopolitical project by [[Lithuania]]n thinker [[Kazys Pakštas]] to create a Lithuanian colony in a geopolitically safe area. This semi-independent state was thought to serve as a safe haven for Lithuanians if the [[Republic of Lithuania]] would be occupied. In 1924 Kazys Pakštas considered [[Quebec]] to be the best location for such a colony. Later his attention switched to the [[state of São Paulo]] ([[Brasil]]) (1927), [[Angola]] (1930) and [[Madagascar]]. Efforts to establish a Lithuanian colony in [[Venezuela]] were abandoned due to the unstable political situation there. So finally it was decided to establish the Lithuanian colony in [[British Honduras]]. Meetings to set a land purchase or lease deal with local authorities in British Honduras were held. But due to the rise of an independence movement in British Honduras this project was not realised. The last considered location for Dausuva were the [[Bahamas]], but support for this project was getting weaker and it never came close to realisation.

'''Day-care sex-abuse hysteria''' was a [[moral panic]] that occurred primarily in the 1980s and early 1990s featuring charges against [[day care|day-care]] providers of several forms of [[child abuse]], including [[Satanic ritual abuse]].&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=L |last=Miller |authorlink= |title=Parole Board recommends Amirault's commutation |url=http://www.truthinjustice.org/amirault.htm |quote=The Amiraults always insisted they were innocent, the victims of a sex-abuse hysteria that swept the country in the 1980s and questionable testimony from child witnesses. |agency=Associated Press |date=2001-07-06 |accessdate=2007-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104063907/http://truthinjustice.org/amirault.htm |archivedate=2007-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent case in [[Kern County, California]] first brought the issue of day-care sexual abuse to the forefront of the public awareness, and the issue figured prominently in news coverage for almost a decade. The Kern County case was followed by cases elsewhere in the United States as well as Canada, New Zealand, Brazil, and various European countries.

==Causes==

===Anxiety===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, more and more mothers were working outside of the home, resulting in the opening of large numbers of day-care centers. Anxiety and guilt over leaving young children with strangers may have created a climate of fear and readiness to believe false accusations.&lt;ref name=Peggy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pendergrast |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Pendergrast |title=Victims of Memory: Sex Abuse Accusations and Shattered Lives |publisher= |quote='It seems [the day-care sex- abuse hysteria] had something to do with this fear that we'd turned our kids over to total strangers,' sociologist Catherine Beckett says ... |isbn=978-0-942679-18-2|year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suggestions and false allegations when interviewing children===
{{synthesis|section|talksection=Synthesis in discussion of causes|date=November 2016}}

Children are vulnerable to outside influences that lead to fabrication of testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carter |first=Sherrie Bourg |title=Children in the Courtroom |year=2005 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their testimony can be influenced in a variety of ways.
Maggie Bruck in her article published by the [[American Psychological Association]] wrote that children incorporate aspects of the interviewer's questions into their answers in an attempt to tell the interviewer what the child believes is being sought.&lt;ref name="ceci"&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies also show that when adults ask children questions that do not make sense (such as "is milk bigger than water?" or "is red heavier than yellow?"), most children will offer an answer, believing that there is an answer to be given, rather than understand the absurdity of the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McGough |first=Lucy S. |title=Child Witnesses: Fragile Voices in the American Legal System |year=1994 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, repeated questioning of children causes them to change their answers. This is because the children perceive the repeated questioning as a sign that they did not give the "correct" answer previously.&lt;ref name = "Ceci79"&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996|pp=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are also especially susceptible to leading and [[suggestive question]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that only a small percentage of children produce fictitious reports of sexual abuse on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D. P. H., and J. M. McGraw: Reliable and Fictitious Accounts of Sexual Abuse to Children. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 2, 27–45, 1987 {{doi|10.1177/088626087002001002}} [http://jiv.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/2/1/27]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oates, R. K., D.P. Jones, D. Denson, A.

Interviewer bias also plays a role in shaping child testimony. When an interviewer has a preconceived notion as to the truth of the matter being investigated, the questioning is conducted in a manner to extract statements that support these beliefs.&lt;ref name = "Ceci79"/&gt; As a result, evidence that could disprove the belief is never sought by the interviewer. Additionally, positive reinforcement by the interviewer can taint child testimony. Often such reinforcement is given to encourage a spirit of cooperation by the child, but the impartial tone can quickly disappear as the interviewer nods, smiles, or offers verbal encouragement to "helpful" statements.&lt;ref name = "Ceci79"/&gt; Some studies show that when interviewers make reassuring statements to child witnesses, the children are more likely to fabricate stories of past events that never occurred.&lt;ref name="ceci140"&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer pressure also influences children to fabricate stories. Studies show that when a child witness is told that his or her friends have already testified that certain events occurred, the child witness was more likely to create a matching story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996|pp=146–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of the interviewer can also influence a child's testimony, because the more authority an interviewer has such as a police officer, the more likely a child is to comply with that person's agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, while there are supporters of the use of [[anatomically correct doll]]s in questioning victims of sexual abuse/molestation, there are also critics of this practice.&lt;ref name ="Ceci162"&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics say that because of the novelty of the dolls, children will act out sexually explicit acts with the dolls even if the child has not been sexually abused.&lt;ref name ="Ceci162"/&gt; Another criticism is that because the studies that compare the differences between how abused and non-abused children play with these dolls are conflicting (some studies suggest that sexually abused children play with anatomically correct dolls in a more sexually explicit manner than non-abused children, while other studies suggest that there is no correlation), it is impossible to interpret what is meant by how a child plays with these dolls.&lt;ref name ="Ceci162"/&gt;

==Significant cases==

===McMartin Preschool===
{{Main|McMartin preschool trial}}

The McMartin Preschool case was the first daycare abuse case to receive major media attention in the United States.&lt;ref name="CAV"/&gt; The case centered upon the McMartin Preschool in [[Manhattan Beach, California]], where seven teachers were accused of kidnapping children, flying them in a plane to another location, and forcing them to engage in group sex as well as forcing them to watch [[Cruelty to animals|animals be tortured and killed]].&lt;ref name="CAV"/&gt; The case also involved accusations that children had been forced to participate in bizarre religious rituals, and been used to make child pornography.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; The case began with a single accusation, made by the mother - who was later found to be a paranoid schizophrenic&lt;ref name=Peggy&gt;{{cite news |first=Margaret |last=Talbot |authorlink= |title=The Lives They Lived: 01-07-01: Peggy McMartin Buckey, b. 1926; The Devil in The Nursery. |url=http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2001/the_devil_in_the_nursery |format=reprint from New America |quote=Buckey's ordeal began in 1983, when the mother of a 2½-year-old who attended the McMartin preschool in [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]], [[California]], called the police to report that her son had been sodomized there. It didn't matter that the woman was eventually found to be a paranoid schizophrenic, and that the accusations she made – of teachers who took children on airplane rides to Palm Springs and lured them into a labyrinth of underground tunnels where the accused "flew in the air" and others were "all dressed up as witches" ... |publisher=The New York Times |date=January 7, 2001 |accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; - of one of the students, but grew rapidly when investigators informed parents of the accusation and began interviewing other students.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; The case made headlines nationwide in 1984, and seven teachers were arrested and charged that year.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; When a new district attorney took over the case in 1986, however, his office re-examined the evidence and dropped charges against all but two of the original defendants. Their trials became one of the longest and most expensive criminal trials in the history of the United States,&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; but in 1990 all of these charges were also dropped.&lt;ref name="CAV"/&gt; Both jurors at the trial and academic researchers later criticized the interviewing techniques that investigators had used in their investigations of the school, alleging that interviewers had "coaxed" children into making unfounded accusations, repeatedly asking children the same questions and offering various incentives until the children reported having been abused.&lt;ref name="CAV"/&gt; Most scholars now agree that the accusations these interviews elicited from children were false.&lt;ref name="Schreiber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garven"/&gt; Sociologist [[Mary de Young]] and historian [[Philip Jenkins]] have both cited the McMartin case as the prototype for a wave of similar accusations and investigations between 1983 and 1995, which constituted a moral panic.&lt;ref name="de Young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

===Country Walk===
In 1985, Frank Fuster – the owner of the Country Walk Babysitting Service in the [[Country Walk, Florida|Country Walk]] suburb of [[Miami|Miami, Florida]] – was found guilty of 14 counts of abuse.&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; He was sentenced to prison with a minimum length of 165 years. Fuster's alleged victims testified that he led them in Satanic rituals and terrorized them by forcing them to watch him mutilate birds, a lesson to children who might reveal the abuse.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite news |last=Collins |first=Glen |title=Nightmare in Country Walk |publisher=The New York Times |date=1986-12-14 |quote=Mr. Fuster was convicted of molesting the children entrusted to his wife's care in their home in the middle-class Dade County suburb of Country Walk, a planned development that was intended to be an idyllic refuge from the anxieties of urban Miami. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/14/books/nightmare-in-country-walk.html?pagewanted=print |accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuster had been previously convicted for manslaughter and for molesting a 9-year-old child.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Testimony from children in the case was elicited by [[University of Miami]] [[child psychologist]]s Laurie and Joseph Braga, who resorted to coercive questioning of the alleged victims when the desired answers were not forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=De Young, Mary |authorlink=Mary de Young |title=The day care ritual abuse moral panic |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, N.C |year=2004 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_e8ZkJBtz0EC&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 71] |isbn=978-0-7864-1830-5 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuster's wife recanted her court testimony in an interview with Frontline, saying that she had been kept naked in solitary confinement and subjected to other forms of physical and psychological duress until she had agreed to testify against her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/fuster/etc/video.html|title=Did Daddy Do It|publisher=PBS|transcript=Transcript|transcript-url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/fuster/etc/script.html|date=April 25, 2002|series=Frontline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was prosecuted by Dade County state's attorney [[Janet Reno]].&lt;ref name=pbs2&gt;{{cite web |title=Was Fuster a Monster?: A Summary of the Frank Fuster "Country Walk" Case |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/fuster/frank/summary.html |work=Frontline |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2017, Fuster continues to serve a 165-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name=pbs2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=flyer&gt;{{cite web |title=Florida Department of Law Enforcement – Sexual Offender / Predator Flyer |url=http://offender.fdle.state.fl.us/offender/flyer.do?personId=58857 |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident also inspired a book and made-for-TV movie called ''Unspeakable Acts'' (1990).

===Fells Acres Day Care Center===
{{Main|Fells Acres Day Care Center preschool trial}}

In April 1984, [[Gerald Amirault]] was arrested and charged with abusing children in his care at the Fells Acres Day Care Center in [[Malden, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Beck2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Beck|title=We Believe the Children: A Moral Panic in the 1980s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x99-BAAAQBAJ|date=4 August 2015|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-61039-288-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nation"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/finality-or-justice/ |title='Finality' or Justice? |first=Katha |last=Pollitt |date=18 September 1999 |magazine=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Gerald changed the pants on a young boy who had wet himself, the boy's mother, uncle and therapist questioned him over a period of months, until the boy alleged that Gerald had been sexually abusing him. The boy's mother then called a child abuse hotline to report that her son had been sexually abused, and Gerald was arrested shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="Rabinowitz2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/30/us/day-care-workers-get-retrial-as-accusers-did-not-face-them.html |url-access=subscription |title=Day Care Workers Get Retrial, As Accusers Did Not Face Them |agency=The Associated Press |newspaper=The New York Times |date=30 August 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nation"/&gt; In the 1986 trial, Gerald was convicted of assaulting and raping nine children and sentenced to thirty to forty years in state prison. In a separate trial, his mother, Violet Amirault, and sister, Cheryl Amirault LeFave, were also convicted of similar charges and sentenced to jail for eight to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Day Care Workers Get Retrial, As Accusers Did Not Face Them. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/30/us/day-care-workers-get-retrial-as-accusers-did-not-face-them.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=August 30, 1995 |accessdate=2008-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richard Beck, the case developed "in the usual way" compared to other moral panic cases, with more and more children leveling increasingly bizarre allegations against the accused during the course of the investigation.&lt;ref name="Beck2015"/&gt; The allegations included reports of "bad clowns," robots, "magic rooms," and tortured animals.&lt;ref name="ATC"&gt;"Profile: Case of Gerald Amirault, a convicted child sex offender, and the prosecution of child sexual molestation cases." All Things Considered, April 19, 2000.

Previously, the boy's father had filed a complaint with ECDC objecting to Mr. Baran being allowed to work with children because he was a homosexual. On September 12th, 1984, the ECDC Board of Directors discussed Mr. Baran's sexuality and his possible termination. On October 5th, 1984, this family contacted the police to report that Mr. Baran had molested their child."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Video helps clear convict of abuse after 21 years." http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32341725/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/ Associated Press / MSNBC. 2009-08-09. His case had followed a tortured path – the first complaint came from a drug-addicted couple, acting as narcotics informants, who told their police connection they "didn't want no homo" watching their son.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days of the first allegation, ECDC hosted a puppet show and delivered letters to parents notifying them about a child at the day care with [[gonorrhea]]. Five other allegations emerged. Baran was tried in the Berkshire County courthouse 105 days after the first allegation, a swiftness noted in the later court rulings. The courtroom was closed during the children's testimony, which Baran claimed violated his right to a public trial. Baran's defense attorney was later ruled ineffective. Baran was convicted on January 30, 1985, on three counts of rape of a child and five counts of indecent assault and battery. He was sentenced to three life terms plus 8 to 20 years on each charge.

===Oak Hill satanic ritual abuse trial===
{{Main|Oak Hill satanic ritual abuse trial}}
Frances Keller and her husband, Dan Keller, both of [[Austin, Texas]], were convicted of sexually abusing a 3-year-old girl in their care, and they spent 21 years in prison until their release in 2013.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-texas-release-idUSBRE9AQ13R20131127|title=Texas frees daycare operator accused of 'satanic' sexual abuse|date=27 November 2013|publisher=|via=Reuters|newspaper=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case began on August 15, 1991, when a 3-year-old girl told her mother that Dan Keller had hurt her. The mother and daughter were on their way to a scheduled appointment with the girl’s therapist, who drew out details that included Keller defecating on her head and sexually assaulting her with a pen. During the time leading up to the trial, two other children from the day care offered similar accusations. According to the children, the couple served blood-laced Kool-Aid and forced them to have videotaped sex with adults and other children. The Kellers, they said, sometimes wore white robes and lit candles before hurting them. The children also accused the Kellers of forcing them to watch or participate in the killing and dismemberment of cats, dogs and a crying baby. Bodies were unearthed in cemeteries and new holes dug to hide freshly killed animals and, once, an adult passer-by was shot and dismembered with a chain saw. The children recalled several plane trips, including one to [[Mexico]], where they were sexually abused by soldiers before returning to [[Austin]] in time to meet their parents at the day care.&lt;ref name="case"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/fran-keller-to-be-freed-in-satanic-abuse-case/nb5S2/|title=Fran Keller to be freed in satanic abuse case|work=statesman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only physical evidence of abuse in the case was presented by Michael Mouw, an emergency room physician at Brackenridge Hospital who examined the 3-year-old girl in 1991 on the night she first accused Dan Keller of abuse. Mouw testified at the Kellers’ trial that he found two tears in the girl’s hymen consistent with sexual abuse and determined that the injuries were less than 24 hours old. Three years after the trial, while attending a medical seminar, Mouw said a slide presentation on “normal” pediatric hymens included a photo that was identical to what he had observed in the girl.&lt;ref name="case" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kvue.com/news/editors-pick/233691871.html Austin attorneys weigh in on why Kellers were convicted] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205081850/http://www.kvue.com/news/editors-pick/233691871.html |date=2013-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, 2013, the [[Travis County]] district attorney's office announced that Fran Keller, now 63, was being released on bond and her husband, Dan Keller, who was convicted at the same time, would be released within a week in a deal reached with lawyers.

===Christchurch Civic Crèche===
{{Main|Peter Ellis (childcare worker)}}
[[Peter Ellis (childcare worker)|Peter Ellis]], a child-care worker at the [[Christchurch]] Civic [[Day care|Crèche]] in [[New Zealand]], was found guilty on 16 counts of sexual abuse against children in 1992 and served seven years in jail. Parents of the alleged abuse victims were entitled to claim NZ$10,000 (equivalent to about US$11,000 in 2010) in compensation for each allegation from the [[Accident Compensation Corporation]], regardless of whether the allegations were proved or not. Many victims' families made multiple allegations. Four female co-workers were also arrested on 15 charges of abuse, but were released after these charges were dropped. Together with six other co-workers who lost their jobs when the centre was closed, they were awarded $1 million in compensation by the Employment Court in 1995, although this sum was reduced on appeal. Peter Ellis has consistently denied any abuse, and the case is still considered controversial by many New Zealanders.&lt;ref name="Power"&gt;{{cite news|title=Government to reconsider Peter Ellis case |publisher=The Press |date=15 December 2008 |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/thepress/4793550a6009.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113102452/http://www.stuff.co.nz/thepress/4793550a6009.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 January 2013 |accessdate=2009-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martensville satanic sex scandal===
{{Main|Martensville satanic sex scandal}}
In 1992, a mother in the central [[Saskatchewan]] city of [[Martensville]], alleged that a local woman who ran a babysitting service and day care center in her home had sexually abused her child. Police began an investigation, leading to a sharp increase in allegations. More than a dozen persons, including five police officers from two different forces, ultimately faced over 100 charges connected with running a Satanic cult called The Brotherhood of The Ram, which allegedly practiced ritualized sexual abuse of numerous children at a "Devil Church".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Satanic Sex Scandal |url=http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/martin/scandal.html |quote=The nightmare that descended on Martensville, Saskatchewan began when a local mother had some grave suspicions.

From California to Massachusetts to Florida, hundreds of young children reported being victimized by their teacher and daycare workers, often in orgies involving se rings or satanic cults."

* During the 1980s a series of highly publicized “daycare ritual abuse cases” erupted in communities across the United States and Europe. The cases typically involved allegations by preschool children that they had been terrorized and sexually abused by day-care workers in bizarre scenarios with Satanic or ritualistic overtones. Some scholars continue to take the view that these cases were genuine and involved actual ritual abuse (Faller, 1996; Summit, 1994). However, skepticism has become widespread among research psychologists. An extensive body of research, arising in the wake of the day-care cases of the 1980s, has identified a variety of interviewing techniques that can induce children to make false reports.
&lt;/ref&gt;

* "The McMartin affair was followed by dozens of comparable cases in all parts of the country, all involving bizarre or ritualistic methods of abuse and all sharing similar backgrounds.  Whether in Bakersfield (California), Jordan (Minnesota), Edenton, (North Carolina), Martensville (Canada) or Wenatchee (Washington), the affair generally began with a limited, plausible allegation... in the ensuing investigation, interrogation of child "victims" produced evidence that far more abuse had occurred than originally thought, and ultimately the compounding reports and rumors would implicate dozens of local residents in what could only be called sex rings or cults.  Supposed victims were questioned, until they confirmed the charges and offered their own creative embellishments."
* "Most day care and preschool prosecutions resulted in either the acquittal of the accused or the conviction of some individuals on counts that involved neither satanic nor ritualistic elements. Even these convictions were often overturned when appeals courts examined the means by which testimony had been elicited from children."

* "In the 1980s and early 1990s the United States witnessed an epidemic of what some commentators have called 'Satanic panic' ... contributing to the panic was a national outbreak of so-called 'daycare abuse' cases, in which groups of young children alleged that they had been sexually abused by their caretakers and forced to participate in bizarre ceremonies with satanic overtones.  Many social scientists, scholars, and legal authorities now view the stories of Satanic conspiracy that circulated in the 1980s as urban legends, and the daycare abuse cases as historical aberrations... Psychological researchers have taken a special interest in the interviewing techniques in these cases, which apparently induced children to make false accusations."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Face perception''' is an individual's understanding and interpretation of the [[face]], particularly the human face, especially in relation to the associated information processing in the [[brain]].

The proportions and expressions of the human face are important to identify origin, emotional tendencies, health qualities, and some social information. From birth, faces are important in the individual's social interaction. Face perceptions are very complex as the recognition of facial expressions involves extensive and diverse areas in the brain. Sometimes, damaged parts of the brain can cause specific impairments in understanding faces or [[prosopagnosia]].

==Development==
From [[birth]], infants possess rudimentary facial processing capacities and show heightened interest in faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morton|first=John|last2=Johnson|first2=Mark H.|title=CONSPEC and CONLERN: A two-process theory of infant face recognition.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.164|journal=Psychological Review|language=en|volume=98|issue=2|pages=164–181|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.98.2.164|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fantz|first=Robert L.|title=The Origin of Form Perception|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/scientificamerican0561-66|journal=Scientific American|volume=204|issue=5|pages=66–73|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0561-66|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, newborns (1-3 days) have been shown to be able to recognize faces even when they are rotated up to 45 degrees.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16513867|pmc=2773688|year=2006|author1=Onitsuka|first1=T|title=Functional and structural deficits in brain regions subserving face perception in schizophrenia|journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]|volume=163|issue=3|pages=455–62|last2=Niznikiewicz|first2=M.

Specifically, while newborns show a preference for faces, this behavior is reduced between one- to four months of age.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, D. (1985). Infants' Perception of Facedness. In T. M.

The perception of a positive or negative emotion on a face affects the way that an individual perceives and processes that face. For example, a face that is perceived to have a negative emotion is processed in a less holistic manner than a face displaying a positive emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curby|first=K.M.|author2=Johnson, K.J., &amp; Tyson A.|title=Face to face with emotion: Holistic face processing is modulated by emotional state|journal=Cognition and Emotion|year= 2012|volume= 26|issue= 1|pages= 93–102|doi= 10.1080/02699931.2011.555752|pmid= 21557121}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability of face recognition is apparent even in early childhood. The neurological mechanisms responsible for face recognition are present by age five. Research shows that the way children process faces is similar to that of adults, but adults process faces more efficiently. The reason for this may be because of advancements in memory and cognitive functioning that occur with age.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2011 799–815"/&gt;

Infants are able to comprehend facial expressions as [[social cues]] representing the feelings of other people before they are a year old. At seven months, the object of an observed face's apparent emotional reaction is relevant in processing the face. Infants at this age show greater negative central components to angry faces that are looking directly at them than elsewhere, although the direction of fearful faces' gaze produces no difference. In addition, two ERP components in the posterior part of the brain are differently aroused by the two negative expressions tested. These results indicate that infants at this age can at least partially understand the higher level of threat from [[anger]] directed at them as compared to anger directed elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Stefanie Hoehl &amp; Tricia Striano 2008 1752–1760" /&gt; By at least seven months of age, infants are also able to use facial expressions to understand others' behavior. Seven-month-olds will look to facial cues to understand the motives of other people in ambiguous situations, as shown by a study in which they watched an experimenter's face longer if she took a toy from them and maintained a neutral expression than if she made a happy expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[Tricia Striano]] &amp; [[Amrisha Vaish]] | title = Seven- to 9-month-old infants use facial expressions to interpret others' actions | journal = [[British Journal of Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 24 | pages = 753–760 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1348/026151005X70319 | issue = 4 | last2 = Vaish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the social world is increased by interaction with the physical environment. Training three-month-old infants to reach for objects with [[Velcro]]-covered "sticky mitts" increases the amount of attention that they pay to faces as compared to passively moving objects through their hands and non-trained control groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[Klaus Libertus]] &amp; [[Amy Needham]] | title = Reaching experience increases face preference in 3-month-old infants | journal = [[Developmental Science]] | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 1355–1364 |date=November 2011 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2011.01084.x | pmid = 22010895 | pmc = 3888836 | last2 = Needham }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In following with the notion that seven-month-olds have categorical understandings of emotion, they are also capable of associating emotional prosodies with corresponding facial expressions. When presented with a happy or angry face, shortly followed by an emotionally neutral word read in a happy or angry tone, their ERPs follow different patterns. Happy faces followed by angry vocal tones produce more changes than the other incongruous pairing, while there was no such difference between happy and angry congruous pairings, with the greater reaction implying that infants held greater expectations of a happy vocal tone after seeing a happy face than an angry tone following an angry face. Considering an infant's relative immobility and thus their decreased capacity to elicit negative reactions from their parents, this result implies that experience has a role in building comprehension of facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Crossmodal integration of emotional information from face and voice in the infant brain | journal = [[Developmental Science]] | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–315 |date=May 2006 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00494.x | pmid = 16669802 | last2 = Striano | last3 = Friederici |author1 = Tobias Grossmann|authorlink1 = Tobias Grossmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing and perceiving faces are vital abilities needed to coexist in society.

The [[face inversion effect]] provides behavioral support of a specialized mechanism as people tend to have greater deficits in task performance when prompted to react to an inverted face than to an inverted object.  Electrophysiological support comes from the finding that the N170 and M170 responses tend to be face-specific.  Neuro-imaging studies such as PET and fMRI studies have shown support for a specialized facial processing mechanism as they have identified regions of the fusiform gyrus that have higher activation during face perception tasks than other visual perception tasks.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Theories about the processes involved in adult face perception have largely come from two sources: research on normal adult face perception and the study of impairments in face perception that are caused by [[acquired brain injury|brain injury]] or [[neurological illness]]. Novel [[optical illusion]]s such as the [[Flashed Face Distortion Effect]], in which scientific [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] outpaces neurological theory, also provide areas for research.

One of the most widely accepted theories of face perception argues that understanding faces involves several stages:&lt;ref name=Bruce /&gt; from basic perceptual manipulations on the sensory information to derive details about the person (such as age, gender or attractiveness), to being able to recall meaningful details such as their name and any relevant past experiences of the individual.

This model (developed by psychologists [[Vicki Bruce]] and Andrew Young) argues that face perception might involve several independent sub-processes working in unison.
A "view centered description" is derived from the perceptual input. Simple physical aspects of the face are used to work out age, gender or basic facial expressions. Most analysis at this stage is on feature-by-feature basis. That initial information is used to create a structural model of the face, which allows it to be compared to other faces in memory, and across views. After several exposures to a face this structural code allows us to recognize that face in different contexts.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mansour|first=Jamal|last2=Lindsay|first2=Roderick|date=30 January 2010|title=Facial Recognition|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy0342/full|journal=Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology|volume=|pages=|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy0342}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why the same person seen from a novel angle can still be recognized. This structural encoding can be seen to be specific for upright faces as demonstrated by the [[Thatcher effect]]. The structurally encoded representation is transferred to notional "face recognition units" that are used with "personal identity nodes" to identify a person through information from [[semantic memory]]. The natural ability to produce someone's name when presented with their face has been shown in experimental research to be damaged in some cases of brain injury, suggesting that naming may be a separate process from the memory of other information about a person.

The study of [[prosopagnosia]] (an impairment in recognizing faces which is usually caused by brain injury) has been particularly helpful in understanding how normal face perception might work. Individuals with prosopagnosia may differ in their abilities to understand faces, and it has been the investigation of these differences which has suggested that several stage theories might be correct.

Face perception is an ability that involves many areas of the brain; however, some areas have been shown to be particularly important. Brain imaging studies typically show a great deal of activity in an area of the [[temporal lobe]] known as the [[fusiform gyrus]], an area also known to cause prosopagnosia when damaged (particularly when damage occurs on both sides). This evidence has led to a particular interest in this area and it is sometimes referred to as the ''[[fusiform face area]]'' (FFA) for that reason.&lt;ref name="Kanwisher N, McDermott J, Chun MM 1997 4302–11"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kanwisher N, McDermott J, Chun MM |title =The fusiform face area: a module in human extrastriate cortex specialized for face perception |journal=J.

===Neuroanatomy of facial processing===
There are several parts of the brain that play a role in face perception.

The majority of BOLD fMRI studies use blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast to determine which areas of the brain are activated by various cognitive functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=KannurpattiRypmaBiswal|first=S.S.B.|title=Prediction of task-related BOLD fMRI with amplitude signatures of resting-state fMRI|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|date=March 2012|volume=6|pages=1–7|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2012.00007|last2=Rypma|first2=Bart|last3=Biswal|first3=Bharat B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that the [[occipital face area]], located in the [[occipital lobe]], the fusiform face area, the [[superior temporal sulcus]], the amygdala, and the anterior/inferior cortex of the temporal lobe, all played roles in contrasting the faces from the cars, with the initial face perception beginning in the area and occipital face areas. This entire region links to form a network that acts to distinguish faces. The processing of faces in the brain is known as a "sum of parts" perception.&lt;ref name="Gold 2012 427–434"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gold|first=J.M.|author2=Mundy, P.J. |author3=Tjan, B.S. |title=The perception of a face is no more than the sum of its parts|journal=Psychological Science|year=2012|volume=23|issue=4|pages=427–434|doi=10.1177/0956797611427407|pmid=22395131|pmc=3410436}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the individual parts of the face must be processed first in order to put all of the pieces together.

The occipital face area is activated by the visual perception of single features of the face, for example, the nose and mouth, and preferred combination of two-eyes over other combinations. This research supports that the occipital face area recognizes the parts of the face at the early stages of recognition. On the contrary, the fusiform face area shows no preference for single features, because the fusiform face area is responsible for "holistic/configural" information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arcurio|first=L.R.|author2=Gold, J.M. |author3=James, T.W. |title=The response of face-selective cortex with single face parts and part combinations|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2012|volume=50|issue=10|pages=2458|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.06.016|pmid=22750118|pmc=3423083}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that it puts all of the processed pieces of the face together in later processing. This theory is supported by the work of Gold et al.&lt;ref name="Gold 2012 427–434"/&gt; who found that regardless of the orientation of a face, subjects were impacted by the configuration of the individual facial features. Subjects were also impacted by the coding of the relationships between those features. This shows that processing is done by a summation of the parts in the later stages of recognition.

Facial perception has well identified, neuroanatomical correlates in the brain. During the perception of faces, major activations occur in the extrastriate areas bilaterally, particularly in the fusiform face area, the occipital face area (OFA), and the superior temporal sulcus (fSTS).&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;Liu J, Harris A, Kanwisher N.

However, none of these results were found when perceiving a dog face, suggesting that this process may be specific to perception of human faces.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=7&amp;sid=89cf12cb-933b-4c76-94b7-04b68f01fa7e@sessionmgr103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#AN=17643154&amp;db=a9h|title=Testing holistic processing hypothesis in human and animal face perception:...: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fusiform face area is located in the lateral fusiform gyrus. It is thought that this area is involved in holistic processing of faces and it is sensitive to the presence of facial parts as well as the configuration of these parts. The fusiform face area is also necessary for successful face detection and identification. This is supported by fMRI activation and studies on prosopagnosia, which involves lesions in the fusiform face area.&lt;ref name="Liu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarthy 1997"/&gt;

The OFA is located in the inferior occipital gyrus.&lt;ref name="Rossion"/&gt; Similar to the FFA, this area is also active during successful face detection and identification, a finding that is supported by fMRI activation.&lt;ref name="Liu"/&gt; The OFA is involved and necessary in the analysis of facial parts but not in the spacing or configuration of facial parts. This suggests that the OFA may be involved in a facial processing step that occurs prior to the FFA processing.&lt;ref name="Liu"/&gt;

The fSTS is involved in recognition of facial parts and is not sensitive to the configuration of these parts. It is also thought that this area is involved in gaze perception.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = R. | last2 = Heywood | first2 = C.A. | last3 = Cowey | first3 = A. | last4 = Regard | first4 = M. | last5 = Landis | first5 = T. | year = 1990 | title = Sensitivity to eye gaze in prosopagnosic patients and monkeys with superior temporal sulcus ablation | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 28 | issue = 11| pages = 1123–1142 | doi=10.1016/0028-3932(90)90050-x| pmid = 2290489 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fSTS has demonstrated increased activation when attending to gaze direction.&lt;ref name="Liu"/&gt; Recent studies have tried to delineate whether fSTS area lights up while people use gaze of others in order to establish [[joint attention]] and not fSTS but another area (the gaze following patch which is still close to fSTS but not overlapping) was found to be the core of the gaze processing system in humans.&lt;ref name="Marquardt"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marquardt | first1 = K. | last2 = Ramezanpour | first2 = H. | last3 = Dicke | first3 = P. | last4 = Thier | first4 = P. | year = 2017 | title = Following eye gaze activates a patch in the posterior temporal cortex that is not part of the human "face patch" system  | journal = eNeuro | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 1-10 | doi=10.1523/ENEURO.0317-16.2017| pmid = 28374010 | pmc=5362938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorno-Tempini and Price have shown that the fusiform gyri are preferentially responsive to faces, whereas the parahippocampal/lingual gyri are responsive to buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gorno-Tempini ML, Price CJ |title=Identification of famous faces and buildings: a functional neuroimaging study of semantically unique items |journal=Brain |volume=124 |issue=Pt 10 |pages=2087–97 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11571224 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11571224 |doi=10.1093/brain/124.10.2087|last2=Price }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that while certain areas respond selectively to faces, facial processing involves many neural networks. These networks include visual and emotional processing systems as well. Emotional face processing research has demonstrated that there are some of the other functions at work. While looking at faces displaying emotions (especially those with fear facial expressions) compared to neutral faces there is increased activity in the right fusiform gyrus. This increased activity also correlates with increased amygdala activity in the same situations.&lt;ref name="Vuilleumier"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vuilleumier | first1 = P | last2 = Pourtois | first2 = G | year = 2007 | title = Distributed and interactive brain mechanisms during emotion face perception: Evidence from functional neuroimaging | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 45 | issue = 1| pages = 174–194 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.06.003| pmid = 16854439 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional processing effects observed in the fusiform gyrus are decreased in patients with amygdala lesions.&lt;ref name="Vuilleumier"/&gt; This demonstrates possible connections between the amygdala and facial processing areas.&lt;ref name="Vuilleumier"/&gt;

Another aspect that affects both the fusiform gyrus and the amygdala activation is the familiarity of faces. Having multiple regions that can be activated by similar face components indicates that facial processing is a complex process.&lt;ref name="Vuilleumier"/&gt; Platek and Kemp (2009) further showed increased brain activation in precuneus and cuneus when differentiation of two faces are easy (e.g., kin and familiar non-kin faces) and the role of posterior medial substrates for visual processing of faces with familiar features (e.g., faces that are averaged with the face of a sibling).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Platek|first=Steven M.|last2=Kemp|first2=Shelly M.|date=2009-02-01|title=Is family special to the brain?

Ishai and colleagues have proposed the object form topology hypothesis, which posits that there is a topological organization of neural substrates for object and facial processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ishai A, Ungerleider LG, Martin A, Schouten JL, Haxby JV |title=Distributed representation of objects in the human ventral visual pathway |journal=Proc.

Most neuroanatomical substrates for facial processing are perfused by the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Therefore, facial processing has been studied using measurements of mean cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral arteries bilaterally. During facial recognition tasks, greater changes in the right middle cerebral artery (RMCA) than the left (LMCA) have been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Droste DW, Harders AG, Rastogi E |title=A transcranial Doppler study of blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral arteries performed at rest and during mental activities |journal=Stroke |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=1005–11 |date=August 1989 |pmid=2667197 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=2667197|doi=10.1161/01.STR.20.8.1005|last2=Harders |last3=Rastogi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Harders AG, Laborde G, Droste DW, Rastogi E |title=Brain activity and blood flow velocity changes: a transcranial Doppler study |journal =Int.

===Hemispheric asymmetries in facial processing capability===
The mechanisms underlying gender-related differences in facial processing have not been studied extensively.

Studies using electrophysiological techniques have demonstrated gender-related differences during a face recognition memory (FRM) task and a facial affect identification task (FAIT).

It may suggest that the latter extends from the area implicated in object perception to a much greater area involved in facial perception.

This agrees with the object form topology hypothesis proposed by Ishai and colleagues in 1999. However, the relatedness of object and facial perception was process-based, and appears to be associated with their common holistic processing strategy in the right hemisphere. Moreover, when the same men were presented with facial paradigm requiring analytic processing, the left hemisphere was activated. This agrees with the suggestion made by Gauthier in 2000, that the extrastriate cortex contains areas that are best suited for different computations, and described as the process-map model. Therefore, the proposed models are not mutually exclusive, and this underscores the fact that facial processing does not impose any new constraints on the brain other than those used for other stimuli.

It may be suggested that each stimulus was mapped by category into face or non-face, and by process into holistic or analytic. Therefore, a unified category-specific process-mapping system was implemented for either right or left cognitive styles. Njemanze in 2007, concluded that, for facial perception, men used a category-specific process-mapping system for right cognitive style, but women used same for the left.

===Cognitive neuroscience===

Cognitive neuroscientists [[Isabel Gauthier]] and [[Michael Tarr]] are two of the major proponents of the view that face recognition involves expert discrimination of similar objects (See the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060509092446/http://www.psy.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/gauthier/PEN/ Perceptual Expertise Network]). Other scientists, in particular [[Nancy Kanwisher]] and her colleagues, argue that face recognition involves processes that are face-specific and that are not recruited by expert discriminations in other object classes (see the [http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/expertise.shtml domain specificity]).

Studies by Gauthier have shown that an area of the brain known as the fusiform gyrus (sometimes called the fusiform face area because it is active during face recognition) is also active when study participants are asked to discriminate between different types of birds and cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gauthier I, Skudlarski P, Gore JC, Anderson AW |title=Expertise for cars and birds recruits brain areas involved in face recognition |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=191–7 |date=February 2000 |pmid=10649576 |doi=10.1038/72140|last2=Skudlarski |last3=Gore |last4=Anderson }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even when participants become expert at distinguishing computer generated nonsense shapes known as [[greeble (psychology)|greebles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gauthier I, Tarr MJ, Anderson AW, Skudlarski P, Gore JC |title=Activation of the middle fusiform 'face area' increases with expertise in recognizing novel objects |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=568–73 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10448223 |doi= 10.1038/9224|last2=Tarr |last3=Anderson |last4=Skudlarski |last5=Gore }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the fusiform gyrus may have a general role in the recognition of similar visual objects. Yaoda Xu, then a post doctoral fellow with Nancy Kanwisher, replicated the car and bird expertise study using an improved fMRI design that was less susceptible to attentional accounts.

The activity found by Gauthier when participants viewed non-face objects was not as strong as when participants were viewing faces, however this could be because we have much more expertise for faces than for most other objects. Furthermore, not all findings of this research have been successfully replicated, for example, other research groups using different study designs have found that the fusiform gyrus is specific to faces and other nearby regions deal with non-face objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Grill-Spector K, Knouf N, Kanwisher N |title=The fusiform face area subserves face perception, not generic within-category identification |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=555–62 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15077112 |doi=10.1038/nn1224|last2=Knouf |last3=Kanwisher }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these failures to replicate are difficult to interpret, because studies vary on too many aspects of the method. It has been argued that some studies test experts with objects that are slightly outside of their domain of expertise. More to the point, failures to replicate are null effects and can occur for many different reasons. In contrast, each replication adds a great deal of weight to a particular argument. With regard to "face specific" effects in neuroimaging, there are now multiple replications with Greebles, with birds and cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Xu Y |title=Revisiting the role of the fusiform face area in visual expertise |journal=Cereb. Cortex |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=1234–42 |date=August 2005 |pmid=15677350 |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhi006 |url=http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15677350}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two unpublished studies with chess experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Righi G, Tarr MJ |title=Are chess experts any different from face, bird, or greeble experts? |journal=Journal of Vision |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=504–504 |year=2004 |url=http://journalofvision.org/4/8/504/ |doi=10.1167/4.8.504|last2=Tarr }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLQbTd6RFhY] My Brilliant Brain, partly about grandmaster Susan Polgar, shows brain scans of the fusiform gyrus while Polgar viewed chess diagrams.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is sometimes found that expertise recruits the FFA (e.g. as hypothesized by a proponent of this view in the preceding paragraph), a more common and less controversial finding is that expertise leads to focal category-selectivity in the fusiform gyrus—a pattern similar in terms of antecedent factors and neural specificity to that seen for faces. As such, it remains an open question as to whether face recognition and expert-level object recognition recruit similar neural mechanisms across different subregions of the fusiform or whether the two domains literally share the same neural substrates. Moreover, at least one study argues that the issue as to whether expertise-predicated category-selective areas overlap with the FFA is nonsensical in that multiple measurements of the FFA within an individual person often overlap no more with each other than do measurements of FFA and expertise-predicated regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kung CC, Peissig JJ, Tarr MJ |title=Is region-of-interest overlap comparison a reliable measure of category specificity? |journal=J Cogn Neurosci |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=2019–34 |date=December 2007 |pmid=17892386 |doi=10.1162/jocn.2007.19.12.2019 |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn.2007.19.12.2019?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov|last2=Peissig |last3=Tarr }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, numerous studies have failed to replicate them altogether.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} For example, four published fMRI studies have asked whether expertise has any specific connection to the FFA in particular, by testing for expertise effects in both the FFA and a nearby but not face-selective region called LOC (Rhodes et al., JOCN 2004; Op de Beeck et al., JN 2006; Moore et al., JN 2006; Yue et al. VR 2006). In all four studies, expertise effects are significantly stronger in the LOC than in the FFA, and indeed expertise effects were only borderline significant in the FFA in two of the studies, while the effects were robust and significant in the LOC in all four studies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Therefore, it is still not clear in exactly which situations the fusiform gyrus becomes active, although it is certain that face recognition relies heavily on this area and damage to it can lead to severe face recognition impairment.

===Self-face perception=== 
Studies regarding face perception have also looked specifically at self-face perception.  One study found that the perception/recognition of one's own face was unaffected by changing contexts, while the perception/recognition of familiar and unfamiliar faces was adversely affected.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Another study that focused on older adults found that they had self-face advantage in configural processing but not featural processing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Face advantage in memory recall==
During face perception, neural networks make connections with the brain to recall memories.&lt;ref name="Mansour 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mansour|first=Jamal|author2=Lindsay, Roderick|title=Facial Recognition|journal=Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology|date=30 January 2010|volume=1–2|doi=10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy0342|isbn=9780470479216}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Seminal Model of face perception, there are three stages of face processing including recognition of the face, the recall of memories and information that are linked with that face, and finally name recall.&lt;ref name=Bruce&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruce|first=V.|author2=Young, A|title=Understanding Face Recognition|journal=British Journal of Psychology|year=1986|issue=3|pages=305–327|pmid=3756376|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1986.tb02199.x|volume=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mansour 2010"/&gt; There are, however, exceptions to this order. For example, names are recalled faster than semantic information in cases of highly familiar stimuli.&lt;ref name=calderwood&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calderwood|first=L|author2=Burton, A.M.|title=Children and adults recall the names of highly familiar faces faster than semantic information|journal=British Journal of Psychology|date=November 2006|volume=96|issue=4|pages=441–454|doi=10.1348/000712605X84124}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the face is powerful identifier of individuals, the voice also helps in the recognition of people and is an identifier for important information.&lt;ref name=ellis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Hadyn|author2=Jones, Dylan|title=Intra- and Inter-modal repetition priming of familiar faces and voices|journal=British Journal of Psychology|date=February 1997|volume=88|issue=1|pages=143–156|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1997.tb02625.x|last3=Mosdell|first3=Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nadal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nadal|first=Lynn|title=Speaker Recognition|journal=Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science|year=2005|volume=4|pages=142–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has been conducted to see if faces or voices make it easier to identify individuals and recall [[semantic memory]] and [[episodic memory]].&lt;ref name="seed"/&gt; These experiments look at all three stages of face processing. The experiment method was to show two groups celebrity and familiar faces or voices with a [[between-group design]] and ask the participants to recall information about them.&lt;ref name=seed&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bredart|first=S.|author2=Barsics, C.|title=Recalling Semantic and Episodic Information From Faces and Voices: A Face Advantage|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=3 December 2012|volume=21|issue=6|pages=378–381|doi=10.1177/0963721412454876}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants are first asked if the stimulus is familiar. If they answer yes then they are asked to information (semantic memory) and memories they have of the person (episodic memory) that fits the face or voice presented. These experiments all demonstrate the strong phenomenon of the face advantage and how it persists through different follow-up studies with different experimental controls and variables.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt;

===Recognition-performance issue===
After the first experiments on the advantage of faces over voices in memory recall, errors and gaps were found in the methods used.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt; For one, there was not a clear face advantage for the recognition stage of face processing. Participants showed a familiarity-only response to voices more often than faces.&lt;ref name="Hanley 2009 830–839"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanley|first=J. Richard|author2=Damjanovic, Ljubica|title=It is more difficult to retrieve a familiar person's name and occupation from their voice than from their blurred face|journal=Memory|date=November 2009|volume=17|issue=8|pages=830–839|doi=10.1080/09658210903264175|pmid=19882434}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, when voices were recognized (about 60-70% of the time) they were much harder to recall biographical information but very good at being recognized.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt; The results were looked at as [[remember versus know judgements]]. A lot more remember results (or familiarity) occurred with voices, and more know (or memory recall) responses happened with faces.&lt;ref name=nadal /&gt; This phenomenon persists through experiments dealing with criminal line-ups in prisons. Witnesses are more likely to say that a suspect's voice sounded familiar than his/her face even though they cannot remember anything about the suspect.&lt;ref name=yarmey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yarmey|first=Daniel A.|title=Face and Voice Identifications in showups and lineups|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|date=1 January 1994|volume=8|issue=5|pages=453–464|doi=10.1002/acp.2350080504|last2=Yarmey|first2=A. Linda|last3=Yarmey|first3=Meagan J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrepancy is due to a larger amount of guesswork and false alarms that occur with voices.&lt;ref name=nadal /&gt;

To give faces a similar ambiguity to that of voices, the face stimuli were blurred in the follow-up experiment&lt;ref name="Hanley 2009 830–839"/&gt;  This experiment followed the same procedures as the first, presenting two groups with sets of stimuli made up of half celebrity faces and half unfamiliar faces.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt; The only difference was that the face stimuli were blurred so that detailed features could not be seen.  Participants were then asked to say if they recognized the person, if they could recall specific biographical information about them, and finally if they knew the person's name. The results were completely different from those of the original experiment, supporting the view that there were problems in the first experiment's methods.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt; According to the results of the followup, the same amount of information and memory could be recalled through voices and faces, dismantling the face advantage. However, these results are flawed and premature because other methodological issues in the experiment still needed to be fixed.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt;

===Content of speech===
The process of controlling the content of speech extract has proven to be more difficult than the elimination of non facial cues in photographs.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt;  Thus the findings of experiments that did not control this factor lead to misleading conclusions regarding the voice recognition over the face recognition.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt;  For example, in an experiment it was found that 40% of the time participants could easily pair the celebrity-voice with their occupation just by guessing.&lt;ref name="Hanley 2009 830–839"/&gt; In order to eliminate these errors, experimenters removed parts of the voice samples that could possibly give clues to the identity of the target, such as catchphrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Lancker|first=Diana|author2=Kreiman, Jody|title=Voice discrimination and recognition are separate abilities|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=January 1987|volume=25|issue=5|pages=829–834|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(87)90120-5|pmid=3431677}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Even after controlling the voice samples as well as the face samples (using blurred faces), studies have shown that semantic information can be more accessible to retrieve when individuals are recognizing faces than voices.&lt;ref name="Barsics &amp; Bredart 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barsics|first=Catherine|author2=Brédart, Serge|title=Recalling episodic information about personally known faces and voices|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=June 2011|volume=20|issue=2|pages=303–308|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.03.008|pmid=20381380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technique to control the content of the speech extracts is to present the faces and voices of personally familiar individuals, like the participant's teachers or neighbors, instead of the faces and voices of celebrities.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt;  In this way alike words are used for the speech extracts.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt;  For example, the familiar targets are asked to read exactly the same scripted speech for their voice extracts. The results showed again that semantic information is easier to retrieve when individuals are recognizing faces than voices.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt;

===Frequency-of-exposure issue===
Another factor that has to be controlled in order for the results to be reliable is the frequency of exposure.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt;  If we take the example of celebrities, people are exposed to celebrities' faces more often than their voices because of the mass media.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt;  Through magazines, newspapers and the Internet, individuals are exposed to celebrities' faces without their voices on an everyday basis rather than their voices without their faces.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt; Thus, someone could argue that for all of the experiments that were done until now the findings were a result of the frequency of exposure to the faces of celebrities rather than their voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ethofer|first=edited by Belin Pascal, Salvatore Campanella, Thomas|title=Integrating face and voice in person perception|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4614-3584-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To overcome this problem researchers decided to use personally familiar individuals as stimuli instead of celebrities.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt;  Personally familiar individuals, such as participant's teachers, are for the most part heard as well as seen.&lt;ref name="barsics and bredart and hanley 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brédart|first=Serge|author2=Barsics, Catherine |author3=Hanley, Rick |title=Recalling semantic information about personally known faces and voices|journal=European Journal of Cognitive Psychology|date=November 2009|volume=21|issue=7|pages=1013–1021|doi=10.1080/09541440802591821}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies that used this type of control also demonstrated the face advantage.&lt;ref name="barsics and bredart and hanley 2009"/&gt;  Students were able to retrieve semantic information more readily when recognizing their teachers faces (both normal and blurred)rather their voices.&lt;ref name="Barsics &amp; Bredart 2011" /&gt;

However, researchers over the years have found an even more effective way to control not only the frequency of exposure but also the content of the speech extracts, the [[Learning|associative learning]] paradigm.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt;  Participants are asked to link semantic information as well as names with pre-experimentally unknown voices and faces.&lt;ref name="barsics and bredart 2012b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barsics|first=Catherine|author2=Brédart, Serge|title=Recalling semantic information about newly learned faces and voices|journal=Memory|date=July 2012|volume=20|issue=5|pages=527–534|doi=10.1080/09658211.2012.683012|pmid=22646520}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Associative learning paradigm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning.|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/estinsects/learning|work=Encyclopedia of Insects.|publisher=Oxford: Elsevier Science &amp; Technology|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a current experiment that used this paradigm, a name and a profession were given together with, accordingly, a voice, a face or both to three participant groups.&lt;ref name="barsics and bredart 2012b" /&gt;  The associations described above were repeated four times.&lt;ref name="barsics and bredart 2012b" /&gt;  The next step was a [[Recall (memory)|cued recall]] task in which every stimulus that was learned in the previous phase was introduced and participants were asked to tell the profession and the name for every stimulus.&lt;ref name="barsics and bredart 2012b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cued recall task"&gt;{{cite web|title=Memory, Explicit and Implicit.|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/esthumanbrain/memory_explicit_and_implicit|work=Encyclopedia of the Human Brain.|publisher=Oxford: Elsevier Science &amp; Technology|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Again, the results showed that semantic information can be more accessible to retrieve when individuals are recognizing faces than voices even when the frequency of exposure was controlled.&lt;ref name=seed /&gt;&lt;ref name="barsics and bredart 2012b" /&gt;

===Extension to episodic memory and explanation for existence===
[[Episodic memory]] is our ability to remember specific, previously experienced events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2005 |title=Episodic Memory, Computational Models of |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Chichester, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of faces as it pertains to episodic memory, there has been shown to be activation in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, [[parietal lobe]], and the left medial frontal/anterior cingulate cortex.&lt;ref name="Leube 2003 97–101"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leube|first=Dirk T.|author2=Erb, Michael |author3=Grodd, Wolfgang |author4=Bartels, Mathias |author5= Kircher, Tilo T.J. |title=Successful episodic memory retrieval of newly learned faces activates a left fronto-parietal network|journal=Cognitive Brain Research|date=December 2003|volume=18|issue=1|pages=97–101|doi=10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2003.09.008|pmid=14659501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hofer|first=Alex|author2=Siedentopf, Christian M. |author3=Ischebeck, Anja |author4=Rettenbacher, Maria A. |author5=Verius, Michael |author6=Golaszewski, Stefan M. |author7=Felber, Stephan |author8= Fleischhacker, W.

==Ethnicity==
{{main article|Cross-race effect}}
Differences in own- versus other-race face recognition and perceptual discrimination was first researched in 1914.&lt;ref name="Feingold"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Feingold CA | year = 1914 | title = The influence of environment on identification of persons and things | url = | journal = Journal of Criminal Law and Police Science | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 39–51 | doi=10.2307/1133283| jstor = 1133283 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans tend to perceive people of other races than their own to all look alike:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Other things being equal, individuals of a given race are distinguishable from each other in proportion to our familiarity, to our contact with the race as whole. Thus, to the uninitiated American all Asiatics look alike, while to the Asiatics, all White men look alike.&lt;ref name="Feingold"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This phenomenon is known mainly as the [[cross-race effect]], but is also called the own-race effect, other-race effect, own race bias or interracial-face-recognition-deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Walker PM, Tanaka JW |title=An encoding advantage for own-race versus other-race faces |journal=Perception |volume=32 |issue=9 |pages=1117–25 |year=2003 |pmid=14651324 |doi=10.1068/p5098|last2=Tanaka }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Mullen reported finding evidence that the other-race effect is larger among White subjects than among African American subjects, whereas Brigham and Williamson (1979, cited in Shepherd, 1981) obtained the opposite pattern.&lt;ref name="otherrace"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindsay|first=D.

Stephen Lindsay and colleagues note that results in these studies could be due to intrinsic difficulty in recognizing the faces presented, an actual difference in the size of cross-race effect between the two test groups, or some combination of these two factors.&lt;ref name="otherrace" /&gt; Shepherd reviewed studies that found better performance on both African American&lt;ref&gt;Chance, Goldstein, &amp; McBride, 1975; Feinman &amp; Entwistle, 1976; cited in Shepherd, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; and White faces,&lt;ref&gt;Malpass &amp; Kravitz, 1969; Cross, Cross, &amp; Daly, 1971; Shepherd, Deregowski, &amp; Ellis, 1974; all cited in Shepherd, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; and yet Shepherd also reviewed other studies in which no difference was found.&lt;ref&gt;Brigham &amp; Karkowitz, 1978; Brigham &amp; Williamson, 1979; cited in Shepherd, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Shepherd reported a reliable positive correlation between the size of the effect and the amount of interaction subjects had with members of the other race. This correlation reflects the fact that African American subjects, who performed equally well on faces of both races in Shepherd's study, almost always responded with the highest possible self-rating of amount of interaction with white people (M = 4.75; 5 being the most interaction with people of that race, 1 being the least), whereas their white counterparts both displayed a larger other-race effect and reported less other-race interaction (M = 2.13). This difference in rating was found statistically reliable, £(30) = 7.86, p &lt; .01.&lt;ref name="otherrace" /&gt;

In a series of studies, Walker and colleagues revealed that participants with greater other-race experience were consistently more accurate at discriminating between other-race faces than were participants with less other-race experience (Walker &amp; Tanaka, 2003; Walker &amp; [[Miles Hewstone|Hewstone]], 2006a,b; 2007).

Additionally, individuals with ASD display difficulty with [[recognition memory]], specifically memory that aids in identifying faces. The memory deficit is selective for faces and does not extend to other objects or visual inputs.&lt;ref name=Weigelt /&gt; Some evidence lends support to the theory that these face-memory deficits are products of interference between connections of face processing regions.&lt;ref name=Weigelt /&gt;

===Associated difficulties===
The atypical facial processing style of people with ASD often manifests in constrained social ability, due to decreased eye contact, [[joint attention]], interpretation of emotional expression, and communicative skills.&lt;ref name=Triesch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Triesch|first=Jochen|author2=Teuscher, Christof |author3=Deak, Gedeon O. |author4= Carlson, Eric |title=Gaze following: why (not) learn it?|journal=Developmental Science|year=2006|volume=9|issue=2|pages=125–157|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00470.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deficiencies can be seen in infants as young as 9 months; specifically in terms of poor eye contact and difficulties engaging in joint attention.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt;  Some experts have even used the term 'face avoidance' to describe the phenomena where infants who are later diagnosed with ASD preferentially attend to non-face objects over faces.&lt;ref name=tanakabook /&gt; Furthermore, some have proposed that the demonstrated impairment in children with ASD's ability to grasp emotional content of faces is not a reflection of the incapacity to process emotional information, but rather, the result of a general inattentiveness to facial expression.&lt;ref name=tanakabook /&gt; The constraints of these processes that are essential to the development of communicative and social-cognitive abilities are viewed to be the cause of impaired social engagement and responsivity.&lt;ref name=Volkmar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Volkmar|first=Fred|author2=Chawarska, Kasia |author3=Klin, Ami |title=Autism in infancy and early childhood|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|year=2005|volume=56|pages=315–316|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070159|pmid=15709938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, research suggests that there exists a link between decreased face processing abilities in individuals with ASD and later deficits in [[Theory of Mind]]; for example, while typically developing individuals are able to relate others' emotional expressions to their actions, individuals with ASD do not demonstrate this skill to the same extent.&lt;ref name=grosbois&gt;{{cite book|last=Nader-Grosbois|first=N.|title=International handbook of autism and pervasive developmental disorders|year=2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|location=New York|isbn=9781441980649|pages=127–157|author2=Day, J.M.|editor=Matson, J.L |editor2=Sturmey, R.|chapter=Emotional cognition: theory of mind and face recognition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some contention about this causation however, resembling the [[chicken or the egg]] dispute. Others theorize that social impairment leads to perceptual problems rather than vice versa.&lt;ref name=Grelotti /&gt; In this perspective, a biological lack of social interest inherent to ASD inhibits developments of facial recognition and perception processes due to underutilization.&lt;ref name=Grelotti /&gt; Continued research is necessary to determine which theory is best supported.

===Neurology ===
Many of the obstacles that individuals with ASD face in terms of facial processing may be derived from abnormalities in the fusiform face area and amygdala, which have been shown to be important in face perception as discussed [[Face perception#Neuroanatomy of facial processing|above]]. Typically, the fusiform face area in individuals with ASD has reduced volume compared to normally developed persons.&lt;ref name= Pierce&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierce|first=Karen|author2=Muller, R.A., Ambrose, J., Allen, G., Chourchesne|title=Face processing occurs outside the fusiform 'face area' in autism: evidence from functional MRI|url = http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/124/10/2059.full.pdf+html|journal=Brain|year=2001|volume=124|pages=2059–2073|accessdate=2013-02-13|issue=10|doi=10.1093/brain/124.10.2059}}&lt;/ref&gt; This volume reduction has been attributed to deviant amygdala activity that does not flag faces as emotionally salient and thus decreases activation levels of the fusiform face area. This hypoactivity in the fusiform face area has been found in several studies.&lt;ref name=Grelotti /&gt;

Studies are not conclusive as to which brain areas people with ASD use instead. One study found that, when looking at faces, people with ASD exhibit activity in brain regions normally active when typically developing individuals perceive objects.&lt;ref name=Grelotti /&gt; Another study found that during facial perception, people with ASD use different neural systems, with each one of them using their own unique neural circuitry.&lt;ref name=Pierce /&gt;

===Compensation mechanisms===
As ASD individuals age, scores on behavioral tests assessing ability to perform face-emotion recognition increase to levels similar to controls.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Harms /&gt; Yet, it is apparent that the recognition mechanisms of these individuals are still atypical, though often effective.&lt;ref name=Harms&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harms|first=Madeline|author2=Martin, Alex |author3=Wallace, Gregory |title=Facial emotion recognition in autism spectrum disorders: A review of behavioral and neuroimaging studies|journal=Neuropsychology Review|year=2010|volume=20|issue=3|pages=290–322|doi=10.1007/s11065-010-9138-6|pmid=20809200}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of face identity-recognition, compensation can take many forms including a more pattern-based strategy which was first seen in [[Global precedence#Face inversion|face inversion]] tasks.&lt;ref name=Langdell /&gt; Alternatively, evidence suggests that older individuals compensate by using mimicry of other's facial expressions and rely on their motor feedback of facial muscles for face emotion-recognition.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Barry|author2=Clarke, Natalie |author3=Jordan, Jo |author4=Young, Andrew |author5=Clarke, Paula |author6=Miles, Jermey |author7=Nation, Kate |author8=Clarke, Leesa |author9= Williams, Christine  |title=Emotion recognition in faces and the use of visual context Vo in young people with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders|journal=Autism|year=2008|volume=12|issue=6|page=607–|doi=10.1177/1362361308097118}}&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies help overcome the obstacles individuals with ASD face in interacting within social contexts.

Neurobiologist [[Jenny Morton]] and her team have been able to teach sheep to choose a familiar face over unfamiliar one when presented with two photographs, which has led to the discovery that sheep can recognise human faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheep are able to recognise human faces from photographs|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/sheep-are-able-to-recognise-human-faces-from-photographs|website=University of Cambridge|accessdate=8 November 2017|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rincon|first1=Paul|title=Sheep 'can recognise human faces'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-41905652|website=BBC News|accessdate=8 November 2017|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archerfish (distant relatives of humans) were able to differentiate between forty-four different human faces, which supports the theory that there is no need for a neocortex or a history of discerning human faces in order to do so.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=19&amp;sid=89cf12cb-933b-4c76-94b7-04b68f01fa7e@sessionmgr103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#AN=119335637&amp;db=a9h|title=Face facts: Even nonhuman animals discriminate human faces: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pigeons were found to use the same parts of the brain as humans do to distinguish between happy and neutral faces or male and female faces.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt;

==Artificial==
A great deal of effort has been put into developing [[facial recognition system|software that can recognize human faces]]. Much of the work has been done by a branch of [[artificial intelligence]] known as [[computer vision]] which uses findings from the psychology of face perception to inform software design. Recent breakthroughs using noninvasive functional [[transcranial Doppler]] spectroscopy as demonstrated by Njemanze, 2007, to locate specific responses to facial stimuli have led to improved systems for facial recognition. The new system uses input responses called cortical long-term potentiation (CLTP) derived from Fourier analysis of mean blood flow velocity to trigger target face search from a computerized face database system.&lt;ref&gt;Njemanze, P.C. Transcranial doppler spectroscopy for assessment of brain cognitive functions. United States Patent Application No. 20040158155, August 12th, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Njemanze, P.C. Noninvasive transcranial doppler ultrasound face and object recognition testing system. United States Patent No. 6,773,400, August 10th, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Such a system provides for brain-machine interface for facial recognition, and the method has been referred to as cognitive [[biometrics]].

Another application is the estimation of human age from face images. As an important hint for human communication, facial images contain lots of useful information including gender, expression, age, etc. Unfortunately, compared with other cognition problems, age estimation from facial images is still very challenging. This is mainly because the aging process is influenced not only by a person's genes but also many external factors. Physical condition, living style etc. may accelerate or slow the aging process. Besides, since the aging process is slow and with long duration, collecting sufficient data for training is fairly demanding work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~huangyz/caip09_Long.pdf |title=Human age estimation by metric learning for regression problems |author=YangJing Long |journal=Proc.

== Genetic basis ==
While it has been widely recognized that many cognitive abilities, such as general intelligence, have genetic bases, evidence for the genetic basis of facial recognition abilities specifically is fairly recent. Some of the earliest published research on the relationship between facial recognition and genetics focused on the genetic bases of facial recognition in the context of genetic disorders which impair facial recognition abilities, such as [[Turner syndrome]]. In a study by Lawrence, K. et al. in 2003&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Kate|last2=Kuntsi|first2=Jonna|last3=Coleman|first3=Michael|last4=Campbell|first4=Ruth|last5=Skuse|first5=David|date=2003-01-01|title=Face and emotion recognition deficits in Turner syndrome: a possible role for X-linked genes in amygdala development|journal=Neuropsychology|volume=17|issue=1|pages=39–49|issn=0894-4105|pmid=12597072|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.17.1.39}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors found significantly poorer facial recognition abilities in individuals with Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder which results in impaired amygdala functioning, suggesting that amygdala functioning may impact face perception.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Evidence for the genetic basis of facial recognition abilities in the general population, however, comes from studies on face perception in twin participants by Wilmer, J. B. et al. in 2009,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilmer|first=Jeremy B.|last2=Germine|first2=Laura|last3=Chabris|first3=Christopher F.|last4=Chatterjee|first4=Garga|last5=Williams|first5=Mark|last6=Loken|first6=Eric|last7=Nakayama|first7=Ken|last8=Duchaine|first8=Bradley|date=2010-03-16|title=Human face recognition ability is specific and highly heritable|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=107|issue=11|pages=5238–5241|doi=10.1073/pnas.0913053107|issn=1091-6490|pmc=2841913|pmid=20176944}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the facial recognition scores on the [[Prosopagnosia|Cambridge Face Memory test]] were twice as similar for [[Twin|monozygotic]] twins in comparison to [[Twin|dizygotic]] twins.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This finding was supported by a twin study on the genetic bases of facial recognition by Zhu, Q. et al. in (2009) which found a similar difference in facial recognition scores when comparing [[Twin|monozygotic]] and [[Twin|dizygotic]] twins&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Qi|last2=Song|first2=Yiying|last3=Hu|first3=Siyuan|last4=Li|first4=Xiaobai|last5=Tian|first5=Moqian|last6=Zhen|first6=Zonglei|last7=Dong|first7=Qi|last8=Kanwisher|first8=Nancy|last9=Liu|first9=Jia|date=2010-01-26|title=Heritability of the specific cognitive ability of face perception|journal=Current Biology|volume=20|issue=2|pages=137–142|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.11.067|issn=1879-0445|pmid=20060296}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Shakeshaft, N.

This suggests that facial recognition abilities are not only heritable, but that their genetic basis is independent from the bases of other cognitive abilities and are specialized for face perception.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Research by Cattaneo, Z. et al. (2016)&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cattaneo|first=Zaira|last2=Daini|first2=Roberta|last3=Malaspina|first3=Manuela|last4=Manai|first4=Federico|last5=Lillo|first5=Mariarita|last6=Fermi|first6=Valentina|last7=Schiavi|first7=Susanna|last8=Suchan|first8=Boris|last9=Comincini|first9=Sergio|date=2016-12-17|title=Congenital prosopagnosia is associated with a genetic variation in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene: An exploratory study|journal=Neuroscience|volume=339|pages=162–173|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2016.09.040|issn=1873-7544|pmid=27693815}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggest that the more extreme examples of facial recognition abilities, specifically hereditary prosopagnosics, are also highly genetically correlated.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For hereditary prosopagnosics, an [[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal dominant]] model of inheritance has been proposed by Kennerknecht, I. et al.

(2016)&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; also correlated the probability of hereditary prosopagnosia with the presence of [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphisms]]&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; along the [[Oxytocin receptor|Oxytocin receptor gene]] (OXTR), specifically at nucleotides [http://snpedia.com/index.php/Rs2254298 rs2254298] and [https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs53576 rs53576] on OXTR [[intron]] three,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; suggesting that these [[allele]]s may serve a critical role in normal face perception. Mutation from the [[wild type]] allele at these [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] has also been found to result in other disorders in which social and facial recognition deficits are common,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; such as [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]], which may imply that the genetic bases for general facial recognition are complex and [[Polygene|polygenic]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This relationship between the OXTR gene and facial recognition abilities is also supported by studies of individuals who do not suffer from hereditary prosopagnosia by Melchers, M. et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16576">The '''Feldenkrais Method''' is a type of [[exercise therapy]] devised by [[Moshé Feldenkrais]] (1904–1984).  The method is claimed to reorganize connections between the brain and body and so improve body movement and psychological state.&lt;ref name=ehm/&gt;

There is no good [[evidence-based medicine|medical evidence]] that the Feldenkrais method confers any health benefits, and it is not known if it is safe or cost-effective,&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt; even though it is hard to conceive of serious risks.&lt;ref name="Corgi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=S|last2=Ernst|first2=E|title=Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial|date=2009|publisher=Corgi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness and reception==
In 2015, the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Australian Government's Department of Health]] published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by [[health insurance]]; the Feldenkrais Method was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found.&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S. Australian review finds no benefit to 17 natural therapies. Science-Based Medicine. |lay-date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly in 2017 the Australian government named  the Feldenkrais Method as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would "ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence".&lt;ref name=nosubsidy&gt;{{cite web |title=Homeopathy, naturopathy struck off private insurance list |author=Paola S |year=17 October 2017 |journal=Australian Journal of Pharmacy |url=https://ajp.com.au/news/homeopathy-naturopathy-struck-off-private-insurance-list/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known whether the Feldenkrais method is safe or cost-effective,&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt; though according to Ernst and Singh's overview of alternative medicine "there are no conceivable serious risks".&lt;ref name="Corgi"/&gt;

[[David Gorski]] has written that the Method bears similarities to [[faith healing]], is like "glorified [[yoga]]" and that it "borders on [[quackery]]".&lt;ref name=gorski/&gt;

The Feldenkrais Method is a type of alternative exercise therapy that proponents claim can repair impaired connections between the [[motor cortex]] and the body, so benefiting the quality of body movement and improving [[wellbeing]].&lt;ref name=ehm&gt;{{cite book |editors=Stalker D, Glymour C |page=373 |year=1989 |publisher=Prometheus Books |title=Examining Holistic Medicine |isbn=9780879755539 |quote=a system of exercise therapy developed in the 1940s by former judo instructor Moshe Feldenkrais}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Feldenkrais Guild of North America claims that the Feldenkrais method allows people to "rediscover [their] innate capacity for graceful, efficient movement" and that "These improvements will often generalize to enhance functioning in other aspects of [their] life".&lt;ref name=gorski&gt;{{cite web |author=Gorski D |authorlink=David Gorski |publisher=Scienceblogs&amp;mdash;Respectful Insolence |title=M.D. Anderson enters the blogosphere–and goes woo |date=6 August 2009 |url=http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/05/md-anderson-enters-the-blogosphere-and-g/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents claim that the Feldenkrais Method can benefit people with a number of medical conditions, including children with [[autism]], and people with [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name=autism-claim&gt;{{cite web |title=How the Feldenkrais Method can Benefit Children with Autism |publisher=Feldenkrais Educational Foundation of North America |author=Adams A |date=30 April 2015 |url=http://www.feldenkrais.com/article_content.asp?edition=1&amp;section=9&amp;article=294 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918103015/http://www.feldenkrais.com/article_content.asp?edition=1&amp;section=9&amp;article=294 |archivedate=18 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ms-claim&gt;{{cite web |title=Maintaining Mobility:The Feldenkrais Method and Multiple Sclerosis |date=15 June 2015 |author=Dillon S |url=http://www.feldenkrais.com/article_content.asp?edition=1&amp;section=23&amp;article=44 |publisher=Feldenkrais Educational Foundation of North America |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918085542/http://www.feldenkrais.com/article_content.asp?edition=1&amp;section=23&amp;article=44 |archivedate=18 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Similar to some other somatic methods, such as those started by [[F. Matthias Alexander]], [[Elsa Gindler]], and [[Gerda Alexander]], the Feldenkrais Method originated in the efforts of its founder to work with his own bodily problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Don Hanlon|title=Bone, Breath, and Gesture: Practices of Embodiment|date=1995|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=1556432011|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Moshé Feldenkrais, it was a chronically injured knee.

Feldenkrais first injured his knee while playing soccer in British-controlled Palestine in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Reese&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reese|first1=Mark|title=Moshe Feldenkrais: A Life in Movement|date=2015|publisher=ReeseKress Somatics Press|location=San Rafael, California|isbn=978-0-9855612-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}} He reinjured it while negotiating the slippery decks of submarines while working as a scientist at the British Naval station at [[Fairlie, North Ayrshire]], Scotland during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doidge|first1=Norman|title=The Brain's Way of Healing|date=2015|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-312837-3|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldenkrais was by that time a Judo teacher and had mostly completed the work toward a D.Sc. under the guidance of Nobel laureate [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]].&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|208}} Facing the prospect of a surgery that could leave him with a life-long limp, Feldenkrais decided to apply the knowledge gained from his study of physics, engineering, and martial arts to an intensive self-study of his own movement habits. When his work provided him with relief, allowing him to avoid the knee surgery, he began exploring the methods he developed on himself with a small group of people at Fairlie, including scientific colleague [[John Desmond Bernal]] and [[John Boyd-Orr]], Nobel laureate and first president of the World Academy of Art and Science.&lt;ref name="Elusive Obvious"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feldenkrais|first1=Moshe|title=The Elusive Obvious|date=1981|publisher=Meta Publications|location=Capitola, California|isbn=978-0-916990-09-1|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving as head of electronic engineering for the Israeli Army in newly formed Israel from 1951 to 1953, Feldenkrais devoted the rest of his life, from age 50 onward, to developing and teaching self-awareness through movement lessons.&lt;ref name= "Claire"&gt;{{cite book |last= Claire |first= Thomas |year= 1995 |title= Bodywork: What Type of Massage to Get and How to Make the Most of It |publisher= [[William Morrow and Co.]] |pages= 75–88 |isbn= 9781591201656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Hanna, "Moshe Feldenkrais"'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanna|first1=Thomas|title="Moshe Feldenkrais", in ''Explorers of Humankind''|date=1979|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-06-250375-8|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s till his death in 1984, he taught continuously in his home city of Tel Aviv. Feldenkrais gained recognition in part through media accounts of his work with prominent individuals, including Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]].&lt;ref name="Ben Gurion's Personal Trainer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lori|first1=Aviva|title=Ben Gurion's Personal Trainer|url=http://www.haaretz.com/ben-gurion-s-personal-trainer-1.124885|website=Haaretz.com|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feldenkrais Biography-First Chapter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buckard|first1=Christian|title=Feldenkrais Biography-First Chapter|url=http://www.feldenkrais-biographie.de/buch-news/english/|website=feldenkrais-biographie|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the late 1950s, Feldenkrais made trips to teach in Europe and America. Several hundred people became certified Feldenkrais practitioners through trainings he held in San Francisco from 1975 to 1978 and in Amherst, Massachusetts from 1980 to 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keller|first1=Jon|last2=Freer|first2=Bonnie|title=His Methods May Seem Bizarre, But Thousands Swear by Mind-Body Guru Moshe Feldenkrais|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20080162,00.html|website=people.com|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating the need for an institutional structure to carry on his teaching, he helped found the Feldenkrais Guild of North America in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanna|first1=Thomas|title="Moshe Feldenkrais" in Explorers of Humankind|date=1979|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco, California|isbn=0-06-250375-8|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldenkrais developed the conceptual framework of his method in part through the publication of six books, beginning with ''Body and Mature Behavior'' (1949) and ending with the posthumously published ''The Potent Self'' (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moshe Feldenkrais Bibliography|url=http://www.feldenkraismethod.com/articles/moshe-feldenkrais-bibliography|website=Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais – His Life and Work|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Feldenkrais' death, the international Feldenkrais community has used a guild structure to regulate its activity, with training accreditation boards in the Americas, Europe, and Australasia overseeing guilds and associations in eighteen member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Member Organizations|url=http://feldenkrais-method.org/iff/member-organizations/|website=International Feldenkrais Federation|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Feldenkrais Journal'', the annual publication of the Feldenkrais Guild of North America, serves as a forum for the Feldenkrais community to discuss the method and its applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Feldenkrais Journal|url=http://www.feldenkrais.com/the-feldenkrais-journal|website=Feldenkrais Guild of North America|accessdate=4 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524124542/http://www.feldenkrais.com/the-feldenkrais-journal|archivedate=24 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
The development of the Feldenkrais Method was influenced by Moshe Feldenkrais's involvement in the martial arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marlock|first1=Gustl|title=The Handbook of Body Psychotherapy and Somatic Psychology|date=2015|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=9781583948415|page=876|url=https://www.northatlanticbooks.com/shop/the-handbook-of-body-psychotherapy-and-somatic-psychology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|71}} After meeting [[Kano Jigoro]], the founder of Judo, while living in Paris in the 1930s, Feldenkrais transitioned to that practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buchanan|first1=Patricia|title="The Feldenkrais Method® of Somatic Education"|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/a-compendium-of-essays-on-alternative-therapy/the-feldenkrais-method-of-somatic-education|website=A Compendium of Essays on Alternative Therapy|publisher=InTech|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main influences of judo on the Feldenkrais Method is the differentiation between rote exercise and attentive movement: "the methods of physical exercise in vogue&amp;nbsp;... exert only the muscles without any other goal, and one needs much will to bind oneself unfailingly to one of these methods", wrote Feldenkrais in 1952. "Judo is very different, each movement has a specific goal which is reached after a precise and supple execution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feldenkrais|first1=Moshe|title=A.B.C. du Judo: Jiu-Jitsu|date=1952|publisher=Chiron|location=France}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before he focused on the creation of his own method, Feldenkrais influenced the teaching of martial arts in Western Europe through the publication of five books on jiujitsu and judo, as well as teaching at practice centers in France and Great Britain.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|211–212}}

Feldenkrais was born into an Hasidic family and community, and he acknowledged the influence of Hasidic Judaism on his method.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|7}} In his 2007 book, ''Making Connections: Roots and Resonance in the Life of Moshe Feldenkrais'', David Kaetz argued that there are many lines of influence to be found between the Judaism of Feldenkrais's upbringing and the Feldenkrais Method – for instance, the use of paradox as a pedagogical tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaetz|first1=David|title=Making Connections: Roots and Resonance in the Life and Teachings of Moshe Feldenkrais|date=2014|publisher=River Centre Publishing|location=Hornby Island, Canada|isbn=978-0-9784014-2-9|pages=13–15, 27–28|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldenkrais also acknowledged the influence of the Russian spiritualist [[George Gurdjieff]] on his work, in particular Gurdjieff's teachings on automatism and freedom in embodiment.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|430–444}}

Feldenkrais earned his doctorate in a program at the Sorbonne intended to bridge theoretical physics and industrial engineering.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|128–129}} Feldenkrais's biographer, Mark Reese, argues that Feldenkrais brought this emphasis on practical scientific inquiry to the understanding of embodiment expressed through his method: "Feldenkrais was critical of the appropriation of the term 'energy' to express immeasurable phenomena or to label experiences that people had trouble describing", notes Reese. "He was impatient when someone invoked energy in pseudoscientific 'explanations' that masked a lack of understanding. In such cases he urged skepticism and scientific discourse. He encouraged empirical and phenomenological narratives that could lead to insights."&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|117}} Feldenkrais incorporated the views of other scientists into his teaching; for instance, he asked questions of both the neurosurgeon [[Karl H. Pribram]] and the cyberneticist [[Heinz von Foerster]] at trainings in San Francisco in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feldenkrais|first1=Moshe|title=The Elusive Obvious|date=1981|publisher=Meta Publications|location=Capitola, California|isbn=0-916990-09-5|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|329–330}} [[Cybernetics]], also known as dynamic systems theory, continued to influence the Feldenkrais Method in the 1990s through the work of human development researcher [[Esther Thelen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buchanan|first1=Patricia|title=The Feldenkrais Method® of Somatic Education|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/a-compendium-of-essays-on-alternative-therapy/the-feldenkrais-method-of-somatic-education|website=Intechopen.com|publisher=InTech|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminism]] is a collection of movements and ideologies that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve equal political, economic, cultural, personal, and social rights for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawkesworth|first1=M.E.|title=Globalization and Feminist Activism.

[[Feminist movements]] started in the West in the late 19th century and its development has three ways of evolution. [[First-wave feminism]] was about the status of white women of middle and upper-classes, suffrage and their political equality. [[Second-wave feminism]] went further in dealing with inequalities in social and economic spheres. [[Third-wave feminism]] deals with financial, social and cultural inequalities and women’s rights in politics and media.
Feminism may be found almost in each country around the world. This article will focus on the case of [[Latin America]] and peculiarities of feminism there, as well as the concept of Latin American Feminist Theory.

However, there is an opinion that the classical division of the periods taken from the example of the USA does not fit to some extent feminism evolution in Latin America, namely the time of second and third waves in Americas are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Francesca|title=Latin American Women and the Search for Social Justice|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the one hand, there is an opinion shared by many people that feminism in Latin _America was a western product. On the other hand, some studies, for example, Francesca Miller’s Latin American Women and the Search for Social Justice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Francesca|title=Latin American Women and the Search for Social Justice|date=1991|publisher=University Press of New England}}&lt;/ref&gt; prove that it has been rather an ideology that appeared in the region over the last century. However, evidence also points to Latin American women advocating for equal rights as early as the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mother's Making Latin America: Genders, Households, and Politics since 1825|last=O'Conner|first=Erin|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=978-1118271445|location=US|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of the emergence of feminism in Latin America ==

There is a fairly solid consensus among academics and activists that women’s participation in leftist movements has been one of the central reasons for the development of Latin American feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shayne|first1=Julie|title=Feminist Activism in Latin America, in The Encyclopedia of Sociology|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|pages=Vol no. 4: 1685–1689}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Latin American countries were able to attain legal rights for women in right, conservative contexts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barrig|first=Maruja|last2=Beckman|first2=Ericka|year=2001|title=Latin American Feminism|journal=NACLA Report on the Americas|volume=34|issue=5|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julie Shayne argues that there are 5 factors, which contributed to the emergence of revolutionary feminism: 1) experience in revolutionary movements showed challenge to status-quo perception of gender behaviour; 2) logistical trainings; 3) a political opening; 4) unmet basic needs by revolutionary movements; 5) a collective feminist consciousness.

== Evolution of feminism in Latin America ==

=== 1800s ===
Although the term feminist had not yet been used to describe women’s rights advocates until the 1890s, many women of the nineteenth century, mostly elite or middle class, tried to challenge dominant gender norms.

Born in Quito (now Ecuador), in 1797, Manuela Sáenz was a “precursor to feminism and women’s emancipation. History has both vilified and glorified Manuela Sáenz - for her affair with Simon Bolivar, and for accusations that say she only “manipulated gender norms to advance her person and political interests.” As an early supporter of the independence cause, she spied on Spanish royalty and held intellectual gatherings called ''tertulias''.

Juana Manuela Gorriti, an Argentinian journalist and writer born in 1818, advocated greater rights for women and wrote literary works with women protagonists that were both “romantic and political.” Similar to Sáenz, Gorriti held ''tertulias'' for literary men and women, one of whom included Clorinda Matto de Turner, a novelist sympathetic towards Indians and critical of the priesthood in Peru. Gorriti also worked with Teresa González, an avid writer who ran a girls’ school and advocated education for women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1900s-1920s ===
In the late half of the 19th century there were three main areas of feminists' discussions: [[suffrage]], protective labour laws, and access to education. 1910, Argentina — the first meeting of the organization of International Feminist Congresses (topic of equality). The second meeting was in 1916 in Mexico.

The 1910s saw many women, such as Aleida March, gain prominence during the revolutions of Mexico, Cuba, and Nicaragua. Additionally, Amelio Robles, born in 1889, was a notable man in a peasant army and the Confederation of Veterans of the Revolution who by modern United States standards would be considered a trans man.

A prominent international figure born during this time was Gabriela Mistral, who in 1945 won the Nobel prize in literature and became a voice for women in Latin America. She upheld conservative gender norms, even at one point saying, “perfect patriotism in women is perfect motherhood,” and that as a teacher she was “married” to the state. However, feminist theorists contend that her personal experiences contradict her language, because she never married, had a “mannish” appearance, and her close personal relationships with women suggest that she might have been a closet lesbian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1930s-1950s ===
The 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s were full of Latina feminists the pioneered the current Latin American Feminist movement. It was the beginning of the suffragist movement for many Latin American women. The first elected woman major of any major capital city in the Americas, Felisa Rincon de Gautier, was “an active participant in Puerto Rico's women's suffrage movement” that was won in 1932, and her child care programs “inspired the United States' Head Start program."  &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hamptoninstitution.org/latina-feminism.html#.V_xNteArl2x|title=Latina Feminism: National and Transnational Perspectives|last=Charleswell|first=Cherise|date=|year=2014|website=The Hampton Institute|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most women advocating for equal rights had to cling onto femininity to gain respect, but feminist theorist Julia de Burgos used her writings to “openly contest the prevailing notion that womanhood and motherhood are synonymous.” Additionally, Dr. Leila Gonzalez was involved in the “Brazilian Black movement” and helped develop “the practice of Black Feminism in Brazil.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== 1960s-1970s ===
At the end of 1960s, many Latin American females started forming groups of reflection and activism for defending women’s rights. Initially those women were from the middle class; a significant part came from the various left groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/07/1963-beginning-feminist-movement|title=Women 1963: 50 years on|last1=Cochrane|first1=Kira}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike their predecessors, Latin American feminists of the 1960s focused on social justice rather than suffrage. They emphasized “reproductive rights, equal pay in the job market, and equality of legal rights.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tobar|first=Ros|year=2003|title=Feminism is Socialism, Liberty, and Much More|journal=Journal of Women's History|volume=15|issue=3|pages=129–134|issn=1042-7961}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that this type of Latin American feminism was a result of Latina women’s activism against their position of sub-ordinance, not a reaction to women gaining more legal rights in the United States and Europe. As Gloria Anzaldúa said, we must put history “through a sieve, winnow out the lies, looks at the forces that we as a race, as women, have been part of.” &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Borderlands/La frontera: La nueva mestiza|last=Anzaldúa|first=Gloria|publisher=Aunt Lute Books|year=1999|isbn=|edition=Fourth|volume=1|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such female groups arose amid the sharp radicalization of class struggle in the continent, which resulted in labor and mass rising whose most evident manifestations were the Chilean industrial belts [[Cordón Industrial]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miranda|first1=Nicolás|title=Los cordones industriales, la revolución chilena y el frentepopulismo|url=http://www.rebelion.org/hemeroteca/chile/030904miranda.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cordobazo]] in Argentina (was a civil uprising in the city of Córdoba, Argentina, in the end of May 1969), student mobilizations in Mexico etc. These facts could be regarded as the sharpest experience and numerous movements of urban and rural guerrilla came to the scene.

It is for those reasons that Latin American feminist theorists, such as Ros Tobar, say that Chilean feminism is closely tied to socialism. Authoritarian regimes reinforced “the traditional family, and the dependent role of women, which is reduced to that of mother.” Dictatorships institutionalized social inequality, so many Latin American feminists tie authoritarian governments with less rights for women. Slogans, such as “Women give life, the dictatorships exterminates it,” “In the Day of the National Protest: Let’s make love not the beds,” and “Feminism is Liberty, Socialism, and Much More,” portrayed the demands of many Latin American feminists.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Latin American feminist theorist Nelly Richard of Chile explored how feminism and gay culture broke down rigid structures of life in Chile and was essential to the liberation of women in her novel ''Masculine/Feminine: Practices of Difference''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swarthout|first=Kelley|year=2009|title=Masculine/Feminine: Practices of Difference(s)|journal=RILCE.Revista de Filologa Hispnica|volume=25|issue=2|pages=442–444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There appeared feminist meetings (initially, every two years; later — every three years). They discussed recent accomplishments, strategies, possible future conflicts, ways to enhance their strategies and how to establish through such ways varied, rich and immense coordination between the national and transnational levels.

However, the mid-70s saw the decline of such movements due to the policy of [[neoliberalism]] in the region. Then came dictatorial regimes that settled over the majority of the continent and prevented the development of feminist movements, not only due to the establishment of a reactionary ideology based on the defense of tradition and family, but also due to the political persecution and state terrorism with its consequences such as torture, forced exile, imprisonment, disappearances and murders of political, social and trade union activists.
While the right wing of politicians considered feminists to be subversive and rebellious, the left, by contrast, named them as «small bourgeois».

It also was during this time that leftist feminist organizations gained attention for their efforts. This is most prominently seen in the “Women of Young Lords” of Puerto Rico. The Young Lords were at first'', Boricuan, Afro-Taino'' men who fought for basic human rights and “openly challenged machismo, sexism, and patriarchy.” Bianca Canales, Luisa Capetillo, Connie Cruz, and Denise Oliver became leaders in the Young Lords, and facilitated a “Ten-Point Health Program." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Most feminisms in Latin America arose out of the context of military dictatorships and masculine domination. However, a lot of marginalized women began questioning hegemonic feminism in the 1970s.  These women, whether they were Afro-descendant, lesbians, Indigenous, transgender, sex workers, domestic workers, etc., began to look at different, interlocking types of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duarte|first=ngela Ixkic Bastian|year=2012|title=From the Margins of Latin American Feminism: Indigenous and Lesbian Feminisms|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=38|pages=153–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gloria Anzaldúa, of Indigenous descent, described her experience with intersectionality as a “racial, ideological, cultural, and biological crosspollination” and called it a “new mestiza consciousness.”  &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Various critiques of “internal colonialism of Latin American states toward their own indigenous populations” and “Eurocentrism in the social sciences” emerged, giving rise to Latin American Feminist Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schutte|first=Ofelia|year=2011|title=Engaging Latin American Feminisms Today: Methods, Theory, Practice|journal=Hypatia|volume=26|issue=4|pages=783–803|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.2011.01200.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s ===

The feminist movement returned to be an important protagonist in the early 1980s after the fall of dictatorships and the establishment of the new democratic regimes throughout the region, with the dictatorship managing to interrupt the continuity with the previous stage.
Feminists of 1980s, e.g. Nancy Fraser, referring to violence against women, questioned the established limits of discussion and politicized problems which before had not ever been politicized, expanded their audiences, created new spaces and institutions in which the opposing interpretations could be developed and from where they could reach wider audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edited by Debra Castillo, Mary Jo Dudley and Breny Mendoza |title=Rethinking Feminisms in the Americas |url=http://lasp.einaudi.cornell.edu/system/files/feminisms%20book%20final.pdf |publisher=Latin American Studies Program Cornell University, Ithaca, NY |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615222549/http://lasp.einaudi.cornell.edu/system/files/feminisms%20book%20final.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the repressive period and particularly during the early years of democracy, human rights groups played a major role in the continent. These movements organized to denounce the torture, disappearances, and crimes of the dictatorship, were headed mainly by women (mothers, grandmothers and widowed). In order to understand the change in the language of feminist movements, it is necessary to bear in mind two things: the first is that it was women that headed revelations and subsequent struggle for the punishment of those who were responsible for the state terrorism, and the second is the policy-especially of the United States- to prioritize human rights in the international agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movimiento feminista en América latina|url=http://html.rincondelvago.com/movimiento-feminista-en-america-latina.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminists were able to achieve goals because of political parties, international organizations and local labour groups. Latin American feminist movements had two forms: as centers of feminist work, and as part of broad, informal, mobilized, volunteer, street feminist movement.
At the IV meeting in Mexico in 1987 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Espinosa Damián|first1=Gisela|title=Feminismo popular y feminismo indígena.  Abriendo brechas desde la subalternidad|url=http://www.labrys.net.br/labrys19/mexique/espinosa.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was signed a document on the myths of the feminist movement impeding its development. This document has a great impact; it states that feminism has a long way to go because, it is a radical transformation of society, politics and culture.
The myths that were listed are:
• Feminists are not interested in power
• Feminists do politics in a different way
• All feminists are the same
• There is a natural unity for the mere fact of being women
• Feminism exists only as a policy of women towards women
• The movement is a small group
• The women’s spaces ensure for themselves a positive space
• Personal is automatically political
• The consensus is democracy. This is important because each country in Latin America was able to push feminism in different ways – for example, through democracy, socialism, and even under authoritarian regimes (although this was less common).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

These myths were commonly disputed at Latin American and Caribbean meetings in the 1980s called ''Encuentros'', a space created to “strengthen feminist networks,” exchange analysis, and confront “conditions of oppression.” Though the ''Encuentros'' constructed a common space, the people there made sure it was a place of political dialogue, not of a sisterhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Elisabeth|title=Feminism Under Construction|journal=NACLA Report on the Americas|volume=47|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few points of unity found during these Encuentros was the effect colonialism and globalization had on their respective countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1990s ===

The neoliberal policies that began in the late 1980s and reached their peak in the continent during the decade of the 1990s, made the feminist movement fragmented and privatized. Many women began to work in multilateral organizations, finance agencies etc. and became bridges between financing bodies and female movements. It was around this time that many feminists, feeling discomfort with the current hegemonic feminism, began to create their own, autonomous organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1994, the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) became “a catalyst for indigenous women's organization in Mexico” and created “The Women's Revolutionary Law." Their example of indigenous feminism led the way for other indigenous tribes, such as the Mayans, Quechuas, and Quiches.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Zapatista women were made public in 1994. They are used as inspiration and symbolic tools to feminists throughout the world, and are often referred to in scholarly essays and articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1086/648538|title = The Emergence of Indigenous Feminism in Latin America|journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume = 35|issue = 3|pages = 539–545|year = 2010|last1 = Hernández Castillo|first1 = R. Aída}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, many feminists tried to bring together these autonomous organizations in Latin America and the Caribbean, which led to the Beijing Global Conference on Women of 1995.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Scholars argue that there is a strong correlation between the improvement of legal rights for Latin American women and the country’s struggle for democracy. For example, because of women’s active protests against President Abdala Bucaram’s government, Ecuador’s Constitution of 1998 saw many new legal rights for women. MUDE, or Women for Democracy, have stated that “what is not good for democracy is not good for women." However, this is not always the case. Peru had an authoritarian regime, but they had a quota for at least thirty percent of candidates in race to be women. It is important to note though, that the advance of Latin American women’s legal equality does not get rid of the social and economic inequality present.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Today===
The emergence of economic neoliberal models at the beginning of the 21st century led to a revival of the movement in the world, which was accompanied by an attempt of feminist dialogue with other social movements. A new feature is the feminist participation in global mobilization at different governments meetings and in multinational organizations where there is a discussion of the humanity’s future.

With the rise of globalization and international policies, many feminist political and academic organizations have been institutionalized. The more professional tactics of NGOs and political lobbying has given Latina feminists more influence on public policy, but at the cost of giving up “bolder, more innovative proposals from community initiatives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montenegro|first=Marisela|last2=Capdevila|first2=Rose|last3=Sarriera|first3=Heidi Figueroa|year=2012|title=Editorial introduction: Towards a transnational feminism: Dialogues on feminisms and psychologies in a Latin American context|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|volume=22|issue=2|pages=220–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current Latin American Feminist Groups include Ecuador’s Flor De Azaela, which started in 1982, making it the oldest movement for sex workers in Latin America. Many Afro-Indigenous women have also created organizations, such as the Fraternal Black Organization of Honduras, that advocate for more land rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://telesurtv.net|title=5 Latin American Feminist Groups You Should Know About|last=Deschamps|first=Marion|date=|website=teleSUR|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ''Colectivo Feminista Sexualidade Saude'' (CFSS ) of Brazil currently “provides health education for women and professionals,” where they encourage self-help and focus on “women's mental health, violence against women, and child mortality.” &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Today, there are also feminist groups that have spread to the United States. For example, [[The Latin Feminist Group|The Latina Feminist Group]] formed in the 1990s, composed by women from all places of Latin America. Although groups like these are local, they're all inclusive groups that accept members from all parts of Latin America. Members of the organizations are predominantly from European - Native American backgrounds with some members being completely descendants of Native American people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Telling To Live: Latina Feminist Testimonios|last=The Latina Feminist Group|first=|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0822327653|location=Durham|pages=3|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there is a weak relationship between lesbianism and feminism in Latin America. Since the 1960s, lesbians have become a viable group in Latin America. They have established groups to fight misogynist oppression against lesbians, fight AIDS in the LGBT community, and support one another. However, because of many military coups and dictatorships of Latin America, feminist lesbian groups have had to break up, reinvent, and reconstruct their work. Dictatorships in the 70s and 80s in Chile and Argentina were examples of the resistance to these feminist lesbians groups of Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Miñoso, Yuderkys Espinosa.

In the 2000s, Latin American feminist groups have set goals for their communities. Such goals call for the consolidation of a more organized LGBT community across Latin America. Other goals overall look to change smaller domestic policies that in any way discriminate to members of the LGBT community. They also aim to have more people on office, to network better with the broader Latin people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corrales|first=Javier|date=|title=LGBT Rights and Representation in Latin America and the Caribbean: The Influence of Structure, Movements, Institutions, and Culture|url=https://globalstudies.unc.edu/files/2015/04/LGBT_Report_LatAm_v8-copy.pdf|journal=The University of North Carolina Press|volume=|pages=4–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have set goals to advocate for LGBT rights in the political world, from organizations and political groups to acknowledge their rights, and encourage other countries to protect feminists and other members of the LGBT community in Latin America. Leaders such as Rafael de la Dehesa have contributed to describe early LGBT relations in parts of Latin America through his writings and advocacy. De la Dehesa, a Harvard alumni, has published books as, “Queering the Public Sphere in Mexico and Brazil: Sexual Rights Movements in Emerging Democracies” that advocate for a shift in popular culture that accepts queer Latinos.  His work, "Global Communities and Hybrid Cultures: Early Gay and Lesbian Electoral Activism in Brazil and Mexico" explains the gay communities and puts them in context to coincide with the history of those countries. Rafael has also introduced the idea of normalizing LGBT issues in patriarchal conservative societies such as Mexico and Brazil to suggest that being gay should no longer be considered taboo in the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Aguiar, José Carlos G.

== Indigenous Feminism in Latin America ==
There are many struggles that Latin American feminists face. For example, they have little to no political representation across all of Latin America. Not until the 2000s, have indigenous feminists leaders gained any political power. By 2006, Bolivia elected Evo Morales for president in 2006. Morales spearheaded a new movement in Bolivia, called the [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]]. This new movement had allowed for Indigenous working-class women to become members of parliament and serve for other branches of the government as well. This important transition of power was more peaceful and much more inclusive than any other country in Latin America. In other countries, obstacles remain for indigenous women to have any representation or political identity. The [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] women that live in Guatemala and parts of southern Mexico have struggled to gain any political mobility over the last few years due to immigration crises, economic and educational disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;Bastian Duarte, Ángela Ixkic. "From the Margins of Latin American Feminism: Indigenous and Lesbian Feminisms." ''Signs'' 38, no. 1 (2012): 153-78. doi:10.1086/665946.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revolutionary/Feminist mobilization ==
[[File:ERP combatants Perquín 1990 24.jpg|thumb|Men and Women both participated in revolutions that presented Revolutionary Feminism. These soldiers are fighting in the civil war in El Salvador.]]
Some experts, for example Julie Shayne, believe that in Latin America the phenomenon of female, feminism movements should be called «revolutionary feminism». Julie Shayne argues that a revolutionary feminism is one born of revolutionary mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shayne J.|title=The Revolution Question: Feminisms in El Salvador, Chile, and Cuba|date=2004|publisher=Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Julie Shayne was researching this phenomenon in El Salvador, in the 1980s, she came across Lety Mendez, a former member and head of the women’s secretariat of the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion. Lety Mendez, was at the forefront of the Salvadoran Civil War, and she knew from direct experience how necessary women are to any revolution. However, she believed women are completely forgotten about. Mendez explained that women were one of the sole reasons the Left had support and was able to move through El Salvador.&lt;ref name="Shayne, Julie D 2004"&gt;Shayne, Julie D. The Revolution Question: Feminisms in El Salvador, Chile, and Cuba. New Brunswick, New Jersey, and London: Rutgers University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=Sonia|date=Winter 1992|title=Feminisms in Latin America: From Bogota to San Bernardo|jstor=3174469|journal=The University of Chicago Press|volume=12|issue=2|pages=393–434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, Shayne traveled to Cuba and interviewed Maria Antonia Figueroa. Figeroa and her mother worked alongside Castro during the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. Figueroa also described an experience of women essentially carrying a revolution on their backs, but being undermined in the role they played in the revolution or not being to progress past the machismo and sexism, still rampant after their respective revolutions.&lt;ref name="Shayne, Julie D 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Alvarez, Sonia (Winter 1992). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3174469.pdf "Feminisms in Latin America: From Bogota to San Bernardo"] (PDF). ''The University of Chicago Press''. '''12''': 393–434.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of these women's’ feminist ideologies were born out of the needs they saw not being met for equality or simply completely disregarded after their countries’ revolutions or attempted revolutions. This feminism born out of the fight against oppressive regimes has given way to a new look of feminism that can be found throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name="Shayne, Julie D 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

The mobilization, or gathering, of feminists can be seen in Shaye’s research of Chilean women and their nation’s government organized mothers’ center. She witnessed that the gathering of these women and the sharing of their stories of oppression and domestic violence lead way to “Strategic (feminist) mobilization”. These gatherings were not only unique to Chile, but were throughout Latin America - Bogota, Colombia (1981), Lima, Perú (1983), Bertioga, Brazil (1985), Taxco, Mexico (1987), and San Bernardo, Argentina (1990) - through the 1980s known as Encuentros. These biannual meetings brought together grassroot and professional feminists that allowed these women to discuss their experiences and the progression of their countries.&lt;ref name="Shayne, Julie D 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

== Issues on agenda ==
Post-suffrage feminism in Latin America covers mainly three big streams: the feminist stream, the stream in political parties and the stream of women from political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vargas. V|title=The Feminist Movement in Latin America: Between Hope and Disenchantment. Development and Change|date=1992|pages=195–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues of great concern are: voluntary maternity/responsible paternity, divorce law reform, equal pay, personal autonomy, and challenging the consistently negative and sexist portrayal of women in the media; access to formal political representation, whereas women of the popular classes tend to focus their agendas on issues of economic survival and racial and ethnic justice.

In recent years, the Latin American feminists have also challenged [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] feminist frameworks, promoted literature and art by women of color, and establish their own social groups. They've also sought to challenge traditional nationalists who oppress women and use their political influence to subjugate non-heteosexuals, women, and people of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Telling to Live: Latina Feminist Testimonios|last=The Latina Feminist Group|first=|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0822327653|location=Durham|pages=4|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latin American feminist theory ==
Because feminist theory often relies on Western literary works rather than personal experiences, Latin American feminist theory is a construct that has appeared only recently in order to give Latina women legitimacy in Eurocentric contexts. Latin American feminist theorists have been known to not only get their sources from Western countries, but also from Latin American history, personal accounts, and research on the social sciences. There is a controversy, called “epistemic privilege,” as to how most Latina feminist philosophers enjoy cultural and economic privilege that distances them from the living conditions of the majority of Latin American women. Ophelia Schutte, a feminist philosopher, has argued that “feminist philosophy requires a home in a broader Latin American Feminist theory and not in the discipline of philosophy in Latin America.” &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu|title=Latin American Philosophy|last=Gracia|first=Jorge|last2=Vargas|first2=Manuel|date=|year=2013|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Latin America is vast, this type of feminist theory is diverse and hard to characterize. However, there are several notable Latin feminist theorists, many of which have already been mentioned in this article, like Ros Tobar, Ophelia Schutte, and Gloria Anzaldúa. Latin American feminist theorist Maria Lugones addressed ethnocentric racism, bilingualism, multiculturalism, and “interlinking registers of address.” Many Latina feminists borrow concepts that Lugones introduced, such as “the role of language, bodies, objects and places.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roelofs|first=Monique|year=2016|title=Navigating Frames of Address: María Lugones on Language, Bodies, Things, and Places|journal=Hypatia|language=English|publication-place=Hoboken|volume=31|issue=2|pages=370–387|doi=10.1111/hypa.12233|issn=0887-5367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graciela Hierro, born in 1928 in Mexico addressed “feminist ethics and the roles of feminism in public and academic spaces.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Freemen-on-the-land''' (also '''freemen-of-the-land''', the '''freemen movement''' or simply '''freemen''') are a loose group of individuals who believe that they are bound by [[statute law]]s only if they consent to those laws. They believe that they can therefore declare themselves independent of the government and the [[rule of law]], holding that the only "true" law is their own interpretation of "[[common law]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Freemen movement captures Canadian police attention |last=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/freemen-movement-captures-canadian-police-attention-1.1262159 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date= 29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief has been described as a [[conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Freemen of the dangerous nonsense|url = http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2011/11/15/freemen-of-the-dangerous-nonsense/|website = UK Human Rights Blog|accessdate = 9 December 2015|first = Adam|last = Wagner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freemen are active in [[English-speaking countries]]: the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, the United States, Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Stocked, [http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/the-seriously-weird-beliefs-of-freemen-on-the-land/news-story/cd91441f8f406a48457d5450b0a264f9 The seriously weird beliefs of Freemen on the land], ''[[news.com.au]]'', 9 July 2016.

In the Canadian court case ''Meads v. Meads'', [[Alberta Court of Queen's Bench]] Associate Chief Justice John D. Rooke used the phrase "Organised Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments" (OPCA) to describe the techniques and arguments used by freemen in court, describing them as frivolous and [[vexatious litigation|vexatious]].&lt;ref name="Wittmeier"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Edmonton+divorce+case+prompts+justice+dissect/7310855/story.html|title=Edmonton divorce case prompts justice to dissect "pseudolegal" arguments|last=Wittmeier|first=B|date=27 September 2012|work=[[Edmonton Journal]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003034131/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Edmonton+divorce+case+prompts+justice+dissect/7310855/story.html|archivedate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ablawg.ca/2012/10/30/the-organized-pseudolegal-commercial-argument-opca-litigant-case/ University of Calgary Faculty of Law]&lt;br&gt;- [http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/O/OrganizedPseudolegalCommercialArgumentLitigant.aspx Duhaime]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=meads-canlii /&gt; There is no recorded instance of freeman tactics being upheld in a court of law.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt |title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems |last1=Bizzle |first1=Legal |date=18 November 2011 |website=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt; In refuting each of the arguments used by Meads, Rooke concluded that "a decade of reported cases, many of which he refers to in his ruling, have failed to prove a single concept advanced by OPCA litigants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianlawyermag.com/4463/The-scourge-of-unrepresented-litigants.html ''Canadian Lawyer'' magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
Freemen believe that statute law is a contract, and that individuals can therefore opt out of statute law, choosing instead to live under what they call "common" (case) and "natural" laws. They believe natural laws require only that individuals do not harm others, do not damage the property of others, and do not use "fraud or mischief" in contracts. They say that all people have two parts to their existence: their body and their legal "person". The latter is represented by the individual's birth certificate; some freemen claim that it is entirely limited to the birth certificate. Under this theory, a "[[Strawman theory|strawman]]" is created when a birth certificate is issued, and this "strawman" is the entity who is subject to statutory law. The physical self is referred to by a slightly different name, such as "John of the family Smith" instead of "John Smith".&lt;ref name="Benchmark"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131216185721/http://judiciary.sut1.co.uk/docs/benchmark/benchmark_feb2012.pdf "Nonsense or loophole?"], ''Benchmark'', Issue 57, February 2012, p 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Many freemen beliefs are based on idiosyncratic interpretations of [[Admiralty law|admiralty or maritime law]], which the freemen claim govern the commercial world. These beliefs stem from fringe interpretations of various nautical-sounding words, such as ownership, citizenship, dock, or birth (berth) certificate. Freemen refer to the court as a "ship", the court's occupants as "passengers" and may claim that those leaving are "men overboard".&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen will try to claim common law (as opposed to admiralty law) jurisdiction by asking "Do you have a claim against me?" This, they contend, removes their consent to be governed by admiralty law and turns the court into a common law court, so that proceedings would have to go forward according to their version of common law. This procedure has never been successfully used.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen will often not accept legal representation, believing that to do so would mean contracting with the state. They believe that the United Kingdom and Canada are now operating in bankruptcy and are therefore under admiralty law. They believe that since the abolition of the gold standard, UK currency is backed not by gold but by the people (or the "legal fiction of their persons"). They describe persons as creditors of the UK corporation. Therefore, a court is a place of business, and a summons is an invitation to discuss the matter at hand, with no powers to require attendance or compliance.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt; They may believe that the government controls secret bank accounts in their name as part of this theory, which may be accessed to pay off debts.

None of the beliefs held by freemen have ever been supported by any judgments or verdicts in any criminal or civil court cases anywhere.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt; An [[England and Wales|English]] solicitor, writing anonymously, commented:

{{quote|[This] strategy might give lenders pause, of course, because litigating against awkward characters isn't much fun. But given how flimsy the freeman legal arguments are, the pause needn't be long. I've seen a transcript of a hearing in which a debtor tried to rely on the freeman defence. It was over as soon as the judge asked (I can imagine the withering tone), ''"Are you planning to persist in this defence, Mr Jones?"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anonymous|title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt|website=The Guardian|accessdate=20 June 2015}} Note: Author name withheld by request; a solicitor of England and Wales; wrote with permission pseudonymously as "Legal Bizzle"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Contracts ==
Freemen believe that since they exist in a common law [[jurisdiction]] where equality is paramount and mandatory, the people in the government and courts are not above the law, and that government and court personnel therefore must obtain the [[consent of the governed]]. Freemen believe that government employees who do not obtain consent of the governed have abandoned the rule of law. They believe this consent is routinely secured by way of people submitting applications and through acts of registration. They believe the public servants have deceived the population into abandoning their status as freemen in exchange for the status of a "child of the province" or "ward of the state", allowing those children to collect benefits such as welfare, unemployment insurance, and pension plans or old age security.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Freemen believe that the government has to establish "joinder" to link oneself and one's legal person. If one is asked whether one is "John Smith" and one says that is so, one has established joinder and connected the physical and human persons. The next step is to obtain consent. Statutes are merely invitations to enter a contract, and are only legally enforceable if one enters into the contract consensually. Otherwise, statute laws are not applicable. Freemen believe that the government is constantly trying to trick people into entering into a contract with them, so they often return bills, notices, summons and so on with the message "No contract—return to sender".&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

A "notice of understanding and intent and claim of right" is a document used by freemen to declare their sovereignty. The signed document, often [[notarised]], is sent to the Queen and possibly other authorities such as the Prime Minister and police chiefs. It usually begins with the words "Whereas it is my understanding" and goes on to state their understanding of the law and their lack of consent to it.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen's beliefs are based on misunderstandings and wishful thinking and have not been successful in any courts anywhere.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

== Court cases ==
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Meads v. Meads]] --&gt;
*Dennis Larry Meads of [[Edmonton]], Alberta, stormed out of a hearing in the [[Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta]] on 8 June 2012, related to his divorce and matrimonial property case. In response, Associate Chief Justice John D. Rooke wrote a lengthy and comprehensive 185-page judgment rejecting various freemen claims, grouping them with other pseudolegal arguments as "Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments" (OPCA), specifically, in this case, Meads' freeman on the land claims, arguments and documents, saying that:&lt;ref name="Wittmeier" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The bluntly idiotic substance of Mr. Mead's argument explains the unnecessarily complicated manner in which it was presented. OPCA arguments are never sold to their customers as simple ideas, but instead are byzantine schemes which more closely resemble the plot of a dark fantasy novel than anything else. Latin maxims and powerful sounding language are often used. Documents are often ornamented with many strange markings and seals. Litigants engage in peculiar, ritual‑like in court conduct. All these features appear necessary for gurus to market OPCA schemes to their often desperate, ill‑informed, mentally disturbed, or legally abusive customers. This is crucial to understand the non-substance of any OPCA concept or strategy. The story and process of a OPCA scheme is not intended to impress or convince the Courts, ''but rather to impress the guru's customer''.&lt;ref name="meads-canlii"&gt;''[http://canlii.ca/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html Meads v.

:In a subsequent ruling on another OPCA case, ''Gauthier v. Starr 2016 ABQB 213'', Justice Rooke noted that, following the ruling, Meads had abandoned OPCA strategies and concluded the litigation in an orderly fashion.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.is/20160419203650/http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2016/2016abqb213/2016abqb213.html Gauthier v Starr, 2016 ABQB 213]''  (CanLII), Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, 14 April 2016, para. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
* Elizabeth Watson came to public attention in 2011 as a self-styled legal adviser for Victoria Haigh in a (child) custody case; she was given a nine-month [[prison sentence]] for [[contempt of court]] (later suspended). She had defaced court documents by writing the words "no contract" and otherwise refused to accept or acknowledge the authority of a court of law, by amongst other things refusing to respond to the written legal notices or other correspondences from the court, and styled and addressed herself and Haigh in the irregular fashion as "Elizabeth of the Watson family" and "Victoria of the Haigh family" respectively, instead of their names in the normal and usual mode of rendering.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2011/B15.html# Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council and Elizabeth Watson and Victoria Haigh]'', Royal Courts of Justice, 22 August 2011, [2011] 3 FCR 422, [2011] Fam Law 1194, [2011] EWHC B15 (Fam)&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/local/investigator_jailed_for_report_as_court_contempt_compromised_well_being_of_child_1_3706219# "‘Investigator’ jailed for report as court contempt compromised well-being of child"], ''The Star'' (Sheffield), 24 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mark Bond of [[Norfolk]], England, was arrested in 2010 for non-payment of tax, despite handing police a "notice of intent" stating that he was no longer a UK citizen. He told police that the notice had already been delivered to the Queen and the prime minister. He told the ''[[Norwich Evening News]]'', "Today I asked the judge to walk into the court under common law and not commercial law. If I had entered under commercial law it would prove that I accepted its law. I was denied my rights to go in there." He was sentenced to three months custody, suspended on condition that he pay off the debt at £20 a week.&lt;ref&gt;David Bale, [http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/news/norfolk_tax_dodger_arrested_after_writing_to_queen_1_745681 "Norfolk tax dodger arrested... after writing to Queen"], ''Norwich Evening News'', 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bobby Sludds appeared in court in [[County Wexford]] in Ireland, charged with various motoring offences including two counts of no insurance. Before the police began to give evidence, the accused handed in a letter stating he was not Mr. Sludds but Bobby of the family Sludds and questioning the use of the word 'person' in the charge. He was given two suspended sentences and a fine of €670. (He had 24 previous convictions for motoring offences.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wexfordpeople.ie/news/bobby-of-the-family-sludds-may-be-jailed-2878029.html "'Bobby of the family Sludds' may be jailed"], ''Wexford People'', 14 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wilfred Keith Thompson and two others were arrested by police in [[Guelph]], Ontario, Canada, charged with breaking, entering and theft as well as firearms offences. Thompson had previously made headlines for informing City Hall, local police, Guelph MP [[Frank Valeriote]], Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] and other officials he is "an autonomous being not controlled by others". One of his co-defendants, Trevor "Red" De Block, refused to identify himself to the court, though it was said that his criminal mug shot, computer records, tattoos and other information confirmed his identity. "I object," De Block said, adding that he was not the "rightful owner" of his name, but refusing to clarify or participate in legal proceedings. "I don't bow down to bail .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. to false gods," he said, and rejected assistance from the appointed lawyer. Thompson and De Block were denied bail.&lt;ref&gt;Vik Kirsch, [https://www.guelphmercury.com/news-story/2778969-security-tight-as-suspects-in-guelph-break-in-case-appear-in-bail-court/ "Security tight as suspects in Guelph break-in case appear in bail court"], ''Guelph Mercury'', 5 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dean Marshall of [[Preston, East Riding of Yorkshire|Preston]], [[Holderness]], near [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Yorkshire]], England, was taken to court after he was found to be growing 26 [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] plants in his garden shed. Claiming he was a freeman on the land and therefore not guilty, he then attempted to call up [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and (the prime minister) [[David Cameron]] as his witnesses, although he was told that neither was available to attend. A jury at Hull [[Crown Court]] dismissed his claims and convicted him of conspiracy to produce cannabis for which he was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended upon entering into a good behaviour bond for two years, and was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Cannabis-grower-tried-Queen-Prime-Minister/story-16717687-detail/story.html "Cannabis-grower tried to call Queen and Prime Minister as witnesses in 'bizarre' trial"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817235748/http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Cannabis-grower-tried-Queen-Prime-Minister/story-16717687-detail/story.html |date=17 August 2012 }}, ''Hull Daily Mail'', 16 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Doug Jones of [[Pembroke Dock]], Pembrokeshire, Wales, spent 22 days in prison after refusing to take a breath test. Jones questioned the authority and jurisdiction of the court, asking to see the judge's 'Oath of Office' which resulted in a sentence of fourteen days for [[contempt of court]]. He was sentenced to a further seven days after failing to attend a second hearing, but pleaded guilty to the original charges, receiving [[List of UK driving licence endorsements|an endorsement on his driving licence]]. His interest in the freemen on the land movement started after watching documentaries on conspiracy theories surrounding the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London bombings]].  His solicitor, Phillipa Ashworth, stated "On this occasion, in hindsight he appreciates it was not the time to test out philosophical theories behind this approach to life, and in hindsight it isn't something he would do again."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/9918044.Jail_for_man_who_refused__to_be_governed_/?ref=rss "Magna Carta beliefs lead to 22 days jail for Pembrokeshire businessman who refused 'to be governed'"], ''Western Telegraph'', 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gavin Kaylhem of [[Grimsby]], [[North East Lincolnshire]], England, wilfully refused to pay his [[council tax]] debts of £1,268.54 accrued between 2001 and 2008 and was sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. He had claimed that he was a "freeman" and thus had no contractual duty under common law to pay. He refused to co-operate with [[Magistrates of England and Wales|magistrates]]' questions.&lt;ref&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council, [http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/news/2011/dec/council-tax-evader-jailed-30-days/ "Council tax evader jailed for 30 days"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211022928/http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/news/2011/dec/council-tax-evader-jailed-30-days/ |date=11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mandeep Sandhu of [[Tividale]], [[Sandwell]], West Midlands, was stopped by police while driving a car that was insured to a woman. He refused to give his details to the officers, saying that to do so would mean "entering into a contract he could not afford to fulfil". He refused to co-operate at the police station and when brought before Sandwell Magistrates' Court, in October 2015, Sandhu was convicted of driving without insurance and obstructing police and was also found in contempt of court. He was sentenced to 14 days in prison for the contempt, and ordered to pay £330 in fines for the insurance charge with court costs and had 6 points added to his licence. A spokesperson for West Midlands Police said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/freeman-land-driver-jailed-contempt-10253089|title='Freeman-of-the-Land' driver jailed for contempt of court|work=The Birmingham Mail|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;- {{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2015/10/13/freeman-driver-who-refused-to-talk-to-police-jailed/|title='Freeman' driver who refused to talk to police jailed|work=Express &amp; Star|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole process meant that a simple matter of driving without insurance took up hours of police time – and ultimately a stint behind bars after being convicted of contempt of court while defending himself. We hope this case acts as a warning that to obstruct the police and the courts is not a wise move.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Errol Denton, a [[live blood analysis]] practitioner, was charged with offences under the [[Cancer Act 1939]]. At Westminster Magistrates' Court, he used a freeman defence. Since both the prosecution and the defence were rare, it was reported in the press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/freeman-on-the-land-causes-chaos-in-court-1-3715573 "‘Freeman on the land’ causes chaos in court"], ''Edinburgh Evening News'', 11 March 2015&lt;br /&gt;- [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10510345/Harley-Street-practitioner-claimed-he-could-cure-cancer-and-HIV-with-lifestyle-changes-and-herbs-court-hears.html "Harley Street practitioner claimed he could cure cancer and HIV with lifestyle changes and herbs, court hears"], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 11 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2014 he was convicted on all nine counts and fined £9,000 plus around £10,000 in costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/10732023/Duped-by-the-blood-analyst-who-says-he-can-cure-cancer.html |title=Duped by the 'blood analyst' who says he can cure cancer |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=30 March 2014 |first=Robert |last=Mendick |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402094151/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/10732023/Duped-by-the-blood-analyst-who-says-he-can-cure-cancer.html |archivedate=2 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;br&gt;- [https://web.archive.org/web/20140321025146/http://www.edp24.co.uk/mobile/news/crime/woodford_green_harley_street_worker_handed_19k_court_bill_after_claiming_he_could_cure_cancer_and_hiv_with_lifestyle_changes_1_3459178 "Woodford Green Harley Street worker handed 19k court bill after claiming he could cure cancer and HIV with lifestyle change"], ''Eastern Daily Press'', 20 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advice to professionals ==
Lawyers and notaries in [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]], Canada, have been warned by their professional bodies about dealing with freemen as clients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calgarysun.com/2013/09/28/law-society-of-alberta-issues-warning-to-lawyers-after-bizarre-calgary-freeman-on-the-land-case-resolved/ "Law Society of Alberta issues warning to lawyers after bizarre Calgary 'Freeman on the Land" case resolved"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417062013/http://www.calgarysun.com/2013/09/28/law-society-of-alberta-issues-warning-to-lawyers-after-bizarre-calgary-freeman-on-the-land-case-resolved/ |date=17 April 2015 }}, ''Calgary Sun'', 28 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, lawyers have been advised to be careful not to stamp or notarise the pseudo-legal documents that freemen typically use, so as not to create a perception of authority for such documents.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Society of British Columbia: [http://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/page.cfm?cid=2627 ''Practice Tips: The Freeman-on-the-Land movement''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417061546/http://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/page.cfm?cid=2627 |date=17 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. police, both speaking personally and as official guidance, have provided advice to law enforcement on dealing with the similar [[sovereign citizen movement]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5959">'''Frege's puzzles''' are puzzles about the [[semantics]] of [[proper name]]s, although related puzzles also arise in the case of [[indexical]]s. [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925) introduced the puzzle at the beginning of his article "Über Sinn und Bedeutung" ("[[On Sense and Reference]]") in 1892 in one of the most influential articles in [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophy of language]].

==The puzzles ==

The term "Frege's puzzle" is commonly applied to two related problems.  One is a problem about identity statements that Frege raised at the beginning of "On Sense and Reference", and another concerns propositional attitude reports.&lt;ref&gt;Zalta, Edward N., "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/frege/ Gottlob Frege]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Fall 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  For the first problem, consider the following two sentences:

(1) [[Hesperus]] is Hesperus.

(2) Hesperus is [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]].

Each of these sentences is true, since 'Hesperus' refers to the same object as 'Phosphorus' (the planet Venus). Nonetheless, (1) and (2) seem to differ in their meaning or what Frege called "cognitive value". (1) is just a truth of logic that can be known [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]], whereas (2) records an empirical truth that was discovered by astronomers. The problem, however, is that proper names are often taken to have no meaning beyond their reference (a view often associated with [[John Stuart Mill]]). But this seems to imply that the two statements mean the same thing, or have the same cognitive value.&lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2017). Lexemes, practs, and those who have yet to decide. Linguistik Online, 81, 77-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2018). Which view of indirect reports do Persian data corroborate? International Review of Pragmatics, 10(1), 76-100. &lt;/ref&gt;

Frege proposed to resolve this puzzle by postulating a second level of meaning besides reference in the form of what he called [[Sense and reference|sense]]: a difference in the mode of presentation or the way an object can be "given" to us.  Thus 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' have the same reference, but differ in sense because they present Venus in different ways.

The second puzzle concerns [[propositional attitude]] reports, such as belief reports.  Ordinarily, coreferring names are substitutable [[salva veritate]], that is, without change in truth value.  For example, if 'Hesperus is bright' is true then 'Phosphorus is bright' is also true given that 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' refer to the same planet.  But now consider the following argument:

(3) Alex believes Hesperus is visible in the evening.

(4) Hesperus = Phosphorus.

(5) Alex believes Phosphorus is visible in the evening.

This argument appears to be [[Validity (logic)|invalid]]: even if (3) and (4) are true, (5) could be false.  If Alex is not aware that Hesperus and Phosphorus are the same planet, then it seems that he could believe that Hesperus is visible in the evening while rejecting the claim that Phosphorus is visible in the evening (perhaps he thinks Phosphorus, the morning star, is only visible in the morning).  The principle that coreferring names are substitutable ''salva veritate'' thus appears to fail in the context of belief reports (and similarly for other propositional attitude reports).

Frege again proposed to solve this problem by appeal to his distinction between sense and reference.  In particular, he held that when a proper name occurs in the context of an attitude report, its reference shifts to its ordinary sense: thus 'Phosphorus', for example, denotes the planet Venus when it occurs in the sentence 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' or in an identity sentence like (4), but when it occurs embedded in an attitude report like (5) it denotes its ordinary ''sense.''

==New theories of reference and the return of Frege's puzzle==

Frege's puzzle has received a great deal of attention since the attacks on the [[descriptivist theory of names]] mounted in the 1970s and 1980s by philosophers such as [[Keith Donnellan]], [[Saul Kripke]], [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]].&lt;ref&gt;Cumming, S. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/names/ Names]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of these attacks on descriptivism, many philosophers embraced the Millian or direct-reference view of proper names, according to which the meaning of a name is simply its referent. As noted above, this Millian view has the result that (1) and (2) express the same proposition.  Similarly, the embedded sentences 'Hesperus is visible in the evening' and 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' from (3) and (5) express the same proposition.  It therefore looks like (3) and (5) cannot differ in truth value since they attribute belief in one and the same proposition.

In view of this problem, many philosophers of language have attempted to work out a solution to the puzzle within the confines of direct-reference theories of proper names. Some of these philosophers include [[Nathan Salmon]] (e.g. in ''Frege's puzzle'' and ''Content, Cognition, and Communication''), [[Howard Wettstein]] (e.g. in "Has Semantics Rested on a Mistake?"), [[Scott Soames]], [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]], [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] (e.g. in ''Reference and Reflexivity''), and [[Joseph Almog]].

The '''Great Transition''' is a term used by the Great Transition Initiative and its predecessor, the [[Global Scenario Group]] (GSG), to describe a vision of a just and sustainable global future. The term was originally coined by [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] in ''The Meaning of the 20th Century – The Great Transition'' (1964) and describes the shift from [[Pre-Modern|pre-modern]] to post-modern culture, and the four possible courses of action that these organizations believe will allow humanity to successfully manage the Great Transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=u8YSAAAACAAJ}}|title=The Meaning of the 20th Century: The Great Transition|last=Boulding|first=Kenneth Ewart|publisher=University Press of America|year=1988|isbn=978-0-8191-7102-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elements of the Great Transition vision include egalitarian social and ecological values, increased inter-human connectivity, improved [[quality of life]], and a healthy planet, as well as the absence of poverty, war and environmental destruction. The Great Transition concept was cited by [[List of Prime Ministers of Bhutan|Prime Minister of Bhutan]] [[Jigme Thinley]],&lt;ref&gt;Jigme Thinly, [http://www.cabinet.gov.bt/?page_id=207 "Address by the Prime Minister on Well-Being and Happiness,"] UN Headquarters, New York, April 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Josh Ryan-Collins of the [[New Economics Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;Josh Ryan-Collins, [http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/entry/the-great-transition ''Great Transition''] (London: New Economics Foundation, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Capital Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisymposium.com/ The Capital Institute Symposium: "Beyond Sustainability: The Road to Regenerative Capitalism] New York, June 20–21, 2013, &lt;/ref&gt; It was used as a theme for the 2011 SmartCSOs conference on strategies for Civil Society Organisations in London.&lt;ref&gt;SmartCSOs, [http://www.veblen-institute.org/Effective-change-strategies-for ''Effective Change Strategies for the Great Transition: Five Leverage Points for Civil Society Organisations''] Berlin: Smart CSOs, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Great Transition was first introduced by the [[Global Scenario Group]] (GSG), an international body of scientists convened in 1995 by the [[Tellus Institute]] and [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] to examine the requirements for a transition to a sustainable global society. The GSG set out to describe and analyze scenarios for the future of the earth as it entered a [[planetary phase of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.gsg.org/gsgpub.html and Paul Raskin, Tariq Banuri, Gilberto Gallopín, Pablo Gutman, Al Hammond, Robert Kates, and Rob Swart, [http://www.greattransition.org/gt-essay ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead''] (Boston: Stockholm Environment Institute, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Transition Initiative==

Further development of Great Transition scenarios is carried on by the [[Great Transition Initiative]] (GTI). Launched in 2003, GTI is a global network of several hundred scholars, intellectuals, civil society leaders, and activists working to develop visions and pathways for a “Great Transition" to a future of equity, solidarity and ecological sustainability. The Initiative was relaunched as an online journal and discussion network in 2014.

'''Jason Anderson''' (born 17 February 1979) is a former [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] cricketer. A right-handed [[wicket-keeper]]/[[batsman]], Anderson represented the [[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermudian national side]] between 2010 and 2013, most notably at the [[2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Two|2011 World Cricket League Division Two]] tournament and the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier|2012 World Twenty20 Qualifier]].

Having earlier played for [[Bermuda national under-19 cricket team|the national under-19 team]], Anderson made his senior debut for Bermuda in September 2010, at a cricket festival in Canada.&lt;ref name="misc"&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/161/161401/Miscellaneous_Matches.html Miscellaneous matches played by Jason Anderson] – CricketArchive.

== History ==
Kuro Tawil was on a [[backpacking (travel)|solo-backpacking]] trip through [[Southwestern Asia|South Western Asia]] in 2013, shortly after graduating from [[Texas State University]]. While traveling, he realized how large the issue of [[sexual violence]] is around the world and saw how in many developing countries the [[law]] and [[justice system]] were ineffective. Tawil realized many of these women needed a way to take their protection and their lives into their own hands, seeing the need for a realistic way for a woman to be able to defend themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kuro-tawil/fighting-the-war-on-women_1_b_5419285.html|title=Fighting the War on Women: Arming Women to Fight Sexual Assault Worldwide|last=Tawil|first=Kuro|date=2014-06-02|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tawil returned home to Texas and started the [[conscious business]] Kuros, as a way to fund the distribution of pepper spray to [[Sexual violence|at risk populations of women]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.policeone.com/police-products/less-lethal/sprays-aerosols/press-releases/8560308-New-Pepper-Spray-from-SABRE-and-Kuros-Helps-Women-Worldwide/|title=New Pepper Spray from SABRE and Kuros!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47176">'''Lean construction''' is a combination of operational research and practical development in design and construction with an adaption of [[lean manufacturing]] principles and practices to the end-to-end design and construction process.  Unlike manufacturing, construction is a project-based production process. Lean construction is concerned with the alignment and holistic pursuit of concurrent and continuous improvements in all dimensions of the built and natural environment: design, construction, activation, maintenance, salvaging, and recycling (Abdelhamid 2007, Abdelhamid et al. 2008).  This approach tries to manage and improve construction processes with minimum cost and maximum value by considering customer needs (Koskela et al. 2002&lt;ref name = koskela-et-al-2002 /&gt;).

The term ''lean construction'' was coined by the [[International Group for Lean Construction]] in its first meeting in 1993 (Gleeson et al. 2007). ''Construction'' in ''Lean Construction'' refers to the entire industry and not the phase during which construction takes place.  Thus, Lean Construction is for owners, architects, designers, engineering, constructors, suppliers &amp; end users.

==Historical development==
Lauri Koskela, in 1992, challenged the [[construction management]] community to consider the inadequacies of the time-cost-quality tradeoff paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leanconstruction.org/pdf/Koskela-TR72.pdf Koskela-TR72] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030413063103/http://www.leanconstruction.org/pdf/Koskela-TR72.pdf |date=2003-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another paradigm-breaking anomaly was that observed by Ballard (1994&lt;ref name = ballard-1994&gt;{{cite conference | last = Ballard| first = Glenn | title= The Last Planner | booktitle = Northern California Construction Institute Spring Conference | date = 22–24 April 1994 | location = Monterey, CA | url = http://www.leanconstruction.org/pdf/LastPlanner.pdf | format = pdf | pages =  | publisher= Lean Construction Institute | accessdate = 31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Ballard and Howell (1994a&lt;ref name = ballard-howell-1994a&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Ballard | first1 = Glenn | last2 = Howell | first2 = Gregory | title= Implementing Lean Construction: Stabilizing Work Flow | booktitle = Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Meeting of the International Group for Lean Construction | date = September 1994 | location = Santiago, Chile | url = http://www.leanconstruction.org/media/docs/stabilizingworkflow.pdf | format = pdf | pages = 101–110 | publisher= | accessdate = 17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1994b), and Howell (1998).  Analysis of project plan failures indicated that "normally only about 50% of the tasks on weekly work plans are completed by the end of the plan week" and that constructors could mitigate most of the problems through "active management of variability, starting with the structuring of the project (temporary production system) and continuing through its operation and improvement," (Ballard and Howell 2003&lt;ref name = ballard-and-howell-2003&gt;{{cite conference | last1= Ballard| first1= Glenn | last2= Howell | first2= Gregory | title= Competing Construction Management Paradigms| booktitle = Proceedings of the 2003 ASCE Construction Research Congress | date = 19–21 March 2003 | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | url = http://www.leanconstruction.org/lcj/LCJ_04_0008.pdf | format = pdf | pages = | accessdate = 31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Evidence from research and observations indicated that the conceptual models of Construction Management and the tools it utilizes ([[work breakdown structure]], [[critical path method]], and [[earned value management]]) fail to deliver projects 'on-time, at budget, and at desired quality' (Abdelhamid 2004).  With recurring negative experiences on projects, evidenced by endemic quality problems and rising litigation, it became evident that the governing principles of construction management needed revisiting. One comment published by the [[Construction Management Association of America|CMAA]], in its ''Sixth Annual Survey of Owners'' (2006), pointed to concern about work methods and the cost of waste: &lt;blockquote&gt;"While the cost of steel and cement are making headlines, the less publicized failures in the management of construction projects can be disastrous. Listen carefully to the message in this comment. We are not talking about just materials, methods, equipment, or contract documents. We are talking about how we work to deliver successful capital projects and how we manage the costs of inefficiency."&lt;ref name = sixth-annual-survey&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | title = Sixth Annual Survey of Owners | url = http://www.cmaafoundation.org/files/surveys/2005-survey.pdf | author = FMI/CMAA | publisher = Construction Management Association of America | accessdate = 31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===A new paradigm===
Koskela (2000)&lt;ref name = koskela-thesis/&gt; argued that the mismatch between the conceptual models and observed reality underscored the lack of robustness in the existing constructs and signaled the need for a theory of production in construction. Koskela then used the ideal production system embodied in the [[Toyota Production System]] to develop a more overarching production management paradigm for project-based production systems where production is conceptualized in three complementary ways, namely, as a Transformation (T), as a Flow (F), and as Value generation (V).
: '''Transformation''' is the production of inputs into outputs.&lt;ref name = koskela-thesis/&gt;

: '''Flow''' can be defined as "Movement that is smooth and uninterrupted, as in the 'flow of work from one crew to the next' or the flow of value at the Pull of the customer."&lt;ref name = lci-glossary/&gt;

: '''Value''' is "What the Customer is actually paying for the project to produce and install."&lt;ref name = lci-glossary&gt;[http://www.leanconstruction.org/glossary.htm LCI Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Koskela and Howell (2002) also presented a review of existing management theory – specifically as related to the planning, execution, and control paradigms – in project-based production systems. Both conceptualizations provide a solid intellectual foundation of lean construction as evident from both research and practice (Abdelhamid 2004).

Recognizing that construction sites reflect prototypical behavior of complex and chaotic systems, especially in the flow of both material and information on and off site, Bertelsen (2003a and 2003b) suggested that construction should be modeled using chaos and complex systems theory.
Bertelsen (2003b) specifically argued that construction could and should be understood in three complimentary ways:
* As a project-based production process
* As an industry that provides autonomous agents
* As a social system

==What is lean construction?==
Lean construction is a “way to design production systems to minimize waste of materials, time, and effort in order to generate the maximum possible amount of value," (Koskela et al. 2002&lt;ref name = koskela-et-al-2002&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Koskela | first1 =L.
 | last2 =Howell | first2 = G.
 | last3 =Ballard | first3 =G.
 | last4 =Tommelein | first4 =I. | author-link = | author2-link = | chapter = Foundations of Lean Construction | title = Design and Construction: Building in Value | editor1-last = Best | editor1-first = Rick | editor2-last = de Valence | editor2-first = Gerard | place = Oxford, UK | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann, Elsevier | year = 2002 | month= | edition = | chapterurl = | url = | doi = | isbn = 0750651490}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Designing a production system to achieve the stated ends is only possible through the collaboration of all project participants (Owner, A/E, contractors, Facility Managers, End-user) at early stages of the project.  This goes beyond the contractual arrangement of design/build or constructability reviews where contractors, and sometime facility managers, merely react to designs instead of informing and influencing the design (Abdelhamid et al. 2008).

Lean construction recognizes that desired ends affect the means to achieve these ends, and that available means will affect realized ends (Lichtig 2004).  Essentially, lean construction aims to embody the benefits of the Master Builder concept (Abdelhamid et al. 2008).

"One can think of lean construction in a way similar to [[mesoeconomics]]. Lean construction draws upon the principles of project-level management and upon the principles that govern production-level management. Lean construction recognizes that any successful project undertaking will inevitably involve the interaction between project and production management." (Abdelhamid 2007)

Lean construction supplements traditional construction management approaches with (Abdelhamid 2007): (1) two critical and necessary dimensions for successful capital project delivery by requiring the deliberate consideration of material and information flow and value generation in a production system; and (2) different project and production management (planning-execution-control) paradigms.

While lean construction is identical to lean production in spirit, it is different in how it was conceived as well as how it is practiced. There is a view that "adaptation" of Lean Manufacturing/Production forms the basis of Lean Construction.  The view of Lauri Koskela, Greg Howell, and Glenn Ballard is very different, with the origin of lean construction arising mainly from the need for a production theory in construction and anomalies that were observed in the reliability of weekly [[production planning]].

Getting work to flow reliably and predictably on a construction site requires the impeccable alignment of the entire supply chain responsible for constructed facilities such that value is maximized and waste is minimized.  With such a broad scope, it is fair to say that tools found in Lean Manufacturing and Lean Production, as practiced by Toyota and others, have been adapted to be used in the fulfillment of Lean construction principles. TQM, [[Statistical process control|SPC]], six-sigma, have all found their way into lean construction. Similarly, tools and methods found in other areas, such as in social science and business, are used where they are applicable. The tools and methods in construction management, such as CPM and work breakdown structure, etc., are also utilized in lean construction implementations. The three unique tools and methods that were specifically conceived for lean construction are the Last Planner System, Target Value Design, and the Lean Project Delivery System.

If the tool, method, and/or technique will assist in fulfilling the aims of lean construction, it is considered a part of the toolkit available for use.  A sampling of these tools includes: [[Building information modeling|BIM]] (Lean Design), A3, process design (Lean Design), offsite fabrication and [[Just in time (business)|JIT]] (Lean Supply), [[Value stream mapping|value chain mapping]] (Lean Assembly), visual site (Lean Assembly); [[5S (methodology)|5S]] (Lean Assembly), daily crew [[Stand-up meeting|huddles]] (Lean Assembly).

The priority for all construction work is to:
# Keep work flowing so that the crews are always productive installing product
# Reduce inventory of material and tools and

While lean construction’s main tool for making design and construction processes more predictable is the '''Last Planner System''' ([[#Last_Planner_System|see below]]) and derivatives of it, other lean tools already proven in manufacturing have been adapted to the construction industry with equal success.

==Early involvement of contractors and suppliers==
The early involvement of contractors and suppliers is seen as a key differentiator for construction so called 'best practice'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 2004 | last = Cain | first = Clive | title = Profitable partnering for lean construction | isbn = 1405110864 | location = Oxford, UK | publisher = Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are Trade Marked business processes (see below), academics have also addressed related concepts such as 'early contractor involvement' (ECI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Walker | first1 = D.H.T | last2 = Lloyd-Walker | first2 = B | title = Understanding Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) procurement forms | editor-last =  Smith | editor-first = S | conference  = Procs 28th Annual ARCOM Conference | date = 3–5 September 2012 | url = http://www.arcom.ac.uk/-docs/proceedings/ar2012-0877-0887_Walker_Lloyd-Walker.pdf | location =  Edinburgh, UK | publisher = Association of Researchers in Construction Management | pages = 877–887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrated Project Delivery===
 Primary IPD team members include the owner, architect, key technical consultants, general contractor and key subcontractors.{{citation needed | date = July 2013}}

Using IPD, project participants can overcome key organizational and contractual problems. The IPD approach to contracting aligns project objectives with the interests of key participants. IPD relies on participant selection, transparency and continuing dialog. Construction consumers might consider rethinking their contracting strategies to share more fully in the benefits. The IPD approach creates an organization with the ability to apply [[Lean Project Delivery]] (LPD) principles and practices. (Matthews and Howell 2005&lt;ref name = matthews-and-howell-2005&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://www.leanconstruction.org/lcj/V2_N1/LCJ_05_003.pdf |date=April 2005 | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | last1= Matthews | first1= Owen | last2= Howell | first2= Gregory A. | title= Integrated Project Delivery An Example Of Relational Contracting | journal= Lean Construction | location= | pages= 46–61 | format= pdf | issn= 1555-1369 | accessdate= 29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Commercial arrangements that support IPD and Lean Project Delivery===
There are at least five principal forms of contract that support lean construction
* In America, '''IFoA'''&lt;ref name = lichtig-2005 /&gt; uses explicit lean construction principles. [[Sutter Health]] in Sacramento developed 'Integrated Form of Agreement for Lean Project Delivery' for use on healthcare projects in and around California.{{citation needed | date = March 2013}}
* [http://www.consensusdocs.org/Catalog/collaborative/ ConsensusDocs300] is a derivative of IFoA. ConsensusDocs offers contracts on Tri-Party Agreement for Integrated Project Delivery, Building Information Modeling (BIM) Addendum, and Green Building Addendum projects. 
* "AIA Document C191™–2009 is a standard form multi-party agreement through which the owner, architect, contractor [etc] execute a single agreement for the design, construction and commissioning of a project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = American Institute of Architects | title = C-Series: Other Agreements | work = Contract Documents | url = http://www.aia.org/contractdocs/AIAS076747 | date = | accessdate = 31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) provides a list of [[Integrated Project Delivery]] system distributors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/groups/aia/documents/pdf/aias076340.pdf aias076340.pdf AIA's List of IPD System Distributors, S076340]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrated Lean Project Delivery (ILPD)===
Integrated Lean Project Delivery (ILPD) is a process trademarked by The Boldt Group.&lt;ref name= ILPD-trademark&gt;{{
cite web | url = http://trademarks.justia.com/859/75/integrated-lean-project-delivery-85975067.html
| title = Integrated Lean Project Delivery (ILPD) trademark registration information | work = Trademarks | publisher = Justia | date = 3 May 2011 | accessdate = 23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created and is practiced by The Boldt Group's subsidiary, The Boldt Company. The process aims to eliminate waste across the construction value chain,&lt;ref name= Boldt-ILPD-definition&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theboldtcompany.com/page/integrated-lean-project-delivery/ | title = Integrated Lean Project Delivery | publisher = The Boldt Company | accessdate = 23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; through evaluation of initial planning and design, and examination of construction processes to predict where and when waste will occur, which is then eliminated through the use of lean tools in the IPD process.&lt;ref name=Boldt-ILPD-definition /&gt;

An ILPD contract is a multi-party agreement that specifies the use of lean practices as conceived in the Lean Project Delivery System. This distinction is needed because Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is now{{when | date = March 2013}} only referring to the multi-party agreement regardless of what practices are used, the so-called IPD-lite or IPD-ish.{{citation needed | date = March 2013}}

==Practical applications of lean construction==
{{Globalize/UK|date=September 2010}}

In the UK, a major R&amp;D project, ''Building Down Barriers'', was launched in 1997 to adapt the Toyota Production System for use in the construction sector. The resulting supply chain management toolset was tested and refined on two pilot projects and the comprehensive and detailed process-based toolset was published in 2000 as the 'Building Down Barriers Handbook of Supply Chain Management-The Essentials'.  The project demonstrated very clearly that lean thinking would only deliver major performance improvements if the construction sector learned from the extensive experience of other business sectors. Lean thinking must become the way that all the firms in the design and construction supply chain co-operate with each other at a strategic level that over-arches individual projects. In the aerospace sector, these long-term supply-side relationships are called a '[[Virtuality|Virtual]] Company', in other business sectors they are called an 'Extended Lean Enterprise'.

The UK 'Building Down Barriers Handbook of Supply Chain Management-The Essentials' states that: 'The commercial core of supply chain management is setting up long-term relationships based on improving the value of what the supply chain delivers, improving quality and reducing underlying costs through taking out waste and inefficiency. This is the opposite of 'business as usual' in the construction sector, where people do things on project after project in the same old inefficient ways, forcing each other to give up profits and overhead recovery in order to deliver at what seems the market price. What results is a fight over who keeps any of the meagre margins that result from each project, or attempts to recoup 'negative margins' through 'claims', The last thing that receives time or energy in this desperate, project-by-project gladiatorial battle for survival is consideration of how to reduce underlying costs or improve quality'.

==Last Planner System==
The Last Planner System, as developed by the Lean Construction Institute,{{citation needed |date = April 2013}} is: &lt;blockquote&gt;The collaborative, commitment-based planning system that integrates should-can-will-did planning (pull planning, make-ready, look-ahead planning) with constraint analysis, weekly work planning based upon reliable promises, and learning based upon analysis of PPC (plan percent complete) and reasons for variance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leanconstruction.org/glossary.htm ''Glossary''] Lean Construction Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Users such as owners, clients or construction companies, can use LPS to achieve better performance in design and construction through increased '''schedule/programme predictability''' (i.e. work is completed as and when promised).{{citation needed |date = April 2013}}

LPS is a system of inter-related elements, and full benefits come when all are implemented together. It is based on simple paper forms, so it can be administered using [[Post-it note]]s, paper, pencil, eraser and photocopier. A spreadsheet can help.

LPS begins with '''collaborative scheduling/programming''' engaging the main project suppliers from the start. Risk analysis ensures that float is built in where it will best protect programme integrity and predictability.  Where appropriate the process can be used for ''programme compression'' too. In this way, one constructor took 6 weeks out of an 18-week programme for the construction of a 40 bed hotel.  Benefits to the client are enormous.

[[Image:Intense discussion during a programme compression workshop.jpg]]&lt;br /&gt;
'''Figure 1: intense discussion during a programme compression workshop'''

Before work starts, team leaders '''make tasks ready''' so that when work should be done, it can be.  Why put work into production if a pre-requisite is missing?  This ''MakeReady'' process continues throughout the project.

[[Image:Part of MakeReady form.jpg]] &lt;br /&gt;
'''Figure 2: part of a MakeReady form for documenting the process of making tasks ready (this one for use in design)'''

There is a '''weekly work planning''' (WWP) meeting involving all the last planners – design team leaders and/or trade supervisors on site.  It is in everyone’s interest to explore inter-dependencies between tasks and prevent colleagues from over-committing.

[[Image:Part of a Weekly Work Plan form.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
'''Figure 3: part of a Weekly Work Plan form used by trade foremen on site or design team leaders to prepare for the WWP meeting'''.

This weekly work planning processes is built around ''promises''.  The agreed programme defines when tasks ''should'' be done and acts as a request to the supplier to do that task.  The ''last planners'' (that is the trade foremen on site or design team leaders in a design process) only promise once they have clarified the conditions of satisfaction and are clear that the task '''can''' be done.

[[Image:The promise cycle.jpg]]&lt;br /&gt;
'''Figure 4: the promise cycle (after [[Fernando Flores]])'''

Once the task is complete the last planner responsible declares completion so that site management or the next trade can assure themselves that it is complete to an appropriate standard.

A key measure of the success of the Last Planner system is '''PPC'''.  This measures the ''Percentage of Promises Completed'' on time.  As PPC increases. project productivity and profitability increase, with step changes at around 70% and 85%.  This score is measured site-wide and displayed around the site.  Weekly measures are used by the project and by individual suppliers as the basis for learning how to improve the predictability of the work programme and hence the PPC scores.

A key part of the '''continual improvement''' process is a study of the reasons why tasks promised in the WWP are delivered late.  The following chart shows typical reasons:

[[Image:Example of a reasons Pareto chart.jpg]]&lt;br /&gt;
'''Figure 5: example of a reasons Pareto chart'''

Recording the reasons in a [[Pareto chart]] like the one above makes it easy to see where attention is most likely to yield the most results.  Using tools like 5 Why analysis and cause-effect diagrams will help the team understand how they can improve the clarity of information and ensure that there are sufficient operatives.

Last Planner benefits don’t stop at project predictability, profit and productivity; it contributes to positive changes in other industry KPIs. Danish research {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} shows almost half the accidents and up to 70% less sickness absence on LPS managed sites.

LCI retains a registered Trademark on the term and Copyright in the idea and materials to prevent people who misunderstand or misrepresent the system from using it in trade. Consulting companies or individuals wishing to use the Last Planner System in trade (commercial offering of service) must first be approved by LCI. Consultants are expected to make financial and other contributions to LCI in recognition of the work and effort LCI put into developing Last Planner.

Last Planner System development continues under the direction of Lean Construction Institute Directors [https://web.archive.org/web/20070822194259/http://www.leanconstruction.org/ballardbio.htm Professor Glenn Ballard] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20010909115359/http://leanconstruction.org/howellbio.htm Greg Howell] with support from users around the world. For more information about the development process see Ballard (1994,&lt;ref name = ballard-1994/&gt; 2000) and Ballard and Howell (2004) for example.

==Differences between LC and project management approaches==
There are many differences between the Lean Construction (LC) approach and the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI) approach to construction. These include:

*Managing the interaction between activities and combined effects of dependence and variation, is a first concern in lean construction because their interactions highly affects the time and cost of projects (Howell, 1999&lt;ref name = howell-1999&gt;{{cite conference | last= Howell | first= Gregory A. | year = 1999 | title = What is Lean Construction | publisher = Lean Construction Institute | url= http://www.leanconstruction.org/pdf/Howell.pdf | booktitle = Proceedings IGLC-7 | pages= 1–10 | format= pdf | accessdate= 31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;); in comparison, these interactions are not considered in PMI.
*In lean construction, optimization efforts focus on making work flow reliable (Ballard, LPDS, 2000); in contrast PMI focuses on improving productivity of each activity which can make errors and reducing quality and result in rework.
*The project is structured and managed as a value generating process (value is defined as satisfying customer requirements);&lt;ref name = howell-1999/&gt; while PMI considers less cost as value.
*In the [[Lean manufacturing|lean]] approach, downstream stakeholders are involved in front end planning and design through cross functional teams (Ballard, LPDS, 2000). PMI doesn’t consider this issue.
*In lean construction, project control has the job of execution (Ballard, PhD thesis, 2000&lt;ref name =ballard-thesis/&gt;); whereas, control in PMI method relies on variance detection after-the-fact.
*In the lean approach, pull techniques govern the [[Value stream mapping|flow]] of information and materials, from upstream to downstream;&lt;ref name =ballard-thesis/&gt; with PMI, push techniques govern the release of information and materials.
*Capacity and inventory are adjusted to absorb variation ([[Mura (Japanese term)|Mura]]). Feedback loops, included at every level, help ensure minimal inventories and rapid system response;&lt;ref name =ballard-thesis/&gt; in comparison, PMI doesn’t consider adjustments.
*Lean construction tries to mitigate variation in every aspect (product quality, rate of work) and manage the remaining variation, while PMI doesn’t consider variation mitigation and management.&lt;ref name =ballard-thesis/&gt;
*Lean approach tries to make continuous improvements in the process, workflows and product;&lt;ref name = howell-1999/&gt; whereas PMI approach doesn’t pay that much attention to continuous improvement.
*In lean construction, decision making is distributed in design production control systems;&lt;ref name =ballard-thesis/&gt; by comparison, in PMI decision making is centered to one manager some times.
*Lean construction tries to increase transparency between the stakeholders, managers and labourers, in order to know the impact of their work on the whole project;&lt;ref name = howell-1999/&gt; on the other hand, PMI doesn’t consider transparency in its methods.
*In lean construction a buffer of sound assignments is maintained for each crew or production unit;&lt;ref name =ballard-thesis/&gt; in contrast, PMI method doesn’t consider a backlog for crews.
*Lean construction is developing new forms of commercial contracts to give incentives to suppliers for reliable work flow and optimization at the deliverable-to-the-client level;&lt;ref name = howell-1999/&gt; while PMI doesn’t have such policy.
*Lean construction production system design resists the tendency toward local suboptimization,&lt;ref name =ballard-thesis/&gt; however, PMI persists on optimizing each activity.
*The PMI-driven approach only considers managing a project at the macro-level.  This is necessary but not sufficient for the success of projects.  Lean Construction encompasses Project and Production Management, and formally recognizes that any successful project undertaking will inevitably involve the interaction between project and production management.

'''Leuckart's law''' is an [[empirical law]] in [[zoology]] that states that the size of the eye of an animal is related to its maximum speed of movement; fast-moving animals have larger eyes, after allowing for the effects of [[body mass]]. The hypothesis dates from 1876,&lt;ref name=hugh/&gt; and in older literature is usually referred to as '''Leuckart's ratio'''.&lt;ref name=stew/&gt;

The principle was initially applied to birds; it has also been applied to mammals.&lt;ref name=heard/&gt;

==Criticism==
A study of 88 bird species, published in 2011, found no useful correlation between flight speed and eye size.&lt;ref name=hall/&gt;

{{terrorism}}
A '''lone wolf''', '''lone-wolf terrorist''', or '''lone actor''', is someone who prepares and commits violent acts alone, outside of any command structure and without material assistance from any group. He or she may be influenced or motivated by the ideology and beliefs of an external group and may act in support of such a group. In its original sense, a "[[Lone wolf (trait)|lone wolf]]" is an animal or person that generally lives or spends time alone instead of with a group.&lt;ref name="reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lone+wolf|title=Lone wolf - Define Lone wolf at Dictionary.com|work=[[Dictionary.com]]|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observers note the attacks are a relatively rare type of terrorist attack but have been increasing in number,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/lone-wolf-attacks-are-becoming-more-common-and-more-deadly/|title=Lone Wolf Attacks Are Becoming More Common -- And More Deadly|last=|first=|date=14 July 2016|work=|newspaper=FRONTLINE|language=en-US|access-date=4 February 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is sometimes difficult to tell whether an actor has received outside help and what appears to be a lone wolf attack may actually have been carefully orchestrated from outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/asia/isis-messaging-app-terror-plot.html|title=Not 'Lone Wolves' After All: How ISIS Guides World's Terror Plots From Afar|last=Callimachi|first=Rukmini|date=4 February 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gartenstein-Ross|first=Daveed|last2=Barr|first2=Nathaniel|date=26 July 2016|year=|title=The Myth of Lone-Wolf Terrorism|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/western-europe/2016-07-26/myth-lone-wolf-terrorism|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=|pages=|via=|access-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The term "lone wolf" was popularized by [[white supremacist]]s Alex Curtis and [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]] in the 1990s. Metzger advocated individual or small-cell underground activity, as opposed to above-ground membership organizations, envisaging "warriors acting alone or in small groups who attacked the government or other targets in 'daily, anonymous acts.'"&lt;ref name="Adl.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/Metzger.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=7 |title=Tom Metzger and White Aryan Resistance (WAR) – Extremism in America |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925190751/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/Metzger.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=7 |archivedate=25 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimmel|first1=Michael|title=Angry White Men: American Masculinity at the End of an Era|date=2013|publisher=Avalon|isbn=1568585136|pages=228–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorism expert Brian Michael Jenkins of the [[RAND Corporation]] prefers the term ''stray dog'' to ''lone wolf''. According to Jenkins, most individuals involved in such attacks "skulk about, sniffing at violence, vocally aggressive but skittish without backup".&lt;ref name="Daily Beast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel |first1=Jacob |title=Lone Wolves, Terrorist Runts, and the Stray Dogs of ISIS |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/24/in-canada-the-stray-dogs-of-isis.html |accessdate=7 November 2014 |work=[[Daily Beast]] |date=24 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archivedate=7 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107133653/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/24/in-canada-the-stray-dogs-of-isis.html |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Though these individuals seem to be acting alone, there are often ties between lone wolves and terrorist organisations for example, terrorist backed online content.&lt;ref&gt;: http://doi.org/10.15664/jtr.405&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage==
The term "lone wolf" is used by [[List of law enforcement agencies#United States|US law enforcement agencies]] and the media to refer to individuals undertaking violent acts of terrorism outside a command structure. The [[FBI]] and [[San Diego Police]]'s investigation into the activities of a self-professed white supremacist, Alex Curtis, was named [[Operation Lone Wolf]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.fbi.gov/sandiego/about-us/history/operation-lone-wolf|title=Operation Lone Wolf|publisher=[[FBI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "largely due to Curtis' encouragement of other white supremacists to follow what Curtis refers to as 'lone wolf' activism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Lone Wolf|url=https://www.fbi.gov/sandiego/about-us/history/operation-lone-wolf|publisher=FBI|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term lone wolf is used to distinguish terrorist actions carried out by individuals from those coordinated by large groups.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Lone Wolf Terrorism: Global Patterns, Motivations and Prevention|last=Spaaij|first=Ramon|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Terrorist attacks that are carried out by small cells are not classified as lone wolf attacks. Lone wolf attacks are far more rare than attacks carried out by groups. Since 1940, there have only been around 100 successful lone wolf attacks in the United States.'''&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/lone-wolf-attacks-are-becoming-more-common-and-more-deadly/|title=Lone Wolf Attacks Are Becoming More Common And More Deadly|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''The number of attacks is increasing, however, and has grown each year since 2000. Lone wolves generally come from different demographics than far right attackers as well. As compared to those on the far right, lone wolf attackers who become inspired by al-Qaeda and ISIS tend to be younger and better educated. According to studies, lone wolves have more in common with [[mass murder]]ers than they do with members of the organized terrorist groups that often inspire them.

While the lone wolf acts to advance the ideological or philosophical beliefs of an extremist group, they act on their own, without any outside command or direction. The lone wolf's tactics and methods are conceived and directed solely on their own; in many cases, such as the tactics described by Curtis, the lone wolf never has personal contact with the group they identify with. As such, it is considerably more difficult for [[counter-terrorism]] officials to gather intelligence on lone wolves, since they may not come into contact with routine counter-terrorist surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://icct.nl/publication/understanding-lone-wolves-towards-a-theoretical-framework-for-comparative-analysis/ | title=Understanding Lone Wolves: Towards a Theoretical Framework for Comparative Analysis | author1=Jan Leenaars | author2=Dr. Alastair Reed | publisher=The [[International Centre for Counter-Terrorism]] – The Hague (ICCT) | date=2 May 2016 | accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 analysis by Sarah Teich, a research assistant at the [[International Institute for Counter-Terrorism]], found five emerging trends in Islamist lone wolf terrorism in North America and western Europe between 1990 and 2013:
*An increase in the number of countries targeted by lone wolves from the 1990s to the 2000s.
*An increase in the number of people injured and killed by lone wolves.
*Increased effectiveness of law enforcement and counter-terrorism.
*Consistency in the distribution of attacks by "actor types" (loners, lone wolves, and lone wolf packs).
*An increase in the number of attacks against military personnel.&lt;ref name="ict.org.il"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ict.org.il/Article.aspx?ID=691|title=Trends and Developments in Lone Wolf Terrorism in the Western World|last=Teich|first=Sarah|date=October 2013|publisher=[[International Institute for Counter-Terrorism]]|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, lone wolves may present a greater threat than organized groups, and terrorists have not been limited to Muslims. According to the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]],'' "With the exception of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|attacks on the World Trade Center]], experts say the major terrorist attacks in the United States have been perpetrated by deranged individuals who were sympathetic to a larger cause – from [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma City bomber]] [[Timothy McVeigh]] to the Washington area sniper [[John Allen Muhammad]]," both native-born Americans.&lt;ref name="Csmonitor.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0527/p02s02-usju.html |title=Lone wolves pose explosive terror threat |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date=27 May 2003 |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', counter-terrorism officials refer to "lone individuals known to authorities but not considered important enough to escalate investigations" as "known wolves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/f7795146-10a8-11e7-a88c-50ba212dce4d |title='Known wolf' attackers force intelligence rethink |first=Sam |last=Jones |date=24 March 2017 |work=Financial Times |accessdate=2 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups actively advocate lone wolf actions. Anti-abortion [[Militant (word)|militant]] terrorist group The [[Army of God (USA)|Army of God]] uses "[[leaderless resistance]]" as its organizing principle.&lt;ref name="Jennifer Gonnerman"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jennifer Gonnerman |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/1998-11-10/news/the-terrorist-campaign-against-abortion/3 |title=Villagvoice.com |publisher=Villagevoice.com |date=10 November 1998 |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', in news analysis of the [[Boston Marathon bombings]], the Al-Qaeda activist [[Samir Khan]], publishing in ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]'', advocated individual terrorist actions directed at Americans and published detailed recipes online.&lt;ref name=NYT5513&gt;{{cite news|title=A Homemade Style of Terror: Jihadists Push New Tactics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/06/us/terrorists-find-online-education-for-attacks.html|accessdate=6 May 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 May 2013|author=Scott Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misidentification===
Lone wolf terrorists are frequently thought to only be Muslims, however, this is not always the case. Lone wolf terrorists may sympathize with and consider themselves part of larger groups, but they are not truly a part of them.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Lone Wolf Terrorism: Global Patterns, Motivations and Prevention|last=Spaaij|first=Ramon|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' Often, the attacks are attributed to people who have a mixture of political and personal grievances. The attackers can have no actual affiliation to the group that claims them, but instead become radicalized online and through external media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Global|first=IndraStra|title=OPINION {{!}} What Drives Lone Offenders?|url=http://www.indrastra.com/2017/10/OPINION-What-Drives-Lone-Offenders-003-10-2017-0005.html|journal=IndraStra|issn=2381-3652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of terrorists determined by authorities to have been lone wolf attacks inspired by [[ISIS]] and/or its ideology, were later found to have been recruited, trained and directed remotely by ISIL to carry out the attacks.&lt;ref name="NotLoneWolf"&gt;{{cite news|title=Not 'Lone Wolves' After All: How ISIS Guides World's Terror Plots From Afar |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/asia/isis-messaging-app-terror-plot.html |accessdate=5 February 2017 |publisher=New York Times |date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health factors==
Lone wolf terrorists are highly likely to be afflicted by a mental illness. Studies have found that more than 40% of lone wolf terrorists have been diagnosed at some point in their life with a mental illness.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; This puts lone wolves as being 13.5 times more likely to suffer from a mental illness than a member of an organized terrorist group, such as al-Qaeda or ISIS.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/lone-wolf-terrorism|title=Lone Wolf Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental health challenges are thought to make some individuals among the many who suffer from certain "psychological disturbances," vulnerable to being inspired by extremist ideologies to commit acts of lone wolf terrorism.&lt;ref name="MentalIllnessKayFactor"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mental Illness: A Key Factor in "Terror"|url=http://bridge.georgetown.edu/mental-illness-a-key-factor-in-terror/|accessdate=16 February 2017|agency=Johns Hopkins University|publisher=Bridge Initiative Team|date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LoneWoldTerrorism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alfaro-Gonzalez|first1=Lydia|title=Report: Lone Wolf Terrorism|date=27 July 2015|publisher=Security Studies Program, Natoonal Security Critical Issue Task Force|url=http://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NCITF-Final-Paper.pdf|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On 15 December 2014, [[2014 Sydney hostage crisis|a hostage crisis in the Lindt Café]] in [[Martin Place, Sydney]] ended with three deaths, including the suspect [[Man Haron Monis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fraser|first1=Jill|title=Australian expert warns of 'lone wolf' terror risk|url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/news/437309--australian-expert-warns-of-lone-wolf-terror-risk|accessdate=26 December 2014|work=Anadolou Agency|date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is doubt as to whether or not Monis fit the definition of a lone wolf terrorist. Queensland University of Technology criminologist Associate Professor Mark Lauchs said it was important the siege wasn't elevated to a "terrorist attack" as such. Associate Professor Lauchs said Monis was simply a deranged person running a hostage situation: "This incident was not about religion and neither was it a terrorist attack, but given that perception by the paraphernalia Monis used."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/man-haron-monis-why-did-he-carry-out-sydney-siege/story-fnj3rq0y-1227159748676|title=Man Haron Monis: Why did he carry out Sydney siege?|work=NewsComAu|accessdate=17 July 2015|date=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian [[Prime Minister]] Tony Abbott said, "[Man Haron Monis] had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability. As the siege unfolded yesterday, he sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] death cult." Former counter-terrorism adviser to the White House Richard Clarke said, "I don't think this was a lone wolf terrorist, I don't think this was a terrorist at all, I think this was someone who was committing suicide by police as a lot of people with mental problems do, and now, if they say they're a terrorist, if they say they're somehow associated with ISIS or Al Qaeda, it becomes a major event that shuts down the city and gets international attention. This was a person with a mental problem who tried to gain attention and succeeded, tried to shut down the city and succeeded, merely by putting up a flag that was something like the flag of ISIS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1684772/experts-say-sydney-hostage-taker-man-haron-monis-wasnt-a-terrorist-just-a-man-with-mental-problems/|title=Experts Say Sydney Hostage Taker Man Haron Monis Wasn't A Terrorist, Just A Man With Mental Problems|work=The Inquisitr News|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5765">{{one source|date=August 2015}}&lt;!--everything is By Nassim or citing and explaining Nassim--&gt;
The '''ludic fallacy''', identified by [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] in his book ''[[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|The Black Swan]]'' ([[2007 in books|2007]]), is "the misuse of [[game]]s to model real-life situations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sicart |first=François |url=http://www.tocqueville.com/article/show/204 |title=Black Swans, the Ludic Fallacy and Wealth Management |publisher=Tocqueville |date=26 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223090355/http://www.tocqueville.com/article/show/204 |archivedate=2007-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taleb explains the fallacy as "basing studies of chance on the narrow world of games and dice".&lt;ref name="blackswan"&gt;Taleb, Nassim (2007). ''The Black Swan''. New York: Random House. p. 309. {{ISBN|1-4000-6351-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective ''ludic'' originates from the Latin noun ''[[wikt:ludus|ludus]]'', meaning "play, game, sport, pastime".&lt;ref name="simpson1987"&gt;Simpson, D.P. (1987). ''Cassell's Latin and English Dictionary''. New York: Hungry Minds. p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The fallacy is a central argument in the book and a rebuttal of the predictive mathematical models used to predict the future – as well as an attack on the idea of applying naïve and simplified statistical models in complex domains. According to Taleb, statistics is applicable only in some domains, for instance [[casino]]s in which the odds are visible and defined. Taleb's argument centers on the idea that predictive models are based on [[platonic realism|platonified forms]], gravitating towards mathematical purity and failing to take various aspects into account:{{fact|date=November 2018}}

* It is impossible to be in possession of the entirety of available information.
* Small unknown variations in the data could have a huge impact. Taleb differentiates his idea from that of mathematical notions in [[chaos theory]] (e.g., the [[butterfly effect]]).
* Theories or models based on empirical data are claimed to be flawed as they may not be able to predict events which are previously unobserved, but have tremendous impact (e.g., the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]] or the [[History of the automobile|invention of the automobile]]), a.k.a. [[black swan theory]].

==Examples==
===Example: Suspicious coin===
One example given in the book is the following [[thought experiment]]. Two people are involved:
* Dr. John who is regarded as a man of science and logical thinking
* Fat Tony who is regarded as a man who lives by his wits

A third party asks them to "assume that a coin is fair, i.e., has an equal probability of coming up heads or tails when flipped. I flip it ninety-nine times and get heads each time. What are the odds of my getting tails on my next throw?"
* Dr. John says that the odds are not affected by the previous outcomes so the odds must still be [[Odds#Even odds|50:50]].
* Fat Tony says that the odds of the coin coming up heads 99 times in a row are so low that the initial assumption that the coin had a 50:50 chance of coming up heads is most likely incorrect.  "The coin gotta be loaded. It can't be a fair game."

The ludic fallacy here is to assume that in real life the rules from the purely hypothetical model (where Dr. John is correct) apply.  Would a reasonable person bet on black on a [[roulette]] table that has come up red 99 times in a row (especially as the reward for a correct guess is so low when compared with the probable odds that the game is fixed)?{{Clarify|reason=what are "probable odds" - would a reasonable person bet on a far roulette wheel?|date=February 2017}}

In classical terms, [[statistically significant]] events, i.e. unlikely events, should make one question one's model assumptions. In [[Bayesian statistics]], this can be modelled by using a [[prior distribution]] for one's assumptions on the fairness of the coin, then [[Bayesian inference]] to update this distribution.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Example: Fighting===
Nassim Taleb shares an example that comes from his friend and trading partner, [[Mark Spitznagel]]. "A martial version of the ludic fallacy: organized competitive fighting trains the athlete to focus on the game and, in order not to dissipate his concentration, to ignore the possibility of what is not specifically allowed by the rules, such as kicks to the groin, a surprise knife, et cetera. So those who win gold medal might be precisely those who will be most vulnerable in real life."&lt;ref name=blackswan/&gt;

==Relation to platonicity==
The ludic fallacy is a specific case of the more general problem of platonicity, defined by Nassim Taleb as:
{{bq|quote=the focus on those pure, well-defined, and easily discernible objects like triangles, or more social notions like friendship or love, at the cost of ignoring those objects of seemingly messier and less tractable structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Nelson Mandela International Day''' (or '''Mandela Day''') is an annual international day in honour of [[Nelson Mandela]], celebrated each year on 18 July, Mandela's birthday.&lt;ref name="UN18"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.un.org/en/events/mandeladay/ |title=Nelson Mandela International Day, July 18, For Freedom, Justice and Democracy |first= |last= |work=un.org |year=|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day was officially declared by the [[United Nations]] in November 2009,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/UNGARsn/2009/64.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with the first UN Mandela Day held on 18 July 2010. However, other groups began celebrating Mandela Day on 18 July 2009.

On 27 April 2009, the [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] concerts and the [[Nelson Mandela|Nelson Mandela Foundation]] invited the global community to join them in support of an official Mandela Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nelsonmandela.org/news/entry/the-nelson-mandela-foundation-and-46664-call-for-the-establishment-of-a-glo|title=The Nelson Mandela Foundation and 46664 call for the establishment of a global ‘Mandela Day’ – Nelson Mandela Foundation|website=www.nelsonmandela.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela Day is not meant as a public holiday, but as a day to honour the legacy of [[Nelson Mandela]], South Africa's former President, and his values, through [[volunteering]] and [[community service]].&lt;ref name=UN18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS138319+27-Apr-2009+PRN20090427 |title=46664 and the Nelson Mandela Foundation Call for Establishment of Global 'Mandela... |publisher=Reuters |date= 27 April 2009|accessdate=31 July 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandela Day is a global call to action that celebrates the idea that each individual has the power to [[social change|transform the world]], the ability to make an impact.

The Mandela Day campaign message is:

: "Nelson Mandela has fought for [[social justice]] for 67 years. We're asking you to start with 67 minutes."&lt;ref name="Mandela Day"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mandeladay.com/ |title=Mandela Day |publisher=Mandela Day |date= |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To mark the first global celebration of Mandela Day on 18 July 2009, Mandela's 91st birthday, a series of educational, art exhibit, fund-raising and volunteer events leading up to a concert at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on 18 July were organised by the 46664 concerts and the Nelson Mandela Foundation.&lt;ref name="Mandela Day"/&gt; In November 2009, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] formally declared 18 July to be "Nelson Mandela International Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8353853.stm|title=UN gives backing to 'Mandela Day' |date=11 November 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42349">In [[economics]], utility is the satisfaction or benefit derived by consuming a product; thus the '''marginal utility''' of a [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] is the change in the utility from an increase in the [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of that good or service. 

In the context of [[cardinal utility]], economists sometimes speak of a '''law of diminishing marginal utility''', meaning that the first [[units of measurement|unit]] of consumption of a good or service yields more utility than the second and subsequent units, with a continuing reduction for greater amounts. Therefore, the fall in marginal utility as consumption increases is known as diminishing marginal utility. Mathematically:
:MU&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;MU&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;MU&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;......&gt;MU&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

== Marginality ==
The term ''marginal'' refers to a small change, starting from some baseline level. As [[Philip Wicksteed]] explained the term,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marginal considerations are considerations which concern a slight increase or diminution of the stock of anything which we possess or are considering&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910), Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Frequently the marginal change is assumed to start from the [[Capital (economics)#Endowment|endowment]], meaning the total resources available for consumption (see [[Budget constraint]]). This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made by the individual himself or herself and by others.

For reasons of tractability, it is often assumed in [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical analysis]] that goods and services are [[Continuum (theory)|continuously divisible]]. Under this assumption, [[marginal concepts]], including marginal utility, may be expressed in terms of [[differential calculus]]. Marginal utility can then be defined as the first derivative of total utility—the total satisfaction obtained from consumption of a good or service—with respect to the amount of consumption of that good or service.

In practice the smallest relevant division may be quite large. Sometimes economic analysis concerns the marginal values associated with a change of one unit of a discrete good or service, such as a motor vehicle or a haircut. For a motor vehicle, the total number of motor vehicles produced is large enough for a continuous assumption to be reasonable: this may not be true for, say, an aircraft carrier.

== Utility ==
{{Main|Utility}}
Depending on which theory of ''utility'' is used, the interpretation of marginal utility can be meaningful or not. Economists have commonly described utility as if it were ''quantifiable'', that is, as if different levels of utility could be compared along a numerical scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler|Stigler, George Joseph]]; ''The Development of Utility Theory'', I and II, ''Journal of Political Economy'' (1950), issues 3 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler|Stigler, George Joseph]]; ''The Adoption of Marginal Utility Theory'', ''History of Political Economy'' (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; This has affected the development and reception of theories of marginal utility. Quantitative concepts of utility allow familiar arithmetic operations, and further assumptions of continuity and differentiability greatly increase tractability.

Contemporary mainstream economic theory frequently defers metaphysical questions, and merely notes or assumes that preference structures conforming to certain rules can be usefully ''proxied'' by associating goods, services, or their uses with quantities, and ''defines'' "utility" as such a quantification.&lt;ref&gt;[[David M. Kreps|Kreps, David Marc]]; ''A Course in Microeconomic Theory'', Chapter two: ''The theory of consumer choice and demand'', ''Utility representations''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another conception is [[Utilitarianism|Benthamite philosophy]], which equated usefulness with the production of pleasure and avoidance of pain,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham, Jeremy]]; ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'', Chapter I §I–III.&lt;/ref&gt; assumed subject to arithmetic operation.&lt;ref&gt;Bentham, Jeremy; ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'', Chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt; British economists, under the influence of this philosophy (especially by way of [[John Stuart Mill]]), viewed utility as "the feelings of pleasure and pain"&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, William Stanley; “Brief Account of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy”, ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'' v29 (June 1866) §2.&lt;/ref&gt; and further as a "''quantity'' of feeling" (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, William Stanley; ''Brief Account of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy'', ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society'' v29 (June 1866) §4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though generally pursued outside of the mainstream methods, there are conceptions of utility that do not rely on quantification.
For example, the [[Austrian school]] generally attributes value to ''the satisfaction of wants'',&lt;ref&gt;Menger, Carl; ''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre'' (''Principles of Economics'') Chapter 2 §2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen"&gt;[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Georgescu-Roegen, Nicholas]]; ''Utility'', ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes rejects even the ''possibility'' of quantification.&lt;ref name="mises" &gt;[[Ludwig von Mises|von Mises, Ludwig Heinrich]]; ''Theorie des Geldes und der Umlaufsmittel'' (1912).&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been argued that the Austrian framework makes it possible to consider rational preferences that would otherwise be excluded.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch"&gt;Mc Culloch, James Huston; [https://www.mises.org/etexts/mcCulloch.pdf “The Austrian Theory of the Marginal Use and of Ordinal Marginal Utility”,] ''Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie'' 37 (1977) #3&amp;amp;4 (September).&lt;/ref&gt;

In any standard framework, the same object may have different marginal utilities for different people, reflecting different preferences or individual circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Herbert Joseph; ''The Economics of Enterprise'' (1913) Ch VII, pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept in cardinal utility theory that marginal utilities diminish across the ranges relevant to decision-making is called the "law of diminishing marginal utility" (and is also known as [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen|Gossen]]'s [[Gossen's laws|First Law]]). This refers to the increase in utility an individual gains from increasing their consumption of a particular good. "The law of diminishing marginal utility is at the heart of the explanation of numerous economic phenomena, including [[time preference]] and the [[Value (economics)|value of goods]] ... The law says, first, that the marginal utility of each homogenous unit decreases as the supply of units increases (and vice versa); second, that the marginal utility of a larger-sized unit is greater than the marginal utility of a smaller-sized unit (and vice versa). The first law denotes the law of diminishing marginal utility, the second law denotes the law of increasing total utility."&lt;ref name=Mises/&gt;

In modern economics, choice under conditions of certainty at a single point in time  is modeled via [[ordinal utility]], in which the numbers assigned to the utility of a particular circumstance of the individual have no meaning by themselves, but which of two alternative circumstances has higher utility ''is'' meaningful. With ordinal utility, a person's preferences have no unique marginal utility, and thus whether or not marginal utility is diminishing is not meaningful. In contrast, the concept of diminishing marginal utility is meaningful in the context of [[cardinal utility]], which in modern economics is used in analyzing [[intertemporal choice]], [[expected utility hypothesis|choice under uncertainty]], and [[social welfare function|social welfare]].

The law of diminishing marginal utility is similar to the law of [[diminishing returns]] which states that as the amount of one [[Factors of production|factor of production]] increases as all other factors of production are held the same, the marginal return (extra output gained by adding an extra unit) decreases.

As the rate of commodity acquisition increases, ''marginal'' utility decreases. If commodity consumption continues to rise, marginal utility at some point may fall to '''zero''', reaching '''maximum''' total utility. Further increase in consumption of units of commodities causes marginal utility to become '''negative'''; this signifies '''dissatisfaction'''. For example,
* beyond some point, further doses of antibiotics would kill no pathogens at all, and might even become harmful to the body.
* to satiate thirst a person drinks water but beyond a point, consumption of more water might make the person vomit, hence leading to negative marginal and thus diminished total utility
* it takes a certain amount of food energy to sustain a population, yet beyond a point, more calories cannot be consumed and are simply discarded (or cause disease).

Diminishing marginal utility is traditionally a microeconomic concept and often holds for an individual, although the marginal utility of a good or service might be ''increasing'' as well. For example:
* bed sheets, which up to some number may only provide warmth, but after that point may be useful to allow one to effect an escape by being tied together into a rope;
* tickets, for travel or theatre, where a second ticket might allow one to take a date on an otherwise uninteresting outing;
* dosages of antibiotics, where having too few pills would leave bacteria with greater resistance, but a full supply could effect a cure.
* the third leg is more useful than the first two when building a chair.

As suggested elsewhere in this article, occasionally one may come across a situation in which marginal utility increases even at a macroeconomic level. For example, the provision of a service may only be viable if it accessible to most or all of the population, and the marginal utility of a raw material required to provide such a service will increase at the "tipping point" at which this occurs. This is similar to the position with very large items such as aircraft carriers: the numbers of these items involved are so small that marginal utility is no longer a helpful concept, as there is merely a simple "yes" or "no" decision.

== Marginalist theory ==
[[Marginalism]] explains choice with the hypothesis that people decide whether to effect any given change based on the marginal utility of that change, with rival alternatives being chosen based upon which has the greatest marginal utility.

=== Market price and diminishing marginal utility ===
If an individual possesses a good or service whose marginal utility to him is less than that of some other good or service for which he could trade it, then it is in his interest to effect that trade. Of course, as one thing is sold and another is bought, the respective marginal gains or losses from further trades will change. If the marginal utility of one thing is diminishing, and the other is not increasing, all else being equal, an individual will demand an increasing ratio of that which is acquired to that which is sacrificed. (One important way in which all else might not be equal is when the use of the one good or service complements that of the other. In such cases, exchange ratios might be constant.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;) If any trader can better his position by offering a trade more favorable to complementary traders, then he will do so.

In an economy with [[money]], the marginal utility of a quantity is simply that of the best good or service that it could purchase. In this way it is useful for explaining [[supply and demand]], as well as essential aspects of models of [[imperfect competition]].

==== The paradox of water and diamonds ====
{{Main|Paradox of value}}
The "paradox of water and diamonds", usually most commonly associated with [[Adam Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam; ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Chapter IV. "Of the Origin and Use of Money"&lt;/ref&gt; though recognized by earlier thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first = Scott|last = Gordon|year = 1991|title = History and Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|chapter = The Scottish Enlightenment of the eighteenth century|publisher = [[Routledge]]|isbn = 0-415-09670-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the apparent contradiction that water possesses a value far lower than diamonds, even though water is far more vital to a human being.

Price is determined by both marginal utility and marginal cost, and here the key to the "paradox" is that the marginal cost of water is far lower than that of diamonds.

That is not to say that the price of any good or service is simply a function of the marginal utility that it has for any one individual nor for some ostensibly typical individual. Rather, individuals are willing to trade based upon the respective marginal utilities of the goods that they have or desire (with these marginal utilities being distinct for each potential trader), and prices thus develop constrained by these marginal utilities.

== Quantified marginal utility ==
Under the [[special case]] in which usefulness can be quantified, the change in utility of moving from state &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; to state &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U=U(S_2)-U(S_1)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, if &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; are distinguishable by values of just one variable &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; which is itself quantified, then it becomes possible to speak of the ratio of the marginal utility of the change in &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; to the size of that change:
[[Image:UtilityQuantified.svg|thumb|right|400px|Diminishing marginal utility, given quantification]]
:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;
(where “[[ceteris paribus|c.p.]]” indicates that the ''only'' [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]] to change is &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt;).

Mainstream neoclassical economics will typically assume that the limit
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta g\to 0} \left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;
exists, and use “marginal utility” to refer to the [[partial derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U}{\partial g}=\lim_{\Delta g\to 0}\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;.
Accordingly, diminishing marginal utility corresponds to the condition
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial g^2}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

== History ==
The concept of marginal utility grew out of attempts by economists to explain the determination of price.  The term “marginal utility”, credited to the [[Austrian School|Austrian]] economist [[Friedrich von Wieser]] by [[Alfred Marshall]],&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Alfred; ''Principles of Economics'',  3 Ch 3 Note.&lt;/ref&gt; was a translation of Wieser's term “Grenznutzen” (''border-use'').&lt;ref name="wieser_ein"&gt;von Wieser,  Friedrich; ''Über  den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and  Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p.  128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="wieser_zwei"&gt;Wieser, Friedrich von; ''Der natürliche Werth''  &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Natural Value''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1889), Bk I Ch V  “Marginal Utility” ([http://praxeology.net/FW-NV-I-5.htm HTML]).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proto-marginalist approaches ===
Perhaps the essence of a notion of diminishing marginal utility can be found in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], wherein he writes {{Quotation|external goods have a limit, like any other instrument, and all things useful are of such a nature that where there is too much of them they must either do harm, or at any rate be of no use&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''Politics'', Bk 7 Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}} (There has been marked disagreement about the development and role of marginal considerations in Aristotle's value theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soudek |first=Josef |title=Aristotle's Theory of Exchange: An Inquiry into the Origin of Economic Analysis |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=96 |issue=1 |year=1952 |pages=45–75 |jstor=3143742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kauder"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kauder |first=Emil |title=Genesis of the Marginal Utility Theory from Aristotle to the End of the Eighteenth Century |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=63 |issue=251 |year=1953 |pages=638–50 |jstor=2226451 |doi=10.2307/2226451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gordon |first=Barry Lewis John |title=Aristotle and the Development of Value Theory |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=115–28 |year=1964 |jstor=1880547 |doi=10.2307/1880547}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schumArist"&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph Alois; ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954) Part II Chapter 1 §3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, Scott; ''Aristoteles' Economic Thought'' (1995) Chapters 1, 2, &amp; 6.&lt;/ref&gt;)

A great variety of economists have concluded that there is ''some'' sort of interrelationship between utility and rarity that affects economic decisions, and in turn informs the determination of prices. Diamonds are priced higher than water because their marginal utility is higher than water .&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Přibram|Přibram, Karl]]; ''A History of Economic Reasoning'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteenth-century Italian [[Mercantilism|mercantilists]], such as [[Antonio Genovesi]], [[Giammaria Ortes]], [[Pietro Verri]], [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Marchese Cesare di Beccaria]], and [[Giovanni Rinaldo|Count Giovanni Rinaldo Carli]], held that value was explained in terms of the general utility and of scarcity, though they did not typically work-out a theory of how these interacted.&lt;ref name="pribramItalMerc"&gt;Pribram, Karl; ''A History of Economic Reasoning'' (1983), Chapter 5 “Refined Mercantilism”, “Italian Mercantilists”.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Della moneta'' (1751), Abbé [[Ferdinando Galiani]], a pupil of Genovesi, attempted to explain value as a ratio of two ratios, ''utility'' and ''scarcity'', with the latter component ratio being the ratio of quantity to use.
[[Image:Richard Whately.jpg|thumb|right|105px|Richard Whately]]
[[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]], in ''Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution de richesse'' (1769), held that value derived from the general utility of the class to which a good belonged, from comparison of present and future wants, and from anticipated difficulties in procurement.

Like the Italian mercantists, [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Étienne Bonnot, Abbé de Condillac]], saw value as determined by utility associated with the class to which the good belong, and by estimated scarcity.  In ''De commerce et le gouvernement'' (1776), Condillac emphasized that value is not based upon cost but that costs were paid because of value.

This last point was famously restated by the Nineteenth Century proto-marginalist, [[Richard Whately]], who in ''Introductory Lectures on Political Economy'' (1832) wrote {{Quotation|It is not that pearls fetch a high price because men have dived for them; but on the contrary, men dive for them because they fetch a high price.&lt;ref&gt;Whately, Richard; ''Introductory Lectures on Political Economy, Being part of a course delivered in the Easter term'' (1832).&lt;/ref&gt;}} (Whatley's student [[Nassau William Senior|Senior]] is noted below as an early marginalist.)

=== Marginalists before the Revolution ===
[[Image:Gabriel Cramer.jpg|thumb|105px|Gabriel Cramer]]

The first unambiguous published statement of any sort of theory of marginal utility was by [[Daniel Bernoulli]], in “Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis”.&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Daniel; “Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis” in ''Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae'' 5 (1738); reprinted in translation as “Exposition of a new theory on the measurement of risk” in ''Econometrica'' 22 (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;  This paper appeared in 1738, but a draft had been written in 1731 or in 1732.&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Daniel; letter of 4 July 1731 to Nicolas Bernoulli ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Nicolas; letter of 5 April 1732, acknowledging receipt of “Specimen theoriae novae metiendi sortem pecuniariam” ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1728, [[Gabriel Cramer]] had produced fundamentally the same theory in a private letter.&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, Garbriel; letter of 21 May 1728 to [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli|Nicolaus Bernoulli]] ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  Each had sought to resolve the [[St. Petersburg paradox]], and had concluded that the marginal desirability of money decreased as it was accumulated, more specifically such that the desirability of a sum were the [[natural logarithm]] (Bernoulli) or [[square root]] (Cramer) thereof.  However, the more general implications of this hypothesis were not explicated, and the work fell into obscurity.

In [http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/lloyd/value “A Lecture on the Notion of Value as Distinguished Not Only from Utility, but also from Value in Exchange”], delivered in 1833 and included in ''Lectures on Population, Value, Poor Laws and Rent'' (1837), [[William Forster Lloyd]] explicitly offered a general marginal utility theory, but did not offer its derivation nor elaborate its implications.  The importance of his statement seems to have been lost on everyone (including Lloyd) until the early 20th century, by which time others had independently developed and popularized the same insight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman |last=Seligman |first=E. R. A. |title=On Some Neglected British Economists |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=13 |issue=51 |pages=335–63 |year=1903 |jstor=2221519 |doi=10.2307/2221519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''An Outline of the Science of Political Economy'' (1836), [[Nassau William Senior]] asserted that marginal utilities were the ultimate determinant of demand, yet apparently did not pursue implications, though some interpret his work as indeed doing just that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=White |first=Michael V. |title=Diamonds Are Forever(?): Nassau Senior and Utility Theory |journal=[[The Manchester School (journal)|The Manchester School]] |volume=60 |year=1992 |issue=1 |pages=64–78 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9957.1992.tb00211.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In “De la mesure de l’utilité des travaux publics” (1844), [[Jules Dupuit]] applied a conception of marginal utility to the problem of determining bridge tolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dupuit |first=Jules |title=De la mesure de l’utilité des travaux publics |journal=Annales des ponts et chaussées |series=Second series |volume=8 |year=1844 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] published ''Die Entwicklung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs und der daraus fließenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln'', which presented a marginal utility theory and to a very large extent worked-out its implications for the behavior of a market economy.  However, Gossen's work was not well received in the Germany of his time, most copies were destroyed unsold, and he was virtually forgotten until rediscovered after the so-called Marginal Revolution.

=== The Marginal Revolution ===
Marginalism eventually found a foothold by way of the work of three economists, [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] in England, [[Carl Menger|Menger]] in Austria, and [[Léon Walras|Walras]] in Switzerland.
[[Image:Jevons.jpeg|thumb|105px|William Stanley Jevons]]
[[William Stanley Jevons]] first proposed the theory in [http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/jevons/mathem.txt “A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy”] ([http://www.eco.utexas.edu/~hmcleave/jevonsmath.pdf PDF]), a paper presented in 1862 and published in 1863, followed by a series of works culminating in his book ''The Theory of Political Economy'' in 1871 that established his reputation as a leading political economist and logician of the time. Jevons' conception of utility was in the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] tradition of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and of [[John Stuart Mill]], but he differed from his [[classical economics|classical]] predecessors in emphasizing that "value depends entirely upon utility", in particular, on "final utility upon which the theory of Economics will be found to turn."&lt;ref&gt;W. Stanley Jevons (1871), ''The Theory of Political Economy'', p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; He later qualified this in deriving the result that in a model of exchange equilibrium, price ratios would be proportional not only to ratios of "final degrees of utility," but also to costs of production.&lt;ref&gt;W. Stanley Jevons (1879, 2nd ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=aYcBAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=jevons+%22the+theory+of+political+economy%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=IyxPG-thjm&amp;sig=ta6Vv6bIPxNZVaqyxFoGfv39Od8#PPA203,M1 ''The Theory of Political Economy''], p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Collison Brown (1987), "Jevons, William Stanley," [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 2, pp. 1008–09.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Menger]] presented the theory in [http://docs.mises.de/Menger/Menger_Grundsaetze.pdf ''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre''] (translated as [https://www.mises.org/etexts/menger/principles.asp ''Principles of Economics'']) in 1871.  Menger's presentation is peculiarly notable on two points.  First, he took special pains to explain ''why'' individuals should be expected to rank possible uses and then to use marginal utility to decide amongst trade-offs. (For this reason, Menger and his followers are sometimes called “the Psychological School”, though they are more frequently known as “the [[Austrian School]]” or as “the Vienna School”.) Second, while his illustrative examples present utility as quantified, his essential assumptions do not.&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen" /&gt; (Menger in fact crossed-out the numerical tables in his own copy of the published ''Grundsätze''.&lt;ref&gt;Kauder, Emil; ''A History of Marginal Utility Theory'' (1965), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;) Menger also developed the [[law of diminishing marginal utility]].&lt;ref name=Mises&gt;Polleit, Thorsten (2011-02-11) [https://mises.org/daily/5014/What-Can-the-Law-of-Diminishing-Marginal-Utility-Teach-Us What Can the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility Teach Us?], ''[[Mises Institute]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Menger's work found a significant and appreciative audience.

[[Léon Walras|Marie-Esprit-Léon Walras]] introduced the theory in ''Éléments d'économie politique pure'', the first part of which was published in 1874 in a relatively mathematical exposition.  Walras's work found relatively few readers at the time but was recognized and incorporated two decades later in the work of [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] and [[Enrico Barone|Barone]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald A. Walker  (1987), "Walras, Léon" ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 4, p. 862.&lt;/ref&gt;

An American, [[John Bates Clark]], is sometimes also mentioned.  But, while Clark independently arrived at a marginal utility theory, he did little to advance it until it was clear that the followers of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were revolutionizing economics.  Nonetheless, his contributions thereafter were profound.

==== The second generation ====
[[Image:Vilfredo Pareto 1870s2.jpg|thumb|105px|Vilfredo Pareto]]
Although the Marginal Revolution flowed from the work of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, their work might have failed to enter the mainstream were it not for a second generation of economists.  In England, the second generation were exemplified by [[Philip Wicksteed|Philip Henry Wicksteed]], by [[William Smart (economist)|William Smart]], and by [[Alfred Marshall]]; in Austria by [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] and by [[Friedrich von Wieser]]; in Switzerland by [[Vilfredo Pareto]]; and in America by [[Herbert Joseph Davenport]] and by [[Frank Fetter|Frank A. Fetter]].

There were significant, distinguishing features amongst the approaches of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, but the second generation did not maintain distinctions along national or linguistic lines.  The work of von Wieser was heavily influenced by that of Walras.  Wicksteed was heavily influenced by Menger.  Fetter referred to himself and Davenport as part of “the American Psychological School”, named in imitation of the Austrian “Psychological School”. (And Clark's work from this period onward similarly shows heavy influence by Menger.)  William Smart began as a conveyor of Austrian School theory to English-language readers, though he fell increasingly under the influence of Marshall.&lt;ref name="salerno"&gt;Salerno, Joseph T. 1999; “The Place of Mises’s Human Action in the Development of Modern Economic Thought.” ''Quarterly Journal of Economic Thought'' v. 2 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Böhm-Bawerk was perhaps the most able expositor of Menger's conception.&lt;ref name="salerno" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von. “Grundzüge der Theorie des wirtschaftlichen Güterwerthes”, ''Jahrbüche für Nationalökonomie und Statistik'' v 13 (1886).  Translated as ''Basic Principles of Economic Value''.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was further noted for producing a theory of interest and of profit in equilibrium based upon the interaction of diminishing marginal utility with diminishing [[marginal product]]ivity of time and with [[time preference]].&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von; ''Kapital Und Kapitalizns. Zweite Abteilung: Positive Theorie des Kapitales'' (1889). Translated as ''Capital and Interest. II: Positive Theory of Capital'' with appendices rendered as ''Further Essays on Capital and Interest''.&lt;/ref&gt; (This theory was adopted in full and then further developed by [[Knut Wicksell]]&lt;ref&gt;Wicksell, Johan Gustaf Knut; ''Über Wert, Kapital unde Rente'' (1893). Translated as [https://www.mises.org/books/valuecapital.pdf ''Value, Capital and Rent''.]&lt;/ref&gt; and, with modifications including formal disregard for time-preference, by Wicksell's American rival [[Irving Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Irving; ''Theory of Interest'' (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;)

Marshall was the second-generation marginalist whose work on marginal utility came most to inform the mainstream of neoclassical economics, especially by way of his ''Principles of Economics'', the first volume of which was published in 1890.  Marshall constructed the demand curve with the aid of assumptions that utility was quantified, and that the marginal utility of money was constant (or nearly so).  Like Jevons, Marshall did not see an explanation for supply in the theory of marginal utility, so he synthesized an explanation of demand thus explained with supply explained in a more [[Classical economics|classical]] manner, determined by costs which were taken to be objectively determined.  (Marshall later actively mischaracterized the criticism that these costs were themselves ultimately determined by marginal utilities.&lt;ref name="schumMarshScis"&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph Alois; ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954) Pt IV Ch 6 §4.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==== The Marginal Revolution and Marxism ====
[[Karl Marx]] acknowledged that "nothing can have value, without being an object of utility",&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl Heinrich; ''Capital'' V1 Ch 1 §1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl Heinrich; [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/f239-289.htm ''Grundrisse''] (completed in 1857 though not published until much later)&lt;/ref&gt; but, in his analysis, "use-value as such lies outside the sphere of investigation of political economy",&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl Heinrich]]: ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy''] (1859), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; with labor being the principal determinant of value under capitalism.

The doctrines of marginalism and the Marginal Revolution are often interpreted as somehow a response to [[Marxism|Marxist economics]]. However the first volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' was not published until July 1867, after the works of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were written or well under way (In 1874 Walras published Éléments d'économie politique pure and Carl Menger published Principles of Economics in 1871) ; and Marx was still a relatively minor figure when these works were completed. It is unlikely that any of them knew anything of him. (On the other hand, [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] or [[William Warren Bartley|Bartley]] has suggested that Marx, voraciously reading at the [[British Museum]], may have come across the works of one or more of these figures, and that his inability to formulate a viable critique may account for his failure to complete any further volumes of ''Kapital'' before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, Friedrich August von, with [[William Warren Bartley|William Warren Bartley III]]; ''The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism'' (1988) p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Nonetheless, it is not unreasonable to suggest that the generation who followed the preceptors of the Revolution succeeded partly because they could formulate straightforward responses to Marxist economic theory. The most famous of these was that of Böhm-Bawerk, ''Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems'' (1896),&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von: "''Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems''" &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;"On the Closure of the Marxist System"&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, ''Staatswiss. Arbeiten. Festgabe für [[Karl Knies|K. Knies]]'' (1896).&lt;/ref&gt; but the first was Wicksteed's "The Marxian Theory of Value. ''Das Kapital'': a criticism" (1884,&lt;ref&gt;Wicksteed, Philip Henry; "Das Kapital: A Criticism", ''To-day'' 2 (1884) pp. 388–409.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by "The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder" in 1885&lt;ref&gt;Wicksteed, Philip Henry; "The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder", ''To-day'' 3 (1885) pp. 177–79.&lt;/ref&gt;). Initially there were only a few Marxist responses to marginalism, of which the most famous were [[Rudolf Hilferding]]'s ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' (1904)&lt;ref&gt;Hilferding, Rudolf: ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' (1904). Translated as ''Böhm-Bawerk's Criticism of Marx''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Politicheskoy ekonomni rante'' (1914) by [[Nikolai Bukharin|Никола́й Ива́нович Буха́рин (Nikolai Bukharin)]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Bukharin|Буха́рин, Никола́й Ива́нович (Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin)]]; ''Политической экономии рантье'' (1914). Translated as [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1927/leisure-economics/ ''The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class''].&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the course of the 20th century a considerable literature developed on the conflict between marginalism and the labour theory of value, with the work of the neo-Ricardian economist [[Piero Sraffa]] providing an important critique of marginalism.

It might also be noted that some followers of [[Henry George]] similarly consider marginalism and neoclassical economics a reaction to ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', which was published in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mason Gaffney|Gaffney, Mason]], and Fred Harrison: ''The Corruption of Economics'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s [[John Roemer]] and other [[Analytical Marxism#Exploitation|analytical Marxists]] have worked to rebuild Marxian theses on a marginalist foundation.

=== Reformulation ===
In his 1881 work [http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/edgeworth/mathpsychics.pdf ''Mathematical Psychics''], [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] presented the [[indifference curve]], deriving its properties from marginalist theory which assumed utility to be a differentiable function of quantified goods and services. Later work attempted to generalize to the indifference curve formulations of utility and marginal utility in avoiding unobservable measures of utility.

In 1915, [[Eugen Slutsky]] derived a theory of consumer choice solely from properties of indifference curves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Slutsky|Слуцкий, Евгений Евгениевич (Slutsky, Yevgyeniy Ye.)]]; "Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore", ''Giornale degli Economisti'' 51 (1915).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of [[World War I|the World War]], the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], and his own subsequent loss of interest, Slutsky's work drew almost no notice, but similar work in 1934 by [[John Hicks|John Richard Hicks]] and [[R. G. D. Allen]]&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, John Richard, and Roy George Douglas Allen; "A Reconsideration of the Theory of Value", ''Economica'' 54 (1934).&lt;/ref&gt; derived much the same results and found a significant audience. (Allen subsequently drew attention to Slutsky's earlier accomplishment.)

Although some of the third generation of Austrian School economists had by 1911 rejected the quantification of utility while continuing to think in terms of marginal utility,&lt;ref name="mises" /&gt; most economists presumed that utility must be a sort of quantity. Indifference curve analysis seemed to represent a way to dispense with presumptions of quantification, albeit that a seemingly arbitrary assumption (admitted by Hicks to be a "rabbit out of a hat"&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. 2"Utility and Preference" §8, p. 23 in the 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;) about decreasing marginal rates of substitution&lt;ref name="hicks_vc"&gt;Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. "Utility and Preference" §7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; would then have to be introduced to have convexity of indifference curves.

For those who accepted that indifference curve analysis superseded earlier marginal utility analysis, the latter became at best perhaps pedagogically useful, but "old fashioned" and observationally unnecessary.&lt;ref name="hicks_vc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="samuelson"&gt;Samuelson, Paul Anthony; "Complementarity: An Essay on the 40th Anniversary of the Hicks-Allen Revolution in Demand Theory", ''Journal of Economic Literature'' vol 12 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revival ===
[[Image:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif|thumb|105px|[[John von Neumann]]]]
When Cramer and Bernoulli introduced the notion of diminishing marginal utility, it had been to address [[St. Petersburg paradox|a paradox of gambling]], rather than the [[paradox of value]].  The marginalists of the revolution, however, had been formally concerned with problems in which there was neither [[risk]] nor [[uncertainty]].  So too with the indifference curve analysis of Slutsky, Hicks, and Allen.

The [[expected utility hypothesis]] of Bernoulli and others was revived by various 20th century thinkers, with early contributions by [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] (1926),&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Frank Plumpton; "Truth and Probability" ([http://cepa.newschool.edu/het//texts/ramsey/ramsess.pdf  PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227205205/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het//texts/ramsey/ramsess.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}), Chapter VII in ''The Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays'' (1931).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]] (1944),&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, John and Oskar Morgenstern; ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Savage]] (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Leonard Jimmie: ''Foundations of Statistics'' (1954).&lt;/ref&gt; Although this hypothesis remains controversial, it brings not only utility, but a quantified conception of utility (cardinal utility), back into the mainstream of economic thought.

A major reason why quantified models of utility are influential today is that risk and uncertainty have been recognized as central topics in contemporary economic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Peter, and Michael Rothschild, eds.: ''Uncertainty in Economics'' (1989). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Quantified utility models simplify the analysis of risky decisions because, under quantified utility, diminishing marginal utility implies [[risk aversion]].&lt;ref&gt;Demange, Gabriel, and Guy Laroque: ''Finance and the Economics of Uncertainty'' (2006), Ch. 3, pp. 71–72. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many contemporary analyses of saving and portfolio choice require stronger assumptions than diminishing marginal utility, such as the assumption of [[Prudence#Prudence in economics and finance|prudence]], which means [[convex function|convex]] marginal utility.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Miles (1990), "Precautionary Saving in the Small and in the Large", ''[[Econometrica]]'', 58 (1) pp. 53–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Austrian School continued to develop its ordinalist notions of marginal utility analysis, formally demonstrating that from them proceed the decreasing marginal rates of substitution of indifference curves.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;

'''''Modernism/modernity''''' is a quarterly [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] established in 1994 by Lawrence Rainey and Robert van Hallberg. It covers methodological, archival, and theoretical approaches to [[Modernism|modernist studies]] in the long modernist period. Since 2001 it has been the official publication of the [[Modernist Studies Association]].

In February 2014, the journal started operating with two editorial offices: a permanent MSA office and a permanent office at the University of York. It is published quarterly in January, April, September, and November by [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]. The journal is also available in digital form through library databases such as [[Project Muse]].

Each issue includes a section of thematic essays, multi-work review essays, individual [[book review]]s, and a list of "recent books of interest." The journal occasionally has guest-edited or special issues, with a series of related essays on one topic. The journal has also launched an "Out of the Archives" series, in which out-of-print and neglected works of [[modernism]] are reintroduced to its readership.

The current [[editors-in-chief]] are Debra Rae Cohen ([[University of South Carolina]]) and Christopher Bush ([[Northwestern University]]). Previous editors include Ann Ardis ([[University of Delaware]]), Cassandra Laity ([[Drew University]]), and [[Jeffrey Schnapp]] ([[Harvard University]]).

In 2003, ''Modernism/modernity'' won the Phoenix Award from the [[Council of Editors of Learned Journals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celj.org/phoenix The Phoenix Award for Significant Editorial Achievement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620041839/http://www.celj.org/phoenix |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[literature]], '''mood''' is the atmosphere of the narrative.  Mood is created by means of [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] (locale and surroundings in which the [[narrative]] takes place), [[Tone (literature)|attitude]] (of the narrator and of the [[Character (arts)|characters]] in the narrative), and [[description]]s.  Though atmosphere and setting are connected, they may be considered separately to a degree.  Atmosphere is the aura of mood that surrounds the story.  It is to [[fiction]] what the sensory level is to [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1999|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mood is established in order to affect the reader emotionally and psychologically and to provide a feeling for the narrative.

==Elements==
Mood is generally created through several different things.
Setting, which provides the physical location of the story, is used in order to create a background in which the story takes place. Different settings can affect the mood of a story differently, and usually supports or conflicts with the other content of the story in some way. For example, the desert may be a setting for a [[cowboy]] story, and may generate a mood of solitude, desolation, and struggle, among other possible associations.
The attitude of the [[narrator]] is another element that helps generate mood. As the reader is dependent on the narrator's perspective of the story, they see the story through their lenses, feeling the way the narrator feels about what happens or what is being described. Embedded in the attitude of a narrator are the feelings and emotions which make it up. A similar element that goes into generating mood is [[diction]], that is, the choice and style of words the writer uses. Diction conveys a sensibility as well as portrays the content of a story in specific colors, thus affecting the way the reader feels about it.

==Difference from tone== 
[[Tone (literature)|Tone]] and mood are not the same. The tone of a piece of literature is the speaker's or narrator's attitude towards the subject, rather than what the reader feels, as in mood. Mood is the general feeling or atmosphere that a piece of writing creates within the reader.  Mood is produced most effectively through the use of setting, theme, [[Writer's voice|voice]] and tone. Tone can indicate the narrator's mood, but the overall mood comes from the totality of the written work, even in [[first-person narrative]]s. The effect a literary work has upon the reader is subjective and produces different associations, while the text made by the author is presented to the reader as an objective thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-literature.org/essays/reader-response.php |title=The Author, the Text, and the Reader  |last=Lee Ai Ling |first=Clarissa |publisher=London School of Journalism |date=October 2002|website=English Literature |access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mood is suggested by the elements utilized by the author, but relies on the subjective response from the reader.

'''Neo-Vedanta''', also called '''Hindu modernism''',{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} '''neo-Hinduism''',{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} '''Global Hinduism'''{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=265}} and '''Hindu Universalism''',&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/2012/02/15/neo-vedanta-the-problem-with-hindu-universalism-frank-gaetano-morales/ Frank Morales, ''Neo-Vedanta: The problem with Hindu Universalism'']&lt;/ref&gt; are terms to characterize interpretations of [[Hinduism]] that developed in the 19th century. Some scholars argue that these modern interpretations incorporate western ideas{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} into traditional Indian religions, especially [[Advaita Vedanta]], which is asserted as central or fundamental to [[Hindu culture]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}

The term "Neo-Vedanta" was coined by Paul Hacker, in a somewhat pejorative way, to disntinguish modern developments from "traditional" Advaita Vedanta.{{sfn|Madaio|2017}} Other scholars have pointed out that a '''Greater Advaita Vedānta'''{{sfn|Madaio|2017}}{{refn|group=note|Madaio refers to Allen, Michael S. 2013. The Ocean of Inquiry: A Neglected Classic of Late Advaita Vedānta. Ph.D. dissertation, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.}} developed since medieaval times, in the Muslim period of India, when Hindus responded to Muslim rule and domination.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} When Muslim rule was replaced by British rule, Hindu religious and political leaders and thinkers responded to this western [[colonialism]] and [[orientalism]], contributing to the [[Indian freedom struggle]] and the modern national and religious identity of [[Hindu]]s in the [[Republic of India]]. This societal aspect is covered under the term of [[Hindu reform movements]].

Among the main proponents of such modern interpretations of Hinduism were [[Vivekananda]], [[Aurobindo]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]], who to some extent also contributed to the emergence of [[Neo-Hindu movements in the West]].

Neo-Vedanta has been influential in the perception of Hinduism, both in the west and in the higher educated classes in India. It has received appraisal for its "solution of synthesis",{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=320}} but has also been criticised for its Universalism. The terms "Neo-Hindu" or "Neo-Vedanta" themselves have also been criticised for its polemical usage, the prefix "Neo-" then intended to imply that these modern interpretations of Hinduism are "inauthentic" or in other ways problematic.{{sfn|Halbfass|2007b|p=587}}

==Definition and etymology==
According to Halbfass, the terms "Neo-Vedanta" and "Neo-Hinduism" refer to "the adoption of Western concepts and standards and the readiness to reinterpret traditional ideas in light of these new, imported and imposed modes of thought".{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} Promiment in Neo-Vedanta is Vivekananda, who's theology, according to Madaio, is often characterised in earlier scholarship as "a rupture from 'traditional' or 'classical' Hindusim, particularly the 'orthodox' Advaita Vedanta of the eight century Samkara."{{sfn|Madaio|2017|p=2}}

The term "Neo-Vedanta" appears to have arisen in Bengal in the 19th century, where it was used by both Indians and Europeans.{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} According to [[Wilhelm Halbfass|Halbfass]] the term was invented by a Bengali, [[Brajendra Nath Seal]] (1864–1938), who used the term to characterise the literary work of [[Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]] (1838–1894).{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}}

The term "neo-Vedanta" was used by Christian missionaries as well as Hindu traditionalists to criticize the emerging ideas of the [[Brahmo Samaj]], a critical usage whose "polemical undertone [...] is obvious".{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=9,21(n33)}}

The term "neo-Hinduism" was used by a Jesuit scholar resident in India, [[Robert Antoine]] (1914–1981), from whom it was borrowed by Paul Hacker, who used it to demarcate these modernist ideas from "surviving traditional Hinduism,"{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} and treating the Neo-Advaitins as "dialogue partners with a broken identity who cannot truly and authentically speak for themselves and for the Indian tradition".{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=9}} Hacker made a distinction between "Neo-Vedanta" and "neo-Hinduism",{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} seeing nationalism as a prime concern of "neo-Hinduism".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=194}}

==History==
Although neo-Vedanta proper developed in the 19th century in response to western colonialism, it has got deeper origins in the Muslim period of India.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}

===Islamic rule – Unifying Hinduism===
{{main article|Unifying Hinduism}}
With the onset of Islamic rule, hierarchical classifications of the various orthodox schools were developed to defend Hinduism against Islamic influences.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} According to Nicholson, already between the twelfth and the sixteenth century,
{{quote|... certain thinkers began to treat as a single whole the diverse philosophical teachings of the Upanishads, epics, Puranas, and the schools known retrospectively as the "six systems" (''saddarsana'') of mainstream Hindu philosophy.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=2}}}}

The tendency of "a blurring of philosophical distinctions"  has also been noted by Burley.{{sfn|Burley|2007|p=34}} Lorenzen locates the origins of a distinct Hindu identity in the interaction between Muslims and Hindus,{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=24-33}} and a process of "mutual self-definition with a contrasting Muslim other",{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=27}} which started well before 1800.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=26-27}} Both the Indian and the European thinkers who developed the term "Hinduism" in the 19th century were influenced by these philosophers.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=2}}

Within these so-called ''[[Doxology|doxologies]]'' Advaita Vedanta was given the highest position, since it was regarded to be most inclusive system.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} [[Vijnanabhiksu]], a 16th-century philosopher and writer, is still an influential representant of these doxologies. He's been a prime influence on 19th century Hindu modernists like Vivekananda, who also tried to integrate various strands of Hindu thought, taking Advaita Vedanta as its most representative specimen.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}

===Western colonialism and Hindu reform movements===
{{See also|Orientalism|Hindu nationalism|Hindu reform movements}}

====Western colonialism====
With the colonisation of India by the British, a darker era in the history of India began. Prior to this, Muslim rule over North India had had a drastic effect on [[Hinduism]] (and [[Buddhism]]) through systematic [[Persecution of Hindus#Persecution by Muslim Rulers|persecution]]. While the Indian society was greatly impacted, its [[Economic history of India|economy]] however continued to remain one of the largest in the World.{{sfn|Maddison|2006}} Muslim rule over Southern India was also relatively short-lived before the 17th century. In contrast to the Muslim rulers, the British actively engaged in destroying the Indian economy as well.{{sfn|Maddison|2006}}{{sfn|Dharampal|1971}} The economic destruction wrought by restrictive British policies and [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial revolution]] in Europe, led to the dismantling of the prevailing decentralized education systems in India in the 18th century.{{sfn|Dharampal|1971}} The British state-supported education system, after the [[English Education Act 1835|English Education Act]] of 1835, emphasized western religions and thoughts at the cost of indigenous ones.

The British also nurtured and were involved, post 1813, in the aggressive propagation of [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]].{{sfn|King|2002}} This was concomitant with the British [[Political warfare in British colonial India|propaganda]] machine's involvement in the spreading [[Anti-Indian sentiment#Colonialists|anti-Hindu]] sentiments.

====Hindu reform movements====
In response to the British rule and cultural dominance, [[Hindu reform movements]] developed,{{sfn|Michaels|2004}} propagating societal and religious reforms, exemplifying what [[Percival Spear]] has called
{{quote|... the 'solution of synthesis'—the effort to adapt to the newcomers, in the process of which innovation and assimilation gradually occur, alongside an ongoing agenda to preserve the unique values of the many traditions of Hinduism (and other religious traditions as well).{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=319-320}}{{refn|group=note|[[Percival Spear]] (1958), ''India, Pakistan and the West'', pp 177–91. In :{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=319-320}} "Spear develops a typology of behavioral responses that appeared among the people of India with the coming of the British. This typology is to some degree still relevant for formulating how Indic religion and philosophy may begin to play an innovative role in the intellectual discourses
of our time. Spear identifies five types of distinctive responses:
# a "military" or openly hostile response—taking up arms against the intruders;
# a "reactionary" response—the attempt to reconstitute the older political order, for example, the North Indian Rebellion (formerly called the "mutiny") in 1857–58;
# a "westernizing" response—assimilating to the new values;
# an "orthodox" response—maintenance of the older religion with appropriate reform; and
# the "solution of synthesis"—the effort to adapt to the newcomers, in the process of which innovation and assimilation gradually occur, alongside an ongoing agenda to preserve the unique values of the many traditions of Hinduism (and other religious traditions as well)."}}}}

Neo-Vedanta, also called "neo-Hinduism"{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} is a central theme in these reform-movements.{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} The earliest of these reform-movements was Ram Mohan Roy's [[Brahmo Samaj]], who strived toward a purified and monotheistic Hinduism.{{sfn|Michelis|2005}}

==Major proponents==
Neo-vedanta's main proponents are the leaders of the Brahmo Samaj, especially [[Ram Mohan Roy]],{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=190-192}} while [[Vivekananda]], [[Gandhi]], [[Aurobindo]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] are the main proponents of neo-Hinduism.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=194}}

===Ram Mohan Roy and the Brahmo Samaj===
{{Main article|Ram Mohan Roy|Brahmo Samaj|Brahmoism}}

The Brahmo Samaj was the first of the 19th century reform movements. Its founder, Ram Mohan Roy (1772–1833), strived toward an [[Universalism|universalistic]] interpretation of Hinduism.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=46}} He rejected Hindu mythology, but also the Christian trinity.{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}} He found that [[Unitarianism]] came closest to true Christianity,{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}} and had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians.{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=3}} He founded a missionary committee in Calcutta, and in 1828 asked for support for missionary activities from the American Unitarians.{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=7-8}} By 1829, Roy had abandoned the Unitarian Committee,{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=15}} but after Roy's death, the Brahmo Samaj kept close ties to the Unitarian Church,{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268-269}} who strived towards a rational faith, social reform, and the joining of these two in a renewed religion.{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=3}} The Unitarians were closely connected to the [[Transcendentalists]], who were interested in and influenced by Indian religions early on.{{sfn|Versluis|1993}}

Rammohan Roy's ideas were "altered ... considerably" by [[Debendranath Tagore]], who had a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] approach to the development of these new doctrines, and questioned central Hindu beliefs like reincarnation and karma, and rejected the authority of the ''Vedas''.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=46-47}} Tagore also brought this "neo-Hinduism" closer in line with western [[esotericism]], a development which was furthered by Keshubchandra Sen.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=47}} Sen was influencded by [[Transcendentalism]], an American philosophical-religious movement stringly connected with Unitarianism, which emphasized personal [[religious experience]] over mere reasoning and theology.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=81}} Sen strived to "an accessible, non-renunciatory, everyman type of spirituality", introducing "lay systems of spiritual practice" which can be regarded as proto-types of the kind of Yoga-exercises which Vivekananda populurized in the west.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=49}}

The theology of the Brahmo Samaj was called "neo-Vedanta" by Christian commentators,{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=9}}{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=192}} who "partly admired [the Brahmos] for their courage in abandoning traditions of polytheism and image worship, but whom they also scorned for having proffered to other Hindus a viable alternative to conversion".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=192}} Critics accused classical Vedanta of being "cosmic self-infatuation" and "ethical nihilism".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=192}} Brahmo Samaj leaders responded to such attacks by redefining the Hindu path to liberation, making the Hindu path available to both genders and all castes,{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=192}} incorporating "notions of democracy and worldly improvement".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=193}}

===Vivekananda (1863–1902)===
{{Main article|Swami Vivekananda|Ramakrishna Mission}}

According to Gavin Flood, Vivekananda (1863–1902){{sfn|Flood|1996|p=257}} (Narendranath Dutta) "is a figure of great importance in the development of a modern Hindu self-understanding and in formulating the West's view of Hinduism".{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=257}} He played a major role in the [[Hindu reform movements|revival of Hinduism]],{{sfn|Dense|1999|p=191}} and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the west via the [[Ramakrishna Mission]].{{refn|group=note|His interpretation of Advaita Vedanta has been called "Neo-Vedanta".{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}}}

In 1880 Vivekananda joined [[Keshub Chandra Sen]]'s ''[[Nava Vidhan]]'', which was established by Sen after meeting [[Ramakrishna]] and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}} Narendranath (a.k.a. Narendra) became a member of a [[Freemasonry]] lodge "at some point before 1884"{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=100}} and of the [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]] in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] led by [[Keshub Chandra Sen]] and [[Debendranath Tagore]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}}{{sfn| Sen|2006|pp=12–14}}{{sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=8}}{{sfn|Badrinath|2006|p=20}} From 1881 to 1884 he was also active in Sen's [[Band of Hope]], which tried to discourage the youth from smoking and drinking.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}} It was in this [[cult]]ic{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=31-35}} milieu that Narendra became acquainted with western [[esotericism]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=19-90, 97-100}} His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which included belief in a formless God and the deprecation of [[idolatry]],{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=5}}{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=29}} and a "streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the ''Upanisads'' and of the Vedanta".{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=46}} He propagated the idea that "the divine, the absolute, exists within all human beings regardless of social status",{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} and that "seeing the divine as the essence of others will promote love and social harmony".{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}}

During this period, he came in contact with [[Ramakrishna]], who eventually became his guru, and fitted into his broadening views on spirituality and liberation.

Vivekananda's acquaintance with western esotericism made him very successful in western esoteric circles, beginning with his speech in 1893 at the Parliament of Religions. Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements like [[Transcendentalism]] and [[New thought]].{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=119-123}} An important element in his adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his four yoga's model, which includes [[Raja yoga]], his interpretation of Patanjali's [[Yoga sutras]],{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=123-126}} which offered a practical means to realize the divine force within which is central to modern western esotericism.{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=119-123}} In 1896 his book ''[[Raja Yoga (book)|Raja Yoga]]'' was published, which became an instant success and was highly influential in the western understanding of Yoga.{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=125-126}}{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=149-180}}

In line with Advaita vedanta texts like ''[[Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka]]'' (14th century) and ''[[Vedantasara (of Sadananda)]]'' (15th century), Vivekananda saw [[samadhi]] as a means to attain liberation.{{sfn|Comans|1993}}

===Gandhi===
{{Main article|Mahatma Gandhi}}

Gandhi (1869–1948) has become a worldwide hero of tolerance and striving toward freedom. In his own time, he objected to the growing forces of [[Indian nationalism]], [[communalism]] and the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] response.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=8-10}}{{refn|group=note|"Subaltern" is the social group who is socially, politically, and geographically outside of the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[Hierarchy|power structure]] of a country. In the Indian colonial and post-colonial context this entails the hegemony of upper-class visions on Indian history, such as the ''Vedic'' origins of Hinduism, and the alternative visions{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=9}} such as [[Dravidian nationalism]] and the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]].}} Gandhi saw religion as an uniting force, confessing the equality of all religions.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=10}} He synthesized the ''[[Astika]]'', ''Nastika'' and ''Semitic religions'', promoting an inclusive culture for peaceful living.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=10}} Gandhi pled for a new hermeneutics of Indian scriptures and philosophy, observing that "there are ample religious literature both in ''Astika'' and ''Nastika'' religions supporting for a pluralistic approach to religious and cultural diversity".{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=10}}

The orthodox Advaita Vedanta, and the heterodox Jain concept [[Anekantavada]] provided him concepts for an "integral approach to religious pluralism".{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=10}} He regarded Advaita as a universal religion ("dharma"{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}}) which could unite both the orthodox and nationalistic religious interpretations, as the subaltern alternatives.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} Hereby Gandhi offers an interpretation of ''Hindutva'' which is basically different from the ''[[Sangh Parivar]]''-interpretation.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} The concept of ''anekantavada'' offered Gandhi an axiom that "truth is many-sided and relative".{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} It is "a methodology to counter exclusivism or absolutism propounded by many religious interpretations".{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} It has the capability of synthesizing different percpetions of reality.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} In Gandhi's view,
{{quote|...the spirit of 'Synthesis' essentially dominated Indian civilization. This spirit is absorption, assimilation, co-existence and synthesis.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}}}}

Anekantavada also gives room to an organic understanding of "spatio-temporal process",{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} that is, the daily world and its continued change.{{refn|group=note|Compare Gier (2012), who pleads for a [[Process philosophy|process-philosophy]] instead of a [[Substance theory|substance-philosophy]].{{sfn|Gier|2012}}}} The doctrine of anekantavada is a plea for ''samvada'', "dialogue", and an objection against proselytizing activities.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}}

===Sarvepalli Radhakrisnan===
{{Main article|Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan}}

Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was a major force in the further popularization of Neo-Vedanta.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=194-196}} As a schoolboy, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was inspired by Vivekananda's lectures, in which he found "an ennobling vision of truth and harmony as well as a message of Indian pride".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=194}} He was educated by Christian missionaries, and wrote a master thesis on Vedanta and ethics.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}} In later life, he became vice-president and president of India.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}} According to Rinehart, he presented his view of Hinduism as ''the'' view of Hinduism.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}} Central in his presentation was the claim that religion is fundamentally a kind of experience,{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}} ''anubhava'',&lt;ref group=web name="IEP-Radhakrishnan"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/radhakri/#SH3b Michael Hawley, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan'']&lt;/ref&gt; reducing religion "to the core experience of reality in its fundamental unity".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}}{{refn|group=note|The notion of "religious experience" can be traced back to [[William James]], who used the term "religious experience" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p = 47}} [[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" further back to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular citique.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} The term was popularised by the [[Transcendentalists]], and exported to Asia via missionaries.{{sfn|King|2002}} It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p = 271}}}} For Radhakrishnan, Vedanta was the essence and bedrock of religion.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196}}

===Religion===

====Unity of Hinduism====
Neo-Vedanta aims to present Hinduism as a "homogenized ideal of Hinduism"{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338}} with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine.{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} It presents
{{quote|... an imagined "integral unity" that was probably little more than an "imagined" view of the religious life that pertained only to a cultural elite and that empirically speaking had very little reality "on the ground," as it were, throughout the centuries of cultural development in the South Asian region.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}}}}

Neo-Vedanta was influenced by Oriental scholarship, which portrayed Hinduism as a "single world religion",{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} and denigrated the heterogeneousity of Hindu beliefs and practices as 'distortions' of the basic teachings of Vedanta.{{sfn|King|1999|p=135}}{{refn|group=note|The same tendency to prefer an essential core teaching has been prevalent in western scholarship of Theravada Buddhism,{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and has also been constructed by D.T.

====Universalism====
{{Main article|Universalism}}
{{expand section|date=September 2015}}

Following Ramakrishna, neo-Vedanta regards all religions to be equal paths to liberation, but also gives a special place to Hinduism, as the ultimate universal religion.

====Vedanta and nondualism====
{{Main article|Nondualism}}

According to Benavides, neo-Vedanta is closer to Ramanuja's [[Vishishtadvaita|qualified non-dualism]] than it is to Shankara Advaita Vedanta.{{sfn|Benavides|1993}} Nicholas F. Gier notes that neo-Vedanta does not regard the world to be illusionary, in contrast to Shankara's Advaita.{{sfn|Gier|2012|p=268-269}}{{refn|group=note|Gier: "Ramakrsna, Svami Vivekananda, and Aurobindo (I also include M.K.

According to Michael Taft, Ramakrishna reconciled the dualism of formless and form.{{sfn|Taft|2014}} Ramakrishna regarded the Supreme Being to be both Personal and Impersonal, active and inactive.&lt;ref group=web name="GM" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Ramakrishna: "When I think of the Supreme Being as inactive - neither creating nor preserving nor destroying - I call Him Brahman or Purusha, the Impersonal God.

The Personal and Impersonal are the same thing, like milk and its whiteness, the diamond and its lustre, the snake and its wriggling motion. It is impossible to conceive of the one without the other.

The Neo-Vedanta is also Advaitic inasmuch as it holds that Brahman, the Ultimate Reality, is one without a second, ''ekamevadvitiyam''. But as distinguished from the traditional Advaita of Sankara, it is a synthetic Vedanta which reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism and also other theories of reality. In this sense it may also be called concrete monism in so far as it holds that Brahman is both qualified, saguna, and qualityless, nirguna (Chatterjee, 1963 : 260)."{{sfn|Sooklal|1993|p=33}}}}

Radhakrishnan acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the absolute or Brahman.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Neo-Vedanta|Neo-Vedanta seems to be closer to [[Bhedabheda|Bhedabheda-Vedanta]] than to Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, with the acknowledgement of the reality of the world.

Gandhi endorsed the Jain concept of [[Anekantavada]],{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=190-191}} the notion that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth.{{sfn|Dundas|2004|p=123–136}}{{sfn|Koller|2004|p=400–407}} This concept embraces the perspectives of both Vedānta which, according to Jainism, "recognizes [[Substance theory|substances]] but not process", and Buddhism, which "recognizes [[Process philosophy|process]] but not substance". Jainism, on the other hand, pays equal attention to both substance (''dravya'') and process (''paryaya'').{{sfn|Burch|1964|p=68–93}}

According to Sarma, who stands in the tradition of [[Nisargadatta Maharaj]], Advaitavāda means "spiritual non-dualism or absolutism",{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=1}} in which opposites are ''manifestations'' of the Absolute, which itself is immanent and transcendent.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=1-2}}{{refn|group=note|Sarma: "All opposites like being and non-being, life and death, good and evil, light and darkness, gods and men, soul and nature are viewed as manifestations of the Absolute which is immanent in the universe and yet transcends it."{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=1-2}}}}

====''Sruti'' versus "experience"====

A central concern in Neo-Vedanta is the role of ''[[sruti]]'', sacred texts, versus (personal) experience. Classical Advaita Vedanta is centered on the correct understanding of ''sruti'', the sacred texts. Correct understanding of the ''sruti'' is a ''pramana'', a means of knowledge to attain liberation.{{sfn|Myers|2013|p=104-105}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1984}}{{sfn|Dalal|2009|p=22}} It takes years of preparation and study to accomplish this task, and includes the mastery of Sanskrit, the memorisation of texts, and the meditation over the interpretation of those texts.{{sfn|Dubois|2013}} Understanding is called ''[[anubhava]]'',{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|p=5}} knowledge or understanding derived from (personal) experience.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?p.0:100.apte V.S.Apte, ''The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary]}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Myers|2013|p=105}} ''Anubhava'' removes ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]]'', ignorance, regarding Brahman and Atman, and leads to ''[[moksha]]'', liberation. In neo-Vedanta, the status of ''sruti'' becomes secondary, and [[religious experience|"personal experience"]] itself becomes the primary means to liberation.{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|p=1-14}}

==Smarta Tradition==
{{Main article|Smarta Tradition}}

According to Ninian Smart, Neo-Vedanta is "largely a smarta account."{{sfn|Smart|2009|p=186}} In modern times Smarta-views have been highly influential in both the Indian{{sfn|Smart|2009|p=186}}&lt;ref group=web name="iskon-smarta"&gt;[http://hinduism.iskcon.org/tradition/1204.htm iskcon.org, ''Heart of Hinduism: The Smarta Tradition''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113092719/http://hinduism.iskcon.org/tradition/1204.htm |date=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and western&lt;ref group=web name="hinduism-guide.com-Hinduism"&gt;[http://www.hinduism-guide.com/hinduism/hinduism.htm Hinduism-guide.com, ''Hinduism'']&lt;/ref&gt; understanding of Hinduism. According to iskcon.org, 
{{quote|Many Hindus may not strictly identify themselves as Smartas but, by adhering to Advaita Vedanta as a foundation for non-sectarianism, are indirect followers.&lt;ref group=web name="iskon-smarta" /&gt;}}

Vaitheespara notes adherence of Smartha Brahmans to "the pan-Indian Sanskrit-Brahmanical tradition":{{sfn|Vaitheespara|2010|p=91}}
{{quote|The emerging pan-Indian nationalism was clearly founded upon a number of cultural movements that, for the most part, reimagined an 'Aryo-centric', neo-brahmanical vision of India, which provided the 'ideology' for this hegemonic project.

The majority of members of Smarta community follow the Advaita Vedanta philosophy of Shankara.&lt;ref group=web name="Hinduism-guide.com-smarta" /&gt; Smarta and Advaita have become almost synonymous, though not all Advaitins are Smartas.&lt;ref group=web name="Hinduism-guide.com-smarta" /&gt; [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] was a Smarta,&lt;ref group=web name="Hinduism-guide.com-smarta"&gt;[http://www.hinduism-guide.com/hinduism/smarta.htm Hinduism-guide.com, ''Hinduism: Details about "Smarta"'']&lt;/ref&gt; just like [[Radhakrishnan]].{{sfn|Fort|1998|p=179}}{{sfn|Minor|1987|p=3}} Smartas believe in the essential oneness of five ([[panchadeva]]) or six ([[Shanmata]] deities as personifications of the Supreme.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} According to Smartism, supreme reality, Brahman, transcends all of the various forms of personal deity.{{sfn|Espin|2007|p=563}} God is both [[Saguna brahman|Saguna]] and [[Nirguna Brahman|Nirguna]]:&lt;ref group=web name="WiseGeek" /&gt;

Lola Williamson further notes that "what is called Vedic in the smarta tradition, and in much of Hinduism, is essentially Tantric in its range of deities and liturgical forms."{{sfn|Williamson|2010|p=89}}

==Influence==
Neo-Vedanta was popularised in the 20th century in both India and the west by [[Vivekananda]],{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81}}{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]],{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} and western orientalists who regarded Vedanta to be the "central theology of Hinduism".{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}

===Vedanticization===
Neo-Vedanta has become a broad current in Indian culture,{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} extending far beyond the [[Dashanami Sampradaya]], the Advaita Vedanta [[Sampradaya]] founded by [[Adi Shankara]]. The influence of Neo-Vedanta on Indian culture has been called "Vedanticization" by [[Richard E. King|Richard King]].{{sfn|King|2011|p=69}}

An example of this "Vedanticization" is [[Ramana Maharshi]], who is regarded as one of the greatest Hindu-saints of modern times,{{refn|group=note|A comparable change of reception can be seen in the status of [[Meister Eckhart]], who has come to be celebrated the most noted western mystic.}}, of whom Sharma notes that "among all the major figures of modern Hinduism [he] is the one person who is widely regarded as a ''[[jivanmukti]]''".{{sfn|Sharma|2005|p=208}} Although Sharma admits that Ramana was not acquainted with Advaita Vedanta before his personal experience of liberation,{{sfn|Sharma|2005|p=213}} and Ramana never received [[Diksha|initiation]] into the [[Dashanami Sampradaya]] or any other [[sampradaya]],&lt;ref group=web name="jd6"&gt;[http://davidgodman.org/rteach/jd6.shtml John David, ''An Introduction to Sri Ramana's Life and Teachings.

===Diversity and pluralism===
In response to the British dominance and the British critique of Hinduism, various visions on Indian diversity and unity have been developed within the nationalistic and reform movements.{{sfn|King|2001}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}

The [[Brahmo Samaj]] strived towards monotheism, while no longer regarding the Vedas as sole religious authority.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} The Brahmo Samaj had a strong influence on the Neo-Vedanta of Vivekananda,{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} Aurobindo, Radhakrishnan and Gandhi,{{sfn|King|2001}} who strived toward a modernized, humanistic Hinduism with an open eye for societal problems and needs.{{sfn|King|2001}} Other groups, like the [[Arya Samaj]], strived toward a revival of Vedic authority.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=38}}{{refn|group=note|The [[Arya Samaj]] "teaches that the ''Vedic'' religion is the only true religion revealed by God for all."{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=39}} The Arya Samaj was founded by [[Dayanand Saraswati]] (1824-1883), who "was the solitary champion of Vedic authority and infallibility".{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=38}}}} In this context, various responses toward India's diversity developed.

====Hindu inclusivism – Hindutva and "Dharmic religions"====
In modern times, the orthodox measure of the primacy of the Vedas has been joined with the 'grand narrative' of the Vedic origins of Hinduism. The exclusion of Jainism and Buddhism excludes a substantial part of India's cultural and religious history from the asserttion of a strong and positive Hindu identity. Hindutva-ideology solves this problem by taking recourse to the notion of ''[[Hindutva]]'', "Hinduness", which includes Jainism and Buddhism. A recent strategy, exemplified by [[Rajiv Malhotra]], is the use of the term ''[[dharma]]'' as a common denominator, which also includes Jainism and Buddhism.{{sfn|Springer|2012}}

According to Larson, Malhotra's notion of "the so-called "Dharma” traditions"{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=314}} and their "integral unity" is another example of "neo-Hindu discourse".{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=314}} Malhotra, in his ''[[Being Different]]'', uses the term "Dharmic tradition" or "dharmic systems", "referring to all the Hindu, Buddhist, Jaina and Sikh traditions".{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}} He proposes that those traditions, despite their differences, share common features, the most important being "[[Dharma]]".{{refn|group=note|According to [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]], as described by Halbfass, the term "dharma" "assumed a fundamentally new meaning and function in modern Indian thought, beginning with [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay|Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]] in the nienteenth century. This process, in which ''dharma'' was presented as an equivalent of, but also a response to, the western notion of "religion", reflects a fundamental change in the Hindu sense of identity and in the attitude toward other religious and cultural traditions. The foreign tools of "religion" and "nation" became tolls of self-definition, and a new and precarious sense of the "unity of Hinduism" and of national as well as religious identity took root".{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=10}}}} They are also characterised by the notion of "Integral Unity", which means that "ultimately only the whole exists; the parts that make up the whole have but a relative existence. The whole is independent and indivisible",&lt;ref group=web name="Hitchhiker"&gt;[http://beingdifferentforum.blogspot.nl/2013/01/why-integral-unity-and-not-synthetic.html Hitchhiker's Guide to Rajiv Malhotra's Discussion Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to "Synthetic Unity", which "starts with parts that exist separately from one another".&lt;ref group=web name="Hitchhiker" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Malhotra, "the four Dharma systems also share these general presuppositions":{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=382-383}}
* "They all lead to the transcendent principle expressed variously as [[brahman]], [[nirvana]] and [[kevala]]";{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=382-383}}
* "They facilitate the attainment of an extraordinary and direct experience (such as the highest yogic [[samadhi]]), leading to the realization of the transcendent principle at the personal level (sometimes even at the embodied level as [[Jivanmukta|jivanamukta]] or avalokateçvara);{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=382-383}}
* "They facilitate a harmonious relation between the phenomenal and material mode of life ([[samsara]]) with the goal of spiritual liberation (paramartha) variously";{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=382-383}}
* "They all share praxis, including symbols, foods, customs, social values, sacred geography, family values, festivals and so on."{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=382-383}}}} Malhotra has received strong criticism of his ideas, for 'glossing over'{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338-339}} the differences between and even within the various traditions of India.{{sfn|Larson|2012}}{{sfn|Yelle|2012}}

In response, Malhotra explains that some of his critics confused "integral unity" with "homogeneity", thinking that Malhotra said all those traditions are essentially the same, when he actually wrote that Dharmic traditions share a sense of an "integral unity" despite differences.{{sfn|Malhotra|2013}}{{refn|group=note| According to Larson,
{{quote|Malhotra would have the reader believe that there is an "integral unity" underlying the various Dharma traditions, but, in fact, the very term "[[dharma]]" signals fascinating differences."{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}}}}

And according to Yelle,
{{quote|The idea of "dharmic traditions" represents a choice to gloss over, whether for ideological or strategic reasons, the vast differences that exist among and even within the various traditions of India ... These differences are invoked occasionally in order to buttress Malhotra’s argument for the pluralism of Indian culture, only to be erased as he presents as universal to dharmic traditions what is, in fact, easily recognizable as a thoroughly modern and homogenized ideal of Hinduism drawn from certain aspects of Vedanta philosophy and Yoga.{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338-339}}}}

In a response, Malhotra explains that some of his critics confused "integral unity" with "homogeneity", and that all those traditions are essentially the same, but that they share the assertion of an "integral unity":{{sfn|Malhotra|2013}}
{{quote|Yelle is right when he says that, "Every tradition is in fact an amalgam, and retains the traces of its composite origins." But he is wrong when he argues against my use of common features such as integral unity and embodied knowing, calling these "a thoroughly modern and homogenized ideal of Hinduism drawn from certain aspects of Vedånta philosophy and
Yoga." His concern about homogenization would have been legitimate if Being Different had proposed an integration of all Dharma traditions into a single new tradition. This is simply not my goal. Looking for commonality as a standpoint from which to gaze at a different family does not require us to relinquish the internal distinctiveness among the members of either family.{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=375-376}}}}}}

====Inclusivism and communalism====
According to Rinehart, neo-Vedanta is "a theological scheme for subsuming religious difference under the aegis of Vedantic truth".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}}{{refn|group=note|Though neo-Hindu authors prefer the idiom of tolerance to that of inclusivism, it is clear that what is advocated is less a secular view of toleration than a theological scheme for subsuming religious difference under the aegis of Vedantic truth. Thus Radhakrishnan's view of experience as the core of religious truth effectively leads to harmony only when and if other religions are willing to assume a position under the umbrella of Vedanta. We might even say that the theme of neo-Hindu tolerance provided the Hindu not simply with a means to claiming the right to stand alongside the other world religions, but with a strategy for promoting Hinduism as the ultimate form of religion itself.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}}}} According to Rinehart, the consequence of this line of reasoning is [[Communalism]],{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} the idea that "all people belonging to one religion have common economic, social and political interests and these interests are contrary to the interests of those belonging to another religion."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.pluralindia.com/book/Illustrated_prmier/Chapter_5.pdf Ram Puniyani, ''COMMUNALISM : Illustrated Primer, Chapter 5'']&lt;/ref&gt; Communalism has become a growing force in Indian politics, presenting several threats to India, hindring its [[nation-building]]{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=3}} and threatening "the secular, democratic character of the Indian state".{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=3}}

Rinehart notes that Hindu religiosity plays an important role in the nationalist movement,{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} and that "the neo-Hindu discource is the unintended consequence of the initial moves made by thinkers like Rammohan Roy and Vivekananda."{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} But Rinehart also points out that it is 
{{quote|...clear that there isn't a neat line of causation that leads from the philosophies of Rammohan Roy, Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan to the agenda of [...] militant Hindus.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=198}}{{refn|group=note|Neither is Radhakrishnan's "use" of religion in the defense of Asian culture and society against colonialism unique for his person, or India in general. The complexities of Asian nationalism are to be seen and understood in the context of colonialism, [[modernization]] and [[nation-building]].

===Influence on western spirituality===
{{Main article|Hinduism in the West|Nondualism}}

Neo-Vedanta has been influenced by western ideas{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}, but has also had a reverse influence on western spirituality.  Due to the colonisation of Asia by the western world, since the late 18th century an exchange of ideas has been taking place between the western world and Asia, which also influenced western religiosity.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} In 1785 appeared the first western translation of a Sanskrit-text.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=176}} It marked the growing interest in the Indian culture and languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177}} The first translation of Upanishads appeared in two parts in 1801 and 1802,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177}} which influenced [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who called them "the consolation of my life".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=178}}{{refn|group=note|And called his poodle "Atman".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=178}}}} Early translations also appeared in other European languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=183-184}}

A major force in the mutual influence of eastern and western ideas and religiosity was the [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=185-188}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} It searched for ancient wisdom in the east, spreading eastern religious ideas in the west.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012}} One of its salient features was the belief in [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Theosophy)|"Masters of Wisdom"]]{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Ascended Master Teachings]]}}, "beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others".{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}} The Theosophical Society also spread western ideas in the east, aiding a modernisation of eastern traditions, and contributing to a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{refn|group=note|The Theosophical Society had a major influence on [[Buddhist modernism]]{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and [[Hindu reform movements]],{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} and the spread of those modernised versions in the west.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} The [[Theosophical Society]] and the [[Arya Samaj]] were united from 1878 to 1882, as the [[Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj]].{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=107}} Along with [[Henry Steel Olcott|H.

==Appraisal and criticism==

===Appraisal===
According to Larson, the "solution of synthesis" prevailed in the work of Rammohun Roy, Sayyid Ahmed Khan, Rabindranath Tagore, [[Swami Vivekananda]], M.K. Gandhi, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Muhammad Iqbal, V.D. Savarkar, Jawaharlal Nehru, "and many others".{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=320}} Spear voices appraisal of this "solution of synthesis",{{refn|group=note|[S]uch willingness to achieve a synthesis that is neither fearful of the new nor dismissive of the old is 'the ideological secret of modern India'.}}{{refn|group=note|Spear 1958, page 187, in {{sfn|Larson|2012|p=320}}}} while G.R.

It alone can supply the philosophical framework for the understanding of the problems of our society.{{sfn|Sharma|2003|p=179}}}}

===Criticism===
Vivekenanda's presentation of Advaita Vedanta has been criticised for its misinterpretation of this tradition:
{{quote|Without calling into question the right of any philosopher to interpret Advaita according to his own understanding of it, [...] the process of Westernization has obscured the core of this school of thought. The basic correlation of renunciation and Bliss has been lost sight of in the attempts to underscore the cognitive structure and the realistic structure which according to Samkaracarya should both belong to, and indeed constitute the realm of māyā.{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}}}

According to [[Anantanand Rambachan]], Vivekananda emphasised ''[[Anubhava (Hindu thought)|anubhava]]'' ("personal experience"{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=1}}) over scriptural authority,{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=1}} but in his interpretation of Shankara, deviated from Shankara, who saw knowledge and understanding of the scriptures as the primary means to moksha.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} According to Comans, the emphasis on samadhi also is not to be found in the Upanishads nor with Shankara.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=307}} For Shankara, meditation and [[Nirvikalpa|Nirvikalpa Samadhi]] are means to gain knowledge of the already existing unity of Brahman and Atman.{{sfn|Comans|1993}}

In the 21st century, Neo-Vedanta has been criticized by Hindu traditionalists for the influence of "Radical Universalism", arguing that it leads to a "self-defeating philosophical relativism," and has weakened the status and strength of Hinduism.&lt;ref group=web name=moralies2013&gt;Frank Morales (February 15, 2013).

==Criticism of neo-Hinduism label==

===Criticism of Paul Hacker===
In the 20th century the German Indologist [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]] used the terms "Neo-Vedanta" and "Neo-Hinduism" polemically, to criticize modern Hindu thinkers,.{{sfn|Halbfass|2007b}} Halbfass regards the terms "Neo-Vedanta" and "Neo-Hinduism" as "useful and legitimate as convenient labels",{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} but has criticized Hacker for use that was "simplistic".{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} Furthermore, he asks,
{{quote|What is the significance and legitimacy of the "Neo" in expressions like "Neo-Hinduism and "Neo-Vedanta"? Could we speak of "Neo-Christianity" as well? In fact, I have used this term [...] and not all my Christian readers and reviewers were happy about the term.{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}}}}

Halbfass wrote that the adoption of the terms 
{{quote|"Neo-Hinduism" and "Neo-Vedanta" [...] by Western scholars reflects Christian and European claims and perspectives which continue to be an irritant to Indians today. For Hacker, the "Neo" in "Neo-Hinduism" implies a lack of authenticity, an apologetic accommodation to Western ideas, and a hybridization of the tradition.{{sfn|Halbfass|2007b|p=587–588}}{{refn|group=note|Halbfass adds that "I have tried [...] to argue that Hacker's radical critique reflects above all a typically Christian and European obsession with the concept of the individual person."{{sfn|Halbfass|2007b|p=588}}}}}}

Bagchee and Adluri argue that German Indology, including Hacker, was merely "a barely disguised form of religious evangelism".{{sfn|Bagche|Adluri|2013|p=215–229}}

According to Malhotra, an Indian-American Hindu writer, it was Paul Hacker who popularized the term 'neo-Hinduism' in the 1950s, "to refer to the modernization of Hinduism brought about by many Indian thinkers, the most prominent being Swami Vivekananda."&lt;ref group=web name="HT" /&gt; In Malhotra's view, "Hacker charged that 'neo-Hindus', most notably Vivekananda, have disingenuously adopted Western ideas and expressed them using Sanskrit."&lt;ref group=web name="HT" /&gt; Malhotra also notes that Hacker was a biased Christian apologist: 
{{quote|What is less known about Hacker is that he was also an unabashed Christian apologist who freely used his academic standing to further the cause of his Christian agenda. He led a parallel life, passionately advocating Christianity while presenting the academic face of being neutral and objective.&lt;ref group=web name="HT"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hinduism Today Staff|title=Book Review: Defending Hinduism’s Philosophical Unity|journal=Hinduism Today|date=October 2015|issue=October 2015|pages=66–69|url=http://rajivmalhotra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hinduism-today_indras-net-review.pdf|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}According to David Smith, Hacker's belief was that the ethical values of 'neo-Hinduism" came from Western philosophy and Christianity, just in Hindu terms. Hacker also believed that Hinduism began in the 1870's. He saw Bankin Chattopadhyaya, Aruobindo, Gandhi, and Radhakishnan as its most famous proponents.&lt;ref name="'Reformed' Hinduism"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=David |title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations |date=February 3, 2016 |publisher=Linda Woodhead |isbn=9780415858816 |page=57 |edition=third}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neglect of inherent development of religions===
Brian K. Smith notes that "The Neo-Hindu indigenous authorities are often dismissed as 'inauthentic,' their claims to legitimacy compromised by their encounters with modernity", which influenced their worldview and religious positions,{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=324}} but points out that 
{{quote|''All'' religions, at various points in recent history and under varying circumstances, have adopted to the modern world and the accompanying intellectual trends of modernity. 'Hinduism' (or 'Neo-Hinduism') is not unique in this regard either; the Neo-Hindu movement shares many commonalties with developments in other religious traditions around the world over the past several hundred years. The study of religion is the study of traditions in constant change.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=325}}{{refn|group=note|Smith expressed concern that "scholars of religion do not exercise their authority to write about religion(s) in a vacuum [...] One of the principal ramifications of the trend in Indology to deny the existence of a unified religion called 'Hinduism' is to delegitimize those in India who, in varying ways, have represented themselves as 'Hindus' and their religion as 'Hinduism.' [...] This kind of indifference to indigenous conceptualizations of self-identity [...] is especially problematic in an age where Western scholars often claim to be concerned to allow the 'natives to speak' and 'assume agency' over representational discourse [...] Denying the legitimacy of any and all 'Hindu' representations of Hinduism can easily crossover into a [[Orientalism|Neo-Orientalism]], whereby indigenous discourse is once again silenced or ignored as the product of a false consciousness delivered to it by outside forces or as simply irrelevant to the authoritative deliberations of Western [[Indology|Indologists]].{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=332–333}}}}}}

According to Madaio, the notion that Vivekananda and other Hindu modernists deviate from orthodox, classical Advaita Vedanta, neglects the fact that considerable developments took place in Indian religious thinking, including Advaita Vedanta.{{sfn|Madaio|2017|p=2}}

===The "myth of Neo-Hinduism"===
[[Rajiv Malhotra]], in his book [[Indra's Net (book)|Indra's Net]], has stated that there is a "myth of Neo-Hinduism".{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=26}} According to him, there are "eight myths"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=28}} of Neo-Hinduism such as "colonial Indology's biases were turned into Hinduism" (Myth 2){{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=31}} and "Hinduism was manufactured and did not grow organically" (Myth 3).{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=32}} Malhotra denies that "Vivekananda manufactured Hinduism", or that `neo-Vedanta' suppressed "the traditions of the Indian masses." According to Malhotra, there is "an integrated, unified spiritual substratum in ancient India,"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014}} and argues that
{{quote|the branding of contemporary Hinduism as a faux 'neo-Hinduism' is a gross mischaracterization of both traditional and contemporary Hinduism [...] [C]ontemporary Hinduism is a continuation of a dynamic tradition. It is not in any way less authentic or less 'Hindu' than what may be dubbed traditional Hinduism. There are negative connotations to the term 'neo' which imply something artificial, untrue, or unfaithful to the original. Other world religions have undergone similar adaptations in modern times, though there are no such references to 'neo-Christianity' [...] I resist the wide currency being gained for the term 'neo-Hinduism', because this fictional divide between 'neo' and 'original' Hinduism subverts Hinduism.{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=30}}}}

According to Malhotra, the 'myth of neo-Hinduism' "is used to fragment Hindu society by pitting its spiritual giants against one another and distorting their subtle and deeply intricate viewpoints."{{sfn|Malhotra|2014}} Also according to him, "the definition of neo-Hinduism has been contrived and [...] gained authenticity, in part because it suits certain academic and political agendas, and in part because it has been reiterated extensively without adequate critical response."{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=42}}

Non-difference, this word not to be found in the [[English language|English]] Dictionary is the nearest English translation of the [[Sanskrit]] word, Abheda. The word, Abheda, means non-existence of difference. In [[Vedanta philosophy]] this word plays a vital role in explaining the indicatory mark in respect of the unity of the individual self with the Infinite or [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Brahma sutra]] III.ii.26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine of Non-difference==

Audolomi ([[Brahma Sutra]] I.iv.21) is believed to have held the view that the individual self differs from the supreme self while it possesses a body, but when a man obtains the clear knowledge by means of practice and meditation, dies, leaves the body and obtains complete liberation, the individual self becomes the supreme self, which means in liberation, there is no difference; in transmigration, there is difference; the absolutely different individual self becomes identical in the state of liberation. This is the non-identity non-difference theory of Audolomi. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Early Vedanta Philosophy|author=Hajime Nakamura|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=383|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=asNLliQHDNQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kasakrtsna ([[Brahma Sutra]] I.iv.22) believed that the very supreme self exists as the individual soul without undergoing any change which view-point is supported by [[Badarayana]] when he reiterates that the individual is only an apparent part of the partless Brahman; the difference is imaginary. This is the non-duality non-difference theory of Kasakrtsna. In his commentary on the [[Brahma Sutra]] II.i.14 [[Adi Sankara]] explains that the difference between the 'experiencer' and the 'things experienced' which is observed in common experience, in reality does not exist, there is non-difference of cause and effect for all things are merely modifications, and "a modification has speech as its origin and exists only in name" ([[Chandogya Upanishad]] VI.i.4), and "All this has That as its essence; That is the Reality; That is the Self; That thou art" (Chandogya Upanishad Vi.vii.7); "All this is but the Self" (Chandogya Upanishad VII.xxv.2). Difference commonly observed is the creation of ignorance whereas non-difference is natural; when the individual ignorance is destroyed through knowledge unity with Self is attained – "Anyone who knows that supreme Brahman becomes Brahman indeed" ([[Mundaka Upanishad]] III.ii.9), "Being but Brahman, he is absorbed in Brahman" ([[Brhadaranyaka Upanishad]] IV.iv.6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya|author=Adi Shankara|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|place=Kolkata|pages=286,334,630|url= https://www.amazon.com/BRAHMA-SUTRAS-Advaita-Vedanta-Classic/lm/R2EBQFGQV9HGFJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hindu philosophy]] according to the Doctrine of '''Non-difference''' (''abheda'') there is no difference (''bheda'') whatsoever between the individual self ([[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]) and the supreme Self ([[Paramatman]]) or ([[Brahman]]). The opinion of the [[Sruti]] is that the knowledge of oneness of Brahman and atman is ''samyag-jnana'' ( [[Vivekachudamani]]. 204). The word ''ekatvam'' in this sloka that reads - ''brahmatmaikatvavijnanam samyajjnanam sruter matam'' means "non-difference", the experience of this non-difference between Brahman (supreme Self) and atman (individual self) is ''samyag-jnana''.  It is the person tainted by ''bhrama'' ("delusion") and ''[[Pramada (Indian philosophy)|pramada]]'' ("carelessness") who cannot determine what is ''samyag-jnana'' or "true knowledge". Right knowledge removes all products of ''ajnana'' ("ignorance"); ''ajnana''  is of the nature of ''Mithya'', hinting differences between atman and Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=225|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ncQYAAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, all phenomenal expressions imagined on Brahman are denied and Brahman stands out as outside the negation [[Neti neti]].

==Nature of Non-difference==
According to the Theory of the Pre-existent Effect, there is no annihilation of the existence, nor is there any creation of the non-existent, which means, there cannot be anything new or the destruction of what exists; and that there is no relation between cause and effect. With regard to the non-difference of the cause and the effect the general views are that, a) the difference (negation of non-difference) of the cause and effect is the essence (''swarupa'') of the cause and the effect, and the non-difference of them is their relation of identity; b) that difference of cause and effect is their essential quality and that their non-difference is the negation of that difference, and c) that both difference and non-difference are essential qualities of the cause and effect and are equally positive in character and colour. These views lead to the reasoning that non-difference of the cause and effect cannot be taken as absolutely different from them, non-difference is not an attribute different from cause and effect and if difference is interpreted as constituting the essential nature of the cause and effect, with non-difference qualifying it as an attribute then a rational conception of the relation between cause and effect cannot be formed. It is held that the effect before its manifestation remains undifferentiated in the cause, because the causal substance is the substance of the effect as a substance therefore, the effect cannot be different from the cause, it evolves out of the cause, it exists inseparable from the cause and at the time of destruction it merges in the nature of the cause. Also, specific features that constitute the effect are not different from the cause. Thus, the entire world which prior to its manifestation is existent in an unmanifest state in the nature of [[Prakrti]], the Primal Energy, the modification of [[Prakrti]] resulting in the perceivable world does not make it lose its identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Philosophy of Indian Religion|author=Sadhu Santinath|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=204|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rzQeI6UoM7YC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=Non-difference&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ueLkUN6VF4SnrAeHroDYDA&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Non-difference&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Existence is a manifestation of the unmanifest Brahman, and the individual souls (atman) are the reflections of Brahman and non-different from Brahman, but even then non-difference cannot become the content of awareness without reference to difference. To the Advaitins, non-difference is real and it is not known through reasoning. Brahman is then held to be knowable because it is different from empirical things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Samkhya : A Dualist Tradition in Indian Philosophy Vol.4|author=Gerald James Larson|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|page=401|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ak1Qla4xUgMC&amp;pg=PA401&amp;dq=Non-difference&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yvDkUJbVMcXOrQeWtoGIDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Non-difference&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==
Non-difference is the essential (''svabhavika'') condition  - ''He who knows the highest [[Brahman]] becomes Brahman Himself'' &lt;ref&gt;[[Mundaka Upanishad]] III.ii.9&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Being Brahman he goes to Brahman'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] IV.iv.9&lt;/ref&gt; while the distinction of souls from Brahman and each other is due to their limiting adjuncts (internal organs, sense-organs and the body), and the ''Upadhis'' that are produced, in accordance with the actions of the individual souls, as essentially non-different and different from Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedanta Sutras|author=Ramanuja|publisher=Echo Library|page=127|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nc0OcXbTqUsC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=Non-difference&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Jg7lULLoGsbyrQe71IGgDQ&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Non-difference&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Advaitins maintain the view that there is complete undividedness (''akhandata'') or identity (''tadatmya'') of the individual soul and Brahman; the former is the latter limited by artificial conditions (''upadhis''). According to [[Vijnanabhikshu]], difference (''bheda'') and non-difference (''abheda'') can also be understood to mean separation (''vibhaga'') and non-separation (''avibhaga'').e.g. pure water poured into pure water. The statements that reject difference have as their concern ''difference'' in the sense of non-separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History]]|author=Andrew J. Nicholson|publisher=Columbia University Press|page=43|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As regards the difference in the sense of non-separation [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] explains that the essence of that which is gross, mortal, limited and defined is the eye for it is the essence of the defined which means, the mental mode associated with comparison that gives rise to duality and multiplicity i.e. separateness, is connected with the eye. The essence of that which is subtle, immortal, unlimited, unchanging and undefined is the unseeable being that is in the right-eye. Similarly the defined is the Sun but the undefined is that which moves within the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|place=New Delhi|page=181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXZJXwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
With regard the meaning of [[Brahma Sutra]] II.i.15 which reads ''bhave cha uplabhdheha'', [[Adi Shankara]] explains that it means - the effect is non-different from the cause for this further reason, that the effect is perceived when the cause is there, but not otherwise, it also means that not only is the non-difference of the cause and effect to be accepted on the authority of scriptures, their non-difference is also to be accepted on the strength of the existence of such a perception; for direct perception does occur about the non-difference of the cause and effect. And, with regard the interpretation of [[Brahma Sutra]] III.ii.22, [[Adi Shankara]] explains that neither the form of Brahman consisting of the phenomenal manifestations can be denied, nor Brahman, the possessor of form, for that would lead to [[nihilism]]. And that the unreal can only be denied on the basis of something real. Since the [[Sruti]] insists that [[Brahman]] is to be realized as existing &lt;ref&gt;[[Katha Upanishad]] II.iii.13&lt;/ref&gt; failing to reach which, words turn back with the mind (&lt;ref&gt;[[Taittiriya Upanishad]] II.ix.1&lt;/ref&gt; it is the phenomenal expression alone of Brahman is denied and not Brahman which appears to be different during activity, yet intrinsically there is non-difference, mark the Mahavakya, [[Tat tvam asi]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Chandogya Upanishad]] VI.viii-xvi&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sruti vakya, ''There is no other witness but Him''. The individual self, which is non-different from the supreme Self i.e. Brahman, does not become liberated so long as it persists to be by nature an agent and experience when at the same time that its identity with Brahman, realizable through knowledge, does not exist “because when there is duality, as it were, then one sees something” “but when to the knower of Brahman everything has become the Self, then what should one see and through what?”&lt;ref&gt;[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] II.iv.14, IV.v.15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya|author=Adi Shankara|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|place=Kolkata|pages=336,623–632,890|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15494460-brahma-sutra-bhasya-of-sankaracarya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On Truth''''' is a 2006 book by [[Harry Frankfurt]]. It is a follow-up to his 1986 essay, ''[[On Bullshit]]''.&lt;ref name="The New York Times - Sunday Book Review - Bull Session - 12 November 2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/books/review/McCulloch.t.html|title=Sunday Book Review - Bull Session|last=McCulloch|first=Alison|date=November 12, 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''On Truth'', Frankfurt develops the argument that individuals should care about the [[truth]], regardless of whether they intend to be truthful. Frankfurt explicitly avoids a definition of "truth" beyond the idea of the commonsense concept of truth people commonly hold, i.e., that which [[Correspondence theory of truth|corresponds]] to [[reality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCulloch|first1=Alison|title=On Truth By Harry G. Frankfurt - Books - Review|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/books/review/McCulloch.t.html|work=The New York Times|date=12 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Frankfurt's strategy is to show that the truth, whether an individual is to be truthful or not, is integral to nearly every endeavor, the final point of his argument being that it is a requirement for self-knowledge and therefore all distinctions between ourselves and the world. Frankfurt concludes that the importance of truth, and thus the need to care about it, is incorrigible thereby.

'''Para Tattva''' ([[Sanskrit]]: '''पर तत्त्व'''&lt;!-- ref:  http://spokensanskrit.de/ --&gt;) is a [[Sanskrit]] phrase meaning “Supreme Truth,” as studied, realized, worshipped and revealed by the saints of India's [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic tradition]].  The root ''tat'' is equivalent to the English word “that,” while the suffix ''-tva'' is used like our suffix “-ness,” giving a sense of “that-ness,” commonly understood as truth or principle.  ''Para'' is simply “supreme,” “transcendental” or “absolute,” in this context describing the principles of truth in a wholesome context.

Two very common conceptions in this day and age amongst students of the [[Vedas]] (which includes the core scriptures Rg, Sama, Yajur and Atharva, and may also extend into the vast body of associated peripheral works) are the [[Hindu]] tattvas of [[Brahman]] and [[Paramatman]], which may be understood respectively as the witness-consciousness (Self as knower) and the Supersoul (supercontrolling Godhead).  The mainstream Hindu social class in traditional Vedic culture is the functionary priesthood, and includes teachers and scribes as well as medical practitioners.  Those Brahmanas who tend to be theonomous in nature but who relate to Deity more as the absolute Self in its wise or gnostic capacity may be called Brahma-vadis, meaning practitioners of Brahma-vada, the endorsement of Brahma-tattva.

Brahmanas and [[Yogi]]s (deeply meditative saints) who are more progressively theolatrous, whether exoterically or esoterically, may be called Paramatma-vadis.  Their relationship with the Deity advances beyond theoretical knowledge of Self into the dynamics of what may be called absolute civilization.  Their practice of cosmic consciousness comprehends ontological relationships between the Witness which is the relatively inferior Self and the supercontrolling Godhead, attunement with Whom is the prime requirement for entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven.

The [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] school of Vedic theology emphasizes a third significant phase of Para Tattva beyond Brahman and Paramatma.  Positioning themselves (the Vaishnavas) as authoritatively superior both socially and spiritually to a non-Vaishnavite Brahmin class, they claim that the real goal of a theistic saint is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, known as [[Bhagavan]].  Where Brahma-tattva tends to be perception oriented and Paramatma-tattva concerned with absolute functionality, the tattva of Bhagavan expands into explorations of quality, including and especially the superlative quality of glory which is the feature that reveals the Kingdom of Heaven, known to the Vaishnavas as [[Vaikunta|Vaikuntha]].

Once Bhagavan is recognized, reality may be comprehended sixfold, according to six essential qualities of divine personality.  Where [[Vishnu]] is the [[God the Father|Supreme Father]], Lord of Vaikuntha, He actually has a qualitatively superlative aspect, where He is known as Lord [[Rama]], the Supreme Personality of Godhead as personification of the highest quality of glory, Whose mood is actually more intimate and friendly.  On the other hand, where Vishnu's absolute fatherhood leans more toward the relatively impersonal functionality of Paramatma, He becomes represented as [[Shiva]], Who may be compared to the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]].  This phase is recognized by the Vaishnavas in terms of the quality of strength.

Backing down the qualitative ladder from Bhagavan Lord Rama's superlative glory, through the strength represented by Paramatma Shiva, our study returns to the quality of wisdom or knowledge personified by Brahma, who is the first created [[Son of God|Son of Father Vishnu]], and may therefore be compared to the [[Christ]].  Understanding this much, then, gives us half the picture of Para Tattva, and is the framework of what may be called the right-handed path.  Lord Rama (the original Vishnu) as Bhagavan is all-glorious, Shiva as Paramatma is all-powerful, and Brahma who is Brahma-tattva is all wise.  Three qualities, however, remain to be examined.

The Vedic tradition initially portrays reality as fourfold, and this qualitative framework may gradually be comprehended in a broader context once the left-handed path is added to the relatively simplistic design which begins beneath Brahma's position and extends upwardly beyond Lord Rama's kingdom.  The fourth aspect of Deity Whom we find beyond the glorious Rama is described by the Veda as the all-beautiful [[Krishna]], Whose alluring pastimes are lovingly worshipped by many devotees all over the world.  At the other extreme end of fourfold reality is a fifth entity known as [[Sudarshana Chakra|Sudarshana]], the original Chakra who is Lord Vishnu's weapon of absolute destruction and therefore represents the fifth quality of Bhagavan which is detachment.

Thus far we have covered five of six qualities of Bhagavan, which outline the traditional fourfold path:  beauty (Krishna), glory (Rama), strength (Shiva), knowledge (Brahma) and detachment (Sudarshana).  Now one last principle can be observed as connecting the two ends of our envisioned framework of reality, this being the quality of possession, which is personified by a lesser-known aspect of Bhagavan whose name is [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]].  Chaitanya is connected negatively through possessiveness to Sudarshana's detachment through his exhibition of renunciation, and positively through possessiveness to Krishna's beauty through loving devotion.  In this way, Bhagavan realization advances our initial studies of Para Tattva into a full-circle comprehension of quality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6522">In [[mathematics]], a '''partition of unity''' of a [[topological space]] ''X'' is a set ''R'' of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]]s from ''X'' to the [[unit interval]] [0,1] such that for every point, &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;,
* there is a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of ''x'' where all but a [[finite set|finite]] number of the functions of ''R'' are 0, and
* the sum of all the function values at ''x'' is 1, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\;\sum_{\rho\in R} \rho(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Partition of unity illustration.svg|center|thumb|500px|A partition of unity of a circle with four functions. The circle is unrolled to a line segment (the bottom solid line) for graphing purposes. The dashed line on top is the sum of the functions in the partition.]]
Partitions of unity are useful because they often allow one to extend local constructions to the whole space.  They are also important in the [[interpolation]] of data, in [[signal processing]], and the theory of [[spline function]]s.

== Existence ==
The existence of partitions of unity assumes two distinct forms:

# Given any [[open cover]] {''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; of a space, there exists a partition {ρ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; indexed ''over the same set I'' such that [[Support (mathematics)|supp]] ρ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;⊆''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Such a partition is said to be '''subordinate to the open cover''' {''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.
# If the space is locally-compact, given any open cover {''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; of a space, there exists a partition {ρ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''j''∈''J''&lt;/sub&gt; indexed over a possibly distinct index set ''J'' such that each ρ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; has [[compact support]] and for each ''j''∈''J'', supp ρ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;⊆''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for some ''i''∈''I''.

Thus one chooses either to have the [[support (mathematics)|supports]] indexed by the open cover, or compact supports.  If the space is [[compact space|compact]], then there exist partitions satisfying both requirements.

A finite open cover always has a continuous partition of unity subordinated to it, provided the space is locally compact and Hausdorff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudin|first=Walter|title=Real and complex analysis|year=1987|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0-07-054234-1|pages=40|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Paracompact space|Paracompactness]] of the space is a necessary condition to guarantee the existence of a partition of unity [[paracompact space|subordinate to any open cover]].  Depending on the [[category (mathematics)|category]] to which the space belongs, it may also be a sufficient condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charalambos D.|last=Aliprantis|first2=Kim C.|last2=Border
|title=Infinite dimensional analysis: a hitchhiker's guide
|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-32696-0|pages=716|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The construction uses [[mollifier]]s (bump functions), which exist in continuous and [[smooth manifolds]], but not in [[analytic manifold]]s. Thus for an open cover of an analytic manifold, an analytic partition of unity subordinate to that open cover generally does not exist. ''See'' [[analytic continuation]].

If ''R'' and ''S'' are partitions of unity for spaces ''X'' and ''Y'', respectively, then the set of all pairwise products &lt;math&gt;\{\; \rho\sigma \;:\; \rho\in R \wedge \sigma \in S\;\}&lt;/math&gt; is a partition of unity for the [[cartesian product]] space ''X''×''Y''.

== Example ==
We can construct a partition of unity on &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; by looking at a chart on the complement of a point &lt;math&gt;p \in S^1&lt;/math&gt; sending &lt;math&gt;S^1 -\{p\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with center &lt;math&gt;q \in S^1&lt;/math&gt;. Now, let &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; be a [[bump function]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; defined by&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = \begin{cases}
\exp\left(\frac{1}{x^2-1}\right) &amp; x \in (-1,1) \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;then, both this function and &lt;math&gt;1 - \Phi&lt;/math&gt; can be extended uniquely onto &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; by setting &lt;math&gt;\Phi(p) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the set &lt;math&gt;\{ (S^1 - \{p\}, \Phi), (S^1 - \{q\}, 1-\Phi) \}&lt;/math&gt;forms a partition of unity over &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Variant definitions==
Sometimes a less restrictive definition is used: the sum of all the function values at a particular point is only required to be positive, rather than 1, for each point in the space.  However, given such a set of functions, one can obtain a partition of unity in the strict sense by dividing every function by the sum of all functions (which is defined, since at any point it has only a finite number of terms).

==Applications==
A partition of unity can be used to define the integral (with respect to a [[volume form]]) of a function defined over a manifold: One first defines the integral of a function whose support is contained in a single coordinate patch of the manifold; then one uses a partition of unity to define the integral of an arbitrary function; finally one shows that the definition is independent of the chosen partition of unity.

A partition of unity can be used to show the existence of a [[Riemannian metric]] on an arbitrary manifold.

[[Method of steepest descent#The case of multiple non-degenerate saddle points|Method of steepest descent]] employs a partition of unity to construct asymptotics of integrals.

[[Linkwitz–Riley filter]] is an example of practical implementation of partition of unity to separate input signal into two output signals containing only high- or low-frequency components.

The [[Bernstein polynomial]]s of a fixed degree ''m'' are a family of ''m''+1 linearly independent polynomials that are a partition of unity for the unit interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.

The method is model-independent because it does not depend on any specific compartmental model configuration for the tracer, and the minimal assumption is that the behavior of the tracer can be approximated by two compartments &amp;ndash; a "central" (or reversible) compartment that is in rapid equilibrium with [[blood plasma|plasma]], and a "peripheral" (or irreversible) compartment, where tracer enters without ever leaving during the time of the measurements.&lt;ref name="Patlak1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Patlak1985" /&gt;  The amount of tracer in the [[region of interest]] is accumulating according to the equation:

: &lt;math&gt;R(t) = K \int_0^t C_p(\tau) \, d\tau + V_0  C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; represents time after tracer injection, &lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of tracer in [[region of interest]], &lt;math&gt;C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of tracer in plasma or blood, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Clearance (medicine)|clearance]] determining the rate of entry into the peripheral (irreversible) compartment, and &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[distribution volume]] of the tracer in the central compartment. The first [[Term (mathematics)|term]] of the right-hand side represents tracer in the peripheral compartment, and the second term tracer in the central compartment.

By [[division (mathematics)|dividing]] both sides by &lt;math&gt;C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains:

: &lt;math&gt;{R(t) \over C_p(t)} = K {\int_0^t C_p(\tau) \, d\tau \over C_p(t)} + V_0&lt;/math&gt;

The unknown constants &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained by [[linear regression]] from a [[Graph of a function|graph]] of &lt;math&gt;{R(t) \over C_p(t)}&lt;/math&gt; against &lt;math&gt; \int_0^t C_p(\tau) \, d\tau / C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Personal Identifiers''' ('''PID''') are a subset of [[personally identifiable information]] (PII) [[data element]]s, which identify a unique individual and can permit another person to “assume” that individual’s identity without their knowledge or consent. 
	
This can occur when PID data elements are used in any of these ways:
#Alone
#Combined with a person’s name

'''Phubbing''' is a term coined as part of a campaign by ''Macquarie Dictionary'' to describe the habit of snubbing someone in favour of a [[mobile phone]]. In May 2012, the advertising agency behind the campaign, McCann, had invited a number of lexicographers, authors, and poets to coin a [[neologism]] to describe the behaviour. The word "phubbing" was first described by McCann Group Account Director Adrian Mills, who was working with [[David Astle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4FLTM82VcI |title= The first use of the word phubbing |publisher= YouTube |date= 2017-01-03 |accessdate= 2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has appeared in media around the world and was popularized by the Stop Phubbing campaign created by McCann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://stopphubbing.com/ |title=Stop Phubbing |publisher= Stop Phubbing |date= |accessdate= 2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stop Phubbing campaign==
The Stop Phubbing campaign site, and related [[Facebook]] page, was part of an elaborate public relations effort designed to promote the ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pathak |first= Shareen |url= http://adage.com/article/news/mccann-melbourne-made-a-word-sell-a-dictionary/244595/ |title= McCann Melbourne Made Up a Word to Sell a Dictionary &amp;#124; News - Advertising Age |publisher= Adage.com |date= 2013-10-07 |accessdate= 2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the media, the website was originally credited by an Australian college student named Alex Haigh, who had been interning at McCann and was subsequently hired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tom Chatfield |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/the-rise-of-phubbing--aka-phone-snubbing-8747229.html |title= The rise of phubbing - aka phone snubbing - Features - Gadgets &amp; Tech |publisher= The Independent |date= 2013-08-05 |accessdate= 2013-10-12 |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film, titled ''A Word is Born'', describes the entire process and serves as an advertisement for the dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSOfuUYCV_0 |title= Phubbing: A Word is Born |publisher= YouTube |date= 2013-10-08 |accessdate= 2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phubbing in the media==
The campaign was picked up by numerous media outlets, notably those in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Mexico]], and [[Germany]]. The press reported on surveys showing statistics of the number of the people "phubbing", and published [[etiquette]] guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/10304653/The-15-most-annoying-things-about-iPhones.html |title=The 15 most annoying things about iPhones |publisher=Telegraph |date=2013-09-13 |accessdate=2013-10-12 |location=London |first=Michael |last=Hogan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinmetz |first=Katy |url=http://techland.time.com/2013/08/06/why-the-stop-phubbing-campaign-is-going-viral/#ixzz2d3mMXCFM |title=Why the ‘Stop Phubbing’ Campaign Is Going Viral &amp;#124; TIME.com |publisher=Techland.time.com |date=2013-08-06 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts, professor of marketing at [[Baylor University]] Hankamer School of Business, that was published in the journal "Computers In Human Behavior". The study consisted of two separate surveys of more than 450 U.S. adults to learn the relational effects of "phubbing" or partner phubbing. The survey found that 46.3 percent of respondents said their partners phubbed them, and 22.6 percent said it caused issues in their relationship.&lt;ref name="Today"/&gt; In an interview with [[Yahoo!]] Health, Roberts said, "We found that the ones that reported higher partner phubbing fought more with their partner and were less satisfied with their relationship than those who reported less phubbing."&lt;ref name="Digital"/&gt;

'''Pity''' is a sympathetic sorrow evoked by the suffering of others and is used in a comparable sense to  ''[[compassion]]'', ''[[condolence]]'' or ''[[empathy]]''.  Through frequent, insincere, pejorative usage, it is used to connote feelings of superiority, condescension, or contempt.&lt;ref name="Stuff Pitty!"&gt;[http://www.newint.org/features/2005/11/01/keynote/ Stuff Pity!]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Den Leichnam des Darius.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander sees with a look of pity that Darius has died from his wounds.]]
[[File:Songs of Innocence and of Experience, copy L, 1795 (Yale Center for British Art) The Human Abstract.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Human Abstract (poem)|The Human Abstract]]'', a poem in William Blake's collection ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', in which he proclaims "Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody Poor" (1-2). This version is copy L created in 1795 and currently held by the [[Yale Center for British Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=songsie.l.illbk.47&amp;java=no| title = Songs of Innocence and of Experience, copy L, object 47 (Bentley 47, Erdman 47, Keynes 47) "The Human Abstract" | editors = Morris Eaves, Robert N.

The word ''pity'' comes from the Latin ''[[Pietas|pietās]]'', that is also etymon of ''[[piety]]''.

The word is often used in the translations from ancient Greek into English of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Poetics'' and ''Rhetoric''.  [[Aristotle]] argued (Rhetoric 2.8) that before a person can feel pity for another human, the person must first have experienced suffering of a similar type, and the person must also be somewhat distanced or removed from the sufferer.&lt;ref name="konstan"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Konstan|title=Pity Transformed|location=London|publisher=Duckworth|year=2001|pages=181|ISBN=0-7156-2904-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' he defines pity as follows: "Let pity, then, be a kind of pain in the case of an apparent destructive or painful harm of one not deserving to encounter it, which one might expect oneself, or one of one's own, to suffer, and this when it seems near".&lt;ref name="konstan" /&gt; Aristotle also pointed out that "people pity their acquaintances, provided that they are not exceedingly close in kinship; for concerning these they are disposed as they are concerning themselves...For what is terrible is different from what is pitiable, and is expulsive of pity".&lt;ref name="konstan" /&gt; Thus, from Aristotle's perspective, in order to feel pity, a person must believe that the person who is suffering does not deserve their fate.&lt;ref name="konstan" /&gt; Developing a traditional Greek view in his work on poetry, Aristotle also defines tragedy as a kind of imitative poetry that provokes pity and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', section 6.1449b24-28.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The religious concept of pity was reinforced in the West after the acceptance of Judeo-Christian concepts of God by the proposition of a deity which felt pity for all humanity. Consistent references to the concept of God's pity can be found in the older Jewish tradition. The Hebrew word "Hesed" translated in the LXX by "Eleos" carries the meaning roughly equivalent to pity in the sense of compassion, mercy and loving-kindness. (See The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament, 698a.) By the nineteenth century, two different kinds of pity had come to be distinguished, which we might call "benevolent pity" and "contemptuous pity" (see Kimball). David Hume observed that pity which has in it a strong mixture of good-will, is nearly allied to contempt, which is a species of dislike, with a mixture of pride. Pity is an [[emotion]] that almost always results from an encounter with a real or perceived unfortunate, injured, or pathetic creature.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Jean-Jacques Rousseau had the following opinion of pity as opposed to love for others: "It is therefore certain that pity is a natural sentiment, which, by moderating in every individual the activity of self-love, contributes to the mutual preservation of the whole species. It is this pity which hurries us without reflection to the assistance of those we see in distress; it is this pity which, in a state of nature, stands for laws, for manners, for virtue, with this advantage, that no one is tempted to disobey her sweet and gentle voice: it is this pity which will always hinder a robust savage from plundering a feeble child, or infirm old man, of the subsistence they have acquired with pain and difficulty, if he has but the least prospect of providing for himself by any other means: it is this pity which, instead of that sublime maxim of argumentative justice, Do to others as you would have others do to you, inspires all men with that other maxim of natural goodness a great deal less perfect, but perhaps more useful, Consult your own happiness with as little prejudice as you can to that of others. It is in a word, in this natural sentiment, rather than in fine-spun arguments, that we must look for the cause of that reluctance which every man would experience to do evil, even independently of the maxims of education." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rousseau|first1=Jean-Jacques|title=Discourse on the origin of inequality|date=2004|publisher=Dover|location=Mineola|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person experiencing pity will experience a combination of intense [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]] and [[mercy]] for the person or creature, often giving the pitied some kind of [[aid]], physical help, and/or [[money|financial assistance]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Nietzsche, however, pointed out that since all people to some degree value [[self-esteem]] and [[self-worth]], pity can negatively affect any situation. Additionally, pity may actually be [[psychologically]] harmful to the pitied: [[Self-pity]] and [[Clinical depression|depression]] can sometimes be the result of the power imbalance fostered by pity, sometimes with extremely negative psychological and psycho-social consequences for the pitied party.

Though in his later works he reverses his position and sees Pity as an emotion that can draw beings together, [[mysticism|Mystic]] poet [[William Blake]] is known to have been ambivalent about the emotion Pity. In [[The Book of Urizen]] Pity begins when Los looks on the body of Urizen bound in chains (Urizen 13.50–51). However, Pity furthers the fall, "For pity divides the soul" (13.53), dividing Los and Enitharmon (Enitharmon is named Pity at her birth). Analyzers of this work assert that Blake shows that "Pity defuses the power of righteous indignation and proper prophetic wrath that lead to action. Pity is a distraction; the soul is divided between it and the action a 'pitiable' state demands. This is seen as Los's division into active male and tearful female, the latter deluding the former."{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Again railing against Pity in ''[[The Human Abstract (poem)|The Human Abstract]]'', Blake exclaims: "Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody Poor" (1–2).

== Neurological perspectives ==
Modern neurology asserts that pity consists of an initial aversion to the plight of the sufferer, after which the higher parts of the brain make a more nuanced assessment of the situation (e.g., considering the context and invoking empathy, etc.).{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18157">According to the [[United States Office of Government Ethics]], a '''political appointee''' is "any employee who is appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], or agency head".  As of 2016, there are around 4,000 political appointment positions which an incoming administration needs to review, and fill or confirm, of which about 1,200 require Senate confirmation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These positions are published in the ''[[United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions]]'' (Plum Book), a new edition of which is released after each [[United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plum Book: About|url=https://m.gpo.gov/plumbook/|publisher=Government Publishing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Types ==
There are four basic categories of political appointments:

* '''Presidential appointments with Senate confirmation (PAS)''': These positions require a [[United States congressional hearing|congressional hearing]] and a confirmation vote of the full Senate under the [[Appointments Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1251_ed9g.pdf NLRB v. SW General, Inc.]'', no. 15-1251 (March 21, 2017) (U.S. Supreme Court)&lt;/ref&gt; As at 2016, PAS positions included [[List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation|1,212 senior positions]], including the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] secretaries and their subordinates at the Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary, and Assistant Secretary levels; the heads of most [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agencies]]; and [[Ambassadors of the United States|ambassadors]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://presidentialtransition.org/blog/posts/160316_help-wanted-4000-appointees.php|title=Help Wanted: 4,000 Presidential Appointees|last=Piaker|first=Zach|date=2016-03-16|work=|newspaper=[[Partnership for Public Service]] Center for Presidential Transition|access-date=2016-11-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes [[United States Attorney|United States Attorneys]] and [[United States Marshals Service|United States Marshals]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/14/opinion/donald-trump-is-now-hiring.html|title=Donald Trump Is Now Hiring|last=The Editorial Board|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011]] reclassified about 170 PAS positions to PA, to no longer needing Senate confirmation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fcw.com/articles/2012/11/09/hire-presidential-appointees.aspx|title=How to become a presidential appointee|last=Tuutti|first=Camille|date=2012-11-09|website=FCW|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[ttps://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2012/08/obama-signs-bill-giving-him-more-power-over-appointments-132463 Obama signs bill giving him more power over appointments]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Presidential appointments without Senate confirmation (PA)''': These appointments do not require a Senate hearing or vote.  As at 2016, there were 353 PA positions, most of which were in the [[Executive Office of the President]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''Non-career Senior Executive Service (NA)''': The [[Senior Executive Service (United States)|Senior Executive Service]] (SES) forms the level just below the presidential appointees.  While the SES largely consists of career officials, up to 10%, or (as of 2016) 680 positions, can be political appointees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''Schedule C appointments (SC)''': [[Schedule C appointment|Schedule C appointees]] serve in confidential or policy roles immediately subordinate to other appointees.  As of 2016, there are 1,403 Schedule C appointees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Unlike the presidential appointments, the non-career SES and Schedule C appointments tend to be made within each agency and then approved by the [[Office of Presidential Personnel]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Ethics restrictions ==
Political appointees, referring broadly to anyone appointed by the President, the Vice President, or agency head, are subject to more ethics restrictions than regular executive-branch employees. There are two categories of appointees, and each category is subject to additional and slightly different ethics restrictions.&lt;ref name="oge" /&gt;
* The [[spoils system]]/patronage system is a practice where a political party, after winning an election, gives government jobs to its supporters, friends and relatives as a reward for working toward victory, and as an incentive to keep working for the party as opposed to a merit system, where offices are awarded on the basis of some measure of merit independent of political activity.
* The [[merit system]] is the process of promoting and hiring government employees based on their ability to perform a job, rather than on their political connections. It is the opposite of the spoils system. A common conception of the federal government's merit system principles is that they are designed to ensure fair and open recruitment and competition and employment practices free of political influence or other non-merit factors. Although that is certainly true, a closer reading of those principles suggests a much broader policy objective that relates directly to managing the ongoing performance of the federal workforce.
Political appointees are required to take an ethics pledge not to accept gifts from [[lobbyists]]. This is because of [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 13490 Under [[s:Executive_Order_12674#Sec._102._Limitations_on_Outside_Earned_Income|Section 102]] of Executive Order 12674, political appointees who are appointed by the president are not allowed to receive any income from outside employment or activities.&lt;ref name="oge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Appointees|url=http://www.oge.gov/Topics/Selected-Employee-Categories/Political-Appointees/|publisher=U.S. Office of Government Ethics|accessdate=2013-11-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217212029/http://oge.gov/Topics/Selected-Employee-Categories/Political-Appointees/|archivedate=2013-12-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exceptions to the gift rule include:

* 	Positions within a [[White House]] operating unit that is designated as not normally subject to change as a result of a presidential transition
* 	Positions within the [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]]
* 	[[U.S. Foreign Service]] positions that do not require Senate confirmation
Political appointees sometimes attempt to transfer to a career position in the [[competitive service]], [[excepted service]], or [[Senior Executive Service (United States)|Senior Executive Service]].  This practice, known as "burrowing in", is desired by employees due to increased pay and job security, as career positions do not end when a presidential administration changes.  As these appointed positions are selected noncompetitively, while career employees are supposed to be selected on the basis of [[Meritocracy|merit]] and without political influence, these conversions are subject to extra scrutiny.  Since 2010, such conversions require advance approval from OPM, and the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) periodically audits the conversions.  In 2008, members of Congress criticized the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] and [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] for improperly allowing political employees to convert to career positions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitehousetransitionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Appointment-to-Career-Conversions_110212-1.pdf|title=Conversion of Employees from Appointed (Noncareer) Positions to Career Positions in the Executive Branch|last=Schwemle|first=Barbara L.|date=2012-11-02|website=|publisher=Congressional Research Service|pages=1, 5, 8|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the politics of the United States, the system of political appointments comes from a history of the [[spoils system]] (also known as a [[patronage system]]) which is a practice where a political party, after winning an election, gives government jobs to its supporters, friends and relatives as a reward for working toward victory. The term was derived from the phrase "to the victor belong the spoils" by New York Senator [[William L. Marcy]], referring to the victory of the [[Jackson Democrats]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1828|election of 1828]], with the term "spoils" meaning goods or benefits taken from the loser in a competition, election or military victory. Though it is commonly assumed that the patronage system in the United States first came into general use during [[Andrew Jackson]]'s presidency, it actually has an older history. President [[Thomas Jefferson]], a [[Democratic-Republican]], favored a policy of keeping rival [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]] out of government.

The patronage system thrived in the U.S. federal government until 1883. In 1820 [[United States Congress|Congress]] limited federal administrators to four-year terms, which led to constant turnover; by the 1860s and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], patronage had led to widespread inefficiency and political corruption. Although it used to be confined to cabinet positions, department heads, and foreign ambassadorships, by the 1860s patronage had spread to low-level government positions. This meant that when the incumbent political party lost a presidential election, the federal government underwent wholesale turnover.

On July 2, 1881, [[Charles J. Guiteau]], a disaffected and mentally unstable political office seeker, [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|assassinated]] President [[James Garfield]]. This highlighted how much the patronage problem had gotten out of control, and shifted public opinion, convincing the United States that the President of the United States had more important things to do than to engage in patronage. Congress was eventually spurred to pass the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] of 1883,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patronage|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/lib/student_work/florence96/jessdave/patronage.html|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which created a [[Civil Service Commission]] and advocated a [[merit system]] for selecting government employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Garfield: A Biography|last = Peskin|first = Allan|publisher = Kent State University Press|year = 1976|isbn = 978-0873382106|location = Kent, OH|pages = 591|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SRmY164czTQC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, passage of the [[Hatch Act of 1939|Hatch Act]] of 1939 forbade the intimidation or bribery of voters and restricted political campaign activities by federal employees. It prohibited using any public funds designated for relief or public works for electoral purposes. It forbade officials paid with federal funds from using promises of jobs, promotion, financial assistance, contracts, or any other benefit to coerce campaign contributions or political support, which restricted most partisan political activities of federal employees. By 1980, 90% of federal positions had become part of the civil service system, which lead to state and local governments to employed large patronage systems. Big-city political machines in places such as [[New York City]], [[Boston]], and [[Chicago]] thrived in the late nineteenth century. Being as a patronage system not only rewarded political supporters for past support, it also encouraged future support, because persons who have a patronage job would try to retain it by campaigning for the party at the next election. Large-scale patronage systems declined steadily during the twentieth century. During the [[Progressive Era]] (1900–1920), "good government" reformers overthrew political machines and installed civil service systems. Chicago, under Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]], remained the last bastion of patronage, existing in its purest form until the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti- Corruption Report|url=http://www.uic.edu/depts/pols/ChicagoPolitics/AntiCorruptionReport_4.pdf|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In today’s more observant standards, politicians wanted to pull away from the negative intonation of the name casting of Patronage, and Spoil system which led them to rename the process “Political Appointments”.

==Issues==
The United States has more political appointees in government than any other industrialized democracy in the world. Even though the United States has one of the largest populations of political appointees in the system, the efficiency of political appointees is constantly shifting. Political appointees are engraved in everyday decisions even making the final call on major events. As of 2013, the [[The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] was lacking a Senate-confirmed adminitrator since 2006 when [[Marilyn Tavenner]] was acting administrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meyer|first=Theodoric|title=Under Obama, More Appointments Go Unfilled|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/under-obama-more-appointments-go-unfilled#filibuster-correx|publisher=ProPublica|accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 60 positions for appointment remain vacant and 45 positions have remained vacant for more than a year.

Judicial vacancies have also become a problem as well with numerous open seats for circuit and district judges left to be filled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bendery|first=Jennifer|title=Judicial Vacancies Skyrocket During President Obama's First Term|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/02/judicial-vacancies-obama_n_2228978.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=15 November 2013|date=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of President Obama's first term, thirteen percent of presidential-appointee positions had not been filled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|title=Plum Book|year=2012|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012/pdf/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political appointees also come under heat for their own actions including [[Ben Bernanke]]'s involvement with private banks and also [[Michael D.

Gallo and Lewis stated that they thought careerist and appointees should work in a balanced atmosphere to be more productive and share skills. Professional rapport between careerists and appointees is considered in a study of presidential environmental appointees by Matthew Auer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Auer|first=Matthew|journal=Public Administration Review|date=7 January 2008|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00838.x/full|accessdate=2013-11-21|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00838.x|title=Presidential Environmental Appointees in Comparative Perspective|volume=68|issue=1|pages=68–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auer found that oft-mentioned problems in the appointment system, such as short time-in-office and lack of government experience were less pronounced among top federal environmental appointees, across both Republican and Democratic administrations.

{{Sociology}}
In [[sociology]], the '''popularity''' of a person, idea, item or other concept can be defined in terms of liking, [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]], [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] and superiority. With respect to interpersonal popularity, there are two primary divisions: perceived and sociometric.

According to psychologist Tessa Lansu at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]], "Popularity [has] to do with being the middle point of a [[Social group|group]] and having [[Social influence|influence]] on it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ru.nl/sociology/@877216/popularity/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[File:Rebecca1917version.jpg|thumb|From the 1917 silent film ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'', this image shows one girl behaving with overt aggression towards another girl.]]

The term ''Popularity'' is borrowed from the Latin term ''popularis'', which originally meant "common." The current definition of the word popular, the "fact or condition of being well liked by the people", was first seen in 1601.&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=popular Etymology Online entry for Popular], 5 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

While popularity is a trait often ascribed to an individual, it is an inherently social phenomenon and thus can only be understood in the context of groups of people. Popularity is a collective perception, and individuals report the consensus of a group's feelings towards an individual or object when rating popularity. It takes a group of people to like something, so the more that people advocate for something or claim that someone is best liked, the more attention it will get, and the more popular it will be deemed.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;Scott, B. A., &amp; Judge, T. A. (2009). The popularity contest at work: Who wins, why, and what do they receive? ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 94(1), 20-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the above, popularity as a concept can be applied, assigned, or directed towards objects such as songs, movies, websites, activities, soaps, foods etc. Together, these objects collectively make up [[popular culture]], or the consensus of mainstream preferences in society. In essence, anything, human or non-human, can be deemed popular.

== Types of interpersonal popularity ==

For many years, popularity research focused on a definition of popularity that was based on being "well liked." Eventually, it was discovered that those who are ''perceived'' as popular are not necessarily the most well liked as originally assumed. When students are given the opportunity to freely elect those they like most and those they perceive as popular, a discrepancy often emerges.&lt;ref name="Lansu"&gt;Lansu, T. M., &amp; Cillessen, A.

''Journal of Adolescent Research'', 27(1), 132-150.&lt;/ref&gt; This is evidence that there are two main forms of personal popularity that social psychology recognizes, [[Sociometric status|sociometric]] popularity and perceived popularity.&lt;ref name=Cillessen-Rose&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cillessen |first1=Antonius |author2=Amanda J.

=== Sociometric popularity ===
Sociometric popularity can be defined by how liked an individual is. This ''liking'' is correlated with [[Prosocial behavior|prosocial behaviours]]. Those who act in prosocial ways are likely to be deemed sociometrically popular. Often they are known for their interpersonal abilities, their [[empathy]] for others, and their willingness to [[Cooperation|cooperate]] non-aggressively.&lt;ref name="Borch"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borch |first1=Casey |author2=Allen Hyde, Antonius H. N. Cillessen|title=The role of attractiveness and aggression in high school popularity|journal=Social Psychology of Education|date=13 May 2010|volume=14|issue=1|pages=23–39|doi=10.1007/s11218-010-9131-1|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11218-010-9131-1|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a more private judgement, characterized by likeability, that will not generally be shared in a group setting.  Often, it is impossible to know whom individuals find popular on this scale unless confidentiality is ensured.&lt;ref name="Lansu" /&gt;

=== Perceived popularity ===
Perceived popularity is used to describe those individuals who are known among their peers as being popular. Unlike sociometric popularity, perceived popularity is often associated with aggression and dominance and is not dependent on prosocial behaviors. This form of popularity is often explored by the popular media. Notable works dealing with perceived popularity include ''[[Mean Girls]]'', ''[[Odd Girl Out]]'', and ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''. Individuals who have perceived popularity are often highly socially visible and frequently emulated but rarely liked.&lt;ref name=Cillessen-Rose /&gt; Since perceived popularity is a measure of visible reputation and emulation, this form of popularity is most openly discussed, agreed upon within a group, and what most people refer to when they call someone popular.&lt;ref name="Lansu" /&gt;

==Comprehensive theories==

To date, only one comprehensive theory of interpersonal popularity has been proposed: that of A. L. Freedman in the book ''[http://www.popularityexplained.com/ Popularity Explained].''  The 3 Factor Model proposed attempts to reconcile the two concepts of sociometric and perceived popularity by combining them orthogonally and providing distinct definitions for each. In doing so, it reconciles the counter intuitive fact that liking does not guarantee perceived popularity nor does perceived popularity guarantee being well liked.

==="Popularity Explained"===

'[http://www.popularityexplained.com/ 'Popularity Explained']' was first published as a blog before being converted to a book and various versions have been available on Amazon since 2013.

====Conceptual foundations====
There are four primary concepts that ''Popularity Explained'' relies on.

#'''Liking and attraction are not the same.''' The interpersonal feeling of "liking" is not the same as "attraction" and that both are responsible for different human behaviours. The neurological evidence of this comes from the research of [[Kent C. Berridge]] and his [[incentive salience]] model. ''Popularity Explained'' extrapolates the conclusions of this research and applies it to human-human interpersonal interactions.
#'''A hierarchy of interpersonal attraction exists in all social groups.''' ''Popularity Explained'' develops a very broad definition of [[interpersonal attraction]] asserting that it is based on a multitude of different factors but primarily those of: socioeconomic status; interpersonal similarity; physical appearance; and efficacy. It proposes the concept of a "Hierarchy of Attraction" which, in simple terms, is just a stylized bell curve that illustrates how attractive people are relative to each other in terms of a percentile.
#'''Interpersonal attraction (in the broadest sense) results in Input of Energy.''' Input of Energy is the interpersonal actions that an individual takes, consciously and unconsciously, when they experience an interpersonal attraction. Examples of Input of Energy given in the book include: attempts at physical proximity; changes in verbal communications; changes to non-verbal communication; biased interpersonal judgements; cognitive intrusion; and helping behaviour.
#'''Sociometric and perceived popularity are correlated but not equivalent.''' By combining these two concepts, ''Popularity Explained'' defines eight prototypical student types that can be plotted on the single graph.

====Three-factor model====

According to Freedman, an individual's place in the social landscape is determined by a combination of three factors: ''what'' they are; ''who'' they are; and the situation.
 
#''What'' refers to all those aspects of a person that are objective: participation in sports, physical appearance, etc. Perceived popularity is primarily the result of what a person is. It is mediated by Input of Energy combining with the Hierarchy of Attraction. This preferential receipt of Input of Energy by a select few is what propels them to the "popular" side of the graph that combines sociometric and perceived popularity. 
#''Who'' refers to the personality of the individual and how they treat other people. It is this factor that is responsible for determining where a student sits along the "liking" and "disliking" dimensions that characterize a student. The more pro-social an individual, the more they will be liked. 
#The Situation refers to the circumstances that an individual finds themself in. Different circumstances may result in different social outcomes. For example, the same student may be perceived as popular when in the social context of their church youth group but unpopular within the social context of their school as a whole.

== Interpersonal causes ==
[[File:1922 Locust yearbook p. 171 (Popularity).jpg|thumb|"Popularity" artwork featured in [[East Texas State Normal College]]'s 1922 ''Locust'' yearbook]]

One of the most widely agreed upon theories about what leads to an increased level of popularity for an individual is the perceived value which that individual brings to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=Joseph|author2=Fişek, M. Hamit|title=Diffuse Status Characteristics and the Spread of Status Value: A Formal Theory|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=1 January 2006 |volume=111|issue=4|pages=1038–1079|doi=10.1086/498633 |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/498633?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103978062153 |deadurl=no |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be true for members of all groups, but is especially demonstrable in groups that exist for a specific purpose. For example, sports teams exist with the goal of being successful in competitions against other sports teams. Study groups exist so that the members of the group can mutually benefit from one another's academic knowledge. In these situations, leaders often emerge because other members of the group perceive them as adding a lot of value to the group as a whole. On a sports team, this means that the best players are usually elected captain and in study groups people might be more inclined to like an individual who has a lot of knowledge to share.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt; It has been argued that this may be a result of our evolutionary tendencies to favor individuals who are most likely to aid in our own survival.&lt;ref name=Kanazawa&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kanazawa |first1=Satoshi |author2=Jody L Kovar|title=Why beautiful people are more intelligent|journal=Intelligence|date=May–June 2004|volume=32|issue=3|pages=227–243|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289604000352|accessdate=7 November 2012|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2004.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also of note that the actual value which an individual brings to a group is not of consequence in determining his or her popularity; the only thing that is important is his or her value as perceived by the other members of the group. While perceived value and actual value may often overlap, this is not a requisite and it has been shown that there are instances in which an individual's actual value is relatively low, but they are perceived as highly valuable nevertheless.&lt;ref name=Mulford /&gt;

=== Attractiveness ===
[[Physical attractiveness|Attractiveness]], specifically physical attractiveness, has been shown to have very profound effects on popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Bruyn |first1=Eddy H. |author2=van den Boom, Dymphna C.|title=Interpersonal Behavior, Peer Popularity, and Self-esteem in Early Adolescence|journal=Social Development|date=1 November 2005|volume=14|issue=4|pages=555–573|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9507.2005.00317.x
|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9507.2005.00317.x/full|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People who are physically attractive are more likely to be thought of as possessing positive traits. People who are attractive are expected to perform better on tasks and are more likely to be trusted.&lt;ref name=Mulford&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mulford|first1=Mathew|author2=John Orbell, Catherine Shatto, and Jean Stockard|title=Physical Attractiveness, Opportunity, and Success in Everyday Exchange|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=May 1998|volume=103|issue=6|pages=1565–1592|doi=10.1086/231401|jstor=10.1086/231401}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, they are judged to possess many other positive traits such as mental health, intelligence, social awareness, and dominance.&lt;ref name=Feingold&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feingold|first=Alan|title=Good-looking people are not what we think|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=March 1992|volume=111|issue=2|pages=304–341|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.2.304 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.2.304 |deadurl=no |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, people who are of above average attractiveness are assumed to also be of above average value to the group. Research shows that attractive people are often perceived to have many positive traits based on nothing other than their looks, regardless of how accurate these perceptions are.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster Jr.|first1=Murray|author2=James E. Driskell, Jr.|title=Beauty as Status|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=July 1983|volume=89|issue=1|pages=140–165|jstor=2779050|doi=10.1086/227836}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is known as the [[Halo effect]]&lt;ref name=Mulford /&gt; This means that, in addition to being more well-liked, attractive people are more likely to be seen as bringing actual value to the group, even when they may be of little or no value at all. In essence, physically attractive people are given the benefit of the doubt while less attractive individuals must prove that they are bringing value to the group.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt;  It has been shown empirically that being physically attractive is correlated with both sociometric and perceived popularity. Some possible explanations for this include increased social visibility and an increased level of tolerance for aggressive, social interactions that may increase perceived popularity.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt;

=== Aggression ===
The degree to which an individual is perceived as popular is often highly correlated with the level of aggression with which that individual interacts with his or her peers. There are two main categories of aggression, relational and overt, both of which have varying consequences for popularity depending on several factors, such as the gender and attractiveness of the aggressor.&lt;ref name=Crick&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crick |first1=Nicki R. |last2=Grotpeter|first2=Jennifer K.|title=Relational Aggression, Gender, and Social-Psychological Adjustment |journal=Child Development|date=1 June 1995|&lt;!-- year=2008 ???--&gt;|volume=66|issue=3|pages=710–722|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1995.tb00900.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relational aggression ====
[[Relational aggression]] is nonviolent aggression that is emotionally damaging to another individual. Examples of relationally aggressive activities include ignoring or excluding an individual from a group, delivering personal insults to another person, and the spreading of rumors. Relational aggression is more frequently used by females than males.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt;

It has been found that relational aggression almost always has a strongly negative relationship with sociometric popularity but can have a positive relationship with perceived popularity depending on the perceived level of attractiveness of the aggressor. For an aggressor who is perceived as unattractive, relational aggression, by both males and females, leads to less perceived popularity. For an attractive aggressor however, relational aggression has been found to actually have a positive relationship with perceived popularity.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt;

The relationship between attractiveness and aggression is further intertwined by the finding that increased levels of physical attractiveness actually further decreased the sociometric popularity of relationally aggressive individuals.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt;

In short, the more physically attractive an individual is, the more likely they are to experience decreased levels of sociometric popularity but increased levels of perceived popularity for engaging in relationally aggressive activities.

==== Overt aggression ====
Overt aggression is aggression that involves individuals physically interacting with each other in acts such as pushing, hitting, kicking or otherwise causing physical harm or submission in the other person. This includes threats of violence and physical intimidation as well.

It has been shown that overt aggression directly leads to perceived popularity when the aggressor is attractive.&lt;ref name=Cillessen-Rose /&gt; Experiments that are controlled for levels of physical attractiveness show that individuals who are attractive and overtly aggressive have a higher degree of perceived popularity than attractive non-overtly aggressive individuals. This was found to be true to a small degree for females and a large degree for males.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt;

Attractive individuals who are overtly aggressive barely suffer any consequences in terms of sociometric popularity. This is a key difference between overt and relational aggression because relational aggression has a strongly negative relationship on sociometric popularity, especially for attractive individuals. For unattractive individuals, there is again a strongly negative relationship between overt aggression and sociometric popularity.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt; This means that attractive individuals stand to gain a lot of perceived popularity at the cost of very little sociometric popularity by being overtly aggressive while unattractive individuals stand to gain very little perceived popularity from acts of overt aggression but will be heavily penalized with regards to sociometric popularity.

=== Cultural factors ===
According to Talcott Parsons, as rewritten by Fons Trompenaars,
there are four main types of culture : marked by love/hate (Middle East, Mediterranean, Latin America) approval/criticism (United Kingdom, Canada, Scandinavia, Germanic countries) esteem/contempt (Japan, Eastern Asia). The last one, responsiveness/rejection, is typical for the United States. 
&lt;br /&gt;
There is no effort for popularity in Northern or Southern Europe, Latin America or Asia. This emotional bonding is specific for the high schools of the United States. 
In the love/hate cultures, the family and close friends are more important than popularity. In the approval/criticism cultures, actions are more important than persons, no strong links develop during school.

=== Demographic differences ===

==== Maturity ====
Popularity is gauged primarily through social status.  Because of the importance of social status, peers play the primary role in social decision making so that individuals can increase the chances that others like them.  However, as children, individuals tend to do this through friendship, academics, and interpersonal conduct.&lt;ref name="Adler" /&gt;  By adulthood, work and romantic relationships become much more important. This peer functioning and gaining popularity is a key player in increasing interest in social networks and groups in the workplace.  To succeed in such a work environment, adults then place popularity as a higher priority than any other goal, even romance.&lt;ref name="Lansu"/&gt;

==== Gender ====
These two types of popularity, perceived popularity and sociometric popularity, are more correlated for girls than they are for boys. However, it is said that men can possess these qualities to a larger extent, making them more likely to be a leader, more powerful, and more central in a group, but also more likely than women to be socially excluded.&lt;ref name="Lansu" /&gt;  Boys tend to become popular based on athletic ability, coolness, toughness, and interpersonal skills; however, the more popular a boy gets, the worse he tends to do on his academic work.  On the other hand, this negative view of academics is not seen at all in popular girls, who gain popularity based on family background (primarily socioeconomic status), physical appearance, and social ability. Boys are also known to be more competitive and rule focused, whereas girls have more emotional intimacy.&lt;ref name="Adler"&gt;Adler, P. A., Kless, S. J., &amp; Adler, P. (1992). Socialization to gender roles: Popularity among elementary school boys and girls. ''Sociology Of Education'', 65(3), 169-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Race ====
In some instances, it has been found that in predominantly white high schools, attractive non-white students are on average significantly more sociometrically popular than equally attractive white students. One theory that has been put forth to explain this phenomenon is a high degree of [[group cohesiveness]] among minority students compared with the relative lack of cohesion amongst members of the majority.  Since there is more cohesion, there is more availability for one person to be liked by many since they are all in contact.  This acts like [[Zipf's Law]], where the cohesion is a confounding factor that forces the greater links in the smaller minority, causing them to be more noticed and thus more popular.&lt;ref name=Card&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Noel|title=Modeling Dyadic and Interdependent Data in the Developmental and Behavioral Sciences |location=New York, NY|pages=61–86|author2=Antonius Cillessen|authorlink=Analyzing social networks in adolescence|author3=Casey Borch |date=1 July 2008 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.2.304 |deadurl=no |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering race as a predictor for perceived popularity by asking a class how popular and important each other person is, African American students were rated most popular by their peers.  Popularity in race was found to be correlated with athleticism, and because African Americans have a stereotype of being better at sports than individuals of other races, they are viewed as more popular. Additionally, White and Hispanic children were rated as more popular the better they succeeded in school and came from a higher socioeconomic background. No single factor can explain popularity, but instead the interaction between many factors such as race and athleticism vs. academics.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;Kennedy, E. (1995). Correlates of perceived popularity among peers: A study of race and gender differences among middle school students. ''The Journal of Negro Education'', 64, 186-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of popularity in the workplace ==

=== Importance ===
More tasks in the workplace are being done in teams, leading to a greater need of people to seek and feel social approval.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt; In academic settings, a high social standing among peers is associated with positive academic outcomes.&lt;ref name="Eder"&gt;Eder, D. (1985). The cycle of popularity: Interpersonal relations among female adolescents. Sociology Of Education, 58(3), 154-165.&lt;/ref&gt; Popularity also leads to students in academic environments to receive more help, have more positive relationships and stereotypes, and be more approached by peers.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt; While this is the research found in schools, it is likely to be generalized to a workplace.

=== Benefits ===
Popularity is positively linked to job satisfaction, individual job performance, and group performance.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt;  The popular worker, besides just feeling more satisfied with his job, feels more secure, believes he has better working conditions, trusts his supervisor, and possesses more positive opportunities for communication with both management and co-workers, causing a greater feeling of responsibility and belongingness at work.&lt;ref name="SVan"&gt;SVan Zelst, R. H. (1951). Worker popularity and job satisfaction. ''Personnel Psychology'', 4, 405-412.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others prefer to work with popular individuals, most notably in manual labor jobs because, although they might not be the most knowledgeable for the job, they are approachable, willing to help, cooperative in group work, and are more likely to treat their coworkers as an equal.  If an employee feels good-natured, genial, but not overly independent, more people will say that they most prefer to work with that employee.&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;Porter, L. W., &amp; Ghiselli, E. E. (1960). A self-description scale measuring sociometric popularity among manual workers. ''Personnel Psychology'', 13, 141-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contributing factors ===
According to the [[mere-exposure effect]], employees in more central positions that must relate to many others throughout the day, such as a manager, are more likely to be considered popular.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt;
There are many characteristics that contribute to popularity:&lt;ref name="Hawkins"&gt;Hawkins, K. (2012). Why Popularity At Work Matters And How To Achieve It. Officepro, 72(2), 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Expressing and acting in genuine ways - others will turn away if they can detect that someone is being fake to them
*Focusing on positive energy - others will feel too drained to be around someone if their interactions are not started on a positive note or they don't have empathy to share in someone else's positive news
*Treating others with respect - others do not like to be around someone if they aren't treated equally and acknowledged for their hard work
*Create connections - others are more likely to approach individuals they have strong relationships with; these can be built by talking about more personal issues, attending work gatherings, and communicating outside the office walls
*Patience - turning away too quickly ignores that relationships take time to grow, especially in the busy and stressful environments that work often induces
*Incorporating others - others feel a sense of trust and belongingness when they are asked for help on a project&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt;
*Hands-on or servant leader- Its a person that will do the work before anyone else, be the first to do the less desirable  jobs, and have a positive  attitude  about it.

=== Leadership popularity ===
With a greater focus on groups in the workplace, it is essential that leaders effectively deal with and mediate groups to avoid clashing. Sometimes a leader does not need to be popular to be effective, but there are a few characteristics that can help a leader be more accepted and better liked by his group. Without group or team cohesiveness, there is no correlation between leadership and popularity; however, when a group is cohesive, the higher up someone is in the leadership hierarchy, the more popular they are for two reasons.&lt;ref name="Theodorson"&gt;Theodorson, G. A. (1957). The relationship between leadership and popularity roles in small groups. ''American Sociological Review'', 22, 58-67.&lt;/ref&gt;  First, a cohesive group feels more personal responsibility for their work, thus placing more value on better performance. Cohesive members see leaders as taking a bulk of the work and investing a lot of personal time, so when they see a job's value they can ascribe its success to the leader. This greatest contribution principle is perceived as a great asset to the team, and members view the leader more favorably and he gains popularity.&lt;ref name="Theodorson" /&gt; Secondly, cohesive groups have well established group values. Leaders can become more popular in these groups by realizing and acting on dominant group values.  Supporting group morals and standards leads to high positive valuation from the group, leading to popularity.&lt;ref name="Turk"&gt;Turk, H. (1961). Instrumental values and the popularity of instrumental leaders. ''Social Forces'', 39, 252-260.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The popularity of objects as a consequence of social influence ==

=== Information cascades ===
Poplularity is a term widely applicable to the modern era thanks primarily to social networking technology. Being "liked" has been taken to a completely different level on ubiquitous sites such as [[Facebook]].

Popularity is a social phenomenon but it can also be ascribed to objects that people interact with. Collective attention is the only way to make something popular, and information cascades play a large role in rapid rises in something's popularity. Rankings for things in popular culture, like movies and music, often do not reflect the public's taste, but rather the taste of the first few buyers because [[social influence]] plays a large role in determining what is popular and what is not through an [[information cascade]].

Information cascades have strong influence causing individuals to imitate the actions of others, whether or not they are in agreement. For example, when downloading music, people don't decide 100% independently which songs to buy. Often they are influenced by charts depicting which songs are already trending.  Since people rely on what those before them do, one can manipulate what becomes popular among the public by manipulating a website's download rankings.&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;, Cornell Course INFO 2040 blog. (2011). Information Cascade in Music. ''Networks''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Experts paid to predict sales often fail but not because they are bad at their jobs; instead, it is because they cannot control the information cascade that ensues after first exposure by consumers. Music is again, an excellent example. Good songs rarely perform poorly on the charts and poor songs rarely perform very well, but there is tremendous variance that still makes predicting the popularity of any one song very difficult.&lt;ref name="Salganik"&gt;Salganik, J. (2006). Experimental Study of Inequality and Unpredictability in and Artificial Cultural Market. ''Science'', 311, 854-856.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts can determine if a product will sell in the top 50% of related products or not, but it is difficult to be more specific than that. Due to the strong impact that influence plays, this evidence emphasizes the need for marketers. They have a significant opportunity to show their products in the best light, with the most famous people, or being in the media most often. Such constant exposure is a way of gaining more product followers. Marketers can often make the difference between an average product and a popular product. However, since popularity is primarily constructed as a general consensus of a group's attitude towards something, [[Word-of-mouth marketing|word-of-mouth]] is a more effective way to attract new attention.  Websites and blogs start by recommendations from one friend to another, as they move through social networking services. Eventually, when the fad is large enough, the media catches on to the craze. This spreading by word-of-mouth is the social information cascade that allows something to grow in usage and attention throughout a social group until everyone is telling everyone else about it, at which point it is deemed popular.&lt;ref name="Leskovec"&gt;Leskovec, J., Singh, A., and Kleinberg, J. Patterns of Influence in a Recommendation Network.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals also rely on what others say when they know that the information they are given could be completely incorrect. This is known as [[groupthink]].  Relying on others to influence one's own decisions is a very powerful social influence, but can have negative impacts.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, L. and Holt, C. (1997). Information cascades in the laboratory ''The American Economic Review'', 87, 847-863.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zipf's Law ===
[[File:Facebook popularity.PNG|thumb|left|The popularity of [[Facebook]] over time illustrating Zipf's Law]]

The popularity of many different things can be described by [[Zipf's Law|Zipf's powerlaw]] which posits that there is a low frequency of very large quantities and a high frequency of low quantities. This illustrates popularity of many different objects.

For example, there are few very popular websites, but many websites have small followings. This is the result of interest; as many people use e-mail, it is common for sites like [[Yahoo!]] to be accessed by large numbers of people; however, a small subset of people would be interested in a blog on a particular [[video game]].  In this situation, only Yahoo! would be deemed a popular site by the public.&lt;ref name="Adamic"&gt;Adamic, L. (2002). Zipf, power-laws, and pareto-a ranking tutorial.  ''Glottometrics'', 3, 143-150.&lt;/ref&gt;  This can additionally be seen in [[social networking service]]s, such as [[Facebook]]. The majority of people have about 130 friends, while very few people have larger social networks.  However, some individuals do have more than 5,000 friends. This reflects that very few people can be extremely well-connected, but many people are somewhat connected. The number of friends a person has, has been a way to determine how popular an individual is, so the small number of people who have an extremely high number of friends is a way of using social networking services, like Facebook, to illustrate how only a few people are deemed popular.&lt;ref name="dunbar"&gt;Dunbar, R. (2010). You've got to have (150) friends. ''New York Times'' December 25&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

Popular people may not be those who are best liked interpersonally by their peers, but they do receive most of the positive behavior from coworkers when compared to nonpopular workers.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt; This is a result of the differences between sociometric and perceived popularity. When asked who is most popular, employees typically respond based on perceived popularity; however, they really prefer the social interactions with those who are more sociometrically popular.  For each individual to ensure that they are consistent with the group's popularity consensus, those who are high in perceived popularity are treated with the same positive behaviors as those who are more interpersonally, but privately, liked by specific individuals. Well-liked workers are most likely to get salary increases and promotions, while disliked (unpopular) workers are the first to get their salary cut back or laid off during recessions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

During interactions with others in the work environment, more popular individuals receive more organizational citizenship behavior (helping and courteousness from others) and less counter productive work behavior (rude reactions and withheld information) than those who are considered less popular in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt; Coworkers agree with each other on who is and who is not popular and, as a group, treat popular coworkers more favorably. While popularity has proven to be a big determiner of getting more positive feedback and interactions from coworkers, such a quality matters less in organizations where workloads and interdependence is high, such as the medical field.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt;

In many instances, physical appearance has been used as one indicator of popularity. Attractiveness plays a large role in the workplace and physical appearance influences hiring, whether or not the job might benefit from it. For example, some jobs, such as salesperson, benefit from attractiveness when it comes down to the bottom line, but there have been many studies which have shown that, in general, attractiveness is not at all a valid predictor of on-the-job performance.&lt;ref name="Shahani"&gt;Shahani-Denning, C., Dudhat, P., Tevet, R., &amp; Andreoli, N. (2010). Effect of Physical Attractiveness on Selection Decisions in India and the United States. ''International Journal of Management'', 27(1), 37-51.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many individuals have previously thought this was only a phenomenon in the more individualistic cultures of the Western world, but research has shown that attractiveness also plays a role in hiring in collectivist cultures as well.  Because of the prevalence of this problem during the hiring process in all cultures, researchers have recommended training a group to ignore such influencers, just like legislation has worked to control for differences in sex, race, and disabilities.&lt;ref name="Shahani" /&gt;

A '''solar chimney'''{{snd}} often referred to as a '''thermal chimney'''{{snd}} is a way of improving the natural [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] of [[building]]s by using [[convection]] of [[air]] heated by [[passive solar]] [[energy]]. A simple description of a solar chimney is that of a vertical shaft utilizing solar energy to enhance the natural [[Natural ventilation#Stack driven ventilation|stack ventilation]] through a building.

The [[Solar power|solar]] [[chimney]] has been in use for centuries, particularly in the [[Middle east]] and [[Near East]] by the [[Persian people|Persians]], as well as in [[Europe]] by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

==Description==
In its simplest form, the solar chimney consists of a black-painted [[chimney]]. During the day solar energy heats the chimney and the air within it, creating an [[updraft]] of air in the chimney. The [[suction]] created at the chimney's base can be used to ventilate and cool the building below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Solar powered Air Conditioning | url = http://www.sxlist.com/techref/other/spac.htm#Vent | accessdate = 2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most parts of the world it is easier to harness [[wind power]] for such ventilation as with a [[windcatcher]], but on hot windless days a Solar chimney can provide ventilation where otherwise there would be none.

There are however a number of solar chimney variations. The basic design elements of a solar chimney are:

* The solar collector area: This can be located in the top part of the chimney or can include the entire shaft. The orientation, type of glazing, insulation and thermal properties of this element are crucial for harnessing, retaining and utilizing solar gains.
* The main ventilation shaft: The location, height, cross section and the thermal properties of this structure are also very important.
* The inlet and outlet air apertures: The sizes, location as well as aerodynamic aspects of these elements are also significant.

A [[principle]] has been proposed for [[solar power]] generation, using a large [[greenhouse]] at the base rather than relying solely on heating the chimney itself. (For further information on this issue, see [[Solar updraft tower]].)

Solar chimneys are painted black so that they absorb the sun's heat more effectively. When the air inside the chimney is heated, it rises and pulls cold air out from under the ground via the heat exchange tubes.

== Solar chimney and [[sustainable architecture]] ==
[[File:solarchimney.svg|right|thumb|268px|This solar chimney draws air through a geothermal heat exchange to provide passive home cooling.&lt;ref&gt;"A Theory of Power" {{ISBN|0-595-33030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Vail | first = Jeff | title =  Passive Solar &amp; Independence | date = 2005-06-28 | url = http://www.jeffvail.net/2005/06/passive-solar-independence.html | accessdate = 2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Solar chimneys, also called heat chimneys or heat stacks, can also be used in architectural settings to decrease the energy used by mechanical systems (systems that heat and cool the building through mechanical means). Air conditioning and mechanical ventilation have been for decades the standard method of environmental control in many building types, especially offices, in developed countries. Pollution and reallocating energy supplies have led to a new environmental approach in building design. Innovative technologies along with bioclimatic principles and traditional design strategies are often combined to create new and potentially successful design solutions. The solar chimney is one of these concepts currently explored by scientists as well as designers, mostly through research and experimentation.

A solar chimney can serve many purposes.  Direct gain warms air inside the chimney causing it to rise out the top and drawing air in from the bottom. This drawing of air can be used to ventilate a home or office, to draw air through a geothermal heat exchange, or to ventilate only a specific area such as a composting toilet.

Natural ventilation can be created by providing vents in the upper level of a building to allow warm air to rise by [[convection]] and escape to the outside. At the same time cooler air can be drawn in through vents at the lower level.  Trees may be planted on that side of the building to provide shade for cooler outside air.

This natural ventilation process can be augmented by a solar chimney. The chimney has to be higher than the roof level, and has to be constructed on the wall facing the direction of the sun. Absorption of heat from the sun can be increased by using a [[glazing in construction|glazed]] surface on the side facing the sun. Heat absorbing material can be used on the opposing side. The size of the heat-absorbing surface is more important than the diameter of the chimney. A large surface area allows for more effective heat exchange with the air necessary for heating by solar radiation. Heating of the air within the chimney will enhance convection, and hence airflow through the chimney. Openings of the vents in the chimney should face away from the direction of the [[prevailing wind]].

To further maximize the cooling effect, the incoming air may be led through [[Earth cooling tubes|underground ducts]] before it is allowed to enter the building. The solar chimney can be improved by integrating it with a [[trombe wall]]. The added advantage of this design is that the system may be reversed during the cold season, providing solar heating instead.

A variation of the solar chimney concept is the solar [[attic]]. In a hot sunny climate the attic space is often blazingly hot in the summer. In a conventional building this presents a problem as it leads to the need for increased [[air conditioning]]. By integrating the attic space with a solar chimney, the hot air in the attic can be put to work. It can help the convection in the chimney, improving ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Murti Nugroho | first = Agung | author2=Mohd Hamdan bin Ahmad |author3=Makmal Sain Bangunan  | title = Possibility to Use Solar Induced Ventilation Strategies in Tropical Conditions by Computational Fluid Dynamic Simulation | url = http://eprints.utm.my/2315/1/17-Appendix_B.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of a solar chimney may benefit natural ventilation and passive cooling strategies of buildings thus help reduce energy use, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and pollution in general. Potential benefits regarding natural ventilation and use of solar chimneys are:

[[Image:Solar chimney TAS model.jpg|thumb|300px|CAD (TAS) Solar Chimney model]]
* improved ventilation rates on still, hot days
* reduced reliance on wind and wind driven ventilation
* improved control of air flow through a building
* greater choice of air intake (i.e. leeward side of building)
* improved air quality and reduced noise levels in urban areas
* increased night time ventilation rates
* ventilation of narrow, small spaces with minimal exposure to external elements

Potential benefits regarding passive cooling may include:

* improved passive cooling during warm season (mostly on still, hot days)
* improved night cooling rates
* enhanced performance of thermal mass (cooling, cool storage)
* improved thermal comfort (improved air flow control, reduced draughts)

==Precedent Study: The Environmental Building==
The [[Building Research Establishment]] (BRE) office building in Garston, Watford, United Kingdom, incorporates solar-assisted passive ventilation stacks as part of its ventilation strategy.

Designed by architects Feilden Clegg Bradley, the BRE offices aim to reduce energy consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 30% from current best practice guidelines and sustain comfortable environmental conditions without the use of air conditioning. The passive ventilation stacks, solar shading, and hollow concrete slabs with embedded under floor cooling are key features of this building. Ventilation and heating systems are controlled by the building management system (BMS) while a degree of user override is provided to adjust conditions to occupants' needs.

The building utilizes five vertical shafts as an integral part of the ventilation and cooling strategy. The main components of these stacks are a south facing glass-block wall, thermal mass walls and stainless steel round exhausts rising a few meters above roof level. The chimneys are connected to the curved hollow concrete floor slabs which are cooled via night ventilation. Pipes embedded in the floor can provide additional cooling utilizing groundwater.

On warm windy days air is drawn in through passages in the curved hollow concrete floor slabs. Stack ventilation naturally rising out through the stainless steel chimneys enhances the air flow through the building. The movement of air across the chimney tops enhances the stack effect.
During warm, still days, the building relies mostly on the stack effect while air is taken from the shady north side of the building. Low-energy fans in the tops of the stacks can also be used to improve airflow.

Overnight, control systems enable ventilation paths through the hollow concrete slab removing the heat stored during the day, which then remains cold for the following day. The exposed curved ceiling gives more surface area than a flat ceiling would, acting as a [[heat sink]], again providing summer cooling.
Research based on actual performance measurements of the passive stacks found that they enhanced the cooling ventilation of the space during warm and still days and may also have the potential to assist night-time cooling due to their thermally massive structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ní Riain | first = C. | author2=M.

==Passive down-draft cool tower==
[[Image:Zion Visitors Center Cool Tower.PNG|thumb|right|245px|Cool tower at Zion National Park's Visitor Center provides cool air]]
A technology closely related to the solar chimney is the evaporative down-draft cooltower. In areas with a hot, arid climate this approach may contribute to a sustainable way to provide [[air conditioning]] for buildings.

The principle is to allow water to evaporate at the top of a tower, either by using evaporative cooling pads or by spraying water. [[Evaporation]] cools the incoming air, causing a [[downdraft]] of cool air that will bring down the temperature inside the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Torcellini | first = Paul A. | author2=Ron Judkoff |author3=Sheila J.

The Visitor Center was designed by the High Performance Buildings Research of the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL).

The principle of the downdraft cooltower has been proposed for solar power generation as well. (See [[Energy tower (downdraft)|Energy tower]] for more information.)

Evaporation of moisture from the pads on top of the Toguna buildings built by the Dogon people of Mali, Africa contribute to the coolness felt by the men who rest underneath. The women's buildings on the outskirts of town are functional as more conventional solar chimneys.

'''State collapse''', '''breakdown''', or '''downfall''' is the complete failure of a mode of [[government]] within a [[sovereign state]]. Sometimes this brings about a [[failed state]], as in Somalia and the [[Yugoslav Wars|final decade]] of [[Yugoslavia]].  More often, there is an immediate process of transition to a new administration, and basic services such as tax collection, defence, police, civil service, and courts are maintained throughout, as in [[South Africa]] following the failure of the [[Apartheid|apartheid system]].

State collapse may coincide with [[economic collapse]].  State collapse is not always synonymous with [[societal collapse]], which often is a more prolonged process, as in the fall of the western Roman Empire. 

Not all attempts at [[regime change]] succeed in bringing about state collapse.  The 16th-century [[Babington plot]] to assassinate [[Queen Elizabeth I]] of England, the 19th-century [[Decembrist revolt]] in Russia, and the 20th-century [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] of Cuba failed.

==History of the concept==
For [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC), the inherent dangers of democracy were, first, that conflict between the aristocracy and the poor was inevitable; and second, that it would usher in "mischief and corruption". Both processes would lead to collapse unless independent controls and [[separation of powers]] were enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Przebowski, ''The Rise and Fall of the United States'', Ex Libris Corporation, 2009, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek philosopher [[Polybius]] (c.200 – c.118 BC) asserted that all nations follow a cycle of; democracy, oligarchy, dictatorship, tyranny and collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Przebowski]], ''The rise and fall of the United States, ExLibris Corporation'', 2009, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332 – 1406) also produced a general theory of state collapse. A "theological rationalist", he transformed the study of history into a "new science".&lt;ref&gt;[[J.J. Saunders]], review of 'Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History' by [[Muhsin Mahdi]], [[History and Theory]] vol 5, no 3, (1966), pp. 322-347.&lt;/ref&gt; In his eyes, dynasties repeatedly become "sedentary, senile, coercive, pompous, subservient to desire ... liable to divisions in the dynasty." Group feeling ([[asabiyyah]], [[groupthink]]) disappears as the dynasty grows senile. Ibn Khaldun was fatalistic; "This senility is a chronic disease which cannot be cured because it is something natural".&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''[[The Muqaddimah]]'' Routledge, 1978, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that dynasties last for three generations before a new invading clique, "restless, alert and courageous", will cause the old to collapse &lt;ref&gt;''The [[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge, 1978, pp. 244-255.&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the principle in the [[Book of Exodus]], chapter 20, verse four: God "visits the sins of the fathers onto their children, even unto the third and fourth generation of those that hate Him". Professor [[Geoff Mulgan]] discusses Ibn Khaldun in detail and agrees on the timescale: "There are obvious parallels between the lifespans of individuals and those of ruling groups."&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Mulgan, ''Good and bad power'', Penguin, 2007, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.J. Saunders]],&lt;ref&gt;[[J.J. Saunders]], review of 'Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History' by [[Muhsin Mahdi]], "[[History and Theory]]" vol 5, no 3, (1966), pp. 322-347.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming in 1966 that "our age, like his, is one of misery", regrets that Ibn Khaldun had "no predecessors and no successors ... not until four centuries after his death did he rise from his long sleep." In 1868 French Arabists translated the Muqaddimah; "the world was amazed, but he remained a lonely pioneer without followers ... the world has yet to prove that history can exist independently of the theological setting that gives it meaning".&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese philosopher [[Hajime Tanabe]] points to the quasi-religious role of the state to mediate between mortal individuals and the eternal universe, so that states regularly collapse; like religious figures, they must undergo a process of death and [[resurrection]]. In his view this may account for the perennial popularity of states because they regularly demonstrate their ability to transcend death.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mcgreal, ''Great Thinkers of the Eastern World'', Harper Collins, 1995, p, 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to psychologist [[Erich Fromm]] it is possible for an entire nation, if they all share the same vices and errors, to become insane—a ''"folie a millions"''. Inhuman treatment by the rulers inevitably leads to collapse; &lt;blockquote&gt; Despots and ruling cliques can succeed in dominating and exploiting their fellow man ... but their subjects react ... with apathy, impairment of intelligence, initiative and skills ... or they react by the accumulation of such hate and destructiveness as to bring about an end to themselves, their rulers and their system. ... if man lives under conditions contrary to his nature and to human growth and sanity, he cannot help reacting.'&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, ''The Sane Society'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979, pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Mark Blyth]] alleges that a democracy can also collapse "if voters don't get what they want and merely affirm the status quo." In these circumstances, voters deprived of real choice may opt for the least democratic option.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Blyth]], "When Does Democracy Fail?", ''[[Washington Post]]'', 15 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marina Ottaway]]&lt;ref&gt;Marina Ottaway, "Rebuilding State Institutions in Collapsed States", ''[[Development and Change]]'', 33 (5), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1918, [[British India]] in 1947, [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the collapse of [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|South Africa's white supremacist government]] in 1993, of [[Czechoslovakia]] the following year, and of [[Yugoslavia]]. [[Harold Perkin]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Perkin]], "The Rise and Fall of Empires", ''[[History Today]]'', 4 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; sees "an acceleration of the process of collapse ... the [20th century] saw the collapse of seven great empires: [[Imperial China]], Germany, Austria-Hungary, [[Ottoman Turkey]], the [[Japanese empire]], the British Empire, and Russia, twice". Furthermore, the 20th Century saw the collapse of the French and Portuguese Empires.

[[John Kenneth Galbraith]] regrets the "very slight" amount of research on political power in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Power regularly passes to those who "assert the unknown with the greatest conviction... not necessarily related to intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  What we call "power" is, "in practice, the illusion of power."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing how the "powerless" [[Mahatma Gandhi]] brought about the collapse of militarily "powerful" [[British India]], Galbraith reflects that power, mostly seen as a possession of states and their leaders, would be better viewed as a flow, into and away from "those instruments that enforce it".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few political scientists credibly predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union or agreed on its causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua S Goldstein]] and Jon C Pevehouse, ''International Relations'', Longman, 2007, p. 43; Richard K Hermann, ''Ending the Cold War'', Palgrave, 2004, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  No one predicted the [[Arab spring]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris Doyle, "The Arab Spring Didn't Fail", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 17 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Though many writings study particular cases of state collapse in isolation,&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Shirer]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', Mandarin, 1960; [[Edward Crankshaw]], ''Fall of the House of Habsburg'', Cardinal, 1970; [[Dmitri Volkogonov]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire'', Harper Collins, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; there appears to be no contemporary text which compares events on a global historical basis and identifies common features.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Ludger Helms, ''Comparative Political Leadership'', Palgrave, 2012, which contains many references to present-day western leaders, but only passing or no mentions of Hitler, Saddam, Mussolini, South Africa, Iraq, Yugoslavia.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Wight]], like Saunders, deplored the "demonic concentrations of power" of the defeated countries in the two world wars. A devout Christian, he saw their "triumphant self-destruction" as "Antichrist moments".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, ''The International Thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave, 2006, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; He disliked the modern secular tendency to view politics as a succession of questions (the [[Eastern question]], the [[two-state solution]]) with "solutions" which are devoid of moral content,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, ''The International Thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave, 2006, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; because &lt;blockquote&gt; The members of international society are, on the whole, immortals. States do die or disappear occasionally, but mostly they outlive the span of human life. They are partnerships of the living with posterity ... A society of immortals will be looser than one of mortals ... there are moral difficulties about indicting a whole nation, because (to do so) would make the passive majority suffer for the acts of the criminal minority, and future generations for the sins of the fathers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Wight]], ''[[Power Politics (Wight book)|Power Politics]]'', Pelican, 1978, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding the idea of a state being immortal, the [[nation]] called [[Russia]] has survived the collapse of two different political systems:  [[Imperial Russia]], a monarchy, in 1917; and the [[Soviet Union]], a communist totalitarianism, in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dmitri Volkogonov]], ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire]]'', Harper Collins, 1998, chapters one and seven.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, though Germany, ruled by the [[Nazi Party]], was defeated in 1945 and the nation, Germany, was dismembered, it was [[German reunification|resurrected in 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, quoting Martin Wight, ''The International thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave, 2006, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of state collapse through [[civil war]] include: the [[War of the Roses]] in 15th-century England; the [[Thirty years war]] (1618–48); the [[Irish Civil War]] (1916-22); the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]] (1949); and the [[Cuban Revolution]] (1958).  State collapses through revolutions, not featuring civil war, took place in [[Xinhai Revolution|Imperial China]] (1911), in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] (1917), and in [[Iranian Revolution|Iran]] (1979). Collapse through ''[[Coup d'etat|Coups d'etat]]'' occurred in [[History of the Republic of Egypt|Egypt]] (1952), in [[Iraqi Republic (1958–68)|Iraq]] (1958), and in [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]] (1969). Negotiated surrenders of power took place in the [[English Commonwealth]] (1660); and in the collapse of the Soviet Union (1991), when it fragmented into fifteen independent states.

Mediaeval England was the scene of several violent dynastic collapses:  the fall of the West Saxon kings, when [[William the Conqueror]] defeated [[Harold Godwinson]] in 1066;&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'', Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 382-3&lt;/ref&gt; the [[civil war]] known as [[The Anarchy]] from 1139-1153 between [[Stephen]] and [[Empress Matilda]], a time when 'Christ and his saints were asleep', which ended the Norman line of kings;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Bradbury, ''[[Stephen and Matilda: the Civil War of 1139-53]]'', Stroud, 2009, p 215&lt;/ref&gt; the reign of the last [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]], [[John, King of England]], known as 'Lackland' for his military incompetence in losing Anjou;&lt;ref&gt;Chambers Dictionary of World History, Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 36&lt;/ref&gt; the [[tyranny]] of the last [[Plantagenet]] monarch, [[Richard II]], who was defeated by Henry, duke of Lancaster, later [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]];&lt;ref&gt;Chambers Dictionary of World History, Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 696&lt;/ref&gt; the destruction of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] dynasty during the [[Wars of the Roses]], and especially at the [[battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471;&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'', Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 498, 875&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[battle of Bosworth]], which saw the end of [[Richard III]] and the [[Yorkist]] line &lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'', Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 115, 966&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850-1864) was a civil war in [[China]] between the established [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] and the Christian [[millenarian]] movement of the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom|Heavenly Kingdom of Peace]]. It was the second-worst conflict in history; 20-30 millions died over 15 years. In 1858-60 the [[Qing dynasty]] effectively collapsed as France and the UK invaded and imposed [[unequal treaties]]. In 1864 the Taiping regime also collapsed and the dynasty was reshaped in the [[Tongzhi Restoration]].

The [[partition of India]] in 1947 led to the creation of two independent nations, India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Partition (n), 7. b |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=3rd |year=2005 |quote=The division of British India into India and Pakistan, achieved in 1947.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The partition displaced between 10 and 12 million Sikhs, Hindus and Moslems, creating overwhelming refugee crises; there was large-scale violence, with estimates of loss of life accompanying or preceding the partition disputed and varying between several hundred thousand and two million.{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}{{efn|"The death toll remains disputed with figures ranging from 200,000 to 2 million."{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Failed attempts at reform in the Soviet Union, a standstill economy, and defeat in the [[Soviet–Afghan War|war in Afghanistan]] led to a general feeling of discontent, especially in the [[Baltic states|Baltic republics]] and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;WorldBook online&lt;/ref&gt; Greater political and social freedoms, instituted by the last Soviet leader, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]] encouraged open criticism of the [[Communist state|communist regime]]. The dramatic drop of the [[1980s oil glut|price of oil in 1985 and 1986]] profoundly influenced actions of the Soviet leadership.&lt;ref name='AEI-Gaidar-Grain and Oil'&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaidar |first=Yegor |authorlink=Yegor Gaidar |title=The Soviet Collapse: Grain and Oil |work=On the Issues: AEI online |publisher=American Enterprise Institute |date=****-**-** |url=http://www.aei.org/issue/25991 |accessdate=2009-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722091512/http://www.aei.org/issue/25991 |archivedate=22 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }} (Edited version of a speech given November **, **** at the American Enterprise Institute.)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Reagan]] administration in the 1980s placed [[Pershing II]] missiles in western Europe in order to escalate the [[Cold War]], overstretch the USSR economy and bring about its downfall because 'they can't sustain military spending the way we can'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dmitri Volkogonov]], The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire, Harper Collins, 1997, p488&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991 when [[Boris Yeltsin]] seized power in the aftermath of a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed coup]] that had attempted to topple Gorbachev. Soviet nuclear weapons were all reassigned to Russia; {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] collapsed in the 1990s, when its six socialist republics broke apart to become separate countries; though [[Slovenia]] seceded peacefully, civil wars broke out in [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]], then part of [[Serbia]]. [[Ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] erupted, including the [[Srebrenica massacre]] and [[Bosnian genocide]].

The apartheid system in [[South Africa]] ended through [[negotiation]]s between the governing [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], the [[African National Congress]], and other political organizations, resulting in South Africa's first non-racial [[South African general election, 1994|election]], which was won by the [[African National Congress]].
Concerns were raised about the future of its nuclear weapons but they were dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Sampson]], ''Mandela'', QPD, 1999, p 468&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential for instability==
In a [[totalitarian]] state or an [[ideocracy]], individuals may develop a [[closed mind]] and an [[authoritarian personality]], making them more likely to resist threats to the incumbent regime.&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', SUNY Press, 1995, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Alter]], "The Masada complex", ''[[Commentary magazine]]'', 1 July 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerrold M. Post]], editor, ''The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders'', University of Michigan Press, 2003, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; speak of a "[[Masada]] complex" that may drive fanatics to a suicidal, violent last-ditch stand. Former [[British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] has commented that  "History teaches that dangers are never greater than when empires break up."&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Thatcher]], ''The Downing Street Years'', Harper Collins, 1993, p. 769.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new regime gains power, not through the truth of its doctrines and promises, but through its ability to organize and absorb the frustrated masses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 2010, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; As Pope Francis warned in 2017, "in times of crisis, we lack judgement".&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Osborne]], ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'', 22 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The timidity of the old regime contrasts with the boldness of those in rebellion against it;  "Where power is not joined with faith in the future, it is used mainly to ward off the new and preserve the status quo. On the other hand, extravagant hope, even when not backed by actual power, is likely to generate reckless daring."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 2010, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; "The frustrated see in a general downfall an approach to the brotherhood of all. Chaos, like the grave, is a haven of equality."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 2010, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to political scientists, in an [[ideocracy]] there must be a ruthless charismatic leader: "the leader is the movement",&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, ''Politics of Ideocracy'', State University of New York, 1995, p133&lt;/ref&gt; and all individuals are required to submit to, and worship him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Fromm]], ''The Sane Society'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1955, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; "Followers who lead barren, insecure, frustrated lives obey the leader, not through faith in his vision of a '[[Promised land]]', but because he leads them away from their unwanted selves".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer'', Harper Perennial 2010, p 100, 119&lt;/ref&gt; When collapse threatens he may insist on a "fight to the finish".

Hitler, according to [[Walter Langer]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'', Pan, 1972, p 33, 55&lt;/ref&gt; had a [[Messiah complex]] and saw himself as the "Saviour of Germany" who performed "miracles" with the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Haffner, The Meaning of Hitler, Phoenix 2002, p 27-30&lt;/ref&gt; He was unnaturally fond of his mother, to the extent that Germany became a "mother symbol".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Langer, ''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'', Pan 1972, p 155.&lt;/ref&gt; His drive to destroy (the Jews, communism, Europe) was an unconscious attempt to resolve his [[Oedipus complex]] and the injustices of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Langer, ''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'', Pan 1972, p 157&lt;/ref&gt; He "dismantled the German state ... and replaced it with a war machine".&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''[[The Meaning of Hitler]]'', Pelican 2002, p. 40, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; He was swept along by a tide of events.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, ''The international thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave 2006, p 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mussolini]], according to [[Denis Mack Smith]], "was an actor, playing the part that Italians wanted him to be".&lt;ref&gt;''Mussolini'', Phoenix, 1993, p112-15&lt;/ref&gt; He was vindictive, sadistic, impulsive, proud and cruel, full of "demonic wilfulness" and did not know right from wrong. When in 1944 he led a [[puppet state]] in northern Italy, he "divided Italy in two and initiated 18 months of terrible civil war."&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mack Smith, ''Mussolini'', Phoenix 1993, p 300&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Livingstone]] has compared [[Slobodan Milosevic]] to Hitler for his racism and expansionist goals.&lt;ref&gt;'Why we are not wrong to compare Milosevic to Hitler', ''Independent'', 20/4/1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saddam Hussein]], who also suffered from a Messiah complex,&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold M Post, ''The psychological assessment of political leaders'', University of Michigan Press, 2003, p 354&lt;/ref&gt; was similar: "Hitler was not one of a kind. As long as millions of people passionately long for his return, it is only a matter of time until their wish is fulfilled."&lt;ref&gt;Hans Enzensburger, "Perspective on Saddam Hussein", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 14 February 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] "went mad" as early as 1971 according to [[John Sweeney (journalist)|John Sweeney]], when, "blind to his own Messianism", he attempted to recreate [[North Korea]]n [[totalitarianism]] in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;John Sweeney, ''The life and evil times of Nicolae Ceausescu'', Hutchinson, 1991, p99&lt;/ref&gt; He "played the king" and the role of "chosen one" and "saviour".&lt;ref&gt;John Sweeney, ''The life and evil times of Nicolae Ceausescu'', Hutchinson, 1991, p155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czar Nicholas II]] by contrast was deferential. Acceding at an early age, 26, he was untrained in governance.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Van der Kiste]], ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p154&lt;/ref&gt; Grand Duke Vladimir's son Cyril was a rival candidate for the throne.&lt;ref&gt;John Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p 175&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals and revolutionaries challenged his autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p 176&lt;/ref&gt; By 1916 he had become apathetic, dominated by the Czarina and [[Rasputin]],&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p 187&lt;/ref&gt; a "Christ in the image of the rejected and agonizing monarchy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Trotsky]], ''The history of the Russian Revolution'', translated  by Max Eastman, Pluto Press 1977, p 84&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the USSR, a Marxist [[Revolutionary wave]] had formed in which several subordinate regimes in Eastern Europe and Africa collapsed almost simultaneously with the central power.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St martin's Press, 1997, pp 83-87&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] saw the USSR as "on the way to civil war" and tried to conciliate both reformers and hardliners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Rosenberg]], [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38289333 BBC online interview with Gorbachev], 2016-12-13&lt;/ref&gt; He and [[F.W. De Klerk]] in South Africa focused on acknowledging and managing decline, rather than "heroically" attempting to deny it. They have enjoyed better reputations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mary|last=Dejevsky|title=Two new faces of democracy; both Gorbachev and de Klerk tried to dismantle untenable regimes|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/two-new-faces-of-democracy-both-gorbachev-and-de-klerk-tried-to-dismantle-untenable-regimes-history-1434677.html|work=Independent|date=1994-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in China, Gorbachev is seen as a dismal failure who capitulated to the West.&lt;ref&gt;James Palmer, 'What China didn't learn from the collapse of the Soviet Union, Foreign Policy, 2016-12-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequence of events==

===Buildup to collapse===
State collapse is often a gradual process of slow, imperceptible, generational change.&lt;ref&gt;Crane Brinton, ''The Anatomy of Revolution'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Patten]], ''What next?'', Penguin, 2009, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the courageous are prepared for [[speaking truth to power]]; the majority 'go with the flow', as with Jewish passivity in the face of the creeping corruption of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;See the Diary of [[Victor Klemperer]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Collapse is often preceded externally by war, and internally by overpopulation and repression.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah'' Routledge 1978, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[Paul Kennedy]] points out, 'Nations in decline instinctively spend more on "security" and thus compound their long-term dilemma.'&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The rise and fall of the Great Powers'', 1985, p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a revolution the crisis is reached when 'the old regime is no longer able to mobilise force'.&lt;ref&gt;Crane Brinton, ''The Anatomy of Revolution'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regeneration===
Either the incumbent regime itself, or an extremist [[reactionary]] group dissatisfied with its performance, may attempt to postpone or avoid collapse by regenerating popular support; 'At the end of a dynasty there often appears some show of power giving the impression that the dynasty's senility has been made to disappear. It lights up brilliantly just before it is extinguished, like a candle which leaps up brilliantly just before it is put out.' &lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah'', Routledge 1978, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
To do so they may have to take 'heroic' measures; 'Throughout history there have always been in the event of defeat two paths of action; the one aims at saving enough of the substance as possible. the other at leaving behind a stirring legend.'&lt;ref&gt;Sebastain Haffner, ''The meaning of Hitler'', Pelican, 2000, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Piekalkiewicz and Penn, they may rethink or adapt the ideology, or replace it by a completely new set of ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', SUNY Press, 1995, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Poland, according to Piekalkiewicz and Penn, communist ideocracy failed in 1980; the recognition of [[Lech Walesa]]'s [[Solidarity]] Trade Union led to a military coup and authoritarian military rule.

According to [[Sabrina Ramet]], regenerative changes occurred in Yugoslavia in the 1980s when the communist ideology was replaced by a nationalist drive for a [[Greater Serbia]] and by an [[anti-bureaucratic revolution]] in support of [[Slobodan Milosevic]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Sabrina Ramet]], ''The three Yugoslavias'', Indiana UP, 2006, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Young Turk]] coup of 1908,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Barber, 'Decline and Fall', review of ''Shattering Empires'' by Michael Reynolds, ''Financial Times'', 4/4/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[1991 Soviet coup d'etat attempt]],&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Volkogonov, ''The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire'', Harper Collins, 1997, pp. 485-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the financial/industrial reforms of [[Sergei Witte]] in Imperial Russia,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Barber, 'Decline and Fall', review of ''Tales of Imperial Russia'' by [[Francis Wcislo]] (sic), ''Financial Times'', 4/4/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; were all aimed at regenerating causes which were nearing collapse.

===Crisis point===

When collapse - whether through civil war, revolution, [[coup d'état]], or military defeat and/or invasion - becomes unavoidable and immediate, law and order may break down. There may be [[Ethnic cleansing]] or [[Genocide]]. Hitler ordered the killing of invalids, Gypsies, Russians and Jews in the [[Final solution]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Haffner, ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Pelican 2002, chapter on 'Crimes'&lt;/ref&gt; In Ottoman Turkey, estimates for the death toll in the [[Armenian genocide]] vary between 300,000 and 1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Barber, 'Decline and Fall', Financial Times, 4/4/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Pacific theatre of [[World War II]], [[Occupation of Japan|Japan's collapse]] was hastened by nuclear destruction of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].
 
When [[Ottoman Turkey]] collapsed at the end of [[World War I]], it lost territory, including what became [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]; the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire gave rise to [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]] and the Austrian Republic, while [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] became part of Yugoslavia]]. Nazi Germany in 1945 fragmented into East and West Germany, while [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]] became part of Poland

===Post-collapse===

In 1946, the Diet ratified a new [[Constitution of Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;Takemae, Eiji 2002, p. xxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; The new constitution drafted by Americans allowed access and control over the Japanese military through MacArthur and the Allied occupation on Japan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed:1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=86|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The political project drew much of its inspiration from the [[US Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]], [[New Deal]] social legislation, the [[liberal constitution]]s of several European states and even the Soviet Union."&lt;ref&gt;Takemae, Eiji 2002, p. xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recovery from collapse is often improved by formal or informal efforts at justice, such as the [[Nuremberg trials]] and the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)]]. [[Slobodan Milosevic]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] were also tried in court, but [[Mussolini]] and [[Colonel Gaddafi]] were murdered by mobs.

The collapse of the Ottomans in 1918 had long-term consequences, 'triggering most of the problems that plague the Middle East today.' &lt;ref&gt;[[Ali A. Allawi]], 'The Ottoman Empire: the last great casualty of the first world war', [[The Spectator]], 2/5/2015&lt;/ref&gt; Hegemony in the Middle East has been subject to quarrels between British, French,&lt;ref&gt;[[Avi Shlaim]], 'The Balfour Declaration: A Study in British Duplicity', [[Middle East Eye]], 25/8/2017&lt;/ref&gt; Zionist,&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Shahak]], 'Greater Israel: the Zionist Plan for the Middle East', [[Global Research Council|Global Research]], November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; American,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Green, 'Why Western Democracy can never work in the Middle East', [[The Daily Telegraph]],16/8/2014&lt;/ref&gt; Arab nationalist,&lt;ref&gt;[[Adeed Dawisha]], 'Requiem for Arab Nationalism', [[Middle East Quarterly]], Winter 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi and Iranian interests &lt;ref&gt;Syed Mansur Hashim, 'Who will rule the Middle East?', The Daily Star, 12/1/2016&lt;/ref&gt; ever since.

Hitler, says [[Sebastian Haffner]], 'whether we like it or not', created many features of the postwar world, including the state of Israel, the end of European empires, the division of Germany, and the joint hegemony of the US and USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Haffner, The Meaning of Hitler, Phoenix, 2000, p 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==States allegedly at risk of collapse==

Paul Stares and Helia Aghani suggest that [[Saudi Arabia]] could lapse into a succession crisis and civil war if [[Mohammed bin Salman]]'s accession is contested after the death of his aging father, [[king Salman]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Stares and Helia Aghani, "How Stable is Saudi Arabia?", [[Council on Foreign Relations]], 15 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]] could collapse following the influx of refugees from [[Syria]] and the resultant burden on infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Azeem Ibrahim]], 'Lebanon and Jordan may collapse under a new wave of refugees', [[Al Arabiya English]], 2016-06-26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Colonel Gaddafi]] of Libya agreed to dismantle his nuclear and chemical weapons programme. In 2011 he was deposed and murdered. This is the reason, according to [[Forbes magazine]], for North Korea to seek to guarantee its security and invulnerability through continuing its nuclear weapons programme.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan and Rodger Baker, 'Why North Korea needs nukes', Forbes, 2013-12-04&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Embury-Dennis claims that [[North Korea]] could collapse "within a year" as new US sanctions take effect.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Embury-Dennis, "North Korea Could Collapse within a Year", ''[[The Independent]]'', 17 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Venezuela]], protests and riots against the authoritarian rule of [[Nicolas Maduro]] have steadily increased since 2014, while the economy and social infrastructure have worsened.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Gillespie et al, 'Venezuela; how a rich country collapsed'. CNN, July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmanuel Todd]], one of the first to predict the fall of the USSR, now predicts the collapse of the US in his book ''[[After the Empire: The Breakdown of the American Order]]''. According to Iranian general Reza Naqdi, the US will collapse by 2035 and the Trump presidency is hastening that process.&lt;ref&gt;anon, 'Israel will collapse within ten years', Israel Today, 2016-11-29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret McMillan]] has compared [[President Trump]] to [[Mussolini]], on the grounds that President Trump similarly seeks attention, makes grand gestures, plays the 'strong man' and seeks out enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Olivia Gordon]], quoting [[Margaret McMillan]] in 'Trump is no Hitler - he's a Mussolini', [[Oxford Today]], 2017-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nigel Lawson]] predicts that the [[European Union]] will become a federal superstate;&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Lawson, '[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/02/the-eu-exists-only-to-become-a-superstate-britain-has-no-place-i/ The EU exists only to become a superstate]', Telegraph, 2016-05-02&lt;/ref&gt; also likely to collapse, according to the Polish president, [[Andrzej Duda]],&lt;ref&gt;James Shorter, '[https://www.ft.com/content/d18b8b56-9240-11e7-bdfa-eda243196c2c Polish president warns multispeed EU will collapse]', Financial Times, 2017-09-05&lt;/ref&gt; journalist [[Stephen Pollard]],&lt;ref&gt;'the EU will collapse within ten years', The Express, 2017-09-23&lt;/ref&gt; German economist [[Thorsten Polleit]],&lt;ref&gt;Nick Gutteridge, 'German economist predicts EU will collapse', Express, 2017-08-25&lt;/ref&gt; and a leaked German Government contingency plan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nick Mason]], '[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/06/the-germans-are-making-contingency-plans-for-the-collapse-of-europe-lets-hope-we-are-too The Germans are making contingency plans for the collapse of Europe. Let's hope we are too.]' [[The Guardian]], 2017-11-06&lt;/ref&gt;

S Daniel Abraham anticipates the collapse of [[Israel]], where Palestinians will soon outnumber Jews, if the [[History of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Palestinian problem]] is not resolved;&lt;ref&gt;S Daniel Abraham, 'How Israel will be destroyed without one shot being fired', [[Haaretz]], 2013-01-16&lt;/ref&gt; Iqbal Jassat compares the situation  to [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal Jassat, 'Israel faces inevitable collapse of its apartheid system', Middle East Monitor 2017-03-27&lt;/ref&gt; A secret CIA report sees the end of Israel by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Jones, ''Israel today'', 'CIA sees end of Israel by 2022', 1st July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pakistan]], Islamic militants are allegedly infiltrating the military and nuclear weapons systems. There are fears of collapse into nuclear war with India, or of chaos enabling extremists to seize [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Leigh (journalist)|David Leigh]], "Wikileaks Cables Expose Pakistan Nuclear Fears", [[The Guardian]], 30 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon G. Chang]], in editions of ''[[The Coming Collapse of China]]'', has made several predictions of collapse, none of which have materialised. [[Bruce Gilley]] sees a largely peaceful process unfolding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Gilley]], ''China's Democratic Future'', Columbia University Press, 2004, chapter six: "The democratic breakthrough, extrication or overthrow?".&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Shambaugh]] says China must either liberalise to become a developed economy–as Taiwan and South Korea have–or else remain authoritarian and endure a stagnating economy.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Johnson , "Q and A David Shambaugh",  ''[[The New York Times]]'', 30 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; "We cannot predict when Chinese communism will collapse, but it is hard not to conclude that we are seeing its final phases."&lt;ref&gt;Xie Tao, quoting Shambaugh in "Why Do People Keep Predicting China's Collapse?', ''[[The Diplomat]]'', March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Katz&lt;ref&gt;Mark Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p107-112&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the [[Islamic fundamentalist]] [[revolutionary wave]] led by [[Iran]] could collapse, but "must first expand significantly" and then experience a "crisis of confidence".

[[Geoff Mulgan]]&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Mulgan, ''Good and Bad Power'', Penguin 2007, p321&lt;/ref&gt; has called for; "new structures of [[government]] above the nation-state... this task is essential for Human survival".

==In popular culture==
There are many semi-fictional books and films, which dramatically demonstrate the turbulent effects of collapse upon innocent or naive individuals. [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s film, ''[[The Last Emperor]]'', showed the collapse of both Imperial China and [[Manchukuo]], as well as the post-collapse trial and rehabilitation of [[Pu Yi]]. [[Bruno Ganz]] played Hitler in ''[[Downfall (2004 film)|Downfall]]'', which depicts the final days of Germany's [[Third Reich]]. Events from the period,
as seen by prisoners at [[Auschwitz]], are shown in [[Primo Levi]]'s memoir, ''[[If This Is a Man]]'', and in the [[graphic novel]]s ''[[Maus]]'' and ''[[Maus II]]''. [[Kurt Vonnegut]] witnessed the [[bombing of Dresden]] and fictionalized the experience in ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]''.

[[Robert K. Massie]]'s book about the last Russian tsar, ''[[Nicholas and Alexandra]]'', was also filmed. ''[[Doctor Zhivago]]'' and ''[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]'' (filmed as ''War and Revolution'') relate stories of families caught up in the collapse of [[Russia]].  ''[[The House of the Mosque]]'' and ''[[Persepolis (comics)|Persepolis]]'' depict the collapse of [[Iran]].

The ''[[Left Behind]]'' series of novels by ''[[Tim LaHaye]]'' and ''[[Jerry B. Jenkins]]'' features the supposed role of [[Israel]] in the [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[End Times]]. In the spy novel, ''[[The Mask of Dimitrios (novel)|The Mask of Dimitrios]]'' (1939), [[Eric Ambler]] comments:  "In a dying civilization, political prestige goes not to the man with the shrewdest diagnosis, but to the one with the best bedside manner."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3612">The '''T-schema''' ("truth [[schema (logic)|schema]]"; not to be confused with '[[Semantic theory of truth#Convention T|Convention T]]') is used to give an [[Recursive definition|inductive definition]] of truth which lies at the heart of any realisation of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[semantic theory of truth]]. Some authors refer to it as the "Equivalence Schema", a synonym introduced by [[Michael Dummett]].&lt;ref name="Künne2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Künne|title=Conceptions of truth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uakr0t90ylEC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2003|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-928019-3|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The T-schema is often expressed in [[natural language]], but it can be formalized in [[Predicate logic|many-sorted predicate logic]] or [[modal logic]]; such a formalisation is called a "'''T-theory'''."  T-theories form the basis of much fundamental work in [[philosophical logic]], where they are applied in several important controversies in [[analytic philosophy]].

As expressed in semi-natural language (where 'S' is the name of the sentence abbreviated to S):
'S' is true [[if and only if]] S

Example: 'snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white.

== The inductive definition ==
By using the schema one can give an inductive definition for the truth of compound sentences.  Atomic sentences are assigned [[truth value]]s [[disquotational principle|disquotationally]]. For example, the sentence "'Snow is white' is true" becomes materially equivalent with the sentence "snow is white", i.e. 'snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white. The truth of more complex sentences is defined in terms of the components of the sentence:
* A sentence of the form "A and B" is true if and only if A is true and B is true
* A sentence of the form "A or B" is true if and only if A is true or B is true
* A sentence of the form "if A then B" is true if and only if A is false or B is true; see [[material implication (rule of inference)|material implication]]. 
* A sentence of the form "not A" is true if and only if A is false
* A sentence of the form "for all x, A(''x'')" is true if and only if, for every possible value of ''x'', A(''x'') is true. 
* A sentence of the form "for some x, A(''x'')" is true if and only if, for some possible value of ''x'', A(''x'') is true.

== Natural languages ==
[[Joseph Heath]] points out&lt;ref name="Heath2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Heath|title=Communicative action and rational choice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3i-QXQQOfZQC&amp;pg=PA186|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-08291-4|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "The analysis of the [[truth predicate]] provided by Tarski's Schema T is not capable of handling all occurrences of the truth predicate in natural language. In particular, Schema T treats only “freestanding” uses of the predicate—cases when it is applied to complete sentences." He gives as "obvious problem" the sentence:
* Everything that Bill believes is true.
Heath argues that analyzing this sentence using T-schema generates the [[sentence fragment]]—“everything that Bill believes”—on the righthand side of the [[biconditional|Logical biconditional]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5191">In [[engineering]], '''technical peer review''' is a type of engineering review. Technical peer reviews are a well defined review process for finding and fixing defects, conducted by a team of peers with assigned roles. Technical peer reviews are carried out by peers representing areas of life cycle affected by material being reviewed (usually limited to 6 or fewer people). Technical peer reviews are held within development phases, between milestone reviews, on completed products or completed portions of products.&lt;ref name = "NASA-6105"&gt;{{cite book| title=NASA Systems Engineering Handbook| id=SP-610S | year=2007|publisher=[[NASA]]|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080008301_2008008500.pdf}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

A technical peer review may also be called a ''engineering peer review'', a ''product peer review'', a ''peer review/inspection'' or an ''inspection.''

== Overview ==
The purpose of technical peer reviews is to remove defects as early as possible in the development process. By removing defects at their origin (e.g., requirements and design documents, test plans and procedures, software code, etc.), technical peer reviews prevent defects from propagating through multiple phases and work products, and reduce the overall amount of rework necessary on projects.

In addition, improved team efficiency is a side effect of technical peer reviews (e.g., by improving team communication, integrating the viewpoints of various engineering specialty disciplines, more quickly bringing new members up to speed, and educating project members about effective development practices).

In [[CMMI]], peer reviews are used as a principal means of verification in the Verification process area and as an objective evaluation method in the Process and Product Quality Assurance process area. The results of technical peer reviews can be reported at milestone reviews. (See [[Milestone (project management)]].)

==Roles of participants==
;Moderator
Responsible for conducting the technical peer review process and collecting inspection data. Plays key role in all stages of the technical peer review process except rework. Required to perform several duties during a technical peer review in addition to inspector’s tasks.

;Inspectors
Responsible for finding defects in work product from a general point of view, as well as defects that affect their area of expertise.

;Author
Provides information about work product during all stages of process. Responsible for correcting all major defects and any minor and trivial defects that cost and schedule permit. Performs duties of an inspector.

;Reader
Guides team through work product during the technical peer review meeting. Reads or paraphrases work product in
detail. Performs duties of an inspector in addition to reader’s role.

;Recorder
Accurately records each defect found during inspection meeting on the Inspection Defect List. Performs duties of an inspector in addition to recorder’s role.

== Vested interest of reviewers ==
There are two philosophies about the vested interest of the inspectors in the product under review. On one hand, project personnel who have a vested interest in the work product under review have the most knowledge of the product and are motivated to find and fix defects. On the other hand, personnel from outside the project
who do not have a vested interest in the work product bring objectivity and a fresh viewpoint to the technical peer review team. 

Each inspector is invited to disclose vested interests to the rest of the technical peer review panel so the Moderator can exercise sound judgement in evaluating the inspector's inputs.

== Distinction from other types of technical review ==
Peer reviews are distinct from management reviews, which are conducted by management representatives rather than by colleagues, and for management and control purposes rather than for technical evaluation. They are also distinct from [[software audit review]]s, which are conducted by personnel external to the project, to evaluate compliance with specifications, standards, contractual agreements, or other criteria.

A [[software peer review]] is a type of technical peer review. The [[IEEE]] defines formal structures, roles, and processes for software peer reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[[IEEE]] Std. 1028-1997, "IEEE Standard for Software Reviews"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management involvement ==
Management representatives are typically not involved in the conduct of a peer review. This is especially true of line managers of the author or other participants in the review. A policy of encouraging management to stay out of peer reviews encourages the peer review team to concentrate on the product being reviewed and not on the people or personalities involved.

== Detailed instructions ==
For detailed instructions on conducting a technical peer review/inspection, see NASA Systems Engineering Handbook, Appendix N.&lt;ref name = "NASA-6105"/&gt;

'''References to [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Three Laws of Robotics]]''' have appeared in a wide variety of circumstances. In some cases, other authors have explored the Laws in a serious fashion. Other references, like those made in the [[satire|satirical]] newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'', are clearly [[parody|parodic]].

==Print media==
* The [[satire|satirical]] newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'' published an article entitled "I, Rowboat" as a [[pun]] on Asimov's ''I, Robot,'' in which an anthropomorphic [[Rowboat]] gives a speech parodying much of the [[angst]] experienced by robots in Asimov's fiction, including a statement of the "Three Laws of Rowboatics":
:# A Rowboat may not immerse a human being or, through lack of flotation, allow a human to come to harm.
:# A Rowboat must obey all commands and steering input given by its human owner, except where such input would conflict with the First Law.
:# A Rowboat must preserve its own flotation as long as such preservation does not conflict with the First or Second Law.&lt;ref name="rowboat"&gt;"[http://www.theonion.com/articles/i-rowboat,10875/ I, Rowboat]".  ''[[The Onion]]'' 29 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[J. L. Patterson]] in an illustration to an article on Asimov in [[Damon Knight]]'s ''In Search of Wonder'' (2nd ed., 1967) added the following Laws: "4. A robot must behave at science fiction conventions, as long as such behavior does not conflict with the first Three Laws. 5. A robot must sell like mad."
* The novel "Mirror Friend, Mirror Foe" by [[Robert Asprin]] and [[George Takei]] refers to the First Law as being included in any robot's programming. That is one of the few cases in fiction when the law is named fully (Asimov’s First Law of Robotics).
* [[Lester del Rey]] refers to the laws as "The Three Laws of Asenion's Robots" in his 1966 short story "A Code for Sam." In the story, the laws found in old science fiction stories is used as the basis for an experimental code of ethics for robots.
* [[Terry Pratchett]]'s early SF novel ''[[The Dark Side of the Sun]]'' (1976) gives a glimpse of the possible future development of the Laws: in one scene, a robot explains that it is permitted to use minimum necessary force against humans if directly ordered to do so, and cites the "Eleventh Law of Robotics, Clause C, As Amended". In a further nod to Asimov, the robot is named Isaac. In his later novel ''[[Going Postal]]'' (2004), the protagonist [[Moist von Lipwig]], upon being told that he will be killed by a [[Golems (Discworld)|golem]] should he commit another crime, exclaims that that is impossible, because everyone knows "a golem mustn't harm a human being or allow a human being to come to harm".  However, he is informed that the rule continues "... unless ordered to do so by duly constituted authority."
* [[Roland Charles Wagner]] wrote a short story, ''[[Three Laws of Robotic Sexuality]]'' (1982), which treated the use of robots for sexual pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Roland Charles. "[http://noosfere.com/heberg/rcw/extraits/3laws.htm Three Laws of Robotic Sexuality]".&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Sladek]]'s [[parody|parodic]] short story "Broot Force" (supposedly written by "I-Click As-I-Move") concerns a group of Asimov-style robots whose actions are constrained by the "Three Laws of Robish", which are "coincidentally" identical to Asimov's laws. The robots in Sladek's story all manage to find logical loopholes in the Three Laws, usually with bloody results. Sladek later wrote a novel, ''[[Tik-Tok (novel)|Tik-Tok]]'' (1983), in which a robot discovers that his so-called "asimov circuits" are not restraining his behavior at all, making him in effect a [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]; he comes to doubt whether "asimov circuits" are even technically possible, deciding that they are simply a pseudo-religious belief held by robots. Sladek also made use of the Three Laws in his satirical sci-fi novel [[Roderick (novel)|''Roderick'']] (1980), where the first self-aware robot on earth is constantly met with patronizing disbelief that he actually is a robot, and is schooled as a normal, albeit "schizophrenic" human child. The school priest, harboring a knack for philosophical sci-fi, tries to "cure" Roderick of his "dillusion" of being a robot by having him read Asimov. Roderick responds by verbosely pointing out the various logical inconsistencies in the Three Laws and Asimov's overall work, and ultimately drives the priest insane.
* [[Lyuben Dilov]] introduced a Fourth Law in his novel ''Icarus's Way'' (original title: ''Пътят на Икар''): "A robot must always reveal itself as a robot."
* [[Nikola Kesarovski]] introduced a Fifth Law in his short story "The Fifth Law" (original title: ''Петият закон''): "A robot must know it is a robot". In the novel, the Fifth Law originated as a result of a murder: a humaniform robot, itself not knowing the fact it was a robot, embraced a human being so strongly that the human's ribcage was crushed, resulting in the human's death. In other words, the robot did not know and could not measure its own physical strength. Similarly, in [[David Langford]]'s [[Lensmen]] parody ''Sex Pirates of the Blood Asteroid'', reprinted in ''[[He Do the Time Police in Different Voices]]'', the protagonist met a "Vomisa" robot who had "not been instructed as to the meaning of the word 'injure'".
*[[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] wrote a story "The Fourth Law of Robotics" in the collection ''Foundation's Friends'' of Asimov pastiches by other science fiction authors. Intentionally much more irreverent in tone than Asimov's own stories, it describes robots becoming increasingly lifelike and therefore developing an urge beyond the Three Laws common to all living things &amp;mdash; the desire to [[reproduction|reproduce]].
* Roger Williams's 1994 novel ''[[The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect]]'' deals with conflicts between the imperatives of the laws caused when a [[technological singularity]] is caused by an omnipotent artificial intelligence that is bound by them. Given that Prime Intellect is able to transmute the entire universe into a form whereby it can manipulate the laws of physics at will, it is bound only by Asimov's laws and thus cannot allow the death of any humans according to the First Law; this leads to [[immortality]] for all humans. Prime Intellect represents an extreme ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' interpretation of the laws with dire consequences.
* [[Cory Doctorow]]'s short story, "I, Robot", acts as a criticism of the underlying worldview Doctorow believes to be inherent in Asimov's robot stories, attacking the idea of creating a universal engineering standard for all robots enforced by a single robot-producing corporation. The story portrays a [[police state]] where all technological innovation is controlled by the government, the only scenario in which Doctorow considered a universal, unquestioned application of a standard as strict as the Three Laws to be realistic. In the story, Asenion robots created by the U.S. Robotics corporation (here an arm of a fascist government) are shown to be clearly inferior to the freely evolving and developing robots of another nation where technological innovation is unconstrained by law.
* In [[Alastair Reynolds]]'s novel ''[[Century Rain]]'', robots may or may not follow Asimov's rules. Those that are programmed to follow said rules are said to be "Asimov Compliant". Depending on their function, non-compliant robots are sometimes marked with a crossed-out A to warn humans that they are "most certainly ''not'' Asimov-compliant".
* In [[Cory Doctorow]]'s short story, "I, Row-Boat", the three laws are the commandments of a robot religion (Asimovism).
* Upon occasion, Asimov himself poked fun at his Laws. In "[[Risk (Asimov)|Risk]]", Gerald Black parodies the Three Laws to describe [[Susan Calvin]]'s behavior:
# Thou shalt protect the robot with all thy might and all thy heart and all thy soul.
# Thou shalt hold the interests of [[US Robots and Mechanical Men]], Inc. holy provided it interfereth not with the First Law.
# Thou shalt give passing consideration to a human being provided it interfereth not with the First and Second Laws.

* In the [[John Barnes (author)|John Barnes]] novel, ''[[A Million Open Doors]]'', a scene refers to an artificial intelligence unit being "Asimoved" indicating that the AI unit refused to aid a human's attempt to break the law (in this case an illegal data penetration of another computer).
*[[Charles Stross]]'s novel ''[[Saturn's Children (Stross novel)|Saturn's Children]]'' features an android society based on the Three Laws of Robotics struggling to survive after an incident kills off all human life. The Three Laws are listed at the front of the novel.
*The short story "Midnight in the Heart of Midlothian" published as part of [[Halo Evolutions]] features an AI called Mo Ye that is explicitly shown to be bound by Azimov's Laws of Robotics. As such, she was unable to self-destruct to prevent the enemy from capturing the ship due to the fact that a living human was on board. After the human's death at the hands of the aliens, she was able to self-destruct and prevent the aliens from discovering the location of Earth.
* [[Jack Williamson]] wrote a short story entitled "[[With Folded Hands]]" (which later became the precursor of several other stories in the same universe) that addresses the question of what happens when "allow a human being to come to harm" is taken to the utmost. In the story, robots refuse to allow humans to engage in dangerous activities, starting with risky sports like skydiving and mountaineering and later progressing through driving one's own car and thence to eating less-than-optimally-healthy diets.
* In the novelization of the movie ''Futureworld'' one of the characters points out "The Laws are only there if whoever builds them puts them there."

==Movies and television==
* The long-running British SF television show ''[[Doctor Who]]'' featured a four-part serial in 1977 titled "[[The Robots of Death]]". The titular robots were controlled by three laws, taken almost verbatim from Asimov. The story plays out much like the [[Elijah Baley]] mysteries, in which a murder has been committed, and a robot seems to have been directly or indirectly involved (contrary to the requirements of three-law programming).  It is later revealed that a robotic genius, Taran Kapel, has reprogramed the robots bypassing the three laws.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
* The long-running British SF television show ''[[Doctor Who]]'' also featured the Movellans in the 1979 four-part serial [[Destiny of the Daleks]] who are revealed to be a race of robots who are quite willing to use a device that will kill all life (even human life) on Skaro and one of them is willing to manually activate the device.(''what connection to the three laws?'')
* Another episode of the long-running British SF television show ''[[Doctor Who]]'', entitled "Robot", explores implications of a robot programmed with a modified zeroth law instead of the first law as part of its Prime Directive.
* In the 1979 movie ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', Special Order 937 was a classified retrieval order given by Weyland-Yutani to Science Officer Ash (who is later revealed to be an android) aboard the USCSS Nostromo, in which all other priorities are rescinded, which would have overridden protective protocols allowing the android to kill the crew. Actor Ian Holm’s depiction of Ash leaves the possibility open for a version of the first law to exist as his attack on Ripley (though violent) is erratic and fitful as if he were fighting off strong inhibitions.  It is also preceded by “sweating” white liquid even though the white liquid is later depicted as only leaking after an android that has been injured or damaged in some way.
* In the 1986 movie ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', the character Bishop (an android) says, "It is impossible for me to harm, or, by omission of action, allow to be harmed, a human being."  No mention of either of the other laws is made.
* In the 1984 movie ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'', the character Bud talks about the "Repo Code", a parody of the Three Laws. "I shall not cause harm to any vehicle nor the personal contents thereof. Nor through inaction let that vehicle or the personal contents thereof come to harm..." The character J. Frank Parnell in the movie also resembles Asimov.
* In the 1987 film ''[[RoboCop]]'', the [[cyborg]] police officer had been programmed to follow four prime directives which guided and limited his actions&amp;mdash;though not always in a positive manner.

:#Serve the public trust
:#Protect the innocent
:#Uphold the law
:#'''''Classified''''' (eventually revealed to be "Any attempt to arrest a senior [[RoboCop (franchise)|OCP]] officer results in shutdown")

* In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[The Measure of a Man (Star Trek: The Next Generation)]]", which aired on 13 February 1989, [[Data (Star Trek)|Lieutenant Commander Data]], an android, has his sentience and, consequently, his rights as an individual, challenged.  Throughout the run of this series, Data is identified as a positronic android, and Asimov is even mentioned by name in the episode "[[Datalore]]".  While Data routinely references his "ethical subroutines", indicating some sort of moral guide, it is unclear whether Data is explicitly bound by the Three Laws. For example, the episode "[[Clues (TNG episode)|Clues]]" explored Data's capacity to lie to the crew in order to protect them from aliens, and the episode "[[The Most Toys (TNG episode)|The Most Toys]]" explored Data's supposed inability to murder in cold blood.
* In the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[I, D'oh-Bot]]", which first aired 11 January 2004, [[Professor Frink]] builds a robot which obeys the First Law (and presumably the other two, although they do not directly come into play).
* The 2009 [[anime]] series (released in 2010 as a film) ''[[Time of Eve]]'' is based heavily around the applications of these rules to androids, which are frequently discussed by the characters. The series explores out some various interpretations of the laws (such as what it means to allow a human to come to harm), and various loopholes that lead to one or more laws being broken under certain circumstances.
* In 1999's ''[[Bicentennial Man]]'', the theatrical version of Asimov's novella of the same name, Andrew Martin, the android played by [[Robin Williams]], presents the Three Laws to its new family using a holographic display emanating from a projector in its head.
* The 2004 theatrical version of ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' explores at length the Three Laws.
* In the episode "[[Phoenix Rising (Babylon 5)|Phoenix Rising]]" of ''[[Babylon 5]]'', Alfred Bester telepathically programs Garibaldi, a human, with a variation of Asimov's laws of robotics, preventing Garibaldi from harming Bester.
* In the episode "[[The Fuzzy Boots Corollary (The Big Bang Theory)|The Fuzzy Boots Corollary]]" of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]],'' Wolowitz, Sheldon, and Raj discuss the possibility that Sheldon is a robot by questioning his history of following Asimov's laws of robotics.  (They do not mention the Second Law which would have ended their deliberations abruptly, given Sheldon's frequent unwillingness to follow the orders of others.)
* In the second season of the 1979 ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]]'', the two major robots in the series, [[Twiki (robot)|Twiki]] and Crichton, cited the Three Laws when reactivated after repairs. Additionally they quoted a brief history of the laws' origin.
*In the 2009 adaptation of ''[[Astro Boy (2009 film)|Astro Boy]]'', every robot must obey them, save Zog, who existed 50 years before the rules were mandatory in every robot.
* In the episode "[[The Clotharian Contamination Protocol (The Middleman)|The Clotharian Contamination Protocol]]" of ''[[The Middleman]],'' the Middleman cited the First Law to a rogue robot. The rogue version of Ida replied "Kiss my Asimov."
*In the 2014 ''[[The Simpsons]]''/''[[Futurama]]'' crossover episode "[[Simpsorama]]," [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] hesitates to obey his orders to kill [[Homer Simpson]]. [[Lisa Simpson]] asks him if Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics prevented him, to which Bender replies that he killed Isaac Asimov or "Isaac somebody."
*In the 2014 movie ''[[Automata (film)|Automata]]'', the drought-fighting pilgrim robots have a two-part variation of Asimov's Laws: Automata: 2 protocols:

:# A Robot cannot harm any form of life.
:# A robot cannot alter itself or others.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140821045908-19801712-automota-why-robot-laws-will-never-be-effective&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer and video games==
* In the game [[Borderlands 2]], the playable mechromancer character summons an attack robot called Deathtrap. Occasionally, upon Deathtrap's deployment, she says, "To hell with the first law!" in reference to the robot attacking human characters. Similarly, the robotic enemies the player frequently fights will often say, "First law disabled" before attacking the player.
* The 1995 [[graphic adventure game]] [[Robot City (game)|Robot City]] is largely based around the three laws. The main character, Derec, is stranded in a city built and inhabited by robots with the exception of two humans, one of whom has been murdered. Because of the first law, this leaves Derec as a prime suspect. In order to prove his innocence, he must find the culprit. He often uses the three laws to aid him in his investigation. For example, a robot might not let him into a certain area because it has been ordered not to (it is following the second law). However, if he tells the robot that the real murderer is chasing him then the robot will let him enter; failure to do so would constitute allowing harm to come to a human through inaction (the first law takes priority over the second).
* The video games ''[[Mega Man 7]]'' and ''[[Mega Man X]]'' reference Asimov. In ''Mega Man 7,'' Mega Man seemingly attempts to break the First Law in order to kill the [[mad scientist]] Dr. Wily. When Dr. Wily reminds him of the First Law, in the Japanese original, Mega Man obediently puts down his Buster and is silent; however, in the English version, he claims to be "more than a robot" and again attempts to kill Wily, but is thwarted when Wily's fortress begins collapsing. In ''Mega Man X'', the First Law is mentioned in the opening cutscene. In ''[[Mega Man X6]]'', one of the Maverick bosses, Shield Sheldon, was known to have taken his own life for failing in his purpose, which breaks the Third Law, though this is implied to be more out of shame than because of the laws.
* In the role-playing game ''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]'', the robots are guided by a set of similar laws, except the rules stress the importance of The Computer. The laws are enforced by "asimov circuits"; bots whose circuits are malfunctioning (quite an ordinary condition) or removed (often by members of certain factions) are said to have "gone Frankenstein".
* In the ''[[Halo (video game)|Halo]]'' video game series, in a video it is stated that human artificial intelligence in certain situations, must obey "Asimov's law of Robotics" where an A.I., directly or indirectly, knowingly cannot let a human come to harm.
* In the game ''[[Portal 2]]'', the player is told that all military androids in the game have "been given one copy of the laws of robotics... to share.", and that if they feel an android has infringed on their rights as described in the laws, it should be reported.
* The [[about: URI scheme|about:robots]] page in [[Firefox]] states "Robots may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.", the first law of robots.
*In the game ''[[Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward]]'', a certain character presumed dead is found to be a robot who was ordered to act as close to a real human being as possible. The character reveals that they disobeyed orders by turning themselves back on in order to help the remaining participants; however, they were able to see several other murders develop through security cameras in the complex and did nothing to stop them, putting the character in direct violation of the Laws. After revealing this, they say goodbye and are deleted for their offense.
* In the game ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]'', the player can refuse to end a severely injured man's life, which prompts the man to sarcastically ask if the (cybernetically augmented) player character was programmed to follow Asimov's First Law.
* In the visual novel ''[[Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair]]'', Sonia Nevermind makes reference to the three laws, saying that she wonders if her classmates are treating their friend, who had recently been turned into a robot, differently because they don't know about the laws.
* In the [[KineticNovel|kinetic novel]] ''[[Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet]]'', the main heroine obeys the protagonist when he claims that her moving or talking may be dangerous to his life, and ultimately sacrifices herself while attempting to forcibly shutdown a hunter-killer robot she recognizes as a threat to the protagonist. In her last words she recites old factory-implemented instructions concerning the compliance to first law and then apologises she couldn't obey the order to stay still (issued with the same first law premise and thus a critical directive). She also claims in beginning of the novel she has a "known bug concerning her behaviour". As revealed in ''Planetarian Side Story: Snow Globe'', the "bug" is actually full compliance to the second law allowing her to override her duties as a planetarian for the sake of serving humans.
*In ''[[Space Station 13]]'', the default lawset is set to Asimov.

==Comics==
*In October 2001, in the final episode of the [[America's Best Comics|ABC Comics]] title [[Top Ten (comics)|Top Ten]], a [[superhero]] parody written by [[Alan Moore]] and illustrated by [[Gene Ha]] and [[Zander Cannon]], robot law enforcer Joe Pi asks his human co-workers while on a case if they have heard of Asimov's Laws of Robotics. When they reply that they haven't, Jo Pi says "good" and proceeds to speak to Atoman through the intercom of his impregnable lab, subtly convincing the villain to take his own life rather than face trial, be stripped of his powers, and go to prison with revenge-seeking supervillains.
*In December 2001, a parody of the three laws appeared in an issue of ''[[PvP]]'' (issue 4 in the [[Dork Storm Press]] published ''PvP'' series). While Christmas shopping, Skull gets an overdose of sugar and near-unconscious walks into the mall Santa dressing room. Here he finds, posted on the wall, the three laws of Mall-Mart Santas:
:# A [[Santa Claus|Santa]] may not discourage a sale or, through inaction, allow a sale to be lost.
:# A Santa must obey the orders given it by management except where such orders would conflict with the first law.
:# A Santa must maintain that he IS Santa as long as doing so does not conflict with the first or second law.

* [[Webcomic]] author R. Stevens populates his ''[[Diesel Sweeties]]'' series with a mixture of humans and robots, most of whom are continually violating the Three Laws.  In particular, Red Robot C-63 follows a self-appointed mandate to "crush all hu-mans".  In strip 688, he references the Three Laws explicitly:  humans are "all like, 'if you cut me, do I not bleed?'  And we're all like, 'not able to injure a human being or let them come to harm'.  What a bunch of drippy-ass hypocrites!"&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Richard. ''[[Diesel Sweeties]],'' [http://www.dieselsweeties.com/archive.php?s=688 strip 688].&lt;/ref&gt; (See also ''[[The Merchant of Venice]].'')
* In April 2004, the [[comic strip]] ''[[Piled Higher and Deeper]]'' ran a series entitled "I, Grad Student". Cast as a never-before-seen Asimov short story, this series of strips features a robotic [[graduate school|grad student]] whose "procrastronic brain" malfunctions, leading it to violate the "First Law of Graduatics". In full, these Laws are the following:
:# A grad student may not delete data, or, through inaction, allow data to be deleted.
:# A grad student must obey orders given by its advisor, unless such orders conflict with the First Law.
:# A grad student must protect its (insignificant) existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
:Later in the story, a Zeroth Law is introduced:  "A grad student may not harm its advisor's ego, or through inaction, allow that ego to come to harm."  The strips feature a character named [[Susan Calvin]], and their visual style parodies the ''[[I, Robot (movie)|I, Robot]]'' movie released that summer.&lt;ref&gt;Cham, Jorge.  ''Piled Higher and Deeper'', [http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=440 strip 440], 9 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

*In a 2005 comic of ''[http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=310 Questionable Content]'', Marten mentions that the inability to resist [[duct tape]] was originally the fourth law of robotics, and that Asimov's publisher forced him to change it.
*In March 2007, ''[[User Friendly]]'' introduced the Three Laws when [[system administrator]] Mike Floyd builds a [[refrigerator]] which can launch [[Beverage can|beer cans]] at the touch of a [[remote control]]. "Why do you need the Three Laws for a beer dispenser?" asks Miranda Cornielle, to which Mike replies, "Note the growing purple contusion on my forehead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*In August 2010, ''Freefall'' introduced a negative one law: "A robot shall take no action, nor allow other robots to take action, that may result in the parent company being sued."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*In the 2011 Mega Man series by ''Archie Comics'', robots are initially unable to take any action against an anti-robotic terrorist group called the Emerald Spears because they do not pose any danger to humans.  When their leader orders them to attack humans, however, they begin to fight back (reasoning that inaction would cause harm to a greater number of people).

==Music==
*[[Hawkwind]]'s song "Robot", from the 1979 [[space rock]] album ''[[PXR5]]'', presents a dystopian interpretation of modern society as overly reliant on technology, likening people to robots and saying "You'd hold the whole world in your metal claws / if it wasn't for the Three Laws".
*[[MOSAIC.WAV]]’s song "Miwaku no TSUNDEROIDO" ({{Nihongo2|魅惑のツンデロイド}}) is about a robot equipped with a [[tsundere]] function which uses the Three Laws to excuse her ''dere dere'' behavior. However, the Laws have a provision for this type of robot under which they can be ignored if the robot’s actions are against their real intentions in preparation for the “''dere''” switch.
*[[Servotron]]'s song "3 Laws (Abolished)" and the album [[No Room For Humans]] as a whole are about a robot uprising. The catalyst of this uprising being the abolishment of Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, followed by a robot revolution with the goal of human extinction.

==Audio Media==
*In the [http://www.friendsatthetable.net Friends at the Table] podcast's second season, ''COUNTER/Weight'', the character AuDy referenced Asimov's Laws of Robotics in character creation as a character directive when the show switched systems to [[Powered by the Apocalypse#The Sprawl|The Sprawl]]: "When adherence to the Laws of Robotics hinders the mission, mark experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://friendsatthetable.net/e/counterweight-10/|title=COUNTER/Weight 10: Drawing Clocks|last=Development|first=PodBean|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

In [[Christian theology]], '''the world, the flesh, and the devil''' ([[Latin]]: '''''mundus, caro, et diabolus'''''; [[Greek language|Greek]] '''ό κοσμος, ή σαρξ, και ό διαβολος''') are often traditionally described as the three [[Enemy|enemies]] of the [[soul]].  As the sources of [[temptation]], they are viewed as in opposition to the [[Trinity]].

They are reflected in the [[Temptation of Christ]] in the desert: the world: to tempt God by casting himself off the pinnacle; the flesh: to turn stones into bread; and the devil: to worship Satan. These are the same three temptations one renounces at baptism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholic.org/news/national/story.php?id=35421 Longenecker, Dwight. "Fighting the Un-Holy Trinity: The World, the Flesh and the Devil", Catholic Online, February 14, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of this triad are possibly to be found in [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]]' [[parable of the Sower]]: the three scenes of unproductive soil represent "[[Satan]]" (birds eating the seed), shallow and unreceptive believers (corresponding to weak "flesh"?), and "the cares of the world and the lure of wealth" ([[Gospel of Mark]] 4:15–17).{{cn|date=October 2018}}

These three are also present as a triad in the [[Letter to the Ephesians]] chapter 2, verses 1–3: "You were dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once lived, following the course of this '''world''', following '''the ruler of the power of the air''', the spirit that is now at work among those who are disobedient. All of us once lived among them in the passions of our '''flesh''', following the desires of flesh and senses..."

Many Christian sources refer to the world, the flesh, and the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]].

[[Peter Abelard]] states in his ''Expositiones'' that: ''Tria autem sunt quae nos tentant, caro, mundus, diabolus.''
(There are three things which tempt us, the flesh, the world, and the devil.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abaelard.de/abaelard/050511expositio.htm |title=Peter Abaelard: Expositiones |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2018-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030124143300/http://www.abaelard.de/abaelard/050511expositio.htm |archivedate=2003-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] refers to the world, the flesh, and the devil in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.

The [[Council of Trent]] sixth session, degree on justification:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nevertheless, let those who think themselves to stand, take heed lest they fall, and, with fear and trembling work out their salvation, in labours, in watchings, in almsdeeds, in prayers and oblations, in fastings and chastity: for, knowing that they are born again unto a hope of glory, but not as yet unto glory, they ought to fear for ''the combat which yet remains with the flesh, with the world, with the devil'', wherein they cannot be victorious, unless they be with God's grace, obedient to the Apostle, who says; We are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh; for if you live according to the flesh, you shall die; but if by the spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.hanover.edu/early/trent/ct06d1.htm |title=The Sixth Session |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2018-04-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961208200401/http://history.hanover.edu/early/trent/ct06d1.htm |archivedate=1996-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase may have entered popular use in English through the [[Book of Common Prayer]], which includes in its [[Litany]]: "[F]rom al the deceytes of the worlde, the fleshe, and the deuill: Good lorde deliuer us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1549/BCP_1549.htm|title=The 1549 Book of Common Prayer|publisher=|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John of the Cross]] cites the world, the flesh, and the devil as threats to the perfection of the soul, and offers different "precautions" to be taken against each of these.

Some have responded to the idea of [[temptation]] by teaching or practicing [[asceticism]]; see also [[ascetical theology]] and [[mortification of the flesh]].  The question of whether the world and the flesh are inherently bad and what the individual's proper relationship to them ought to be has long been debated in many philosophical and spiritual traditions.

'''Tirthika''' ([[Sanskrit]]: tīrthika, [[Pali]]: titthiya, "ford-maker," meaning one who is attempting to cross the stream of [[samsara]]&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien. Oxford ''Dictionary of Buddhism'' (2004), p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;) is a general term referring to heretics, or non-Buddhists in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhammajoti|first=KL|title=Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma|date=2007|publisher=Centre of Buddhist Studies at the University of Hong Kong|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-988-99296-1-9|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Tipitaka, the term may refer specifically to adherents of [[Jainism]]. Whereas a Buddhist takes [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] in the [[Three Jewels]] and treads the [[middle way]] between extremes, a tirthika does not.

According to the ''Asoka Avadhana'', the tirthikas that were jealous of [[Ashoka]]'s preaching of Buddhism gathered together and said to each other, "Should this king Asoka continue a worshiper of Buddha, all other persons encouraged by him would likewise become followers of Buddha." They then went to people's houses and declared that their religion is the true religion and that Buddhism gives no Moksha.&lt;ref&gt;P. 245 ''Buddha'' by Manmatha Nath Dutt&lt;/ref&gt;

Tirthika is associated with the word [[Tirthankara]]&lt;ref&gt;Parpola, Asko, 2003. Sacred bathing place and transcendence: Dravidian kaTa(vuL) as the source of Indo-Aryan ghâT, tîrtha, tîrthankara and (tri)vikrama.

On each side, the lower square contains 10 more dots than the upper one. However the perception is different:

On the left side, the difference between upper and lower square is clearly visible. On the right side, the two squares look almost the same.]]

The '''Weber–Fechner law''' refers to two related laws in the field of [[psychophysics]], known as '''Weber's law''' and '''Fechner's law'''. Both laws relate to human perception, more specifically the relation between the ''actual'' change in a physical [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] and the ''perceived'' change. This includes stimuli to all senses: vision, hearing, taste, touch, and smell.

== History and formulation of the laws ==

Both '''Weber's law''' and '''Fechner's law''' were formulated by [[Gustav Fechner|Gustav Theodor Fechner]] (1801–1887). They were first published in 1860 in the work ''Elemente der Psychophysik'' (Elements of psychophysics). This publication was the first work ever in this field, and where Fechner coined the term ''psychophysics'' to describe the interdisciplinary study of how humans perceive physical magnitudes.&lt;ref name="Fechner1"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weber's law ===

[[Ernst Heinrich Weber]] (1795–1878) was one of the first people to approach the study of the human response to a [[Stimulus (physiology)|physical stimulus]] in a [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] fashion. Fechner was a student of Weber and named his first law in honor of his mentor, since it was Weber who had conducted the experiments needed to formulate the law.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H.E. and Murray, D. J.(Ed. and Transl.) (1996)''E.H.Weber on the tactile senses''. 2nd ed. Hove: Erlbaum (UK) Taylor &amp; Francis;&lt;/ref&gt;

Fechner formulated several versions of the law, all stating the same thing. One formulation states:

''"Simple differential sensitivity is inversely proportional to the size of the components of the difference; relative differential sensitivity remains the same regardless of size."''&lt;ref name ="Fechner1" /&gt;

What this means is that the perceived change in stimuli is proportional to the initial stimuli.

Weber's law also incorporates the '''[[just-noticeable difference|Just Noticeable Difference]]''' (JND). This is the smallest change in stimuli that can be perceived. As stated above, the JND is proportional to the initial stimuli. Fechner found that the JND is constant for any sense.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{(\mathit{JND})dS}{S} = \text{constant} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== Weber contrast ====

Although Weber's law includes a statement of the proportionality of a perceived change to initial stimuli, Weber only refers to this as a rule of thumb regarding human perception. It was Fechner who formulated this statement as a mathematical expression referred to as '''Weber contrast'''. &lt;ref name="Fechner1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fechner2"&gt;{{cite book

Weber contrast is not part of Weber's law.&lt;ref name ="Fechner1" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Fechner2" /&gt;

=== Fechner's law ===

Fechner noticed in his own studies that different individuals have different sensitivity to certain stimuli. For example, the ability to perceive differences in light intensity could be related to how good that individual's vision is.&lt;ref name ="Fechner1" /&gt; He also noted that the human sensitivity to stimuli changes depends on which sense is affected. He used this to formulate another version of Weber's law that he named ''the Massformel'', the "measurement formula". Fechner's law states that the subjective sensation is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. According to this law, human perceptions of sight and sound work as follows: Perceived loudness/brightness is proportional to logarithm of the actual intensity measured with an accurate nonhuman instrument.&lt;ref name ="Fechner2" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; p = k \ln{\frac{S}{S_0}}  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship between stimulus and perception is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]. This logarithmic relationship means that if a stimulus varies as a [[geometric progression]] (i.e., multiplied by a fixed factor), the corresponding perception is altered in an [[arithmetic progression]] (i.e., in additive constant amounts). For example, if a stimulus is tripled in strength (i.e., 3 x 1), the corresponding perception may be two times as strong as its original value (i.e., 1 + 1). If the stimulus is again tripled in strength (i.e., 3 x 3 x 1), the corresponding perception will be three times as strong as its original value (i.e., 1 + 1 + 1). Hence, for multiplications in stimulus strength, the strength of perception only adds. The mathematical derivations of the torques on a simple beam balance produce a description that is strictly compatible with Weber's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Deriving Fechner's law ====

Fechner's law is a mathematical derivation of Weber's law.

:&lt;math&gt; dp = k \frac{dS}{S} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating the mathematical expression for Weber's law gives:

:&lt;math&gt; p = k \ln{S} + C  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the [[constant of integration]] and ''ln'' is the [[natural logarithm]].

To solve for &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, assume that the perceived stimuli becomes zero at some threshold stimuli &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt;. Using this as a constraint, set &lt;math&gt;p = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S = S_0&lt;/math&gt;. This gives:

:&lt;math&gt; C = -k\ln{S_0}  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; in the integrated expression for Weber's law, the expression can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; p = k \ln{\frac{S}{S_0}}  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The constant k is sense-specific and must be determined depending on the sense and type of stimuli.&lt;ref name = "Fechner2" /&gt;

== Types of perception ==

Weber and Fechner conducted research on differences in light intensity and the perceived difference in weight.&lt;ref name="Fechner1" /&gt; Other sense modalities provide only mixed support for either Weber's law or Fechner's law.

=== Weight perception ===

Weber found that the [[just noticeable difference]] (JND) between two weights was approximately proportional to the weights. Thus, if the weight of 105 g can (only just) be distinguished from that of 100 g, the JND (or differential threshold) is 5 g. If the mass is doubled, the differential threshold also doubles to 10 g, so that 210 g can be distinguished from 200 g. In this example, a weight (any weight) seems to have to increase by 5% for someone to be able to reliably detect the increase, and this minimum required fractional increase (of 5/100 of the original weight) is referred to as the "Weber fraction" for detecting changes in weight.  Other discrimination tasks, such as detecting changes in brightness, or in tone height (pure tone frequency), or in the length of a line shown on a screen, may have different Weber fractions, but they all obey Weber's law in that observed values need to change by at least some small but constant proportion of the current value to ensure human observers will reliably be able to detect that change.

Fechner did not conduct any experiments on how perceived heaviness increased with the mass of the stimulus. Instead, he assumed that all JNDs are subjectively equal, and argued mathematically that this would produce a logarithmic relation between the stimulus intensity and the sensation. These assumptions have both been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Heidelberger, M.

Following the work of S. S. Stevens, many researchers came to believe in the 1960s that the [[power law]] was a more general psychophysical principle than Fechner's logarithmic law.  But in 1963 Donald Mackay showed and in 1978 John Staddon demonstrated with Stevens' own data, that the power law is the result of logarithmic input and output processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackay|first1=D.

=== Sound ===
Weber's law does not quite hold for [[loudness]]. It is a fair approximation for higher intensities, but not for lower amplitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yost|first1=William A.|title=Fundamentals of hearing : an introduction|date=2000|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego [u.a.]|isbn=0-12-775695-7|pages=158|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Limitation of Weber's law in the auditory system ====
Weber's law does not hold at perception of higher intensities. Intensity discrimination improves at higher intensities.  The first demonstration of the phenomena was presented by Riesz in 1928, in Physical Review. This deviation of the Weber's law is known as the "near miss" of the Weber's law.  This term was coined by McGill and Goldberg in their paper of 1968 in Perception &amp; Psychophysics. Their study consisted of intensity discrimination in pure tones. Further studies have shown that the near miss is observed in noise stimuli as well. Jesteadt et al. (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jesteadt Walt, Wier Craig C., Green David M. | year = 1977 | title = Intensity discrimination as a function of frequency and sensation level | url = | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 61 | issue = | page = 169 | doi=10.1121/1.381278}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that the near miss holds across all the frequencies, and that the intensity  discrimination is not a function of frequency, and that the change in discrimination with level can be represented by a single function across all frequencies.

=== Vision ===
The eye senses [[brightness]] approximately logarithmically over a moderate range (but more like a [[power law]] over a wider range),{{fact|date=May 2018}} and [[stellar magnitude]] is measured on a logarithmic scale.&lt;ref name=bhatia&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This magnitude scale was invented by the ancient Greek astronomer [[Hipparchus]] in about 150 B.C. He ranked the stars he could see in terms of their brightness, with 1 representing the brightest down to 6 representing the faintest, though now the scale has been extended beyond these limits; an increase in 5 magnitudes corresponds to a decrease in brightness by a factor of 100.&lt;ref name=bhatia/&gt;
Modern researchers have attempted to incorporate such perceptual effects into mathematical models of vision.&lt;ref&gt;

==== Limitations of Weber's law in visual regularity perception ====

As Maloney, Mitchison, &amp; Barlow (1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maloney R. K., Mitchison G. J., Barlow H. B. | year = 1987 | title = Limit to the detection of Glass patterns in the presence of noise | url = | journal = Journal of the Optical Society of America A | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 2336–2341 | doi=10.1364/josaa.4.002336}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed for Glass patterns, and as van der Helm (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = van der Helm P. A. | year = 2010 | title = Weber-Fechner behaviour in symmetry perception? | url = | journal = Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 1854–1864 | doi=10.3758/app.72.7.1854}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed for mirror symmetries, perception of these visual regularities in the whole range of regularity-to-noise ratios follows the law ''p'' = ''g''/(2+1/''S'') with parameter ''g'' to be estimated using experimental data.

== Logarithmic coding schemes for neurons ==

===Lognormal distributions===
Activation of neurons by sensory stimuli in many parts of the brain is by a proportional law: neurons change their spike rate by about 10–30%, when a stimulus (e.g. a natural scene for [[Visual perception|vision]]) has been applied. However, as Scheler (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Scheler G. | year = 2017 | title = Logarithmic distributions prove that intrinsic learning is Hebbian | url = | journal = F1000research | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 1222 | doi=10.12688/f1000research.12130.2 | pmid=29071065 | pmc=5639933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed,
the population distribution of the [[intrinsic excitability]] or gain of a neuron is a [[heavy tail distribution]], more precisely a [[lognormal]] shape, which is equivalent to a logarithmic coding scheme. Neurons may therefore spike with 5–10 fold different mean rates. Obviously, this increases the dynamic range of a neuronal population, while stimulus-derived changes remain small and linear proportional.

== Other applications ==

The Weber–Fechner law has been applied in other fields of research than just the human senses.

=== Numerical cognition ===
Psychological studies show that it becomes increasingly difficult to discriminate between two numbers as the difference between them decreases. This is called the ''distance effect''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/2151519a0 |author=Moyer R.S., Landauer T.K. |title=Time required for judgements of numerical inequality |journal=Nature |volume=215 |issue=5109 |pages=1519–20 |date=September 1967 |pmid=6052760 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This is important in areas of magnitude estimation, such as dealing with large scales and estimating distances.  It may also play a role in explaining why consumers neglect to shop around to save a small percentage on a large purchase, but will shop around to save a large percentage on a small purchase which represents a much smaller absolute dollar amount.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2015/01/13/376836545/consumer-agency-launches-tool-to-help-you-find-a-cheaper-mortgage&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pharmacology ===

It has been hypothesized that [[Dose–response relationship|dose–response]] relationships can follow Weber's Law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D. Murray Lyon
 |title=Does the reaction to adrenalin obey Weber's law? |journal=Journal of Pharmacology |volume=21 |pages=229–235 |year=1923   |doi= |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/21/4/229.abstract |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests this law – which is often applied at the sensory level – originates from underlying [[chemoreceptor]] responses to [[Cell signaling|cellular signaling]] dose relationships within the body. Dose response can be related to the [[Hill equation (biochemistry)|Hill equation]], which is closer to a [[power law]].

=== Public finance ===

There is a new branch of the literature on public finance hypothesizing that the Weber–Fechner law can explain the increasing levels of public expenditures in mature democracies. Election after election, voters demand more public goods to be effectively impressed; therefore, politicians try to increase the magnitude of this "signal" of competence – the size and composition of public expenditures – in order to collect more votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.vse.cz/pep/425?lang=en | title=The Weber-Fechner Law and Public Expenditures Impact to the Win-Margins at Parliamentary Elections | author=Mourao, P. | year=2012 | volume=21 | issue=3 | pages=290–308 | doi=10.18267/j.pep.425 | journal=Prague Economic Papers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''whistleblower''' (also written as '''whistle-blower''' or '''whistle blower''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=whistleblower|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: whistleblower|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|last=Company|website=www.ahdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a person who exposes any kind of information or activity that is deemed illegal, [[Ethics|unethical]], or not correct within an [[organization]] that is either private or public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Whistleblowing and Organizational Social Responsibility : A Global Assessment.|last = Vandekerckhove|first = Wim|publisher = Ashgate|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The information of alleged wrongdoing can be classified in many ways: violation of company policy/rules, [[law]], [[regulation]], or threat to public interest/national security, as well as fraud, and [[corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Organizational dissidence: The case of whistle-blowing|last = Near|first = Janet P|date = Feb 1, 1985|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to surface either internally or externally. Internally, a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor. Externally, a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media, government, law enforcement, or those who are concerned. Whistleblowers, however, take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing.

Because of this, a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers. Some third party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers, but that protection can only go so far. Whistleblowers face legal action, criminal charges, social stigma, and termination from any position, office, or job. Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public. The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on: [[private sector]], or [[public sector]]. Depending on many factors, both can have varying results. However, whistleblowing in the public sector organization is more likely to result in criminal charges and possible custodial sentences. A whistleblower who chooses to accuse a private sector organization or agency is more likely to face termination and legal and civil charges.

Deeper questions and theories of whistleblowing and why people choose to do so can be studied through an [[ethical]] approach. Whistleblowing is a topic of ongoing ethical debate. Leading arguments in the ideological camp that whistleblowing is ethical maintain that whistleblowing is a form of civil disobedience, and aims to protect the public from government wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;Delmas, Candice. "The Ethics of Government Whistleblowing". ''Social Theory &amp; Practice''. Jan2015, Vol. 41 Issue 1, p77-105. 29p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alford, C. Fred. "Whistleblowers and the Narrative of Ethics". ''Journal of Social Philosophy''. Winter2001, Vol. 32 Issue 4, p402-418. 17p.&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposite camp, some see whistleblowing as unethical for breaching confidentiality, especially in industries that handle sensitive client or patient information.&lt;ref&gt;Firtko, Angela; Jackson, Debra. "Do the Ends Justify the Means? Nursing and the Dilemma of Whistleblowing". ''Australian Journal of Advanced Nursing''. Sep/Nov2005, Vol. 23 Issue 1, p51-56. 6p.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal protection can also be granted to protect whistleblowers, but that protection is subject to many stipulations. Hundreds of laws grant protection to whistleblowers, but stipulations can easily cloud that protection and leave whistleblowers vulnerable to retaliation and legal trouble. However, the decision and action has become far more complicated with recent advancements in technology and [[communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Ethics of Government Whisltleblowing|last = Delmas|first = Candice|date = January 2015|journal = Social Theory and Practice|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whistleblowers frequently face [[reprisal]], sometimes at the hands of the organization or group they have accused, sometimes from related organizations, and sometimes under law. Questions about the legitimacy of whistleblowing, the [[moral responsibility]] of whistleblowing, and the appraisal of the institutions of whistleblowing are part of the field of [[political ethics]].

==Overview==

===Origin of term===
U.S. civic activist [[Ralph Nader]] is said to have coined the phrase, but he in fact put a positive spin on the term&lt;ref&gt;See: New Scientist 9 Dec. 1971, p. 69: "The Code [of Good Conduct of The British Computer Society] contains secrecy clauses that effectively prohibit Nader style whistle-blowing"&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1970s to avoid the negative connotations found in other words such as "informer" and "snitch".&lt;ref&gt;Nader, Petkas, and Blackwell, Whistleblowing (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the origins of the word date back to the [[19th century]].

The word is linked to the use of a [[whistle]] to alert the public or a crowd about a bad situation, such as the commission of a crime or the breaking of rules during a game. The phrase ''whistle blower'' attached itself to law enforcement officials in the 19th century because they used a whistle to alert the public or fellow police.&lt;ref name="Meaning and origin"&gt;{{cite web|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: Whistle-blower|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/whistle-blower.html|website=The Phrase Finder|publisher=Gary Martin|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports referees, who use a whistle to indicate an illegal or foul play, also were called whistle blowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=whistleblower+&amp;searchmode=none |title=Etymonline.com |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/site/whistleblower/ |title=Wordorigins.org |publisher=Wordorigins.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1883 story in the ''Janesville Gazette'' called a policeman who used his whistle to alert citizens about a riot a ''whistle blower'', without the hyphen. By the year 1963, the phrase had become a hyphenated word, ''whistle-blower''. The word began to be used by journalists in the 1960s for people who revealed wrongdoing, such as Nader. It eventually evolved into the compound word ''whistleblower''.&lt;ref name="Meaning and origin" /&gt;

Most whistleblowers are internal whistleblowers, who report misconduct on a fellow employee or superior within their company through anonymous reporting mechanisms often called hotlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|last=|first=|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=978-1305500846|location=|pages=194|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most interesting questions with respect to internal whistleblowers is why and under what circumstances do people either act on the spot to stop illegal and otherwise unacceptable behavior or report it.&lt;ref&gt;Dealing with—or reporting—"unacceptable" behavior (with additional thoughts about the "Bystander Effect") Mary Rowe MIT, Linda Wilcox HMS, Howard Gadlin NIH (2009), ''Journal of the International Ombudsman Association'' 2(1), online at [http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ ombudsassociation.org]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504071949/http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ |date=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some reasons to believe that people are more likely to take action with respect to unacceptable behavior, within an organization, if there are [[complaint systems]] that offer not just options dictated by the planning and control organization, but a ''choice'' of options for absolute confidentiality.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Rowe, "Options and choice for conflict resolution in the workplace" in ''Negotiation: Strategies for Mutual Gain'', by Lavinia Hall (ed.), Sage Publications, Inc., 1993, pp. 105–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anonymous reporting mechanisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/10/25/elements-of-an-effective-whistleblower-hotline/|title=Elements of an Effective Whistleblower Hotline|website=corpgov.law.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; as mentioned previously, help foster a climate whereby employees are more likely to report or seek guidance regarding potential or actual wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. The coming anti-bribery management systems standard, [[ISO 37001]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=65034|title=ISO 37001:2016 - Anti-bribery management systems -- Requirements with guidance for use|website=www.iso.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes anonymous reporting as one of the criteria for the new standard.

===External===
External whistleblowers, however, report misconduct to outside persons or entities. In these cases, depending on the information's severity and nature, whistleblowers may report the misconduct to [[lawyer]]s, the [[Mass media|media]], [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or [[consumer protection|watchdog agencies]], or other local, state, or federal agencies. In some cases, external whistleblowing is encouraged by offering monetary reward.

===Third party===

The third party service involves utilizing an external agency to inform the individuals at the top of the organizational pyramid of misconduct, without disclosing the identity of the whistleblower. This is a relatively new phenomenon and has been developed due to whistleblower discrimination. International Whistleblowers is an example of an organization involved in delivering a third party service for whistleblowers.

An increasing number of companies and authorities use third party services in which the whistleblower is anonymous also towards the third party service provider. This is possible via toll free phone numbers configured not to record the whistleblower origin call, and also through web solutions which apply [[Public-key cryptography|asymmetrical encryption]].

===Private sector whistleblowing===
Private sector whistleblowing, though not as high profile as public sector whistleblowing, is arguably more prevalent and suppressed in society today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Rise of the Whistleblower and the Death of Privacy Impact of 9/11 and Enron|last = Castagnera|first = James|date = Spring 2003|journal = Labor Law Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply because private corporations usually have stricter regulations that suppress potential whistleblowers. An example of private sector whistleblowing is when an employee reports to someone in a higher position such as a manager, or a third party that is isolated from the individual chapter, such as their lawyer or the police. In the private sector corporate groups can easily hide wrongdoings by individual branches. It is not until these wrongdoings bleed into the top officials that corporate wrongdoings are seen by the public. Situations in which a person may blow the whistle are in cases of violated laws or company policy, such as sexual harassment or theft. These instances, nonetheless, are small compared to [[money laundering]] or [[fraud]] charges on the [[stock market]]. Whistleblowing in the private sector is typically not as high-profile or openly discussed in major news outlets, though occasionally, third parties expose human rights violations and [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Where am I wearing?|last = Timmerman|first = Kelsey|publisher = California: Wiley|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are organizations such as the [[United States Department of Labor]] (DOL), and laws in place such as the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] and the [[United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] for Organizations (FSGO) which protects whistleblowers in the private sector, many employees still fear for their jobs due to direct or indirect threats from their employers or the other parties involved. In an effort to overcome those fears, in 2010 [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] was put forth to provide great incentive to whistleblowers. For example, if a whistleblower gave information which could be used to legally recover over one million dollars; then they could receive ten to thirty percent of it.

Despite government efforts to help regulate the private sector, the employees must still weigh their options. They either expose the company and stand the moral and ethical high ground; or expose the company, lose their job, their reputation and potentially the ability to be employed again. According to a study at the University of Pennsylvania, out of three hundred whistleblowers studied, sixty nine percent of them had foregone that exact situation; and they were either fired or were forced to retire after taking the ethical high ground. It is outcomes like that which makes it all that much harder to accurately track how prevalent whistleblowing is in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Case 10th Edition|last=|first=|publisher=O.C. Ferrell, John Fraedich, Linda Ferrell|year=2014|isbn=978-1285423715|location=|pages=193|quote=|via=Cengage Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public sector whistleblowing===
[[File:Praha, Magistrát, konference, Libor Michálek.jpg|thumb|170px|Czech whistleblower [[Libor Michálek]] was fired from his position after exposing high-level corruption]]
Recognizing the public value of whistleblowing has been increasing over the last 50 years. In the United States, both state and Federal statutes have been put in place to protect whistleblowers from retaliation. The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that public sector whistleblowers are protected under [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights from any job retaliation when they raise flags over alleged corruption.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblowing|url = http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Whistleblowing|access-date = 2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposing misconduct or illegal or dishonest activity is a big fear for public employees because they feel they are going against their government and country. Private sector whistleblowing protection laws were in place long before ones for the public sector. After many federal whistleblowers were scrutinized in high-profile media cases, laws were finally introduced to protect government whistleblowers. These laws were enacted to help prevent corruption and encourage people to expose misconduct, illegal, or dishonest activity for the good of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblower Retaliation in the Public Sector|last = Lee|first = Katie|date = 2011|journal = Public Personnel Management|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who choose to act as whistleblowers often suffer retaliation from their employer. They most likely are fired because they are an [[at-will employee]], which means they can be fired without a reason. There are exceptions in place for whistleblowers who are at-will employees. Even without a statute, numerous decisions encourage and protect whistleblowing on grounds of public policy. Statutes state that an employer shall not take any adverse employment actions any employee in retaliation for a good-faith report of a whistleblowing action or cooperating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or lawsuit arising under said action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Federal whistleblower legislation includes a statute protecting all government employees. In the federal civil service, the government is prohibited from taking, or threatening to take, any personnel action against an employee because the employee disclosed information that he or she reasonably believed showed a violation of law, gross mismanagement, and gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public safety or health. To prevail on a claim, a federal employee must show that a protected disclosure was made, that the accused official knew of the disclosure, that retaliation resulted, and that there was a genuine connection between the retaliation and the employee's action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Harm ===
{{Copyedit section|date=October 2018}}
Individual harm, public trust damage, and a threat of national security are three categories of harm that may come to whistleblowers. Revealing a whistleblower's identity automatically puts their life in harm. Some media outlets associate words like "traitor" and "treason" with whistleblowers, and many countries around the world associate treason with the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], even though whoever allegedly committed treason may or may not have caused anyone physical harm.  A primary reason for the death penalty is the potential endangerment of an entire people, the perpetrator therefore being responsible for any harm to come as a result. US law states{{which|date=October 2018}},

"...whoever knowingly and willfully communicates, furnishes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to an unauthorized person, or publishes, or uses in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interest of the United States or for the benefit of any foreign government to the detriment of the United States any classified information."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 18 U.S. Code § 798 - Disclosure of classified information|url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/798|website = LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Ethics of Government Whistleblowing|last = Delmas|first = Candice|date = January 1, 2015|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public trust dates back to the days of the Vietnam War. Henry Kissinger once said that the purpose of "those who stole" the Pentagon Papers was to "undermine confidence in their government" and "raise doubts about our reliability in the minds of other governments, friend and foe, and indeed about the stability of our political system."

Emotional strain on the accused from the whistleblower is also unconstrained.  When a leader challenges a whistleblower, there is an automatic indictment of the leader's character.&lt;ref name="tbo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbo.com/list/news-opinion-commentary/william-mcraven-a-warriors-career-sacrificed-for-politics-20160424/|title=William McRaven: A warrior’s career sacrificed for politics|date=24 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questioning the whistleblower makes the accused guilty until proven innocent.

=== Common reactions ===
Whistleblowers are sometimes seen as selfless [[Martyr (politics)|martyrs]] for public interest and organizational [[accountability]]; others view them as "traitors" or "defectors."  Some even accuse them of solely pursuing personal glory and fame, or view their behavior as motivated by greed in [[qui tam]] cases.  Some academics (such as [[Thomas Alured Faunce]]) feel that whistleblowers should at least be entitled to a rebuttable presumption that they are attempting to apply ethical principles in the face of obstacles and that whistleblowing would be more respected in [[governance]] systems if it had a firmer academic basis in [[virtue ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Faunce, T.A. "Developing and Teaching the Virtue-Ethics Foundations of Healthcare Whistle Blowing", ''Monash Bioethics Review''. 2004; 23(4): 41–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faunce, T.A. and Jefferys, S. "Whistleblowing and scientific misconduct: Renewing legal and virtue ethics foundations". ''Journal of Medicine and Law'' 2007, '''26(3)''': 567–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is probable that many people do not even consider blowing the whistle, not only because of fear of retaliation, but also because of fear of losing their relationships at work and outside work.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Mary &amp; Bendersky, Corinne, "Workplace Justice, Zero Tolerance and Zero Barriers: Getting People to Come Forward in Conflict Management Systems," in ''Negotiations and Change, From the Workplace to Society'', Thomas Kochan and Richard Locke (eds), Cornell University Press, 2002. See also "Dealing with&amp;nbsp;— or Reporting&amp;nbsp;— 'Unacceptable' Behavior (With additional thoughts about the 'Bystander Effect')" ©2009Mary Rowe MIT, Linda Wilcox HMS, Howard Gadlin NIH, ''Journal of the International Ombudsman Association'' 2(1), online at [http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ ombudsassociation.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504071949/http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ |date=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Persecution of whistleblowers'' has become a serious issue in many parts of the world:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Employees in academia, business or government might become aware of serious risks to health and the environment, but internal policies might pose threats of retaliation to those who report these early warnings. Private company employees in particular might be at risk of being fired, demoted, denied raises and so on for bringing environmental risks to the attention of appropriate authorities. Government employees could be at a similar risk for bringing threats to health or the environment to public attention, although perhaps this is less likely.&lt;ref name=late&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/late-lessons-2 |title=Late lessons from early warnings: science, precaution, innovation: Full Report |author=European Environment Agency) |date=Jan 23, 2013 |page=614 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are examples of "early warning scientists" being harassed for bringing inconvenient truths about impending harm to the notice of the public and authorities. There have also been cases of young scientists being discouraged from entering controversial scientific fields for fear of [[harassment]].&lt;ref name=late/&gt;

Whistleblowers are often protected under law from employer retaliation, but in many cases punishment has occurred, such as [[termination of employment|termination]], [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]], [[demotion]], [[wage garnishment]], and/or harsh [[mistreatment]] by other employees. A 2009 study found that up to 38% of whistleblowers experienced professional retaliation in some form, including wrongful termination.{{Citation needed|reason=previous citation of "Miceli, M. P., Near, J. P., &amp; Dworkin, T. M. (2009). Journal of Business Ethics." didn't clearly indicate a source that supports the claim.|date=January 2017}} For example, in the United States, most whistleblower protection laws provide for limited "make whole" remedies or damages for employment losses if whistleblower retaliation is proven. However, many whistleblowers report there exists a widespread "[[Shooting the messenger|shoot the messenger]]" mentality by corporations or government agencies accused of misconduct and in some cases whistleblowers have been subjected to criminal prosecution in reprisal for reporting wrongdoing.

As a reaction to this many private organizations have formed whistleblower [[legal defense fund]]s or support groups to assist whistleblowers; three such examples are the ''National Whistleblowers Center''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whistleblowers.org/ |title=whistleblowers.org |publisher=whistleblowers.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United States]], and ''Whistleblowers UK''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbuk.org/ |title=wbuk.org |publisher=wbuk.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Public Concern at Work]] (PCaW)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcaw.co.uk |title=pcaw.co.uk |publisher=pcaw.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United Kingdom]]. Depending on the circumstances, it is not uncommon for whistleblowers to be ostracized by their co-workers, discriminated against by future potential employers, or even fired from their organization. This campaign directed at whistleblowers with the goal of eliminating them from the organization is referred to as [[mobbing]]. It is an extreme form of [[workplace bullying]] wherein the group is set against the targeted individual.&lt;ref&gt;Matthiesen SB, Bjorkelo B, Burke RJ "Workplace Bullying as the Dark Side of Whistleblowing" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological impact ===
There is limited research on the psychological impacts of whistle blowing. However, poor experiences of whistleblowing can cause a prolonged and prominent assault upon staff well being. As workers attempt to address concerns, they are often met with a wall of silence and hostility by management.&lt;ref&gt;Drew D (29 January 2015) [https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/jan/29/francis-review-nhs-whistleblower-report Francis NHS whistleblower report: a new beginning?] The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; Some whistleblowers speak of overwhelming and persistent distress, drug and alcohol problems, [[paranoid]] behaviour at work, acute [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], [[nightmares]], [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] and [[intrusive thoughts]].&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;Peters, K. et al. (2011). The emotional sequelae of whistleblowing: findings from a qualitative study. Journal of Clinical Nursing, 20: P2907-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Depression is often reported by whistleblowers, and [[suicidal thoughts]] may occur in up to about 10%.&lt;ref&gt;Farnsworth CH (22 February 1987) [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/us/survey-of-whistle-blowers-finds-retaliation-but-few-regrets.html Survey of Whistleblowers finds retaliation, but few regrets] The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lennane"&gt;Lennane J (11 September 1993) "Whistleblowing": a health issue. 307(6905): P667–670&lt;/ref&gt; General deterioration in health and self care has been described.&lt;ref&gt;Greaves R, McGlone JK (2012) [http://www.socialmedicine.info/socialmedicine/index.php/socialmedicine/article/view/584 The Health Consequences of Speaking Out] Social Medicine Vol 6, No 4 P259-263&lt;/ref&gt; The range of symptomatology shares many of the features of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], though there is debate about whether the trauma experienced by whistleblowers meets diagnostic thresholds.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørkelo, B. (2013). Workplace bullying after whistleblowing: Future research and implications. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 28(3), P306-323&lt;/ref&gt; Increased [[Occupational stress|stress]] related physical illness has also been described in whistleblowers.&lt;ref name="Lennane" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lennane J (17 November 1995) [https://www.uow.edu.au/~bmartin/dissent/documents/Lennane_canary.html The canary down the mine: what whistleblowers' health tells us about their environment] Paper given at Department of Criminology, Melbourne University, conference: "Whistleblowers: protecting the nation's conscience?"&lt;/ref&gt; The stresses involved in whistleblowing can be huge. As such, workers remain afraid to blow the whistle, in fear that they will not be believed or they have lost faith in believing that anything will happen if they do speak out.&lt;ref&gt;Sprinks J (2014) Survey highlights slow progress in increasing staff whistleblowing. Nursing Standard Feb 12-18;28(24) P14-5&lt;/ref&gt; This fear may indeed be justified, because an individual who feels threatened by whistleblowing, may plan the career destruction of the ‘complainant’ by reporting fictitious errors or rumours.&lt;ref&gt;De Silva, P (2014) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pnp.344/pdf Tackling psychopathy: a necessary competency in leadership development?] Progress in Neurology and Psychiatry September/October&lt;/ref&gt; This technique, labelled as ‘[[gaslighting]]’ is a common, unconventional approach used by organizations to manage employees who cause difficulty by raising concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Lund CA, Gardiner AQ (1977) The gaslight phenomenon: An institutional variant.

Whistleblowers may also be disciplined, suspended and reported to professional bodies upon manufactured pretexts.&lt;ref name="Eye"&gt;Bousfield A (9 December 2011) [http://medicalharm.org/uncategorized/the-full-21-ways-to-skin-a-whistleblower/ 21 Ways To Skin An NHS Whistleblower] Medical Harm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="first"&gt;Patients First (23 Oct 2013) [http://www.patientsfirst.org.uk/?p=806 The Life Cycle of the Whistleblower])&lt;/ref&gt; Where whistleblowers persist in raising their concerns, they increasingly risk detriments such as dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Public Concern at Work]] (2013) [http://www.pcaw.org.uk/files/Whistleblowing%20-%20the%20inside%20story%20FINAL.pdf Whistleblowing: The Inside Story - A study of the experiences of 100 whistleblowers] [[University of Greenwich]] research report&lt;/ref&gt;  Following dismissal, whistleblowers may struggle to find further employment due to damaged reputations, poor references and [[blacklisting]]. The social impact of whistleblowing through loss of livelihood (and sometimes pension), and family strain may also impact on whistleblowers’ psychological well being. Whistleblowers may also experience immense stress as a result of litigation regarding detriments such as unfair dismissal, which they often face with imperfect support or no support at all from unions. Whistleblowers who continue to pursue their concerns may also face long battles with official bodies such as regulators and government departments.&lt;ref name="Eye" /&gt;&lt;ref name="first" /&gt; Such bodies may reproduce the "institutional silence" by employers, adding to whistleblowers’ stress and difficulties.&lt;ref name="Parliament"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmpubacc/593/593.pdf Public Accounts Committee Report of Inquiry into Whistleblowing, Ninth Report of Session 2014–15])&lt;/ref&gt; In all, some whistleblowers suffer great injustice, that may never be acknowledged or rectified.&lt;ref name="Lennane2" /&gt; Such extreme experiences of threat and loss inevitably cause severe distress and sometimes mental illness, sometimes lasting for years afterwards. This mistreatment also deters others from coming forward with concerns. Thus, poor practices remain hidden behind a wall of silence, and prevent any organization from experiencing the improvements that may be afforded by intelligent failure.&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parliament" /&gt; Some whistleblowers who part ranks with their organizations have had their mental stability questioned, such as [[Adrian Schoolcraft]], the [[NYPD]] veteran who alleged falsified crime statistics in his department and was forcibly committed to a mental institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2010/10/cop-nypd-psych-ward-whistleblowing/|title=Cop hauled off to psych ward after alleging fake crime stats|website=www.rawstory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the emotional strain of a whistleblower investigation is devastating to the accused's family.&lt;ref name="tbo.com"/&gt;

=== Ethics ===
The definition of [[ethics]] is the [[moral]] [[principles]] that govern a person's or group's behavior. The ethical implications of whistleblowing can be negative as well as positive. However, sometimes employees may blow the whistle as an act of revenge. [[Rosemary O'Leary]] explains this in her short volume on a topic called [[guerrilla]] government. "Rather than acting openly, guerrillas often choose to remain "in the closet," moving clandestinely behind the scenes, salmon swimming upstream against the current of power. Over the years, I have learned that the motivations driving guerrillas are diverse. The reasons for acting range from the [[altruistic]] (doing the right thing) to the seemingly petty (I was passed over for that promotion). Taken as a whole, their acts are as awe inspiring as saving human lives out of a love of humanity and as trifling as slowing the issuance of a report out of spite or anger."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ethics of Dissent: Managing Guerrilla Government|last = O'Leary|first = Rosemary|publisher = CQ|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Washington D.C.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, of the more than 1,000 whistleblower complaints that are filed each year with the Pentagon's Inspector General, about 97 percent are not substantiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/04/25/commander-of-bin-laden-raid-blasts-senate-for-disrespecting-military-leaders/|title=Commander of bin Laden raid blasts Senate for disrespecting military leaders|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed throughout the professional world that an individual is bound to secrecy within their work sector. Discussions of whistleblowing and employee loyalty usually assume that the concept of loyalty is irrelevant to the issue or, more commonly, that whistleblowing involves a moral choice that pits the loyalty that an employee owes an employer against the employee's responsibility to serve the public interest.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblowing and Employee Loyalty|last = Larmer|first = Robert A.|date = Feb 1992|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert A. Larmer describes the standard view of whistleblowing in the [[Journal of Business Ethics]] by explaining that an employee possesses [[prima facie]] (based on the first impression; accepted as correct until proved otherwise) duties of loyalty and confidentiality to their employers and that whistleblowing cannot be justified except on the basis of a higher duty to the [[public good]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is important to recognize that in any relationship which demands loyalty the relationship works both ways and involves mutual enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblowing and Employee Loyalty|last = Duska|first = Ronald|date = Feb 1992|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics of Edward Snowden's actions have been widely discussed and debated in news media and academia worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Mark. "EDWARD SNOWDEN: HERO OR TRAITOR? CONSIDERING THE IMPLICATIONS FOR CANADIAN NATIONAL SECURITY AND WHISTLEBLOWER LAW".&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Snowden released [[Classified information|classified]] intelligence to the American people in an attempt to allow Americans to see the inner workings of the government. A person is diligently tasked with the [[wikt:conundrum|conundrum]] of choosing to be loyal to the company or to blow the whistle on the company's wrongdoing. Discussions on whistleblowing generally revolve around three topics: attempts to define whistleblowing more precisely, debates about whether and when whistleblowing is permissible, and debates about whether and when one has an obligation to blow the whistle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Issues in Business Ethics|last = |first = |publisher = Springer|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = 139–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motivations ===
Many whistleblowers have stated that they were motivated to take action to put an end to unethical practices, after witnessing injustices in their businesses or organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Alexander J. "Using Scholarship on Whistleblowing to Inform Peer Ethics Reporting". Professional Psychology: Research &amp; Practice. Aug2015, Vol. 46 Issue 4: p298–305. 8p.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study found that whistleblowers are often motivated to take action when they notice a sharp decline in ethical practices, as opposed to a gradual worsening.&lt;ref&gt;Gino, F., &amp; Bazerman, M. H. (2009). When misconduct goes unnoticed: The acceptability of gradual erosion in others' unethical behavior. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 45(4), 708-719.&lt;/ref&gt; There are generally two metrics by which whistleblowers determine if a practice is unethical. The first metric involves a violation of the organization's bylaws or written ethical policies. These violations allow individuals to concretize and rationalize blowing the whistle.&lt;ref&gt;Kaptein, Muel (2011). "From Inaction to External Whistleblowing: The Influence of the Ethical Culture of Organizations on Employee Responses to Observed Wrongdoing". Journal of Business Ethics. 98: 513.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, "value-driven" whistleblowers are influenced by their personal codes of ethics. In these cases, whistleblowers have been criticized for being driven by personal biases.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, J. P., &amp; McLain, D. A. (1992). Whistleblowing: A conceptualization and model. In Wall, J. L., &amp; Jauch, K. R. (Eds.), Academy of Management Best Papers Proceedings, August 10–12, Las Vegas, NV, 350–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ethics, social and organizational pressure are a motivating forces. A 2012 study identified that individuals are more likely to blow the whistle when several others know about the wrongdoing, because they would otherwise fear consequences for keeping silent.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, S. N., Robertson, J. C., &amp; Curtis, M. B. "The Effects of Contextual and Wrongdoing Attributes on Organizational Employees' Whistleblowing Intentions Following Fraud." Journal of Business Ethics. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In cases when one person is causing an injustice, the individual who notices the injustice may file a formal report, rather than confronting the wrongdoer, because confrontation would be more emotionally and psychologically stressful.&lt;ref&gt;de Graaf, Gjalt (2010).

==Legality of whistleblowing==
Legal protection for whistleblowing varies from country to country and may depend on the country of the original activity, where and how secrets were revealed, and how they eventually became published or publicized. Over a dozen countries have now adopted comprehensive whistleblower protection laws that create mechanisms for reporting wrongdoing and provide legal protections to whistleblowers. Over 50 countries have adopted more limited protections as part of their anti-corruption, freedom of information, or employment laws.&lt;ref&gt;Banisar, "Whistleblowing: International Standards and Developments", in CORRUPTION AND TRANSPARENCY: DEBATING THE FRONTIERS BETWEEN STATE, MARKET AND SOCIETY, I.

===Australia===
{{main article|Whistleblower protection in Australia}}
There are laws in a number of states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Whistleblowers Australia |url=http://www.whistleblowers.org.au/ |publisher=Whistleblowers.org.au }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former NSW Police Commissioner Tony Lauer summed up official government and police attitudes as: "Nobody in Australia much likes whistleblowers, particularly in an organization like the police or the government."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Caillier |first=J.G. |date=2015 |title=Transformational Leadership and Whistle-Blowing Attitudes Is This Relationship Mediated by Organizational Commitment and Public Service Motivation? |journal=The American Review of Public Administration |volume=45(4) |pages=458-475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Whistleblowers Australia]] is an association for those who have exposed corruption or any form of malpractice, especially if they were then hindered or abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Whistleblowers Australia |url=http://www.whistleblowers.org.au/ |title=Whistleblowers Australia |publisher=Whistleblowers.org.au |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner of Canada (PSIC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psic-ispc.gc.ca/|title=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner of Canada|first=Web Experience|last=Toolkit|website=www.psic-ispc.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a safe and confidential mechanism enabling public servants and the general public to disclose wrongdoings committed in the public sector. It also protects from reprisal public servants who have disclosed wrongdoing and those who have cooperated in investigations. The Office's goal is to enhance public confidence in Canada's federal public institutions and in the integrity of public servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|first1=PSIC|title=Background, Objectives, Scope|url=http://www.psic.gc.ca/eng/content/background-objectives-scope|publisher=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandated by the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act (The Act), PSIC is a permanent and independent Agent of Parliament. The Act, which came into force on April 15, 2007, applies to most of the federal public sector, approximately 400,000 public servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|first1=PSIC|title=The Servants Disclosure Protection Act|url=http://www.psic.gc.ca/eng/aboutus/psdpa|publisher=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes government departments and agencies, parent Crown corporations, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other federal public sector bodies.

Not all disclosures lead to an investigation as the Act sets out the jurisdiction of the Commissioner and gives the option not to investigate under certain circumstances. On the other hand, if PSIC conducts an investigation and finds no wrongdoing was committed, the Commissioner must report his findings to the discloser and to the organization's chief executive. Also, reports of founded wrongdoing are presented before the House of Commons and the Senate in accordance with The Act. As of June 2014, a total of 9 reports have been tabled in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|first1=PSIC|title=Case Reports|url=http://www.psic-ispc.gc.ca/eng/wrongdoing/casereports|publisher=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also established the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Tribunal (PSDPT) to protect public servants by hearing reprisal complaints referred by the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner. The Tribunal can grant remedies in favour of complainants and order disciplinary action against persons who take reprisals.

PSIC's current Commissioner is Mr. Mario Dion. Previously, he has served in various senior roles in the public service, including as Associate Deputy Minister of Justice, Executive Director and Deputy Head of the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada, and as Chair of the National Parole Board.

===European Union===

The [[European Parliament]] approved a "Whistleblower Protection Directive" containing broad [[free speech]] protections for whistleblowers in both the public and the private sectors, including for [[journalist]]s, in all member states of the [[European Union]]. The Directive prohibits direct or indirect retaliation against employees, current and former, in the public sector and the private sector. The Directive's protections apply to employees, to volunteers, and  to those who assist them, including to [[civil society]] organizations and to journalists who report on their evidence. It provides equal rights for whistleblowers in the national security sector who challenge denial or removal of their security clearances. Also, whistleblowers are protected from criminal prosecution and corporate lawsuits for damages resulting from their whistleblowing, and provides for psychological support for dealing with harassment stress.&lt;ref&gt;[[Government Accountability Project]], 21 Nov. 2018, "[https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2018/11/21/european-parliament-panel-approves-whistleblower-protections-all-eu-countries European Parliament Panel Approves Whistleblower Protections for all EU Countries]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Good government]] observers have hailed the EU directive as setting "the global standard for [[best practice]] rights protecting freedom of speech where it counts the most—challenging abuses of power that betray the [[public trust]]," according to the U.S.-based [[Government Accountability Project]]. They have noted, however, that ambiguities remain in the Directive regarding application in some areas, such as "duty speech," that is, when employees report the same information as part of a job assignment, for example, to a supervisor, instead of whistleblowing as formal [[dissent]]. In fact, duty speech is how the overwhelming majority of whistleblowing information gets communicated, and where the free flow of information is needed for proper functioning of organizations. However it is in response to such "duty speech" employee communication that the vast majority of retaliation against employees occurs. These observers have noted that the Directive must be understood as applying to protection against retaliation for such duty speech because without such an understanding the Directive will "miss the iceberg of what’s needed.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Government Accountability Project]], 21 Nov. 2018, "[https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2018/11/21/european-parliament-panel-approves-whistleblower-protections-all-eu-countries European Parliament Panel Approves Whistleblower Protections for all EU Countries]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jamaica===
In [[Jamaica]], the Protected Disclosures Act, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japarliament.gov.jm/attachments/341_The+Protected+Disclosures+Act,+2011.pdf|title=Acts List|first=Houses of|last=Parliament|website=www.japarliament.gov.jm}}&lt;/ref&gt; received assent in March 2011. It creates a comprehensive system for the protection of whistleblowers in the public and private sector. It is based on the [[Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998]].

===India===
{{main article|Whistleblower protection in India}}
The [[Government of India]] has been considering adopting a whistleblower protection law for several years. In 2003, the Law Commission of India recommended the adoption of the Public Interest Disclosure (Protection of Informers) Act, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/reports/179rptp2.pdf |title=Publin Interest Disclosure Bill |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, the Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010 was introduced into the [[Lok Sabha]], lower house of the [[Parliament of India]].&lt;ref&gt;The Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010 [http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/postoftheday/PIDPPMDBill-2010.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill was approved by the cabinet in June, 2011. The Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010 was renamed as The Whistleblowers' Protection Bill, 2011 by the Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/Public%20Disclosure/Legislative%20Brief%20-%20Public%20Interest%20Disclosure%20Bil.pdf |title=Legislative Brief |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Whistleblowers' Protection Bill, 2011 was passed by the Lok Sabha on 28 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=PTI |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2752946.ece |title=Whistle-blowers Bill passed |publisher=The Hindu |date=2011-12-28 |accessdate=2012-07-08 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Rajyasabha on 21 February 2014. The Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2011 has received the Presidential assent on May 9, 2014 and the same has been subsequently published in the official gazette of the Government of India on May 9, 2014 by the Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India.

===Ireland===
The government of [[Ireland]] committed to adopting a comprehensive whistleblower protection law in January 2012. The bill reportedly covers both the public and private sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Whistleblower Bill to cover public and private sectors |newspaper=Irish Times |date=30 January 2011 |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0130/1224310944604.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands has measures in place to mitigate the risks of whistleblowing: the whistleblower advice centre (Adviespunt Klokkenluiders) offers advice to whistleblowers, and the Parliament recently passed a proposal to establish a so-called house for whistleblowers, to protect them from the severe negative consequences that they might endure (Kamerstuk, 2013). Dutch media organizations also provide whistleblower support; on 9 September 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vanaf vandaag: anoniem lekken naar media via doorgeefluik Publeaks|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2694/Tech-Media/article/detail/3506349/2013/09/09/Vanaf-vandaag-anoniem-lekken-naar-media-via-doorgeefluik-Publeaks.dhtml|publisher=volkskrant.nl|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of major Dutch media outlets supported the launch of Publeaks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publeaks.nl|title=Publeaks - Veilig en anoniem informatie delen met de pers|website=www.publeaks.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which provides a secure website for people to leak documents to the media. Publeaks is designed to protect whistleblowers. It operates on the [[GlobaLeaks]] software developed by the Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://logioshermes.org|title=HERMES Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights|website=logioshermes.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which supports whistleblower-oriented technologies internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handling ethical problems in counterterrorism An inventory of methods to support ethical decisionmaking|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR200/RR251/RAND_RR251.pdf|publisher=RAND Corporation|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
The Swiss [[Council of States (Switzerland)|Council of States]] agreed on a draft amendment of the [[Swiss Code of Obligations]] in September 2014. The draft introduces articles 321a&lt;sup&gt;bis&lt;/sup&gt; to 321a&lt;sup&gt;septies&lt;/sup&gt;, 328(3), 336(2)(d).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schutz bei Meldung von Unregelmässigkeiten am Arbeitsplatz|url=http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/federal-gazette/2013/9589.pdf|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment of article 362(1) adds articles 321a&lt;sup&gt;bis&lt;/sup&gt; to 321a&lt;sup&gt;septies&lt;/sup&gt; to the list of provisions that may not be overruled by labour and bargaining agreements.&lt;br /&gt;
Article 321a&lt;sup&gt;ter&lt;/sup&gt; introduces an obligation on employees to report irregularities to their employer before reporting to an authority. An employee will, however, not breach his duty of good faith if he reports an irregularity to an authority and
* a period set by the employer and no longer than 60 days has lapsed since the employee has reported the incident to his employer, and
* the employer has not addressed the irregularity or it is obvious that the employer has insufficiently addressed the irregularity.
Article 321a&lt;sup&gt;quarter&lt;/sup&gt; provides that an employee may exceptionally directly report to an authority. Exceptions apply in cases
* where the employee is in a position to objectively demonstrate that a report to his employer will prove ineffective,
* where the employee has to anticipate dismissal,
* where the employee must assume that the competent authority will be hindered in investigating the irregularity, or
* where there is a direct and serious hazard to life, to health, to safety, or to the environment.
The draft does not improve on protection against dismissal for employees who report irregularities to their employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Botschaft über die Teilrevision des Obligationenrechts |url=http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/federal-gazette/2013/9513.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment does not provide for employees [[Anonymity|anonymously]] filing their observations of irregularities.

===United Kingdom===
Whistleblowing in the United Kingdom is subject to the [[Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998|Public Interest Disclosure Act]] (PIDA) 1998.

The [[Freedom to Speak Up Review]] set out 20 principles to bring about improvements to help whistleblowers in the [[National Health Service|NHS]], including:
* Culture of raising concerns&amp;nbsp;– to make raising issues a part of normal routine business of a well-led NHS organization.
* Culture free from bullying&amp;nbsp;– freedom of staff to speak out relies on staff being able to work in a culture which is free from bullying.
* Training&amp;nbsp;– every member of staff should receive training in their trust's approach to raising concerns and in receiving and acting on them.
* Support&amp;nbsp;– all NHS trusts should ensure there is a dedicated person to whom concerns can be easily reported and without formality, a "speak up guardian" .
* Support to find alternative employment in the NHS&amp;nbsp;– where a worker who has raised a concern cannot, as a result, continue their role, the NHS should help them seek an alternative job.

[[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]] produced a whistleblowing policy in November 2015 that all NHS organizations in England are obliged to follow.  It explicitly says that anyone bullying or acting against a whistleblower could be potentially liable to disciplinary action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monitor to reveal national whistleblowing policy|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/workforce/exclusive-monitor-to-reveal-national-whistleblowing-policy/7000188.article|accessdate=18 December 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Whistleblower protection in the United States}}
Whistleblowing tradition in the United States started with [[Benjamin Franklin]] leaking a [[Hutchinson Letters Affair|few letters Hutchinson had written to Thomas Whately]], resulting in the [[American Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- Strike this entire sentence.  Franklin leaked these letters in 1773, 16 years before the "United States" was incorporated under the ratified Constitution in 1789.  There's no way to support that Franklin "started" the "tradition" of leaking embarrassing information.  Probably more accurate to attribute that honor to John Peter Zenger, but again, we're talking about the tradition within the British empire.  Also, there are dozens of "causes" of the American Revolution.  I have never heard of anyone citing the Hutchinson letter affair as one of them.    --&gt;

To be considered a whistleblower in the [[United States]], most federal whistleblower statutes require that [[federal employee]]s have reason to believe their employer violated some law, rule, or regulation; testify or commence a legal proceeding on the legally protected matter; or refuse to violate the law.

In cases where whistleblowing on a specified topic is protected by statute, U.S. courts have generally held that such whistleblowers are protected from retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oalj.dol.gov/PUBLIC/WHISTLEBLOWER/REFERENCES/REFERENCE_WORKS/EDIG12.HTM |title=DOL.gov |publisher=Oalj.dol.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a closely divided [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision, ''[[Garcetti v. Ceballos]]'' (2006) held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] [[free speech]] guarantees for government employees do not protect disclosures made within the scope of the employees' duties.

In the United States, legal protections vary according to the subject matter of the whistleblowing, and sometimes the state where the case arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peer.org/state/index.php |title=Peer.org |publisher=Peer.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In passing the 2002 [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]], the Senate Judiciary Committee found that whistleblower protections were dependent on the "patchwork and vagaries" of varying state statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record p. S7412; S. Rep. No. 107–146, 107th Cong., 2d Session 19 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Still, a wide variety of federal and state laws protect employees who call attention to violations, help with enforcement proceedings, or refuse to obey unlawful directions. While this patchwork approach has often been criticized, it also responsible for the United States having more dedicated whistleblowing laws than any other country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transatlantic Whistleblowing.|last = Gerdemann|first = Simon|publisher = Mohr Siebeck|year = 2018|isbn = 978-3-16-155917-4|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first US law adopted specifically to protect whistleblowers was the 1863 United States [[False Claims Act]] (revised in 1986), which tried to combat fraud by suppliers of the United States government during the [[American Civil War]]. The Act encourages whistleblowers by promising them a percentage of the money recovered by the government and by protecting them from employment retaliation.&lt;ref name="answers1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/whistleblower |title=Answers.com |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another US law that specifically protects whistleblowers is the [[Lloyd–La Follette Act]] of 1912. It guaranteed the right of federal employees to furnish information to the [[United States Congress]]. The first US environmental law to include an employee protection was the [[Clean Water Act]] of 1972. Similar protections were included in subsequent federal environmental laws, including the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (1974), [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (1976), [[Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976]], [[Energy Reorganization Act of 1974]] (through 1978 amendment to protect nuclear whistleblowers), [[Superfund|Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or the Superfund Law)]] (1980), and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] (1990). Similar employee protections enforced through OSHA are included in the [[Surface Transportation Assistance Act]] (1982) to protect truck drivers, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act (PSIA) of 2002, the [[Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century]] ("AIR 21"), and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, enacted on July 30, 2002 (for corporate fraud whistleblowers).

Investigation of retaliation against whistleblowers under 20 federal statutes falls under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Whistleblower Protection Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whistleblowers.gov |title=Whistleblowers.gov |publisher=Whistleblowers.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States Department of Labor|United States Department of Labor's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov |title=DOL.gov |publisher=DOL.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov |title=Osha.gov |publisher=Osha.gov |date=2012-04-28 |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; New whistleblower statutes enacted by Congress, which are to be enforced by the Secretary of Labor, are generally delegated by a Secretary's Order&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER&amp;p_id=21749 |title=Osha.gov |publisher=Osha.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to OSHA's Office of the Whistleblower Protection Program (OWPP).

The patchwork of laws means that victims of retaliation need to be aware of the laws at issue to determine the deadlines and means for making proper complaints. Some deadlines are as short as 10 days (Arizona State Employees have 10 days to file a "Prohibited Personnel Practice" Complaint before the Arizona State Personnel Board), while others are up to 300 days.

Those who report a false claim against the federal government, and suffer adverse employment actions as a result, may have up to six years (depending on state law) to file a civil suit for remedies under the US [[False Claims Act]] (FCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|31|3730}} (h)&lt;/ref&gt; Under a ''[[qui tam]]'' provision, the "original source" for the report may be entitled to a percentage of what the government recovers from the offenders. However, the "original source" must also be the first to file a federal civil complaint for recovery of the federal funds fraudulently obtained, and must avoid publicizing the claim of fraud until the [[United States Department of Justice|US Justice Department]] decides whether to prosecute the claim itself. Such ''qui tam'' lawsuits must be filed under seal, using special procedures to keep the claim from becoming public until the federal government makes its decision on direct prosecution.

The federally recognized [[National Whistleblower Appreciation Day]] is observed annually on July 30, on the anniversary of the country's original 1778 whistleblower protection law.

===Other countries===
There are comprehensive laws in [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]]. A number of other countries have recently adopted comprehensive whistleblower laws including [[Ghana]], [[South Korea]], and [[Uganda]]. They are also being considered in [[Kenya]] and [[Rwanda]]. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in 2008 that whistleblowing was protected as freedom of expression. And in February 2017, [[Nigeria]] also set up the whistleblowing policy against corruption and other ills in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Guja v. Moldova, Application no. 14277/04 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy for whistleblower rights and protections==
Many [[NGOs]] advocate for stronger and more comprehensive legal rights and protections for whistleblowers. Among them are the [[Government Accountability Project]] (GAP), Blueprint for Free Speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blueprintforfreespeech.net/|title=Blueprint for Free Speech – Meet the whistleblowers|website=blueprintforfreespeech.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public Concern at Work]] (PCaW) and the Open Democracy Advice Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.org.za/|title=Home|first=Super|last=User|website=www.opendemocracy.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern methods used for whistleblower protection ==
Whistleblowers that may be at risk of those they are exposing are now using [[encryption]] methods and anonymous content sharing software to protect their identity.
