'''Alexithymia''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|l|ɛ|k|s|ə|ˈ|θ|aɪ|m|i|ə}} is a personality construct characterized by the [[Wikt:subclinical|subclinical]] inability to identify and describe emotions in the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sifneos PE | year = 1973 | title = The prevalence of 'alexithymic' characteristics in psychosomatic patients | url = | journal = Psychotherapy and psychosomatics | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 255–262 | doi=10.1159/000286529 | pmid=4770536}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core characteristics of alexithymia are marked dysfunction in emotional awareness, social attachment, and interpersonal relating.&lt;ref name = "Feldman"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=FeldmanHall O, Dalgleish T, Mobbs D | year = 2013| title = Alexithymia decreases altruism in real social decisions | url = | journal = Cortex | volume =  49| issue = | pages =  899–904| doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2012.10.015 | pmid=23245426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, people with alexithymia have difficulty in distinguishing and appreciating the emotions of others, which is thought to lead to [[Empathy|unempathic]] and ineffective emotional responding.&lt;ref name="Feldman" /&gt; Alexithymia occurs in approximately 10% of the population and can occur with a number of psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor GJ, Bagby, M.R., Parker, J.D.A.

==Lexicology==
The term ''alexithymia'' was coined by psychotherapists [[John Case Nemiah]] and Peter Sifneos in 1973.&lt;ref name="Duden Medizin"&gt;Stichwort ''Alexi|thymie''. In: ''[[Duden]]. Das Wörterbuch medizinischer Fachausdrücke. Software für PC-Bibliothek.'' Bibliographisches Institut, Mannheim&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bar-On&gt;{{cite book |last=Bar-On |first=Reuven |author2=Parker, James DA |year=2000 |title=The Handbook of Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Development, Assessment, and Application at Home, School, and in the Workplace |location=San Francisco, California |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=0-7879-4984-1}} pp. 40–59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2831&gt;Taylor GJ &amp; Taylor HS (1997). Alexithymia. In M. McCallum &amp; W.E. Piper (Eds.) ''Psychological mindedness: A contemporary understanding''. Munich: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates pp. 28–31&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀ-}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|a-}}, 'not') + {{lang|grc|λέξις}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|léxis}}, 'words') + {{lang|grc|θῡμός}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|thȳmós}}, 'heart' or 'emotions'),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/alexithymic|title=alexithymic - definition of alexithymic in English |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |access-date=11 October 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011225303/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/alexithymic |archivedate=11 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; literally meaning "no words for emotions".&lt;ref name="Duden Medizin"/&gt;

Nonmedical terms describing similar conditions include emotionless and impassive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nicholls MER ''et al.'' | year = 1999 | title = Laterality of expression in portraiture: putting your best cheek forward | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences | volume = 266 | issue = 1428| pages = 1517–1522 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0809| pmc = 1690171}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with the condition are called alexithymics or alexithymiacs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mark A | year = 2005 | title = Organizing emotions in health care | url = | journal = Journal of Health Organization and Management | volume = 19 | issue = 4/5| pages = 277–289 | doi=10.1108/14777260510615332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Alexithymia is considered to be a [[personality trait]] that places affected individuals at risk for other medical and psychiatric disorders while reducing the likelihood that these individuals will respond to conventional treatments for the other conditions.&lt;ref name=Haviland&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haviland MG, Warren WL, Riggs ML |title=An observer scale to measure alexithymia |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=385–92 |year=2000 |pmid=11015624 |url=http://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/41/5/385#R26732 |accessdate=2007-08-10 |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.41.5.385}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexithymia is not classified as a mental disorder in the  [[DSM-IV|fourth edition of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'']]. It is a dimensional personality trait that varies in severity from person to person. A person's alexithymia score can be measured with questionnaires such as the [[Toronto Alexithymia Scale]] (TAS-20), the [[Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire]] (BVAQ),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vorst HC, Bermond B | year = 2001 | title = Validity and reliability of the Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 413–434 | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00033-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Online Alexithymia Questionnaire (OAQ-G2)&lt;ref name="revneurol.org"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Paula-Perez I | date = Mar 2010 | title = Alexitimia y sindrome de Asperger | url = http://www.revneurol.org/sec/resumen.php?or=web&amp;i=e&amp;id=2009770&amp;vol=50&amp;num=S03 | journal = Rev Neurol | volume = 50 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = S85–90 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727213524/http://www.revneurol.org/sec/resumen.php?or=web&amp;i=e&amp;id=2009770&amp;vol=50&amp;num=S03 | archivedate = 2011-07-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Observer Alexithymia Scale (OAS).&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;  It is distinct from the psychiatric personality disorders, such as [[antisocial personality disorder]] or [[borderline personality disorder]], with which it shares some characteristics, and is likewise distinct from the abnormal conditions of [[sociopathy]] or [[psychopathy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Alexithymia is defined by:&lt;ref name=Taylor29&gt;Taylor (1997), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;
# difficulty identifying feelings and distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal
# difficulty describing feelings to other people
# constricted imaginal processes, as evidenced by a scarcity of fantasies
# a stimulus-bound, externally oriented cognitive style.

In studies of the general population the degree of alexithymia was found to be influenced by age{{How|date=October 2018}}, but not by gender; the rates of alexithymia in healthy controls have been found at: 8.3%; 4.7%; 8.9%; and 7%. Thus, several studies have reported that the prevalence rate of alexithymia is less than 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fukunishi I, Berger D, Wogan J, Kuboki T |title=Alexithymic traits as predictors of difficulties with adjustment in an outpatient cohort of expatriates in Tokyo |journal=Psychological Reports |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=67–77 |year=1999 |pmid=10575975 |url=http://www.japanpsychiatrist.com/Abstracts/Expats1.html |accessdate=2007-08-10 |doi=10.2466/PR0.85.5.67-77 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812013705/http://www.japanpsychiatrist.com/Abstracts/Expats1.html |archivedate=2007-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A less common finding suggests that there may be a higher prevalence of alexithymia amongst males than females, which may be accounted for by difficulties some males have with "describing feelings", but not by difficulties in "identifying feelings" in which males and females show similar abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salminen JK, Saarijärvi S, Aärelä E, Toikka T, Kauhanen J |title=Prevalence of alexithymia and its association with sociodemographic variables in the general population of Finland |journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=75–82 |year=1999 |pmid=10088984 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3999(98)00053-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Psychologist [[R. Michael Bagby]] and psychiatrist Graeme J. Taylor have argued that the alexithymia construct is strongly related (negatively) to the concepts of [[psychological mindedness]]&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Taylor (1997), pp. 77–104&lt;/ref&gt; and emotional intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1997), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00014-3 | last1 = Parker | first1 = JDA | last2 = Taylor | first2 = GJ | last3 = Bagby | first3 = RM | year = 2001 | title = The Relationship Between Emotional Intelligence and Alexithymia | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 107–115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is "strong empirical support for alexithymia being a stable personality [[trait theory|trait]] rather than just a consequence of psychological distress".&lt;ref name="Taylor 1997, p. 37"&gt;Taylor (1997), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Other opinions differ and can show evidence that it may be state-dependent.&lt;ref name=Honkalampi&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Honkalampi K, Hintikka J, Laukkanen E, Lehtonen J, Viinamäki H |title=Alexithymia and depression: a prospective study of patients with major depressive disorder |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=229–34 |year=2001 |pmid=11351111 |url=http://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/42/3/229 |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.42.3.229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagby and Taylor also suggest that there may be two kinds of alexithymia, "primary alexithymia" which is an enduring psychological trait that does not alter over time, and "secondary alexithymia" which is state-dependent and disappears after the evoking stressful situation has changed. These two manifestations of alexithymia are otherwise called "trait" or "state" alexithymia.&lt;ref name="Taylor 1997, p. 37"/&gt;

==Description==
Typical deficiencies may include problems identifying, processing, describing, and working with one's own [[feeling]]s, often marked by a lack of understanding of the feelings of others; difficulty distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal;&lt;ref name=Bar-On/&gt; confusion of physical sensations often associated with emotions; few [[dream]]s or [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] due to restricted [[imagination]]; and concrete, realistic, [[logic]]al thinking, often to the exclusion of emotional responses to problems. Those who have alexithymia also report very logical and realistic dreams, such as going to the store or eating a meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krystal H |title= Alexithymia and psychotherapy |journal=American journal of psychotherapy |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=17–31 |year=1979 |pmid=464164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical experience suggests it is the structural features of [[dream]]s more than the ability to recall them that best characterizes alexithymia.&lt;ref name=Bar-On/&gt;

Some alexithymic individuals may appear to contradict the above-mentioned characteristics because they can experience chronic [[dysphoria]] or manifest outbursts of crying or rage.&lt;ref&gt;Nemiah et al. (1970), pp. 432–33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krystal (1988), p. 246; McDougall (1985), pp. 169–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1997), pp. 29, 246–47&lt;/ref&gt; However, questioning usually reveals that they are quite incapable of describing their feelings or appear confused by questions inquiring about specifics of feelings.&lt;ref name=Taylor29/&gt;

According to Henry Krystal, individuals suffering from alexithymia think in an operative way and may appear to be superadjusted to reality. In psychotherapy, however, a cognitive disturbance becomes apparent as patients tend to recount trivial, chronologically ordered actions, reactions, and events of daily life with monotonous detail.&lt;ref&gt;Krystal (1988) pp. 246-247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nemiah | first1 = CJ | year = 1978 | title = Alexithymia and Psychosomatic Illness | url = | journal = Journal of Continuing Education | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 25–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these individuals lack [[imagination]], intuition, [[empathy]], and drive-fulfillment fantasy{{clarify|date=April 2015}}, especially in relation to objects. Instead, they seem oriented toward things and even treat themselves as robots. These problems seriously limit their responsiveness to psychoanalytic psychotherapy; psychosomatic illness or substance abuse is frequently exacerbated should these individuals enter psychotherapy.&lt;ref name=Taylor29/&gt;

A common misconception about alexithymia is that affected individuals are totally unable to express emotions verbally and that they may even fail to acknowledge that they experience emotions. Even before coining the term, Sifneos (1967) noted patients often mentioned things like anxiety or depression. The distinguishing factor was their inability to elaborate beyond a few limited adjectives such as "happy" or "unhappy" when describing these feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sifneos | first1 = PE | year = 1967 | title = Clinical Observations on some patients suffering from a variety of psychosomatic diseases | url = | journal = Acta Medicina Psychosomatica | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 1–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The core issue is that people with alexithymia have poorly differentiated emotions limiting their ability to distinguish and describe them to others.&lt;ref name=Bar-On/&gt; This contributes to the sense of emotional detachment from themselves and difficulty connecting with others, making alexithymia negatively associated with [[life satisfaction]] even when depression and other confounding factors are controlled for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattila AK, Poutanen O, Koivisto AM, Salokangas RK, Joukamaa M | year = 2007| title = Alexithymia and Life Satisfaction in Primary Healthcare Patients | url = | journal = Psychosomatics | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 523–529 | doi=10.1176/appi.psy.48.6.523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
It is unclear what causes alexithymia, though several theories have been proposed.

Early studies showed evidence that there may be an interhemispheric transfer deficit among people with alexithymia; that is, the emotional information from the right hemisphere of the brain is not being properly transferred to the language regions in the left hemisphere, as can be caused by a decreased [[corpus callosum]], often present in psychiatric patients who have suffered severe childhood abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoppe KD, Bogen JE |title=Alexithymia in twelve commissurotomized patients |journal=Psychotherapy and psychosomatics |volume=28 |issue=1–4 |pages=148–55 |year=1977 |pmid=609675 |doi=10.1159/000287057}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] study in 1997 indicated that alexithymia may be due to a disturbance to the right hemisphere of the [[Human brain|brain]], which is largely responsible for processing emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jessimer M, Markham R |title=Alexithymia: a right hemisphere dysfunction specific to recognition of certain facial expressions? |journal=Brain and cognition |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=246–58 |year=1997 |pmid=9220088 |doi=10.1006/brcg.1997.0900}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, another neuropsychological model suggests that alexithymia may be related to a dysfunction of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lane RD, Ahern GL, Schwartz GE, Kaszniak AW |title=Is alexithymia the emotional equivalent of blindsight? |journal=Biol. Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=834–44 |year=1997 |pmid=9347133 |doi= 10.1016/S0006-3223(97)00050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have some shortcomings, however, and the empirical evidence about the neural mechanisms behind alexithymia remains inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tabibnia G, Zaidel E |title=Alexithymia, interhemispheric transfer, and right hemispheric specialization: a critical review |journal=Psychotherapy and psychosomatics |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=81–92 |year=2005 |pmid=15741757 |doi=10.1159/000083166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French psychoanalyst [[Joyce McDougall]] objected to the strong focus by clinicians on neurophysiological at the expense of psychological explanations for the genesis and operation of alexithymia, and introduced the alternative term "[[disaffectation]]" to stand for psychogenic alexithymia.&lt;ref&gt;McDougall (1989), pp. 93, 103&lt;/ref&gt; For McDougall, the disaffected individual had at some point "experienced overwhelming emotion that threatened to attack their sense of integrity and identity", to which they applied psychological defenses to pulverize and eject all emotional representations from consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;McDougall (1989), pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar line of interpretation has been taken up using the methods of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maclaren K |title=Emotional Disorder and the Mind-Body Problem: A Case Study of Alexithymia |journal=Chiasmi International |volume=8 |pages=139–55 |year=2006 |doi=10.5840/chiasmi2006819}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDougall has also noted that all infants are born unable to identify, organize, and speak about their emotional experiences (the word ''infans'' is from the Latin "not speaking"), and are "by reason of their immaturity inevitably alexithymic".&lt;ref name=McDougall161&gt;McDougall (1985), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this fact McDougall proposed in 1985 that the alexithymic part of an adult personality could be "an extremely arrested and infantile psychic structure".&lt;ref name=McDougall161/&gt; The first language of an infant is nonverbal facial expressions. The parent's emotional state is important for determining how any child might develop. Neglect or indifference to varying changes in a child's facial expressions without proper feedback can promote an invalidation of the facial expressions manifested by the child. The parent's ability to reflect self-awareness to the child is another important factor. If the adult is incapable of recognizing and distinguishing emotional expressions in the child, it can influence the child's capacity to understand emotional expressions.

[[Molecular genetics|Molecular genetic]] research into alexithymia remains minimal, but promising candidates have been identified from studies examining connections between certain genes and alexithymia among those with psychiatric conditions as well as the general population. A study recruiting a test population of Japanese males found higher scores on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale among those with the [[5-HTTLPR]] homozygous long (L) allele. The 5-HTTLPR region on the [[serotonin transporter]] gene influences the transcription of the seretonin transporter that removes serotonin from the [[synaptic cleft]], and is well studied for its association with numerous psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kano|first1=Michiko|last2=Mizuno|first2=Tomoko|last3=Kawano|first3=Yuko|last4=Aoki|first4=Masashi|last5=Kanazawa|first5=Motoyori|last6=Fukudo|first6=Shin|title=Serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphism and alexithymia|journal=Neuropsychobiology|date=1 January 2012|volume=65|issue=2|pages=76–82|doi=10.1159/000329554|pmid=22222552|issn=1423-0224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study examining the [[5-HT1A receptor]], a receptor that binds [[serotonin]], found higher levels of alexithymia among those with the G allele of the Rs6295 [[Gene polymorphism|polymorphism]] within the HTR1A gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gong|first1=Pingyuan|last2=Liu|first2=Jinting|last3=Li|first3=She|last4=Zhou|first4=Xiaolin|title=Serotonin receptor gene (5-HT1A) modulates alexithymic characteristics and attachment orientation|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|date=1 December 2014|volume=50|pages=274–279|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.09.001|pmid=25247748|issn=1873-3360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a study examining alexithymia in subjects with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] found higher alexithymia levels associated with the Val/Val allele of the [[Rs4680]] polymorphism in the gene that encodes [[Catechol-O-methyltransferase]] (COMT), an enzyme which degrades [[catecholamine]] neurotransmitters such as [[dopamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koh|first1=Min Jung|last2=Kang|first2=Jee In|last3=Namkoong|first3=Kee|last4=Lee|first4=Su Young|last5=Kim|first5=Se Joo|title=Association between the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) Val¹⁵⁸Met Polymorphism and Alexithymia in Patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|journal=Yonsei Medical Journal|date=1 May 2016|volume=57|issue=3|pages=721–727|doi=10.3349/ymj.2016.57.3.721|pmid=26996573|issn=1976-2437|pmc=4800363}}&lt;/ref&gt; These links are tentative, and further research will be needed to clarify how these genes relate to the neurological anomalies found in the brains of people with alexithymia.

Although there is evidence for the role of environmental and neurological factors, the role and influence of genetic factors for developing alexithymia is still unclear.&lt;ref name= ReferenceA&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jørgensen MM, Zachariae R, Skytthe A, Kyvik K | year = 2007 | title = Genetic and Environmental Factors in Alexithymia: A Population-Based Study of 8,785 Danish Twin Pairs | url = | journal = Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics | volume = 76 | issue = | pages = 369–375 | doi = 10.1159/000107565 | pmid = 17917473 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A single large scale Danish study suggested that genetic factors contributed noticeably to the development of alexithymia.

==In relationships==
Alexithymia creates interpersonal problems because these individuals tend to avoid emotionally close relationships, or if they do form relationships with others they usually position themselves as either dependent, dominant, or impersonal, "such that the relationship remains superficial".&lt;ref name=Vanheule&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanheule S, Desmet M, Meganck R, Bogaerts S |title=Alexithymia and interpersonal problems |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages= 109–17 |year=2007 |pmid=17016830 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inadequate "differentiation" between self and others by alexithymic individuals has also been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blaustein JP, Tuber SB | year = 1998 | title = Knowing the Unspeakable | url = | journal = Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 351–365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1997) pp. 26-46&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study, a large group of alexithymic individuals completed the 64-item Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-64) which found that "two interpersonal problems are significantly and stably related to alexithymia: cold/distant and non-assertive social functioning. All other IIP-64 subscales were not significantly related to alexithymia."&lt;ref name=Vanheule/&gt;

Chaotic interpersonal relations have also been observed by Sifneos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sifneos PE |title=Alexithymia: past and present |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=153 |issue=7 Suppl |pages=137–42 |year=1996 |pmid=8659637 |doi=10.1176/ajp.153.7.137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the inherent difficulties identifying and describing emotional states in self and others, alexithymia also negatively affects relationship satisfaction between couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yelsma P, Marrow S |title=An Examination of Couples' Difficulties With Emotional Expressiveness and Their Marital Satisfaction |journal=Journal of Family Communication |year=2003 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=41–62 |doi=10.1207/S15327698JFC0301_03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 study&lt;ref name="Colin Hesse 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hesse Colin |author2=Floyd Kory | year = 2008 | title = Affectionate experience mediates the effects of alexithymia on mental health and interpersonal relationships | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 793–810 | doi = 10.1177/0265407508096696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; alexithymia was found to be correlated with impaired understanding and demonstration of relational affection, and that this impairment contributes to poorer mental health, poorer relational well-being, and lowered relationship quality.&lt;ref name="Colin Hesse 2008"/&gt; Individuals high on the alexithymia spectrum also report less distress at seeing others in pain and behave less altruistically toward others.&lt;ref name = Feldman /&gt;

Some individuals working for organizations in which control of emotions is the norm might show alexithymic-like behavior but not be alexithymic. However, over time the lack of self-expressions can become routine and they may find it harder to identify with others.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries (2001) "Struggling with the Demon: Perspectives on Individual and Organizational Irrationality"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comorbidities==
Alexithymia frequently co-occurs with other disorders. Research indicates that alexithymia overlaps with [[autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD).&lt;ref name="revneurol.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shah|first=Punit|last2=Hall|first2=Richard|last3=Catmur|first3=Caroline|last4=Bird|first4=Geoffrey|date=2016-08-01|title=Alexithymia, not autism, is associated with impaired interoception|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945216300594|journal=Cortex|volume=81|pages=215–220|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2016.03.021|pmc=4962768|pmid=27253723}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Hill&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hill E, Berthoz S, Frith U |year=2004 |title=Brief report: cognitive processing of own emotions in individuals with autistic spectrum disorder and in their relatives |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=229–235 |doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000022613.41399.14 |pmid=15162941}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2004 study using the TAS-20,  85% of the adults with ASD fell into the impaired category; almost half of the whole group fell into the severely impaired category.

There are many more psychiatric disorders that overlap with alexithymia. One study found that 41%  of [[Vietnam War]] veterans with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] ([[PTSD]]) were alexithymic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shipko S, Alvarez WA, Noviello N |title=Towards a teleological model of alexithymia: alexithymia and post-traumatic stress disorder |journal=Psychotherapy and psychosomatics |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=122–6 |year=1983 |pmid=6878595 |doi=10.1159/000287730}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found higher levels of alexithymia among Holocaust survivors with PTSD compared to those without.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yehuda R, Steiner A, Kahana B, Binder-Brynes K, Southwick SM, Zemelman S, Giller EL | year = 1997 | title = Alexithymia in Holocaust survivors with and without PTSD | url = | journal = J Trauma Stress | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 83–100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher levels of alexithymia among mothers with interpersonal violence-related PTSD were found in one study to have proportionally less caregiving sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schechter DS, Suardi F, Manini A, Cordero MI, Sancho Rossignol A, Gex-Fabry Merminod G, Moser DA, Rusconi Serpa S | year = | title = How do maternal PTSD and alexithymia interact to impact maternal behaviour? | url = | journal = Child Psychiatry and Human Development | volume = | issue = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter study suggested that when treating adult PTSD patients who are parents, alexithymia should be assessed and addressed also with attention to the parent-child relationship and the child's social-emotional development.

'''Amoha''' (Sanskrit, Pali; Tibetan Wylie: ''gti mug med pa'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "non-delusion"  or "non-bewilderment". It is defined as being without delusion concerning what is true, due to discrimination; its function is to cause one to not engage in unwholesome actions.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 542-544.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the [[Abhidharma]] teachings. 

The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is non-deludedness? It is a thorough comprehension of (practical) knowledge that comes from maturation, instructions, thinking and understanding, and its function is to provide a basis for not becoming involved in evil behavior.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

[[Herbert Guenther]] states:
: It is a distinct discriminatory awareness to counteract the deludedness that has its cause in either what one has been born into or what one has acquired.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3042">In Hindu theology, '''Arishadvarga''' are the six enemies&lt;ref&gt;Shankaracharyar Granthabali, Basumati publication (Kolkata: 1995), Volume 3&lt;/ref&gt; of the mind, which are: ''[[kama]]'' (lust), ''krodha''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/krodha&lt;/ref&gt; (anger), ''[[lobha]]'' (greed), ''moha''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/moha&lt;/ref&gt; (attachment), ''[[mada]]'' (pride), and ''matsarya''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/matsarya&lt;/ref&gt; (jealousy);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 69|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; the negative characteristics of which prevent man from attaining ''[[moksha]]'' or salvation. 

These are the fundamental tenets of [[Kali Yuga]]. The more each individual fights them, the longer will be the life of ''[[Dharma]]'' in this yuga.

#''[[kama]]''                  — lust
#''krodha''                    — anger
#''[[lobha]]''                 — greed
#''moha''                      — delusory emotional attachment or temptation 
#''[[mada]]''  — pride, hubris, (being possessed by) 
#''matsarya''                  — envy, jealousy

According to the Hindu scriptures, ''kama'' and ''krodha'' (lust and anger) are responsible for all kinds of difficult experiences we face in our lives.

With ''mada'' or ''ahankar'', the false ego up and active, all our actions in the world are for selfish ends. Hence there is no other factor causing the illusory duality of differentiation between 'us' and 'them' and the repeated pain and delusion it entails than the psychological ego-sense. When the materially identified ego has sided with the materialistic forces of creation ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]), it is said to have the following faults: ''kama'', ''krodha'', ''lobha'', ''moha'', ''mada'' and ''matsarya''. Also called evil passions, man's spiritual heritage constantly gets looted by these internal thieves (and their numerous variations), causing him to lose knowledge of his True Being.

If a person is virtually a prisoner of ''arishadvargas'' (the six internal enemies), then his life is completely governed by destiny. As a person moves ahead on the path of Self-Realization, the grip of destiny over him loosens and he gets more and more leverage to change his destiny. When a person identifies himself with the Self, then he becomes part of the power of destiny. Merely his power of ''[[Sankalpa]]'' is good enough to materialize and change any situation either for good or bad according to his ''sankalpa''.

Through ''[[bhakti]]'' and renunciation, these 6 vices can be overcome. The great [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] Saint [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] exhorted, "''Krishna Nama Sankirtan''" i.e. the constant chanting of the Lord's name is the supreme healer in [[Kali Yuga]]. It destroys sins and purifies the hearts through ''Bhakti'' and ensures universal peace.

It has been abolished in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and in [[South Australia]], but replaced with a similar offence.

==Australia==

Anything interfering with the health or comfort of victim which is more than merely transient or trifling has been held by Australian courts to be "actual bodily harm".
&lt;ref&gt;''R v Donovan'' [1934] 2 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 498; [http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/cases/NZPoliceLawRp/1934/8.pdf (1934) 5 New Zealand Police Law Reports 247]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|305|2009|litigants=R v McIntyre |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian Capital Territory ===

The offence is created by section 24(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|ACT|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|24}} Assault occasioning actual bodily harm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/1900-40/current/pdf/1900-40.pdf|title=Crimes Act 1900 A1900-40 Republication No 107|last=ACT Parliamentary Counsel|first=|date=1 September 2016|publisher=Australian Capital Territory|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Australia ===

Assault occasioning actual bodily harm was formerly an offence under section 40 of the [[Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935]], but has been abolished and replaced with a similar offence (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/CRIMINAL%20LAW%20CONSOLIDATION%20ACT%201935/CURRENT/1935.2252.UN.PDF|title=South Australia Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legislation.sa.gov.au|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==
The offence is created by section 39 of the [[Offences against the Person Ordinance]]. It is triable on [[indictment]] and a person guilty of it is liable to imprisonment for three years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Offences against the Person Ordinance]] [http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/212/s39.html section 39]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republic of Ireland==

The common law offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm was abolished,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997]], section 28(1)(b) [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/sec0028.html#zza26y1997s28]&lt;/ref&gt; and section 47 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] was repealed,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997]], section 31 [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/sec0031.html#zza26y1997s31] and Schedule [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/gen_1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; on a date three months after 19 May 1997.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997]], [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/sec0032.html#zza26y1997s32 section 32(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solomon Islands==

The offence is created by section 245 of the Penal Code (Ch.26).&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.paclii.org/sb/legis/consol_act/pc66/&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{see also|Non-fatal offences against the person in English law}}

===The offence===

In England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland, the offence is created by section 47 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]:

{{cquote|47. Whosoever shall be convicted upon an indictment of any assault occasioning actual bodily harm shall be liable ... to be kept in penal servitude ...; ... ...}}

The words "at the discretion of the court" omitted in the first place, and the words "for the term of three years, or to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years, with or without hard labour" omitted in the second place, were repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1892]].

The words from "and" to the end, omitted in the third place, were repealed for England and Wales by section 170(2) of, and Schedule 16 to, the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]] (subject to section 123(6) of, and paragraph 16 of Schedule 8 to, that Act).

The words "with or without hard labour" at the end were repealed for England and Wales by section 1(2) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]].

The text of this section is slightly different in Northern Ireland.

====Assault====
The expression assault includes "[[Battery (crime)|battery]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 2009 edition, at paragraph 19-195. Thomson/Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' was decided under section 51 of the [[Police Act 1964]], which also used the word "assault" without further explanation and without any explicit reference to battery. James J. said:

{{Blockquote|An assault is any act which intentionally—or possibly recklessly—causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. Although "assault" is an independent crime and is to be treated as such, for practical purposes today "assault" is generally synonymous with the term "battery" and is a term used to mean the actual intended use of unlawful force to another person without his consent. On the facts of the present case the "assault" alleged involved a "battery."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' [1969] 1 QB 439 at 444D to E, [1968] 3 All ER 442 at 445&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''R v Williams (Gladstone)'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1983/4.html R v Williams (Gladstone)]'', (1983) 78 Cr App R 276, [1984] Crim LR 163, [[Court of Appeal|CA]] (28 November 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant was prosecuted for this offence. [[Lord Lane]] said:

{{Blockquote|"Assault" in the context of this case, that is to say using the word as a convenient abbreviation for assault and battery, is an act by which the defendant, intentionally or recklessly, applies unlawful force to the complainant.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1983/4.html R v Williams (Gladstone)]'', (1983) 78 Cr App R 276 at 279, [[Court of Appeal|CA]] (28 November 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''R v Burstow, R v Ireland'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/34.html R v Ireland, R v Burstow]'' [1998] 1 Cr App Rep 177, [1997] 3 WLR 534, [1998] AC 147, [1997] 4 All ER 225, ''[[The Times]]'' (1997) 25 July 1997, [[House of Lords|HL]]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the defendants was prosecuted for this offence. [[Lord Steyn]] said:

{{Blockquote|The starting point must be that an assault is an ingredient of the offence under section 47. It is necessary to consider the two forms which an assault may take. The first is battery, which involves the unlawful application of force by the defendant upon the victim. Usually, section 47 is used to prosecute in cases of this kind. The second form of assault is an act causing the victim to apprehend an imminent application of force upon her: see ''Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner'' [1969] 1 Q.B. 439, 444D-E.}}

The second form of assault referred to is the offence described as [[common assault]] in section 39 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]], which is also known as [[psychic assault]] or simply [[assault]].

====Occasioning====
[[Blackstone's Criminal Practice]], 2001, says that "occasioning" is equivalent to causing (para B2.21 at p.&amp;nbsp;172) and has a specimen form of indictment that uses the word "caused" (para B2.18 at p.&amp;nbsp;171).

In ''R v Roberts'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1971/4.html R v Roberts]'' (1971) 56 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr. App. R.]] 95, [[Court of Appeal|CA]]&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant gave a lift in his car, late at night, to a girl.

The girl said that while travelling in the defendant's car he sought to make advances towards her and then tried to take her coat off. She said that this was the last straw, and although the car was travelling at some speed, she jumped out and sustained injuries. The defendant said that he had not touched the girl. He said that he had had an argument with her and that in the course of that argument she suddenly opened the door and jumped out.&lt;ref&gt;This is how the facts are described in ''R v Savage''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Stephenson (judge)|Stephenson LJ]] said that the test for determining whether the defendant had "occasioned" the injuries that the girl had suffered as a result of jumping out of the car was this:

{{quote|Was it [the action of the victim which resulted in actual bodily harm] the natural result of what the alleged assailant said and did, in the sense that it was something that could reasonably have been foreseen as the consequence of what he was saying or doing? As it was put in one of the old cases, it had got to be shown to be his act, and if of course the victim does something so "daft" in the words of the appellant in this case, or so unexpected, not that this particular assailant did not actually foresee it but that no reasonable man could be expected to foresee it, then it is only in a very remote and unreal sense a consequence of his assault, it is really occasioned by a voluntary act on the part of the victim which could not reasonably be foreseen and which breaks the chain of causation between the assault and the harm or injury.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1971/4.html R v Roberts]'' (1971) 56 Cr. App. R. 95 at 102, [[Court of Appeal|CA]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This passage was set out in ''R v Savage, DPP v Parmenter'' at page 14.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/1.html R v Savage, DPP v Parmenter]'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The book "Archbold" says that this test applies to any case where the injury was not the direct result of the defendant's act.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, paragraph 19-195 at page 1612&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''R v Savage'', ''DPP v Parmenter'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/1.html ''R v Savage'', ''DPP v Parmenter''] [1992] 1 AC 699, [1991] 3 WLR 914, [1991] 4 All ER 698, (1991) 94 Cr App R 193, [1992] Crim LR 288, [[House of Lords|HL]]&lt;/ref&gt; Savage threw beer over the victim and, in the struggle, the glass broke and cut the victim. It was held that section 47 did not require proof of [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]] in relation to the "occasioning". The throwing of the beer was an assault, and that "assault" had occasioned the actual bodily harm which occurred in the continuing struggle. Parmenter injured his baby by tossing him about too roughly. Even though the baby was too young to apprehend the physical contact, there was voluntary contact that caused injury, so Parmenter was liable under section 47 because the injury resulted from his intention to play with his son.

====Actual bodily harm====

{{main|Bodily harm}}

In ''Rex v. Donovan'',&lt;ref&gt;''Rex v. Donovan'' [1934] 2 KB 498, 25 Cr App R 1, 30 [[Cox's Criminal Cases|Cox]] 187, 50 TLR 566, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Swift J., in delivering the Judgement of the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]], said:

{{quote|For this purpose, we think that "bodily harm" has its ordinary meaning and includes any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the prosecutor. Such hurt or injury need not be permanent, but must, no doubt, be more than merely transient and trifling.&lt;ref&gt;''Rex v. Donovan'' [1934] 2 KB 498 at 509, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This passage was cited and approved in ''[[R v Brown]] (Anthony)'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/7.html ''R v. Brown (Anthony)''] [1994] 1 AC 212&lt;/ref&gt; by Lord Templeman (at p.&amp;nbsp;230) and Lord Jauncey (at p.&amp;nbsp;242).

In ''R v. Miller'' [1954] 2 All ER 529, [1954] 2 QB 282, Lynskey J. said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;According to ''Archbold's Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice'', 32nd ed, p 959:

"Actual bodily harm includes any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the prosecutor..."&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However the House of Lords rejected this definition in ''DPP v. Smith'',&lt;ref&gt;''DPP v. Smith'' [1961] AC 290&lt;/ref&gt; a case of grievous bodily harm in which the trial judge had described grievous bodily harm as "some harm which will seriously interfere for a time with health or comfort." The Lord Chancellor, Viscount Kilmuir QC, held:

{{quote|I can find no warrant for giving the words 'grievous bodily harm' a meaning other than that which the words convey in their ordinary natural meaning. 'Bodily harm' needs no explanation, and 'grievous' means no more and no less than 'really serious'.}}

''DPP v. Smith'' was followed in ''R v. Chan-Fook''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1993/1.html R v. Chan-Fook]'' [1994] 2 All ER at 557D&lt;/ref&gt; Hobhouse LJ. said of the expression "actual bodily harm", in contending that it should be given its ordinary meaning:

{{quote|We consider that the same is true of the phrase "actual bodily harm". These are three words of the English language that receive no elaboration and in the ordinary course should not receive any. The word "harm" is a synonym for injury. The word "actual" indicates that the injury (although there is no need for it to be permanent) should not be so trivial as to be wholly insignificant.}}

He went on to say:

{{quote|The danger of any elaboration of the words of the statute is that it may have the effect, as was pointed out by the House of Lords, of altering, or at the least distracting the Jury from, the ordinary meaning of the words. Further, as can be seen from the summing-up in the present case, there may be an elision of the need to show some harm or injury. There will be a risk that language will be used which suggests to the Jury that it is sufficient that the assault has interfered with the heath or comfort of the victim, whether or not any injury or hurt has been caused.}}

''R v Chan-Fook'' also followed the case of ''R v Metharam'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Metharam'' 45 Cr App R 304&lt;/ref&gt; in which Ashworth J had said:

{{quote|It is a misdirection to adopt the old formula and invite a jury to find a man accused of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm guilty if the only intent established is one to interfere seriously with the health or comfort.}}

In ''R v. Morris (Clarence Barrington)'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1997/2564.html R v. Morris (Clarence Barrington)]'' [1998] Cr. App. R. 386 at 393&lt;/ref&gt; Potter LJ., in delivering the judgement of the Court of Appeal said (the citations that he quotes from the textbook are omitted):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;What constitutes "actual bodily harm" for the purposes of section 47 of the 1861 Act is succinctly and accurately set out in ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice|Archbold]]'' (1997 ed.) at para 19-197:

"Bodily harm has it ordinary meaning and includes any ''hurt'' (our emphasis) or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the victim: such hurt or injury need not be permanent, but must be more than merely transient or trifling ...

Actual bodily harm is capable of including psychiatric injury but it does not include mere emotion, such as fear, distress or panic ..."&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''DPP v. Smith (Michael Ross)'',&lt;ref&gt;''DPP v. Smith (Michael Ross)'' [2006] EWHC 94 (Admin), [2006] 2 Cr App R. 2, [[Divisional Court|DC]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Judge, Baron Judge|Judge P.]] said:

{{quote|"Actual", as defined in the authorities, means that the bodily harm must not be so trivial or trifling as to be effectively without significance.&lt;ref&gt;''DPP v Smith (Michael Ross)'' [2006] 2 Cr App R 2 at paragraph 17, DC&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Glanville Williams said that actual bodily harm is a silly expression because it suggests that there is some form of bodily harm that is not actual.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Williams. Textbook of Criminal Law. First Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1978. Page 154. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8KpKAQAAIAAJ Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Cutting hair =====

In ''DPP v Smith (Michael Ross)'', the defendant held down his former girlfriend and cut off her ponytail with kitchen scissors a few weeks before her 21st birthday.{{fact|date=June 2017}} The Magistrates acquitted him on the ground that, although there was undoubtedly an assault, it had not caused actual bodily harm, since there was no bruising or bleeding, and no evidence of any psychological or psychiatric harm. The victim’s distress did not amount to bodily harm. The Divisional Court allowed an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, rejecting the argument for the defendant that the hair was dead tissue above the scalp and so no harm was done. Judge P said:

{{quote|In my judgment, whether it is alive beneath the surface of the skin or dead tissue above the surface of the skin, the hair is an attribute and part of the human body. It is intrinsic to each individual and to the identity of each individual. Although it is not essential to my decision, I note that an individual's hair is relevant to his or her autonomy. Some regard it as their crowning glory. Admirers may so regard it in the object of their affections. Even if, medically and scientifically speaking, the hair above the surface of the scalp is no more than dead tissue, it remains part of the body and is attached to it. While it is so attached, in my judgment it falls within the meaning of "bodily" in the phrase "actual bodily harm". It is concerned with the body of the individual victim.}}{{fact|date=June 2017}}

It has been accepted that actual bodily harm includes any hurt or injury that interferes with the health or comfort of the victim, and which is more than transient or trifling. To damage an important physical aspect of a person’s bodily integrity must amount to actual bodily harm, even if the element damaged is dead skin or tissue. As Creswell J. commented in his short concurring judgment:

{{quote|To a woman her hair is a vitally important part of her body. Where a significant portion of a woman's hair is cut off without her consent, this is a serious matter amounting to actual (not trivial or insignificant) bodily harm.}}

=====CPS charging standards=====
The Crown Prosecution Service has revised the guidance in its publication "Offences Against the Person, Incorporating the Charging Standard" due to the enactment of section 58 of the [[Children Act 2004]] which provides that reasonable [[chastisement]] is not a defence to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Assertions at that time that minor injuries to children could be charged as actual bodily harm were withdrawn in 2011.

The CPS previously advised that an assault which resulted in nothing more than grazes, scratches, abrasions, minor bruising, swellings, reddening of the skin, superficial cuts or a black eye should be prosecuted as a common assault in the absence of aggravating factors other than injury.&lt;ref&gt;Ormerod, D. Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law. Thirteenth Edition. Oxford University Press. 2011. Page 620. The guidance was located at www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offences_against_the_person/#P48_1458.&lt;/ref&gt;

The charging standard states: "The offence of Common Assault carries a maximum penalty of six months’ imprisonment. This will provide the court with adequate sentencing powers in most cases. '''ABH should generally be charged where the injuries and overall circumstances indicate that the offence merits clearly more than six months; imprisonment and where the prosecution intend to represent that the case is not suitable for summary trial.'''"

And in reference to vulnerable victims such as children:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There may be exceptional cases where the injuries suffered by a victim are not serious and would usually amount to Common Assault but due to the presence of significant aggravating features (alone or in combination), they could more appropriately be charged as ABH contrary to section 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. This would '''only''' be where a sentence clearly in excess of six months' imprisonment ought to be available, having regard to the significant aggravating features.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The CPS also previously said that, by way of example, it considered the following injuries to be actual bodily harm and to be sufficiently serious that they could not be adequately reflected by a charge of [[common assault]] and ought normally to be prosecuted under section 47:

* The loss or breaking of a tooth or teeth
* Extensive or multiple [[bruise|bruising]]
* A displaced [[nosebleed|broken nose]]
* Minor [[bone fracture|fractures]] of bones
* Minor (but not superficial) cuts requiring medical treatment
* A recognised [[psychiatric disorder]]

Causing any of these injuries (by assault or battery) would constitute the [[actus reus]] of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

===Mens rea===

The [[mens rea]] of this offence is identical to that of assault or battery (depending on the mode by which the offence is committed). Accordingly, it does not correspond with the [[actus reus]]. Academic writers have termed this feature of the offence ''half mens rea''&lt;ref&gt;[[Glanville Williams]], ''Textbook of the Criminal Law'', 2 ed., 1983 p.192&lt;/ref&gt; and ''constructive liability''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith&amp;Hogan (2008). ''Criminal law text and materials'' (3rd ed.). OUP, New York, p.608&lt;/ref&gt;

The mens rea for this crime may be one of recklessness rather than [[intention (criminal law)|intention]] as to the commission of an assault or battery, and it is considered to be a crime of [[basic intent]].

The court in ''DPP v Parmenter'' ruled that, for this offence,

{{quote|...it is not necessary to show that Parmenter intended bodily harm; if he intended or was reckless as to the assault, and the actual bodily harm was a reasonably foreseeable result (whether or not it was or should have been foreseen by Parmenter himself), that is sufficient.}}

===Mode of trial===

In England and Wales, assault occasioning actual bodily harm is [[hybrid offence|triable either way]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] (c.43), section 17(1) and Schedule 1,  paragraph 5(h)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentence===

In England and Wales, a person guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c.100), section 47; the [[Penal Servitude Act 1891]] (54 &amp; 55 Vict. c.69), section 1(1); the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] (11 &amp; 12 Geo.6 c.58), section 1(1)&lt;/ref&gt; or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the [[prescribed sum]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] (c.43), section 32(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a person is convicted on indictment of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, other than an offence for which the sentence falls to be imposed under section 227 or 228 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], the court, if not precluded from sentencing an offender by its exercise of some other power, may impose a fine instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way in which the court has power to deal with him, subject however to any enactment requiring the offender to be dealt with in a particular way.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], section 163; this power was previously created by section 30(1) of the [[Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973]] and then by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/6/section/127 section 127] of the [[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Assault occasioning actual bodily harm is a specified offence for the purposes of chapter 5 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] because it is a specified violent offence.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], section 224(1) as read with section 224(3) and paragraph 20 Part 1 of Schedule 15&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a serious offence for the purposes of that Chapter because it is not, apart from section 225, punishable in the case of a person aged 18 or over by imprisonment for life, or by imprisonment for a determinate period of ten years or more.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], section 224(2)&lt;/ref&gt; This means that sections 227 and 228 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] (which relate to extended sentences) apply where a person is convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, committed after the commencement of section 227 or 228 (as the case may be) and the court considers that there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by the offender of further specified offences.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], sections 227(1) and 228(1)(a) and (b)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

See ''Crown Prosecution Service Sentencing Manual''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/assault_occasioning_actual_bodily_harm/index.html Crown Prosecution Service Sentencing Manual]''&lt;/ref&gt; for case law on sentencing. Relevant cases are:

It is inappropriate for the court to sentence an offender on the basis of racial aggravation where he has been convicted of this offence, but not the racially aggravated offence: ''R v. McGilliviray''; ''R v. Kentsch''.

In Northern Ireland, a person guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c.100), section 47; as amended by the [[Criminal Justice (No.2) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004]] (SI 2004/1991 (N.I.15)), article 4(2)(a)&lt;/ref&gt; or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months, or to a fine not exceeding the prescribed sum, or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1981]] (No.1675 (N.I.26)), article 46(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racially or religiously aggravated offence===

In England and Wales, section 29(1)(b) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] (c.37) creates the distinct offence of [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998#Racially or religiously aggravated offences|racially or religiously aggravated assault occasioning actual bodily harm]].

===Visiting Forces===

In England and Wales and Northern Ireland, assault occasioning actual bodily harm is an [[offence against the person]] for the purposes of section 3 of the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6and1Eliz2/15-16/67/section/3 section 3(6)] and Schedule, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6and1Eliz2/15-16/67/schedule/paragraph/1 paragraph 1(b)(i)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivative offences==

In a number of jurisdictions this offence has been replaced by an offence which is very similar.

=== Australia ===

South Australia's section 20(4) of the [[Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935]] creates the offence of [[assault causing harm]].

=== Canada ===

Section 267(b) of the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']] creates the offence of [[assault causing bodily harm]].

=== Republic of Ireland ===

Section 3 of the [[Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997]] (No.26) creates the offence of [[assault causing harm]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3661">In [[mathematics]], a '''bitopological space''' is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] endowed with ''two'' [[Topological space|topologies]]. Typically, if the set is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and the topologies are &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; then the bitopological space is referred to as &lt;math&gt;(X,\sigma,\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Continuity==

A [[map (mathematics)|map]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f:X\to X'&lt;/math&gt; from a bitopological space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; to another bitopological space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X',\tau_1',\tau_2')&lt;/math&gt; is called '''continuous''' or sometimes '''pairwise continuous''' if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] both as a map from &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X',\tau_1')&lt;/math&gt; and as map from &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X',\tau_2')&lt;/math&gt;.

==Bitopological variants of topological properties==
Corresponding to well-known properties of topological spaces, there are versions for bitopological spaces.
* A bitopological space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; is '''pairwise compact''' if each cover &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \{U_i\mid i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle U_i\in \tau_1\cup\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;, contains a finite subcover. In this case, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \{U_i\mid i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; must contain at least one member from &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; and at least one member from &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;
* A bitopological space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; is '''pairwise Hausdorff''' if for any two distinct points &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt; there exist disjoint &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle U_1\in \tau_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle U_2\in\tau_2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x\in U_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle y\in U_2&lt;/math&gt;.
* A bitopological space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; is '''pairwise zero-dimensional''' if opens in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1)&lt;/math&gt; which are closed in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; form a basis for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1)&lt;/math&gt;, and opens in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; which are closed in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1)&lt;/math&gt; form a basis for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt;.
* A bitopological space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\sigma,\tau)&lt;/math&gt; is called '''binormal''' if for every &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle F_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sigma&lt;/math&gt;-closed and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle F_\tau&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tau&lt;/math&gt;-closed sets there are &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle G_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sigma&lt;/math&gt;-open and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle G_\tau&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tau&lt;/math&gt;-open sets such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle F_\sigma\subseteq G_\tau&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle  F_\tau\subseteq G_\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle  G_\sigma\cap G_\tau= \empty.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24564">In [[mathematics]], a '''building''' (also '''Tits building''', '''Bruhat–Tits building''', named after [[François Bruhat]] and [[Jacques Tits]]) is a combinatorial and geometric structure which simultaneously  generalizes certain aspects of [[flag manifold]]s, finite [[projective plane]]s, and [[Riemannian symmetric space]]s. Initially introduced by Jacques Tits as a means to understand the structure of [[group of Lie type|exceptional groups of Lie type]], the theory has also been used to study the geometry and topology of [[homogeneous space]]s of [[p-adic Lie group]]s and their discrete subgroups of symmetries, in the same way that [[tree (mathematics)|trees]] have been used to study [[free group]]s.

==Overview==
The notion of a building was invented by [[Jacques Tits]] as a means of describing [[group of Lie type|simple algebraic groups]] over an arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|field]]. Tits demonstrated how to every such [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' one can associate a [[simplicial complex]] Δ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Δ(''G'') with an [[group action|action]] of ''G'', called the '''spherical building''' of ''G''. The group ''G'' imposes very strong combinatorial regularity conditions on the complexes Δ that can arise in this fashion. By treating these conditions as axioms for a class of simplicial complexes, Tits arrived at his first definition of a building. A part of the data defining a building Δ is a [[Coxeter group]] ''W'', which determines a highly symmetrical simplicial complex ''Σ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Σ''(''W'',''S''), called the ''Coxeter complex''. A building Δ is glued together from multiple copies of Σ, called its ''apartments'', in a certain regular fashion. When ''W'' is a finite Coxeter group, the Coxeter complex is a topological sphere, and the corresponding buildings are said to be of '''spherical type'''. When ''W'' is an [[affine Weyl group]], the Coxeter complex is a subdivision of the affine plane and one speaks of '''affine''', or '''Euclidean''', buildings. An affine building of type &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle\tilde{A}_1}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as an infinite [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] without terminal vertices.

Although the theory of semisimple algebraic groups provided the initial motivation for the notion of a building, not all buildings arise from a group. In particular, projective planes and [[generalized quadrangle]]s form two classes of graphs studied in [[incidence geometry]] which satisfy the axioms of a building, but may not be connected with any group. This phenomenon turns out to be related to the low rank of the corresponding Coxeter system (namely, two). Tits proved a remarkable theorem: all spherical buildings of rank at least three are connected with a group; moreover, if a building of rank at least two is connected with a group then the group is essentially determined by the building.

Iwahori–Matsumoto, Borel–Tits and Bruhat–Tits demonstrated that in analogy with Tits' construction of spherical buildings, affine buildings can also be constructed from certain groups, namely, reductive algebraic groups over a [[local field|local non-Archimedean field]]. Furthermore, if the split rank of the group is at least three, it is essentially determined by its building. Tits later reworked the foundational aspects of the theory of buildings using the notion of a '''chamber system''', encoding the building solely in terms of adjacency properties of simplices of maximal dimension; this leads to simplifications in both spherical and affine cases. He proved that, in analogy with the spherical case, every building of affine type and rank at least four arises from a group.

==Definition==
An ''n''-dimensional '''building''' ''X'' is an [[abstract simplicial complex]] which is a union of subcomplexes ''A'' called '''apartments''' such that

* every ''k''-simplex of ''X'' is within at least three ''n''-simplices if ''k'' &lt; ''n'';
* any (''n'' – 1 )-simplex in an apartment  ''A'' lies in exactly two ''adjacent'' ''n''-simplices of ''A'' and the [[graph theory|graph]] of adjacent ''n''-simplices is connected;
* any two simplices in ''X'' lie in some common apartment ''A'';
* if two simplices both lie in apartments ''A'' and ''A'' ', then there is a simplicial isomorphism of ''A'' onto ''A'' ' fixing the vertices of the two simplices.

An ''n''-simplex in ''A'' is called a '''chamber''' (originally ''chambre'', i.e. ''room'' in [[French language|French]]).

The '''rank''' of the  building is defined to be ''n'' + 1.

==Elementary properties==
Every apartment ''A'' in a building is a '''[[Coxeter complex]]'''. In fact, for every two ''n''-simplices intersecting in an (''n'' – 1)-simplex or ''panel'', there is a unique period two simplicial automorphism of ''A'', called a ''reflection'', carrying one ''n''-simplex onto the other and fixing their common points. These reflections generate a [[Coxeter group]] ''W'', called the [[Weyl group]] of ''A'', and the simplicial complex ''A'' corresponds to the standard geometric realization of ''W''. Standard generators of the Coxeter group are given by the reflections in the walls of a fixed chamber in ''A''. Since
the apartment ''A'' is determined up to isomorphism by the building, the same is true of any two simplices in ''X'' lying in some common apartment ''A''. When ''W'' is finite, the building is said to be '''spherical'''. When it is an [[affine Weyl group]], the building is said to be '''affine''' or '''euclidean'''.

The '''chamber system''' is given by the adjacency graph formed by the chambers; each pair of adjacent chambers can in addition be labelled by one of the standard
generators of the Coxeter group (see {{harvnb|Tits|1981}}).

Every building has a canonical [[intrinsic metric|length metric]] inherited from the geometric realisation obtained by identifying the vertices with an [[orthonormal basis]] of a [[Hilbert space]]. For affine buildings, this metric satisfies the [[CAT(k) space|CAT(0)]] comparison inequality of [[Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov|Alexandrov]], known in this setting as the Bruhat-Tits ''non-positive curvature condition'' for geodesic triangles: the distance from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side is no greater than the distance in the corresponding Euclidean triangle with the same side-lengths (see {{harvnb|Bruhat|Tits|1972}}).

==Connection with BN pairs==
If a group ''G'' acts simplicially on a building ''X'', transitively on pairs (C,A) of chambers ''C'' and apartments ''A'' containing them, then the stabilisers of such a pair define a [[BN pair]] or [[Tits system]]. In fact the pair of subgroups

:''B'' = ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N'' = ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;

satisfies the axioms of a BN pair and the Weyl group can be identified with ''N'' / ''N'' &lt;math&gt; \cap &lt;/math&gt; ''B''.
Conversely the building can be recovered from the BN pair, so that every BN pair canonically defines a building.
In fact, using the terminology of BN pairs and calling any conjugate of ''B'' a [[Borel subgroup]] and any group containing a Borel subgroup a [[parabolic subgroup]],

* the vertices of the building ''X'' correspond to maximal parabolic subgroups;
* ''k'' + 1 vertices form a ''k''-simplex whenever the intersection of the corresponding maximal parabolic subgroups is also parabolic;
* apartments are conjugates under ''G'' of the simplicial subcomplex with vertices given by conjugates under ''N'' of maximal parabolics containing ''B''.

The same building can often be described by different BN pairs. Moreover, not every building comes from a BN pair: this corresponds to the failure of classification results in low rank and dimension (see below).

==Spherical and affine buildings for SL&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;==
The simplicial structure of the affine and spherical buildings associated to ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;), as well as their interconnections, are easy to explain directly using only concepts from elementary [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] (see {{harvnb|Garrett|1997}}). In this case there are three different buildings, two spherical and one affine. Each is a union of ''apartments'', themselves simplicial complexes. For the affine building, an apartment is a simplicial complex [[tessellation|tessellating]] Euclidean space '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt; by (''n''-1)-dimensional simplices; while for a spherical building it is the finite simplicial complex formed by all ''(n-1)''! simplices with a given common vertex in the analogous tessellation in '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Each building is a simplicial complex ''X'' which has to satisfy the following axioms:

:* ''X'' is a union of apartments.
:* Any two simplices in ''X'' are contained in a common apartment.
:* If a simplex is contained in two apartments, there is a simplicial isomorphism of one onto the other fixing all common points.

===Spherical building===
Let ''F'' be a [[field (mathematics)|field]] and let ''X'' be the simplicial complex with vertices the non-trivial vector subspaces of ''V''=''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Two subspaces ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are connected if one of them is a subset of the other. The ''k''-simplices of ''X'' are formed by sets of ''k'' + 1 
mutually connected subspaces. Maximal connectivity is obtained by taking ''n'' - 1 proper non-trivial subspaces and the corresponding (''n''-1)-simplex corresponds to a ''[[Flag (linear algebra)|complete flag]]''

: (0) &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ··· &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' – 1 &lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ''V''

Lower dimensional simplices correspond to partial flags with fewer intermediary subspaces ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

To define the apartments in ''X'', it is convenient to define a ''frame'' in ''V'' as a basis (''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) determined up to scalar multiplication of each of its vectors ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;; in other words a frame is a set of one-dimensional subspaces ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''F''·''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; such that any ''k'' of them generate a ''k''-dimensional subspace. Now an ordered frame ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; defines a complete flag via

: ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt; \oplus&lt;/math&gt; ···  &lt;math&gt; \oplus&lt;/math&gt; ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;

Since reorderings of the ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s also give a frame, it is straightforward to see that the subspaces, obtained as sums of the ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s,
form a simplicial complex of the type required for an apartment of a spherical building. The axioms for a building can easily be verified using the classical [[Schreier refinement theorem|Schreier refinement argument]] used to prove the uniqueness of the [[Jordan-Hölder decomposition]].

===Affine building===
Let ''K'' be a field lying between '''Q''' and its [[p-adic number|p-adic completion]] '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to the usual [[Archimedean property|non-Archimedean]] [[p-adic norm]] 
||''x''||&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; on '''Q''' for some prime ''p''. Let ''R'' be the [[subring]] of ''K'' defined by

:&lt;math&gt; R = \{x: \| x\|_p\le 1\}.&lt;/math&gt;

When ''K'' = '''Q''', ''R'' is the [[Localization of a ring|localization]] of '''Z''' at ''p'' and, when ''K'' = '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R'' = '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[p-adic integer]]s, i.e. the closure of '''Z''' in '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The vertices of the building ''X'' are the ''R''-lattices in ''V'' = ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. ''R''-[[submodules]] of the form

:''L'' = ''R''·''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; ···&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;  ''R''·''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;

where (''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a basis of ''V'' over ''K''. Two lattices are said to be ''equivalent'' if one is a scalar multiple of the other by an element of 
the multiplicative group ''K''* of ''K'' (in fact only integer powers of ''p'' need be used). Two lattice ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are said to be ''adjacent'' if some lattice equivalent to ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lies between ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and its sublattice ''p''·''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: this relation is symmetric. The ''k''-simplices of ''X'' are equivalence classes of ''k'' + 1 mutually adjacent lattices, The (''n'' - 1)- simplices correspond, after relabelling, to chains

:''p''·''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ··· &lt;math&gt; \subset&lt;/math&gt; ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' – 1 &lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt; \subset&lt;/math&gt; ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;

where each successive quotient has order ''p''. Apartments are defined by fixing a basis (''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) of ''V'' and taking all lattices with basis
(''p''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) where (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) lies in '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and is uniquely determined up to addition
of the same integer to each entry.

By definition each apartment has the required form and their union is the whole of ''X''. The second axiom follows by a variant of the Schreier refinement argument. The last
axiom follows by a simple counting argument based on the orders of finite Abelian groups of the form

:''L'' + ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ·''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ·''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; .

A standard compactness argument shows that ''X'' is in fact independent of the choice of ''K''. In particular taking ''K'' = '''Q''', it follows that ''X'' is countable. On the other hand, taking ''K'' = '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, the definition shows that ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) admits a natural simplicial action on the building.

The building comes equipped with a ''labelling'' of its vertices with values in '''Z''' / ''n'' '''Z'''. Indeed, fixing a reference lattice ''L'', the label of ''M'' is given by

:label (''M'') = log&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; |''M''/ ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ''L''| modulo ''n''

for ''k'' sufficiently large. The vertices of any (''n'' – 1)-simplex in ''X'' have distinct labels, running through the whole of '''Z''' / ''n'' '''Z'''. Any simplicial automorphism φ of ''X'' defines a permutation π of '''Z''' / ''n'' '''Z''' such that label (φ(''M'')) = π(label (''M'')). In particular for ''g'' in  ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;),

:label (''g''·''M'') = label (''M'') + log&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; || det ''g'' ||&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; modulo ''n''.

Thus ''g'' preserves labels if ''g'' lies in ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Automorphisms===
Tits proved that any label-preserving [[automorphism]] of the affine building arises from an element of  ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;). Since automorphisms of the building permute the labels, there is a natural homomorphism

:Aut ''X'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The action of ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) gives rise to an [[cyclic permutation|n-cycle]] τ. Other automorphisms of the building arise from [[outer automorphism]]s of ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) associated with automorphisms of the [[Dynkin diagram]]. Taking the standard
symmetric bilinear form with orthonormal basis ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the map sending a lattice to its dual lattice gives an automorphism whose square is the identity, giving the permutation σ that sends each label to its negative modulo ''n''. The image of the above homomorphism is generated by σ and τ and is isomorphic to the [[dihedral group]] ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of order ''2n''; when ''n'' = 3, it gives the whole of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

If ''E'' is a finite [[Galois extension]] of '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and the building is constructed from ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''E'') instead of ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[Galois group]] Gal (''E''/'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) will also act by automorphisms on the building.

===Geometric relations===
Spherical buildings arise in two quite different ways in connection with the affine building ''X'' for ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;):
 
* The [[link (geometry)|link]] of each vertex ''L'' in the affine building corresponds to submodules of ''L''/''p''·''L'' under the finite field ''F'' = ''R''/''p''·''R'' = '''Z'''/(''p''). This is just the spherical building for ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'').
* The building ''X'' can be ''[[compactification (mathematics)|compactified]]'' by adding the spherical building for ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) as boundary "at infinity" (see {{harvnb|Garrett|1997}} or {{harvnb|Brown|1989}}).

===Bruhat-Tits trees with complex multiplication===

When ''L'' is an archimedean local field then on the building for the group ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;(''L'') an additional structure can be imposed of a building with complex multiplication. These were first introduced by [[Martin L. Brown]]  ({{harvnb|Brown|2004}}). These buildings arise when a quadratic extension of ''L'' acts on the vector space ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These building with complex multiplication can be extended to any global field. They  describe  the action of the Hecke operators on  Heegner points on the classical modular curve ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt;(''N'') as well as on the Drinfeld modular curve ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Drin&lt;/sup&gt;(''I''). These buildings with complex multiplication are completely classified for the case of ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;(''L'') in {{harvnb|Brown|2004}}

==Classification==
Tits proved that all irreducible spherical buildings (i.e. with finite [[Weyl group]]) of rank greater than 2 are associated to simple algebraic or classical groups.
A similar result holds for irreducible affine buildings of dimension greater than two (their buildings "at infinity" are spherical of rank greater than two). In lower rank or dimension, there is no such classification. Indeed, each [[incidence structure]] gives a spherical building of rank 2 (see {{harvnb|Pott|1995}}); and Ballmann and Brin proved that every 2-dimensional simplicial complex in which the links of vertices are isomorphic to the [[flag complex]] of a finite projective plane has the structure of a building, not necessarily classical. Many 2-dimensional affine buildings have been constructed using hyperbolic [[reflection group]]s or other more exotic constructions connected with [[orbifold]]s.

Tits also proved that every time a building is described by a BN pair in a group, then in almost all cases the automorphisms of the building correspond to automorphisms of the group (see {{harvnb|Tits|1974}}).

==Applications==

The theory of buildings has important applications in several rather disparate fields. Besides the already mentioned connections with the structure of reductive algebraic groups over general and local fields, buildings are used to study their [[group representation|representations]]. The results of Tits on determination of a group by its building have deep connections with [[Mostow rigidity theorem|rigidity theorems]] of [[George Mostow]] and [[Grigory Margulis]], and with [[Margulis arithmeticity]].

Special types of buildings are studied in discrete mathematics, and the idea of a geometric approach to characterizing simple groups proved very fruitful in the [[classification of finite simple groups]]. The theory of buildings of type more general than spherical or affine is still relatively undeveloped, but these generalized buildings have already found applications to construction of [[Kac–Moody algebra|Kac–Moody groups]] in algebra, and to nonpositively curved manifolds and [[hyperbolic group]]s in topology and [[geometric group theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9636">'''Collective identity''' is the shared sense of belonging to a group.

==In sociology==
{{See also|Collective action| Social movement| Social role}}

In 1989, [[Alberto Melucci]] published Nomads of the Present, which introduces his model of collective identity based on studies of the social movements of the 1980s. Melucci based his ideas on the writings by Touraine and Pizzorno, specifically their ideas on [[social movements]] and [[collective action]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Touraine, Alain. ''An Introduction to the Study of Social Movements''. Social Research,1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberto Melucci writes, "collective identity is an interactive and shared definition produced by several individuals (or groups at a more complex level) and concerned with the orientation of action and the field of opportunities and constraints in which the action takes place". Unsatisfied with the gap between theories on how collective actions form and how individuals find motivation, Melucci defines an intermediate process, in which individuals recognize that they share certain orientations in common and on that basis decide to act together. He considers collective identity as a process that is negotiated over time with three parts: cognitive definition, active relationship, and emotional investments.&lt;ref&gt;Melucci, Alberto. ''Nomad of the Present''. Temple University Press , 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Cognitive Definitions: the formulation of a cognitive framework concerning goals, means, and environment of action
#Active Relationship: the activation of relationships among participants
#Emotional Investments: emotional recognition between individuals.

Melucci, in his writing "The Process of Collective Identity" argues for collective identity as a useful analytical tool to explain social movements. It addresses not only the processes within the system of the collective actor such as leadership models, ideologies, or communication methods, but also external relations with allies and competitors which all shape the collective actor. He goes on to state that it can help better understand the development of modern collective action, distinct from formal organizations, amidst the rapid development of the field of social science research. In addition, it makes collective groups as systematic collectives and not entities of ideology or defined simple value sets that could antagonize or glorify certain groups. For conflict analysis, this distinction can change the language and nature of analysis completely.&lt;ref&gt;Melucci, Alberto. ''The Process of Collective Identity''. Temple University Press , 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In social psychology==
{{See also|Social identity theory |Social identity approach}}

Social psychologists had interest in concepts of identity and individuality since its early days, tracing as far back as the work of George Mead. His theories focused on the relationship between individual identity and society. He theorizes a chicken-and-egg relationship between society and identity. Preexisting social structure and conditions shape a person’s identity, which in turn, interacts with others and shapes the new and emerging social structure.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, George Herbert. ''Mind, Self, and Society''. University of Chicago Press. 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;

More contemporarily, Polletta and Jasper defined collective identity as “an individual’s cognitive, moral, and emotional connections with a broader community, category, practice, or institution.” The collective identity of a group are often expressed through the group’s cultures and traditions. The origin of the identity can be from within the group or outside the group, but ultimately, a collective identity is only formed upon the group members’ acceptance of the identity. Though defining collective identity to be a self-central concept, they emphasize on its distinction from concepts like ideology, motivation, and personal identity.&lt;ref&gt;Polletta, Francesca, and Jasper, James M. ''Collective Identity and Social Movements''. Annual Review of Sociology, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not to be confused with [[social identity theory]] or [[self-categorization theory]], collective identity focuses on the identity of the group as a whole, while the other theories focus on the identity of an individual(self)’s association with a group.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}to 2013

==In political science==
{{See also|Identity politics}}

[[Marxist]] concepts of [[class consciousness]] can be considered a root of collective identity. The identity of the class was tied to its values and interests, and includes solidarity. This idea of solidarity is shared by [[Durkheim]], who argues that collective identity helps create bonds between individuals through shared morals and goals. [[Max Weber]], in his book "Economy and Society", published posthumously in 1922, critiqued Marx's focus on production and instead suggests that class, status, and party form the three sources of collective identity.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, and Engels, Friedrich. ''The German Ideology''. New York, International. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max. ''Economy and Society''. Berkeley: University of Cali Press. 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Wendt]] is well known for his writings on constructivist political theory, in which collective identity play a prominent role as identity is a major determining factor in the role of states in the international order. His approach focuses on group and individual identity, at the domestic and international level. This application of collective identity to explaining and describing the international system is the basis of constructivism. [[Constructivism (international relations)|Constructivism]] has a strong focus on the social discourse that create these identities, which not only designate a country as a collective actor but possible alliances as collective groups. By grouping together countries, either by their own decision or by third parties, new alliances or blocs form through the collective identity assigned to them, even if sometimes this assignment is based on inaccurate binary groupings. Regardless of accuracy of grouping, the very act of grouping these countries together affects how the international system views them and thus treats them, which in return causes the countries to identify with each other in terms of their common position internationally. Further work on collective identity in international relations has been conducted by [[Richard Ned Lebow]], who has argued that states view themselves and others as parts of collective power groups of states, such as rising and falling powers, and simply their sense of belonging to certain power groups or aspiring to be in others affects their interactions with other states, irrespective of the "reality" of their power statuses.

==Evolutionary function==
{{One source|section|date=November 2012}}
[[Joseph Jordania]] suggested that in [[human evolution]]ary history collective identity was crucial for the physical survival of [[hominids]] and [[early humans]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jordania, 2011. [[Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution]],pg 98-102&lt;/ref&gt; As individual hominids were too weak and slow to survive [[Predation|predators]] on their own,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jordania, 2011. [[Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution]],pg 92-95&lt;/ref&gt; in the moments most critical to survival ([[predator]] attacks, [[combat]] situations, mortal danger) humans enter the [[altered state of consciousness]] where they do not feel [[fear]] and [[pain]], do not question the behavior of other members of their group, and are ready to sacrifice their lives for evolution's more important super-ordinate goals (i.e. survival of the children or the group). Humans sometimes do not have [[memory]] of these critical moments. Absence of stressful memories is known as [[psychogenic amnesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.human-memory.net/disorders_psychogenic.html Psychogenic Amnesia (The Human Memory: What it is, how it works, and how it can go wrong)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arzy, S., Collette, S., Wissmeyere, M., Lazeyras, F., Kaplan, P. W. &amp; Blank, O. (2001). "Psychogenic amnesia and self-identity: a multimodal functional investigation". European Journal of Neurology 18: 1422–1425&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jordania]], human ability to follow the [[rhythm]] in big groups, to [[singing|sing]] together in [[harmony]], to [[dance]] for many hours and enter the ecstatic state, as well as the tradition of [[body painting]], were all the parts of the first universal rituals. These were primarily developed as the means to synchronize each individual group-member's neural activity (through the release of neuro-chemicals), in order to reach the state of collective identity, also known as transcendence. In this state the survival needs of the group can override the [[instinct]]s of individual survival.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7544">In [[mathematics]], '''contour sets''' [[Generalization|generalize]] and [[Formal system|formalize]] the everyday notions of
*everything superior to something
*everything superior or equivalent to something
*everything inferior to something
*everything inferior or equivalent to something.

== Formal definitions ==
Given a [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] on pairs of [[Element (mathematics)|element]]s of [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\succcurlyeq~\subseteq~X^2&lt;/math&gt;
and an element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;

The '''upper contour set''' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; that are related to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succcurlyeq x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''lower contour set''' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is related to them:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succcurlyeq y\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''strict upper contour set''' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; that are related to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; without &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; being ''in this way'' related to any of them:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~(y\succcurlyeq x)\land\lnot(x\succcurlyeq y)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''strict lower contour set''' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is related to them without any of them being ''in this way'' related to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~(x\succcurlyeq y)\land\lnot(y\succcurlyeq x)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The formal expressions of the last two may be simplified if we have defined
:&lt;math&gt;\succ~=~\left\{ \left(a,b\right)~\backepsilon~\left(a\succcurlyeq b\right)\land\lnot(b\succcurlyeq a)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
so that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is related to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' related to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, in which case the strict upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succ x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

and the strict lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succ y\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Contour sets of a function ===
In the case of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f()&lt;/math&gt; considered in terms of relation &lt;math&gt;\triangleright&lt;/math&gt;, reference to the contour sets of the function is implicitly to the contour sets of the implied relation
:&lt;math&gt;(a\succcurlyeq b)~\Leftarrow~[f(a)\triangleright f(b)]&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Arithmetic ===
Consider a [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and the relation [[Inequality (mathematics)|&lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt;]].  Then
* the upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of numbers that were ''greater than or equal'' to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
* the ''strict'' upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of numbers that were ''greater'' than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
* the lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of numbers that were ''less than or equal'' to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and
* the ''strict'' lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of numbers that were ''less'' than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider, more generally, the relation
:&lt;math&gt;(a\succcurlyeq b)~\Leftarrow~[f(a)\ge f(b)]&lt;/math&gt;
Then
* the upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(y)\ge f(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* the ''strict'' upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(y)&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* the lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)\ge f(y)&lt;/math&gt;, and
* the ''strict'' lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&gt;f(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

It would be ''technically'' possible to define contour sets in terms of the relation
:&lt;math&gt;(a\succcurlyeq b)~\Leftarrow~[f(a)\le f(b)]&lt;/math&gt;
though such definitions would tend to confound ready understanding.

In the case of a real-valued function &lt;math&gt;f()&lt;/math&gt; (whose arguments might or might not be themselves real numbers), reference to the contour sets of the function is implicitly to the contour sets of the relation
:&lt;math&gt;(a\succcurlyeq b)~\Leftarrow~[f(a)\ge f(b)]&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the arguments to &lt;math&gt;f()&lt;/math&gt; might be [[Tuple|vector]]s, and that the [[Mathematical notation|notation]] used might instead be
:&lt;math&gt;[(a_1 ,a_2 ,\ldots)\succcurlyeq(b_1 ,b_2 ,\ldots)]~\Leftarrow~[f(a_1 ,a_2 ,\ldots)\ge f(b_1 ,b_2 ,\ldots)]&lt;/math&gt;

=== Economic ===
In [[economics]], the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; could be interpreted as a set of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods and services]] or of possible [[Outcome (game theory)|outcomes]], the relation &lt;math&gt;\succ&lt;/math&gt; as ''strict [[preference]]'', and the relationship &lt;math&gt;\succcurlyeq&lt;/math&gt; as ''weak preference''.  Then
* the upper contour set, or '''better set''',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Economic Exchange and Social Organization: The Edgeworthian Foundations of General Equilibrium Theory|last = Robert P. Gilles|first = |publisher = Springer|year = 1996|isbn = |location = |pages = 35|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZyahaTvMB3cC&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;ots=4CelGh9izH&amp;dq=%22better%20set%22%20economics&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q=%22better%20set%22%20}}&lt;/ref&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were ''at least as desired'' as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
* the ''strict'' upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were ''more desired'' than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
* the lower contour set, or '''worse set''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were ''no more desired'' than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and
* the ''strict'' lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were ''less desired'' than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Such preferences might be captured by a [[utility]] function &lt;math&gt;u()&lt;/math&gt;, in which case
* the upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(y)\ge u(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* the ''strict'' upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(y)&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* the lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(x)\ge u(y)&lt;/math&gt;, and
* the ''strict'' lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(x)&gt;u(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Complementarity ==
On the assumption that &lt;math&gt;\succcurlyeq&lt;/math&gt; is a [[total order]]ing of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of the upper contour set is the strict lower contour set.
:&lt;math&gt;X^2\backslash\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succcurlyeq x\right\}=\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succ y\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;X^2\backslash\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succ y\right\}=\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succcurlyeq x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

and the complement of the strict upper contour set is the lower contour set.
:&lt;math&gt;X^2\backslash\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succ x\right\}=\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succcurlyeq y\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;X^2\backslash\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succcurlyeq y\right\}=\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succ x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Cromwell's rule''', named by statistician [[Dennis Lindley]],&lt;ref&gt;Jackman, Simon (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=QFqyrNL8yEkC&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bayesian Analysis for the Social Sciences], Wiley. {{ISBN|978-0-470-01154-6}} (ebook {{ISBN|978-0-470-68663-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt; states that the use of [[prior probability|prior probabilities]] of 0 ("the event will definitely not occur") or 1 ("the event will definitely occur") should be avoided, except when applied to statements that are logically true or false, such as 2+2 equaling 4 or 5.

The reference is to [[Oliver Cromwell]], who wrote to the General Assembly of the [[Church of Scotland]] on 5 August 1650, including a phrase that has become well known and frequently quoted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches |editor-last=Carlyle |editor-first=Thomas |year=1855 |publisher=Harper |location=New York |volume=1 |page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken.}}

As Lindley puts it, assigning a probability should "leave a little probability for the moon being made of green cheese; it can be as small as 1 in a million, but have it there since otherwise an army of astronauts returning with samples of the said cheese will leave you unmoved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Making Decisions |last=Lindley |first=Dennis |year=1991 |edition=2 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0-471-90808-8 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in assessing the likelihood that tossing a coin will result in either a head or a tail facing upwards, there is a possibility, albeit remote, that the coin will land on its edge and remain in that position.

If the prior probability assigned to a hypothesis is 0 or 1, then, by [[Bayes' theorem]], the [[posterior probability]] (probability of the hypothesis, given the evidence) is forced to be 0 or 1 as well; no evidence, no matter how strong, could have any influence.

A strengthened version of Cromwell's rule, applying also to statements of arithmetic and logic, alters the first rule of probability, or the convexity rule, 0 ≤ Pr(''A'') ≤ 1, to 0 &lt; Pr(''A'') &lt; 1.

== Bayesian divergence (pessimistic) ==
An example of Bayesian divergence of opinion is based on Appendix A of Sharon Bertsch McGrayne's 2011 book.&lt;ref&gt;McGrayne, Sharon Bertsch. (2011). ''The Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes' Rule Cracked The Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, &amp; Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy.'' New Haven: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|9780300169690}}; [http://www.worldcat.org/title/theory-that-would-not-die-how-bayes-rule-cracked-the-enigma-code-hunted-down-russian-submarines-emerged-triumphant-from-two-centuries-of-controversy/oclc/670481486 OCLC 670481486] {{Google books|_Kx5xVGuLRIC|''The Theory That Would Not Die,'' pages 263-265}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Tim and Susan disagree as to whether a stranger who has two fair coins and one unfair coin (one with heads on both sides) has tossed one of the two fair coins or the unfair one; the stranger has tossed one of his coins three times and it has come up heads each time. 

Tim assumes that the stranger picked the coin randomly – i.e., assumes a [[prior probability|prior probability distribution]] in which each coin had a 1/3 chance of being the one picked. Applying [[Bayesian inference#Probability of a hypothesis|Bayesian inference]], Tim then calculates an 80% probability that the result of three consecutive heads was achieved by using the unfair coin, because each of the fair coins had a 1/8 chance of giving three straight heads, while the unfair coin had an 8/8 chance; out of 24 equally likely possibilities for what could happen, 8 out of the 10 that agree with the observations came from the unfair coin. If more flips are conducted, each further head increases the probability that the coin is the unfair one. If no tail ever appears, this probability converges to 1. But if a tail ever occurs, the probability that the coin is unfair immediately goes to 0 and stays at 0 permanently.

Susan assumes the stranger chose a fair coin (so the prior probability that the tossed coin is the unfair coin is 0). Consequently, Susan calculates the probability that three (or any number of consecutive heads) were tossed with the unfair coin must be 0; if still more heads are thrown, Susan does not change her probability. Tim and Susan's probabilities do not converge as more and more heads are thrown.

== Bayesian convergence (optimistic) ==
An example of Bayesian convergence of opinion is in Nate Silver's 2012 book ''[[The Signal and the Noise|The Signal and the Noise: Why so many predictions fail — but some don't]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silver|first=Nate|title=The Signal and the Noise: Why so many predictions fail -- but some don't|year=2012|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59-420411-1 |pages=258–261}}
&lt;/ref&gt; After stating, "Absolutely nothing useful is realized when one person who holds that there is a 0 (zero) percent probability of something argues against another person who holds that the probability is 100 percent", Silver describes a simulation where three investors start out with initial guesses of 10%, 50% and 90% that the stock market is in a bull market; by the end of the simulation (shown in a graph), "all of the investors conclude they are in a bull market with almost (although not exactly of course) 100 percent certainty."

'''Doris Stevens''' (October 26, 1888 – March 22, 1963) was an American [[Women's suffrage|suffragist]], woman's legal rights advocate and author. She was the first female member of the [[American Institute of International Law]] and first chair of the [[Inter-American Commission of Women]].

Born in 1888 in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], Stevens became involved in the fight for [[suffrage]] while a college student at [[Oberlin College]]. After graduating with a degree in [[sociology]] in 1911, she taught briefly before becoming a paid regional organizer for the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]]'s [[Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage]] (CUWS). When the CUWS broke from the parent organization in 1914, Stevens became the national strategist. She was in charge of coordinating the women's congress, held at the [[Panama Pacific Exposition]] in 1915. When the CUWS became the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP) in 1916, Stevens organized party delegates for each of the 435 Congressional Districts in an effort to attain national women's enfranchisement and defeat candidates who were opposed to women's rights. Between 1917 and 1919, Stevens was a prominent participant in the [[Silent Sentinels]] vigil at [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[White House]] to urge the passage of a constitutional amendment for women's voting rights and was arrested several times for her involvement. After the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] secured women's right to vote, she wrote a book, titled ''Jailed for Freedom'' (1920), which recounted the sentinel's ordeals.

Once the right to vote was secured, Stevens turned her attention to women's legal status. She supported passage of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] and worked with [[Alice Paul]] from 1927–1933 on a volume of work comparing varying impact on law for women and men. The goal in compiling the data was to obtain an international law protecting women's right of citizenship. The research was completed with the help of feminists in 90 countries and evaluated laws controlling women's nationality from every country. Gaining approval for the work from the [[League of Nations]] in 1927, Stevens presented the proposal [[Organization of American States|Pan American Union]] in 1928, convincing the governing body to create the [[Inter-American Commission of Women]] (CIM). In 1931, she joined the American Institute of International Law, becoming its first female member. In 1933, her work resulted in the first treaty to secure international rights for women. The [[Convention on the Nationality of Women]] established that women retained their citizenship after marriage and Convention on Nationality provided that neither marriage nor divorce could affect the nationality of the members of a family, extending citizenship protection to children.

Ousted from the CIM in 1938, and the NWP in 1947 over policy disputes, Stevens became vice president of the [[Lucy Stone League]] in 1951, of which she had been a member since the 1920s. She fought the roll-back of policies removing the gains women had made to enter the work force during [[World War II]] and worked to establish feminism as an academic field of study. She continued fighting for feminist causes until her death in 1963.

==Early life==
Dora Caroline Stevens was born on October 26, 1888 in [[Omaha]], Nebraska to Caroline D. (née Koopman) and Henry Henderbourck Stevens.{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}}{{sfn|Trigg|2014|p=36}} Her father was a pastor of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] for forty years and her mother was a first generation immigrant from Holland.{{sfn|Trigg|2014|p=36}} One of four children, Stevens grew up in Omaha and graduated in 1905 from [[Omaha Central High School|Omaha High School]].{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}} She went on to further her education graduating from [[Oberlin College]] in 1911{{sfn|''Dayton Daily News''|2004}}{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}} with a degree in sociology, though she had originally pursued music. While in college, she was known for her romances and for being a spirited [[suffragette]]. Her unruly behavior and disdain for feminine propriety were cultivated during her college years.{{sfn|Trigg|2014|p=40}} After graduation, Stevens worked as a music teacher and [[social work]]er in [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]].{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}} and [[Montana]]{{sfn|''The Wichita Beacon''|1915|p=9}} before moving to [[Washington, D.C.]], where she became a regional organizer with the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA).{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}}

==Suffrage==
In 1913, Stevens arrived in Washington to take part in the June picketing of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. She did not plan to stay, but [[Alice Paul]] convinced her to do so.{{sfn|Stevens|1920|p=12}} She was hired by the NAWSA,{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}} and was assigned to the newly formed [[Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage]] (CUWS),{{sfn|Adams|Keene|2010|p=16}} which had been created by [[Alice Paul]] and [[Mary Ritter Beard]].{{sfn|Beard|Lane|1977|p=95}} At that time, the Congressional Union was a subdivision of the NAWSA, though it operated independently.{{sfn|Risjord|2005|p=206}} Stevens was hired to serve as executive secretary in Washington, D. C., as well as serve as regional organizer{{sfn|Adams|Keene|2010|p=16}}{{sfn|''Albuquerque Morning Journal''|1914|p=1}} and was assigned the eastern district. Paul had divided the nation into quadrants of twelve states each and assigned Stevens to the eastern area, [[Mabel Vernon]] to the middle west, [[Anne Henrietta Martin|Anne Martin]] to the far west, and [[Maud Younger]] to the south.{{sfn|Wheeler|1995|p=171}} The regional organizers were tasked with educating groups about the suffrage bills that were in Congress{{sfn|''Albuquerque Morning Journal''|1914|p=1}} and garnering support from each state for ratifying national suffrage. Rather than follow the previous strategy of achieving enfranchisement on a state-by-state basis, the Congressional Union Strategy was full federal approval. This issue, caused a rift in the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|suffrage movement]] at the 1913 Convention, causing Paul and her supporters to break ties with the NAWSA and become an independent organization.{{sfn|Buechler|1990|p=56}}

With the fissure, the Congressional Union began a reorganization to push for campaigns against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates because they had not supported suffrage while they were in control of the legislature.{{sfn|Buechler|1990|p=56}} Paul established an all-woman advisory council of suffrage workers and prominent women which included Bertha Fowler, [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], [[Helen Keller]], [[Belle Case La Follette]], [[May Wright Sewall]] and educators such as [[Emma Gillett]], [[Maria Montessori]], and [[Clara Louise Thompson]], a Latin Professor at [[Rockford University|Rockford College]], among others, to lend credibility to the new organization.{{sfn|Adams|Keene|2010|p=17}} Stevens became the national organizer, charged with organizing women in states in which they were able to vote to use their ballots and oppose any candidate not in favor of full enfranchisement of women.{{sfn|''Chicago Daily Tribune''|1915|p=5}} One of the first places Stevens traveled to was [[Colorado]],{{sfn|Simkin|2014}} where CUWS was successful in attaining commitment from one congressman to support the women's cause.{{sfn|''Chicago Daily Tribune''|1915|p=5}} Returning from that success in January 1915, she went to [[New York City]]{{sfn|''The Washington Post''|1915|p=16}} and [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]] to campaign before heading west.{{sfn|''La Grande Observer''|1915|p=6}} She campaigned in [[Kansas]], hoping to secure delegates for a convention planned in [[San Francisco]] for September.{{sfn|''The Wichita Beacon''|1915|p=9}}

Arriving in [[California]] in June, Stevens accompanied a group of women led by [[Charlotte Anita Whitney]] to meet with [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]] members who were meeting at the [[Palace Hotel, San Francisco|Palace Hotel]], in [[San Francisco]]. The women had been assured that they would be able to present their issues, but the chair, Representative [[John J. Fitzgerald]] of New York, refused to allow it.{{sfn|''San Francisco Chronicle''|1915|p=1}} Undaunted, Whitney and Stevens continued their planning efforts{{sfn|''Oakland Tribune''|8/1915|p=9}} for the [[Panama Pacific Exposition]] CUWS Congress in San Francisco.{{sfn|Simkin|2014}} In San Francisco at the CUWS headquarters in 1915, Stevens discussed the strategy of employing a "million-vote smile", positing that smiling was a useful tool in the fight to win over men's support. "Smile on men and they will give you a vote. Look severe and they won't," she stated.{{sfn|''Fort Wayne Sentinel''|1915|p=8}} However, when Alice Paul arrived two weeks before the event, she canceled choral events, a parade and a mass meeting that had been planned for the [[Scottish Rite]] Hall. Stevens had been involved in supervising each of these events, though local women planned and orchestrated them. Paul did keep the luncheon and a ball to be held at the California building of the exposition.{{sfn|''Oakland Tribune''|8/1915|p=9}} After the September Congress, Stevens had planned to remain in San Francisco and run the exposition booth of CUWS, but she was forced to return to Washington because the eastern delegate Margaret Whittemore had left due to her marriage.{{sfn|''Oakland Tribune''|9/1915|p=17}} Stevens immediately began planning for a convention to be held in Washington in December.{{sfn|''The Washington Times''|1915|p=3}} [[File:Bastille Day spells prison for sixteen suffragettes who picketed the White House. Miss Julia . . . - NARA - 533766.tif|thumb|[[Julia Hurlbut]] of Morristown, New Jersey, leading the sixteen members of the National Woman's Party who participated in the Bastille Day picketing demonstration in front of the White House, July 14, 1917, which led to their arrest]]

At the beginning of 1916, Stevens announced the policy that the CUWS had organized in twenty-two states and planned on recruiting delegates for each of the [[United States House of Representatives|435 House Districts]]. The delegates were required to form committees to press Congressional Members to favor suffrage and make them aware that their constituents were in favor of women attaining the vote.{{sfn|''The Washington Herald''|1916|p=10}} Another strategy Stevens began implementing early in 1916 required CUWS members to go to other states in which women were allowed to vote, establish residence and register to vote. In this way, they could vote in state and national elections in the hope of filling the legislature with legislators who favored suffrage. Stevens registered to vote in Kansas that year.{{sfn|''The Leavenworth Times''|1916|p=1}} On 5 June 1916, the CUWS became the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP), having a single platform to acquire a constitutional amendment for national women's suffrage.{{sfn|Simkin|2014}}{{sfn|Haskin|1916|p=8}} After attending the NWP convention in [[Chicago]] in June, Stevens headed to a convention in Colorado.{{sfn|''Chicago Daily Tribune''|1916|p=5}} By October, Stevens was organizing and managing the NWP election campaign in California.{{sfn|''San Francisco Chronicle''|1916|p=8}}[[File:Doris Stevens, Mrs. J.A.H. Hopkins Mrs. John Winters Brannan 160059v.jpg|thumb|National Woman's Party members in prison dress carrying wooden chairs, on rooftop of building.

==Arrest==
Due to the United States' entry into [[World War I]], some suffragists stopped their activism in 1917 because it might be seen as "unpatriotic;" Stevens, instead, insisted that it was "arrogant of Wilson to fight for democracy abroad when women were not included in democracy at home."{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}} In January after a delegation of NWP members had a disappointing meeting with President [[Woodrow Wilson]], it was decided that they would protest at the [[White House]] every day, standing as [[Silent Sentinels]] until Wilson recognized the importance of their cause.{{sfn|Southard|2007|pp=399–400}} The women maintained their post for over a year disregarding weather conditions and the threat of arrest.{{sfn|Southard|2007|pp=407}} Though she performed other organizational tasks, such as organizing the [[North Carolina]] branch of the NWP in March,{{sfn|''The Charlotte Observer''|1917|p=5}} Stevens participated as a sentinel. She and fifteen other women were arrested for picketing at the [[White House]] on [[Bastille Day]], in July 1917, charged with obstructing the sidewalk,{{sfn|''Tyrone Daily Herald''|1917|p=1}}{{sfn|''San Antonio Express''|1963}} and served three days of their 60-day sentence at [[Occoquan Workhouse]] before receiving a [[presidential pardon|pardon]] from President Wilson.{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}}{{sfn|Tiller|1917|p=39}}{{sfn|Tiller|1917|p=44}} The women were placed within the prison population, given no toothbrushes, combs or toiletries and were surprised that they were required to share a water dipper with the rest of the prisoners.{{sfn|Tiller|1917|p=39}}

Stevens met her first husband, [[Dudley Field Malone]], when he represented her for her protest in front of the White House.{{sfn|''Austin Daily Herald''|1950|p=4}} He had been serving as an [[United States Assistant Secretary of State#Third Assistant Secretary of State|Assistant Secretary of State]] in the Wilson [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]], but was converted to the suffragist cause and resigned his post.{{sfn|''Decatur Herald''|1929|p=1}} He appeared with Stevens at fundraising events and helped raise thousands of dollars for their cause, which was gaining momentum, as President Wilson finally endorsed enfranchisement. Between 1918 and 1919, Stevens continued alternating speaking engagements{{sfn|''The Palm Beach Post''|1918|p=1}} and picketing. She was arrested again, along with [[Elsie Hill]], Alice Paul and three "[[Jane Doe]]" suffragists at the NWP demonstration of the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]] in New York in March 1919.{{sfn|''The Leavenworth Times''|1919|p=1}} On 4 September 1920, the fight was won when Secretary of State [[Bainbridge Colby]] proclaimed the necessary 36 states had ratified the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] with [[Tennessee]]'s [[Ratification#Ratification in the United States Constitution|ratification]].{{sfn|Johnson|1920|p=4}} Stevens published the quintessential insider account of the imprisonment of NWP activists, ''Jailed for Freedom'', in 1920.{{sfn|Stevens|1920}}

[[File:Doris Stevens 157005v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Doris Stevens, 1919 Legislative Chairman, National Woman's Party]]Over the years, Stevens held several important NWP leadership positions, including Legislative Chairman{{sfn|''The Washington Herald''|1919|p=5}} and membership on the executive committee.{{sfn|Sherman|1924|p=3}} In 1920, [[Alva Belmont]] was elected president of the NWP{{sfn|Freeman|2002|p=129}} and Stevens served as Belmont’s personal assistant, even writing Belmont's autobiography.{{sfn|Hoffert|2011|p=xi}} Belmont and Steven's relationship was contentious, but the younger Stevens accepted years of control by Belmont over many of her personal actions. Traveling to Europe with Belmont for work of the NWP, Belmont insisted that Steven's fiance could not join them and when he did, Belmont removed to France without Stevens.{{sfn|Rupp|1989|pp=300–301}}

On 5 December 1921 in [[Peekskill, New York]], Stevens and Malone were secretly married by a hardware store owner who was a [[Justice of the Peace]] and immediately sailed{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1921|p=22}} for their two-month honeymoon in [[Paris]]. Stevens announced she would not take Malone's name and would remain "Doris Stevens".{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1922|p=15}} From the middle of the 1920s, Stevens lived primarily in [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York]],{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}}{{sfn|Miescher|Mitchell|Shibusawa|2015|p=275}} where she became friends with leading members of the [[Greenwich Village]] radical scene and bohemians, including [[Louise Bryant]],{{sfn|Miller|2010|p=243}} [[Max Eastman|Max]] and [[Crystal Eastman]],{{sfn|McKay|Jarrett|2007|p=95}} [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] and others.{{sfn|Miller|2010|p=243}} Stevens divorced Malone in 1929{{sfn|''Decatur Herald''|1929|p=1}} after a string of infidelities on both sides and failed attempts at reconciliation.{{sfn|Rupp|1989|p=295}}

==Equality activism==
The focus of the NWP shifted to equality under the law, including equal employment opportunities, jury service, nationality for married women and any other provision which legally prohibited women from having full legal equality. In 1923, the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] was introduced by [[Daniel Read Anthony, Jr.]] and the women pushed for its passage, lobbying for support from both political parties.{{sfn|Freeman|2002|p=129}} Stevens served as vice chair of NWP’s New York branch,{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}} spearheading the NWP Women for Congress campaign in 1924. Unable to run herself due to her having established a legal residence in France, Stevens worked toward the goal of securing the election of 100 women to Congress in states where female candidates were among contenders for office.{{sfn|Sherman|1924|p=3}} The campaign had negligible results and the women shifted back to equality measures.{{sfn|Freeman|2002|p=130}} Beginning in 1926, one of the proposals Stevens focused on for the next several years was the "Wages for Wives" marriage contract.{{sfn|Cott|1987|p=337}} Campaigning vigorously for its adoption, the "Wages for Wives" proposal called for a flexible contract which split marital assets 50-50 rather than treating married couples as a single entity and called for women to be paid a wage for domestic services and raising children as a protection for children's continuous support.{{sfn|Stephen|1926|p=20}}

From the end of the War, a growing belief among women's organizations was the notion that all women faced similar problems as subordinates to men and that combining their interests might lead to gains. At the [[International Council of Women]] (ICW) conference held in Washington in 1925, the sentiment was expressed by [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Lady Aberdeen]], welcoming all women to the "sisterhood, of whatever creed, party, section or class they may belong".{{sfn|Sandell|2015|pp=2–3}} In 1927, Stevens and Alice Paul undertook a massive study of how laws affected women's nationality; studying for example, if they lost their nationality by marrying or even became stateless.{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=1}} Stevens met with feminists throughout Europe and held public meetings to gather data, including Dr. [[Luisa Baralt]] of [[Havana]], Dr. [[Ellen Gleditsch]] of [[Oslo]], [[Chrystal Macmillan]] and [[Sybil Thomas, Viscountess Rhondda]] of the UK, the [[Marquesa del Ter]] of Spain, [[Maria Vérone]] of France and [[Hélène Vacaresco]] of Romania, as well as various officers of the [[International Federation of University Women]] and others.{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=2}} Paul reviewed the laws of each country. Together, they compiled a monumental report, which indexed all laws controlling women's nationality from every country in its native language and then translated each law on an accompanying page. Tables were provided for easy comparison and a synopsis of the laws was given. The report was initially prepared for a meeting that was to take place at the [[League of Nations]] in 1930 to discuss codification of international laws.{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=1}} Stevens felt that nationality of women should be included in that discussion and spearheaded the research,{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=2}} believing "feminism should strive for equal rights for women, and that women should be considered first and foremost as human beings."{{Sfn|Trigg|1995|p=79}} In September 1927, she attended a preliminary meeting of the League of Nations in [[Geneva]] and obtained their unanimous support of her proposal.{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=2}} She continued meeting with women and gathering data until January 1928, when she attended the [[Pan-American Conference]] in Havana. Stevens convinced the governing body of the [[Organization of American States|Pan American Union]] to create the [[Inter-American Commission of Women]] ({{lang-es|Comisión Interamericana de Mujeres}}) (CIM) on 4 April 1928.{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=3}}{{Sfn|Trigg|1995|p=57}} [[File:Doris Stevens, right 276050v.jpg|thumb|Doris Stevens, right, talking to Sra. [[Clara González]] at the Pan-American Conference of Havana, January, 1928]]

The initial Inter-American Commission of Women (CIM) was made up of seven women delegates who were charged with finalizing the report for the next Pan-American Conference (1933) to review civil and political equality for women.{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=1}} Stevens served as chair of the CIM from its creation in 1928{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=4}} until her ouster in 1938.{{sfn|Bredbenner|1998|pp=246–247}} By August, Stevens was back in Paris working on the report. She and other suffragists picketed the French president, [[Gaston Doumergue]], in 1928{{sfn|Ivy|1928|p=4}} in an attempt to get the world peace delegates to support an equal rights treaty.{{sfn|''Press-Courier''|1928|p=1}} They were dismissively described by a journalist who did cover the event as "militant suffragettes," and a Paris paper called the protest "an amusing incident."{{sfn|Ivy|1928|p=4}} Though arrested, they were released upon providing proof of their identities.{{sfn|''Press-Courier''|1928|p=1}}

In 1929, Stevens returned to the United States and began to study law, taking classes at the [[American University]] and [[Columbia University]] in international law and foreign policy.{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}} In 1930, she returned to Havana in February for the first meeting of the CIM women which included [[Flora de Oliveira Lima]] (Brazil), [[Aída Parada]] (Chile), [[Lydia Fernández]] (Costa Rica), [[Elena Mederos de González]] (Cuba), [[Gloria Moya de Jiménez]] (Dominican Republic), [[Irene de Peyré]] (Guatemala), [[Margarita Robles de Mendoza]] (Mexico), [[Juanita Molina de Fromen]] (Nicaragua), [[Clara González]] (Panama), [[Teresa Obregoso de Prevost]] (Peru).{{sfn|Seminar on Feminism and Culture|1990|p=17}} From Cuba, she went to [[The Hague]] for the first World Conference on the Codification of International Law held on 13 March. Presenting her data on what had been accomplished in the Americas, Stevens asked that the international community enact laws to protect women's citizenship.{{sfn|Sickmon|1930|p=3}} She returned to the United States and her studies. Though she didn't graduate,{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}} in 1931 she became the first woman member of the American Institute of International Law.{{sfn|Lee de Muñoz Marín|1931|p=1}} That same year, she, Belmont and Paul attended the League of Nations meeting in September{{sfn|Campbell|1931|p=4}} to present their nationality findings.{{sfn|McNamara|1931|p=4}}

==Seventh Pan-American Conference==
Stevens was very active in working with Latina feminists through the CIM.{{Sfn|Trigg|1995|p=77}} At the Seventh Pan-American Conference, held in 1933 in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, the women presented their analysis of the legal status of women in each of the 21 member countries. The first report ever to study in detail the civil and political rights of women, it had been prepared solely by women. They proposed a Treaty on the Equality of Rights for Women, and it was rejected by the conference, though it was signed by Cuba, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay.{{sfn|1933 resolutions|2015}} Three of those states had already granted suffrage to women, and none of the four ratified the Treaty after the conference. However, the women had presented the first international resolution to recommend suffrage for women.{{sfn|Towns|2010|p=795}} Next, Stevens presented their materials which showed the disparity between rights of men and women. For example, in 16 countries of the Americas women could not vote at all, in two countries they could vote with restrictions, and in three countries they had equal enfranchisement. In 19 of the American countries, women did not have equal custody over their children, including in seven [[U.S. state|US states]], and only two countries allowed joint authority for women of their own children. None of the Latin American countries allowed women to serve on juries, and 27 US states prohibited women from participating in juries. Divorce grounds in 14 countries and 28 states were disparate for men and women, and a woman could not administer her own separate property in 13 countries and two US states.{{sfn|Ganzert|1936|pp=C-5, C-10}}

After reviewing the data, the conference approved the first international agreement ever adopted on women's rights.{{sfn|1933 resolutions|2015}} The [[Convention on the Nationality of Women]] made it clear that should a woman marry a man of a different nationality, her citizenship could be retained.{{sfn|1933 resolutions|2015}} The text stated, "There shall be no distinction based on sex as regards to nationality". The conference also passed the Convention on Nationality, which established that neither marriage nor divorce could affect the nationality of the members of a family, extending citizenship protection to children as well.{{sfn|Shepherd|2014|p=326}} The [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration, hoping to get rid of Stevens, then argued that the women's task was completed and the CIM should be abandoned. Not wanting to bow to US pressure, the Conference did not vote to continue the CIM, but instead voted as a unit, with the exception of Argentina, to block the US proposal.{{sfn|Towns|2010|p=796}}

==Later career==
It would take FDR another five years,{{sfn|Bredbenner|1998|pp=246–247}} with the help of the [[League of Women Voters]] to replace Stevens.{{sfn|Trigg|1995|pp=64–65}} Making the argument that Stevens was appointed by the Conference of the Pan-American States and not as a U.S. delegate, FDR agreed to give permanent status to the CIM, if each state was allowed to appoint their own delegates. Securing approval, he then immediately replaced Stevens with [[Mary Nelson Winslow]].{{sfn|Bredbenner|1998|pp=246–247}} Stevens did not go quietly and the clash continued throughout 1939 with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] backing Winslow and suffragists backing Stevens.{{sfn|''The Delta Democrat-Times''|1939|p=6}} Eleanor's objection to Stevens was multi-faced, in that she did not think that the Equal Rights Amendment would protect women and on a personal level, she believed Stevens behaved in an unladylike manner.{{sfn|Pfeffer|1996}}
 
In 1940, Stevens was elected to serve on the National Council of the National Woman's Party.{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}} The following year, when Alice Paul returned from a two-year trip to Switzerland to establish the [[World Woman’s Party]] (WWP), difficulties arose. Paul experienced both challenges to the direction she was taking the NWP and had personality conflicts with members,{{sfn|Gavin|Clamar|Siderits|2007|pp=75–76}} including Stevens. When Alva Belmont died in 1933, the bequest she had promised Stevens for years of personal service was instead directed to the NWP. Stevens sued the estate, eventually receiving US$12,000, but she believed that Paul had sabotaged her relationship with Belmont.{{sfn|Rupp|1989|p=292}} After Paul's resignation in 1945, Stevens did not support Paul's hand-selected replacement, [[Anita Pollitzer]] and led an unsuccessful attempt to challenge her leadership.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=552}} Pollitzer was seen as a figurehead for Paul and an internal dispute arose over the NWP’s emphasis on the WWP and international rights rather than domestic organizing. During these tensions, a dissenting faction of NWP members tried to take over party headquarters and elect their own slate of officers,{{sfn|Short|Purcell|2013}} but Pollitzer’s claim to leadership was supported by a ruling of a federal district judge.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=552}}

Stevens parted ways with the NWP in 1947 and turned instead to activity in the [[Lucy Stone League]],{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}} a women’s rights organization based on [[Lucy Stone]]'s retention of her [[maiden name]] after marriage. After [[World War II]] ended, the organization was revived in 1950 because the rights women had seen surge during the war were reverting to their pre-war state. Stevens was one of the reorganizers along with [[Freda Kirchwey]], [[Frances Perkins]] and others.{{sfn|''Toledo Blade''|1950|p=10}} Stevens had long been a proponent of a woman retaining her own name{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1922|p=15}} and did not take her husband's name in either of her marriages.{{sfn|''The Racine Sunday Bulletin''|1963|p=2A}} She had remarried to Jonathan Mitchell on August 31, 1935 in [[Portland, Maine]].{{sfn|''Oakland Tribune''|1935|p=1}} Mitchell was a reporter for ''[[The New Republic]]'' during the Roosevelt years{{sfn|Pearson|1954|p=4}} and later for the ''[[National Review]]'', and was an anti-communist.{{sfn|Rupp|1989|p=292}} He took part in the [[Army–McCarthy hearings|McCarthy hearings]]{{sfn|Pearson|1954|p=4}} and Stevens, after her marriage to him, moved politically to the right, from her previously socialist leanings.{{sfn|Rupp|1989|p=292}}

From 1951 to 1963, Stevens served as vice-president of the Lucy Stone League,{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}} though she struggled with maintaining militancy. Stevens was not anti-male, rather pro-female. She did not follow a belief that for women to succeed, men had to be omitted; rather, she believed that collaboration with men was essential.{{sfn|Rupp|1989|pp=304–305}} In her last years, Stevens supported the establishment of [[feminist studies]] as a legitimate field of academic inquiry in American universities and tried to establish a Lucy Stone Chair of Feminism at [[Radcliffe College]].{{sfn|Rupp|1989|p=292}}

Stevens died on March 22, 1963 in [[New York City]],{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}} two weeks after having a stroke.{{sfn|''San Antonio Express''|1963|p=10-D}} [[Princeton University]] has an endowed chair in women's studies created by the Doris Stevens Foundation in 1986.{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}}

==Legacy==
In 1986, Princeton University established an endowed chair through the Doris Stevens Foundation in women’s studies.{{sfn|Rupp|1989|p=292}} In 2004 the [[HBO]] film ''[[Iron Jawed Angels]]'' was made about the early days of the suffrage movement. Doris Stevens was portrayed by [[Laura Fraser]].{{sfn|''Iron Jawed Angels''|2004}}

{{Refimprove|date=November 2012}}
'''Ecstasy''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] ἔκστασις ''ekstasis'', "to be or stand outside oneself, a removal to elsewhere" from ''ek-'' "out," and ''stasis'' "a stand, or a standoff of forces") is a term used in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]], [[Christian philosophy|Christian]] and [[Existential philosophy|Existential]] philosophy. The different traditions using the concept have radically different perspectives.

==Ancient Greek philosophy==
According to [[Plotinus]], ecstasy is the culmination of human possibility. He contrasted emanation (πρόοδος, ''prohodos'') from the [[Henology|One]]—on the one hand—with ecstasy or reversion (ἐπιστροφή, ''epistrophe'') back to the One—on the other.

This is a form of ecstasy described as the vision of, or union with, some otherworldly entity (see [[religious ecstasy]])—a form of ecstasy that pertains to an individual trancelike experience of the sacred or of God.

==Christian mysticism==
[[File:Estasi di Santa Teresa.jpg|250px|right|thumb|''Ecstasy of Saint Teresa'', 1652, by [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]]]]
Among the [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystics]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[Teresa of Ávila]] had mystical experiences of ecstasy, or talked about ecstatic visions of God.

==Existential philosophy==

The term is currently used in philosophy usually to mean "outside-itself". One's consciousness, for example, is not self-enclosed, as  one can be conscious of an [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] person, who falls well outside one's own self. In a sense consciousness is usually, "outside itself," in that its object (what it thinks about, or perceives) is not itself. This is in contrast to the term '''[[wiktionary:enstasis|enstasis]]''' which means from "standing-within-oneself" which relates to [[theoria|contemplation]] from the perspective of a speculator.&lt;ref&gt;J. Glenn Friesen, [http://www.members.shaw.ca/aevum/Enstasy.pdf "Enstasy, Ecstasy and Religious Self-reflection"], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

This understanding of enstasis gives way to the example of the use of the "ecstasy" as that one can be "outside of oneself" with time. In temporalizing, each of the following: the past (the 'having-been'), the future (the 'not-yet') and the present (the 'making-present') are the "outside of itself" of each other. The term ecstasy ({{lang-de|Ekstase}}) has been used in this sense by [[Martin Heidegger]] who, in his ''[[Being and Time]]'' of 1927, argued that our [[being-in-the-world]] is usually focused toward some person, task, or the past (see also [[existence]] and ''[[Dasein]]''). Telling someone to "remain in the present" could then be self-contradictory, if the present only emerged as the "outside itself" of future possibilities (our projection; ''{{lang|de|Entwurf}}'') and past facts (our [[Facticity#Heidegger|thrownness]]; ''{{lang|de|Geworfenheit}}'').&lt;ref&gt;As [[existentialist]] scholar [[Alphonso Lingis]] writes: "Existential philosophy defined the new concepts of ecstasy or of transcendence to fix a distinct kind of being that is by casting itself out of its own given place and time, without dissipating, because at each moment it projects itself — or, more exactly, a variant of itself — into another place and time. Such a being is not ideality, defined as intuitable or reconstitutable anywhere and at any moment. ''Ex-istence,'' understood etymologically, is not so much a state or a stance as a movement, which is by conceiving a divergence from itself or a potentiality of itself and casting itself into that divergence with all that it is." —Lingis, Alphonso. "The Imperative," Indiana University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmanuel Levinas]] disagreed with Heidegger's position regarding ecstasy and existential temporality from the perspective of the experience of insomnia.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin, Dachun Yang, Linyu Gu (eds), [https://books.google.com/books?id=p3y64bw5kr8C&amp;dq= ''Levinas: Chinese and Western Perspectives''], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Levinas talked of the Other in terms of 'insomnia' and 'wakefulness'.&lt;ref&gt;A-T. Tymieniecka (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iGONF4dUwOwC&amp;dq= ''Phenomenology World Wide''], Springer, 2003, p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized the absolute otherness of the Other and established a social relationship between the Other and one's self.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin ''et al'' (eds), 2009, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he asserted that ecstasy, or exteriority toward the Other, forever remains beyond any attempt at full capture; this otherness is interminable or infinite.&lt;ref&gt;Sociality is a "relation ... to the infinite" (E. Levinas, ''Le temps et l'autre'', Presses universitaires de France, 1991, p. 8). The "relation with the Other" [''rapport à autrui''] is one among the "inevitable articulations of the transcendence of time" [''articulations ... inévitables de la transcendance du temps''] which are "neither ecstasy where the Same is absorbed in(to) the Other nor knowledge where the Other belongs to the Same" [''ni extase où le Même s'absorbe dans l'Autre ni savoir où l'Autre appartient au Même''] (''ibid''., p. 13).&lt;/ref&gt; This "infiniteness" of the Other would allow Levinas to derive other aspects of philosophy as secondary to this ethic. Levinas writes:
{{quote|text=The others that obsess me in the other do not affect me as examples of the same genus united with my neighbor by resemblance or common nature, [[individuation]]s of the human race, or chips off the old block... The others concern me from the first. Here fraternity precedes the commonness of a [[genus]]. My relationship with the Other as neighbor gives meaning to my relations with all the others.&lt;ref&gt;E. Levinas, ''Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence'', 1981, Springer, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other uses of the term==
The term 'ecstasy' is also used concomitantly by philosophers to refer to a heightened state of pleasure or area of consciousness that may have been ignored by other theorists; to sexual experiences with another person, or as a general state of intense emotional [[ecstasy (emotion)|rapture]]. These may include [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], intense consciousness toward another, or extraordinary physical connections to others.

The '''experience machine''' or '''pleasure machine''' is a thought experiment put forward by  philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] in his 1974 book  ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nozick | first = Robert | title = Anarchy, state, and utopia | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 1974 | isbn = 0-465-09720-0 | pages = 42–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the best known attempts to refute ethical [[hedonism]], and does so by imagining a choice between everyday reality and an apparently preferable [[simulated reality]].

If the primary thesis of hedonism is that "pleasure is the good", then any component of life that is not pleasurable does nothing directly to increase one's [[well-being]]. This is a view held by many value theorists, but most famously by some classical [[Utilitarianism|utilitarians]]. Nozick attacks the thesis by means of a [[thought experiment]]. If he can show that there is something other than pleasure that has value and thereby increases our well-being, then hedonism is defeated.

==The thought experiment==
Nozick asks us to imagine a machine that could give us whatever desirable or pleasurable experiences we could want. Psychologists have figured out a way to stimulate a person's brain to induce pleasurable experiences that the subject could not distinguish from those he would have apart from the machine. He then asks, if given the choice, would we prefer the machine to real life?

Nozick also believes that if pleasure were the only intrinsic value, people would have an overriding reason to be hooked up to an "experience machine," which would produce favorable sensations.

===Initial concerns===
Who would run the machines if everyone plugs in? Nozick asks us to ignore this concern, since it does not adversely affect the thought experiment. One could simply stipulate that the machines have been so well designed as to be fail-proof.

The experiment is also open to multiple interpretations. For instance, Nozick claims that you could either map out the rest of your life in the machine before plugging in, or you could unplug periodically to choose your programming for the next cycle. While interesting, these variations do not directly affect the argument.

===The argument===
The argument is along these lines:

*P1: If experiencing as much pleasure as we can is all that matters to us, then if we will experience more pleasure by doing x than by doing y, we have no reason not to do x rather than y.
*P2: We will experience more pleasure if we plug into the experience machine than if we do not plug into the experience machine.
*C1: If all that matters to us is that we experience as much pleasure as we can then we have no reason not to plug into the experience machine. (P1&amp;P2)
*P3: We have reason not to plug into the experience machine.
*C2: Experiencing as much pleasure as we can is not all that matters to us. (C1&amp;P3, by [[Modus tollens|MT]])

===Reasons not to plug in===
Nozick provides us with three reasons not to plug into the machine.

# ''We want to'' do ''certain things, and not just have the experience of doing them.''
#* "It is only because we first want to do the actions that we want the experiences of doing them." (Nozick, 43)
# ''We want to'' be ''a certain sort of person.''
#* "Someone floating in a tank is an indeterminate blob." (Nozick, 43)
# ''Plugging into an experience machine limits us to a man-made reality (it limits us to what we can make).''
#* "There is no ''actual'' contact with any deeper reality, though the experience of it can be simulated." (Nozick, 43)

===Counterarguments===
Psychologist Felipe de Brigard says that our intuitions about the experience machine may be affected by [[status quo bias]], and suggests reformulating the thought experiment in a form which counters this.&lt;ref name="Lazari-RadekSinger2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek|author2=[[Peter Singer]]|title=The Point of View of the Universe: Sidgwick and Contemporary Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2NeAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257|date=22 May 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-102242-5|pages=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his version:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
you wake up in a plain white room. You are seated in a reclining chair with a steel contraption on your head. A woman in a white coat is standing over you. 'The year is 2659,' she explains, 'The life with which you are familiar is an experience machine program selected by you some forty years ago. We at IEM interrupt our client's programs at ten-year intervals to ensure client satisfaction. Our records indicate that at your three previous interruptions you deemed your program satisfactory and chose to continue. As before, if you choose to continue with your program you will return to your life as you know it with no recollection of this interruption. Your friends, loved ones, and projects will all be there. Of course, you may choose to terminate your program at this point if you are unsatisfied for any reason. Do you intend to continue with your program?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
If we feel differently about this version of the story compared to the form that Nozick offers, according to de Brigard this is due to [[status quo bias]].&lt;ref name="Lazari-RadekSinger2014"/&gt;

==In fiction==
{{See also|Simulated reality in fiction}}
Before it became a philosophical thought experiment in the mid seventies, the pleasurable but simulated experience versus reality dilemma had been a staple of science fiction; for example in the short story "[[The Chamber of Life]]" by [[Green Peyton Wertenbaker]] ([[:fr:Green Peyton Wertenbaker|fr]]) , published in the magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in October 1929. The novel ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' by [[David Foster Wallace]] involves a similar formulation of the experience machine. The novel revolves around a film titled ''Infinite Jest'' that is lethally pleasurable: the film is so entertaining that, once watched, the viewer will desire nothing else but to watch the film over and over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sloane |first=Peter |year=2014 |title=The Divided Selves of David Foster Wallace |journal=Tropos |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=67-73 |doi=10.14324/111.2057-2212.011 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1420208/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of movies centering on machines capable of replaying experiences previously recorded include the 1983 film ''[[Brainstorm (1983 film)|Brainstorm]]'' and the 1995 film ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]''.&lt;ref name="Baggott2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jim Baggott]]|title=A Beginner's Guide to Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9yAa7kRYiUkC&amp;pg=PT137|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-104232-9|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also is a running theme of the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]''.&lt;ref name="Grau2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Grau|title=Philosophers Explore The Matrix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Pmld5FXZ0YC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518107-4|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agent Smith]]'s account of the early history of the Matrix includes the idea that humans reject a virtual reality that offers them paradise; however, later his informant  [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Mr. Reagan.2FCypher|Cypher]] is willing to betray his colleagues because he would prefer to be reinserted into an (arguably less perfect) Matrix as a wealthy and successful man than continue to live in the harsh realities outside the simulation. While this later version of the Matrix is not a paradise-like reality in the literal sense, it may be argued that it is a lot like a pleasure-inducing Experience Machine, since Cypher is given the opportunity to have a prominent position of power and wealth in this new simulation. As he says while dining at a simulated restaurant: &lt;blockquote&gt;"You know, I know this steak doesn't exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy, and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize? Ignorance is bliss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Certainty}}

'''Fatalism''' is a [[philosophical]] doctrine that stresses the subjugation of all events or actions to [[destiny]]. 

Fatalism generally refers to any of the following ideas:
* The view that we are powerless to do anything other than what we actually do.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fatalism/|title=Fatalism|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]|author=Hugh Rice|date=October 11, 2010|accessdate=December 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included in this is that humans have no power to influence the future, or indeed, their own actions.&lt;ref name="jstor"/&gt; This belief is very similar to [[predeterminism]].
* An attitude of resignation in the face of some future event or events which are thought to be inevitable. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] named this idea "Turkish fatalism"&lt;ref&gt;[http://metheus.eu/kutuphane/turk-kaderciligi Metheus]&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''[[The Wanderer and His Shadow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, The Wanderer and His Shadow, 1880, Türkenfatalismus&lt;/ref&gt;
* That acceptance is appropriate, rather than resistance against inevitability. This belief is very similar to [[defeatism]].
* Some take it to mean [[determinism]].

== Antiquity ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2016}}
[[Ājīvika]] (also written Ajivika or Ajivaka, literally meaning "living" in Sanskrit) was a system of ancient [[Indian philosophy]] and an ascetic movement of the [[Mahajanapada]] period in the Indian subcontinent. Ājīvika followers believed that a cycle of reincarnation of the soul was determined by a precise and non-personal cosmic principle called ''niyati'' (destiny or fate) that was completely independent of the person's actions. The same sources therefore make them out to be strict fatalists, who did not believe in [[karma]].
"If all future occurrences are rigidly determined ..., coming events may in some sense be said to exist already. The future exists in the present, and both exist in the past. Time is thus on ultimate analysis illusory". "Every phase of a process is always present. ... in a soul which has attained salvation its earthly births are still present. Nothing is destroyed and nothing is produced. ... Not only are all things determined, but their change and development is a cosmic illusion."{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} [[Makkhali Gosala]] (Pāli; BHS: Maskarin Gośāla; Jain Prakrit sources: Gosala Mankhaliputta) was an [[ascetic]] teacher of ancient India. He is regarded to have been born in 484 BCE and was a contemporary of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the founder of [[Buddhism]], and of [[Mahavira]], the last and 24th Tirthankara of [[Jainism]].

==Determinism and predeterminism==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2016}}
While the terms are often used interchangeably, fatalism, [[determinism]], and [[predeterminism]] are discrete in stressing different aspects of the futility of human will or the foreordination of destiny. However, all these doctrines share common ground.

''Determinists'' generally agree that human actions affect the future but that human action is itself determined by a causal chain of prior events. Their view does not accentuate a "submission" to fate or destiny, whereas ''fatalists'' stress an acceptance of future events as inevitable. Determinists believe the future is fixed specifically due to [[causality]]; fatalists and predeterminists believe that some or all aspects of the future are inescapable, but, for fatalists, not necessarily due to causality.

Fatalism is a looser term than determinism. The presence of historical "indeterminisms" or chances, i.e. events that could not be predicted by sole knowledge of other events, is an idea still compatible with fatalism. Necessity (such as a law of nature) will happen just as inevitably as a chance—both can be imagined as sovereign.

Likewise, determinism is a broader term than predeterminism. ''Predeterminists'', as a specific type of determinists, believe that every single event or effect is caused by an uninterrupted chain of events that goes back to the origin of the universe. Determinists, holding a more generic view, meanwhile, believe that each event is at least caused by recent prior events, if not also by such far-extending and unbroken events as those going back in time to the universe's very origins.

Fatalism, by referring to the personal "fate" or to "predestined events" strongly imply the existence of a ''someone'' or ''something'' that has set the "predestination." This is usually interpreted to mean a conscious, [[omniscient]] being or force who has personally planned—and therefore knows at all times—the exact succession of every event in the past, present, and future, none of which can be altered.

==Idle Argument==
One famous ancient argument regarding fatalism was the so-called [[Lazy argument|''Idle Argument'']]. It argues that if something is fated, then it would be pointless or futile to make any effort to bring it about. The Idle Argument was described by [[Origen]] and [[Cicero]] and it went like this:

*If it is [[destiny|fate]]d for you to recover from this illness, then you will recover whether you call a doctor or not.
*Likewise, if you are fated not to recover, you will not do so whether you call a doctor or not.
*But either it is fated that you will recover from this illness, or it is fated that you will not recover.
*Therefore, it is futile to consult a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Origen ''Contra Celsum'' II 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Fato'' 28-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The Idle Argument was anticipated by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[De Interpretatione]]'' chapter 9. The [[Stoics]] considered it to be a [[sophism]] and the Stoic [[Chrysippus]] attempted to refute it by pointing out that consulting the doctor would be as much fated as recovering. He seems to have introduced the idea that in cases like that at issue two events can be ''co-fated'', so that one cannot occur without the other.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien]], ''Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, a false argument because it fails to consider that those fated to recover may be those fated to consult a doctor.

==Logical fatalism and the argument from bivalence==
Another famous argument for fatalism that goes back to antiquity is one that depends not on causation or physical circumstances but rather is based on presumed [[logical truth]]s. There are numerous versions of this argument, including those by [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ball0888/salamis/interpretatione.html Aristotle, De Interpretatione, 9]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Taylor (philosopher)|Richard Taylor]].&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fatalism|author=Richard Taylor|journal=The Philosophical Review|volume=71|number=1|date=January 1962|pages=56–66|publisher=Duke University Press|jstor=2183681}}&lt;/ref&gt; These have been objected to and elaborated on&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt; but do not enjoy mainstream support.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The key idea of logical fatalism is that there is a body of true propositions (statements) about what is going to happen, and these are true regardless of when they are made. So, for example, if it is true today that tomorrow there will be a sea battle, then there cannot fail to be a sea battle tomorrow, since otherwise it would not be true today that such a battle will take place tomorrow.

The argument relies heavily on the [[principle of bivalence]]: the idea that any proposition is either true or false.  As a result of this principle, if it is not false that there will be a sea battle, then it is true; there is no in-between.  However, rejecting the principle of bivalence—perhaps by saying that the truth of a proposition regarding the future is indeterminate—is a controversial view since the principle is an accepted part of [[classical logic]].

==Criticism==
===Semantic equivocation===
The basic logical structure of logical fatalism is criticized as false. The structure of its argument is "Either a certain event happens or it doesn't happen. If it happens, there is nothing to be done to prevent it. If it doesn't happen, there is nothing to be done to enable it." The problem in the argument arises with the semantics of "if". The argument fails because it uses "if" to imply that the event will happen with absolute certainty, when there is only certainty that the event ''either'' happens ''or'' doesn't, when both options are considered. Neither option by itself is certain, even though both options together are certain. The use of the word "if" in this way frames the sentence as "if the event is certain to happen, then there is nothing to be done to prevent it", but there is no certainty that the event will happen. Thus this type of fatalism relies on [[circular reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|publisher=Clarendon Press Oxford|year=1996|pages=352-358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism comes from the novelist [[David Foster Wallace]], who in a 1985 paper "[[Richard Taylor (philosopher)|Richard Taylor]]'s ''Fatalism'' and the Semantics of Physical Modality" suggests that Taylor reached his conclusion of fatalism only because his argument involved two different and inconsistent notions of impossibility.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Consider the Philosopher|first=James|last=Ryerson|date=December 12, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/magazine/14wwln-Wallace-t.html|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace did not reject fatalism ''per se'', as he wrote in his closing passage, "if Taylor and the fatalists want to force upon us a metaphysical conclusion, they must do metaphysics, not semantics. And this seems entirely appropriate."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Willem deVries and Jay Garfield, both of whom were advisers on Wallace’s thesis, expressed regret that Wallace never published his argument.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; In 2010, the thesis was, however, published posthumously as ''Time, Fate, and Language: An Essay on Free Will''.

{{More citations needed|date=September 2008}}In [[solid-state physics]], the '''free electron model''' is a simple model for the behaviour of [[charge carrier]]s in a [[metal]]lic solid. It was developed in 1927,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sommerfeld|first=Arnold|author-link=Arnold Sommerfeld|date=1928-01-01|title=Zur Elektronentheorie der Metalle auf Grund der Fermischen Statistik|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik|language=de|volume=47|issue=1–2|pages=1–32|doi=10.1007/bf01391052|issn=0044-3328|bibcode=1928ZPhy...47....1S}}&lt;/ref&gt; principally by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] who combined the [[Classical physics|classical]] [[Drude model]] with [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] and hence it is also known as the '''Drude–Sommerfeld model'''.

Given its simplicity, it is surprisingly successful in explaining many experimental phenomena, especially
* the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]] which relates [[electrical conductivity]] and [[thermal conductivity]];
* the temperature dependence of the [[electron heat capacity]];
* the shape of the electronic [[density of states]];
* the range of binding energy values;
* electrical conductivities;
* the [[Seebeck coefficient]] of the [[thermoelectric effect]];
* [[thermionic emission|thermal electron emission]] and [[field electron emission]] from bulk metals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The free electron model solved many of the inconsistencies related to the Drude model and gave insight into several other properties of metals. The model considers that metals are composed of a quantum electron gas where [[ion]]s play almost no role. The model can be very predictive when applied to [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[noble metal]]s.

==Ideas and assumptions==

In the free electron model four main assumptions are taken into account:
*Free electron approximation: The interaction between the ions and the valence electrons is mostly neglected, except in boundary conditions. The ions only keep the charge neutrality in the metal. Unlike in the Drude model, the ions are not necessarily the source of collisions.
*[[Independent electron approximation]]: The interactions between electrons are ignored. The electrostatic fields in metals are weak because of the [[screening effect]].
*Relaxation-time approximation: There is some unknown scattering mechanism such that the electron probability of collision is inversely proportional to the relaxation time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, which represents the average time between collisions. The collisions do not depend on the electronic configuration.
*[[Pauli exclusion principle]]: Each quantum state of the system can only be occupied by a single electron. This restriction of available electron states is taken into account by [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] (see also [[Fermi gas]]). Main predictions of the free-electron model are derived by the [[Sommerfeld expansion]] of the Fermi–Dirac occupancy for energies around the [[Fermi level]].

The name of the model comes from the first two assumptions, as each electron can be treated as [[free particle]] with a respective quadratic relation between energy and momentum.

The crystal lattice is not explicitly taken into account in the free electron model, but a quantum-mechanical justification was given a year later (1928) by [[Bloch wave|Bloch's theorem]]:&lt;!-- Is this Bloch theorem? We must check the validity of this paragraph --&gt; an unbound electron moves in a periodic potential as a free electron in vacuum, except for the [[electron mass]] ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' becoming an [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] ''m*'' which may deviate considerably from ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' (one can even use negative effective mass to describe conduction by [[electron hole]]s). Effective masses can be derived from [[band structure]] computations that were not originally taken into account in the free electron model.

== From the Drude model ==
{{main|Drude model}}
Many physical properties follow directly from the Drude model as some equations do not depend on the statistical distribution of the particles. Taking the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution#Distribution for the velocity vector|classical velocity distribution]] of an ideal gas or the velocity distribution of a Fermi gas only changes the results related to the speed of the electrons.

Mainly, the free electron model and the Drude model predict the same DC electrical conductivity ''σ'' for [[Ohm's law]], that is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E}\quad&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\quad\sigma = \frac{ne^2\tau}{m_e},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[current density]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the external electric field, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electronic density]] (number of electrons/volume) and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge|electron electric charge]].&lt;!-- , and  &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron rest mass|electron mass]]. To include if paragraph above about Bloch's theorem disappears --&gt;

Other quantities that remain the same under the free electron model as under Drude's are the AC susceptibility, the [[plasma oscillation|plasma frequency]],  the [[magnetoresistance]], and the Hall coefficient related to the [[Hall effect]].

== Properties of an electron gas ==
{{main|Fermi gas}}
Many properties of the free electron model follow directly from equations related to the Fermi gas, as the independent electron approximation leads to an ensemble of non-interacting electrons. For a three-dimensional electron gas we can define the [[Fermi energy]] as
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm F} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\left(3\pi^2n\right)^\frac{2}{3},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced [[Planck constant]]. The Fermi energy defines the [[Fermi level]], ''i.e.'' the maximal energy an electron in the metal can have at zero temperature. For metals the Fermi energy is in the order of units of [[electronvolt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/fermi.html|title=Fermi Energies, Fermi Temperatures, and Fermi Velocities|last=Nave|first=Rod|date=|website=|publisher=[[HyperPhysics]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Free-electron DOS.svg|thumb|In three dimensions, the [[density of states]] of a gas of [[fermion]]s is proportional to the square root of the kinetic energy of the particles.]]

=== Density of states ===
The 3D [[density of states]] (number of energy states, per energy per volume) of a non-interacting electron gas is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;g(E) = \frac{m_e}{\pi^2\hbar^3}\sqrt{2m_eE} = \frac{3}{2}\frac{n}{E_{\rm F}}\sqrt{\frac{E}{E_{\rm F}}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;E \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of a given electron. This formula takes into account the spin degeneracy but does not consider a possible energy shift due to the bottom of the [[Valence and conduction bands|conduction band]]. For 2D the density of states is constant and for 1D is inversely proportional to the square root of the electron energy.

=== Chemical potential ===
Additionally the Fermi energy is used to define [[chemical potential]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;. [[Sommerfeld expansion]] is a technique used to calculate the chemical potential for higher energies, that is
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(T) = E_{\rm F} \left[1 - \frac{\pi ^2}{12} \left(\frac{T}{T_{\rm F}}\right) ^2 - \frac{\pi^4}{80} \left(\frac{T}{T_{\rm F}}\right)^4 + \cdots \right], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature and we define &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T_{\rm F} = E_{\rm F}/k_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt; as the [[Fermi temperature]] (&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann constant]]). The perturbative approach is justified as the Fermi temperature is usually of about 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; K for a metal, hence at room temperature or lower the Fermi energy and the chemical potential are practically equivalent.

=== Compressibility of metals and degeneracy pressure ===
The total energy per unit volume (at &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T = 0&lt;/math&gt;) can also be calculated by integrating over the [[phase space]] of the system, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;u(0) = \frac{3}{5}nE_{\rm F},&lt;/math&gt;

which does not depend on temperature. Compare with the energy per electron of an ideal gas: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{3}{2}k_{\rm B}T&lt;/math&gt;, which is null at zero temperature. For an ideal gas to have the same energy as the electron gas, the temperatures would need to be of the order of the Fermi temperature. Thermodynamically, this energy of the electron gas corresponds to a zero-temperature pressure given by
: &lt;math&gt;P = -\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_{T,\mu} = \frac{2}{3}u(0),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U(T) = u(T) V&lt;/math&gt; is the total energy, the derivative performed at temperature and chemical potential constant. This pressure is called the [[electron degeneracy pressure]] and does not come from repulsion or motion of the electrons but from the restriction that no more than two electrons (due to the two values of spin) can occupy the same energy level. This pressure defines the compressibility or [[bulk modulus]] of the metal
:&lt;math&gt;B = -V\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_{T,\mu} = \frac{5}{3}P = \frac{2}{3}nE_{\rm F}.&lt;/math&gt;

This expression gives the right order of magnitude for the bulk modulus for alkali metals and noble metals, which show that this pressure is as important as other effects inside the metal. For other metals the crystalline structure has to be taken into account.

== Additional predictions ==

=== Heat capacity ===
{{See|Electron heat capacity}}
One open problem in solid-state physics before the arrival of the free electron model was related to the low [[heat capacity]] of metals. Even when the Drude model was a good approximation for the Lorenz number of the Wiedemann-Franz law, the classical argument is based on the idea that the [[volumetric heat capacity]] of an ideal gas is
:&lt;math&gt;c^\text{Drude}_V = \frac{3}{2}nk_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt;.

If this was the case, the heat capacity of a metal could be much higher due to this electronic contribution. Nevertheless, such a large heat capacity was never measured, rising suspicions about the argument. By using Sommerfeld's expansion one can obtain corrections of the energy density at finite temperature and obtain the volumetric heat capacity of an electron gas, given by:
:&lt;math&gt;c_V=\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial T}\right)_{n}=\frac{\pi^2}{2}\frac{T}{T_{\rm F}} nk_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt;,

where the prefactor to &lt;math&gt;nk_B&lt;/math&gt;is considerably smaller than the 3/2 found in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c^{\text{Drude}}_V&lt;/math&gt;, about 100 times smaller at room temperature and much smaller at lower &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. The good estimation of the Lorenz number in the Drude model was a result of the classical mean velocity of electron being about 100 larger than the quantum version, compensating the large value of the classical heat capacity. The free electron model calculation of the Lorenz factor is about twice the value of Drude's and its closer to the experimental value. With this heat capacity the free electron model is also able to predict the right order of magnitude and temperature dependence at low ''T'' for the [[Seebeck coefficient]] of the [[thermoelectric effect]].

Evidently, the electronic contribution alone does not predict the [[Dulong–Petit law]], i.e. the observation that the heat capacity of a metal is constant at high temperatures. The free electron model can be improved in this sense by adding the lattice vibrations contribution. Two famous schemes to include the lattice into the problem are the [[Einstein solid]] model and [[Debye model]]. With the addition of the later, the volumetric heat capacity of a metal at low temperatures can be more precisely written in the form, 
:&lt;math&gt;c_V\approx\gamma T + AT^3&lt;/math&gt;, 
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are constants of related to the material. The linear term comes from the electronic contribution while the cubic term comes from Debye model. At high temperature this expression is no longer correct, the electronic heat capacity can be neglected, and the total heat capacity of the metal tends to a constant.

=== Mean free path ===
Notice that without the relaxation time approximation, there is no reason for the electrons to deflect their motion, as there are no interactions, thus the [[mean free path]] should be infinite. Drude model considered the mean free path of electrons to be close to the distance between ions in the material, implying the earlier conclusion that the [[Diffusion|diffusive motion]] of the electrons was due to collisions with the ions. The mean free paths in the free electron model are instead given by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lambda=v_{\rm F}\tau&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;v_{\rm F}=\sqrt{2E_{\rm F}/m_e}&lt;/math&gt; is the Fermi speed) and are in the order of hundreds of [[ångström]]s, at least one order of magnitude larger than any possible classical calculation. The mean free path is then not a result electron-ion collisions but instead is related to imperfections in the material, either due to [[Crystallographic defect|defects]] and impurities in the metal, or due to thermal fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unlcms.unl.edu/cas/physics/tsymbal/teaching/SSP-927/Section%2008_Electron_Transport.pdf|title=Electronic Transport|last=Tsymbal|first=Evgeny|date=2008|website=University of Nebraska-Lincoln|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inaccuracies and extensions==
The free electron model presents several inadequacies that are contradicted by experimental observation. We list some inaccuracies below:
; Temperature dependence: The free electron model presents several physical quantities that have the wrong temperature dependence, or no dependence at all like the electrical conductivity. The thermal conductivity and specific heat are well predicted for alkali metals at low temperatures, but fails to predict high temperature behaviour coming from ion motion and [[phonon]] scattering.
; Hall effect and magnetoresistance:The Hall coefficient has a constant value {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} -1/(''ne'')}} in Drude's model and in the free electron model. This value is independent of temperature and the strength of the magnetic field. The Hall coefficient is actually dependent on the [[band structure]] and the difference with the model can be quite dramatic when studying elements like [[magnesium]] and [[aluminium]] that have a strong magnetic field dependence. The free electron model also predicts that the traverse magnetoresistance, the resistance in the direction of the current, does not depend on the strength of the field. In almost all the cases it does.
; Directional: The conductivity of some metals can depend of the orientation of the sample with respect to the electric field. Sometimes even the electrical current is not parallel to the field.  This possibility is not described because the model does not integrate the crystallinity of metals, i.e. the existence of a periodic lattice of ions. 
; Diversity in the conductivity: Not all metals are [[electrical conductor]]s,  some do not conduct electricity very well ([[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]]), some can conduct when impurities are added like [[semiconductor]]s. [[Semimetal]]s, with narrow conduction bands also exist. This diversity is not predicted by the model and can only by explained by analysing the [[valence and conduction bands]]. Additionally, electrons are not the only charge carriers in a metal, electron vacancies or [[Electron hole|holes]] can be seen as [[quasiparticle]]s carrying positive electric charge. Conduction of holes leads to an opposite sign for the Hall and Seebeck coefficients predicted by the model.

Other inadequacies are present in the Wiedemann-Franz law at intermediate temperatures and the frequency-dependence of metals in the optical spectrum.

More exact values for the electrical conductivity and Wiedemann-Franz law can be obtained by softening the relaxation-time approximation by appealing to [[Boltzmann equation|Boltzmann transport equations]] or [[Kubo formula]].

The spin is mostly neglected in the free electron model and its consequences can lead to emergent magnetic phenomena like [[Paramagnetism|Pauli paramagnetism]] and [[ferromagnetism]].

An immediate continuation to the free electron model can be obtained by assuming the [[empty lattice approximation]], which forms the basis of the band structure model known as the [[nearly free electron model]].

Adding repulsive interactions between electrons does not change very much the picture presented here. [[Lev Landau]] showed that a Fermi gas under repulsive interactions, can be seen as a gas of equivalent quasiparticles that slightly modify the properties of the metal. Landau's model is now known as the [[Fermi liquid theory]]. More exotic phenomena like [[superconductivity]], where interactions can be attractive, require a more refined theory.

{{Prerogative writs}}
'''''Habeas corpus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|b|i|ə|s|_|ˈ|k|ɔr|p|ə|s}}; [[Medieval Latin]] meaning literally "that you have the body")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=habeas corpus|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habeas%20corpus|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Legal recourse|recourse in law]] through which a person can report an [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|unlawful detention or imprisonment]] to a [[court]] and request that the court order the custodian of the person, usually a prison official, to bring the prisoner to court, to determine whether the detention is lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is Habeas Corpus|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/habeas_corpus.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=English|date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' is known as "the great and efficacious writ in all manner of illegal confinement".&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;per Blackstone&lt;/ref&gt; It is a summons with the force of a [[court order]]; it is addressed to the custodian (a prison official, for example) and demands that a prisoner be taken before the court, and that the custodian present proof of authority, allowing the court to determine whether the custodian has lawful authority to detain the prisoner. If the custodian is acting beyond his or her authority, then the prisoner must be released. Any prisoner, or another person acting on his or her behalf, may petition the court, or a judge, for a writ of ''habeas corpus''. One reason for the writ to be sought by a person other than the prisoner is that the detainee might be held [[Solitary confinement|incommunicado]]. Most [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions provide a similar remedy for those unlawfully detained, but this is not always called ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution|first=Albert|last=Venn Dicey|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kz40AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=INTRODUCTION+TO+THE+STUDY+OF+THE+LAW+OF+THE+CONSTITUTION+A.+V.+Dicey|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in some Spanish-speaking nations, the equivalent remedy for unlawful imprisonment is the ''[[amparo de libertad]]'' ("protection of freedom").

''Habeas corpus'' has certain limitations. Though a writ of right, it is not a writ of course.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The applicant must make out a ''prima facie'' case. However, once that is done, the applicant is entitled to the writ as of right, which is then granted ''ex debito justitae'' ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right)&lt;/ref&gt; It is technically only a procedural [[legal remedy|remedy]]; it is a guarantee against any detention that is forbidden by law, but it does not necessarily protect other rights, such as the entitlement to a fair trial. So if an imposition such as internment without trial is permitted by the law, then ''habeas corpus'' may not be a useful remedy. In some countries, the writ has been temporarily or permanently suspended under the pretext of war or [[state of emergency]].{{elucidate|date=February 2016}}

The right to petition for a writ of ''habeas corpus'' has nonetheless long been celebrated as the most efficient safeguard of the liberty of the subject. The jurist [[Albert Venn Dicey]] wrote that the British [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Acts]] "declare no principle and define no rights, but they are for practical purposes worth a hundred constitutional articles guaranteeing individual liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Wright (1994) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I7oOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=declare+no+principle+and+define+no+rights,+but+they+are+for+practical+purposes+worth+a+hundred+constitutional+articles+guaranteeing+individual+liberty&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#v=onepage&amp;q=declare%20no%20principle%20and%20define%20no%20rights%2C%20but%20they%20are%20for%20practical%20purposes%20worth%20a%20hundred%20constitutional%20articles%20guaranteeing%20individual%20liberty ''Citizens and subjects: an essay on British politics''], Routledge, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' is one of what are called the "extraordinary", "[[common law]]", or "[[prerogative writ]]s", which were historically issued by the [[English courts]] in the name of the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are ''[[quo warranto]]'', ''[[prohibito]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''[[procedendo]]'', and ''[[certiorari]]''. The due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority. The official who is the respondent must prove his authority to do or not do something. Failing this, the court must decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. This differs from a motion in a civil process in which the movant must have standing, and bears the burden of proof.

==Etymology==
From Latin ''habeas'', 2nd person singular present [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] active of ''habere'', "to have", "to hold"; and ''corpus'', accusative singular of ''corpus'', "body". In reference to more than one person, ''habeas corpora''.

Literally, the phrase means "[we command] that you should have the [detainee's] body [brought to court]". The complete phrase ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' means "that you have the person for the purpose of subjecting him/her to (examination)". These are the opening words of writs in 14th century Anglo-French documents requiring a person to be brought before a court or judge, especially to determine if that person is being legally detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=habeas corpus |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=habeas%20corpus |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarly named writs===
The full name of the writ is often used to distinguish it from similar ancient writs, also named ''habeas corpus''. These include:
* ''Habeas corpus ad deliberandum et recipiendum'': a writ for bringing an accused from a different county into a court in the place where a crime had been committed for purposes of trial, or more literally to return holding the body for purposes of "deliberation and receipt" of a decision. ("[[Extradition]]")
* ''Habeas corpus ad faciendum et recipiendum'' (also called ''habeas corpus cum causa''): a writ of a superior court to a custodian to return with the body being held by the order of a lower court "with reasons", for the purpose of "receiving" the decision of the superior court and of "doing" what it ordered.
* ''Habeas corpus ad prosequendum'': a writ ordering return with a prisoner for the purpose of "prosecuting" him before the court.
* ''Habeas corpus ad respondendum'': a writ ordering return to allow the prisoner to "answer" to new proceedings before the court.
* ''Habeas corpus ad testificandum'': a writ ordering return with the body of a prisoner for the purposes of "testifying".

==Origins in England==
{{further|English law}}
''Habeas corpus'' originally stems from the [[Assize of Clarendon]], a re-issuance of rights during the reign of [[Henry II of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/assizecl.asp |title=Assize of Clarendon, 1166. |date=1 December 1998 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, the foundations for ''habeas corpus'' were "wrongly thought" to have originated in [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Ralph V. ''Magna Carta'' Pearson (2003) p162 and p219&lt;/ref&gt; This charter declared that:{{quote|No [[Estates of the realm|Freeman]] shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseized of his [[Freehold (law)|Freehold]], or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the land.}}

[[William Blackstone]] cites the first recorded usage of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' in 1305, during the reign of [[Edward I of England|King Edward&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, other [[writ]]s were issued with the same effect as early as the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;II]] in the 12th century. Blackstone explained the basis of the writ, saying "[t]he king is at all times entitled to have an account, why the liberty of any of his subjects is restrained, wherever that restraint may be inflicted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackstone |first1=William |title=Commentaries on the Laws of England: A Facsimile of the First Edition of 1765-1769, vol. 3, pp. 129-37 |date=1768 |publisher=University of Chicago Press (1979), reproduced in ''The Founders' Constitution,'' Volume 3, Article 1, Section 9, Clause 2, Document 4 |location=Chicago |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_9_2s4.html |accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure for issuing a writ of ''habeas corpus'' was first codified by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]], following judicial rulings which had restricted the effectiveness of the writ. A previous law (the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]]) had been passed forty years earlier to overturn a ruling that the command of the King was a sufficient answer to a petition of ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Maxwell. [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/canbarev18&amp;div=24 Habeas Corpus Cum Causa-The Emergence of the Modern Writ-II.] Can. B. Rev. 18 (1940): 172, 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone purpose of the &lt;nowiki&gt;''writ of habeas corpus'' was to limit the King's Chancery's ability to undermine the surety of law by allowing courts of justice decisions to be overturned in favor and application of ''equity'', a process managed by the Chancelor (a bishop) with the King'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/public_education/05_mar08_habeascorpus_landman.pdf|title=Understanding Habeas Corpus|last=Landman|first=James|date=|website=American Bar Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1679 codification of ''habeas corpus'' took place in the context of a [[Exclusion crisis|sharp confrontation]] between King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the [[British Parliament|Parliament]], which was dominated by the then sharply oppositional, nascent [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]]. The Whig leaders had good reasons to fear the King moving against them through the courts (as indeed happened in 1681) and regarded ''habeas corpus'' as safeguarding their own persons. The short-lived Parliament which made this enactment came to be known as the ''[[Habeas Corpus Parliament]]'' - being dissolved by the King immediately afterwards.

Then, as now, the writ of ''habeas corpus'' was issued by a superior court in the name of the Sovereign, and commanded the addressee (a lower court, sheriff, or private subject) to produce the prisoner before the royal courts of law. A ''habeas corpus'' petition could be made by the prisoner him or herself or by a third party on his or her behalf and, as a result of the Habeas Corpus Acts, could be made regardless of whether the court was in session, by presenting the petition to a judge. Since the 18th century the writ has also been used in cases of unlawful detention by private individuals, most famously in ''[[Somersett's Case]]'' (1772), where the black slave Somersett was ordered to be freed.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Charles Moncreiff (2006). "The Wit and Wisdom of the Bench and Bar", pp.85–86. The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; During that case, these famous words are said to have been uttered: "The air of England has long been too pure for a slave, and every man is free who breathes it".&lt;ref&gt;George Birkbeck Hil (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2EQCXQ0IbUkC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=The+air+of+England+has+long+been+too+pure+for+a+slave,+and+every+man+is+free+who+breathes+it.&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20air%20of%20England%20has%20long%20been%20too%20pure%20for%20a%20slave%2C%20and%20every%20man%20is%20free%20who%20breathes%20it. Life of Johnson, Volume 3] Kessinger Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Seven Years' War]] and later conflicts, the Writ was used on behalf of soldiers and sailors [[Impressment|pressed]] into military and naval service.&lt;ref&gt;Costello, Kevin, Habeas Corpus and Military and Naval Impressment 1756–1816, The Journal of Legal History 29.2 215 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Habeas Corpus Act 1816]] introduced some changes and expanded the territoriality of the legislation.

The privilege of ''habeas corpus'' has been suspended or restricted several times during [[English history]], most recently during the 18th and 19th centuries. Although internment without trial has been authorised by statute since that time, for example during the two [[World War]]s and the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], the ''habeas corpus'' procedure has in modern times always technically remained available to such internees. However, as ''habeas corpus'' is only a procedural device to examine the lawfulness of a prisoner's detention, so long as the detention is in accordance with an [[Act of Parliament]], the petition for ''habeas corpus'' is unsuccessful. Since the passage of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], the courts have been able to declare an Act of Parliament to be incompatible with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], but such a declaration of incompatibility has no legal effect unless and until it is acted upon by the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200607/jtselect/jtrights/128/12807.htm Joint Committee On Human Rights Sixteenth Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' implies that the prisoner is brought to the court for the legality of the imprisonment to be examined. However, rather than issuing the writ immediately and waiting for the return of the writ by the custodian, modern practice in England is for the original application to be followed by a hearing with both parties present to decide the legality of the detention, without any writ being issued. If the detention is held to be unlawful, the prisoner can usually then be released or [[bail]]ed by order of the court without having to be produced before it. With the development of modern public law, applications for habeas corpus have been to some extent discouraged, in favour of applications for [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;Re (Habeas Corpus) [1996] QB 599; Re B [1991] 1 FLR 106&lt;/ref&gt; The writ, however, maintains its vigour, and was held by the UK Supreme Court to be available in respect of a prisoner captured by British forces in Afghanistan, albeit that the Secretary of State made a valid return to the writ justifying the detention of the claimant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs v Rahmatullah]] [2012] UKSC 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other jurisdictions==
===Australia===
The writ of ''habeas corpus'' as a procedural remedy is part of [[Australia]]'s English law inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, David and Gerard McCoy (1998), "Habeas Corpus" (Federation Press)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[Australian parliament]] passed the [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]]. Some legal experts questioned the constitutionality of the act, due in part to limitations it placed on ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Human Rights Guide to Australia's Counter-Terrorism Laws|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/human-rights-guide-australias-counter-terrorism-laws|website=Australian Human Rights Commission|accessdate=13 April 2015|date=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCOZ&gt;{{cite web|title=National security and anti-terrorism laws in Australia|url=http://www.thenewsmanual.net/Resources/medialaw_in_australia_06.html|website=The News Manual|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rix|first1=Mark|title=Australia's Anti-Terrorism Legislation - The national security state and the community legal sector.|journal=Research Online - University of Wollongong|date=2006|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=gsbpapers|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
''Habeas corpus'' rights are part of the British legal tradition inherited by Canada. The rights exist in the common law but have been enshrined in the [[Constitution Act 1982]], under [[Section Ten of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section Ten]] of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html |title=The Constitution Act, 1982; Part I, Section 10(c): Legal Rights |publisher=Canadian Department of Justice |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This states that "Everyone has the right on arrest or detention&amp;nbsp;... (c) to have the validity of the detention determined by way of ''habeas corpus'' and to be released if the detention is not lawful".

Suspension of the writ in Canadian history occurred famously during the [[October Crisis]], during which the [[War Measures Act]] was invoked by the [[Governor General of Canada]] on the [[Advice (constitutional)|constitutional advice]] of Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], who had received a request from the [[Quebec]] Cabinet. The Act was also used to justify German, Slavic, and [[Ukrainian Canadian internment]] during the [[First World War]], and the internment of German-Canadians, Italian-Canadians and [[Japanese Canadian internment|Japanese-Canadians]] during the [[Second World War]]. The writ was suspended for several years following the [[Battle of Fort Erie (1866)]] during the [[Fenian Rising]], though the suspension was only ever applied to suspects in the [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]] assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/033001/f2/033001-1402.7-e.pdf |title=The Fenians in Canada |author=David A. Wilson |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ is available where there is no other adequate remedy. However, a superior court always has the discretion to grant the writ even in the face of an alternative remedy (see ''May v Ferndale Institution'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII |litigants=May v Ferndale Institution |link= |year=2005 |court=scc |num=82 |parallelcite=[2005] 3 SCR 809 |date=2005-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] the writ is largely unavailable if a statutory right of appeal exists, whether or not this right has been exercised.

===France===
A fundamental human right in the "1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]]" drafted by [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] in cooperation with [[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/marquis-de-lafayette|title=Marquis de Lafayette|publisher=Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia|date=2014|accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the guarantees against arbitrary detention are enshrined in the French Constitution and regulated by the Penal Code. The safeguards are equivalent to those found under the Habeas-Corpus provisions found in Germany, the United States and several Commonwealth countries. The French system of accountability prescribes severe penalties for ministers, police officers and civil and judiciary authorities who either violate or fail to enforce the law.

"Article 7 of [1789] Declaration also provides that 'No individual may be accused, arrested, or detained except where the law so prescribes, and in accordance with the procedure it has laid down.' ... The Constitution further states that 'No one may be arbitrarily detained. The judicial authority, guardian of individual liberty, ensures the observance of this principle under the condition specified by law.' Its article 5 provides that everyone has the right to liberty and sets forth permissible circumstances under which people may be deprived of their liberty and procedural safeguards in case of detention. In particular, it states that 'anyone deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/france.php|title=Habeas Corpus Rights: France - Author - Nicole Atwill, Senior Foreign Law Specialist|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|date=2009|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France and the United States played a synergistic role in the international team, led by Eleanor Roosevelt, which crafted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. The French judge and Nobel Peace Laureate [[René Cassin]] produced the first draft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article42 |title="A World Made New, Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights" de Mary Ann GLENDON - Author Emmanuel Decaux |publisher=Le Centre de recherche sur les droits de l'homme et le droit humanitaire, CRDH, Université Panthéon-Assas |accessdate=2014-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714114736/http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article42 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/history.shtml |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: History of The Document |publisher=The United Nations |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued against arbitrary detentions. René Cassin and the French team subsequently championed the ''habeas corpus'' provisions enshrined in the [[European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/twentieth-century-european-history/rene-cassin-and-human-rights-great-war-universal-declaration?format=HB |title=René Cassin and Human Rights: From the Great War to the Universal Declaration - Authors - Jay Winter, Antoine Prost |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=June 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Germany has constitutional guarantees against improper detention and these have been implemented in statutory law in a manner that can be considered as equivalent to writs of habeas corpus.

Article 104, paragraph 1 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] provides that deprivations of liberty may be imposed only on the basis of a specific enabling statute that also must include procedural rules. Article 104, paragraph 2 requires that any arrested individual be brought before a judge by the end of the day following the day of the arrest. For those detained as criminal suspects, article 104, paragraph 3 specifically requires that the judge must grant a hearing to the suspect in order to rule on the detention.

Restrictions on the power of the authorities to arrest and detain individuals also emanate from article 2 paragraph 2 of the Basic Law which guarantees liberty and requires a statutory authorization for any deprivation of liberty. In addition, several other articles of the Basic Law have a bearing on the issue. The most important of these are article 19, which generally requires a statutory basis for any infringements of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Basic Law while also guaranteeing judicial review; article 20, paragraph 3, which guarantees the rule of law; and article 3 which guarantees equality.

In particular, a constitutional obligation to grant remedies for improper detention is required by article 19, paragraph 4 of the Basic Law, which provides as follows: "Should any person's right be violated by public authority, he may have recourse to the courts. If no other jurisdiction has been established, recourse shall be to the ordinary courts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/germany.php |title=Habeas Corpus Rights: Germany&amp;#124;Law Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date= March 2009|accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The Indian judiciary, in a catena of cases, has effectively resorted to the writ of ''habeas corpus'' to secure release of a person from illegal detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baxi |first1=Pratiksha (April 2009 - Reprint 2012) |title=Habeas Corpus Juridical Narratives of Sexual Governance |url=http://www.jnu.ac.in/cslg/workingPaper/09-Habeus%20%28Pratiksha%20Baxi%29.pdf |publisher=Centre for the Study of Law and Governance Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi |accessdate=23 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006125237/http://www.jnu.ac.in/cslg/workingPaper/09-Habeus%20%28Pratiksha%20Baxi%29.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in October 2009, the Karnataka High Court heard a ''habeas corpus'' petition filed by the parents of a girl who married a Muslim boy from Kannur district and was allegedly confined in a ''madrasa'' in Malapuram town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/love-jihad-court-unhappy-with-probe/article169724.ece|title='Love Jihad': court unhappy with probe|date=27 Oct 2009|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, in most other jurisdictions, the writ is directed at police authorities. The extension to non-state authorities has its grounds in two cases: the 1898 [[Queen's Bench]] case of ''[[Ex Parte]] [[Proctor#Disciplinary functions|Daisy Hopkins]]'', wherein the Proctor of Cambridge University did detain and arrest Hopkins without his jurisdiction, and Hopkins was released,&lt;ref&gt;''Exparte, Hopkins'' (Daisy) (1891) 56 JP 262; 61 LJQB 240&lt;/ref&gt; and that of ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'', in which an African slave whose master had moved to London was freed by action of the writ.

The Indian judiciary has dispensed with the traditional doctrine of ''[[locus standi]]'', so that if a detained person is not in a position to file a petition, it can be moved on his behalf by any other person. The scope of ''habeas'' relief has expanded in recent times by actions of the Indian judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/wha.htm |title=Writ Of Habeas Corpus For Securing Liberty - Author - ABS-CBN News |publisher=Legalserviceindia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the ''habeas'' writ was used in the [[Rajan case]], a student victim of torture in local police custody during the nationwide [[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]] in India. On 12 March 2014, [[Subrata Roy]]'s counsel approached the Chief Justice moving a ''habeas corpus'' petition. It was also filed by the Panthers Party to protest the imprisonment of [[Anna Hazare]], a social activist.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the writ of ''habeas corpus'' is available at common law and under the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1782 and 1816. A remedy equivalent to ''habeas corpus'' is also guaranteed by Article 40 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|1937 constitution]].

The article guarantees that "no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law" and outlines a specific procedure for the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] to enquire into the lawfulness of any person's detention. It does not mention the Latin term, ''habeas corpus'', but includes the English phrase "produce the body".

Article 40.4.2° provides that a prisoner, or anyone acting on his behalf, may make a complaint to the High Court (or to any High Court judge) of unlawful detention. The court must then investigate the matter "forthwith" and may order that the defendant bring the prisoner before the court and give reasons for his detention. The court must immediately release the detainee unless it is satisfied that he is being held lawfully. The remedy is available not only to prisoners of the state, but also to persons unlawfully detained by any private party. However the constitution provides that the procedure is not binding on the [[Irish Defence Forces|Defence Forces]] during a state of war or armed rebellion.

The full text of Article 40.4.2° is as follows: {{quote|Upon complaint being made by or on behalf of any person to the High Court or any judge thereof alleging that such person is being unlawfully detained, the High Court and any and every judge thereof to whom such complaint is made shall forthwith enquire into the said complaint and may order the person in whose custody such person is detained to ''produce the body'' of such person before the High Court on a named day and to certify in writing the grounds of his detention, and the High Court shall, upon the body of such person being produced before that Court and after giving the person in whose custody he is detained an opportunity of justifying the detention, order the release of such person from such detention unless satisfied that he is being detained in accordance with the law. [''Italics'' added]}}

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' continued as part of the Irish law when the state seceded from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1922. A remedy equivalent to ''habeas corpus'' was also guaranteed by Article 6 of the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]], enacted in 1922. That article used similar wording to Article 40.4 of the current constitution, which replaced it 1937.

The relationship between the Article 40 and the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1782 and 1816 is ambiguous, and Forde and Leonard write that "The extent if any to which Art 40.4 has replaced these Acts has yet to be determined". In ''The State (Ahern) v Cotter'' (1982) Walsh J opined that the ancient writ referred to in the Habeas Corpus Acts remains in existence in Irish law as a separate remedy from that provided for in Article 40.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Forde, David Leonard, ''Constitutional Law of Ireland'', 2013, pp. 371-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, the Article 40 procedure was restricted by the [[Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Second Amendment]]. Prior to the amendment, a prisoner had the constitutional right to apply to any [[High Court of the Republic of Ireland|High Court]] judge for an enquiry into her detention, and to as many High Court judges as she wished. If the prisoner successfully challenged her detention before the High Court she was entitled to immediate, unconditional release.

The Second Amendment provided that a prisoner has only the right to apply to a single judge, and, once a writ has been issued, the President of the High Court has authority to choose the judge or panel of three judges who will decide the case. If the High Court finds that the prisoner's detention is unlawful due to the unconstitutionality of a law the judge must refer the matter to the [[Irish Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], and until the Supreme's Court's decision is rendered the prisoner may be released only on bail.

The power of the state to detain persons prior to trial was extended by the [[Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Sixteenth Amendment]], in 1996. In 1965, the Supreme Court ruled in the ''O'Callaghan'' case that the constitution required that an individual charged with a crime could be refused bail only if she was likely to flee or to interfere with witnesses or evidence. Since the Sixteenth Amendment, it has been possible for a court to take into account whether a person has committed serious crimes while on bail in the past.

===Italy===
The right to freedom from arbitrary detention is guaranteed by Article 13 of the [[Constitution of Italy]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution|url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Personal liberty is inviolable. No one may be detained, inspected, or searched nor otherwise subjected to any restriction of personal liberty except by order of the Judiciary stating a reason and only in such cases and in such manner as provided by the law. In exceptional circumstances and under such conditions of necessity and urgency as shall conclusively be defined by the law, the police may take provisional measures that shall be referred within 48 hours to the Judiciary for validation and which, in default of such validation in the following 48 hours, shall be revoked and considered null and void. Any act of physical and moral violence against a person subjected to restriction of personal liberty shall be punished. The law shall establish the maximum duration of preventive detention.}}

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], the remedy of ''habeas corpus'' is guaranteed by the federal constitution, although not by name. Article 5(2) of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] provides that "Where complaint is made to a High Court or any judge thereof that a person is being unlawfully detained the court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the court and release him".

As there are several statutes, for example, the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act 1960]], that still permit detention without trial, the procedure is usually effective in such cases only if it can be shown that there was a procedural error in the way that the detention was ordered.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], ''habeas corpus'' may be invoked against the government or private individuals. In 2006, a child was allegedly kidnapped by his maternal grandfather after a custody dispute. The father began ''habeas corpus'' proceedings against the mother, the grandfather, the grandmother, the great grandmother, and another person alleged to have assisted in the kidnap of the child. The mother did not present the child to the court and so was imprisoned for [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10407667|title=New Zealand Herald newspaper|publisher=Nzherald.co.nz|date=2006-10-26|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was released when the grandfather came forward with the child in late January 2007.

===Pakistan===
Issuance of a writ is an exercise of an extraordinary jurisdiction of the superior courts in Pakistan. A writ of habeas corpus may be issued by any High Court of a province in Pakistan. Article 199 of the [[Constitution of Pakistan|1973 Constitution]] of the [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]], specifically provides for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, empowering the courts to exercise this prerogative. Subject to the Article 199 of the Constitution, "A High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of any person, make an order that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without a lawful authority or in an unlawful manner". The hallmark of extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction is to keep various functionaries of State within the ambit of their authority. Once a High Court has assumed jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter before it, justiciability of the issue raised before it is beyond question. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has stated clearly that the use of words "in an unlawful manner" implies that the court may examine, if a statute has allowed such detention, whether it was a colorable exercise of the power of authority. Thus, the court can examine the malafides of the action taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/pakistan.php|title=Habeas Corpus Rights: Pakistan|work=loc.gov|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Philippines===
In the Bill of Rights of the Philippine constitution, ''habeas corpus'' is guaranteed in terms almost identically to those used in the U.S. Constitution. in Article 3, Section 15 of the [[Constitution of the Philippines]] states that "The privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' shall not be suspended except in cases of invasion or rebellion when the public safety requires it".

In 1971, after the [[Plaza Miranda bombing]], the Marcos administration, under [[Ferdinand Marcos]], suspended ''habeas corpus'' in an effort to stifle the oncoming insurgency, having blamed the [[Communist Party of the Philippines|Filipino Communist Party]] for the events of August 21. Many considered this to be a prelude to [[martial law]]. After widespread protests, however, the Arroyo administration decided to reintroduce the writ. In December 2009, ''habeas corpus'' was suspended in Maguindanao as the province was placed under martial law. This occurred in response to the [[Maguindanao massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=andoybarrios on Sat, 12/05/2009 - 23:08|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/12/04/09/arroyo-orders-martial-law-maguindanao|title=Arroyo proclaims martial law in Maguindanao - ABS-CBN News Online|publisher=Abs-cbnnews.com|date=2009-12-05|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] said he was planning on suspending the habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/152167-duterte-suspend-writ-habeas-corpus-warning|title=Duterte to suspend writ of habeas corpus if 'forced'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2017 at 10&amp;nbsp;pm Philippine time, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] declared martial law in the whole island of Mindanao including Sulu and Tawi-tawi for the period of 60 days due to the series of attacks mounted by the [[Maute group]], an ISIS-linked terrorist organization. The declaration suspends the writ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/05/23/1703088/duterte-declares-martial-law-mindanao|title=Duterte declares martial law in Mindanao|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
The [[Parliament of Scotland]] passed a law to have the same effect as ''habeas corpus'' in the 18th century. This is now known as the Criminal Procedure Act 1701 c.6.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1519689 Full text of the Act]. This law was given its current short title by the [[Statute Law Revision (Scotland) Act 1964]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally called "the Act for preventing wrongful imprisonment and against undue delays in trials". It is still in force although certain parts have been repealed.

===Spain===
The present [[Constitution of Spain]] states that "A ''habeas corpus'' procedure shall be provided for by law to ensure the immediate handing over to the judicial authorities of any person illegally arrested". The statute which regulates the procedure is the ''Law of Habeas Corpus of 24 May 1984'', which provides that a person imprisoned may, on her or his own or through a third person, allege that she or he is imprisoned unlawfully and request to appear before a judge. The request must specify the grounds on which the detention is considered to be unlawful, which can be, for example, that the custodian holding the prisoner does not have the legal authority, that the prisoner's constitutional rights have been violated, or that he has been subjected to mistreatment. The judge may then request additional information if needed, and may issue a ''habeas corpus'' order, at which point the custodian has 24 hours to bring the prisoner before the judge.

Historically, many of the territories of Spain had remedies equivalent to the ''habeas corpus'', such as the privilege of ''manifestación'' in the [[Crown or Aragon]] or the right of the Tree in [[Biscay]].

===United States===
{{Main|Habeas corpus in the United States}}
&lt;!-- This section is only a BRIEF SUMMARY. Please consider adding extra material to the main article instead! --&gt;
The United States inherited ''habeas corpus'' from the [[English common law]]. In England, the writ was issued in the name of the monarch. When the original [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen American colonies]] declared independence, and became a republic based on popular sovereignty, any person, in the name of the people, acquired authority to initiate such writs. The [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] specifically includes the ''habeas'' procedure in the [[Suspension Clause]] (Clause 2), located in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]], Section 9. This states that "The privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it".

The writ of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' is a civil, not criminal, ''[[ex parte]]'' proceeding in which a court inquires as to the legitimacy of a prisoner's custody. Typically, ''habeas corpus'' proceedings are to determine whether the court that imposed sentence on the defendant had jurisdiction and authority to do so, or whether the defendant's sentence has expired. ''Habeas corpus'' is also used as a legal avenue to challenge other types of custody such as pretrial detention or detention by the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|United States Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] pursuant to a deportation proceeding.

Presidents [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Ulysses Grant]] suspended ''habeas corpus'' during the Civil War and Reconstruction for some places or types of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/historicdocuments/a/lincolnhabeas.htm |title=Abraham Lincoln's 1862 Proclamation Suspending Habeas Corpus |publisher=Usgovinfo.about.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=70261 |title=Ulysses S. Grant: Proclamation 204 – Suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus in the County of Union, South Carolina |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] suspended habeas corpus. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], President [[George W. Bush]] attempted to place [[Guantanamo Bay]] detainees outside of the jurisdiction of ''habeas corpus'', but the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] overturned this action in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]''.

==Equivalent remedies==
===Biscay===
In 1526, the ''Fuero Nuevo of the Señorío de Vizcaya'' (''New Charter of the Lordship of Biscay'') established a form of ''habeas corpus'' in the territory of the ''[[Lord of Biscay|Señorío de Vizcaya]]'', nowadays part of [[Spain]]. This revised version of the ''Fuero Viejo'' (Old Charter) of 1451 codified the medieval custom whereby no person could be arbitrarily detained without being summoned first to the [[Gernikako Arbola|Oak of Gernika]], an ancestral oak tree located in the outskirts of [[Gernika]] under which all laws of the Lordship of Biscay were passed.

The New Charter formalised that no one could be detained without a court order (Law 26 of Chapter 9) nor due to debts (Law 3 of Chapter 16). It also established that no one could be arrested without previously having been summoned to the [[Gernikako Arbola|Oak of Gernika]] and given 30 days to answer the said summon, and that upon presenting themselves under the Tree, they had to be provided with all evidence and accusations so that they could defend themselves (Law 7 of Chapter 9). No one could be sent to prison or deprived of their freedom until being formally trialed, and no one could be accused of a different crime until their current court trial was over (Law 5 of Chapter 5). Those fearing they were being arrested illegally could appeal to the ''Regimiento General'' that their rights could be upheld. The ''Regimiento'' (the executive arm of the [[Juntas Generales]] of Biscay) would demand the prisoner be handed over to them, and thereafter the prisoner would be released and placed under the protection of the Regimiento while awaiting for trial.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, L. The History of Basque Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crown of Aragon===
The [[Crown of Aragon]] also had a remedy equivalent to the ''habeas corpus'' called the ''manifestación de personas'' (literally, ''demonstration of persons'').&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Giesey, If not, not: The Oath of the Aragonese and the Legendary Laws of Sobrarbe. Princeton University Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; According to the right of ''manifestación'', the [[Justicia de Aragon]] (lit. ''Justice of Aragon'', an Aragonese judiciary figure similar to an [[ombudsman]], but with far reaching executive powers) could require a judge, a court of justice, or any other official that they handed over to the ''Justicia'' (i.e., that they ''demonstrated'') anyone being prosecuted so as to guarantee that this person's rights were upheld, and that no violence would befall this person prior to him being sentenced.&lt;ref name="Tomás y Valiente 2000"&gt;Tomás y Valiente, Francisco (2000). La tortura judicial en España (2ª edición). Barcelona: Crítica. {{ISBN|84-8432-029-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the ''Justicia'' retained the right to examine the judgement and decide whether it satisfied the conditions of a fair trial; if the ''Justicia'' was not satisfied, he could refuse to hand the accused back to the authorities. The right of ''manifestación'' acted like an habeas corpus: knowing that the appeal to the ''Justicia'' would immediately follow any unlawful detention, these were effectively illegal. Equally, [[torture]] (which had been banned since 1325 in Aragon) could never take place.&lt;ref name="Tomás y Valiente 2000"/&gt; In some cases, people exerting their right of manifestación were kept under the Justicia's watch in ''manifestación'' prisons (famous for their mild and easy conditions) or house arrest; more generally however, the person was released from confinement and placed under the ''Justicia's protection'', awaiting trial. The ''Justicia'' always granted the right of ''manifestación'' by default, but they only really had to act in extreme cases, as for instance famously happened in 1590 when [[Antonio Pérez (statesman)|Antonio Pérez]], the disgraced secretary to [[Philip II of Spain]], fled from [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] to Aragon and used his Aragonese ascendency to appeal to the ''Justicia'' for manifestación right, and therefore prevent his arrest at the King's behest.

The right of ''manifestación'' was codified in 1325 in the [[Declaratio Privilegii generalis]] passed by the [[Aragonese Corts]] under king [[James II of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;González Antón, Luis, ''Las Uniones aragonesas y las Cortes del Reino (1283-1301)'', Zaragoza, Escuela de Estudios Medievales; CSIC; Librería General, 1975. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04150-2}} [http://books.google.es/books?id=sIYVCrzY8-4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage Vol I.

Documentos]. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04177-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been practiced since the inception of the kingdom of Aragon in the 11th century, and therefore predates the ''habeas corpus'' itself.&lt;ref name="Tomás y Valiente 2000"/&gt;

===Poland===
In 1430, King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] of Poland granted the Privilege of [[Jedlnia]], which proclaimed, ''[[Neminem captivabimus]] nisi iure victum'' ("We will not imprison anyone except if convicted by law"). This revolutionary innovation in civil [[libertarianism]] gave Polish citizens due process-style rights that did not exist in any other European country for another 250 years. Originally, the Privilege of Jedlnia was restricted to the nobility (the [[szlachta]]), but it was extended to cover townsmen in the [[Constitution of 3rd May|1791 Constitution]]. Importantly, social classifications in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were not as rigid as in other European countries; townspeople and Jews were sometimes ennobled. The Privilege of Jedlnia provided broader coverage than many subsequently enacted habeas corpus laws because Poland's nobility constituted an unusually large percentage of the country's total population, which was Europe's largest. As a result, by the 16th century, it was protecting the liberty of between five hundred thousand and a million Poles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indylaw.indiana.edu/instructors/cole/web%20page/polconst.pdf Poland's 1997 Constitution in Its Historical Context]; Daniel H. Cole, Indiana University School of Law, September 22, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman-Dutch law===
In [[South Africa]] and other countries whose legal systems are based on [[Roman-Dutch law]], the ''[[interdictum de homine libero exhibendo]]'' is the equivalent of the writ of ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Murdoch |last=Watney |title=Arrest, detention and the ''interdictum de homine libero exhibendo'' |journal=Journal of South African Law |volume=2011 |year=2011 |number=3 |pages=555–562 |url=http://reference.sabinet.co.za/webx/access/electronic_journals/ju_tsar/ju_tsar_2011_n3_a10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, it has been entrenched in the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]], which provides in section 35(2)(d) that every detained person has the right to challenge the lawfulness of the detention in person before a court and, if the detention is unlawful, to be released.

==World ''habeas corpus''==
In the 1950s, American lawyer [[Luis Kutner]] began advocating an international writ of ''habeas corpus'' to protect individual human rights. In 1952, he filed a petition for a "United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus" on behalf of [[William N. Oatis]], an American journalist jailed the previous year by the Communist government of [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;The petition was titled "United Nations Ex Rel., Luis Kutner, For and on Behalf of William N. Oatis, Petitioner, v. Czechoslovakia, Respondent - Petition of Luis Kutner For and on Behalf of William N. Oatis, For a United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus." See [http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/03/Jacksonfinal.pdf Vicki C. Jackson, "World Habeas Corpus", 91 Cornell Law Review 303, 309 (January 2006).] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Alleging that Czechoslovakia had violated Oatis's rights under the [[United Nations Charter]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and that the [[United Nations General Assembly]] had "inherent power" to fashion remedies for human rights violations, the petition was filed with the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/03/Jacksonfinal.pdf|format=PDF|first=Vicki C. |last=Jackson|title=World Habeas Corpus |volume=91 Cornell Law Review 303, 309-314 |year=January 2006|website=cornelllawreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission forwarded the petition to Czechoslovakia, but no other United Nations action was taken.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; Oatis was released in 1953. Kutner went on to publish numerous articles and books advocating the creation of an "International Court of Habeas Corpus".&lt;ref&gt;His first article was "A Proposal for a United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus and International Court of Human Rights", Tulane Law Review, 28 (June 1954): 417-441. See also, Luis Kutner, ''World Habeas Corpus'', Dobbs Ferry, NY: Oceana, 1962, p. 266, for his draft of a "Treaty-Statute of the International Court of Habeas Corpus".&lt;/ref&gt;

==International human rights standards==
Article 3 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] provides that "everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person". [[Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] goes further and calls for persons detained to have the right to challenge their detention, providing at article 5.4: {{quote|Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.}}

[[File:Paradise Lost 12.jpg|thumb|Illustration for John Milton's ''Paradise Lost'' by [[Gustave Doré]] (1866).The spiritual descent of [[Lucifer]] into [[Satan]] is one of the most famous examples of hubris.]]
'''Hubris''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|juː|b|r|ɪ|s}} from [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὕβρις|ὕβρις]]}}) describes a personality quality of extreme or foolish [[pride]] or dangerous [[confidence|overconfidence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hubris|title=Definition of HUBRIS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; often in combination with (or synonymous with) '''arrogance'''.&lt;ref name="Picone"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Picone, P. M., Dagnino, G. B., &amp; Minà, A.|title=. The origin of failure: A multidisciplinary appraisal of the hubris hypothesis and proposed research agenda|journal=The Academy of Management Perspectives|date=2014|volume=28 |issue=4|pages=447–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its [[ancient Greek]] context, it typically describes behavior that defies the norms of behavior or challenges the [[Deity|gods]], and which in turn brings about the downfall, or [[nemesis (mythology)|nemesis]], of the perpetrator of hubris.

The adjectival form of the noun ''hubris'' is "hubristic". Hubris is usually perceived as a characteristic of an individual rather than a group, although the group the offender belongs to may suffer collateral consequences from the wrongful act. Hubris often indicates a loss of contact with reality and an overestimation of one's own competence, accomplishments or capabilities. 

== Ancient Greek origin ==

===Common use===

In [[ancient Greek]], ''hubris'' referred to actions that shamed and humiliated the victim for the pleasure or gratification of the abuser.&lt;ref&gt;David Cohen, "Law, society and homosexuality or hermaphrodity in Classical Athens" in ''Studies in ancient Greek and Roman society'' By Robin Osborne; p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The term had a strong sexual connotation, and the shame reflected upon the perpetrator as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Nomos: Essays in Athenian Law, Politics and Society |last= Cartledge|first= |authorlink= Paul Cartledge |author2=Paul Millett |year= 2003 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-521-52209-0|page= 123 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3nCSw5Cr4PUC&amp;pg=PA123 |accessdate= 2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violations of the law against hubris included what might today be termed [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]]; sexual crimes; or the theft of public or sacred property. Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of [[Demosthenes]], a prominent statesman and orator in ancient [[Greece]]. These two examples occurred when first [[Midias]] punched Demosthenes in the face in the theatre (''[[Against Midias]]''), and second when (in ''Against Conon'') a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim. Yet another example of hubris appears in [[Aeschines]]' ''[[Against Timarchus]]'', where the defendant, Timarchus, is accused of breaking the law of hubris by submitting himself to [[prostitution]] and anal intercourse. Aeschines brought this suit against Timarchus to bar him from the rights of political office and his case succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;Aeschines "Against Timarchus" from Thomas K. Hubbard's ''Homosexuality in Greece and Rome: A Sourcebook of Basic Documents''&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Athens, hubris was defined as the use of violence to shame the victim (this sense of hubris could also characterize rape&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubris|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/hubris|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Aristotle]] defined hubris as shaming the victim, not because of anything that happened to the committer or might happen to the committer, but merely for that committer's own gratification:
&lt;blockquote&gt;to cause shame to the victim, not in order that anything may happen to you, nor because anything has happened to you, but merely for your own gratification. Hubris is not the requital of past injuries; this is revenge. As for the pleasure in hubris, its cause is this: naive men think that by ill-treating others they make their own superiority the greater.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0060%3Abekker+page%3D1378b ''Rhetoric'' 1378b].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=No mention of Hubris on page cited nor found in 'Rhetoric' on the Tufts site|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name=law&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=David|title=Law, Violence, and Community in Classical Athens|page=145|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJ9GjorvJGkC&amp;pg=PA145|isbn=0521388376|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eros&gt;{{cite book|last=Ludwig|first=Paul W.|title=Eros and Polis: Desire and Community in Greek Political Theory|page=178|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvqTEy-til8C&amp;pg=PA172|isbn=1139434179|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of [[honour]] (τιμή, ''timē'') and shame (αἰδώς, ''[[aidos|aidōs]]''). The concept of honour included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honour, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honour is akin to a [[zero-sum]] game. [[Rush Rehm]] simplifies this definition of hubris to the contemporary concept of "insolence, contempt, and excessive violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rehm |first1=Rush |title=Radical Theatre: Greek Tragedy in the Modern World |date=2014 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |location=Google Books |isbn=9781472502339 |page=75 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=8eanAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Rush+Rehm+hubris&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nz5iuQGTqX&amp;sig=0nlp6Yu745vHrOc_DTDlv-KVVGA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjUiL_1zubdAhUr94MKHUWUDgUQ6AEwCXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Rush%20Rehm%20hubris&amp;f=false |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious use===

The Greek word for sin, [[hamartia]] (ἁμαρτία), originally meant "error" in the ancient dialect, and so poets like [[Hesiod]] and [[Aeschylus]] used the word "hubris" to describe transgressions against the gods. &lt;ref&gt;The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/topic/hubris "Hubris"], ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; A common way that hubris was committed was when a mortal claimed to be better than a god in a particular skill or attribute. Claims like these were rarely left unpunished, and so [[Arachne]], a talented young weaver, was transformed into a spider when she said that her skills exceeded those of the goddess [[Athena]]. Additional examples include [[Icarus]], [[Phaethon]], [[Salmoneus]], [[Niobe]], [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]], and [[Tereus]].

These events were not limited to myth, and certain figures in history were considered to be have been punished for committing hubris through their arrogance. One such person was king [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] as portrayed in Aeschylus's play [[The_Persians|The Persians]], and who allegedly threw chains to [[Xerxes%27_Pontoon_Bridges|bind the Hellespont]] sea as punishment for daring to destroy his fleet.

What is common to all these examples is the breaching of limits, as the Greeks believed that the [[Moirai|Fates]] (Μοῖραι) had assigned each being with a particular area of freedom, an area that even the gods could not breach. &lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Castoriadis. Ce qui fait la Grèce, tome 1: D'Homère à Héraclite, chapitre V. Editeur: Seuil (9 mars 2004). &lt;/ref&gt;

===Representation===

The goddess [[Hybris (mythology)|Hybris]] has been described as having "insolent encroachment upon the rights of others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Themis |volume=26 |page=758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The New Testament ==

The word hubris as used in the New Testament parallels the Hebrew word ''pasha'', meaning transgression. It represents a sense of false pride that makes a man defy God, sometimes to the degree that he considers himself an equal. In contrast to this, the common word for sin was [[hamartia]], which refers to an error and reflects the complexity of the human condition. Its result is guilt rather than direct punishment as in the case of hubris &lt;ref&gt;Stanley J. Grenz. Theology for the Community of God, [https://books.google.es/books?id=NAPrXVh_56wC&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=hubris&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q=hubris&amp;f=false], Pub: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Modern usage ==
In its modern usage, hubris denotes overconfident pride combined with arrogance.&lt;ref name="Picone"/&gt; Hubris is often associated with a lack of [[humility]]. Sometimes a person's hubris is also associated with ignorance. The accusation of hubris often implies that suffering or punishment will follow, similar to the occasional pairing of hubris and [[Nemesis (mythology)|nemesis]] in Greek mythology. The proverb "pride goeth (goes) before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall" (from the biblical [[Book of Proverbs]], 16:18) is thought to sum up the modern use of hubris. Hubris is also referred to as "pride that blinds" because it often causes a committer of hubris to act in foolish ways that belie common sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 1920 Farrow's Bank Failure: A Case of Managerial Hubris|url=https://www.academia.edu/6081830/The_1920_Farrows_Bank_Failure_A_Case_of_Managerial_Hubris|publisher=Durham University |deadurl=no |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the modern definition may be thought of as, "that pride that goes just before the fall."

Examples of hubris are often found in literature, most famously in [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', in which [[Lucifer]] attempts to compel the other angels to worship him, is cast into hell by God and the innocent angels, and proclaims: "Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven." Victor in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' manifests hubris in his attempt to become a great scientist; he creates life through technological means, but comes to regret his project. [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]]'s play ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' portrays the eponymous character as a scholar whose arrogance and pride compel him to sign a [[deal with the Devil]], and retain his haughtiness until his death and damnation, despite the fact that he could easily have repented had he chosen to do so.

An example in pop culture is the comic book hero [[Doctor Strange]], wherein highly talented and arrogant [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] Dr. Stephen Strange is involved in a vehicular accident. Unlike the Greek figures Salmoneus, Icarus and Phaethon, he survives, though his hands are severely damaged, and thus his career as a neurosurgeon is shattered. After western medicine fails to help him, he seeks healing in the mystic arts, and though he never fully recovers, he becomes a powerful sorcerer.

A historical example of hubris was furnished by [[General George Armstrong Custer]] in the decisions that culminated in the [[Battle of Little Big Horn]]; Custer is apocryphally quoted as having exclaimed: "Where did all those damned Indians come from?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lev7YeUk7H0C&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=Where+did+all+those+damned+indians+come+from&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=52FAdoZNxG&amp;sig=Zm4zGjSr68YddlyMEx3KqWHbrac&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAmoVChMI9MeE0__iyAIVAX0mCh2S1ATy#v=onepage&amp;q=Where%20did%20all%20those%20damned%20indians%20come%20from&amp;f=false |title=The Words of Others: From Quotations to Culture |first1=Gary Saul |last1=Morson |page=176 |isbn=9780300167474 |location=New Haven.

[[C. S. Lewis]] wrote in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' that pride is the "anti-God" state, the position in which the [[wikt:ego#English|ego]] and the self are directly opposed to [[God]]: "Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mere Christianity : a revised and amplified edition, with a new introduction, of the three books, Broadcast talks, Christian behaviour, and Beyond personality |location=San Francisco |publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper]] |year=2001 |first1=C.S. |last1=Lewis |authorlink1=C.S.

The '''International Association of Art Critics''' (''Association Internationale des Critiques d’Art'', ''AICA'') was founded in 1950 to revitalize critical discourse, which suffered under [[Fascism]] during [[World War II]]. Affiliated with [[UNESCO]] AICA was admitted to the rank of [[non-governmental organization]] in 1951.

The main [[goal|objectives]] of AICA are:
* to promote the critical disciplines in the field of [[visual art]]s

{{Cosmology|comp/struct}}
The '''ΛCDM''' ('''Lambda cold dark matter''') or '''Lambda-CDM''' model is a [[parametrization]] of the [[Big Bang]] [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] model in which the universe contains a [[cosmological constant]], denoted by [[Lambda]] ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]] '''Λ'''), associated with [[dark energy]], and [[cold dark matter]] (abbreviated '''CDM'''). It is frequently referred to as the '''standard model''' of Big Bang cosmology because it is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of the following properties of the cosmos:
* the existence and structure of the [[cosmic microwave background]]
* the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure]] in the distribution of galaxies
* the [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundances]] of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|hydrogen (including deuterium), helium, and lithium]]
* the accelerating [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]] observed in the light from distant galaxies and [[supernova]]e

The model assumes that [[general relativity]] is the correct theory of gravity on cosmological scales.
It emerged in the late 1990s as a '''concordance cosmology''', after a period of time when disparate observed properties of the universe appeared mutually inconsistent, and there was no consensus on the makeup of the energy density of the universe.

The ΛCDM model can be extended by adding [[cosmological inflation]], [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] and other elements that are current areas of speculation and research in cosmology.

Some alternative models challenge the assumptions of the ΛCDM model. Examples of these are [[modified Newtonian dynamics]], modified gravity, theories of large-scale variations in the matter density of the universe, and scale invariance of empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeder|first=Andre|date=2017|title=An Alternative to the ΛCDM Model: The Case of Scale Invariance|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0004-637X/834/i=2/a=194|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=834|issue=2|pages=194|doi=10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/194|issn=0004-637X|arxiv=1701.03964|bibcode=2017ApJ...834..194M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pavel Kroupa|P.

==Overview==
[[File:Lambda-Cold Dark Matter, Accelerated Expansion of the Universe, Big Bang-Inflation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|Lambda-CDM, accelerated expansion of the universe. The time-line in this schematic diagram extends from the Big Bang/inflation era 13.7 Byr ago to the present cosmological time.]]
Most modern cosmological models are based on the [[cosmological principle]], which states that our observational location in the universe is not unusual or special; on a large-enough scale, the universe looks the same in all directions ([[isotropy]]) and from every location ([[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]]).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Liddle. ''An Introduction to Modern Cosmology (2nd ed.).'' London: Wiley, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model includes an expansion of metric space that is well documented both as the [[red shift]] of prominent spectral absorption or emission lines in the light from distant galaxies and as the time dilation in the light decay of supernova luminosity curves. Both effects are attributed to a [[Doppler shift]] in electromagnetic radiation as it travels across expanding space. Although this expansion increases the distance between objects that are not under shared gravitational influence, it does not increase the size of the objects (e.g. galaxies) in space. It also allows for distant galaxies to recede from each other at speeds greater than the speed of light; local expansion is less than the speed of light, but expansion summed across great distances can collectively exceed the speed of light.

The letter &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; (lambda) represents the [[cosmological constant]], which is currently associated with a vacuum energy or [[dark energy]] in empty space that is used to explain the contemporary accelerating expansion of space against the attractive effects of gravity. A cosmological constant has negative pressure, &lt;math&gt; p = - \rho c^{2} &lt;/math&gt;, which contributes to the [[stress-energy tensor]] that, according to the general theory of relativity, causes accelerating expansion. The fraction of the total energy density of our (flat or almost flat) universe that is dark energy, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{\Lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, is currently (2015) estimated to be 0.692 ± 0.012, or even 0.6911 ± 0.0062 based on [[Planck satellite]] data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/planck-upholds-standard-cosmology-0210201523/ Camille M. Carlisle, ''Planck Upholds Standard Cosmology'', Sky &amp; Telescope, February 10, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dark matter]] is postulated in order to account for gravitational effects observed in very large-scale structures (the "flat" [[rotation curve]]s of galaxies; the [[gravitational lens]]ing of light by galaxy clusters; and enhanced clustering of galaxies) that cannot be accounted for by the quantity of observed matter. [[Cold dark matter]] is ''non-[[baryon]]ic'', i.e. it consists of matter other than protons and neutrons (and electrons, by convention, although electrons are not baryons); ''cold'', i.e. its velocity is far less than the speed of light at the epoch of radiation-matter equality (thus neutrinos are excluded, being non-baryonic but not cold); ''dissipationless'', i.e. it cannot cool by radiating photons; and ''collisionless'', i.e. the dark matter particles interact with each other and other particles only through gravity and possibly the weak force. The dark matter component is currently (2013) estimated to constitute about 26.8% of the mass-energy density of the universe.

The remaining 4.9% (2013) comprises all ordinary matter observed as atoms, chemical elements, gas and plasma, the stuff of which visible planets, stars and galaxies are made. The great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10% of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Also, the energy density includes a very small fraction (~ 0.01%) in cosmic microwave background radiation, and not more than 0.5% in [[relic neutrinos]]. Although very small today, these were much more important in the distant past, dominating the matter at redshift &gt; 3200.

The model includes a single originating event, the "Big Bang", which was not an explosion but the abrupt appearance of expanding [[space-time]] containing radiation at temperatures of around 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; K. This was immediately (within 10&lt;sup&gt;−29&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) followed by an exponential expansion of space by a scale multiplier of 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; or more, known as [[cosmic inflation]]. The early universe remained hot (above 10,000 K) for several hundred thousand years, a state that is detectable as a residual [[cosmic microwave background]], or CMB, a very low energy radiation emanating from all parts of the sky. The "Big Bang" scenario, with cosmic inflation and standard particle physics, is the only current cosmological model consistent with the observed continuing expansion of space, the observed distribution of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|lighter elements in the universe]] (hydrogen, helium, and lithium), and the spatial texture of minute irregularities ([[Anisotropy|anisotropies]]) in the CMB radiation. Cosmic inflation also addresses the "[[horizon problem]]" in the CMB; indeed, it seems likely that the universe is larger than the observable [[particle horizon]].

The model uses the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], the [[Friedmann equations]] and the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|cosmological equations of state]] to describe the observable universe from right after the [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Inflationary epoch|inflationary epoch]] to present and future.

== Cosmic expansion history ==
The expansion of the universe is parametrized by a [[dimensionless]] [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt;a = a(t)&lt;/math&gt; (with time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; counted from the birth of the universe), defined relative to the present day, so &lt;math&gt;a_0 = a(t_0) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;; the usual convention in cosmology is that subscript 0 denotes present-day values, so &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the current age of the universe. The scale factor is related to the observed [[Redshift#Expansion of space|redshift]]&lt;ref name="Dodelson"/&gt; &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; of the light emitted at time &lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{em}&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over a(t_\mathrm{em})} = 1 + z.&lt;/math&gt;
The expansion rate is described by the time-dependent [[Hubble parameter]], &lt;math&gt;H(t)&lt;/math&gt;, defined as
:&lt;math&gt;H(t) \equiv \frac{\dot a}{a},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\dot a&lt;/math&gt; is the time-derivative of the scale factor.  The first [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]] gives the expansion rate in terms of the matter+radiation density {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;,}} the [[Curvature of the universe|curvature]] {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;,}} and the [[cosmological constant]] {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;,}}&lt;ref name="Dodelson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodelson|first1=Scott|title=Modern cosmology|date=2008|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=San Diego, CA [etc.]|isbn=978-0122191411|edition=4. [print.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H^2 = \left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{kc^2}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}, &lt;/math&gt;

where as usual {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;}} is the speed of light and {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;}} is the [[gravitational constant]]. 
A critical density &lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{crit}&lt;/math&gt; is the present-day density, which gives zero curvature &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, assuming the cosmological constant &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is zero, regardless of its actual value. Substituting these conditions to the Friedmann equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{crit} = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \pi G} = 1.878\;47(23) \times 10^{-26} \; h^2 \; \text{kg} \; \text{m}^{-3},&lt;/math&gt;{{refn|name=constants|{{cite web|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2015/reviews/rpp2014-rev-astrophysical-constants.pdf |title=The Review of Particle Physics. 2.

where &lt;math&gt; h \equiv H_0 / (100 \; \mathrm{km \; s^{-1} \; Mpc^{-1}}) &lt;/math&gt; is the reduced Hubble constant.
If the cosmological constant were actually zero, the critical density would also mark the dividing line between eventual recollapse of the universe to a [[Big Crunch]], or unlimited expansion. For the Lambda-CDM model with a positive cosmological constant (as observed), the universe is predicted to expand forever regardless of whether the total density is slightly above or below the critical density; though other outcomes are possible in extended models where the [[dark energy]] is not constant but actually time-dependent.

It is standard to define the present-day '''density parameter''' &lt;math&gt;\Omega_x&lt;/math&gt; for various species as the dimensionless ratio
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_x \equiv \frac{\rho_x(t=t_0)}{\rho_\mathrm{crit} } = \frac{8 \pi G\rho_x(t=t_0)}{3 H_0^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where the subscript &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is one of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; for [[Baryon|baryons]], &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for [[cold dark matter]], &lt;math&gt;rad&lt;/math&gt; for [[radiation]] ([[Photon|photons]] plus relativistic [[Neutrino|neutrinos]]), and &lt;math&gt;DE&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; for [[dark energy]].

Since the densities of various species scale as different powers of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. &lt;math&gt;a^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; for matter etc.,
the [[Friedmann equation]] can be conveniently rewritten in terms of the various density parameters as
:&lt;math&gt;H(a) \equiv \frac{\dot{a}}{a} = H_0 \sqrt{ (\Omega_c + \Omega_b) a^{-3} + \Omega_\text{rad} a^{-4} + \Omega_k a^{-2} + \Omega_{DE} a^{-3(1+w)} } &lt;/math&gt;
where w is the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of dark energy, and assuming negligible neutrino mass (significant neutrino mass requires a more complex equation). The various &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; parameters add up to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; by construction.
In the general case this is integrated by computer to give
the expansion history &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; and also observable distance-redshift relations for any chosen values of the cosmological parameters, which can then be compared with observations such as [[supernovae]] and [[baryon acoustic oscillations]].

In the minimal 6-parameter Lambda-CDM model, it is assumed that curvature &lt;math&gt;\Omega_k&lt;/math&gt; is zero and &lt;math&gt; w = -1 &lt;/math&gt;, so this simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt; H(a) = H_0 \sqrt{ \Omega_m a^{-3} + \Omega_\text{rad} a^{-4} + \Omega_\Lambda } &lt;/math&gt;

Observations show that the radiation density is very small today, &lt;math&gt; \Omega_\text{rad} \sim 10^{-4} &lt;/math&gt;; if this term is neglected
the above has an analytic solution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frieman|first1=Joshua A.|last2=Turner|first2=Michael S.|last3=Huterer|first3=Dragan|title=Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|year=2008|volume=46|issue=1|pages=385–432|arxiv=0803.0982|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243|bibcode=2008ARA&amp;A..46..385F}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a(t) = (\Omega_m / \Omega_\Lambda)^{1/3} \, \sinh^{2/3} ( t / t_\Lambda) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; t_\Lambda \equiv 2 / (3 H_0 \sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda} ) \ ; &lt;/math&gt;
this is fairly accurate for &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 0.01&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 10&lt;/math&gt;million years.
Solving for &lt;math&gt; a(t) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; gives the present age of the universe &lt;math&gt; t_0 &lt;/math&gt; in terms of the other parameters.

It follows that the transition from decelerating to accelerating expansion (the second derivative &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt; crossing zero) occurred when
:&lt;math&gt; a = ( \Omega_m / 2 \Omega_\Lambda )^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;

which evaluates to &lt;math&gt;a \sim 0.6&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z \sim 0.66&lt;/math&gt; for the best-fit parameters estimated from the [[Planck spacecraft]].

==Historical development==
The discovery of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] (CMB) in 1964 confirmed a key prediction of the [[Big Bang]] cosmology. From that point on, it was generally accepted that the universe started in a hot, dense state and has been expanding over time. The rate of expansion depends on the types of matter and energy present in the universe, and in particular, whether the total density is above or below the so-called critical density. During the 1970s, most attention focused on pure-baryonic models, but there were serious challenges explaining the formation of galaxies, given the small anisotropies in the CMB (upper limits at that time). In the early 1980s, it was realized that this could be resolved if cold dark matter dominated over the baryons, and the theory of [[cosmic inflation]] motivated models with critical density. During the 1980s, most research focused on cold dark matter with critical density in matter, around 95% CDM and 5% baryons: these showed success at forming galaxies and clusters of galaxies, but problems remained; notably, the model required a Hubble constant lower than preferred by observations, and observations around 1988-1990 showed more large-scale galaxy clustering than predicted. These difficulties sharpened with the discovery of CMB anisotropy by [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] in 1992, and several modified CDM models, including ΛCDM and mixed cold and hot dark matter, came under active consideration through the mid-1990s. The ΛCDM model then became the leading model following the observations of [[Accelerating universe|accelerating expansion]] in 1998, and was quickly supported by other observations: in 2000, the [[BOOMERanG]] microwave background experiment measured the total (matter–energy) density to be close to 100% of critical, whereas in 2001 the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dFGRS]] galaxy redshift survey measured the matter density to be near 25%; the large difference between these values supports a positive Λ or [[dark energy]]. Much more precise spacecraft measurements of the microwave background from [[WMAP]] in 2003 – 2010 and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] in 2013 - 2015 have continued to support the model and pin down the parameter values, most of which are now constrained below 1 percent uncertainty.

There is currently active research into many aspects of the ΛCDM model, both to refine the parameters and possibly detect deviations. In addition, ΛCDM has no explicit physical theory for the origin or physical nature of dark matter or dark energy; the nearly scale-invariant spectrum of the CMB perturbations, and their image across the celestial sphere, are believed to result from very small thermal and acoustic irregularities at the point of recombination. A large majority of astronomers and astrophysicists support the ΛCDM model or close relatives of it, but [[Mordehai Milgrom|Milgrom]], [[Stacy McGaugh|McGaugh]], and [[Pavel Kroupa|Kroupa]] are leading critics, attacking the dark matter portions of the theory from the perspective of [[galaxy formation]] models and supporting the alternative [[MOND]] theory, which requires a modification of the [[Einstein field equations]] and the [[Friedmann equations]] as seen in proposals such as [[MOG theory]] or [[Tensor–vector–scalar gravity|TeVeS theory]]. Other proposals by theoretical astrophysicists of cosmological alternatives to Einstein's general relativity that attempt to account for dark energy or dark matter include [[f(R) gravity]], [[Scalar–tensor theory|scalar–tensor theories]] such as [[galileon]] theories, [[brane cosmology|brane cosmologies]], the [[DGP model]], and [[massive gravity]] and its extensions such as [[bimetric theory|bimetric gravity]].

==Successes==
In addition to explaining pre-2000 observations,
the model has made a number of successful predictions: notably the existence of the
[[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature, discovered in 2005 in the predicted location; and the statistics of weak [[gravitational lensing]], first observed in 2000 by several teams.

The six free parameters can be well constrained by the TT spectrum alone, and then the TE and EE spectra can be predicted theoretically to few-percent precision with no further adjustments allowed: comparison of theory and observations shows an excellent match.

==Challenges==
Extensive searches for dark matter particles have so far shown no well-agreed detection;
the dark energy may be almost impossible to detect in a laboratory, and its value is [[cosmological constant problem|unnaturally small]] compared to [[vacuum energy|naive theoretical predictions]].

Comparison of the model with observations is very successful on large scales (larger than galaxies, up to the observable horizon), but may have some problems on sub-galaxy scales, possibly predicting [[Dwarf galaxy problem|too many dwarf galaxies]] and too much dark matter in the innermost regions of galaxies. This problem is called the "small scale crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

It has been argued that the ΛCDM model is built upon a foundation of [[conventionalism|conventionalist stratagems]], rendering it [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] in the sense defined by [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Merritt|Merritt, David]] [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219816301563 "Cosmology and Convention"], ''Studies In History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies In History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'', '''57'''(1):41-52, February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The simple ΛCDM model is based on six [[parameter]]s: physical baryon density parameter; physical dark matter density parameter; the age of the universe; scalar spectral index; curvature fluctuation amplitude; and reionization optical depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The dark side of the cosmology: dark matter and dark energy|author=Spergel, D. N.|journal=Science|volume=347|issue=6226|year=2015|doi=10.1126/science.aaa0980|pmid=25745164|pages=1100–1102|bibcode=2015Sci...347.1100S}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with [[Occam's razor]], six is the smallest number of parameters needed to give an acceptable fit to current observations; other possible parameters are fixed at "natural" values, e.g. total density parameter = 1.00, dark energy equation of state = −1. (See below for extended models that allow these to vary.)

The values of these six parameters are mostly not predicted by current theory (though, ideally, they may be related by a future "[[Theory of Everything]]"), except that most versions of [[cosmic inflation]] predict the scalar spectral index should be slightly smaller than 1, consistent with the estimated value 0.96. The parameter values, and uncertainties, are estimated using large computer searches to locate the region of parameter space providing an acceptable match to cosmological observations. From these six parameters, the other model values, such as the [[Hubble's law|Hubble constant]] and the [[dark energy]] density, can be readily calculated.

Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the [[cosmic microwave background]] anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the [[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, [[weak gravitational lensing]] and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less precisely measured at present.

Parameter values listed below are from the Planck Collaboration Cosmological parameters 68% confidence limits for the base ΛCDM model from Planck CMB power spectra, in combination with lensing reconstruction and external data (BAO + JLA + H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Planck Collaboration | title = Planck 2015 results.

==Missing baryon problem==
{{main article|Missing baryon problem}}
Massimo Persic and Paolo Salucci&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0502178.pdf The baryon content of the universe, M. Persic and P. Salucci, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; firstly estimated the baryonic density today present in ellipticals, spirals, groups and clusters of galaxies.
They performed an integration of the baryonic mass-to-light ratio over luminosity (in the following &lt;math display="inline"&gt;  M_b/L &lt;/math&gt;), weighted with the luminosity function &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi(L)&lt;/math&gt; over the previously mentioned classes of astrophysical objects: 

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_b = \sum \int L\phi(L) \frac{M_b}{L} \, dL.&lt;/math&gt;

The result was:

:&lt;math&gt; \Omega_b=\Omega_*+\Omega_\text{gas}=2.2\times10^{-3}+1.5\times10^{-3}h^{-1.3}\simeq0.003&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; h\simeq0.72 &lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this value is much lower than the prediction of standard cosmic nucleosynthesis &lt;math&gt; \Omega_b\simeq0.048 &lt;/math&gt;, so that stars and gas in galaxies and in galaxy groups and clusters account for less than 10% of the primordially synthesized baryons. This issue is known as the problem of the "missing baryons".

Extended models allow one or more of the "fixed" parameters above to vary, in addition to the basic six; so these models join smoothly to the basic six-parameter model in the limit that the additional parameter(s) approach the default values. For example, possible extensions of the simplest ΛCDM model allow for spatial curvature (&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; may be different from 1); or [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] rather than a [[cosmological constant]] where the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of dark energy is allowed to differ from −1. Cosmic inflation predicts tensor fluctuations ([[gravitational wave]]s). Their amplitude is parameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio (denoted &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;), which is determined by the unknown energy scale of inflation. Other modifications allow [[hot dark matter]] in the form of [[neutrino]]s more massive than the minimal value, or a running spectral index; the latter is generally not favoured by simple cosmic inflation models.

Allowing additional variable parameter(s) will generally ''increase'' the uncertainties in the standard six parameters quoted above, and may also shift the central values slightly. The Table below shows results for each of the possible "6+1" scenarios with one additional variable parameter; this indicates that, as of 2015, there is no convincing evidence that any additional parameter is different from its default value.

Some researchers have suggested that there is a running spectral index, but no statistically significant study has revealed one. Theoretical expectations suggest that the tensor-to-scalar ratio &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; should be between 0 and 0.3, and the latest results are now within those limits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12091">'''Language expectancy theory''' ('''LET''') is a theory of [[persuasion]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Burgoon and Miller, 1985; M. Burgoon, Hunsaker &amp; Dawson, 1994; M. Burgoon, Jones &amp; Stewart, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The theory assumes language is a rules-based system, in which people develop expected norms as to appropriate language usage in given situations.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;M. Burgoon and Miller. 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, unexpected linguistic usage can affect the receiver's behavior resulting from attitudes towards a persuasive message.

==Background==
Created by Michael Burgoon, a retired professor of medicine from the University of Arizona, and Gerald R. Miller, the inspiration for LET was sparked by Brooks' work on expectations of language in 1970. Burgoon, Jones and Stewart furthered the discussion with the idea of linguistic strategies and message intensity in an essay published in 1975. The essay linked linguistic strategies, or how a message is framed, to effective persuasive outcomes. The original work for the language expectation theory was published in 1978. Titled "An empirical test of a model of resistance to persuasion", it outlined the theory through 17s.

==Expectations==
The theory views language expectancies as enduring patterns of anticipated communication behavior which are grounded in a society's [[psychological]] and [[culture|cultural norms]]. Such [[social influence|societal forces]] influence language and enable the identification of non-normative use; violations of linguistic, syntactic and semantic expectations will either facilitate or inhibit an audience's receptivity to persuasion.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; Burgoon claims applications for his theory in management, media, politics and medicine, and declares that his empirical research has shown a greater effect than [[expectancy violations theory]], the domain of which does not extend to the spoken word.

LET argues that typical language behaviors fall within a normative "bandwidth" of [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]s determined by a source's perceived credibility, the individual listener's normative expectations and a group's [[normative social influence|normative social climate]], and generally supports a [[sexism|gender-stereotypical reaction]] to the use of [[profanity]], for example.&lt;ref name="M. Burgoon, Hunsaker &amp; Dawson, 1994"&gt;M. Burgoon, Hunsaker &amp; Dawson, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication expectancies are said to derive from three factors: 
#  The communicator – individual features, such as [[ethos]] or [[source credibility]], personality, appearance, social status and [[gender]].
#  The relationship between a receiver and a communicator, including factors such as attraction, similarity and status equality.
#  Context; i.e., privacy and formality constraints on interaction.

==Violations==
Violating social norms can have a positive or negative effect on persuasion. Usually people use language to conform to social norms; but a person's intentional or accidental deviation from expected behavior can have either a positive or negative reaction.Language Expectancy Theory assumes that language is a rule-governed system and people develop expectations concerning the language or message strategies employed by others in persuasive attempts (Burgoon, 1995). Expectations are a function of cultural and sociological norms and preferences arising from cultural values and societal standards or ideals for competent communication.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt;

When observed, behavior is preferred over what was expected or when a listener's initial negative evaluation causes a speaker to conform more closely to the expected behavior. The deviation can be seen as positive,&lt;ref&gt;M. Burgoon, 1994; M. Burgoon and Miller, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; but when language choice or behavior is perceived as unacceptable or inappropriate behavior, the violation is negatively received and can inhibit the receptivity to a persuasive appeal.&lt;ref name="M. Burgoon, Hunsaker &amp; Dawson, 1994"/&gt;

Positive violations occur (b) when negatively evaluated sources conform more closely than expected to cultural values or situational norms. This can result in overly positive evaluation of the source and change promoted by the actor (Burgoon, 1995).

Negative violations, resulting from language choices that lie outside socially acceptable behavior in a negative direction, produce no attitude or behavior change in receivers.

Language expectancy theory is based on 17 propositions.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; Those propositions can be summarized as listed below:
* 1, 2 and 3: People create expectations for language. Those expectations determine whether messages will be accepted or rejected by an individual. Breaking expectations positively results in a behavior change in favor of the persuasive message while a breaking expectations negatively results in no change or an opposite behavior change.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard &amp; Pfau, 2001, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;
* 4, 5 and 6: Individuals with perceived credibility (those who hold power in a society) have the freedom in persuasion to select varied language strategies (wide bandwidth). Those with low credibility and those unsure of their perceived credibility are restricted to low aggression or compliance-gaining messages to be persuasive.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard &amp; Pfau, 2001, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;
* 7, 8 and 9:  Irrelevant fear and anxiety tactics are better received using low-intensity and verbally unaggressive compliance-gaining. Intense and aggressive language use result in lower levels of persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard &amp; Pfau, 2001, p. 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;
* 10, 11 and 12: For the persuader, an individual who is experiencing cognitive stress will use lower intensity messages. If a communicator violates his/her norms of communication, they will experience cognitive stress.&lt;ref name="Dillard &amp; Pfau, 2001, p. 126"&gt;Dillard &amp; Pfau, 2001, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;
* 13 and 14: Pretreatments forewarn receivers of the persuasive attacks (supportive, refutational or a combination). When Persuasive messages do not violate expectations created by the pretreatments, resistance to persuasion is conferred. When pretreatment expectations of persuasive messages are violated, receivers are less resistant to persuasion.&lt;ref name="Dillard &amp; Pfau, 2001, p. 126"/&gt;   
* 15, 16 and 17: Low intensity attack strategies are more effective than high intensity attack strategies when overcoming resistance to persuasion created in pretreatment. The first message in a string of arguments methodically affects the acceptance of the second message. When expectations are positively violated in the first message, the second will be persuasive. When expectations are negatively violated in the first message, the second will not be persuasive.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard &amp; Pfau, 2001, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of intensity==
These propositions give rise to the impact of [[language intensity]]—defined by [http://comm.colorado.edu/bowersj John Waite Bowers]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} as a quality of language that "indicates the degree to which the speaker's attitude toward a concept deviates from neutrality"&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 1963, p. 345; 1964, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;—on persuasive messages.&lt;ref&gt;M. Burgoon and Miller, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists have concentrated on two key areas: (1) intensity of language when it comes to gender roles and (2) credibility.

The perceived credibility of a source can greatly affect a message's persuasiveness. Researchers found that credible sources can enhance their appeal by using intense language; however, less credible speakers are more persuasive with low-intensity appeals.&lt;ref name="bdd"&gt;M. Burgoon, Dillard &amp; Doran, 1983; M. Burgoon, Hunsaker &amp; Dawson, 1994; M. Burgoon and Miller, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, females are less persuasive than males when they use intense language because it violates the expected behavior,&lt;ref name="bdd"/&gt; but are more persuasive when they use low-intensity language. Males, however, are seen as weak when they argue in a less intense manner. Theorists argue further that females and speakers perceived as having low credibility have less freedom in selecting message strategies and that the use of aggressive language negatively violates expectations.&lt;ref&gt;M. Burgoon, Dillard &amp; Doran, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
To better explain the theory we look at the expectations and societal norms for a man and a woman on their first date. If the man pushed for further physical intimacy after dinner, the societal expectation of a first date would be violated. The example below with Margret and Steve depicts such a scene. 

Margret: ''"I had a really good time tonight, Steve. We should do it again."''

Steve: ''"Let's cut the crap. Do you want to have sex?"''

Margret: ''"Uhhh..."''

Margret's language expectations of a first date were violated. Steve chooses an aggressive linguistic strategy. If Margret views Steve as a credible and appealing source, she may receive the message positively and, thus, the message would be persuasive. If Margret perceives Steve as an ambiguous or low-credible source, Steve will not be persuasive. In such a case, Steve should have used a low-aggressive message in his attempt to win Margret to his idea of having sex.

==Criticism==
* Determining whether a positive or negative violation has occurred can be difficult.&lt;ref name="M. Burgoon, 1993"&gt;M. Burgoon, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; When there is no attitude or behavior change it may be concluded that a negative violation has occurred (possibly related to a boomerang effect). Conversely, when an attitude or behavior change does occur it may be too easy to conclude a positive violation of expectations has occurred.
* Scholars are beginning to see LET as out of date research. The theory itself may be plausible, but the assumption women, who use intense language, are low credible communicators is less prevalent in a society moving towards greater rights for minorities and the oppressed.
* The theory has also been critiqued for being too "grand" in its predictive and explanatory goals.&lt;ref name="M. Burgoon, 1993"/&gt; Burgoon counters that practical applications of his research conclusions are compelling enough to negate this criticism.

'''''Mathesis universalis''''' (Greek μάθησις, ''mathesis'' "science or learning",  Latin ''universalis'' "universal") is a hypothetical universal science modeled on [[mathematics]] envisaged by [[Descartes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], among a number of more minor 16th and 17th century philosophers and mathematicians. [[John Wallis]] invokes the name as the title to a textbook on [[Cartesian geometry]]. For Leibniz, it would be supported by a [[calculus ratiocinator]].

Descartes' clearest description of the ''mathesis universalis'' occurs in Rule IV of the [[Rules for the Direction of the Mind]], written before 1628. The desire for a language more perfect than any [[natural language]] had been expressed before Leibniz by [[John Wilkins]] in his ''[[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language]]'' in 1668. Leibniz attempts to work out the possible connections between algebra, infinitesimal calculus, and universal character in an incomplete treatise titled "''Mathesis Universalis''" in 1695.

[[Predicate logic]] could be seen as a modern system with some of these ''universal'' characteristics, at least as far as mathematics and [[computer science]] are concerned. More generally, ''mathesis universalis'', along with perhaps [[François Viète]]'s [[algebra]], represents one of the earliest attempts to construct a [[formal system]].

One of the perhaps most prominent critics of the idea of ''mathesis universalis'' was [[Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics|Ludwig Wittgenstein and his philosophy of mathematics.]] As Anthropologist Prof. Emily Martin notes: 'Tackling mathematics, the realm of symbolic life perhaps most difficult to regard as contingent on social norms, Wittgenstein commented that people found the idea that numbers rested on conventional social understandings "unbearable"'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Emily|date=October 2013|title=The Potentiality of Ethnography and the Limits of Affect Theory|url=|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=54| issue =  S7|pages=156|doi=10.1086/670388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discussions of Wittgenstein|last=Rhees|first=Rush|publisher=Schocken|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10600">{{planes of existence}}
The '''mental plane''', or '''world of thought''', in [[Hermeticism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]], [[Rosicrucian]], [[Sri Aurobindo|Aurobindonian]], and [[New Age]] thought refers to the macrocosmic or universal [[Plane (cosmology)|plane]] or [[reality]] that is made up purely of [[thought]] or mindstuff. In contrast to [[Western world|Western]] [[secularism|secular]] [[modernism|modernist]] and [[postmodernism|post-modern]] thought, in [[Occultism|occult]] and [[esoteric cosmology]], thoughts and [[consciousness]] are not just a byproduct of [[brain]] functioning, but have their own [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] reality quite independent of the [[physical plane|physical]]. This reality itself constitutes only one gradation in a whole series of planes of [[existence]] (the total number of planes varies, although seven is a common number in Theosophical formulations). In most such cosmologies and explanations of reality, the mental plane is located between, and hence is intermediate between, the [[astral plane]] below and the higher spiritual realms of existence above.

== Predecessors of the concept ==

In India in the seventh century b.c.e., the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]] referred to five levels of self, of which the middle one is the "self made of mind" (''[[mana]]s''). Although the text is describing the nature of the individual rather than the cosmos as a whole, it established the concept of [[mind]] as only one of a series of [[ontology|ontological]] layers of being. The Taittiriyan concept of the five selves would represent an important element of Vedantic ontology, for example the five [[koshas]] of [[Advaita Vedanta]].

Meanwhile in Greece, and coming from a philosophical-mystical rather than a yogic perspective, [[Plato]] spoke of [[Platonic realism|archetypal forms or ideas]] as the original spiritual prototypes behind the physical world. These ideas were not equivalent to mind or thought as such. But they did eventually help inspire [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonic]] (including [[Philo]]'s) and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] metaphysics in which the ideas exist in the mind of God or the Demiurge, or (according to [[Plotinus]] and hence Neoplatonism) the Divine Mind or ''[[Nous]]''. In the metaphysics of [[Proclus]], the Nous is only one level of [[Hypostasis (Neoplatonism)|hypostasis]], with higher ones like Life, Being, and Unity above it.

== Theosophical and Hermetic interpretations ==

The esoteric conception of the mental plane had to wait till the occult revival of the late 19th century, with the development of modern Theosophical, Hermetic, and Kabbalistic ideas that were to serve as the foundation for the current [[New Age]] movement.

[[H. P. Blavatsky]] taught a cosmology and ontology consisting of [[Septenary (Theosophy)|seven principles]] and seven [[Plane (cosmology)|planes]]. In her writings she aimed at showing how different spiritual systems share a common source, and therefore refers to Vedantic, Buddhist, Samkhyan, Tantric, Neoplatonic, Ancient Egyptian, Kabbalistic, and Occult systems. She relates the mind with the principle of ''Manas'', and also talks about a kosmic Manasic plane. However, the latter represents a very sublime level of consciousness which can be experienced only by enlightened beings.

In ''The Kabbalah Unveiled'', [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers|MacGregor Mathers]] divides the [[sephirot]] (apart from the lowest, ''Malkhut'', representing the physical world) of the [[Tree of Life]] into three triads: the Intellectual, Moral, and Astral triads. The Intellectual triad could be compared to the Neoplatonic ideas (Intellect = ''Nous'') and this here represents the highest subdivision.

Around the turn of the twentieth century, [[Max Théon|Max]] and [[Alma Théon]] were producing ''[[Cosmic Tradition|The Tradition]]''. This involved a [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Lurianic Kabbalistic]]-inspired cosmology in which the ineffable Godhead emanates a number of sublime worlds, the lowest of which is made up of seven or eight ''States''. The third or fourth lowest State is the Mental or Intellectual, which again corresponds to a very high, spiritual level of consciousness.

== The world of thought in the Western Wisdom Teachings ==

According to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings, immediately beyond the higher regions of the [[astral plane|desire world]] &amp;mdash; which exhibit the marked peculiarity of blending [[Substantial form|form]] and [[sound]] &amp;mdash; and before entering the world of thought (mental plane), there is the "Great Silence", where all the world seems to disappear and the spirit has the feeling of floating in an ocean of intense light: all is one [[Eternity|eternal]] [[Now (time)|now]]. The world of thought is, according to this author, divided into two regions: the "Region of Concrete Thought" (inferior) related to the [[Mental body|mind]] and the "Region of Abstract Thought" (superior) related to the third (lower) aspect of the threefold Ego, the ''Human Spirit'' aspect.

His writings, called ''[[Western Wisdom Teachings]]'', describe that the [[Akashic Records|Memory of Nature]] may be read, in an entirely different manner covering the essence of a whole life, in the highest subdivision of the ''Region of Concrete Thought'' of the ''World of Thought''.

A discipline prevalent in the West is mathematics. The field was strengthened by [[Pythagoreanism]] and [[Philosophy]] ([[Platonism]], [[Neoplatonism]]), which were, alongside ancient Egyptian philosophy, among the oldest non-mythical wisdom paradigms. Math once meant "[[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]" and is still important within [[occultism]], especially topics farther beyond the earthly. Any mathematician who considers the mental plane's [[dimensionality]] equal to or more than the earthly one defines them as "hyperplanes." Classical [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] (other precursors of Heindel) may not have defined those dimensions, but several [[neo-Theosophy|neo-Theosophists]] call the mind 5-dimensional, (i.e. in [[Einstein]]-[[Minkowski]] [[spacetime]]) [[Platonism|Platonic]] terms such as [[nous]] or [[Nous]] (human or divine mind), synonymous (in contexts) with [[logistikon]]/[[logos]] or [[first cause|Protologos]]/[[causeless cause|Logos-Alogos]], and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelean]] ([[empiricist]], including much/all [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]]) acceptance/use of the terms differ. They may reject that [[Causeless cause|Logos Alogos]] causes Protologos or [[Logos|Logoi]] cause/are [[Nous]], or that such or infinite dimensions enumerated in abstract philosophical [[logic]] have any use in semi-abstract/-concrete mathematical logic. However, contemporary philosophers are considering dimensions of [[M-theory]] physics.

== Some current definitions of the mental plane ==

The influence of [[C.W. Leadbeater]]'s work on the New Age movement has been underrated. One of Leadbeater's achievements was to make Blavatsky's difficult cosmology simpler and more understandable; for example by equating each of the [[Septenary (Theosophy)|seven principles]] or [[subtle body|vehicles of consciousness]] with a corresponding [[Plane (cosmology)|cosmic plane]]. So there is a physical body that is the vehicle of consciousness on the dense matter of the [[physical plane]]; an [[etheric body]], which is formed by the etheric matter found on subtler counterpart of the physical plane; an [[astral body]] that corresponds to the [[astral plane]]; a [[mental body]] which belongs to the lower mental plane, and a [[causal body]], or vehicle of the individual [[soul]], which is located at the level of the higher mental or [[Causal plane]].

Thus, for Leadbeater and subsequent theosophists, ex-theosophists (e.g. [[Alice Bailey]]) and occultists, the mental plane is a distinct reality or zone of being, more subtle and refined than the Astral, but denser and coarser than the Causal. A detailed account of The Mental Plane and the Mental Body and their associated phenomena, as described by Leadbeater and his co-worker [[Annie Besant]] (who succeeded Blavatsky as head of the Theosophical Society), can be found in [[Arthur E. Powell]]'s ''The Mental Body''.

[[Sri Aurobindo]] developed a very different concept of the mental plane, through his own synthesis of Vedanta (including the Taittiriya Upanishad), Tantra, Theosophy, and Theon's ideas (which he received via [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]], who was Théon's student in occultism for two years). In this cosmology, there are seven cosmic planes, three lower, corresponding to relative existence (the [[Physical (Sri Aurobindo)|Physical]], [[Vital (Sri Aurobindo)|Vital]], and [[Mental (Sri Aurobindo)|Mental]]), and four higher, representing infinite divine reality (''[[The Life Divine|Life Divine]]'' bk. 1 ch. 27). The Aurobindonian Mind or mental plane constitutes a large zone of being from the mental vital to the [[Overmind (Sri Aurobindo)|overmental]] divine region (''[[Letters on Yoga]]'', Jyoti and Prem Sobel 1984), but as with the later Theosophical concept it constitutes an objective reality of pure mind or pure thought.

Each color represents the spatial extent of a distinct genotype in a microscale model using stochastic cellular automata.

'''Microscale models''' form a broad class of [[computational model]]s that simulate fine-scale details, in contrast with '''macroscale models''', which amalgamate details into select categories.&lt;ref name="Gustafsson 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gustafsson 2007"/&gt; Microscale and macroscale models can be used together to understand different aspects of the same problem.

== Applications ==

Macroscale models can include [[ordinary differential equation|ordinary]], [[partial differential equation|partial]], and [[integro-differential equation|integro-differential]] equations, where categories and [[Flow (mathematics)|flows]] between the categories determine the dynamics, or may involve only [[algebraic equation]]s. An abstract macroscale model may be combined with more detailed microscale models. Connections between the two scales are related to [[multiscale modeling]]. One mathematical technique for multiscale modeling of nanomaterials is based upon the use of [[Multiscale Green's function]].

In contrast, microscale models can simulate a variety of details, such as individual bacteria in [[biofilm]]s,&lt;ref name="Dillon 1996"/&gt; individual pedestrians in simulated neighborhoods,&lt;ref name="Bandini 2007"/&gt; individual light beams in [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray-tracing imagery]],&lt;ref name="Gartley 2008"/&gt; individual houses in cities,&lt;ref name="OSullivan 2002"/&gt; fine-scale pores and fluid flow in batteries,&lt;ref name="Less 2012"/&gt; fine-scale compartments in meteorology,&lt;ref name="Knutz 2000"/&gt; fine-scale structures in particulate systems,&lt;ref name="Marchisio 2013"/&gt; and other models where interactions among individuals and background conditions determine the dynamics.

[[discrete event simulation|Discrete-event]] models, [[individual-based model|individual-based]] models, and [[agent-based model|agent-based]] models are special cases of microscale models. However, microscale models do not require discrete individuals or discrete events. Fine details on topography, buildings, and trees can add microscale detail to [[Microscale meteorology|meteorological simulations]] and can connect to what are called mesoscale models in that discipline.&lt;ref name="Knutz 2000"/&gt; Square-meter-sized landscape resolution available from {{Smallcaps|lidar}} images allow waterflow across land surfaces to be modeled, for example rivulets and water pockets, using gigabyte-sized arrays of detail.&lt;ref name="Barnes 2014"/&gt; Models of [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] may include individual neurons but may run in continuous time and thereby lack precise discrete events.&lt;ref name="You 1993"/&gt;

== History ==

Ideas for computational microscale models arose in the earliest days of computing and were applied to complex systems that could not accurately be described by standard mathematical forms.

Two themes emerged in the work of two founders of modern computation around the middle of the 20th century. First, pioneer [[Alan Turing]] used simplified macroscale models to understand the chemical basis of [[the chemical basis of morphogenesis|morphogenesis]], but then proposed and used computational microscale models to understand the nonlinearities and other conditions that would arise in actual biological systems.&lt;ref name="Turing 1952"/&gt; Second, pioneer [[John von Neumann]] created a [[cellular automaton]] to understand the possibilities for self-replication of arbitrarily complex entities,&lt;ref name="Burks 1966"/&gt; which had a microscale representation in the cellular automaton but no simplified macroscale form. This second theme is taken to be part of [[agent based model|agent-based models]], where the entities ultimately can be artificially intelligent agents operating autonomously.

By the last quarter of the 20th century, [[Moore's Law|computational capacity]] had grown so far&lt;ref name="Moore 1965"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berezin 2004"/&gt; that up to tens of thousands of individuals or more could be included in microscale models, and that sparse arrays could be applied to also achieve high performance.&lt;ref name="Brown 1988"/&gt; Continued increases in computing capacity allowed hundreds of millions of individuals to be simulated on ordinary computers with microscale models by the early 21st century.

The term "microscale model" arose later in the 20th century and now appears in the literature of many branches of physical and biological science.&lt;ref name="Bandini 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OSullivan 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Less 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knutz 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frind 1987"/&gt;

== Example ==

Figure&amp;nbsp;1 represents a fundamental macroscale model: [[exponential growth|population growth]] in an unlimited environment. Its equation is relevant elsewhere, such as compounding growth of [[capital (economics)|capital]] in economics or [[exponential decay]] in physics. It has one amalgamated variable, &lt;math&gt;N(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the number of individuals in the population at some time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. It has an amalgamated parameter &lt;math&gt;r=\beta-\delta&lt;/math&gt;, the annual growth rate of the population, calculated as the difference between the annual birth rate &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and the annual death rate &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. Time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; can measured in years, as shown here for illustration, or in any other suitable unit.

The macroscale model of Figure&amp;nbsp;1 amalgamates parameters and incorporates a number of simplifying approximations: 
#the birth and death rates are constant;
#all individuals are identical, with no genetics or age structure;
#fractions of individuals are meaningful;
#parameters are constant and do not evolve;
#habitat is perfectly uniform;
#no immigration or emigration occurs; and 
#randomness does not enter. 
These approximations of the macroscale model can all be refined in analogous microscale models.

On the first approximation listed above—that birth and death rates are constant—the macroscale model of the Figure&amp;nbsp;1 is exactly the mean of a large number of stochastic trials with the growth rate fluctuating randomly in each instance of time.&lt;ref name="May 1974"/&gt; Microscale stochastic details are subsumed into a partial differential [[diffusion equation]] and that equation is used to establish the equivalence.

To relax other assumptions, researchers have applied computational methods. Figure&amp;nbsp;2 is a sample computational microscale algorithm that corresponds to the macroscale model of Figure&amp;nbsp;1. When all individuals are identical and mutations in birth and death rates are disabled, the microscale dynamics closely parallel the macroscale dynamics (Figures&amp;nbsp;3A and&amp;nbsp;3B). The slight differences between the two models arise from stochastic variations in the microscale version not present in the deterministic macroscale model. These variations will be different each time the algorithm is carried out, arising from intentional variations in random number sequences.

When not all individuals are identical, the microscale dynamics can differ significantly from the macroscale dynamics, simulating more realistic situations than can be modeled at the macroscale (Figures&amp;nbsp;3C and&amp;nbsp;3D). The microscale model does not explicitly incorporate the differential equation, though for large populations it simulates it closely. When individuals differ from one another, the system has a well defined behavior but the differential equations governing that behavior are difficult to codify. The algorithm of Figure&amp;nbsp;2 is a basic example of what is called an [[equation-free modeling|equation-free model]].&lt;ref name="Kevrekidis 2009"/&gt;

When mutations are enabled in the microscale model (&lt;math&gt;\sigma&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;), the population grows more rapidly than in the macroscale model (Figures&amp;nbsp;3C and&amp;nbsp;3D). Mutations in parameters allow some individuals to have higher birth rates and others to have lower death rates, and those individuals contribute proportionally more to the population. All else being equal, the average birth rate drifts to higher values and the average death rate drifts to lower values as the simulation progresses. This drift is tracked in the data structures named ''beta'' and ''delta'' of the microscale algorithm of Figure&amp;nbsp;2.

The algorithm of Figure&amp;nbsp;2 is a simplified a microscale model using the [[Euler method]]. Other algorithms such as the Gillespie method&lt;ref name="Gillespie 1977"/&gt; and the [[discrete event simulation|discrete event method]]&lt;ref name="Brown 1988"/&gt; are also used in practice. Versions of the algorithm in practical use include efficiencies such as removing individuals from consideration once they die (to reduce memory requirements and increase speed), and scheduling stochastic events into the future (to provide a continuous time scale and to further improve speed).&lt;ref name="Brown 1988"/&gt; Such approaches can be orders of magnitude faster.

== Complexity ==

The complexity of systems addressed by microscale models leads to complexity in the models themselves, and the specification of a microscale model can be tens or hundreds of times larger than its corresponding macroscale model. (The simplified example of Figure&amp;nbsp;2 has 25 times as many lines in its specification as does Figure&amp;nbsp;1.) Since bugs occur in computer software and cannot completely be removed by standard methods such as testing,&lt;ref name="Dijkstra 1970"/&gt; and since complex models often are neither published in detail nor peer-reviewed, their validity has been called into question.&lt;ref name="Saltelli 2014"/&gt; Guidelines on best practices for microscale models exist&lt;ref name="Baxter 2006"/&gt; but no papers on the topic claim a full resolution of the problem of validating complex models.

== Future ==

Computing capacity is reaching levels where populations of entire countries or even the entire world are within the reach of microscale models, and improvements in census and travel data allow further improvements in parameterizing such models. Remote sensors from [[earth observation satellite|Earth-observing satellites]] and from ground-based observatories such as the [[National Ecological Observatory Network]] (NEON) provide large amounts of data for calibration. Potential applications range from predicting and reducing the spread of disease to helping understand the dynamics of the earth.

'''Figure&amp;nbsp;1.''' ''One of the simplest of macroscale models: an [[ordinary differential equation]] describing continuous [[exponential growth]]. &lt;math&gt;N(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the population at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;dN(t)/dt&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change through time in the single dimension &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;N(0)&lt;/math&gt; is the initial population at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a birth rate per time unit, and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is a death rate per time unit. At the left is the differential form; at the right is the explicit solution in terms of standard mathematical functions, which follows in this case from the differential form. Almost all macroscale models are more complex than this example, in that they have multiple dimensions, lack explicit solutions in terms of standard mathematical functions, and must be understood from their differential forms.''

'''Figure&amp;nbsp;2.''' ''A basic algorithm applying the [[Euler method]] to an individual-based model. See text for discussion. The algorithm,  represented in [[pseudocode]], begins with invocation of procedure &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Microscale}()&lt;/math&gt;, which uses the data structures to carry out the simulation according to the numbered steps described at the right. It repeatedly invokes function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mutation}(v)&lt;/math&gt;, which returns its parameter perturbed by a random number drawn from a uniform distribution with standard deviation defined by the variable &lt;math&gt;sigma&lt;/math&gt;. (The square root of 12 appears because the [[standard deviation]] of a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] includes that factor.) Function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Rand}()&lt;/math&gt; in the algorithm is assumed to return a uniformly distributed random number &lt;math&gt;0\le Rand()&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. The data are assumed to be reset to their initial values on each invocation of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Microscale}()&lt;/math&gt;.''

In the [[philosophy of science]], '''models of scientific inquiry''' have two functions: first, to provide a descriptive account of ''how'' scientific inquiry is carried out in practice, and second, to provide an explanatory account of ''why'' scientific inquiry succeeds as well as it appears to do in arriving at genuine knowledge.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The search for scientific knowledge ends far back into antiquity.  At some point in the past, at least by the time of Aristotle, philosophers recognized that a fundamental distinction should be drawn between two kinds of scientific knowledge—roughly, knowledge ''that'' and knowledge ''why''.  It is one thing to know ''that'' each planet periodically reverses the direction of its motion with respect to the background of fixed stars;  it is quite a different matter to know ''why''.  Knowledge of the former type is descriptive;  knowledge of the latter type is explanatory.  It is explanatory knowledge that provides scientific understanding of the world.  (Salmon, 2006, pg. 3)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Scientific inquiry refers to the diverse ways in which scientists study the natural world and propose explanations based on the evidence derived from their work."&lt;ref name=NRC-1996/&gt;

==Accounts of scientific inquiry==

===Classical model===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The classical model of scientific inquiry derives from [[Aristotle]], who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference, and also treated the compound forms such as reasoning by [[analogy]].

===Pragmatic model===
{{main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}
{{Expand section|date=February 2018}}

===Logical empiricism===
[[Wesley Salmon]] (1989)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt; began his historical survey of scientific explanation with what he called the ''received view'', as it was received from [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] in the years beginning with their ''Studies in the Logic of Explanation'' (1948) and culminating in Hempel's ''[[Aspects of Scientific Explanation and other Essays in the Philosophy of Science|Aspects of Scientific Explanation]]'' (1965).  Salmon summed up his analysis of these developments by means of the following Table.

{| class="wikitable" align="center" style="text-align:center; width:90%"
|-
! Laws / Explananda !! Particular Facts !! General Regularities
|-
! Universal Laws
| D-N

Deductive-Nomological
| D-N

Deductive-Nomological
|-
! Statistical Laws
| I-S

Inductive-Statistical
| D-S

Deductive-Statistical
|}

In this classification, a [[deductive-nomological]] (D-N) explanation of an occurrence is a valid deduction whose conclusion states that the outcome to be explained did in fact occur.  The deductive argument is called an ''explanation'', its premisses are called the ''explanans'' ([[Latin|L:]] ''explaining'') and the conclusion is called the ''explanandum'' ([[Latin|L:]] ''to be explained'').  Depending on a number of additional qualifications, an explanation may be ranked on a scale from ''potential'' to ''true''.

Not all explanations in science are of the D-N type, however.  An ''inductive-statistical'' (I-S) explanation accounts for an occurrence by subsuming it under statistical laws, rather than categorical or universal laws, and the mode of subsumption is itself inductive instead of deductive.  The D-N type can be seen as a limiting case of the more general I-S type, the measure of certainty involved being complete, or [[probability]] 1, in the former case, whereas it is less than complete, probability &amp;lt; 1, in the latter case.

In this view, the D-N mode of reasoning, in addition to being used to explain particular occurrences, can also be used to explain general regularities, simply by deducing them from still more general laws.

Finally, the ''deductive-statistical'' (D-S) type of explanation, properly regarded as a subclass of the D-N type, explains statistical regularities by deduction from more comprehensive statistical laws.  (Salmon 1989, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;.

Such was the ''received view'' of scientific explanation from the point of view of [[logical empiricism]], that Salmon says "held sway" during the third quarter of the last century (Salmon, p.&amp;nbsp;10)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;.

==Choice of a theory==
{{See also|Commensurability (philosophy of science)}}
During the course of history, one theory has succeeded another, and some have suggested further work while others have seemed content just to explain the phenomena. The reasons why one theory has replaced another are not always obvious or simple. The philosophy of science includes the question: ''What criteria are satisfied by a 'good' theory''. This question has a long history, and many scientists, as well as philosophers, have considered it. The objective is to be able to choose one theory as preferable to another without introducing [[cognitive bias]].&lt;ref name=Kuhn/&gt; Several often proposed criteria were summarized by Colyvan.&lt;ref name=Colyvan/&gt; A good theory:
# Is elegant (Formal elegance; no ''ad hoc'' modifications)
# Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements (simplicity/parsimony)
# Agrees with and explains all existing observations (unificatory/[[explanatory power]])
# Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can [[disprove]] or [[falsify]] the model if they are not borne out.
# Is fruitful: the emphasis by Colyvan is not only upon prediction and falsification, but also upon a theory's [[wikt:seminality|seminality]] in suggesting future work.

[[Stephen Hawking]] supports items 1–4, but does not mention fruitfulness.&lt;ref name=Hawking/&gt; On the other hand, Kuhn emphasizes the importance of seminality.&lt;ref name=Kuhn0/&gt;

The goal here is to make the choice between theories less arbitrary. Nonetheless, these criteria contain subjective elements, and are [[heuristics]] rather than part of [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=Simplicity/&gt; Also, criteria such as these do not necessarily decide between alternative theories. Quoting Bird:&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;
{{quote|"They [such criteria]  cannot determine scientific choice. First, which features of a theory satisfy these criteria may be disputable (''e.g.'' does simplicity concern the ontological commitments of a theory or its mathematical form?). Secondly, these criteria are imprecise, and so there is room for disagreement about the degree to which they hold. Thirdly, there can be disagreement about how they are to be weighted relative to one another, especially when they conflict." |Alexander Bird|Methodological incommensurability}}

It also is debatable whether existing scientific theories satisfy all these criteria, which may represent goals not yet achieved. For example, explanatory power over all existing observations (criterion 3) is satisfied by no one theory at the moment.&lt;ref name=Realism/&gt;
{{quote|Whatever might be the ultimate goals of some scientists, science, as it is currently practiced, depends on multiple overlapping descriptions of the world, each of which has a domain of applicability. In some cases this domain is very large, but in others quite small.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;|E.B. Davies |Epistemological pluralism, p. 4}}

The [[wikt:desiderata|desiderata]] of a "good" theory have been debated for centuries, going back perhaps even earlier than [[Occam's razor]],&lt;ref name=Desiderata/&gt; which often is taken as an attribute of a good theory. Occam's razor might fall under the heading of "elegance", the first item on the list, but too zealous an application was cautioned by [[Albert Einstein]]: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt; It is arguable that ''parsimony'' and ''elegance'' "typically pull in different directions".&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;   The falsifiability item on the list is related to the criterion proposed by Popper as demarcating a scientific theory from a theory like astrology: both "explain" observations, but the scientific theory takes the risk of making predictions that decide whether it is right or wrong:&lt;ref name=Popper1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popper0/&gt;
{{quote|"It must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience."
"Those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazard of refutation do not take part in the game of science."
|Karl Popper|The logic of scientific discovery, p. 18 and p. 280}}
[[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that changes in scientists' views of reality not only contain subjective elements, but result from group dynamics, "revolutions" in scientific practice which result in [[paradigm shift]]s.&lt;ref name=Kuhn2/&gt; As an example, Kuhn suggested that the [[heliocentric]] "[[Copernican Revolution]]" replaced the [[geocentric]] views of [[Ptolemy]] not because of empirical failures, but because of a new "paradigm" that exerted control over what scientists felt to be the more fruitful way to pursue their goals.

==Aspects of scientific inquiry==

===Deduction and induction===
[[Deductive logic]] and [[inductive logic]] are quite different in their approaches.

'''Deductive logic''' is the reasoning of proof, or [[Logical consequence|logical implication]]. It is the logic used in mathematics and other [[axiomatic system]]s such as formal logic. In a deductive system, there will be [[axiom]]s (postulates) which are not proven. Indeed, they cannot be proven without circularity. There will also be primitive terms which are not defined, as they cannot be defined without circularity. For example, one can define a line as a set of points, but to then define a point as the intersection of two lines would be circular. Because of these interesting characteristics of [[formal system]]s, Bertrand Russell humorously referred to mathematics as "the field where we don't know what we are talking about, nor whether or not what we say is true". All theorems and corollaries are proven by exploring the implications of the axiomata and other theorems that have previously been developed. New terms are defined using the primitive terms and other derived definitions based on those primitive terms.

In a deductive system, one can correctly use the term "proof", as applying to a theorem. To say that a theorem is proven means that it is impossible for the axioms to be true and the theorem to be false. For example, we could do a simple [[syllogism]] such as the following:

# [[Arches National Park]] lies within the state of [[Utah]].
# I am standing in Arches National Park.
# Therefore, I am standing in the state of Utah.

Notice that it is not possible (assuming all of the trivial qualifying criteria are supplied) to be in Arches and not be in Utah. However, one can be in Utah while not in Arches National Park. The implication only works in one direction. Statements (1) and (2) taken together imply statement (3). Statement (3) does not imply anything about statements (1) or (2). Notice that we have not proven statement (3), but we have shown that statements (1) and (2) together imply statement (3). In mathematics, what is proven is not the truth of a particular theorem, but that the axioms of the system imply the theorem. In other words, it is impossible for the axioms to be true and the theorem to be false. The strength of deductive systems is that they are sure of their results. The weakness is that they are abstract constructs which are, unfortunately, one step removed from the physical world. They are very useful, however, as mathematics has provided great insights into natural science by providing useful models of natural phenomena. One result is the development of products and processes that benefit mankind.

Learning about the physical world requires the use of '''inductive logic'''. This is the logic of theory building. It is useful in such widely divergent enterprises as science and crime scene detective work. One makes a set of observations, and seeks to explain what one sees. The observer forms a hypothesis in an attempt to explain what he/she has observed. The hypothesis will have implications, which will point to certain other observations that would naturally result from either a repeat of the experiment or making more observations from a slightly different set of circumstances. If the predicted observations hold true, one feels excitement that they may be on the right track. However, the hypothesis has not been proven. The hypothesis implies that certain observations should follow, but positive observations do not imply the hypothesis. They only make it more believable. It is quite possible that some other hypothesis could also account for the known observations, and may do better with future experiments. The implication flows in only one direction, as in the syllogism used in the discussion on deduction. Therefore, it is never correct to say that a scientific principle or hypothesis/theory has been proven. (At least, not in the rigorous sense of proof used in deductive systems.)

A classic example of this is the study of gravitation. Newton formed a law for gravitation stating that the force of gravitation is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. For over 170 years, all observations seemed to validate his equation. However, telescopes eventually became powerful enough to see a slight discrepancy in the orbit of Mercury. Scientists tried everything imaginable to explain the discrepancy, but they could not do so using the objects that would bear on the orbit of Mercury. Eventually, Einstein developed his theory of [[general relativity]] and it explained the orbit of Mercury and all other known observations dealing with gravitation. During the long period of time when scientists were making observations that seemed to validate Newton's theory, they did not, in fact, prove his theory to be true. However, it must have seemed at the time that they did. It only took one counterexample (Mercury's orbit) to prove that there was something wrong with his theory.

This is typical of inductive logic. All of the observations that seem to validate the theory, do not prove its truth. But one counter-example can prove it false.  That means that deductive logic is used in the evaluation of a theory.  In other words, if A implies B, then not B implies not A.  Einstein's theory of General Relativity has been supported by many observations using the best scientific instruments and experiments. However, his theory now has the same status as Newton's theory of gravitation prior to seeing the problems in the orbit of Mercury. It is highly credible and validated with all we know, but it is not proven. It is only the best we have at this point in time.

Another example of correct scientific reasoning is shown in the current search for the [[Higgs boson]].  Scientists on the [[Compact Muon Solenoid]] experiment at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] have conducted experiments yielding data suggesting the existence of the Higgs boson. However, realizing that the results could possibly be explained as a background fluctuation and not the Higgs boson, they are cautious and waiting for further data from future experiments.  Said Guido Tonelli:

{{Quote|"We cannot exclude the presence of the [[Standard Model]] Higgs between 115 and 127 [[GeV]] because of a modest excess of events in this mass region that appears, quite consistently, in five independent channels [...] As of today what we see is consistent either with a background fluctuation or with the presence of the boson."}}

A brief overview of the '''scientific method''' would then contain these steps as a minimum:

# Make a set of observations regarding the phenomenon being studied.
# Form a hypothesis that might explain the observations.  (Inductive Step)
# Identify the implications and outcomes that must follow, if the hypothesis is to be true.
# Perform other experiments or observations to see if any of the predicted outcomes fail.
# If any predicted outcomes fail, the hypothesis is proven false since if A implies B, then not B implies not A.  (Deductive Logic)  It is then necessary to change the hypothesis and go back to step 3.  If the predicted outcomes are confirmed, the hypothesis is not proved, but rather can be said to be consistent with known data.

When a hypothesis has survived a sufficient number of tests, it may be promoted to a [[scientific theory]].  A theory is a hypothesis that has survived many tests and seems to be consistent with other established scientific theories.  Since a theory is a promoted hypothesis, it is of the same 'logical' species and shares the same logical limitations.  Just as a hypothesis cannot be proven but can be disproved, that same is true for a theory.  It is a difference of degree, not kind.

'''Arguments from analogy''' are another type of inductive reasoning. In arguing from analogy, one infers that since two things are alike in several respects, they are likely to be alike in another respect. This is, of course, an assumption. It is natural to attempt to find similarities between two phenomena and wonder what one can learn from those similarities. However, to notice that two things share attributes in several respects does not imply any similarities in other respects. It is possible that the observer has already noticed all of the attributes that are shared and any other attributes will be distinct. Argument from analogy is an unreliable method of reasoning that can lead to erroneous conclusions, and thus cannot be used to establish scientific facts.

[[File:Martin Van Maele - La Grande Danse macabre des vifs - 01.jpg|thumb|Mooning can be used to express disrespect.]]
'''Mooning''' is the act of displaying one's bare [[buttocks]] by removing clothing, e.g., by lowering the backside of one's [[trousers]] and [[underpants]], usually bending over, whether also exposing the genitals or not. Mooning is used in the English-speaking world &lt;!-- see Talk:Mooning#geographic distribution --&gt; to express [[protest]], [[Contempt|scorn]], [[disrespect]], or provocation, or can be done for [[shock value]], [[fun]], or as a form of [[exhibitionism]]. 

Some jurisdictions regard mooning to be [[indecent exposure]], sometimes depending on the context.

==Word history==
''[[Moon]]'' has been a common shape metaphor for the [[buttocks]] in English since 1743, and the verb ''to moon'' has meant "to expose to (moon)light" since 1601.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nester |first=Daniel |title=How to be Inappropriate |publisher=Counterpoint Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-1593762537}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--, long before they were combined in US student slang in the verb(al expression) mooning "to flash the buttocks" in 1968. --&gt; As documented by McLaren, "'mooning', or exposing one's butt to shame an enemy ... had a long pedigree in peasant culture" throughout the [[Middle Ages]], and in many nations.&lt;ref name="McLaren"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Trials of Masculinity: Policing Sexual Boundaries, 1870-1930|first=Angus |last=McLaren |year=1997 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |page=186 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHTeeteHH1UC&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Mooning" is also defined as "wandering idly" and "romantically pining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=moon&amp;searchmode=term |title=Moon |work=The Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the practice of mooning was widespread by the 19th century, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates the use of "moon" and "mooning" to describe the act to student slang of the 1960s, when the gesture became increasingly popular among students at universities in the United States.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite web|title=Mooning: A History|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/06/27/mooning_a_history_when_did_people_start_baring_their_butts_as_an_insult_.html|work=browbeat: Slate's culture blog|publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=July 11, 2012|author=Forrest Wickman|date=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
The legal position related to mooning varies between [[Jurisdiction (area)|jurisdictions]]; some consider it [[indecent exposure]], while others classify it as legal self expression.

==In various countries and cultures==

===Australia===
====Victoria====
In 2016, mooning in a public place in Victoria was made a criminal offence/something for which one could be punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Vic|num_act|caoa201647o2016349|Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2016|24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
'''Whakapohane''' is the [[Māori people|Māori]] practice of baring one's buttocks with the intent to offend. It symbolises the birthing act and renders the recipient ''[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)#Noa|noa]]'' ("base").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

She stood her ground and when he had finished his objections she defended her position. 

She said that she was descended from a prior-born ancestor than the chief. She was not on ''his'' marae; she was on ''her'' marae. She exposed her genitals, telling the chief that that was where he came from. Those assembled were asked to gainsay her speech but no one came forward.

===United States===

[[File:mooning.jpg|thumb|right|Students at [[Stanford University]] conduct a "mass mooning" in May 1995. This demonstration was in protest of [[censorship in the United States|censorship in the American media]].]]

In January 2006, a [[Maryland]] [[State court (United States)|state]] [[circuit court]] determined that mooning is a form of artistic expression protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] as a form of [[freedom of speech|speech]].&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/03/AR2006010301509.html |work=Washington Post |title=Mooning Deemed 'Disgusting' but No Crime in Md. |last=Londoño |first=Ernesto |page=B01 |publisher=The Washington Post Company |date=January 4, 2006 |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|page=B6|title=Judge rules 'mooning' is not illegal in Md.|date=January 6, 2006|publisher=[[Delaware News-Journal|The News Journal]], redistributed from the [[Associated Press]]|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The court ruled that [[indecent exposure]] relates only to exposure of the genitals, adding that even though mooning was a "disgusting" and "demeaning" act to engage in, and had taken place in the presence of a minor, "If exposure of half of the buttocks constituted indecent exposure, any woman wearing a [[Thong (clothing)|thong]] at the beach at [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]] would be guilty."&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;

Defense attorneys had cited a case from 1983 of a woman who was arrested after protesting in front of the [[United States Supreme Court building|U.S. Supreme Court building]] wearing nothing but a cardboard sign that covered the front of her body. In that case, the [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals]] had ruled that indecent exposure is limited to a person's genitalia. No review of the case by a higher court took place since prosecutors dropped the case after the ruling.

In California, an appellate court found in December 2000 that mooning does not constitute indecent exposure (and, therefore, does not subject the defendant to [[sex offender]] registration laws) unless it can be proven beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct was sexually motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/california/caapp4th/85/937.html|title=In re Dallas W.

The '''motion ratio''' of a mechanism is the ratio of the displacement of the point of interest to that of another point.

The most common example is in a [[Suspension (vehicle)|vehicle's suspension]], where it is used to describe the displacement and forces in the [[spring (device)|springs]] and [[shock absorbers]]. The force in the spring is (roughly) the vertical force at the contact patch divided by the motion ratio, and the spring rate is the [[wheel rate]] multiplied by the motion ratio squared and angle correction factor.


:&lt;math&gt;IR = \frac{Spring Displacement}{Wheel Displacement}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math display="block"&gt;MR = \frac{Wheel Displacement}{Spring Displacement}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Spring rate = {Wheel rate}/{IR^2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math display="block"&gt;Spring rate = {Wheel rate}\times{MR^2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This is described as the Installation Ratio in the reference. Motion ratio is the more common term in the industry, but sometimes is used to mean the inverse of the above definition.

Motion ratio in suspension of a vehicle describes the amount of shock travel for a given amount of wheel travel. Mathematically it is the ratio of shock travel and wheel travel. The amount of force transmitted to the vehicle chassis reduces with increase in motion ratio. A motion ratio close to one is desired in vehicle for better ride and comfort. One should know the desired wheel travel of the vehicle before calculating motion ratio which depends much on the type of track the vehicle will run upon.

Selecting the appropriate ratio depends on multiple factors:

#Bending moment: To reduce the [[bending moment]] the strut point should be close to the wheel.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
#Suspension stiffness:  Suspensions tends to stiffen when the inclination of the [[shock absorber]] to horizontal tends to 90 deg.{{clarify|date=June 2018}}
#[[Half-shaft]]s:  In rear suspensions, wheel travel is constrained by the [[universal joint]]s of the half shafts. Design the motion ratio such that at maximum bounce and rebound shocks are the first components that bottom out by hitting bump stops.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2454">The '''Nordic sexual morality debate''' (Danish: ''sædelighedsfejden'', Swedish: ''sedlighetsdebatten'', Norwegian: ''sedelighetsdebatten'') was the name for a cultural movement and public debate in [[Scandinavia]] in the 1880s, where sexuality and sexual morals were discussed in newspapers, magazines, books and theatrical plays.

The topic was criticism of the contemporary sexual [[double standard]]s, in which it was socially acceptable for men to have premarital sexual experience, while women were expected to be virgins, and the contemporary view on prostitution, which was sanctioned as a "necessary evil" because of this double standard, an issue that had been raised by [[Svenska Federationen]] in 1878.  

The debate was divided in two sides: the moderate one, where [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] was the most known representative, wished to solve this double standard by demanding that men also be virgins on their wedding night, as women were. The radical one, where [[Edvard Brandes]] and [[Georg Brandes]] were the most known representatives, demanded that women be free to enjoy a sexual life prior to marriage, as men were.

[[Getting Married (collection)|''Getting Married'' (collection)]] by [[August Strindberg]] and the legal court case that surrounded it was one of the perhaps most known incidents during the debate. It also caused a debate within the literary world whether literature should touch these questions at all. Other well-known works in the debate are [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play ''A Doll's House'' (Et Dukkehjem), the novel ''Money'' (Pengar) by [[Viktoria Benedictsson]], and the novel ''Pyrhussegrar'' by [[Stella Kleve]].

Given the rapidly expanding role for genetic sequencing, synthesis, and analysis in biology, researchers have been compelled to develop alternate notations to further support the analysis and manipulation of genetic data. These notations generally exploit size, shape, and symmetry to accomplish these objectives.

USA]] | volume=83 | issue=1 | pages=4-8 | pmid=2417239 | pmc=322779}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ambiguity characters were designed to encode positional variations found among families of related genes. The IUPAC notation, including ambiguity characters and suggested mnemonics, is shown in Table 1.

Despite its broad and nearly universal acceptance, the IUPAC system has a number of limitations, which stem from its reliance on the Roman alphabet. The poor legibility of upper-case Roman characters, which are generally used when displaying genetic data, may be chief among these limitations. The value of external projections in distinguishing letters has been well documented.&lt;ref name=tinker&gt;Tinker, M. A. 1963. Legibility of Print. Iowa State University Press, Ames IA.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these projections are absent from upper case letters, which in some cases are only distinguishable by subtle internal cues. Take for example the upper case C and G used to represent cytosine and guanine. These characters generally comprise half the characters in a genetic sequence but are differentiated by a small internal tick (depending on the typeface). Nevertheless, these Roman characters are available in the [[ASCII]] character set most commonly used in textual communications, which reinforces this system's ubiquity.

Another shortcoming of the IUPAC notation arises from the fact that its eleven ambiguity characters have been selected from the remaining characters of the Roman alphabet. The authors of the notation endeavored to select ambiguity characters with logical mnemonics. For example, S is used to represent the possibility of finding cytosine or guanine at genetic loci, both of which form [S]trong cross-strand binding interactions. Conversely, the weaker interactions of thymine and adenine are represented by a W.  However, convenient mnemonics are not as readily available for the other ambiguity characters displayed in Table 1. This has made ambiguity characters difficult to use and may account for their limited application.

==Alternative visually enhanced notations==
Legibility issues associated with IUPAC-encoded genetic data have led biologists to consider alternate strategies for displaying genetic data. These creative approaches to visualizing DNA sequences have generally relied on the use of spatially distributed symbols and/or visually distinct shapes to encode lengthy nucleic acid sequences. Alternative notations for nucleotide sequences have been attempted, however general uptake has been low.  Several of these approaches are summarized below.

===Stave projection===
[[File:Stave Projection.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Stave Projection uses spatially distributed dots to enhance the legibility of [[DNA]] sequences.]]

In 1986, Cowin et al. described a novel method for visualizing DNA sequence known as the Stave Projection.&lt;ref name=cowin&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cowin | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Jellis | first2 = C. H. | last3 = Rickwood | first3 = D. | doi = 10.1093/nar/14.1.509 | title = A new method of representing DNA sequences which combines ease of visual analysis with machine readability | journal = [[Nucleic Acids Research]] | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 509–15 | year = 1986 | pmid =  
3003680| pmc =339435 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their strategy was to encode nucleotides as circles on series of horizontal bars akin to notes on musical stave. As illustrated in Figure 1, each gap on the five-line staff corresponded to one of the four DNA bases. The spatial distribution of the circles made it far easier to distinguish individual bases and compare genetic sequences than IUPAC-encoded data.

The order of the bases (from top to bottom, G, A, T, C) is chosen so that the complementary strand can be read by turning the projection upside down.

===Geometric symbols===
Zimmerman et al. took a different approach to visualizing genetic data.&lt;ref name=zimmerman&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zimmerman | first1=P. A. |first2=M. L. | last2=Spell | first3=J. | last3=Rawls | first4=T. R. | last4=Unnasch | year=1991 | title=Transformation of DNA sequence data into geometric symbols | journal=[[BioTechniques]] | volume=11 | issue=1 | pages=50-52 | pmid=1954017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than relying on spatially distributed circles to highlight genetic features, they exploited four geometrically diverse symbols found in a standard computer font to distinguish the four bases. The authors developed a simple WordPerfect macro to translate IUPAC characters into the more visually distinct symbols.

===DNA Skyline===
With the growing availability of font editors, Jarvius and Landegren devised a novel set of genetic symbols, known as the DNA Skyline font, which uses increasingly taller blocks to represent the different DNA bases.&lt;ref name=jarvius&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jarvius | first1 = J. | last2 = Landegren | first2 = U. | doi = 10.2144/000112180 | title = DNA Skyline: fonts to facilitate visual inspection of nucleic acid sequences | journal = [[BioTechniques]] | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 740 | year = 2006 | pmid =  
16774117| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While reminiscent of Cowin ''et al''.'s spatially distributed Stave Projection, the DNA Skyline font is easy to download and permits translation to and from the IUPAC notation by simply changing the font in most standard word processing applications.
===Ambigraphic notations===
[[File:AmbiScript_Page.jpg|right|thumb|150x150px|AmbiScript uses ambigrams to reflect DNA symmetries and support the manipulation and analysis of genetic data.]][[Ambigrams]] (symbols that convey different meaning when viewed in a different orientation) have been designed to mirror structural symmetries found in the DNA double helix.&lt;ref name="hofstadter2"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Douglas R. | last1=Hofstadter | year=1985 | title=Metamagical Themas: Questioning the Essence of Mind and Pattern | publisher=Basic Books | location=New York | isbn=978-0465045662}}&lt;/ref&gt; By assigning ambigraphic characters to complementary bases (i.e. guanine = b, cytosine = q, adenine = n, and thymine = u), it is possible to complement DNA sequences by simply rotating the text 180 degrees.&lt;ref name="rozak12"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Rozak | first1=D. A. | year=2006 | title=The practical and pedagogical advantages of an ambigraphic nucleic acid notation | journal=[[Nucleosides, Nucleotides &amp; Nucleic Acids]] | volume=25 | pages=807-813 | pmid=16898419 | doi=10.1080/15257770600726109}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ambigraphic nucleic acid notation also makes it easy to identify genetic palindromes, such as endonuclease restriction sites, as sections of text that can be rotated 180 degrees without changing the sequence.

One example of an [[ambigraphic]] nucleic acid notation is AmbiScript, a rationally designed nucleic acid notations that combined many of the visual and functional features of its predecessors.&lt;ref name="rozak22"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Rozak | first1=David A. | first2=Anthony J. | last2=Rozak | year=2008 | title=Simplicity, function, and legibility in an enhanced ambigraphic nucleic acid notation | journal= [[BioTechniques]] | volume=44 | issue=6 | pages=811-813 | pmid=18476835 | doi=10.2144/000112727 | url = https://www.biotechniques.com/BiotechniquesJournal/2008/May/Simplicity-function-and-legibility-in-an-enhanced-ambigraphic-nucleic-acid-notation/biotechniques-44864.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its notation also uses spatially offset characters to facilitate the visual review and analysis of genetic data. AmbiScript was also designed to indicate ambiguous nucleotide positions via compound symbols. This strategy aimed to offer a more intuitive solution to the use of ambiguity characters first proposed by the IUPAC.&lt;ref name="iupac2" /&gt; As with Jarvius and Landegren's DNA Skyline fonts, AmbiScript fonts can be downloaded and applied to IUPAC-encoded sequence data.

A '''peroneal strike''' is a temporarily disabling [[strike (attack)|blow]] to the [[common peroneal nerve]] of the leg, just above the [[knee]]. The attacker aims roughly a [[hand]] span above the exterior side of the knee, towards the back of the leg. This causes a temporary loss of [[motor control]] of the leg, accompanied by [[numbness|numbness and a painful tingling sensation]] from the point of impact all the way down the leg, usually lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes in duration.

The strike is commonly made with the knee, a [[Club (weapon)|baton]], or [[shin kick]], but can be done by anything forcefully impacting the nerve. The technique is a part of the [[pressure point]] control tactics used in [[martial art]]s and by [[law enforcement agent]]s.

This strike is similar to and utilizes the same nerve as the childhood [[prank]] of "dead-legging" someone. Repeated strong peroneal strikes can cause nerve damage and have a high chance of damaging the surrounding tissues due to the spontaneous nature of the technique and the nerve location.{{Citation needed|reason=Please give a reliable source for this assertion. Pressure Point Control Tactics/Training (PPCT) which is "Legally and medically acceptable" and deemed safe uses this nerve motor point.|date=August 2011}}

The peroneal strike was used against [[detainee]]s during the 2002 [[Bagram torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, Ahmed. ''Descent into Chaos: The U.S. and the Disaster in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia''. 2008. New York: Viking Penguin, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''precautionary principle''' (or '''precautionary approach''') generally defines actions on issues considered to be uncertain, for instance applied in assessing [[risk management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/2017/September-October%202017/precautionary-principle-full.html |title=The Precautionary Principle Under Fire |author=Rupert Read and Tim O'Riordan |date= |website=EnvironmentMagazine.org |publisher=[[Environment (magazine)|Environment]] |issue=September–October 2017 |access-date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is used by policy makers to justify discretionary decisions in situations where there is the possibility of harm from making a certain decision (e.g. taking a particular course of action) when extensive scientific knowledge on the matter is lacking. The principle implies that there is a [[social responsibility]] to protect the public from exposure to harm, when scientific investigation has found a plausible risk. These protections can be relaxed only if further scientific findings emerge that provide sound evidence that no harm will result.

In some legal systems, as in [[law of the European Union]], the application of the precautionary principle has been made a [[statutory]] requirement in some areas of law.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 191 (2) TFEU, Explanations Relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights (2007/C 303/02, OJ EU C303/35 14.12.2007 explanation on article 52 (5) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, T-13/99 Pfizer vs Council p.114-125&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding international conduct, the first endorsement of the principle was in 1982 when the [[World Charter for Nature]] was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], while its first international implementation was in 1987 through the [[Montreal Protocol]]. Soon after, the principle integrated with many other legally binding international treaties such as the [[Rio Declaration]] and [[Kyoto Protocol]].

==Origins and theory==
The concept "precautionary principle" is generally considered to have arisen in English from a translation of the German term ''[[:de:Vorsorgeprinzip|Vorsorgeprinzip]]'' in the 1980s. In 1988, Konrad von Moltke described the German concept for a British audience, which he translated into English as the precautionary principle.&lt;ref name=Christiansen&gt;Sonja Boehmer Christiansen. The Precautionary Principle in Germany: Enabling Government.  Chapter 2 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=e4vjoqgeaIMC&amp;pg Interpreting the Precautionary Principle], eds Tim O'Riordan and James Cameron Earthscan Publications Ltd, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}}

The concepts underpinning the precautionary principle pre-date the term's inception. For example, the essence of the principle is captured in a number of cautionary [[aphorism]]s such as "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure", "better safe than sorry", and "look before you leap". The precautionary principle may also be interpreted as the evolution of the "ancient-medical principle" of "[[Primum non nocere|first, do no harm]]" to apply to institutions and institutional decision-making processes rather than individuals.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2013}}

In economics, the Precautionary Principle has been analysed in terms of "the effect on rational decision-making", of "the interaction of [[irreversibility]]" and "[[uncertainty]]". Authors such as Epstein (1980)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2526180 |author=Epstein, L.S. |title=Decision-making and the temporal resolution of uncertainty |jstor=2526180 |journal=International Economic Review |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=269–283 |year=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arrow and Fischer (1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1883074 |author1=Arrow, K.J.  |author2=Fischer, A.C. |title=Environmental preservation, uncertainty and irreversibility |jstor=1883074 |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=312–9 |year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; show that "irreversibility of possible future consequences" creates a "quasi-[[Option (finance)|option]] effect" which should induce a "[[risk]]-neutral" society to favour current decisions that allow for more flexibility in the future. Gollier et al. (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0047-2727(99)00052-3 |author=Gollier, Christian, Bruno Jullien &amp; Nicolas Treich |title=Scientific Progress and Irreversibility: An Economic Interpretation of the 'Precautionary Principle' |journal=Journal of Public Economics |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=229–253 |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; conclude that "more scientific uncertainty as to the distribution of a future risk – that is, a larger variability of beliefs – should induce society to take stronger prevention measures today" p245.

==Formulations==

Many definitions of the precautionary principle exist: Precaution may be defined as "caution in advance", "caution practised in the context of uncertainty", or informed [[prudence]]. Two ideas lie at the core of the principle:&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jordan &amp; Timothy O'Riordan. Chapter 3, The precautionary principle: a legal and policy history, in [http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/91173/E83079.pdf The precautionary principle: protecting public health, the environment  and the future of our children]. Edited by: Marco Martuzzi and Joel A. Tickner. World Health Organization 2004&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}

#an expression of a need by decision-makers to anticipate harm before it occurs. Within this element lies an implicit reversal of the onus of proof: under the precautionary principle it is the responsibility of an activity-proponent to establish that the proposed activity will not (or is very unlikely to) result in significant harm.
#the concept of proportionality of the risk and the cost and feasibility of a proposed action

One of the primary foundations of the precautionary principle, and globally accepted definitions, results from the work of the [[Rio Conference]], or "[[Earth Summit]]" in 1992. The principle 15 of the [[Rio Declaration]] notes: "In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=78&amp;ArticleID=1163|title=Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|author=UNEP|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1998 [[Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle|Wingspread Statement on the Precautionary Principle]] summarises the principle this way: "When an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically."&lt;ref name="SEHN-Wingspread"&gt;Staff, Science and Environmental Health Network. 26 January 1998 [http://www.sehn.org/wing.html Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle]&lt;/ref&gt; The Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle was convened by the Science and Environmental Health Network.&lt;ref name="SEHN-Wingspread"/&gt;

In February 2000, the [[Commission of the European Communities]] noted in a ''Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle'' that, "The precautionary principle is not defined in the [[Treaties of the European Union]], which prescribes it [the Precautionary Principle] only once – to protect the environment. But in practice, its scope is much wider, and specifically where preliminary-objective-scientific-evaluation indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that potentially dangerous effects on the environment, human, animal or [and] plant health may be inconsistent with the high level of protection [for what] chosen for the Community."&lt;ref name=EU-Comm-PP&gt;Commission of the European Communities.  2 February 2000 [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-00-96_en.htm Communication From The Commission on the Precautionary Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}

The January 2000 [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]] says, in regard to controversies over [[GMO]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s: "Lack of scientific certainty due to insufficient relevant scientific information ... shall not prevent the Party of [I]mport, in order to avoid or minimize such potential adverse effects, from taking a decision, as appropriate, with regard to the import of the living modified organism in question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/2000/01/20000129%2008-44%20PM/Ch_XXVII_08_ap.pdf |title=Official text of the Cartagena Protocol |format=PDF |publisher=United Nations |date=29 January 2000 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Application==
The application of the precautionary principle is hampered by both lack of political will,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} as well as the wide range of interpretations placed on it. One study identified 14 different formulations of the principle in treaties and nontreaty declarations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Vecchia|first2=Paolo|last3=Repacholi|first3=Michael H.|date=12 May 2000|title=Science and the Precautionary Principle|journal=Science|volume=288|issue=5468|pages=979–981|doi=10.1126/science.288.5468.979|issn=0036-8075|pmid=10841718|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}|last1=Foster|first1=Kenneth R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; R.B. Stewart (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stewart, R.B. |title=Environmental Regulatory Decision Making Under Uncertainty |journal=Research in Law and Economics |volume=20 |issue= |page=76 |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reduced the precautionary principle to four basic versions:

# Scientific uncertainty should not automatically preclude regulation of activities that pose a potential risk of significant harm (Non-Preclusion PP).
# Regulatory controls should incorporate a margin of safety; activities should be limited below the level at which no adverse effect has been observed or predicted (Margin of Safety PP).
# Activities that present an uncertain potential for significant harm should be subject to best technology available requirements to minimise the risk of harm unless the proponent of the activity shows that they present no appreciable risk of harm (BAT PP).
# Activities that present an uncertain potential for significant harm should be prohibited unless the proponent of the activity shows that it presents no appreciable risk of harm (Prohibitory PP).

In deciding how to apply the principle, one may use a [[cost-benefit analysis]] that factors in both the [[opportunity cost]] of not acting, and the [[option value]] of waiting for further information before acting.{{cn|date=February 2018}} One of the difficulties of the application of the principle in modern{{vague|date=February 2018}} policy-making is that there is often an irreducible{{according to whom|date=February 2018}} conflict between different interests, so that the debate necessarily involves politics.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

=== Strong vs. weak ===
''Strong precaution'' holds that regulation is required whenever there is a possible risk to health, safety, or the environment, even if the supporting evidence is speculative and even if the economic costs of regulation are high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sachs | first = Noah M. |  title = Rescuing the Strong Precautionary Principle from its Critics | journal = University of Illinois Law Review | volume = 2011 | issue = 4 | pages = 1285–1338 | date =  | origyear = | year = 2011 | month = | url = http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2011/4/Sachs.pdf | jstor =  | doi =  | id =  | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1295–96}}  In 1982, the United Nations [[World Charter for Nature]] gave the first international recognition to the strong version of the principle, suggesting that when "potential adverse effects are not fully understood, the activities should not proceed". The widely publicised Wingspread Declaration, from a meeting of environmentalists in 1998, is another example of the strong version.&lt;ref name="goliath.ecnext.com"&gt;"The paralyzing principle: Does the precautionary principle point us in any helpful direction?"

''Weak precaution'' holds that lack of scientific evidence does not preclude action if damage would otherwise be serious and irreversible.&lt;ref name="Beyond Laws of Fear"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mandel | first = Gregory N. | author-link =  | last2 = Gathii | first2 = James Thuo | author2-link =  | title = Cost Benefit Analysis Versus the Precautionary Principle: Beyond Cass Sunstein's Laws of Fear | journal = University of Illinois Law Review | volume = 2006 | issue = 5 | pages = 1037–1079 | date = | origyear = | year = 2006 | month = | url = http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2006/5/Mandel.pdf | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

According to a publication by the [[New Zealand Treasury]] Department,

&lt;blockquote&gt; The weak version [of the Precautionary Principle] is the least restrictive and allows preventive measures to be taken in the face of uncertainty, but does not require them (eg, Rio Declaration 1992; United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change 1992). To satisfy the threshold of harm, there must be some evidence relating to both the likelihood of occurrence and the severity of consequences. Some, but not all, require consideration of the costs of precautionary measures. Weak formulations do not preclude weighing benefits against the costs. Factors other than scientific uncertainty, including economic considerations, may provide legitimate grounds for postponing action. Under weak formulations, the requirement to justify the need for action (the burden of proof) generally falls on those advocating precautionary action. No mention is made of assignment of liability for environmental harm.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Strong versions justify or require precautionary measures and some also establish liability for environmental harm, which is effectively a strong form of "polluter pays". For example, the [[Earth Charter]] states: "When knowledge is limited apply a precautionary approach ... Place the burden of proof on those who argue that a proposed activity will not cause significant harm, and make the responsible parties liable for environmental harm." Reversal of proof requires those proposing an activity to prove that the product, process or technology is sufficiently "safe" before approval is granted. Requiring proof of "no environmental harm" before any action proceeds implies the public is not prepared to accept any environmental risk, no matter what economic or social benefits may arise (Peterson, 2006). At the extreme, such a requirement could involve bans and prohibitions on entire classes of potentially threatening activities or substances (Cooney, 2005). Over time, there has been a gradual transformation of the precautionary principle from what appears in the Rio Declaration to a stronger form that arguably [by whom] acts as restraint on development in the absence of firm evidence that it will do no harm.&lt;ref&gt;"Precautionary Principle: Origins, definitions, and interpretations." Treasury Publication, Government of New Zealand. 2006. http://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/research-policy/ppp/2006/06-06/05.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== International agreements and declarations ===
The World Charter for Nature, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1982, was the first international endorsement of the precautionary principle. The principle was implemented in an international treaty as early as the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], and among other international treaties and declarations is reflected in the 1992 [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]] (signed at the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]]).

===="Principle" vs. "approach"====
&lt;blockquote&gt;No introduction to the precautionary principle would be complete without brief reference to the difference between the precautionary '''principle''' and the precautionary '''approach'''. Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration 1992 states that: "in order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall be not used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation." As Garcia (1995) pointed out, "the wording, largely similar to that of the principle, is subtly different in that: (1) it recognizes that there may be differences in local capabilities to apply the approach, and (2) it calls for cost-effectiveness in applying the approach, e.g., taking economic and social costs into account." The 'approach' is generally considered a softening of the 'principle'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As Recuerda has noted, the distinction between the 'precautionary principle' and a 'precautionary approach' is diffuse and, in some contexts, controversial. In the negotiations of international declarations, the United States has opposed the use of the term 'principle' because this term has special connotations in legal language, due to the fact that a 'principle of law` is a source of law. This means that it is compulsory, so a court can quash or confirm a decision through the application of the precautionary principle. In this sense, the precautionary principle is not a simple idea or a desideratum but a source of law. This is the legal status of the precautionary principle in the European Union. On the other hand, an 'approach' usually does not have the same meaning, although in some particular cases an approach could be binding. A precautionary approach is a particular 'lens' used to identify risk that every prudent person possesses (Recuerda, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Recuerda, M. A. |title=Dangerous interpretations of the precautionary principle and the foundational values of the European Union Food Law: Risk versus Risk |journal=Journal of Food Law &amp; Policy |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages= |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====European Union====
On 2 February 2000, the [[European Commission]] issued a Communication on the precautionary principle,&lt;ref name=EU-Comm-PP/&gt; in which it adopted a procedure for the application of this concept, but without giving a detailed definition of it. Paragraph 2 of article 191 of the [[Lisbon Treaty]] states that

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Union policy on the environment shall aim at a high level of protection taking into account the diversity of situations in the various regions of the Union. It shall be based on the precautionary principle and on the principles that preventive action should be taken, that environmental damage should as a priority be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:C:2016:202:FULL&amp;from=EN Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union] article 191, paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the adoption of the European Commission's Communication on the precautionary principle, the principle has come to inform much EU policy, including areas beyond [[environmental policy]]. As of 2006 it had been integrated into EU laws "in matters such as general product safety, the use of additives for use in animal nutrition, the incineration of waste, and the regulation of genetically modified organisms".&lt;ref name=Recuerda&gt;{{cite journal |author=Recuerda, Miguel A. |title=Risk and Reason in the European Union Law |journal=European Food and Feed Law Review |volume=5 |issue= |pages= |year=2006 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|282–83}}   Through its application in [[case law]], it has become a "general principle of EU law".&lt;ref name=Recuerda/&gt;{{rp|283}}

==== France ====

In France, the [[Charter for the Environment]] contains a formulation of the precautionary principle (article 5):
{{Block quote|When the occurrence of any damage, albeit unpredictable in the current state of scientific knowledge, may seriously and irreversibly harm the environment, public authorities shall, with due respect for the principle of precaution and the areas within their jurisdiction, ensure the implementation of procedures for risk assessment and the adoption of temporary measures commensurate with the risk involved in order to preclude the occurrence of such damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/charter_environnement.pdf ''Charter for the Environment''], [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]] (page visited on 28 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====United States====
On 18 July 2005, the City of San Francisco passed a Precautionary Principle Purchasing ordinance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.municode.com/Resources/gateway.asp?pid=14134&amp;sid=5 Municode] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205100244/http://www.municode.com/Resources/gateway.asp?pid=14134&amp;sid=5 |date=5 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which requires the city to weigh the environmental and health costs of its $600&amp;nbsp;million in annual purchases – for everything from cleaning supplies to computers. Members of the Bay Area Working Group on the Precautionary Principle including the [[Breast Cancer Fund]], helped bring this to fruition.

====Japan====
In 1997, Japan tried to use the consideration of the precautionary principle in a WTO SPS [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]] case, as Japan's requirement to test each variety of agricultural products (apples, cherries, peaches, walnuts, apricots, pears, plums and quinces) for the efficacy of treatment against codling moths was challenged.

This moth is a pest that does not occur in Japan, and whose introduction has the potential to cause serious damage. The United States claimed that it was not necessary to test each variety of a fruit for the efficacy of the treatment, and that this varietal testing requirement was unnecessarily burdensome.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

====Australia====
The most important Australian court case so far, due to its exceptionally detailed consideration of the precautionary principle, is Telstra Corporation Limited v Hornsby Shire Council.&lt;ref&gt;[2006] NSWLEC 133 (24 March 2006) [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWLEC/2006/133.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Principle was summarised by reference to the [[New South Wales|NSW]] ''Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991'', which itself provides a good definition of the principle:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poteaa1991485/s6.html|title=PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT ADMINISTRATION ACT 1991 - SECT 6 Objectives of the Authority|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"If there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reasoning for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation. In the application of the principle… decisions should be guided by:
(i) careful evaluation to avoid, wherever practicable, serious or irreversible damage to the environment; and
(ii) an assessment of risk-weighted consequence of various options".

The most significant points of Justice Preston's decision are the following findings:&lt;ref&gt;Hon. Justice Brian J Preston, (2006), 'Telstra Corporation Limited v Hornsby Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 133', ''Land and Environment Court of New South Wales''. Paragraphs 125-183. https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/549f8a6b3004262463ad5606&lt;/ref&gt;
# The principle and accompanying need to take precautionary measures is "triggered" when two prior conditions exist: a threat of serious or irreversible damage, and scientific uncertainty as to the extent of possible damage.
# Once both are satisfied, "a proportionate precautionary measure may be taken to avert the anticipated threat of environmental damage, but it should be proportionate."
# The threat of serious or irreversible damage should invoke consideration of five factors: the scale of threat (local, regional etc.); the perceived value of the threatened environment; whether the possible impacts are manageable; the level of public concern, and whether there is a rational or scientific basis for the concern.
# The consideration of the level of scientific uncertainty should involve factors which may include: what would constitute sufficient evidence; the level and kind of uncertainty; and the potential to reduce uncertainty.
# The principle shifts the burden of proof. If the principle applies, the burden shifts: "a decision maker must assume the threat of serious or irreversible environmental damage is… a reality [and] the burden of showing this threat… is negligible reverts to the proponent…"
# The precautionary principle invokes preventative action: "the principle permits the taking of preventative measures without having to wait until the reality and seriousness of the threat become fully known".
# "The precautionary principle should not be used to try to avoid all risks."
# The precautionary measures appropriate will depend on the combined effect of "the degree of seriousness and irreversibility of the threat and the degree of uncertainty… the more significant and uncertain the threat, the greater…the precaution required". "…measures should be adopted… proportionate to the potential threats".

====Philippines====
A petition filed 17 May 2013 by environmental group Greenpeace Southeast Asia and farmer-scientist coalition Masipag (''Magsasaka at Siyentipiko sa Pagpapaunlad ng Agrikultura'') asked the Appellate court to stop the planting of Bt eggplant in test fields, saying the impacts of such an undertaking to the environment, native crops and human health are still unknown.  The Court of Appeals granted the petition, citing the precautionary principle stating "when human activities may lead to threats of serious and irreversible damage to the environment that is scientifically plausible but uncertain, actions shall be taken to avoid or diminish the threat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ca.judiciary.gov.ph/cardis/SP00013.pdf |title=Greenpeace Southeast Asia (Philippines), et. al. vs. Environmental Management Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, et. al. |publisher=Republic of the Philippines Court of Appeals |location=Manila |date=17 May 2013 |accessdate=12 March 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Body Shop|Body Shop International]], a UK-based cosmetics company, included the precautionary principle in their 2006 Chemicals Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebodyshopinternational.com/NR/rdonlyres/D7F2A9D1-416A-47B8-8BC3-1E858A37F81C/0/BSI_Chemicals_Strategy.pdf |title=Chemicals Strategy |publisher=The Body Shop |date=August 2006 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environment and health ===
Fields typically concerned by the precautionary principle are the possibility of:
* [[Global warming]] or [[abrupt climate change]] in general
* [[Extinction]] of species
* Introduction of new and potentially harmful products into the environment, threatening [[biodiversity]] (e.g., [[genetically modified organisms]])
* Threats to [[public health]], due to new diseases and techniques (e.g., HIV transmitted through blood transfusion)
* Long-term effects of new technologies (e.g. [[Mobile phone radiation and health|health concerns regarding radiation from cell phones]] and other electronics communications devices)
* Persistent or acute pollution (e.g., [[asbestos]], [[endocrine disruptors]])
* Food safety (e.g., [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]])
* Other new [[biosafety]] issues (e.g., [[artificial life]], new [[molecule]]s)

The precautionary principle is often applied to [[biology|biological]] fields because changes cannot be easily [[containment|contained]] and have the potential of being global. The principle has less relevance to contained fields such as [[aeronautics]], where the few people undergoing [[risk]] have given [[informed consent]] (e.g., a [[test pilot]]). In the case of technological innovation, containment of impact tends to be more difficult if that technology can self-replicate. [[Bill Joy]] emphasised the dangers of replicating genetic technology, nanotechnology, and robotic technology in his article in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', "[[Why the future doesn't need us]]", though he does not specifically cite the precautionary principle. The application of the principle can be seen in the public policy of requiring [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] to carry out [[clinical trial]]s to show that new [[medications]] are safe.

Oxford based philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] discusses the idea of a future powerful [[superintelligence]], and the risks that we/it face should it attempt to gain atomic level control of matter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nick Bostrom]] 2003 Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence – section 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Application of the principle modifies the status of innovation and [[risk assessment]]: it is not the risk that must be avoided or amended, but a potential risk that must be prevented. Thus, in the case of regulation of scientific research, there is a third party beyond the scientist and the regulator: the consumer.

In an analysis concerning application of the precautionary principle to [[nanotechnology]], Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder posit that there are ''two forms'' of the principle, which they call the "strict form" and the "active form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crnano.org/precautionary.htm |title=Nanotechnology: Precautionary Principle Analyzed |publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology |date=January 2004 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former "requires inaction when action might pose a risk", while the latter means "choosing less risky alternatives when they are available, and [...] taking responsibility for potential risks." [[Thomas Alured Faunce]] has argued for stronger application of the precautionary principle by chemical and health technology regulators particularly in relation to Ti0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZnO nanoparticles in [[sunscreens]], biocidal nanosilver in waterways and products whose manufacture, handling or recycling exposes humans to the risk of inhaling multi-walled carbon nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Faunce TA, etal |title=Sunscreen Safety: The Precautionary Principle, The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration and Nanoparticles in Sunscreens |journal=Nanoethics |volume=2 |issue= 3|pages=231–240 |year=2008 |doi=10.1007/s11569-008-0041-z |url=http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Nanoethics%20Sunscreens%202008.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228183131/http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Nanoethics%20Sunscreens%202008.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resource management ===
[[Image:HCR.gif|thumb|right|350px|The Traffic Light colour convention, showing the concept of [[Harvest Control Rule]] (HCR), specifying when a rebuilding plan is mandatory in terms of [[precautionary approach|precautionary]] and limit reference points for [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] and [[fishing mortality|fishing mortality rate]].]]
Several natural resources like fish stocks are now managed by precautionary approach, through [[Harvest Control Rules]] (HCR) based upon the precautionary principle. The figure indicates how the principle is implemented in the [[cod]] fisheries management proposed by the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In classifying [[endangered species]], the precautionary principle means that if there is doubt about an animal's or plant's exact [[Wikipedia:Conservation status|conservation status]], the one that would cause the strongest protective measures to be realised should be chosen. Thus, a species like the [[silvery pigeon]] that might exist in considerable numbers and simply be under-recorded or might just as probably be long extinct is not classified as "data deficient" or "extinct" (which both do not require any protective action to be taken), but as "critically endangered" (the conservation status that confers the need for the strongest protection), whereas the increasingly rare, but probably not yet endangered [[emerald starling]] is classified as "data deficient", because there is urgent need for research to clarify its status rather than for conservation action to save it from extinction.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

If, for example, a large ground-water body that people use for drinking water is contaminated by bacteria (e-coli 0157 H7, campylobacter or leptospirosis) and the source of contamination is strongly suspected to be dairy cows but the exact science is not yet able to provide absolute proof, the cows should be removed from the environment until they are proved, by the dairy industry, not to be the source or until that industry ensures that such contamination will not recur.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Criticisms==
Critics of the principle use arguments similar to those against other formulations of technological conservatism.

===Internal inconsistency: applying strong PP risks causing harm===
Strong formulations of the precautionary principle, without regard to its most basic provisions that it is to be applied only where risks are potentially high AND not easily calculable, applied to the principle itself as a policy decision, may rule out its own use.&lt;ref name="Beyond Laws of Fear"/&gt;{{rp|26ff}}  The reason suggested is that preventing innovation from coming to market means that only current technology may be used, and current technology itself may cause harm or leave needs unmet; there is a risk of causing harm by blocking innovation.&lt;ref name = Guardian&gt;Brown, Tracey (9 July 2013)[https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/jul/09/precautionary-principle-blunt-instrument The precautionary principle is a blunt instrument] ''[[The Guardian]]'', Retrieved 9 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherry Seethaler.

[http://www.cast-science.org/download.cfm?PublicationID=276208&amp;File=1030ac6763c4d6f3918b92e5a1345c4b8024TR Impact of the Precautionary Principle on Feeding Current and Future Generations] CAST Issue Paper 52, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; For example, forbidding nuclear power plants based on concerns about risk means continuing to rely on power plants that burn fossil fuels, which continue to release [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref name="Beyond Laws of Fear"/&gt;{{rp|27}}  In another example, the Hazardous Air Pollutant provisions in the [[Clean Air Act (1990)|1990 amendments to the US Clean Air Act]] are an example of the Precautionary Principle where the onus is now on showing a listed compound is harmless. Under this rule no distinction is made between those air Pollutants that provide a higher or lower risk, so operators tend to choose less-examined agents that are not on the existing list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldstein BD, Carruth RS |title=Implications of the Precautionary Principle: is it a threat to science? |journal=Int J Occup Med Environ Health |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=153–61 |year=2004 |pmid=15212219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blocking innovation and progress generally===
{{See also|Fear, uncertainty and doubt}}
Because applications of strong formulations of the precautionary principle can be used to block innovation, a technology which brings advantages may be banned by precautionary principle because of its potential for negative impacts, leaving the positive benefits unrealised.&lt;ref name="Sunstein"&gt;Sunstein, Cass R.

===Vagueness and plausibility===
The precautionary principle calls for action in the face of scientific uncertainty, but some formulations do not specify the minimal threshold of plausibility of risk that acts as a "triggering" condition, so that any indication that a proposed product or activity might harm health or the environment is sufficient to invoke the principle.&lt;ref name="vandenBelt"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1104/pp.103.023531 |author=van den Belt H |title=Debating the Precautionary Principle: "Guilty until Proven Innocent" or "Innocent until Proven Guilty"? |journal=Plant Physiol. |volume=132 |issue=3 |pages=1122–6 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12857792 |pmc=526264 |url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12857792}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Ronald.

'''Prudence''' ({{lang-la|prudentia}}, [[Contraction (grammar)|contracted]] from {{lang|la|providentia}} meaning "seeing ahead, sagacity") is the ability to govern and discipline oneself by the use of [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prudence Prudence - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]. Merriam-webster.com (2012-08-31). Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt; It is classically considered to be a [[virtue]], and in particular one of the four [[Cardinal virtues]] (which are, with the three [[theological virtues]], part of the [[seven virtues]]). '''Prudentia''' is an allegorical female personification of the virtue, whose attributes are a mirror and snake, who is frequently depicted as a pair with [[Justitia]], the Roman goddess of Justice.

The word derives from the 14th-century [[Old French]] word ''prudence'', which, in turn, derives from the Latin ''prudentia'' meaning "foresight, sagacity". It is often associated with [[wisdom]], [[insight]], and [[knowledge]].  In this case, the virtue is the ability to judge between virtuous and vicious actions, not only in a general sense, but with regard to appropriate actions at a given time and place. Although prudence itself does not perform any actions, and is concerned solely with knowledge, all virtues had to be regulated by it. Distinguishing when acts are [[courage]]ous, as opposed to [[Recklessness (psychology)|reckless]] or [[Cowardice|cowardly]], is an act of prudence, and for this reason it is classified as a cardinal (pivotal) virtue.

In modern [[English language|English]], the word has become increasingly [[synonym]]ous with cautiousness.  In this sense, prudence names a reluctance to take risks, which remains a virtue with respect to unnecessary risks, but, when unreasonably extended into over-cautiousness, can become the [[vice]] of cowardice.

In the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] gives a lengthy account of the virtue [[phronesis]] ({{lang-grc|ϕρόνησις}}), traditionally translated as "prudence", although this has become increasingly problematic as the word has fallen out of common usage.  More recently ϕρόνησις has been translated by such terms as "[[Phronesis|practical wisdom]]", "practical judgment" or "rational choice".

== As the "mother" of all virtues ==
[[File:DSCN2047.JPG|thumb|Allegory of Prudence on the [[tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany]] The female face depicts Francis' daughter [[Anne of Brittany]].]]

Prudence was considered by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and later on by [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosophers]], most notably [[Thomas Aquinas]], as the cause, measure and form of all virtues. It is considered to be the ''auriga virtutum'' or the charioteer of the virtues.

It is the cause in the sense that the virtues, which are defined to be the "perfected ability" of man as a spiritual person (spiritual personhood in the classical western understanding means having [[intelligence]] and [[free will]]), achieve their "perfection" only when they are founded upon prudence, that is to say upon the perfected ability to make right decisions. For instance, a person can live [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] when he has acquired the habit of deciding correctly the actions to take in response to his instinctual cravings.

Its function is to point out which course of action is to be taken in any concrete circumstances. It has nothing to do with directly willing the good it discerns. Prudence has a directive capacity with regard to the other virtues. It lights the way and measures the arena for their exercise. Without prudence, bravery becomes foolhardiness; mercy sinks into weakness, and temperance into fanaticism. Its office is to determine for each in practice those circumstances of time, place, manner, etc. which should be observed, and which the Scholastics comprise under the term "medium rationis". So it is that while it qualifies the intellect and not the will, it is nevertheless rightly styled a moral virtue.&lt;ref name="delany"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12517b.htm Delany, Joseph. "Prudence." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 2 May 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prudence is considered the measure of moral virtues since it provides a model of ethically good actions. "The work of art is true and real by its correspondence with the pattern of its prototype in the mind of the artist. In similar fashion, the free activity of man is good by its correspondence with the pattern of prudence." ([[Josef Pieper]]) For instance, a [[stockbroker]] using his experience and all the data available to him decides that it is beneficial to sell stock A at 2PM tomorrow and buy stock B today. The content of the decision (e.g., the stock, amount, time, and means) is the product of an act of prudence, while the actual carrying out of the decision may involve other virtues like fortitude (doing it in spite of fear of failure) and justice (doing his job well out of justice to his company and his family). The actual act's "goodness" is measured against that original decision made through prudence.&lt;ref&gt;Although Aristotle himself would have considered this way of making money contemptible: "[T]hose who ply sordid trades...and those who lend small sums and at high rates...take more than they ought and from wrong sources. What is common to them is evidently sordid love of gain...[A]ll such forms of taking are mean." (''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' 1121b31)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greek and Scholastic philosophy, "form" is the specific characteristic of a thing that makes it what it is. With this language, prudence confers upon other virtues the form of its inner essence; that is, its specific character as a virtue. For instance, not all acts of telling the truth are considered good, considered as done with the virtue of honesty. What makes telling the truth a virtue is whether it is done with prudence.

== Versus imprudence, cunning and false prudence ==

In Christian understanding, the difference between prudence and cunning lies in the intent with which the decision of the context of an action is made. The Christian understanding of the world includes the existence of [[God]], the [[natural law]] and [[Morality|moral]] implications of human actions. In this context, prudence is different from cunning in that it takes into account the supernatural good. For instance, the decision of persecuted Christians to be [[martyr]]ed rather than deny their faith is considered prudent. 

According to [[Thomas Aquinas]], judgments using reasons for evil ends or using evil means are considered to be made through "cunning" and "false prudence" and not through prudence.&lt;ref name="delany"/&gt; However "imprudence" was not be considered a sin since it was not voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;St Thomas Aquinas Summa Theologica, Volume 3 (Part II, Second Section) 1602065578 2013 - p 1409 "It would seem that imprudence is not a sin. For every sin is voluntary, according to Augustine;* whereas imprudence is not voluntary, since no man wishes to be imprudent. Therefore imprudence is not a sin"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Greek term for prudence is synonymous with “forethought". People, the Ancient Greeks believed, must have enough prudence to prepare for worshiping the Olympian gods.  Exceptional were the foolish Bacchic cult, who lived an emotional and passionate lifestyle. Believing the antisexual Olympian traditions to be shameful, professors of the Bacchic cult celebrated the irrationality that governed their religion.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. History of Western Philosophy.Routledge, 1996, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integral parts ==
[[File:Justice and Prudence window, Lindfield.jpg|thumb|[[Justice]] and Prudence window, Lindfield. Third window, south chapel, All Saints Church, Lindfield, West Sussex. Made in or after 1906 by Christopher Whall.]]
Prudence is the application of universal principles to particular situations.&lt;ref name="mcmanaman"&gt;[https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/education/catholic-contributions/the-virtue-of-prudence.html McManaman, Douglas. "The Virtue of Prudence", Catholic Education Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt; "Integral parts" of virtues, in [[Scholasticism|Scholastic philosophy]], are the elements that must be present for any complete or perfect act of the virtue. The following are the integral parts of prudence:
* ''[[Memoria]]'' : accurate memory; that is, memory that is true to reality; an ability to learn from experience;&lt;ref name="mcmanaman"/&gt;
* ''Docilitas'' : an open-mindedness that recognizes variety and is able to seek and make use of the experience and authority of others;&lt;ref name="mcmanaman"/&gt;
* ''Intelligentia'' : the understanding of [[first principle]]s;
* ''Sollertia'' : shrewdness or quick-wittedness, i.e. the ability to evaluate a situation quickly;
* ''[[Ratio]]'' : Discursive reasoning and the ability to research and compare alternatives;
* ''[[Providentia]]'' : foresight&amp;nbsp;– i.e. the capacity to estimate whether particular actions can realize goals;
* ''Circumspection'' : the ability to take all relevant circumstances into account;
* ''[[:wikt:caution|Caution]]'' : the ability to mitigate risk.

== Prudential judgment ==
{{refimprove section|small=y|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Titian - Allegorie der Zeit.jpg|thumb|''[[Allegory of Prudence]]'' by [[Titian]]. To Titian, prudence was preparation, foresight and judgement from experience and human history. The three faces in the painting represent the passing of human generations, with the young facing the light while the oldest fade into shadow; the faint inscription above their heads may be translated as "From the past, the present acts prudently, lest it spoils future action".&lt;ref&gt;David Summers (1987), ''The Judgment of Sense: Renaissance Naturalism and the Rise of Aesthetics'', Cambridge University Press ({{ISBN|978-0-521-32675-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In ethics, a "prudential judgment" is one where the circumstances must be weighed to determine the correct action.  Generally, it applies to situations where two people could weigh the circumstances differently and ''ethically'' come to different conclusions.

For instance, in the theory of [[just war]], the government of a nation must weigh whether the harms they suffer are more than the harms that would be produced by their going to war against another nation that is harming them; the decision whether to go to war is therefore a prudential judgment.

In another case, a patient who has a terminal illness with no conventional treatment may hear of an experimental treatment.  To decide whether to take it would require weighing on one hand, the cost, time, possible lack of benefit, and possible pain, disability, and hastened death, and on the other hand, the possible benefit and the benefit to others of what could be learned from his case.

== In rhetoric ==
[[File:Main_ornate_of_the_facade,_Castellania_Malta.jpeg|thumb|left|Main gate of 18th-century [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]] portraying [[Lady Justice]] and [[Prudentia|Lady Prudentia]] above]]
[[Phronesis]], or practical wisdom, holds an important place in [[Rhetoric|rhetorical theory]] as a central aspect of judgment and practice. [[Aristotle]]'s notion of phronesis fits with his notes on rhetoric because neither, in his estimation, could be reduced to an ''[[episteme]]'' or a ''[[techne]]'', and both deal with the ability to deliberate about contingent, variable, or indeterminate matters.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[Cicero]] defined ''prudentia'' as a rhetorical norm in ''[[De Oratore]]'', ''[[De officiis]]'', ''[[De Inventione]]'', and ''[[De re publica]]''. He contrasts the term with ''imprudens'', young men failing to consider the consequences before they act. The ''prudens'', or those who had prudence, knew when to speak and when to stay silent. Cicero maintained that prudence was gained only through experience, and while it was applied in everyday conversation, in public discourse it was subordinated to the broader term for wisdom, ''sapientia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hariman |first=Robert |title=Prudence: classical virtue, postmodern practice |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press |year=2003 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the contemporary era, rhetorical scholars have tried to recover a robust meaning for the term. They have maintained consistency with the ancient orators, contending that prudence is an embodied persuasive resource.&lt;ref name="Jasinski"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jasinski |first=James |year=2001 |title=Sourcebook on Rhetoric |publisher=Sage Publications |page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although sets of principles or rules can be constructed in a particular culture, scholars agree that prudence cannot be derived from a set of timeless principles. Instead, through gauging the situation and through reasoned deliberation, a speaker should determine the set of values and morals by which to base his or her actions. Furthermore, scholars suggest the capacity to take into account the particularities of the situation as vital to prudential practice. For example, as rhetorical scholar Lois Self explains, "both rhetoric and phronesis are normative processes in that they involve rational principles of choice-making; both have general applicability but always require careful analysis of particulars in determining the best response to each specific situation; both ideally take into account the wholeness of human nature; and finally, both have social utility and responsibility in that both treat matter of the public good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lois |last=Self |chapter=Rhetoric and Phronesis: The Aristotelian Ideal |title=Philosophy and Rhetoric |publisher=Penn State University Press |year=1979 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Hariman]], in his examination of [[Malcolm X]], adds that "aesthetic sensibility, imitation of a performative ideal, and improvisation upon conventions of presentation" are also components of practical reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hariman |first=Robert |title=Theory without Modernity |year=1991 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small differences emerge between rhetorical scholars regarding definitions of the term and methods of analysis. [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] asserted that prudence materializes through the application of principles and can be evaluated accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gadamer|first=Hans-George |title=Truth and Method |journal=Crossroad |year=1982 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his analysis of [[Andrew Cuomo]]'s speech to the Catholic Church of Notre Dame, James Jasinski contends that prudence cannot {{clarify span|be calculated by formal matters like consequences|date=February 2015}} as it is not a ''episteme'' or ''techne''; instead, it is judged according to embodied rhetorical performance.&lt;ref name="Jasinski"/&gt; Thus, while Gadamer would judge prudence based on the execution of contingent principles, Jasinski would examine the artistry of communication in its cultural milieu between accommodation ([[compromise]]) and audacity ([[courage]]).{{clarify|date=February 2015}}

In his study of [[Machiavelli]], examining the relationship between prudence and moderation, rhetorician Eugene Garver holds that there is a middle ground between "an ethics of principles, in which those principles univocally dictate action" and "an ethics of consequences, in which the successful result is all".&lt;ref name="Garver"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garver |first=Eugene |title=Machiavelli and the History of Prudence |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=1987 |isbn=0-299-11080-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; His premise stems from Aristotle's theory of virtue as an "intermediate", in which moderation and compromise embody prudence. Yet, because valorizing moderation is not an active response, prudence entails the "transformation of moderation" into a fitting response, making it a flexible situational norm. Garver also asserts that prudential reasoning differs from "algorithmic" and "[[heuristic]]" reasoning because it is rooted in a political community, the context in which common problems regarding stability and innovation arise and call for prudential reasoning.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt;

== In economics ==
&lt;!--[[Saving]] links here --&gt;

Economists describe a [[consumer]] as "prudent" if he or she [[Saving|saves]] more when faced with [[risk]]ier future income. This additional saving is called [[precautionary saving]]. 

If a risk-averse consumer has a [[utility function]] &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; over consumption ''x'', and if &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Derivative|differentiable]], then the consumer is not prudent unless the third [[derivative]] of utility is positive, that is, &lt;math&gt;
u^{'''}\left(x\right)&gt;0
&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Sandmo |year=1970 |title=The Effect of Uncertainty on Saving Decisions |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=353–360 |jstor=2296725 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strength of the precautionary saving motive can be measured by '''absolute prudence''', which is defined as
&lt;math&gt;
-\frac{u^{'''}\left(x\right)}{u^{''}\left(x\right)}
&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, '''relative prudence''' is defined as absolute prudence, multiplied by the level of consumption. These measures are closely related to the concepts of absolute and relative [[risk aversion]] developed by [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[John W. Pratt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Kimball |year=1990 |title=Precautionary Saving in the Small and in the Large |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=53–73 |jstor=2938334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In accounting ==

In [[accounting]], prudence was long considered one of the "fundamental accounting concepts" in its determination of the time for [[revenue recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim31030.htm Tax and accountancy: 'fundamental accounting concepts'], [[HMRC]], UK. Retrieved 2011-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of prudence meant that gains should not be anticipated unless their realisation was highly probable. However, recent developments in [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] have led academic critics to accuse the international standard-setting body [[IASB]] of abandoning prudence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1808094/iasb-abandoned-prudence-professor-warns IASB has abandoned prudence, professor warns], ''[[Accountancy Age]]'', 24 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK)|British reporting standard]] FRS 18, prudence, along with consistency, was relegated to a "desirable" quality of financial information rather than fundamental concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim31032.htm Tax and accountancy: development of accountancy concepts and new objectives: FRS18], HMRC. Retrieved 2011-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Prudence was rejected for IFRS because it was seen as compromising accounts' neutrality.&lt;ref name="Lords"&gt;Rose Orlik, [http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/analysis/2039988/lords-leap-international-standards Lords took a leap on international standards], ''[[Accountancy Age]]'',  4 Apr 2011. Retrieved 2011-04-12..&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 report on the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], the British [[House of Lords]] bemoaned the demotion of prudence as a governing principle of accounting and [[Financial audit|audit]]. Their comments, however, were disputed by some leading practitioners.&lt;ref name="Lords"/&gt;

The '''Queensland Council for Civil Liberties''' (QCCL) is a voluntary organisation in Australia concerned with the protection of individual rights and [[civil liberties]]. It was founded in 1966 in order "to protect and promote the human rights and freedoms of Queensland citizens."&lt;ref name="qccl"&gt;[http://qccl.org.au Queensland Council for Civil Liberties]. Retrieved on 30 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The QCCL is regularly asked by the Government to make submissions to committees, which is how bills are made in Parliament. These submissions cover issues such as closed circuit television, abortion law reform, sentencing issues in our court system and changes to legislation already in place, which are called amendments.&lt;ref name="qccl"/&gt;

In 1979, [[Terry O'Gorman]] was elected President of the QCCL and served as president up until 1985. He again held presidency from 1990 to 1994. He is currently the Vice President of the QCCL. O'Gorman specialises in criminal law. The Fitzgerald Inquiry began in 1987 and Tony Fitzgerald, QC, was appointed as its head on 26 May. The inquiry was a turning point in the fight for [[civil rights]] and the investigation of [[police misconduct]] and corruption. During the Inquiry, Terry O'Gorman cross-examined Joh Bjelke-Petersen, who had attempted to shut down the inquiry unsuccessfully.

==History==

===Pre-council history===
The Queensland Council for Civil Liberties is a sub-branch of the [[Australian Council for Civil Liberties]], established in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Waghorne, James, and Stuart Macintyre ''Liberty: A History of Civil Liberties in Australia''. Sydney: UNSW, 2011. Print&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Council for Civil Liberties]] gives a national voice for Queensland, New South Wales and Victorian civil liberties councils.The continual violations of civil liberties in Queensland, particularly the suppression of civil rights during [[Protests against the Vietnam War]], led to the formation of the QCCL.

'''Meetings'''

On 20 June 1966, the first meeting to establish a Queensland Council for Civil Liberties was held. This meeting was disrupted by groups of left and right wing political persuasions who disagreed on how to achieve the major objectives of the Council&lt;ref name="goyr"&gt;Clarke, Eddie. ''Guardian of Your Rights:Queensland Council for Civil Liberties: A History, 1966–2007.'' Brisbane: Supreme Court of Queensland Library, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second meeting was held on 19 August 1966, but again this meeting was infiltrated by the right wing organisation The Catholic Action Group who aimed to prevent the Council obtaining a left-wing orientation. At this meeting the group dominated the newly formed council with conservative views and altered the name of this newly evolving civil liberties group to 'The Queensland Association for Civil Liberties.' Due to this takeover, many members withdrew and The Queensland Association for Civil Liberties once again changed its name, this time to the Ombudsman Association of Queensland.

A third attempt to create a Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, free of political or sectarian influence, was made at a private meeting on 19 October 1966. The development of this group succeeded and the group received recognition from both the New South Wales and Victorian Council for Civil Liberty groups.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

'''Civil liberties and the right to strike'''

Australian Governments have produced many Acts of Parliament and subsequently, various amendments to try to find a solution to striking. Meanwhile, the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties work to facilitate safe and productive striking practice&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, D.J. ''The Big Strikes''. St Lucia:University of Queensland Press, 1983. Print&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1912, the right to strike was essentially quashed by a conservative Queensland government,led by [[Digby Denham]], who passed the 1912 Industrial Peace Act in Queensland, which was an Act imposing penalties on strikers. Following this first instance of the government retaliating to strikers and subsequent strikes, The State Transport Act 1938 and The Industrial Law Amendment Act 1948 extended the power of the police to use force and arrest citizens without a warrant,effectively reducing protests and strike action.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

'''The Industrial Law Amendment Act'''

The [[1948 Queensland Railway strike]] was a strike lasting nine weeks,from February to April 1948, and concerned the wages of Railway and Locomotive workers in Queensland. It was prompted by a low-wage policy introduced by the Halon Labor Government.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, David.

Canberra: Australian Institute of Criminology, 2009. Web. 4 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Police powers were extended, and through the initiation of these acts they were given the power to arrest citizens without a warrant and use force where necessary.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt; Severe police brutality occurred during an illegal march on Saint Patrick's Day, 19 March 1948, when strikers were arrested, several demonstrators were hospitalised and union offices were raided.&lt;ref name="Baker, David 2009"/&gt; Eventually, wage increases were granted and emergency powers were revoked.

'''The State Transport Act'''

During 1966, the Government commenced severe violations to civil liberties of Queensland citizens, this time in response to anti-Vietnam War demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;O'Malley, B. "The Day the Vietnam War Riots Broke Out in Brisbane." The Courier Mail. 2009 Web. 30 Apr 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Government of Australia introduced [[conscription]] in order to send Australian troops to the Vietnam War and in response to Anti-Vietnam War protests, the Queensland Government introduced the Traffic Act.

Anti conscription marches were held throughout Australia on 5 October 1966 and Queensland was the only state in Australia where the police made misuse of the Traffic Act and arrested a number of demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;Prentice, James. "Remembering the Brisbane Protests 1965–72: The Civil Liberties Movement." Queensland Review 14.1(2007): 25–37. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Traffic Act, police permits were required to have marches or meetings, even to display placards, and permits could be refused without reason.&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, Andrew. Pig city: from the Saints to Savage Garden. St Lucia, Qld: UQP, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Laver, one of the students who got arrested, chose to be imprisoned instead of paying a fine to show his resistance of the laws and regulations used to suppress demonstrations and marches. QCCL President at the time Jim Kelly wrote in an article featured in [[The Courier-Mail]] in January 1967 that the Council supported him.

'''Free speech and the Objectionable Literature Act'''

Under the Objectionable Literature Act of 1954, the [[Parliament of Queensland]] established a Literature board of Review so that the government may outlaw the distribution of questionable publications.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Applegarth, Peter. "Civil Liberties." The Bjelke-Petersen Premiership, 1968–1983: Issues in Public Policy. Ed. Allan Patience. Melbourne: Longman Cheshire Pty Ltd, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  This meant that the review held the power to ban any and all publications that were seen to be:

*Unduly emphasizing acts of sex, horror, crime, cruelty, and violence.
*Blasphemous, indecent, obscene, or likely to be injurious to morality.
*Likely to encourage depravity, public disorder, or indictable offence.
*Otherwise calculated to injure the citizens of Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;Section10 ''Objectionable Literature Acts, 1954–1967'' (QLD) in, Crawford, Christopher "Civil Liberties, Bjelke-Petersen &amp; A Bill of Rights: Lessons for Queensland," Bond Law Review. (2009) 21:1. 29 Mar 2012 http://epublications.bond.edu.au/blr/vol21/iss1/1&lt;/ref&gt;
The board of review consisted of four men and one woman, appointed by the governor-in-council.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald, Ross 2008, pp. 348"&gt;Fitzgerald, Ross. "Censorship in Queensland 1954–83" ''Australian Journal of Politics and History''  EISSN 1467-8497, 04/2008, Volume 30, Issue 3, pp. 348 – 362&lt;/ref&gt; The board was able to ban literature without any notice of a prohibition order, nor were they required to hear representations from any publishers or distributors.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald, Ross 2008, pp. 348"/&gt; Additionally the board was able to ban future issues of a publication regardless of whether the literature had been examined or not, however bans could be lifted if the board felt the publication had been 'reconstructed'.From the establishment of the Literature Board of Review in 1954 til 1981, 607 banning orders were made in Queensland with only six being disputed before the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald, Ross 2008, pp. 348"/&gt;

'''Civil Rights Action Committee and QCCL'''

In June 1966, the Civil Rights Action Committee (CRAC) was established to seek reforms to the traffic regulations yet the Government rejected their submissions. The QCCL actively support the efforts of the CRAC. The University of Queensland Students' Union had also criticised the use of traffic legislation and the use of unnecessary police violence during the arrests of peaceful demonstrators. Furthermore, in early 1967, the Civil Liberties Co-ordination Committee (CLCC) and Students for Democratic Action, both based on the [[University of Queensland]] campus, had formed to oppose the restrictions of civil liberties.

The CLCC planned a protest march without a permit from the University to the city on 11 July 1967, but a mass meeting of students voted to postpone this until 5 September 1967 to give time for negotiations with the Queensland Government. On 7 August, Frank Gardiner, a moderate president of the Students' Union and later a vice-president of the QCCL, presented to Queensland Premier George Nicklin a submission to reform provisions of the Traffic Act and Council President Kelly and Council Secretary Lindsay Smith took part in preparing this submission.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

Cabinet made a few limited concessions but they would not concede any changes to the major point of discontent – that police could refuse permits without reason. This heightened the suspicions of civil liberties advocates that the police, acting as agents of the Government, could discriminate against groups espousing unpopular causes. "A deeply conservative State Government, under Queensland Premiers Frank Nicklin and later Joh Bjelke-Petersen, was determined to show protestors "who was boss". Marchers could be targeted, bashed by police, arrested, strip-searched, and spend at least one, and sometimes several days in the police "watch house" before release."&lt;ref name="Roma Street 1967"&gt;"Civil Liberties March and Sit-down in Roma Street, Brisbane, 1967." YouTube, 17 Jun 2011. Youtube.com. Web. 21 Mar 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On 8 September 1967, students and staff of the University of Queensland marched without a permit from the campus to the city, opposite to The Cabinet. The march was obstructed by the police before it arrived at the destination and consequently they staged a mass sit-down protest in Roma St, causing 144 arrests. "The 1967 Civil Liberties March was a turning point in student and State politics, subsequently leading to mass protests against the Vietnam War and the success of the emerging student movement in the decade to follow.&lt;ref name="Roma Street 1967"/&gt; The 1967–68 and post-1977 campaigns were the only major protests of that era anywhere in Australia where the issue was specifically about civil liberties, free speech, and the democratic "right to protest" itself." In 1972, the [[Gough Whitlam]] Federal Government defused anti-Vietnam war protests when it ended conscription and commitment to the war in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;30/04/1969 Courier Mail.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding years===

'''Membership'''

To avoid infiltration by politically motivated groups the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties made membership open to anyone who subscribed to the aims outlined in the draft constitution. The Council aimed to be both non-political, non-sectarian and neither anti-police nor anti-government.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt; Although QCCL is open to anyone, members must "subscribe to the aims of the Council of safeguarding any liberties remaining from any infringement by police of political action"&lt;ref&gt;UQ Fryer Library, Box 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the Council has faced difficulty recruiting members and has often held low membership rates. When the council first began in 1966 there was low support from University lecturers and lawyers, as people may have felt their jobs may be jeopardised for affiliating with the Council and becoming members.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

'''Communication'''

After the Council was formed on 19 October 1966, led by President Jim Kelly, the Council began establishing itself as an important civil liberties group in Queensland. They began producing information to be distributed to citizens that would inform them of their civil rights and consequently when the government made changes that impinged on citizens rights,the Council held them accountable.The QCCL has used newsletters as a form of communication between members.Due to the low membership rates, newsletter distribution over the years has been sporadic.

In 1967 the Council released its first booklet containing information that would assist citizens in their dealings with the Police. Entitled ''The Citizen and the Police'', it contained subsections such as ''Types of Arrest,After Arrest, Bail'' and ''Proceedings in Court''.This is just one example of the work the Council performed at a time when their assistance was greatly required. An updated version of this booklet under the same title was also released in 1982 by the QCCL.&lt;ref name="Geraghty, J.M 1982"&gt;Geraghty, J.M. The Citizen and the Police: A Publication of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties. Brisbane: Queensland Council for Civil Liberties.1982. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Right to Demonstrate'''

Upon deploying troops to Vietnam, anti-conscription demonstrations were held throughout Australia and such demonstrations of opinion were new to Queensland at this time. Queensland was the only State where police arrests were made, following the laws set out in the Traffic Act.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

A group who fought for civil rights prior to the formation of the QCCL was [[The Queensland Civil Liberties League]],who were active in supporting a campaign to vote no to banning the Communist Party in Australia. In 1968, one of the first moves by the Council to support freedom of speech in Queensland, was when council president [[Jim Kelly]] supported Brisbane's first Nationalist Socialist Party meeting. He was published in [[The Australian]] stating 'the Council supported the principle of freedom of speech even for repugnant doctrines such as the Nazi Party'.&lt;ref&gt;Fryer, Box 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the Coalition State government produced a Queen Street Mall Bill which increased police powers. Brisbane's Queen Street Mall featured heavily in the Council's activity for many years after. Subsequent amendments to the Bill and the passing of the Local Government (Queen Street Mall) Act Amendment Act prohibited Queen Street Mall visitors from 'preaching, haranguing, singing, chanting, miming, recitals or other entertainments' unless a permit had been obtained from the Brisbane City Council.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;  The Council continued to fight these restrictions and supported activists in their plights to allow freedom of speech in the Queen Street Mall.  In a move that proved the Council's success, a Brisbane City Council representative,David Hinchliffe, opened a Speakers' Corner in King George Square.&lt;ref&gt;Anon. "Democracy is choking on Humbug." Gold Coast Bulletin 20 May. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aboriginal Australians and Citizenship – The Mabo Legislation'''
[[File:Aboriginal Land Right Protest.jpg|thumb|right|Aboriginal Land Right Protest]]
For many years, Aboriginal Australians and their supporters fought for civil rights and legal equality without the help of the QCCL.

Upon forming, the QCCL worked with Aboriginal welfare organisations to inform Aboriginals of their rights if arrested. In 1967, the Council supported the campaign to secure an affirmative vote in the Commonwealth referendum on the welfare of Aborigines. The 1967 referendum is historically noted as the 'citizenship maker' and the 1960s decade saw the Commonwealth and State Government abandon citizenship restrictions.&lt;ref name="hiaw"&gt;Chesterman, John. Civil Rights: How Indigenous Australians Won Formal Equality. St Lucia: University of Queensland, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1967 referendum awarded Aboriginal Australians full citizenship rights and the Federal Government a mandate over Aboriginal affairs (Daniels, 11). This vote also meant Aboriginals were granted the right to be included in population statistics.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

Since the establishment of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, Australian state parliaments showed little interest in awarding Aboriginal Australians the right to land and Aboriginal Land rights were a topic of much criticism for the Queensland State Government.&lt;ref name="hiaw"/&gt; Premier [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] ruled that in 1982, Aboriginal Australians would only receive 'deeds of grant in trust' over reserve land.&lt;ref name="hiaw"/&gt; Bjelke-Petersen claimed that the Aboriginal land rights movement was little more than a plot to create a separate black nation in Australia.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

===Campaigns and activities: 1968–1976===

This was a time of great change in the fight for civil rights in Queensland. A new Premier, [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]], was sworn in during this time and many protests took place questioning this governments policies on civil liberties.
[[File:StateLibQld 1 101488.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen with [[Russell Hinze]]]]

'''Joh Bjelke-Petersen'''

[[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was elected the Premier of Queensland from 1968 until 1987. The QCCL was constantly involved with this government due to their repeated breaches of civil liberties. A substantial reason the council was created was to quell police misconduct and corruption and shortly after their formation, Bjelke-Petersen began what was concurrently described as a "corrupt and vicious regime.Police were accused of intimidatory tactics, brutality, and essentially of forming a police state in Queensland acting virtually as a private army for the regime."&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

In 1969 Bjelke-Petersen's censorship campaign extended from written publication into the theatre and prosecution began for utterances as well as written prose. As a result, Brisbane actor Norman Staines was arrested for the use of an obscene phrase during his one act performance of the play ''Norm and Ahmed''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Staines was arrested by police, locked up and charged with using an obscene expression under  ''The Vagrants, Gaming and Other Offences Act 1931–67'', as a result almost every theatre company in Brisbane attacked the existing censorship system.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald, Ross 2008, pp. 348"/&gt; This led to the promoter of the musical ''Hair'' refusing to bring the show to Brisbane theaters, in response cabinet member [[Russ Hinze]] condemned ''Hair'' as being appealing to only the 'sexually-depraved, or a group of homosexuals, lesbians, wifeswappers and spivs.'&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald, Ross 2008, pp. 348"/&gt;

'''The Springbok Tour'''

[[File:Demonstration in Brisbane against South African apartheid.jpg|thumb|left|The Springbok Tour Demonstration, 1971]]
In July 1971, an Australian Rugby team the [[Wallabies (rugby union)|Wallabies]] played a test game against the [[Springboks]], a white South African team.&lt;ref&gt;Springbok Tour. Producer Alan Hall. ABC Television. 26 Sep 2004. Web. (http://www.abc.net.au/tv/rewind/txt/s1204845.html)&lt;/ref&gt; This was at a time of growing international opposition to South Africa's racist apartheid policies, and The Springbok's visit allowed the Queensland Premier, Bjelke-Petersen, to declare a state of emergency for a month.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, Alex. "We Would Live in Peace and Tranquility and No One Would Know Anything." Australian Academic and Research Libraries 31.3(2000): 65–81. Trove. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Police violence erupted when several hundred demonstrators assembled outside a Brisbane motel on Thursday 22 July 1971 where the Springbok team was staying. Observers claimed that the police, without warning or cause, charged at the demonstrators. Another confrontation took place between demonstrators and the police on the Friday night all but stopped short of physical violence. On Saturday evening, a large number of demonstrators assembled once more outside the Tower Mill Motel and after 15 minutes of peaceful protest, a brick was thrown into the motel room and police took action to clear the road and consequently disproportionate violence was used against demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Ross. "A History of Queensland, from 1915 to the 1980s." University of Queensland Press, 1985. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A Journalist [[Hugh Lunn]] wrote that Bjelke-Petersen's state of emergency and police mobilisation resembled a full-scale operation, explaining the consequent inconvenience to the public, which accompanied the following demonstrations and police reaction, obscured the civil rights issues.&lt;ref&gt;Lunn, Hugh. "Protest goes to the dogs." Australian 26 July 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Current Vice-President of the QCCL at the time, [[Terry O'Gorman]], was first exposed to these abuses of civil rights during the Springbok Tour and when Bjelke-Petersen "declared a State of Emergency to ensure the match proceeded without incident."&lt;ref&gt;"Civil Libertarian and Criminal Lawyer Terry O'Gorman" ''ABC Local conversations with Richard Fidler'' 7 Aug 2008. Abc.net.au. Web. 7 May. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaigns and activities: 1977–1981===

This era was an extremely contentious time for civil rights in Queensland. The first inquiry into police corruption under Bjelke-Petersen's government began; a major demonstrations took place and, it was an important era for women's rights in Queensland. [[Terry O'Gorman]], one of the QCCL's most influential members, was also elected as President of the QCCL in 1979, taking over from Derek Fielding during this time.Terry O'Gorman and the QCCL members witnessed police corruption and the manner in which their clients were treated, which resulted in them "taking matters into their own hands" and secretly filming police. This would later be used as evidence against them in [[The Lucas Inquiry]].&lt;ref name="Geraghty, J.M 1982"/&gt;

'''The Lucas Inquiry'''

The Lucas Inquiry, chaired by Justice GAG Lucas, began in 1976 and was constituted to look into police corruption. It was prompted by the QCCL, along with the [[Queensland Law Society]], who demanded an inquiry after a continual stream of stories of police corruption began to surface in the media.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

The aims of this inquiry were to:

*Investigate police fabrication of evidence and testimonies;
*Protect individuals from police interrogation and harassment and;
*To discover whether police have too much power interrogating, searching and arresting citizens.&lt;ref name="Geraghty, J.M 1982"/&gt;

The Lucas Inquiry emanated from the 'Southport Betting Case,' a trial in which a number of high-ranking police officers were alleged to have fabricated evidence to clear two bookmakers of prosecution.&lt;ref name="rcip"&gt;"Report of a Commission Inquiry Persuant to Orders in Council"&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1974 two suspected 'starting price' bookmakers, Brian Leonard George Sieber and Stanley Derwent Saunders, were charged and arrested "with possession of instruments of betting." It was alleged these two men, and many other bookmakers operating in Brisbane and on the Gold Coast, were chief sources of "corrupt payments to police" in the Licensing Branch, a subsection of the Criminal Intelligence Unit. The CIU was a police department "formed to collect, record and disseminate intelligence on organized crime and corruption, and to apprehend and prosecute those involved."&lt;ref name="rcip"/&gt; In 1975, the results of the trial found neither men guilty and the loss was devastating to the campaign against both corruption and the integrity of the CIU. "The Criminal Intelligence Unit had failed to secure a prosecution in a seemingly iron-clad case-one where money was actually paid over, the vital conversations had been taped and most of the activities had been observed by members of the CIU."&lt;ref name="rcip"/&gt; This 'cover up' prompted the investigation into police behaviour, resulting in [[The Lucas Inquiry]].[[Terry O'Gorman]] said at the National Convention on Civil Liberties, held in 1976, "the conclusions on the Southport Case cast serious doubt on the reliability and integrity of inspectors in the Queensland Police Force."&lt;ref name=convention_1977&gt;{{cite book|last1=McPherson|first1=Madeleine|last2=Riggs|first2=Jennifer|title=Subject or citizen : papers and addresses given at the fifth National Convention on Civil Liberties, Brisbane July 8th to 10th, 1977|date=1977|publisher=Queensland Council for Civil Liberties|location=Brisbane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lucas report resulted in findings of significant police misconduct,corruption, assault and proof of police "planting evidence, forging warrants and fabricating confessions."&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt; "It made 57 recommendations and spoke of the urgent need to reform the entire criminal law system to help the police and protect the public."&lt;ref name="Clarke, Eddie 2007"&gt;Clarke, Eddie. Guardian of Your Rights:Queensland Council for Civil Liberties: A History, 1966–2007. Brisbane: Supreme Court of Queensland Library, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reports recommendations were that police interviews be recorded to reduce verballing. The practice of verballing relates to the "putting of damaging remarks into the mouths of suspects during police interrogation" or the "fabrication of evidence."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiktionary.org&lt;/ref&gt; O'Gorman, although praising the recommended introduction of tape recordings during police interviews, was highly critical of the report as there were no police charged with misconduct and many were even promoted.&lt;ref name="Criminal Lawyer Terry O 2008"&gt;"Civil Libertarian and Criminal Lawyer Terry O'Gorman" ABC Local conversations with Richard Fidler 7 Aug 2008. Abc.net.au. Web. 7 May. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He said "the inquiry has made the comment that here we have these officers who have not only not been proceeded against but a number of the principal offenders have been promoted. What sort of a police force do we have if the upper echelons of the police force are led to believe that mis-deeds will be rewarded by subsequent promotion."&lt;ref name=convention_1977 /&gt;

'''The Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme Demonstration.'''

On 29 July 1976, over a thousand students from [[The University of Queensland]] marched against Australian Government's financial assistance scheme for student, known as the Tertiary Education Scheme in Brisbane's central business district. Those students were on the side of better Federal Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances for students and against the government's decision on Federal education budget cuts. Bjelke-Petersen instructed the police not to grant a permit for the march, and the police stopped the march along Coronation Drive. An officer struck Rose Marie Severin,  who was a female student in the head with a baton during the struggle. This was recorded and reported on television that night and gave Severin a complicated time as a public figure regardless of her choice.&lt;ref&gt;McCallum, Alexandra. Personal Stories: Women's Activism. Queensland Review 14.1 (2007): 61–68. web.&lt;/ref&gt; A student quoted on [[The Courier-Mail]] reported that she was not a radical; she was only trying to get out of the situation when she got a crack on the head from behind. QCCL attempted to take legal action on behalf of Severin but she reluctantly dropped the charges because she did not want any more publicity in the middle of university exams so the case did not continue any further.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

'''Street Protest Ban of 1977'''

In September 1977 the Queensland Government introduced a ban on all street protests, resulting in a statewide civil liberties campaign of defiance.&lt;ref&gt;Keim, Stephen. "The State of (Civil Liberties in Queensland): New Broom – Same Dirt." Legal Service Bulletin 13.1(1988):10–11. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; This saw two thousand people arrested and fined, with another hundred being imprisoned, at a cost of almost five million dollars to the State Government.&lt;ref name="cliq"&gt;Plunkett, Mark and Ralph Summy 'Civil Liberties in Queensland: A nonviolent political campaign.' "Social Alternatives" Vol 1 no. 6/7, 1980 p 73-90&lt;/ref&gt; Bjelke-Petersen publicly announced on 4 September 1977 that "the day of the political street march is over...Don't bother to apply for a permit. You won't get one. That's government policy now."&lt;ref&gt;Bjelke-Petersen, in Patience ''The Bjelke-Petersen premiership 1968–1983 : issues in public policy''. Longman Cheshire: Melbourne. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The main purposes for the ban appear to have been; 
1. To remove a critical forum for mobilizing political pressure from the [[Anti-nuclear movement in Australia]] 
2. To ensure that shipments of [[Uranium oxide]] could continue to be transported from the [[Mary Kathleen]] mine to Brisbane and further loaded onto overseas bound vessels without disruption from demonstrators
3. To provide Bjelke-Petersen with a law and order issue for the upcoming state elections.&lt;ref name="cliq"/&gt; Under the old Traffic Act, if an applicant was refused a permit to march by the issuing authority, they would be able to appeal to the magistrate.&lt;ref name="cliq"/&gt; Instead, the new laws sent all appeals to the police commissioner which resulted in appeals not being passed. In response to this, protesters came up with the idea of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgyX_01P1do Phantom Civil Liberties Marches] where protesters would gather and march until the police and media arrived. They would then disperse, and gather together again until the media and police returned, repeating the process over and over again.&lt;ref&gt;Summy, Ralph. Bruce Dickson and Mark Plunkett. "Phantom Civil Liberties Marches – Queensland University 1978–79" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgyX_01P1do&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Censorship into the 1980s'''

In the lead up to the 1980s Queensland fell subject to many forms of censorship. In 1977 things had escalated from prosecutions and book burnings, under the introduction of the Literature Board of Review, to the statewide ban on protests and street marches. Despite the banning of marches in Queensland, numbers involved with the QCCL and similar protest groups continued to rise. Although the State Government felt that it was doing the right thing for Queenslanders, the QCCL argued that 'it is precisely these 'mob [protesters]' who got Australia out of the war in Vietnam; who stopped relations with South Africa sport; and are now joining with and broadening the trade union opposition to Fraser's uranium policy.'&lt;ref name="cliq"/&gt; Since the formation of the QCCL tens of thousands of people got involved in rallies, pickets, and abortive and secret marches for civil liberties in nearly all of Queensland's major cities.&lt;ref name="cliq"/&gt; This led to over 2000 people being arrested and some 4500 charges being given by police, despite the innumerable protest applications, all but one were denied.&lt;ref name="cliq"/&gt;

Throughout the late 1970s, more and more publications were banned reaching almost a hundred per year. In 1974 the Queensland Literature Board said that 'the prohibition of this material has nothing to do with the freedom of the individual to read... The pedlar, however, of all this whether he emerges from the lavatory of some gilded lair, must be restrained from using the magnificent services of printing, publication and distribution to present to all of us (and there is none of us immune to these depravities), the degradation of humans taking their sex as animals.'&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald, Ross 2008, pp. 348"/&gt; In 1978 the Full Court of Queensland convicted Forum magazine for its use of offensive language and the  claims to dispel public ignorance in sexual matters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Strangely enough the very next year when the Australian versions of ''Penthouse'' and ''Playboy'' hit the stands, the Board did not instantly ban them. It wasn't until 1982 that [[Australian Playboy]] was banned.  By this stage Queenslanders had begun to question the legitimacy of the board, even going so far as to call it an embarrassment to the state.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald, Ross 2008, pp. 348"/&gt;

'''Women's Rights'''

Abortion was a topic which divided and concerned the early QCCL and meant that the many inquiries they received were passed onto Women's clinics. The Council was not pro-life, they were pro-choice.

In 1976, a recommendation was made by the Federal Royal Commission on Human Relationships to support the right for a woman to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. The Councils Abortion Sub-Committee and Dr Janet Irwin presented an Abortion policy to the Council's meeting. The policy was revised and amended to note that considerations must be given to the foetus as a potential human being, this version was accepted. "The report stated that abortion was a health services that should be provided along with family planning, that a woman was the one best qualified to make the decision for herself about abortion, and that amendment should be made to the Criminal Code to enable abortions to be carried out by a registered medical practitioner or a person acting under the supervision and authority of a registered medical practitioner".&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

However, as the Government's Pregnancy Termination Control Bill contained extensive restrictions and penalties for abortion, the demonstration against abortion legislation was held in 1980. Women who claimed for their right to make their decision about abortion participated against the Bill for a violation of civil rights and discrimination against women. Members of Children by Choice, an organisation for women who believe they have rights to make a choice to have an abortion, welcomed to have civil libertarians at the demonstration.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

The Council worked to prohibit discrimination of women in the workplace on many issues; marital status, pregnancy, breastfeeding and sexual harassment and discrimination. The Federal Discrimination Act of 1984 worked to assist the International Labor Organisations convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

'''Domestic Violence'''

The issue of domestic violence was addressed some 20 years into the establishment of the QCCL, who held a public meeting on the issue in 1989.  The Domestic Violence (Family Protection) Act 1989 aimed to prevent violence between married partners or de factos. The Council made a submission in reference to the increased police powers proposed by the Act as they were concerned about the increase in police powers and the use of weapons. A Weapons Bill was introduced in 1990 and QCCL President Terry O'Gorman said "The Weapons Bill struck the correct balance between gun ownership and use on the one hand … and the crying imperative to do something positive about the unnecessary loss of life which has flowed from the ability of the disturbed or violent to buy a gun today .. and kill a stranger or a loved one tomorrow".&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, 46th Parliament, February 1990 – May 1991, 4 September 1990, pp. 3431, 3444–5&lt;/ref&gt; The Council has since supported the amendments of The Domestic Violence Act to ban offenders from possessing guns while they were under a Protection Order.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

In 2012 the Domestic and Family Violence Protection Act was amended to reflect contemporary understandings of domestic and family violence. Examples of relationships that fall under the new act are same-sex relationships &amp; "one night stands" where a child is produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcglegal.com.au/domestic-and-family-violence.html The New Domestic and Family Violence Protection Act 2012] MCG Legal. Retrieved on 2013-11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rights of Prostitutes'''

The QCCL addresses the issue of sex discrimination and many other issues relative to women's rights in prostitution. In 1991, The Council made a submission to the [[Criminal Justice Commission]] to have prostitution decriminalised on the basis that it was a waste of police resources, saying the law was hypocritical and expressing that a connection existed between the criminalisation of prostitution and police corruption.

Following the submission, the CJC released a report 'Regulating Morality – An Inquiry into Prostitution into Queensland' suggesting a three-year trial of the decriminalisation of prostitution and the move to brothels in Queensland. However, the Prostitution Laws Amendment Act 1992 was passed without the inclusion of any of the CJC's recommendations, as the government stated that these recommendations would prove "costly and unworkable."&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

The Act banned brothels, a prostitute's ability to legally advertise their services and red-light districts which meant that prostitutes were forced to walk the streets to gather work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/ACTS/1992/92AC065.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry O'Gorman]] stated in his 1992 Presidents Report that the 1992 Act would have negative health consequences on those who worked in the sex industry and an increase in police powers.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

The Councils continued rallying,creating of submissions and discussions with government officials resulted in the provision of the Prostitution Act 1999. The Act created the State's first legal boutique brothels which could be legally established by a person with no criminal convictions in commercial or industrial areas, have a maximum of five rooms and which could employ two to ten staff.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/P/ProstitutA99.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The 1999 Act proved effective for The Queensland Sex Industry and [[Terry O'Gorman]] stated in an interview in 2005 with the ABC, on Tasmania's re-working of the Sex Industry Offences Act,"What the Tasmanian Parliament have got to do is look at other models that have worked well in Australia, particularly the Queensland model, where you've got state approved brothels where prostitution in those circumstances are legal," he said.&lt;ref&gt;"Civil Libertarians Urge Rethink On Sex Industry Laws." ABC Premium News (n.d.): Australia/New Zealand Reference Centre. Web. 20 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual Rights'''

In a press release published on 28 October 1989, the QCCL states that a person's sexuality was entirely his or her own business and not the Governments and this view set the tone for the QCCL's involvement in the sexual rights of Queenslanders.&lt;ref&gt;UQ Fryer Library, Box 31
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the Council opposed the Department of Education's decision not to employ a student teacher, despite a contract, due to his sexuality. Their opposition was unsuccessful.In the following years, the Council worked to oppose discriminatory Government action against the gay community. President of the time, [[Matt Foley]] found gaps in the amended Liquor Act which forbid hotel licensees to allow drug dealers, sexual perverts, deviants and child molesters on licensed Premises, but failed to define what a 'deviant' was.

QCCL President [[Steven Keim]] campaigned against the harassment of the gay community through letters and by enlisting the help of Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs and trade, who wrote a letter to the Queensland Premier, [[Mike Ahern (Australian politician)|Mike Ahern]], urging him to change the laws. The Government refused to comply and as the Council was feeling under pressure, the Gay Law Reform Association formed. The Council supported the work of the Association as a more effective way to campaign.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt; Most recently, the Council have supported to gay and lesbian groups in seeking the recognition of single sex relationships. Single sex relationships are recognised in areas such as domestic violence, succession law, and the division of jointly owned property.&lt;ref name="qccl"/&gt;

'''Terry O'Gorman'''

In 1979, [[Terry O'Gorman]] was elected President of the QCCL and served as president up until 1985.He again held presidency from 1990 to 1994.He is currently the Vice President of the QCCL.O'Gorman specialises in criminal law, yet it was the area of Aboriginal Aid in which he first commenced his legal career.An influential member of the QCCL, "it was during the days as a university student and under the rule of Joh Bjelke-Petersen that he first became aware of the need to protect civil rights." In 2008 O'Gorman commented that "civil liberties on the streets have improved, but the battle has moved to a 'law and order auction' being played out in the media, which used to be centred around the political cycle but now appears to be a permanent fixture."&lt;ref name="Criminal Lawyer Terry O 2008"/&gt;

===Campaigns and activities: 1982–1986===

This was yet another tumultuous period for the QCCL. Another police inquiry began,The Police Complaints Tribunal,and the Commonwealth Games were held in 1982 amongst protests campaigning for Indigenous rights. By 1982, it was now obviously clear to the QCCL that none of the 57 Lucas recommendations had been implemented. More claims of corrupt policing surfaced and any police officer who 'whistle blew' on another police officer would soon find their careers destroyed.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

'''The Police Complaints Tribunal'''

This tribunal was set up in 1982 and lasted until 1990.It was yet another inquiry into police corruption and also a concerted effort to improve public opinion on accusations of corruption within the police force. The QCCL president at the time, [[Terry O'Gorman]], believed this would be better than the previous inquiry, of "police investigating themselves," although said there would still be the deterrent for persons lodging a complaint as there were limited protections for the complainant against police retaliation.O'Gorman also claimed the PCT "lacked independence, which was confirmed by a damning public revelation of police malpractice which appeared on a [[Four Corners]] episode in 1986." In one case a man claimed he was forced to make a full confession to police in response to their "threats to harm his family, and when he lodged a complaint with the PCT, it vindicated the police and totally discredited him."&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

'''The Commonwealth Games Act 1982'''

[[File:The 1982 Commonwealth Game Protest.jpg|thumb|right|A demonstration for Aboriginal land rights, marches through Brisbane during the 1982 Commonwealth Games]]
Street marches were banned during the [[1982 Commonwealth Games]], allowing police to make arrests to anyone holding a placard or circulating a booklet about any Aboriginal issue near Game venues following by the Government's approval of the Commonwealth Games Act 1982 which would in effect attempt to prevent Aborigines from bringing out Land Right's issues during the Games. Queensland police gave permits to only two marches from the centre of Brisbane to protest rallies at [[Musgrave Park, Brisbane]] before the Games. On 26 September 1982, the day the Games commenced, nearly 2,000 people marched carrying placards and banners across the [[Brisbane River]] and on 29 September, the march was reduced by half. Thirty-nine people were arrested at a demonstration on the opening of the Commonwealth Games and a few days later, police arrested 104 protesters who were charged under the Queensland Government's Commonwealth Games security laws. A further 260 protesters were also arrested within three days of the opening of the Games. However, the demonstration did not stop and continued in Melbourne. Despite the numerous arrests, these protests were considered successful for gaining national and international attention not only about the Indigenous issues but the right to protest peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;O'Conner, Brian. "400 Police Mop Up a Match." ''Daily Sun'' 8 Oct 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaigns and activities: 1987–2001===

This era was another turning point for civil rights in Queensland with the end of a controversial Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen's reign and the beginning of The Fitzgerald Inquiry. It was not until 1987 that Terry O'Gorman's brother Assistant Police Commissioner Frank O'Gorman implemented the reforms recommended by the Lucas Inquiry in 1977.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

'''The Fitzgerald Inquiry'''

The Fitzgerald Inquiry began in 1987 and Tony Fitzgerald, QC, was appointed as its head on 26 May. The inquiry was a turning point in the fight for civil rights and the investigation of police misconduct and corruption. The inquiry was 'sparked' by frequent media talk of corruption by police at the highest level, involving alleged "illegal gambling, prostitution, kickbacks and brown paper bags." Yet it was an episode on [[Four Corners]] entitled 'Moonlight State' that ignited the inquiry.&lt;ref name="cmc.qld.gov.au"&gt;"The Fitzgerald Inquiry." Crime and Misconduct Commission Queensland.http://www.cmc.qld.gov.au/about-us/our-organisation/our-background/fitzgerald-inquiry"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StateLibQld 1 103786 Tony Fitzgerald, Corruption Commissioner.jpg|thumb|left|Tony Fitzgerald]]
The inquiry's objectives were to view "five criminal identities and any corrupt links within the police force over the previous five years."Fitzgerald persuaded the Government to extend the terms of the inquiry to give him the power to investigate any criminal activities and official misconduct by the police. Members of the Council were elated with the inquiry, believing that Fitzgerald was a strong candidate for the role.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt;

The intention of the Fitzgerald report was to "usher in a bold new age of transparency, innovation and integrity in politics and public sector management."Fitzgerald envisioned a model of transparency in government, just elections,and non-corrupt policing through "the elimination of graft and gratuities;the removal of cronyism, nepotism and bias in public service appointments and decisions; and a scientifically grounded criminal justice system focused on crime prevention and progressive law reform."&lt;ref name="Prenzler, T 2009, pp. 576"&gt;Prenzler, T. 2009, "Reform in Politics, Criminal Justice and the Police in Post-Fitzgerald Queensland", Griffith Law Review, vol. 18, no. 3, pp. 576–595&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Inquiry, then president of the QCCL Terry O'Gorman cross-examined Joh Bjelke-Petersen, who had attempted to shut down the inquiry unsuccessfully. In 1987, during the process of the Fitzgerald Inquiry, it had become glaringly clear to the National Party that their leader, Bjelke Petersen, was a political liability and he was consequently forced to stand down as Premier on 1 December.

The inquiry lasted two years, heard from 339 witnesses and resulted in over 100 recommendations.Many policies recommended by the Council were endorsed in the report.  The report and recommendations of the Fitzgerald inquiry were released in July 1989 and exposed evidence that a "corrupt elite were running Queensland – politicians, police and businessmen who were criminally involved in a world of drugs, prostitution and covert deals." "Tony Fitzgerald did not want to be confined to looking just at specific allegations against specific people – he wanted the freedom to look into 'any other matter or thing appertaining to the aforesaid matters', and he did not want to look only at related matters but at any matter whether it related or not. By the time he was finished looking, the police commissioner had toppled, 30 years of National Party Government was all but over, Queensland was fundamentally altered and Fitzgerald, by giving indemnities in return for evidence, had set a new standard for commissions of inquiry."&lt;ref name="cmc.qld.gov.au"/&gt; Also after the inquiry there were encouraging reforms that occurred in regards to the legalisation of homosexuality, and a more liberal and regulated approach to gambling.&lt;ref name="Prenzler, T 2009, pp. 576"/&gt;

'''The Criminal Justice Commission'''

Operating from 1989 to 2001, The Criminal Justice Commission was a permanent institution designed to assist the implementation of the recommended reforms in the Fitzgerald Inquiry.  The Criminal Justice Commissions "is empowered under the Criminal Justice Act to investigate all cases of alleged or suspected misconduct by members of the Police Service that come to its notice from any source, including information from an anonymous source."&lt;ref&gt;"Report on an inquiry into allegations of Police Misconduct at Inala in November 1990."Criminal Justice Commission. Goprint, Brisbane. 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The CJC called for the abolishment of the Police Special Branch which held files on individuals who had shown lawful opposition toward government policies, as well as other many other reforms in the past. The QCCL's O'Gorman did not approve of the destruction of these files, until those who the files concerned,I.e. those who had participated in anti-government protests, were able to access the files themselves.&lt;ref name="goyr"/&gt; One of the Council's primary concerns was "that the CJC had broad investigative powers overriding many basic protections which citizens had been entitled to in law."For example, "the Council believed that names should not be published in CJC reports because the publication of such names with respect to findings clearly had the potential to damage individuals reputations, and prejudice any criminal proceeding that might follow."&lt;ref name="Clarke, Eddie 2007"/&gt;

In 1997 police 'move on' powers were introduced by the [[Government of Queensland]] which effectively gave police the power to 'move people on' from, "prescribed places such as shops, schools, licensed premises, railway station or shopping mall.The CMC states "police essentially have the power to move people on if they are causing anxiety to another person," yet Terry O'Gorman states "it is a sad fact that in many circumstances certain people will feel threatened by an Aboriginal person, not because of their behaviour but by the very fact that they are Indigenous." O'Gorman argues that "the effect of section 47 of the Act is that police officers are asking themselves, is this person, by the fact of who they are or what they look like, likely to cause anxiety to others and when making this determination, issues of race, apparel, state of cleanliness and social status are likely to come into play and work against minority groups, such as Indigenous Australians."&lt;ref&gt;"Police Move On Powers:A CMC Review of Their Use.Crime and Misconduct Commission Queensland.Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaigns and activities: 2002–2011===

Since 2001, the QCCL is still as relevant as it always has been.It has kept a close watch on the new police corruption commission, the Crime and Misconduct Commission, as well as drug driving and privacy laws.

'''The Crime and Misconduct Commission'''

This was a new commission formed in 2001, which is still in existence and their objectives are "to combat major crime,to improve the integrity of the Queensland public sector and reduce the incidence of misconduct in this sector." Other responsibilities of this Commission are to manage a witness protection scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmc.qld.gov.au/home/topics/police-and-the-cmc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320205855/http://www.cmc.qld.gov.au/home/topics/police-and-the-cmc |archivedate=20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Council has been critical of the CMC.For example,in 2010, the QCCL called for major reforms in the police complaints process after footage was released of Cameron Doomadgee, a man who died in the [[2004 Palm Island death in custody]].Terry O'Gorman said the system had failed as the CMC came to the conclusion that the officers being investigated over the incident "were unprofessional and part of a self- protecting police culture."&lt;ref&gt;"Palm Island Case Proves System 'Broken'.1 Dec.2010. ABC News. Australian Broadcasting Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; The Queensland Council for Civil Liberties is linked to the CMC as it is expected in many cases to "assume responsibility for ensuring the CMC review is not rushed or poorly deliberated and it is only through such proactive work that the discriminatory nature of this legislation will be sufficiently revealed.&lt;ref&gt;"Police move-on powers: A CMC review of their use." Crime and Misconduct Commission Queensland. Cmc.qld.gov.au. Web. 10 May. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Difficult Rights'''

Protecting civilian's privacy has been at the forefront of the Council's negotiations since their founding. The Council's job has been made more difficult since the introduction of social media sites and generally platforms for where a persons privacy could be jeopardised.

Also protecting the rights of criminals and in particular, the civil rights of sex offenders is an example of the difficult space the Council works in. In a recent article, following convicted child molester Dennis Ferguson's placement in Murgon, the [[Australian Council for Civil Liberties]] stated that the government must provide child molesters some form of protection from community uproar, attacks and generally restricting an individuals civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, A and Nikki Toad. "Paedophile run out of Qld Home" General Newswire 1 Feb 2005:1&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The council spoke out in 2009 over the controversial 'drug driving' laws being introduced arguing that they breach ones civil liberties and that there will be an extension of police powers that accompany this.&lt;ref&gt;Prichard, Jeremy, Alison Matthews, Raimondo Bruno, Katherine Rayment and Helen James." Detouring Civil Liberties?Drug-Driving Laws in Australia." Griffith Law Review 19.2 (2010):330–349. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 protesters in opposition to coal-seam gas mining took to the streets of Brisbane and complained of police officers taking unauthorised photos of them and asking for their contact details. QCCL president Michael Cope said at the time "police taking photos was an invasion of privacy and entirely unacceptable" and was similar to the days of Bjelke-Petersens reign when photos were taken of protesters and kept within government files.&lt;ref&gt;"Police tactics 'echo joh era'" Australia/New Zealand Reference Centre. 12.12.2010 The Sun Herald&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2010, QCCL president Michael Cope commented in [[The Courier-Mail]] on Brisbane lawyer, Alexander Stewart, who posted a YouTube video of himself smoking pages from the Bible and the Koran. The man appears to be smoking a green 'marijuana' type substance and says of the incident, "It's just a f—ing book. Who cares? It's your beliefs that matter. Quite frankly, if you are going to get upset about a book, you're taking life way too seriously." Cope commented on the event saying "I don't think on the face of it that what he's done is an offense nor do we think it should be". He said he did not believe that the anti-discrimination Act had been breached and also that "penalties had been removed from the Criminal Code for blasphemy."&lt;ref&gt;Wenham, Margaret and Alex Dickinson. "Brisbane Atheist and University Lawyer Smokes Pages from the Koran and Bible in YouTube Stunt." The Courier Mail 13 Sep 2010. Web. 13 May. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaigns and activities: 2012–present===

The Council continues to work on many issues to assist in the protection of the civil liberties of all citizens.

In 2012, [[Terry O'Gorman]] spoke out against Queensland Premier Campbell Newman's announcement he will be introducing jail terms for the possession of illegal firearms and trafficking weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Withey, Andree and Melinda Howells. "Newman's Mandatory Sentencing Plan a 'Knee-Jerk Reaction."ABC News 2 May. 2012.Abc.net.au.Web. 12 May. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the state government is looking into repealing "Labors Criminal Organisation Act, where associating with members or declared organisations" will be illegal. This has been compared to the laws which [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] enacted in his reign and has been described as an "anti association law, rather than an anti-bikie law,"  and therefore affecting ones civil liberties.The QCCL are watching developments closely.&lt;ref&gt;"Labor's bikie laws in LNP's sights." Brisbane Times 24 April.2012. Brisbanetimes.com.au. Web. 10 May. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council is also looking into the introduction of body scans at Australian airports.This is where full body scan machines at airports of which random members are selected to go through and allows screeners to detect non-metallic devices, objects and weapons concealed on a person's body, but they also reveals body outlines, organs and genitals.The Queensland Council for Civil Liberties has opposed their use, calling them "a virtual strip search." The Council is concerned about the impact of this equipment on citizens rights to privacy and has made several submissions to the state and federal Government on this particular issue.&lt;ref&gt;Ironside, Robyn. "Brisbane Airport to Bring in Body Scans in September." The Courier-Mail 3 May. 2012. TheAustralian.com.au. Web. 12 May. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Codomain2.SVG|right|thumb|350px|&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function from [[domain of a function|domain]] '''''X''''' to [[codomain]] '''''Y'''''. The yellow oval inside '''''Y''''' is the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.  Sometimes "range" refers to the image and sometimes to the codomain.]]

In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[naive set theory]], the '''range''' of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] refers to either the ''[[codomain]]'' or the ''[[image (mathematics)|image]]'' of the function, depending upon usage.  Modern usage almost always uses ''range'' to mean ''image''.

The codomain of a function is some arbitrary super-set of image.  In [[real analysis]], it is the [[real number]]s.  In [[complex analysis]], it is the [[complex number]]s.

The image of a function is the set of all outputs of the function.  The image is always a subset of the codomain.

==Distinguishing between the two uses==

As the term "range" can have different meanings, it is considered a good practice to define it the first time it is used in a textbook or article.

Older books, when they use the word "range", tend to use it to mean what is now called the [[codomain]].&lt;ref&gt;Hungerford 1974, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Childs 1990, page 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  More modern books, if they use the word "range" at all, generally use it to mean what is now called the [[image (mathematics)|image]].&lt;ref&gt;Dummit and Foote 2004, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  To avoid any confusion, a number of modern books don't use the word "range" at all.&lt;ref&gt;Rudin 1991, page 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of the two different usages, consider the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt; as it is used in [[real analysis]], that is, as a function that inputs a [[real number]] and outputs its square.  In this case, its codomain is the set of real numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, but its image is the set of non-negative real numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; is never negative if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is real.  For this function, if we use "range" to mean ''codomain'', it refers to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  When we use "range" to mean ''image'', it refers to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt;.

As an example where the range equals the codomain, consider the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 2x&lt;/math&gt;, which inputs a real number and outputs its double.  For this function, the codomain and the image are the same (the function is a [[Surjective function|surjection]]), so the word range is unambiguous; it is the set of all real numbers.

==Formal definition==

When "range" is used to mean "codomain", the image of a function ''f'' is already implicitly defined. It is (by definition of image) the (maybe trivial) subset of the "range" which equals {''y'' | there exists an ''x'' in the domain of ''f'' such that ''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}.

When "range" is used to mean "image", the range of a function ''f'' is by definition {''y'' | there exists an ''x'' in the domain of ''f'' such that ''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}.  In this case, the codomain of ''f'' must not be specified, because any codomain which contains this image as a (maybe trivial) subset will work.

In both cases, image ''f'' ⊆ range ''f'' ⊆ codomain ''f'', with at least one of the containments being equality.

[[File:Ripple　- in rail.jpg|thumb|right on water]]
A '''ripple effect''' is a situation in which, like ripples expanding across the water when an object is dropped into it, an effect from an initial state can be followed outwards incrementally.

Ripple effect is often used colloquially to mean a [[multiplier (economics)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/05/27/eveningnews/main4130453.shtml The Economic Ripple Effect Gone Awry].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]], it can be observed how social interactions can affect situations not directly related to the initial interaction,&lt;ref&gt;Development sociology By Norman Long, [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|978-0-415-23536-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2013}} and in [[Charity (practice)|charitable]] activities where information can be disseminated and passed from community to community to broaden its impact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/sep/17/tefl3 Experience needed to make VSO's 'ripple effect' work] [[The Guardian]] 17 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has been applied in [[computer science]] within the field of [[software metrics]] as a [[Programming complexity|complexity measure]].&lt;ref name="Black2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Black|first=Sue|year=2001|title=Computing ripple effect for software maintenance|journal=[[Journal of Software Maintenance and Evolution: Research and Practice]]|volume=13|issue=4|pages=263–279|issn=1532-060X|doi=10.1002/smr.233|authorlink=Sue Black (computer scientist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scott Sunken Garden''' is a historical landmark in [[Lansing, Michigan]], United States of America.

The outer foundation walls are 51 feet by 79 feet and the center is a 28 feet by 45 feet lawn. There are shorter [[limestone]] walls lining the court with raised flower beds. The west side and east sides have limestone steps leading to a small water pond below the grotto center piece. This foundation of Justice Edward Cahill's home was redesigned after 1930 by a new American immigrant, Nick Kriek. The gardening includes bulbs, annuals, perennials and a list of species introduced to the area by Kriek himself.
The garden has been maintained by the Greater Lansing Garden Club for 3 decades; they restored it after a few decades of neglect by the city.&lt;ref name="The New Citizens Press Sunday: September 26, 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tncp.net/Articles/tabid/1800/articletype/ArticleView/articleID/2475/Default.aspx |title=History of Scott Sunken Garden and Its Restoration &gt; The New Citizens Press &amp;#124; TNCP &amp;#124; Lansing Michigan News &gt; TNCP &amp;#124; Greater Lansing MI News |publisher=tncp.net|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scott Sunken Garden landmark has a list of historically significant ties including 1930's "Golden Age of American Landscaping", Immigration, Civil Rights, and Lansing's Beautification.&lt;ref name="Non-profit Community Advocacy Organized for Scott Sunken Gardens"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/scottsunkengarden |title=Scott Sunken Garden, Friends |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==

The garden appears to meet national register criteria B and C...." &lt;ref name="Robert O. Christensen, National Register Coordinator, State Historic Preservation Office, MI State Housing Development Authority"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/scott-sunken-garden-friends/national-register-coordinators-recommendation-of-scott-sunken-gardens-historical/1027945290586784 |title=National Register Coordinator’s recommendation of Scott Sunken Garden’s historical recognition as a national asset |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
"Even though the Scott House  itself – the house  that stood just west of the garden near the Jenison House/Scott Center –  that formed the central feature of the property no longer exists, the  garden stands out as a fine example of formal landscape garden design  from the early twentieth century (various dates  of construction from the mid-1920s to 1934-35 have been reported). As  far as I’ve been able to determine from all the recent discussions, the  garden is unique in Lansing as a formal garden that, designed for an  urban residential setting, dates from the early  twentieth century period when landscaped gardens and estates associated  with them reached a height of design perfection, during what has been  called the “Golden Age of American Landscape Design.” The Scott Sunken  Garden, in my mind, possesses additional significance  as a prime achievement of a local Lansing artisan, Nick or Nicolaas  Isaac Willem Kriek. Kriek (1895–1978) was born in the Netherlands and, settling in Lansing in the early 1920s, founded the Cottage Gardens  nursery in 1923. Bill Hicks, Mr. Kriek’s grandson  and today part of the still operating family-owned business, states  that Nick Kriek built the Sunken Garden for Scott, from whom he had  purchased the property on which the Cottage Gardens nursery was  established in 1923. It seems logical to think that Kriek  had a major hand in designing the garden to meet the Scotts’ wishes and  requirements. The garden also possesses importance for its direct  association with an important Lansing citizen, Richard H. Scott, who  owned the property and had the garden created. Marilyn  Lee’s 2010 history of the garden states that Scott came to Lansing in  1898 to work for auto pioneer R. E. Olds and helped organize Olds’ Reo  Motor Car Company and served as president of the company after Olds  retired in 1923."
&lt;ref name="Robert O. Christensen, National Register Coordinator, State Historic Preservation Office, MI State Housing Development Authority" /&gt;
This Scott Sunken Garden foundation is presumed to be the remains of Justice Edward Cahill's Lansing home. He moved to Lansing after serving in the Civil War and went to war serving beside African American soldiers in Michigan's 102nd USCI on a campaign through southern states. Justice Edward Cahill served in the Michigan Supreme Court in 1890.&lt;ref name="Men of Progress, Embracing Biographical Sketches of Representative Michigan Men With an Outline History of the State, Dedicated to the Newspaper Press of Michigan Detroit, Michigan Published by the Evening News Association 1900"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/137660544586/permalink/10154507434494587/ |title=Historical Society of Greater Lansing public group &amp;#124; Facebook &amp;#124; "Men of Progress" |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Cahill also concurred upholding [[Racial equality]] in USA's landmark Civil Right's "William W.

The local chapter of this national garden club has a long history with both the Scott Sunken Garden and the Scott Center. The club met at the Scott Center before it was moved to Scott Park and the Garden Club invested the financing to restoration of this landmark garden through the early 80s. The city actually fell short of original expectations and the Garden Club even paid for a restoration of the lower wall of the Scott Sunken Garden &lt;ref name="The New Citizens Press Sunday: September 26, 2010" /&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Scott Garden Grotto.jpg|thumb|]]
The city is in need of widespread upgrades to the Power Grid infrastructure inducing several substations to replace the older Eckert Substation next to the Eckert Power Station. The [[Lansing Board of Water and Light]] (LBWL) and Mayor Virg Bernero have pushed for a large Central Substation with their proposal to destroy a riverside park (Scott Park) and to remove historical integrity of its historical landmark of Scott Sunken Garden.

===LBWL Proposals===

The LBWL had submitted an original proposal to the Lansing Parks and Recreation then amended it during the review by the Lansing Planning Board. These Board's are appointed by the Mayor and their decisions are being reviewed by the Lansing City Council.

===Parkland Advocacy===

The Scott Sunken Garden caretakers of 3 decades, the Greater Lansing Garden Club, has declined the LBWL offer of the new garden wanting the historical garden to remain in tact. Each public board meeting and the public meeting held by Jessica Yorko (as Lansing City Council, 4th Ward Representative) were occupied with citizen advocates. There are multiple community organizations publicly advocating saving Scott Sunken Garden, and its Scott Park; "Preservation Lansing" has advocated this along with a list of other historical concerns in the area; [http://www.facebook.com/scottsunkengarden "Friends of Scott Sunken Garden Park"] is a non-profit advocacy organization instituted for protecting Scott Sunken Garden and its neighboring assets of the People of Lansing.

====Public Petitions====

In [[topology]] and related fields of [[mathematics]], there are several restrictions that one often makes on the kinds of [[topological space]]s that one wishes to consider. Some of these restrictions are given by the '''separation axioms'''. These are sometimes called ''Tychonoff separation axioms'', after [[Andrey Tychonoff]].

The separation axioms are [[axiom]]s only in the sense that, when defining the notion of [[topological space]], one could add these conditions as extra axioms to get a more restricted notion of what a topological space is. The modern approach is to fix once and for all the [[axiomatization]] of topological space and then speak of ''kinds'' of topological spaces.
However, the term "separation axiom" has stuck. The separation axioms are denoted with the letter "T" after the [[German language|German]] ''Trennungsaxiom'', which means "separation axiom."

The precise meanings of the terms associated with the separation axioms has varied over time, as explained in [[History of the separation axioms]]. It is important to understand the authors' definition of each condition mentioned to know exactly what they mean, especially when reading older literature.

==Preliminary definitions==
Before we define the separation axioms themselves, we give concrete meaning to the concept of separated sets (and points) in [[topological space]]s. (Separated sets are not the same as ''separated spaces'', defined in the next section.)

The separation axioms are about the use of topological means to distinguish [[disjoint set]]s and [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinct]] points. It's not enough for elements of a topological space to be distinct (that is, [[Equality (mathematics)|unequal]]); we may want them to be ''topologically distinguishable''. Similarly, it's not enough for [[subset]]s of a topological space to be disjoint; we may want them to be ''separated'' (in any of various ways). The separation axioms all say, in one way or another, that points or sets that are distinguishable or separated in some weak sense must also be distinguishable or separated in some stronger sense.

Let ''X'' be a topological space. Then two points ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'' are '''topologically distinguishable''' if they do not have exactly the same [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]]s (or equivalently the same open neighbourhoods); that is, at least one of them has a neighbourhood that is not a neighbourhood of the other (or equivalently there is an [[open set]] that one point belongs to but the other point does not).

Two points ''x'' and ''y'' are '''separated''' if each of them has a neighbourhood that is not a neighbourhood of the other; that is, neither belongs to the other's [[Closure (topology)|closure]]. More generally, two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of ''X'' are '''separated''' if each is disjoint from the other's closure. (The closures themselves do not have to be disjoint.) All of the remaining conditions for separation of sets may also be applied to points (or to a point and a set) by using singleton sets. Points ''x'' and ''y'' will be considered separated, by neighbourhoods, by closed neighbourhoods, by a continuous function, precisely by a function, if and only if their singleton sets {''x''} and {''y''} are separated according to the corresponding criterion.

Subsets ''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated by neighbourhoods''' if they have disjoint neighbourhoods. They are '''separated by closed neighbourhoods''' if they have disjoint closed neighbourhoods. They are '''separated by a continuous function''' if there exists a [[continuous function]] ''f'' from the space ''X'' to the [[real line]] '''R''' such that the [[image (function)|image]] ''f''(''A'') equals {0} and ''f''(''B'') equals {1}. Finally, they are '''precisely separated by a continuous function''' if there exists a continuous function ''f'' from ''X'' to '''R''' such that the [[preimage]] ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({0}) equals ''A'' and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({1}) equals ''B''.

These conditions are given in order of increasing strength: Any two topologically distinguishable points must be distinct, and any two separated points must be topologically distinguishable. Any two separated sets must be disjoint, any two sets separated by neighbourhoods must be separated, and so on.

For more on these conditions (including their use outside the separation axioms), see the articles [[Separated sets]] and [[Topological distinguishability]].

== Main definitions ==

These definitions all use essentially the [[#Preliminary definitions|preliminary definitions]] above.

Many of these names have alternative meanings in some of mathematical literature, as explained on [[History of the separation axioms]]; for example, the meanings of "normal" and "T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;" are sometimes interchanged, similarly "regular" and "T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;", etc. Many of the concepts also have several names; however, the one listed first is always least likely to be ambiguous.

Most of these axioms have alternative definitions with the same meaning; the definitions given here fall into a consistent pattern that relates the various notions of separation defined in the previous section. Other possible definitions can be found in the individual articles.

In all of the following definitions, ''X'' is again a [[topological space]].

* ''X'' is '''[[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]''', or ''Kolmogorov'', if any two distinct points in ''X'' are [[topological distinguishability|topologically distinguishable]]. (It will be a common theme among the separation axioms to have one version of an axiom that requires T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and one version that doesn't.)
* ''X'' is '''[[R0 space|R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]''', or ''symmetric'', if any two topologically distinguishable points in ''X'' are separated.
* ''X'' is '''[[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]''', or ''accessible'' or ''Fréchet'' or ''Tikhonov'', if any two distinct points in ''X'' are separated. Thus, ''X'' is T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if it is both T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. (Although you may say such things as "T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space", "Fréchet topology", and "Suppose that the topological space ''X'' is Fréchet", avoid saying "Fréchet space" in this context, since there is another entirely different notion of [[Fréchet space]] in [[functional analysis]].)
* ''X'' is '''[[R1 space|R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]''', or ''preregular'', if any two topologically distinguishable points in ''X'' are separated by neighbourhoods. Every R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space is also R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
* ''X'' is '''[[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]''', or ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''separated'', if any two distinct points in ''X'' are separated by neighbourhoods. Thus, ''X'' is Hausdorff if and only if it is both T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Every Hausdorff space is also T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
* ''X'' is '''[[Urysohn space|T&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt;]]''', or ''Urysohn'', if any two distinct points in ''X'' are separated by closed neighbourhoods. Every T&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt; space is also Hausdorff.
* ''X'' is '''[[completely Hausdorff space|completely Hausdorff]]''', or ''completely T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', if any two distinct points in ''X'' are separated by a continuous function. Every completely Hausdorff space is also T&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt;.
* ''X'' is '''[[regular space|regular]]''' if, given any point ''x'' and closed set ''F'' in ''X'' such that ''x'' does not belong to ''F'', they are separated by neighbourhoods. (In fact, in a regular space, any such ''x'' and ''F'' will also be separated by closed neighbourhoods.) Every regular space is also R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
* ''X'' is '''[[regular Hausdorff space|regular Hausdorff]]''', or ''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'', if it is both T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and regular.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; Every regular Hausdorff space is also T&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt;.
* ''X'' is '''[[completely regular space|completely regular]]''' if, given any point ''x'' and closed set ''F'' in ''X'' such that ''x'' does not belong to ''F'', they are separated by a continuous function. Every completely regular space is also regular.
* ''X'' is '''[[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]]''', or ''T&lt;sub&gt;3½&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''completely T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'', or ''completely regular Hausdorff'', if it is both T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and completely regular.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; Every Tychonoff space is both regular Hausdorff and completely Hausdorff.
* ''X'' is '''[[normal space|normal]]''' if any two disjoint closed subsets of ''X'' are separated by neighbourhoods. (In fact, a space is normal if and only if any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by a continuous function; this is [[Urysohn's lemma]].)
* ''X'' is '''[[normal Hausdorff space|normal Hausdorff]]''', or ''T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'', if it is both T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and normal. Every normal Hausdorff space is both Tychonoff and normal regular.
* ''X'' is '''[[completely normal space|completely normal]]''' if any two separated sets are separated by neighbourhoods. Every completely normal space is also normal.
* ''X'' is '''[[completely normal Hausdorff space|completely normal Hausdorff]]''', or ''T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''completely T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'', if it is both completely normal and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Every completely normal Hausdorff space is also normal Hausdorff.
* ''X'' is '''[[perfectly normal space|perfectly normal]]''' if any two disjoint closed sets are precisely separated by a continuous function. Every perfectly normal space is also completely normal.
* ''X'' is '''[[perfectly normal Hausdorff space|perfectly normal Hausdorff]]''', or ''T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''perfectly T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'', if it is both perfectly normal and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Every perfectly normal Hausdorff space is also completely normal Hausdorff.

==Relationships between the axioms==
The T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; axiom is special in that it can be not only added to a property (so that completely regular plus T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is Tychonoff) but also subtracted from a property (so that Hausdorff minus T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), in a fairly precise sense; see [[Kolmogorov quotient]] for more information. When applied to the separation axioms, this leads to the relationships in the table to the left below. In this table, you go from the right side to the left side by adding the requirement of T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and you go from the left side to the right side by removing that requirement, using the Kolmogorov quotient operation. (The names in parentheses given on the left side of this table are generally ambiguous or at least less well known; but they are used in the diagram below.)

Other than the inclusion or exclusion of T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the relationships between the separation axioms are indicated in the diagram to the right. In this diagram, the non-T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; version of a condition is on the left side of the slash, and the T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; version is on the right side. Letters are used for [[abbreviation]] as follows:
"P" = "perfectly", "C" = "completely", "N" = "normal", and "R" (without a subscript) = "regular". A bullet indicates that there is no special name for a space at that spot. The dash at the bottom indicates no condition.

You can combine two properties using this diagram by following the diagram upwards until both branches meet. For example, if a space is both completely normal ("CN") and completely Hausdorff ("CT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;"), then following both branches up, you find the spot "•/T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;".
Since completely Hausdorff spaces are T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (even though completely normal spaces may not be), you take the T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; side of the slash, so a completely normal completely Hausdorff space is the same as a T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; space (less ambiguously known as a completely normal Hausdorff space, as you can see in the table above).

As you can see from the diagram, normal and R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; together imply a host of other properties, since combining the two properties leads you to follow a path through the many nodes on the rightside branch. Since regularity is the most well known of these, spaces that are both normal and R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are typically called "normal regular spaces". In a somewhat similar fashion, spaces that are both normal and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are often called "normal Hausdorff spaces" by people that wish to avoid the ambiguous "T" notation. These conventions can be generalised to other regular spaces and Hausdorff spaces.

==Other separation axioms==
There are some other conditions on topological spaces that are sometimes classified with the separation axioms, but these don't fit in with the usual separation axioms as completely. Other than their definitions, they aren't discussed here; see their individual articles.

* ''X'' is '''[[sober space|sober]]''' if, for every closed set ''C'' that is not the (possibly nondisjoint) union of two smaller closed sets, there is a unique point ''p'' such that the closure of {''p''} equals ''C''. More briefly, every irreducible closed set has a unique generic point. Any Hausdorff space must be sober, and any sober space must be T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
* ''X'' is '''[[weak Hausdorff space|weak Hausdorff]]''' if, for every continuous map ''f'' to ''X'' from a compact Hausdorff space, the image of ''f'' is closed in ''X''. Any Hausdorff space must be weak Hausdorff, and any weak Hausdorff space must be T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
* ''X'' is '''[[semiregular space|semiregular]]''' if the [[regular open set]]s form a [[base (topology)|base]] for the open sets of ''X''. Any regular space must also be semiregular.
* ''X'' is '''[[quasi-regular space|quasi-regular]]''' if for any nonempty open set ''G'', there is a nonempty open set ''H'' such that the closure of ''H'' is contained in ''G''.
* ''X'' is '''[[fully normal space|fully normal]]''' if every [[open cover]] has an open [[star refinement]]. ''X'' is '''[[fully T4 space|fully T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]''', or '''fully normal Hausdorff''', if it is both T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and fully normal. Every fully normal space is normal and every fully T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space is T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, one can show that every fully T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space is [[paracompact]]. In fact, fully normal spaces actually have more to do with paracompactness than with the usual separation axioms.

{{Zen Buddhism}}
'''Shoshin''' ([[wikt:初心|初心]]) is a word from [[Zen Buddhism]] meaning "'''beginner's mind.'''"  It refers to having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a beginner would. The term is especially used in the study of [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Japanese martial arts]].{{cn|date=May 2014}}

The phrase is also discussed in the book ''[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]'' by [[Shunryu Suzuki]], a Zen teacher. Suzuki outlines the framework behind shoshin, noting "in the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind|first=Shunryu|last=Suzuki|year=1970|isbn=9780834800793|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5781">In [[mathematics]], more precisely in [[differential geometry]], a '''soldering''' (or sometimes '''solder form''') of a [[fiber bundle]] to a [[smooth manifold]] is a manner of attaching the fibres to the manifold in such a way that they can be regarded as tangent.  Intuitively, soldering expresses in abstract terms the idea that a manifold may have a point of [[contact (mathematics)|contact]] with a certain model [[Klein geometry]] at each point.  In extrinsic differential geometry, the soldering is simply expressed by the tangency of the model space to the manifold.  In intrinsic geometry, other techniques are needed to express it.  Soldering was introduced in this general form by [[Charles Ehresmann]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soldering of a fibre bundle==
Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold, and ''G'' a [[Lie group]], and let ''E'' be a smooth fibre bundle over ''M'' with structure group ''G''.  Suppose that ''G'' [[group action|acts transitively]] on the typical fibre ''F'' of ''E'', and that dim ''F'' = dim ''M''.  A '''soldering''' of ''E'' to ''M'' consists of the following data:
# A distinguished [[section (fiber bundle)|section]]  ''o'' : ''M'' → ''E''.
# A linear isomorphism of vector bundles θ : T''M'' → ''o''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;V''E'' from the [[tangent bundle]] of ''M'' to the [[pullback bundle|pullback]] of the [[vertical bundle]] of ''E'' along the distinguished section.
In particular, this latter condition can be interpreted as saying that θ determines a linear isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_x : T_xM\rightarrow V_{o(x)} E&lt;/math&gt;
from the tangent space of ''M'' at ''x'' to the (vertical) tangent space of the fibre at the point determined by the distinguished section.  The form θ is called the '''solder form''' for the soldering.

==Special cases==

===Affine bundles and vector bundles===
Suppose that ''E'' is an affine [[vector bundle]] (a vector bundle without a choice of zero section).  Then a soldering on ''E'' specifies first a ''distinguished section'': that is, a choice of zero section ''o'', so that ''E'' may be identified as a vector bundle.  The solder form is then a linear isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\theta\colon TM \to V_oE,&lt;/math&gt;
However, for a vector bundle there is a canonical isomorphism between the vertical space at the origin and the fibre V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''E'' ≈ ''E''.  Making this identification, the solder form is specified by a linear isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;TM \to E.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, a soldering on an [[affine bundle]] ''E'' is a choice of isomorphism of ''E'' with the tangent bundle of ''M''.

Often one speaks of a ''solder form on a vector bundle'', where it is understood ''a priori'' that the distinguished section of the soldering is the zero section of the bundle.  In this case, the structure group of the vector bundle is often implicitly enlarged by the [[semidirect product]] of ''GL''(''n'') with the typical fibre of ''E'' (which is a representation of ''GL''(''n'')).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kobayashi (1957) section 11 for a discussion of the companion reduction of the structure group.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
* As a special case, for instance, the tangent bundle itself carries a canonical solder form, namely the identity.
* If ''M'' has a [[Riemannian metric]] (or [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]]), then the [[covariant metric tensor]] gives an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;g\colon TM \to T^*M&lt;/math&gt; from the tangent bundle to the [[cotangent bundle]], which is a solder form.
* In [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], the solder form is known as the [[tautological one-form]], or alternately as the '''Liouville one-form''', the '''Poincaré one-form''', the '''canonical one-form''', or the '''symplectic potential'''.

====Applications====
A solder form on a vector bundle allows one to define the [[torsion tensor|torsion]] and [[contorsion tensor]]s of a [[connection (vector bundle)|connection]].

===Principal bundles===
In the language of principal bundles, a '''solder form''' on a smooth [[principal bundle|principal ''G''-bundle]] ''P'' over a [[smooth manifold]] ''M'' is a horizontal and ''G''-equivariant [[vector-valued differential form|differential 1-form]] on ''P'' with values in a [[linear representation]] ''V'' of ''G'' such that the associated [[bundle map]] from the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'' to the [[associated bundle]] ''P''&amp;times;&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt; ''V'' is a [[bundle map|bundle isomorphism]]. (In particular, ''V'' and ''M'' must have the same dimension.)

A motivating example of a solder form is the [[frame bundle#Solder form|tautological or fundamental form]] on the [[frame bundle]] of a manifold.

The reason for the name is that a solder form solders (or attaches) the abstract principal bundle to the manifold ''M'' by identifying an associated bundle with the tangent bundle. Solder forms provide a method for studying [[G-structure|''G''-structures]] and are important in the theory of [[Cartan connection]]s. The terminology and approach is particularly popular in the physics literature.

'''Spoons''' can be played as a makeshift [[percussion instrument]], or more specifically, an [[idiophone]] related to the [[castanets]]. They are played by hitting one spoon against the other.

== Techniques ==
# Fire [[tongs]] style : A pair of spoons is held tight with concave sides facing out and with index finger between their handles to space them apart. When the pair is struck, the spoons sharply hit each other and then spring back to their original position. The spoons are typically struck against the knee and the palm of the hand. The fingers and other body parts may also be used as striking surfaces to produce different sounds, rhythms, rattles and visual effects. 
# Salad serving style: one spoon between little, ring, and long finger; the other spoon between ring, thumb, and index finger in such a way that they can be rotated with ring finger as the common axis. They can be hit to each other at the convex sides by gathering the fingers (mostly middle and thumb).
# [[Castanets]] style, two in each hand one spoon held concave-side against the palm held down by the thumb, one between ring and middle fingers with finger tips in the concave side balancing the handle. They can be hit to each other at the convex sides by gripping with the middle and ring fingers.
# One spoon held concave-side against the palm, and handle jammed tight under the [[wrist watch]] belt, another in between ring and middle fingers of the left hand hitting the latter castanet style, and a third spoon in the right hand hitting both spoons in the left hand, [[drum stick]] style.

== American folk music ==
In the United States spoons as instrument are associated with [[American folk music]], [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]], and [[jugband|jug and spasm bands]]. These musical genres make use of other everyday objects as instruments, such as the [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]] and the [[Jug (musical instrument)|jug]]. In addition to common tableware, spoons that are joined at the handle are available from musical instrument suppliers.

==British folk music==
As percussion, spoons accompany [[fiddle]] playing and other folk sets. An example is seen in ''[[Midsomer Murders]]'' Series 6, episode 2, where Detective Sergeant Gavin Troy plays the spoons at a house party joining a fiddle player who is entertaining the guests. He uses the first technique. The guests also contribute percussion by hand clapping in time with the music.

The song "[[This Old Man]]" refers to a related concept, except with [[Bones (instrument)|sheep bones]] (hence [[paddywhack]]) instead of spoons.

==Canadian folk music==
In Canada, the spoons accompany fiddle playing in Québecois and Acadian music. Also, Newfoundland and the Atlantic Provinces popularly play the spoons at family gatherings. Playing the spoons is rarely seen in Western Canada.

==Greek folk music==
The spoons in [[Greece]], as a percussion instrument are known as ''koutalakia'' ({{lang-el|κουταλάκια}}), which means also, spoon. The dancers hold the wooden koutalakia, to accompany with a variety of knocks their dance rhythms. The most of them, are very beautifully sculpted or painted.

== Russian folk music ==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:WoodSpoon.jpg|thumb|250px|Russian Wooden Spoon {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
Spoons are often used in [[ethnic Russian music]] and are known as ''lozhki'' ({{lang-ru|Ло́жки}} ''[plural]''; ''Pronunciation'': {{Audio|Ru-ложка.ogg|Ложка}} ''[singular]''). The use of ''spoons'' for music dating at least from the 18th century (and probably older).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.folkmusic.ru/logka.php| title= Wooden Spoons|publisher= FolkMusic.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, three or more wooden spoons are used. The convex surfaces of the bowls are struck together in different ways. For example, two spoons are held by their handles in the left hand, and the third, held in the right hand, is used to hit the two spoons in the left hand. The hit, in a sliding motion, produces a typical sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://slavyane.nnov.ru/index.phtml?lng=ru&amp;id=44|title= Russian Folk Instruments -&gt; Lozhki|publisher= Slavyane.Nnov.ru|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090716014626/http://slavyane.nnov.ru/index.phtml?lng=ru&amp;id=44|archivedate= 2009-07-16|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://slavyane.nnov.ru/index.phtml?lng=ru&amp;id=95|title= Russian Folk Instruments -&gt; Lozhki (maple)|publisher= Slavyane.Nnov.ru|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090716014630/http://slavyane.nnov.ru/index.phtml?lng=ru&amp;id=95|archivedate= 2009-07-16|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One can also hold three spoons in the left hand and put a fourth into the bot or the pocket. A fifth spoon is then held in the right hand and used to hit the other four. Finally, one can hold the bowl of a single spoon in the left hand and hit it with another spoon. In this style, different sounds can be emitted by holding the bowl more or less tightly.

These wooden spoons are commonly used in performances of Russian folk music and sometimes even in Russian orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://folkinst.narod.ru/lozki.html| title=Ложки |publisher=Folkinst@narod.ru }}&lt;/ref&gt; A video of a choir performing a Russian folk song with spoon and [[balalaika]] accompaniment can be found below.

==Turkish folk music==
[[Image:Satz Holzloeffeltanz-Kasiklar.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Dursunbey Barana ekibi.jpg|thumb|[[Balıkesir]] [[zeybek dance]]]]

Kaşık (spoon) is a Turkish and [[Uzbekistan]] percussion instrument. The ones made from [[Buxus|boxwood]] are particularly favoured. There are also different holding styles.
# The handle of one is taken between the long finger and ring finger, fingertips into the concave part, The Concave part of the second spoon is leaned against the base of the thumb in a back to back position with the first spoon. This is the most popular method used mostly with two spoons in each hand, hands up, dancing. Closing the fist clashes the pairs of spoons to each other. Sometimes the tips of the spoon handles in either hand are brushed against each other to get a different sound.
# The handle of one spoon is held by the ring finger, thumb, and pointing finger, the handle of the other spoon is placed behind the ring finger, but on the inside of the little finger and the long finger in a back to back position with the first spoon. The ring finger works like a hinge and helps to hold both spoons. clasping the fingers lightly causes the spoons to hit each other. This holding style is essentially the same as holding salad spoons for single hand serving; except for this purpose the spoons should not be back to back.
# The two spoons are held back to back on either side of the right hands index finger, the tips of the spoon handles are held lightly with the little and ring figers the spoons are then hit down to the leg, up to the inside of the left hand, left thumb and index finger hold lightly and let both handles slip through to get several spoon sounds in one up down movement,  spoon tips are allowed to skip over several left hand fingers or folds of the left sleeve to get a repetitive roll. This is the most popular method when sitting.
# The left hand holds spoons as in the first style, a third spoon is pushed under the strap of the watch, and the right hand holds the fourth spoon. This is used when sitting.

'''Symbiogenesis''', or '''endosymbiotic theory''', is an evolutionary theory of the origin of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic cells]] from [[prokaryote|prokaryotic organisms]], first articulated in 1905 and 1910 by the [[Russians|Russian]] botanist [[Konstantin Mereschkowski]], and advanced and substantiated with microbiological evidence by [[Lynn Margulis]] in 1967. It holds that the [[organelle]]s distinguishing eukaryote cells evolved through [[symbiosis]] of individual single-celled prokaryotes ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]).

The theory holds that [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], [[plastid]]s such as [[chloroplast]]s, and possibly other organelles of eukaryotic cells represent formerly free-living prokaryotes taken one inside the other in [[endosymbiont|endosymbiosis]]. In more detail, mitochondria appear to be related to [[Rickettsiales]] [[proteobacteria]], and chloroplasts to nitrogen-fixing filamentous [[cyanobacteria]].

Among the many lines of evidence supporting symbiogenesis are that new mitochondria and plastids are formed only through [[binary fission]], and that cells cannot create new ones otherwise; that the [[transport protein]]s called [[porin (protein)|porins]] are found in the outer membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacterial cell membranes; that [[cardiolipin]] is found only in the inner mitochondrial membrane and bacterial cell membranes; and that some mitochondria and plastids contain single circular DNA molecules similar to the chromosomes of bacteria.

The theory of symbiogenesis (from [[Ancient Greek |Greek]]: σύν ''syn'' "together", βίος ''bios'' "life", and γένεσις ''genesis'' "origin, birth") was first outlined by the [[Russians|Russian]] botanist [[Konstantin Mereschkowski]] in his 1905 work, ''The nature and origins of chromatophores in the plant kingdom'', and then elaborated in his 1910 ''The Theory of Two Plasms as the Basis of Symbiogenesis, a New Study of the Origins of Organisms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mereschkowski, K. |authorlink=Konstantin Mereschkowski |title=Über Natur und Ursprung der Chromatophoren im Pflanzenreiche |trans-title=On the nature and origin of chromatophores in the plant kingdom |journal=Biologisches Centralblatt  |date=15 September 1905 |volume=25 |issue=18 |pages=593–604 |language=German |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31822009245838;view=1up;seq=603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

(Meanwhile, Prof. Schmitz reported to me that among algae, the creation of chlorophyll granules from the cell plasma doesn't occur, but that they arise exclusively from one another by division. The spores receive from the mother plant chlorophyll granules, which create, by division, all of the chlorophyll granules of the plants that arises from them [i.e., the spores]. This finding in algae made it seem likely to Prof. Schmitz that the higher plants would behave likewise.) From p. 106: ''"Meine Untersuchungen haben ergeben, … aus dem Scheitelmeristem sich entwickelnden Gewebe erzeugen."'' (My investigations have revealed that the vegetation points [i.e., points of vegetative growth] always contain differentiated chlorophyll bodies or their colorless rudiments; that they arise not by creation from the cell plasma, but from one another by division, and that they create all chlorophyll bodies and starch-forming [bodies] of the tissues developing from the apical meristem.) From p. 112, footnote 2: ''"Sollte es sich definitiv bestätigen, … an eine Symbiose erinnern."'' (If it should definitely be confirmed that the plastids in egg cells are not formed anew, then their relation to the organism containing them would somewhat suggest a symbiosis.)

The theory was advanced and substantiated with microbiological evidence by [[Lynn Margulis]] in a 1967 paper, ''On the origin of mitosing cells.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sagan, Lynn |authorlink=Lynn Margulis |year=1967 |title=On the origin of mitosing cells |journal=[[J Theor Biol]] |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=255–274 |pmid=11541392 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(67)90079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1981 work ''Symbiosis in Cell Evolution'' she argued that eukaryotic cells originated as communities of interacting entities, including endosymbiotic [[spirochaete]]s that developed into eukaryotic [[flagellum |flagella]] and [[cilium |cilia]]. This last idea has not received much acceptance, because flagella lack DNA and do not show ultrastructural similarities to [[bacteria]] or [[archaea]] (see also: [[Evolution of flagella]] and [[Prokaryotic cytoskeleton]]). According to Margulis and [[Dorion Sagan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Margulis, Lynn |authorlink=Lynn Margulis |author2=Sagan, Dorion |author2link=Dorion Sagan |title=Marvellous microbes |journal=Resurgence |year=2001 |volume=206 |pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Life did not take over the globe by combat, but by networking" (i.e., by cooperation). The possibility that [[peroxisome]]s may have an endosymbiotic origin has also been considered, although they lack DNA. [[Christian de Duve]] proposed that they may have been the first endosymbionts, allowing cells to withstand growing amounts of free molecular oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere. However, it now appears that peroxisomes may be formed ''[[De novo synthesis |de novo]]'', contradicting the idea that they have a symbiotic origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Gabaldón, T.; Snel, B.; van Zimmeren, F.; Hemrika, W.; Tabak, H.; Huynen, M.A. |title=Origin and evolution of the peroxisomal proteome |journal=Biol.

Comparisons with their closest free living cyanobacteria of the genus ''[[Synechococcus]]'' (having a genome size 3 Mb, with 3300 genes) revealed that chromatophores underwent a drastic genome shrinkage. Chromatophores contained genes that were accountable for [[photosynthesis]] but were deficient in genes that could carry out other biosynthetic functions; this observation suggests that these endosymbiotic cells are highly dependent on their hosts for their survival and growth mechanisms. Thus, these chromatophores were found to be non-functional for organelle-specific purposes when compared to mitochondria and plastids. This distinction could have promoted the early [[evolution]] of photosynthetic organelles.

The loss of genetic autonomy, that is, the loss of many genes from endosymbionts, occurred very early in evolutionary time.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Why are plastid genomes retained in non-photosynthetic organisms? |url=http://www.cell.com/article/S136013850500302X/abstract|journal=Trends in Plant Science |date=2006 |pmid=16406301 |pages=101–108 |volume=11|issue=2 |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2005.12.004 |first=Adrian C.|last=Barbrook |first2=Christopher J. |last2=Howe |first3=Saul |last3=Purton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account the entire original endosymbiont genome, there are three main possible fates for genes over evolutionary time.

The mechanisms of gene transfer are not fully known; however, multiple hypotheses exist to explain this phenomenon. The [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] hypothesis involves the use of [[messenger RNA]] (mRNAs) to transport genes from organelles to the nucleus where they are converted to cDNA and incorporated into the genome.&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leister2005"/&gt; The cDNA hypothesis is based on studies of the genomes of flowering plants. Protein coding RNAs in mitochondria are spliced and edited using organelle-specific splice and editing sites. Nuclear copies of some mitochondrial genes, however, do not contain organelle-specific splice sites, suggesting a processed mRNA intermediate. The cDNA hypothesis has since been revised as edited mitochondrial cDNAs are unlikely to recombine with the nuclear genome and are more likely to recombine with their native mitochondrial genome. If the edited mitochondrial sequence recombines with the mitochondrial genome, mitochondrial splice sites would no longer exist in the mitochondrial genome. Any subsequent nuclear gene transfer would therefore also lack mitochondrial splice sites.&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;

The bulk flow hypothesis is the alternative to the cDNA hypothesis, stating that escaped DNA, rather than mRNA, is the mechanism of gene transfer.&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leister2005"/&gt; According to this hypothesis, disturbances to organelles, including [[autophagy]] (normal cell destruction), [[gametogenesis]] (the formation of gametes), and cell stress, release DNA which is imported into the nucleus and incorporated into the nuclear DNA using [[non-homologous end joining]] (repair of double stranded breaks).&lt;ref name="Leister2005"/&gt; For example, in the initial stages of endosymbiosis, due to a lack of major gene transfer, the host cell had little to no control over the endosymbiont. The endosymbiont underwent cell division independently of the host cell, resulting in many "copies" of the endosymbiont within the host cell. Some of the endosymbionts [[lysis|lysed]] (burst), and high levels of DNA were incorporated into the nucleus. A similar mechanism is thought to occur in tobacco plants, which show a high rate of gene transfer and whose cells contain multiple chloroplasts.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; In addition, the bulk flow hypothesis is also supported by the presence of non-random clusters of organelle genes, suggesting the simultaneous movement of multiple genes.&lt;ref name="Leister2005"/&gt;

==Organellar genomes==

===Plastomes and mitogenomes===
[[File:Map of the human mitochondrial genome.svg|thumb|The [[Human mitochondrial genetics|human mitochondrial genome]] has retained genes encoding 2 [[rRNA]]s, 22 [[tRNA]]s, and 13 redox [[protein]]s.]]

The third and final possible fate of endosymbiont genes is that they remain in the organelles. Plastids and mitochondria, although they have lost much of their genomes, retain genes encoding rRNAs, tRNAs, proteins involved in redox reactions, and proteins required for transcription, translation, and replication.&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LilaKoumandou2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; There are many hypotheses to explain why organelles retain a small portion of their genome; however no one hypothesis will apply to all organisms&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; and the topic is still quite controversial.&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt; The hydrophobicity hypothesis states that highly [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] (water hating) proteins (such as the membrane bound proteins involved in [[redox]] reactions) are not easily transported through the cytosol and therefore these proteins must be encoded in their respective organelles.&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; The code disparity hypothesis states that the limit on transfer is due to differing genetic codes and RNA editing between the organelle and the nucleus.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; The redox control hypothesis states that genes encoding redox reaction proteins are retained in order to effectively couple the need for repair and the synthesis of these proteins.&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LilaKoumandou2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; For example, if one of the [[photosystem]]s is lost from the plastid, the intermediate electron carriers may lose or gain too many electrons, signalling the need for repair of a photosystem.&lt;ref name="LilaKoumandou2004"/&gt; The time delay involved in signalling the nucleus and transporting a cytosolic protein to the organelle results in the production of damaging [[reactive oxygen species]].&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LilaKoumandou2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; The final hypothesis states that the assembly of membrane proteins, particularly those involved in redox reactions, requires coordinated synthesis and assembly of subunits; however, translation and protein transport coordination is more difficult to control in the cytoplasm.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt;

===Non-photosynthetic plastid genomes===
The majority of the genes in the mitochondria and plastids are related to the expression (transcription, translation and replication) of genes encoding proteins involved in either photosynthesis (in plastids) or cellular respiration (in mitochondria).&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LilaKoumandou2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; One might predict that the loss of photosynthesis or cellular respiration would allow for the complete loss of the plastid genome or the mitochondrial genome respectively.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; While there are numerous examples of mitochondrial descendants ([[mitosome]]s and [[hydrogenosome]]s) that have lost their entire organellar genome,&lt;ref name="Howe2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Howe  |first=Christopher J. |title=Cellular Evolution: What's in a Mitochondrion? |url=http://www.cell.com/article/S0960982208004417/abstract |journal=Current Biology |pmid=18492476 |pages=R429-R431 |volume=18 |issue=10 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.04.007 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; non-photosynthetic plastids tend to retain a small genome.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; There are two main hypotheses to explain this occurrence:

The essential tRNA hypothesis notes that there have been no documented functional plastid-to-nucleus gene transfers of genes encoding RNA products (tRNAs and rRNAs). As a result, plastids must make their own functional RNAs or import nuclear counterparts. The genes encoding tRNA-Glu and tRNA-fmet, however, appear to be indispensable. The plastid is responsible for [[heme|haem]] biosynthesis, which requires plastid encoded tRNA-Glu (from the gene trnE) as a precursor molecule. Like other genes encoding RNAs, trnE cannot be transferred to the nucleus. In addition, it is unlikely trnE could be replaced by a cytosolic tRNA-Glu as trnE is highly conserved; single base changes in trnE have resulted in the loss of haem synthesis. The gene for tRNA-[[N-Formylmethionine|formylmethionine]] (tRNA-fmet) is also encoded in the plastid genome and is required for translation initiation in both plastids and mitochondria. A plastid is required to continue expressing the gene for tRNA-fmet so long as the mitochondrion is translating proteins.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt;

The limited window hypothesis offers a more general explanation for the retention of genes in non-photosynthetic plastids.&lt;ref name="Lane2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lane |first=Nick |title=Plastids, Genomes, and the Probability of Gene Transfer|url=http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/372 |journal=Genome Biology and Evolution |date=2011 |pmc=3101016 |pmid=21292628 |pages=372–374|volume=3|doi=10.1093/gbe/evr003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the bulk flow hypothesis, genes are transferred to the nucleus following the disturbance of organelles.&lt;ref name="Leister2005"/&gt; Disturbance was common in the early stages of endosymbiosis, however, once the host cell gained control of organelle division, eukaryotes could evolve to have only one plastid per cell. Having only one plastid severely limits gene transfer&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; as the lysis of the single plastid would likely result in cell death.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lane2011"/&gt; Consistent with this hypothesis, organisms with multiple plastids show an 80-fold increase in plastid-to-nucleus gene transfer compared to organisms with single plastids.&lt;ref name="Lane2011"/&gt;

==Secondary endosymbiosis==
Primary endosymbiosis involves the engulfment of a cell by another free living organism. Secondary endosymbiosis occurs when the product of primary endosymbiosis is itself engulfed and retained by another free living eukaryote. Secondary endosymbiosis has occurred several times and has given rise to extremely diverse groups of algae and other eukaryotes. Some organisms can take opportunistic advantage of a similar process, where they engulf an alga and use the products of its photosynthesis, but once the prey item dies (or is lost) the host returns to a free living state. Obligate secondary endosymbionts become dependent on their organelles and are unable to survive in their absence (for a review see McFadden 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McFadden, G. I. |title=Primary and secondary endosymbiosis and the origin of plastids |journal=J Phycol |year=2001 |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=951–9 |doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2001.01126.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[RedToL]], the Red Algal Tree of Life Initiative funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] highlights the role [[red algae]] or [[Rhodophyta]] played in the evolution of our planet through secondary endosymbiosis.

One possible secondary endosymbiosis in process has been observed by Okamoto &amp; Inouye (2005). The heterotrophic protist ''[[Hatena arenicola|Hatena]]'' behaves like a predator until it ingests a [[green alga]], which loses its flagella and cytoskeleton, while ''Hatena'', now a host, switches to photosynthetic nutrition, gains the ability to move towards light and loses its feeding apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Okamoto |first1=Noriko |last2=Inouye |first2=Isao |title=A Secondary Symbiosis in Progress? |journal=Science |date=2005 |volume=310 |issue=5746 |page=287 |doi=10.1126/science.1116125 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Noriko_Okamoto2/publication/7542363_A_secondary_symbiosis_in_progress/links/09e4150b3f3ec0238d000000.pdf |accessdate=15 February 2015 |pmid=16224014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of secondary endosymbiosis left its evolutionary signature within the unique topography of plastid membranes. Secondary plastids are surrounded by three (in [[euglenophyte]]s and some [[dinoflagellate]]s) or four membranes (in [[haptophyte]]s, [[heterokont]]s, [[Cryptomonad|cryptophytes]], and [[chlorarachniophyte]]s). The two additional membranes are thought to correspond to the plasma membrane of the engulfed alga and the phagosomal membrane of the host cell. The endosymbiotic acquisition of a eukaryote cell is represented in the cryptophytes; where the remnant nucleus of the red algal symbiont (the [[nucleomorph]]) is present between the two inner and two outer plastid membranes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Some species including ''[[Pediculus humanus]]'' (lice) have multiple chromosomes in the mitochondrion. This and the phylogenetics of the genes encoded within the mitochondrion suggest that mitochondria have multiple ancestors, that these were acquired by endosymbiosis on several occasions rather than just once, and that there have been extensive mergers and rearrangements of genes on the several original mitochondrial chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Georgiades, K. |author2=Raoult, D. |year=2011|title=The rhizome of ''Reclinomonas americana'', ''Homo sapiens'', ''Pediculus humanus'' and ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' mitochondria|url=http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/55|journal=Biology Direct|volume=6|page=55|doi=10.1186/1745-6150-6-55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Date ==
The question of when the transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic form occurred and when the first crown-group eukaryotes appeared on earth is still unresolved. The oldest known body fossils that can be positively assigned to the Eukaryota are acanthomorphic [[acritarch]]s from the 1631±1 Ma Deonar Formation of India (lower Vindhyan Supergroup) of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Prasad |first=Pijai |date=August 2005 |title=Organic-walled microfossils from the Proterozoic Vindhyan Supergroup of Son Valley, Madhya Pradesh, India |url=http://14.139.63.228:8080/pbrep/bitstream/123456789/1084/1/PbV54_13.pdf |journal=Paleobotanist |volume=54 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These fossils can still be identiﬁed as derived post-nuclear eukaryotes with a sophisticated, morphology-generating [[cytoskeleton]] sustained by mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Butterfield |first=Nicholas J. |date=2014-11-26 |title=Early evolution of the Eukaryota |url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/pala.12139 |journal=Palaeontology |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=5–17 |doi=10.1111/pala.12139}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fossil evidence indicates that endosymbiotic acquisition of [[alphaproteobacteria]] must have occurred before 1.6 Ga.

A '''time crystal''' or '''space-time crystal''' is a structure that repeats in [[time]], as well as in [[space]]. Normal three-dimensional  [[crystal]]s have a repeating pattern in space, but remain unchanged as time passes. Time crystals repeat themselves in time as well, leading the crystal to change from moment to moment. A time crystal never reaches [[thermal equilibrium]], as it is a type of non-equilibrium matter, a form of matter proposed in 2012, and first observed in 2017. This state of matter cannot be isolated from its environment{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}—it is an open system in [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|non-equilibrium]].

The idea of a time crystal was first described by [[Nobel laureate]] and [[MIT]] professor [[Frank Wilczek]] in 2012. Later work developed a more precise definition for time crystals. It was proven that they cannot exist in equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Watanabe|Oshikawa|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2014 Krzysztof Sacha at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krakow]] predicted the behaviour of discrete time crystals in a periodically-driven many-body system.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Sacha|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Norman Yao et al. at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] proposed a different way to create time crystals in spin systems. From there, [[Christopher Monroe]] and [[Mikhail Lukin]] independently confirmed this in their labs. Both experiments were published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] in 2017.

==History==
[[File:Frank Wilczek.jpg|thumb|[[Nobel laureate]] [[Frank Wilczek]] at [[University of Paris-Saclay]]]]
The idea of a space-time crystal was first put forward by [[Frank Wilczek]], a professor at [[MIT]] and [[Nobel laureate]], in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Wilczek|2012}} and {{harvp|Shapere|Wilczek|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Xiang Zhang, a nanoengineer at [[University of California, Berkeley]], and his team proposed creating a time crystal in the form of a constantly rotating ring of charged ions.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvs|txt|last1=Li et al.|year1=2012a|year2=2012b}}, Wolchover 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Wilczek and Zhang, Patrick Bruno, a theorist at the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] in [[Grenoble]], France, published several papers in 2013 claiming to show that space-time crystals were impossible. Also later Masaki Oshikawa from the University of Tokyo showed that time crystals would be impossible at their ground state; moreover, he implied that any matter cannot exist in non-equilibrium in its ground state.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Bruno|2013a}} and {{harvp|Bruno|2013b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Thomas|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent work developed more precise definitions of [[time translation symmetry]]-breaking which ultimately led to a [[No-go theorem|'no-go' proof]] that quantum time crystals in equilibrium are not possible.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Nozières|2013}}, {{harvp|Yao et al.|2017|p=1}} and {{harvp|Volovik|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Watanabe|Oshikawa|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several realizations of time crystals, which avoid the equilibrium no-go arguments, were later proposed.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Wilczek|2013b}} and {{harvp|Yoshii et al.|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krzysztof Sacha at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krakow]] predicted the behaviour of discrete time crystals in a periodically driven system of ultracold atoms.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Sacha|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later works&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Khemani et al.|2016}} and {{harvp|Else et al.|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested periodically driven quantum spin systems could show similar behaviour.

Norman Yao at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] studied a different model of time crystals.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Yao et al.|2017}}, {{Harvp|Richerme|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His blueprint was successfully used by two teams: a group led by [[Harvard university|Harvard]]'s [[Mikhail Lukin]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;See {{harvp|Choi et al.|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a group led by [[Christopher Monroe]] at [[University of Maryland]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;See {{harvp|Zhang et al.|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time translation symmetry==
{{main article|Time translation symmetry}}
Symmetries in nature lead directly to conservation laws, something which is precisely formulated by the [[Noether theorem]].{{sfn|Cao|2004|p=151}}

The basic idea of ''time-translation symmetry'' is that a translation in time has no effect on physical laws, i.e. that the laws of nature that apply today were the same in the past and will be the same in the future.{{sfn|Wilczek|2015|loc=chpt. 3}} This symmetry implies the [[conservation of energy]].{{sfn|Feng|Jin|2005|p=18}}

===Broken symmetry in normal crystals===
{{main article|Crystal symmetry|spontaneous symmetry breaking}}
[[Image:Phonon nu process.svg|thumb|right|250px|Figure 2. Normal process (N-process) and Umklapp process (U-process). While the N-process conserves total [[phonon]] momentum, the U-process changes phonon momentum.]] Normal crystals exhibit ''broken translation symmetry'':  they have repeated patterns in space, and are not invariant under arbitrary translations or rotations. The laws of physics are unchanged by arbitrary translations and rotations. However, if we hold fixed the atoms of a crystal, the dynamics of electrons or other particles in the crystal depends on how it moves relative to the crystal, and particles' momentum can change by interacting with the atoms of a crystal — for example in [[Umklapp process]]es.{{sfn|Sólyom|2007|p=193}} [[Quasimomentum]], however, is conserved in a perfect crystal.{{sfn|Sólyom|2007|p=191}}

===Broken symmetry in time crystals===
Time crystals seem to break ''time-translation symmetry,'' and have repeated patterns in time. Fields or particles may change their energy by interacting with a time crystal, just as they can change their momentum by interacting with a spatial crystal.

==Thermodynamics==
Time crystals do not violate the laws of thermodynamics: energy in the overall system is conserved, such a crystal does not spontaneously convert thermal energy into mechanical work, and it cannot serve as a perpetual store of work.  But it may change perpetually in a fixed pattern in time for as long as the system can be maintained. They possess "motion without energy"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/time-crystals-might-exist-after-all-and-they-could-break-the-symmetry-of-space-and-time|title=Time Crystals Might Exist After All - And They Could Break Space-Time Symmetry|last=Crew|first=Bec|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;—their apparent motion does not represent conventional kinetic energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-crystals-could-be-legitimate-form-perpetual-motion/|title="Time Crystals" Could Be a Legitimate Form of Perpetual Motion - Scie…|date=2017-02-02|work=archive.is|access-date=2017-09-21|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20170202101455/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-crystals-could-be-legitimate-form-perpetual-motion/|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proven that a time crystal cannot exist in thermal equilibrium.  Recent years have seen more studies of non-equilibrium quantum fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Esposito et al.|2009}} and {{harvp|Campisi et al.|2011}} for academic review articles on non-equilibrium quantum fluctuations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==
In October 2016, Christopher Monroe at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] claimed to have created the world's first discrete time crystal. Using the idea from Yao's proposal, his team trapped a chain of [[Ytterbium-171|&lt;sup&gt;171&lt;/sup&gt;Yb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ([[ytterbium]]) ions in a [[Paul trap]], confined by radio frequency electromagnetic fields. One of the two [[Spin quantum number|spin states]] was selected by a pair of laser beams. The lasers were pulsed, with the shape of the pulse controlled by an [[acousto-optic modulator]], using the [[Tukey window]] to avoid too much energy at the wrong optical frequency. The [[hyperfine]] electron states in that setup, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; |F=0, m&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0⟩ and |F = 1, m&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0⟩, have very close energy levels, separated by 12.642831&amp;nbsp;GHz. Ten [[Doppler cooling|Doppler-cooled]] ions were placed in a line 0.025&amp;nbsp;mm long and coupled together.

The researchers observed a subharmonic oscillation of the drive. The experiment showed "rigidity" of the time crystal, where the oscillation frequency remained unchanged even when the time crystal was perturbed, and that it gained a frequency of its own and vibrated according to it (rather than only the frequency of the drive). However, once the perturbation or frequency of vibration grew too strong, the time crystal "melted" and lost this subharmonic oscillation, and it returned to the same state as before where it moved only with the induced frequency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Later in 2016, [[Mikhail Lukin]] at Harvard also reported the creation of a driven time crystal. His group used a [[diamond]] crystal doped with a high concentration of [[nitrogen-vacancy center]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, which have strong dipole-dipole coupling and relatively long-lived spin [[Coherence (physics)#Quantum coherence|coherence]]. This strongly-interacting dipolar spin system was driven with microwave fields, and the ensemble spin state with an optical (laser) field was determine. It was observed that the spin polarization evolved at half the frequency of the microwave drive. The oscillations persisted for over 100 cycles. This [[Subharmonic function|subharmonic]] response to the drive frequency is seen as a signature of time-crystalline order.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2099">In [[category theory]], a discipline in [[mathematics]], the notion of '''topological category''' has a number of different, inequivalent definitions.

In one approach, a topological category is a category that is [[enriched category|enriched]] over the category of [[compactly generated space|compactly generated]] [[Hausdorff space]]s. They can be used as a foundation for [[higher category theory]], where they can play the role of (∞,1)-categories. An important example of a topological category in this sense is given by the category of [[CW complex]]es, where each set Hom(''X'',''Y'') of continuous maps from ''X'' to ''Y'' is equipped with the [[compact-open topology]]. {{harv|Lurie|2009}}

In another approach, a topological category is defined as a category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; along with a [[forgetful functor]] &lt;math&gt;T: C \to \mathbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; that maps to the [[category of sets]] and has the following three properties:
* &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; admits initial (or weak) structures with respect to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;
* Constant functions in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; lift to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;-[[morphism]]s
* Fibers &lt;math&gt;T^{-1} x, x \in \mathbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; are small (they are sets and not [[proper class]]es).
An example of a topological category in this sense is the categories of all [[topological space]]s with continuous maps, where one uses the standard forgetful functor.&lt;ref name="Brümmer1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brümmer|first=G. C. L.|title=Topological categories|journal=Topology and its Applications|date=September 1984|volume=18|issue=1|pages=27–41|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166864184900294|accessdate=1 October 2013|doi=10.1016/0166-8641(84)90029-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trans bashing''' is the act of [[victimizing]] a person emotionally, physically, sexually, or verbally because they are [[transgender]] or [[Transsexualism|transsexual]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20774504-5005961,00.html Guilty plea over transsexual bashing] By Mariza O'Keefe in ''Herald Sun''&lt;/ref&gt;  The term has also been applied to [[hate speech]] directed at transgender people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2007/4-27/view/columns/10484.cfm|title=Page not found - Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights|website=Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at depictions of transgender people in the media that reinforce negative stereotypes about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary|last=McNamara|title=Transgender Artists, Work Gaining Acceptance|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2001-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrimination, including physical or sexual violence against trans people due to [[transphobia]] or [[homophobia]], is a common occurrence for trans people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040612144850/http://www.opha.on.ca/ppres/2003-06_pp.pdf|title=2003-06_pp.pdf|website=docs.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, D.B.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hate crimes against trans people are common even recently, and "in some instances, inaction by police or other government officials leads to the untimely deaths of transgender victims."&lt;ref name="cider"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frye|first=Phyllis|date=Fall 2000|title=The International Bill of Gender Rights vs. The Cide House Rules: Transgenders struggle with the courts over what clothing they are allowed to wear on the job, which restroom they are allowed to use on the job, their right to marry, and the very definition of their sex|journal=William and Mary Journal of Women and the Law|volume=7|pages=139–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most infamous incidents was the December 1993 rape and murder of [[Brandon Teena]], a young [[trans man]], by two male friends after they found out that he had been assigned female at birth.&lt;ref name="trutv5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/not_guilty/brandon/5.html|title=Teena Brandon|last=Ramsland|first=Katherine|publisher=[[TruTV]]|pages=5|accessdate=2009-02-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214094602/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/not_guilty/brandon/5.html|archivedate=2013-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events became internationally known when told in the feature film ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'', which earned [[Hilary Swank]] an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

== Differentiation from gay bashing ==

Unlike [[gay bashing]], trans bashing is committed because of the target's actual or perceived [[gender identity]], not [[sexual orientation]].{{Dubious |Not about gender identity |reason=No, it's because of their transgressive gender expression, irrespective of a cis or trans identity |date=December 2017}}  However, a trans person may be gay bashed if the person perceives them as gay rather than transgender.{{cn |date=December 2017}}

At least since the [[Stonewall riots]] in 1969, people from the greater trans communities have often been politically aligned with the lesbian, gay, and bisexual communities.&lt;ref&gt;Kay Dayus, Transgenders Protest HRC Exec's Visit to Houston, Hous. Voice, Sept. 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  However, researchers and some activists from the greater trans communities argue trans bashing should be categorized separately from violence committed on the basis of sexual orientation ("gay-bashing").&lt;ref name="cider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discrimination and Hate Crimes Against Gender Variant People, It's Time Illinois . . . Political Action for the Gender Variant Community (May 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-trans bias crimes have been conceptually and characteristically distinguished from homophobic crimes in the scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Transgender Hate Crimes: The Challenge for Law Enforcement, at http://jointheimpactma.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Victimization-Study-Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One argument is that conflating violence against trans peoples with violence against gay people erases the identities of people in the greater trans communities and the truth of what happens to them.  However, campaigns against gay bashing and trans bashing are often seen as a common cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workers.org/ww/1998/bashing1008.php|title=Workers World Oct. 8, 1998: Zero tolerance for gay-trans bashing|website=www.workers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one case, perpetrators accused of hate crimes against trans people have tried to use a [[trans panic]] defense, an extension of [[gay panic defense]].&lt;ref name="TRTH"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SiaNoJ3puyQC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22gwen+araujo%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA47,M1 ''Transpeople: Repudiation, Trauma, Healing''] by Christopher A. Shelley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TMCIAC"&gt;[http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=153 "Two murder convictions in Araujo case"], Zak Szymanski; ''[[Bay Area Reporter]]'' 15 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The jury deadlocked, but there is evidence they rejected the trans-panic defense.  One law journal provided an analysis of the trans-panic defense, arguing in part that the emotional premise of a trans panic defense (shock at discovering unexpected genitals) is different from the emotional premise of a gay panic defense (shock at being propositioned by a member of the same sex, perhaps because of one's repressed homosexuality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steinberg|first=Victoria L.|date=Spring 2005|title=A Heat of Passion Offense: Emotions and Bias in "Trans Panic" Mitigation Claims: Hiding From Humanity|journal=Boston College Third World Law Journal|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laws covering gender identity ==

===International===
The United Nations adopted their [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948 as the first global declaration of human rights.&lt;ref name=UDHR&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr|website=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of articles in the declaration that have been suggested to specifically pertain to transgender people and violence (including, but not limited to, physical, psychological, legal, systemic, emotional, and political violence), although LGBT rights are not explicitly outlined in the document.

* Article 2 entitles individuals to all of the rights and freedoms set forth in the declaration "without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status". 
* Article 5 states that "[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."
* Article 7 states that "[a]ll are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination". 
* Article 9 bans "arbitrary arrest, detention or exile" (which, according to Article 2, is protected from distinction based on identity or belief).
* Article 20 states that "[e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."&lt;ref name="AI Human Rights"&gt;{{cite web|title=About LGBT Human Rights|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/lgbt-rights/about-lgbt-human-rights|website=amnestyusa.org|publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===

====United States====
[[File:Map of LGBT-related hate crime law in the United States.svg|thumb|right|Current U.S. LGBT [[hate crimes laws in the United States|hate crimes laws]] by state. A national hate crimes law encompasses both sexual orientation and gender identity.

{{legend|#00ffff|Sexual orientation recognized for data collection about hate crimes}}
{{legend|#cccccc|State hate crimes law uninclusive of sexual orientation or gender identity}}]]

In the United States, currently seventeen states plus the District of Columbia have hate crime laws protecting people victimized on the basis of their gender identity (they are [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Hawaii]], [[Illinois]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[Nevada]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/hate_crime_laws|title=Hate Crime Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 2000s in [[Seattle]]'s [[gay village]] of [[Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington|Capitol Hill]], there was evidence of an increase in incidents of trans bashing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectator.seattleu.edu/news/story.aspx?ID=14050|title=Gentrification ousting local gay community|last=Holt|first=Emily|publisher=The Spectator|accessdate=2 January 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502105800/http://spectator.seattleu.edu/news/story.aspx?ID=14050|archivedate=2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Matthew Shepard Act]] expanded the federal hate crime laws to include gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation. In order to qualify as a federal hate crime in the United States, the crime must include successful or attempted bodily injury due to the use of firearm, explosives, weapons, fire, or incendiary devices.&lt;ref name="18 U.S. Code § 249 (a)(2) (a) – “Hate Crime Acts”"&gt;{{cite web|title=18 U.S. Code § 249 (a)(2) (a) – "Hate Crime Acts"|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap13-sec249.pdf|website=Government Publishing Office|publisher=Government Publishing Office|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hate crimes are covered by state, rather than federal laws unless the victim or defendant travel across state lines or national borders; using an interstate commuting route; the weapon has been brought across state lines; or if the conduct interferes with or otherwise affects commerce across state lines.&lt;ref name="18 U.S. Code § 249 (a)(2) (a) – “Hate Crime Acts”" /&gt; This means that, unless hate crimes under the federal definition occur in a way that does not just affect one state, states have the freedom to implement their own hate crime laws. The protections of these laws range widely. Pennsylvania, for example, has not included gender identity in their hate crime protections since it was rescinded from the law in 2008.&lt;ref name="Philadelphia Hate Crime Laws"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giampolo|first1=Angela|title=Changing the State of Hate Crime-Laws in Philadelphia|url=http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202671537351/Changing-the-State-of-HateCrime-Laws-in-Pennsylvania?slreturn=20140923231944|accessdate=28 April 2015|agency=The Legal Intelligencer|publisher=The Legal Intelligencer|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====='Bathroom bills' to enforce gendered bathroom use=====

{{Main article|Bathroom bill}}

Bathroom bills are bills proposed with relation to bathroom access and gender identity.&lt;ref name="Bathroom bills definition"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sprigg|first1=Peter|title="Gender Identity" Protections  ("Bathroom Bills")|url=http://www.frc.org/onepagers/gender-identity-protections-bathroom-bills|website=Family Research Council|publisher=Family Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a number of [[Bathroom_bill#United_States|bills proposed in the United States]] intended to limit access to restrooms for those who do not identify with the sex on their birth certificate. Some of these bills are justified with the rationale of protecting cisgender women from violent acts committed by cisgender men entering their facilities under the pretense of identifying as transgender women, although there is no evidence thus far of any incidences of this.&lt;ref name="Florida lawmaker"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bixby|first1=Scott|title=This Lawmaker Wants to Make It Illegal for Transgender People to Use Bathrooms|url=http://mic.com/articles/110314/this-lawmaker-wants-to-make-it-illegal-for-trans-people-to-use-bathrooms|publisher=Mic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Debunking myth about bathroom bills"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maza|first1=Carlos|title=Debunking The Big Myth About Transgender-Inclusive Bathrooms|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/03/20/debunking-the-big-myth-about-transgender-inclus/198530|agency=Media Matters for America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Effects of bathroom bills"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brinker|first1=Luke|title=One Month Later: How California's Transgender Student Law Is Affecting Public Schools|url=http://equalitymatters.org/blog/201401310002|agency=Equality Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some transgender people are content, and may even prefer, using [[Unisex_public_toilet|gender-neutral bathrooms]], but others expect the right to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. The Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network found that singling out trans students by offering them alternative facility options may backfire by increasing their chances of disengaging from school or dropping out entirely.&lt;ref name="GLSEN Study trans in school"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harsh Realities: The Experiences of Transgender Youth in Our Nation|url=http://glsen.org/sites/default/files/Harsh%20Realities.pdf|website=Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network|publisher=GLSEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Harassment of transgender people in bathrooms=====

It is transgender people who are likely to be harassed in bathrooms by cisgender people, not the other way around. In one survey, 70 percent of the transgender respondents had faced discrimination when attempting to use a restroom of their gender identity, including "denial of access to facilities, verbal harassment, and physical assault."&lt;ref name="Williams Institute Study Bathroom access"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herman|first1=Jody|title=Williams Institute|url=http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf|publisher=Williams Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such harassment occurred in 2018, when [[United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_California,_2018#District_44|California Republican Congressional candidate Jazmina Saavedra]] said she heard the "voice of a man" from a locked stall in the women's restroom of a fast-food restaurant in Los Angeles and filmed herself chasing the person out of the restaurant with assistance from the restaurant manager. In the video, Saavedra said she was prepared to use pepper spray and a stungun against the transgender woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Broverman|first1=Neal|title=Trump Supporter Broadcasts Live as She Chases Trans Woman Out of Bathroom|url=https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2018/5/17/trump-supporter-broadcasts-live-she-chases-trans-woman-out-bathroom|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=The Advocate|date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of tactic can result in public [[outing]] of a transgender person's current or former gender identity.

===Europe===

====Malta====

Malta passed the 'Gender Identity, Gender Expression, and Sex Characteristics Act in 2015. This bill states that all citizens of Malta have the right to
# The recognition of their gender identity;
# The free development of their person according to their gender identity;
# Be treated according to their gender identity and, particularly, to be identified in that way in the documents providing their identity therein; and
# Bodily integrity and physical autonomy.&lt;ref name="Malta Transgender Bill" /&gt;

This act protects the gender identity of a person at all times. It also states that "person shall not be required to provide proof of a surgical procedure for total or partial genital reassignment, hormonal therapies or any other psychiatric, psychological or medical treatment to make use of the right to gender identity." The act allows parents to postpone listing gender on a child's birth certificate and prohibits “non-medically necessary treatments on the sex characteristics of a person.”&lt;ref name="Malta Transgender Bill"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act (Malta, 2015)|url=http://tgeu.org/gender-identity-gender-expression-sex-characteristics-act-malta-2015/|website=Transgender Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Explanation of Malta Gender Identity Law"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Identity, Gender Expression And Sex Characteristics Act|url=http://socialdialogue.gov.mt/en/Public_Consultations/MSDC/Pages/Consultations/GIGESC.aspx|publisher=Social Dialogue Malta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==

Media can contribute to trans bashing through misinformation and scare tactics. Transgender individuals are oftentimes misrepresented negatively in media, or not represented in media at all.Transgender individuals may be portrayed in the media as curiosities or oddities, as mentally unstable persons, and/ or as predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=108759276&amp;S=R&amp;D=a9h&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNHX8kSeqLE4v%2BbwOLCmr06ep7ZSsqa4Ta6WxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGut1C3rLZNuePfgeyx44Hy7fEA|title="DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT DECEPTION": THE NECESSARY EROSION OF THE TRANS* PANIC DEFENSE|last=Panfil|first=Vanessa|date=June 11, 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A public example of this is the attention paid to the transition of [[Chelsea Manning]], a transgender U.S. Army soldier imprisoned for releasing classified documents to [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tate|first1=Julie|title=Bradley Manning sentenced to 35 years in WikiLeaks case|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/judge-to-sentence-bradley-manning-today/2013/08/20/85bee184-09d0-11e3-b87c-476db8ac34cd_story.html|agency=Washington Post|publisher=Washington Post|date=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Fox News]] story on Manning's transition was introduced with the [[Aerosmith]] song "[[Dude (Looks Like a Lady)]]", while host [[Gretchen Carlson]] referred to Chelsea by her birth name, Bradley, mocking ''The New York Times'' for "helping him" by using Manning's preferred gender pronoun.&lt;ref name="Chelsea Manning Fox coverage"&gt;{{cite news|title='Fox &amp; Friends' Chelsea Manning Segment Introduced With Aerosmith's 'Dude (Looks Like A Lady)' (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/27/fox-and-friends-chelsea-manning-aerosmith-dude-looks-like-a-lady_n_3823650.html|website=Huffington Post | date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army refused to let her grow her hair as long as female prisoners, and continued referring to her as Bradley "to avoid confusion" until a court mandated her preferred gender pronouns.&lt;ref name="Army stop calling Chelsea Manning male"&gt;{{cite news|title=huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/05/chelsea-manning_n_6811352.html|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/05/chelsea-manning_n_6811352.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trans health==
According to the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on Health and Health Care (NTDSR), which surveyed 6,450 transgender and gender non-conforming people, people who do not identify with their birth sex face obstacles to getting healthcare and have a greater likelihood of facing health issues related to their gender identity.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harrison|first1=Jack|title=Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|website=National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|publisher=National Gay and Lesbian Task Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===

Transgender people experience greater mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, suicide attempts, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as physical health disparities (e.g., cardiovascular disease).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=c662ff9f-e9f1-4e22-ac90-f5588f42f101%2540sessionmgr107&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=115|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trans people also have a higher rate of suicide attempts than the population as a whole.&lt;ref name="Youth Suicide Prevention Program"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics about Youth Suicide|url=http://www.yspp.org/about_suicide/statistics.htm|website=Youth Suicide Prevention Program|publisher=Youth Suicide Prevention Program|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124702/http://www.yspp.org/about_suicide/statistics.htm|archivedate=2015-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, the 2.2% of U.S. adults had attempted suicide&lt;ref name="Suicide Attempt Rates US"&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicidal Thoughts and Suicide Attempts|url=http://www.sprc.org/basics/scope/attempts|website=Suicide Prevention Resource Center|publisher=Suicide Prevention Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 41% of trans people had attempted suicide in 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt; The rate of attempted suicide in transgender individuals increased to 51% for those bullied or harassed in school, 55% for those who recently lost a job due to bias, and 61% and 64% for those who were victims of physical and sexual assault, respectively.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt;
Low self-esteem in transgender people has been linked to being at high-risk for HIV transmission.&lt;ref name="Sugano et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sugano|first1=E|title=The impact of exposure to transphobia on HIV risk behavior in a sample of transgender women of color in San Francisco|journal=AIDS and Behavior|date=2006|volume=10|pages=215–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bockting et al. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bockting|first1=W|title=Transgender HIV prevention: Community involvement and empowerment|journal=Transgender and HIV: Risks, Prevention, and Care|date=2001|pages=119–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the rate of HIV in transgender women in North America was 27.7%.&lt;ref name="Herbst et al. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbst|first1=J|title=Estimating HIV prevalence and risk behaviors of Male-to-Female transgender persons in the United States: A systematic review|journal=AIDS and Behavior|date=2008|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1007/s10461-007-9299-3|pmid=17694429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to healthcare===

In the 2010 and 2011 NTDSRs, 19% of the people surveyed reported having been refused medical care due to their gender identity and 50% reported lack of provider knowledge of transgender health needs.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2010 NTDS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Jaime|title=National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on Health and Health Care|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_report_on_health.pdf|website=National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|publisher=National Gay and Lesbian Task Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under the Affordable Care Act, it is illegal for any health program receiving federal funding to discriminate based on gender identity. Discrimination includes refusal to admit, treat or provide any services that are available for other patients; subjection of patients to intrusive examination; harass or refuse to respond to harassment by other staff or patients; refusal to provide support services; obligation to participate in [[conversion therapy]]; and any sort of interference in the pursuit of health care rights.&lt;ref name="ACA Accommodations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Know Your Rights Health Care|url=http://transequality.org/know-your-rights/healthcare|website=Trans Equality|publisher=Trans Equality|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial disparities===

Race has been shown to compound manifestations of existing discrimination on the basis of gender identity.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2010 NTDS" /&gt;
Black trans women have the highest suicide rate of any other group in the United States, at almost half attempting in their lives, while cisgender black women attempt suicide at a rate of 1.7% on average.&lt;ref name="AFSP Facts and Figures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts and Figures|url=https://www.afsp.org/understanding-suicide/facts-and-figures|website=American Foundation for Suicide Prevention|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Trans students of color face higher rates of harassment and violence in schools.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt; American Indian transgender students face the highest rates of sexual assault in school at 24%, followed by multiracial (18%), Asian (17%), and black (15%) students. White transgender students face a 9% rate of sexual assault in K–12.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt;
Black trans women have a higher rate of HIV infection than other groups, with a 30.8–56.3% rate, versus 27.7% of MTF transgender people on average.&lt;ref name="Herbst et al. 2008" /&gt;

====Police and incarceration====

In the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 22% of respondents who had interacted with the police reported harassment due to bias. 20% reported denial of equal services. 48% reported being uncomfortable asking for police assistance. Respondents who had served time in jail reported a higher rate of harassment by officers than by others in jail. For all respondents, 7% reported being held in a jail cell solely due to gender identity expression, while this number was 41% for black and 21% for Latino trans respondents.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt; 
Transgender people have reported being refused medical care, particularly hormone therapy, in prison, with black trans people and American Indian trans people with the highest reporting rates.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2249">A '''type scene''' is a literary convention employed by a narrator across a set of scenes, or related to scenes (place, action) already familiar to the audience. The similarities with, and differences from, the established type are used to illuminate developments in plot and character. As [[Robert Louis Fowler]] wrote, "The technique of the type-scene offers the poet a basic scaffolding, but it also allows the poet to adapt each scene for specific purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Fowler | first=Robert Louis | title=The Cambridge companion to Homer | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-521-01246-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|135}}

Much of the foundational work for such analysis was by Walter Arend in his 1933 ''Die typischen Scenen bei Homer'' book on the ''[[Iliad]]'' of [[Homer]].  Later work by [[Robert Alter]] employed similar examination to parts of the [[Hebrew Bible]], in particular to the betrothal type-scene at the well in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bach | first=Alice | title=Women in the Hebrew Bible | publisher=Routledge | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-415-91561-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45}} Another type scene that Alter identifies is the annunciation of the birth of the hero to a barren woman, such as the birth of [[Samson]] to the [[wife of Manoah]], or the birth of [[Samuel]] to [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]]. Other scholars have suggested other type scenes in the Hebrew Bible, such as the [[Divine Council|heavenly council]], [[theophany]], prophetic concealment and the dying monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Benjamin J. M.|title=What type of a son is Samson?

published by Myrmidion Press. Eden Studios uses ''Unisystem'' under an exclusive license, but has allowed other game companies to license the system. Eden Studios published ''WitchCraft 2nd Edition'' and their original ''All Flesh Must Be Eaten'' games as ''Unisystem'' games. ''Armageddon 2nd Edition'' and a new 2nd Edition of Eden's own ''Conspiracy X'' were later published using this gaming system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What and Who is Eden Studios| publisher = Eden Studios| url = http://www.edenstudios.net/edeninfo.htm| format = bios, information| accessdate = 2008-02-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080119104956/http://www.edenstudios.net/edeninfo.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
''Unisystem'' games use a point-buy system to generate characters.&lt;ref name="Flesh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ConspiracyX"/&gt; Points are spent on Attributes, Skills, Qualities and Metaphysics. Drawbacks can be used to gain extra points.

Attributes represent the character's main six abilities, which in this case are three physical attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution; and three mental attributes: Intelligence, Perception, Willpower.&lt;ref name="Army"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12023.phtml| title=Review of Army of Darkness Roleplaying Game| publisher=[[RPGnet]]|date=March 2006| accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Characters also have a variety of Skills, Qualities and Drawbacks to give the character added perks or faults (respectively). Other Qualities and Drawbacks are of a Supernatural sort and are used to designate a character as a particular type of character (be it a Gifted human, a Vampyre, a Spirit, and so on) or detail what sort of magic they can do.

Actions are resolved by adding together the character's relevant Attribute, the applicable Skill, and a ten-sided die roll, plus any modifiers for difficulty; if the total is nine or greater, the action succeeds. [[Gamemaster]]s (called "Chroniclers" in ''Classic'', and "Directors" in ''Cinematic Unisystem'') are also given tables of successes: characters that get a higher roll than the required nine have bonuses on their final outcome; this table describes how successful they turn out to be, and gives guidelines to figure out the resulting bonuses.

== ''Classic'' versus ''Cinematic'' ==
''Unisystem'' can be divided into two sub-systems: ''Classic'' and ''Cinematic''.
 
''Classic Unisystem'' was developed first and is featured in ''All Flesh Must Be Eaten'', ''[[Armageddon: The End Times|Armageddon]]'', ''Conspiracy X 2.0'', ''[[Terra Primate]]''&lt;ref name="SciFi411"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It is typified by grittier, more realistic play, greater attention to detail in skills and combat, and the use of Secondary Attributes that are typically derived from the Primary Attributes.  Essence, or the measure of life-force and magic, is also central to ''Classic Unisystem'' play.

''Cinematic Unisystem'' was designed to mimic the "cinematic" exploits of characters. First developed for the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (roleplaying game)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer Roleplaying Game]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer Roleplaying Game: Designer Notes|last=Carella |first=C.

''[[Army of Darkness Roleplaying Game|Army of Darkness]]''&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt; and ''[[Ghosts of Albion Roleplaying Game|Ghosts of Albion]]''. ''Cinematic'' features a limited set of skills that cover most situations, no Secondary Attributes or Essence, simplified combat and flat damage resolution. ''Cinematic'' games also feature the use of Drama Points which allow the character to do things above and beyond what they could do under the system alone.

The chief difference between the systems are Drama Points (used only in the Cinematic system), and differences in magic system mechanics.

Despite the differences the two are still largely compatible, though every ''Cinematic Unisystem'' game offers an appendix to convert values from the ''Classic'' system, and the ''Buffy RPG''{{'}}s Magic Box supplement offers an appendix on converting between the ''Buffy'' magic system and the ''WitchCraft'' magic system.

'''Vector field reconstruction'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://prola.aps.org/pdf/PRE/v51/i5/p4262_1 Global Vector Field Reconstruction from a Chaotic Experimental Signal in Copper Electrodissolution.] Letellier C, Le Sceller L , Maréchal E, Dutertre P, Maheu B, Gouesbet G, Fei Z, Hudson JL. Physical Review E, 1995 May;51(5):4262-4266&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of creating a [[vector field]] from experimental or computer generated data, usually with the goal of finding a [[differential equation]] [[Mathematical model|model]] of the system.

A [[differential equation]] [[Mathematical model|model]] is one that describes the value of [[dependent variables]] as they evolve in time or space by giving equations involving those variables and their [[derivative]]s with respect to some [[independent variables]], usually time and/or space. An [[ordinary differential equation]] is one in which the system's dependent variables are functions of only one independent variable. Many physical, chemical, biological and electrical systems are well described by ordinary differential equations. Frequently we assume a system is governed by differential equations, but we do not have exact knowledge of the influence of various factors on the state of the system. For instance, we may have an electrical circuit that in theory is described by a system of ordinary differential equations, but due to the tolerance of [[resistors]], variations of the supply [[voltage]] or interference from outside influences we do not know the exact [[parameters]] of the system. For some systems, especially those that support [[Chaos theory|chaos]], a small change in parameter values can cause a large change in the behavior of the system, so an accurate model is extremely important. Therefore, it may be necessary to construct more exact differential equations by building them up based on the actual system performance rather than a theoretical model. Ideally, one would measure all the dynamical variables involved over an extended period of time, using many different [[initial conditions]], then build or fine tune a differential equation model based on these measurements.

In some cases we may not even know enough about the processes involved in a system to even formulate a model. In other cases, we may have access to only one dynamical variable for our measurements, i.e., we have a scalar [[time series]]. If we only have a scalar time series, we need to use the method of time [[delay embedding]] or [[derivative coordinates]] to get a large enough set of dynamical variables to describe the system.

In a nutshell, once we have a set of measurements of the system state over some period of time, we find the derivatives of these measurements, which gives us a local vector field, then determine a global vector field consistent with this local field. This is usually done by a [[least squares]] fit to the derivative data.

==Formulation==

In the best possible case, one has data streams of  measurements of all the system variables, equally spaced in time, say

:s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(t), s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(t), ... , s&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(t)

for

: ''t'' = ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,

beginning at several different initial conditions. Then the task of finding a vector field, and thus a differential equation model consists of fitting functions, for instance, a [[cubic spline]], to the data to obtain a set of continuous time functions

:x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(t), x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(t), ... , x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(t),

computing time derivatives dx&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/dt, dx&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/dt,...,dx&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;/dt of the functions, then making a [[least squares]] fit using some sort of orthogonal basis functions ([[orthogonal polynomials]], [[radial basis functions]], etc.) to each component of the tangent vectors to find a global vector field. A differential equation then can be read off the global vector field.

There are various methods of creating the basis functions for the least squares fit.  The most common method is the [[Gram–Schmidt process]]. Which creates a set of orthogonal basis vectors, which can then easily be normalized.  This method begins by first selecting any standard basis β={v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}.  Next, set the first vector v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, we set u&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-proj&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This process is repeated to for k vectors, with the final vector being u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;= v&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;-∑&lt;sub&gt;(j=1)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(k-1)&lt;/sup&gt;proj&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. This then creates a set of orthogonal standard basis vectors.

The reason for using a standard orthogonal basis rather than a standard basis arises from the creation of the least squares fitting done next.  Creating a least-squares fit begins by assuming some function, in the case of the reconstruction an n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; degree polynomial, and fitting the curve to the data using constants.  The accuracy of the fit can be increased by increasing the degree of the polynomial being used to fit the data.  If a set of non-orthogonal standard basis functions was used, it becomes necessary to recalculate the constant coefficients of the function describing the fit.  However, by using the orthogonal set of basis functions, it is not necessary to recalculate the constant coefficients.

==Applications==

Vector field reconstruction has several applications, and many different approaches.  Some mathematicians have not only used radial basis functions and polynomials to reconstruct a vector field, but they have used [[Lyapunov exponent]]s and [[singular value decomposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Global vector-field reconstruction of nonlinear dynamical system from a time series with SVD method and validation with Lyapunov exponent. Wei-Dong L, Ren F K, Meunier-Guttin-Cluzel S., Gouesbet G. Chin. Phys. Soc, 2003 December; Vol 12 No 12:1366-1373&lt;/ref&gt;  Gouesbet and Letellier used a multivariate polynomial approximation and least squares to reconstruct their vector field. This method was applied to the [[Rössler system]], and the [[Lorenz system]], as well as [[thermal lens oscillations]].

The Rossler system, Lorenz system and Thermal lens oscillation follows the differential equations in standard system as

:X'=Y, Y'=Z and Z'=F(X,Y,Z)

where F(X,Y,Z) is known as the standard function.&lt;ref&gt;Global vector field reconstruction by using a multivariate polynomial ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; approximation on nets. Gouesbet G. and Letellier C. Physical Review E, 1994 June; Vol 49, No 6: 4955-4972&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation issues==

In some situation the model is not very efficient and difficulties can arise if the model has a large number of coefficients and demonstrates a divergent solution.  For example, nonautonomous differential equations give the previously described results.&lt;ref&gt;Constructing nonautonomous differential equations from experimental time series. Bezruchko B.P and Smirnov D.A. Physical Review E, 2000; Vol 63, 016207:1-7&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the modification of the standard approach in application gives a better way of further development of global vector reconstruction.

Usually the system being modeled in this way is a [[chaotic dynamical system]], because chaotic systems explore a large part of the [[phase space]] and the estimate of the global dynamics based on the local dynamics will be better than with a system exploring only a small part of the space.

Frequently, one has only a single scalar time series measurement from a system known to have more than one [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]]. The time series may not even be from a system variable, but may be instead of a function of all the variables, such as temperature in a stirred tank reactor using several chemical species. In this case, one must use the technique of [[delay coordinate embedding]],&lt;ref&gt;Embedology, Tim Sauer, James A. Yorke, and Martin Casdagli, Santa Fe Institute working paper&lt;/ref&gt; where a state vector consisting of the data at time t and several delayed versions of the data is constructed.

A comprehensive review of the topic is available from &lt;ref&gt;G. Gouesbet, S. Meunier-Guttin-Cluzel and O. Ménard, editors. Chaos and its reconstruction. Novascience Publishers, New-York (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ottawa v Tampa Bay refs goal fight April 22 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Official (ice hockey)|Linesmen]] attempt to break up a fight around the Tampa Bay goal during the first ice hockey playoff game between the [[Ottawa Senators]] and the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]].]]

'''[[Violence]]''' has been a part of [[ice hockey]] since at least the early 1900s. According to the book ''[[Hockey: A People's History]]'', in 1904 alone, four players were killed during hockey games from the frequent brawls and violent stickwork.&lt;ref name="PeopleHistory"&gt;
{{cite video|people=Drewery, Laine (Writer and Director), Chong,Wayne (Producer)|date=2006|title=Hockey: A People's History, Episode 1 - A simple game, DVD Chapter&amp;nbsp;— From sport to spectacle|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More modern examples of violence include brawls, fan involvement, physical abuse of officials and deliberately injuring opponents. Violent actions such as kicking, hitting from behind and prohibited stickwork, are penalized with suspensions or fines. [[Fighting in ice hockey|Fighting]], or fisticuffs, is also penalized but is considered by many hockey enthusiasts, particularly in [[North America]], to be quite distinct from stick-swinging or other violent acts. They regard fighting as an entrenched, acceptable and integral part of the game.

On the ice, referees may impose [[Ice hockey#Penalties|penalties]] for prohibited activities. Off the ice, the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) sometimes fines, suspends or expels players. The criminal justice system has also been known to investigate, charge and convict players. As a result, hockey has become much more regulated and the violent element much more controlled. This has been aided, in no small part, by dramatic increases in disciplinary processes and technology allowing for a high level of scrutiny of any event which occurs.

==History==
Early hockey in particular was noted for its extreme violence, to the point where two players were killed in three years during brawls.  In both cases, the accused assailants were acquitted, but these and other bloody incidents led to calls for the sport to clean up its act or be banned along with the likes of [[cockfighting]].&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, Michael: "Hockey: A People's History," pages 27-28.  McClelland &amp; Stewart, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The worst of the violence waned, particularly with the advent of regulations for quasi-legal fisticuffs, though incidents continue to occur from time to time.

[[Billy Coutu]] was the first, and to date only, player banned from the NHL for life for violence in 1927; he assaulted [[referee (hockey)|referee]] Jerry Laflamme and tackled referee Billy Bell before starting a [[bench-clearing brawl]] during a [[Stanley Cup]] game between the [[Boston Bruins]] and [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]], apparently on the orders of Bruins Head Coach [[Art Ross]]. The NHL's first president, [[Frank Calder]], expelled Coutu from the NHL for life; the ban was lifted after two-and-a-half years, but Coutu never played in the NHL again.

Other incidents include the December 12, 1933, event when [[Eddie Shore]] rammed [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] star [[Ace Bailey]] from behind, causing Bailey to strike his head on the ice; Bailey never played hockey again. More recently, controversy and criminal charges have resulted from violent attacks by [[Marty McSorley]], [[Todd Bertuzzi]] and [[Chris Simon]].

Players who are banned in the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) for violence are not permitted in the [[ECHL]], and vice versa, because of their agreements with the [[Professional Hockey Players' Association]].

In January 2012, [[David Johnston]], the [[Governor General of Canada]], said that violence such as headshots, high-sticking and fighting should not be part of the sport.&lt;ref name="govgen"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/01/26/pol-gg-hockey-fighting-pnp.html | title=Fighting has no place in hockey, GG says | publisher=CBC | date=January 26, 2012 | accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports investigating violence==
There have been two major Canadian reports on violence in hockey. In 1974, William McMurtry provided a report for the [[Government of Ontario]] entitled ''Investigation and Inquiry into Violence in Amateur Hockey''. In 2000, [[Bernie Pascall]] prepared a report for the [[Government of British Columbia]] entitled ''Eliminating Violence in Hockey''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hockeynanaimo.com/informationPDFs/WorkingPaper.pdf Violence, Not Part of Youth Hockey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821133720/http://www.hockeynanaimo.com/informationPDFs/WorkingPaper.pdf |date=2007-08-21 }}, pilot project working paper, [[Nanaimo]] Minor Hockey Association, September 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==On-ice incidents resulting in charges==
*1905 – [[Allan Loney]] was charged with [[manslaughter]] in the on-ice clubbing death of [[Alcide Laurin]].  Loney claimed self-defence, and was found not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, Michael: "Hockey: A People's History," page 27.  McClelland &amp; Stewart, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1907 – Ottawa Senators players [[Harry Smith (ice hockey)|Harry Smith]], [[Alf Smith (ice hockey)|Alf Smith]] and Charles Spittal were charged with assault after beating [[Montreal Wanderers]] players [[Hod Stuart]], Ernie "Moose" Johnson and [[Cecil Blatchford]] with their sticks.
*1907 – Ottawa Victorias player [[Charles Masson]] was charged with manslaughter after Cornwall player [[Owen McCourt]] died of a head wound sustained in a brawl.  Masson was found not guilty on the grounds that there was no way to know which blow had killed McCourt.&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, Michael: "Hockey: A People's History," page 28.  McClelland &amp; Stewart, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1922 – [[Sprague Cleghorn]] injured three Ottawa Senators players in a brawl, leading Ottawa police to offer to arrest him.
*1969 – In a pre-season game held in Ottawa, [[Ted Green]] of the Boston Bruins and [[Wayne Maki]] of the [[St. Louis Blues]] engaged in a violent, stick-swinging brawl. A fractured skull and brain damage caused Green to miss the entire [[1969–70 NHL season|1969–70 season]].&lt;ref name="lowlights"&gt;{{Harvnb|CBC Sports|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NHL suspended Maki for 30 days and Green for 13 games. Both men were acquitted in court.
*1975 – [[Dan Maloney]] of the [[Detroit Red Wings]] was charged with [[assault]] causing bodily harm after he attacked [[Brian Glennie]] of the Toronto Maple Leafs from behind. In exchange for a no-contest plea, Maloney did community service work and was banned from playing in Toronto for two seasons.
*1975 – Police charged Bruins player [[Dave Forbes]] with [[Assault#Aggravated assault|aggravated assault]] after a fight with [[Henry Boucha]] of the [[Minnesota North Stars]]. After a nine-day trial ended with a hung jury, charges against Forbes were dropped. Boucha suffered blurred vision from the incident and never fully recovered.
*1976 – [[Philadelphia Flyers]] players [[Joe Watson (ice hockey)|Joe Watson]], [[Mel Bridgman]], [[Don Saleski]] and [[Bob "Hound" Kelly]] were charged with assault after using their hockey sticks as weapons in a violent playoff game between the Flyers and the Toronto Maple Leafs in which fans had been taunting the Flyers players and spitting at them. Bridgman was acquitted, but the other three Flyers were found guilty of simple assault.
*1976 – [[Calgary Cowboys]] forward [[Rick Jodzio]] plead guilty to a charge of assault following a cross-check to the head of [[Quebec Nordiques]] player [[Marc Tardif]] during the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) playoffs. The hit led to a 20-minute bench clearing brawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Willes |first=Ed |year=2004 |title=The Rebel League |publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart |isbn=0-7710-8947-3 |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1977 – [[Tiger Williams|Dave "Tiger" Williams]] of the Toronto Maple Leafs hit the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]' [[Dennis Owchar]] with his stick. He was charged with assault, but acquitted.
*1982 – [[Jimmy Mann (ice hockey)|Jimmy Mann]] of the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg Jets]] left the bench and sucker-punched Pittsburgh Penguin [[Paul Gardner (ice hockey)|Paul Gardner]], breaking Gardner's jaw in two places. Mann was fined $500 and given a suspended sentence in Winnipeg.
*1988 – [[Dino Ciccarelli]] hit Maple Leafs defenceman [[Luke Richardson]] with his stick. Charged and convicted of assault, he was sentenced to one day in jail and fined $1,000.
*1992 – [[Enrico Ciccone]] of the [[International Hockey League (1945–2001)|IHL]]'s [[Kalamazoo Wings (1974–2000)|Kalamazoo Wings]] was arrested on a battery charge after [[San Diego Gulls (1990–95)|San Diego Gulls]] photographer Essy Ghavameddini was cut and received a deep bruise below his left eye that required stitches. Ciccone assaulted him after entering the penalty box where Ghavameddini was photographing the game from.&lt;ref&gt;Arrest Mars Gulls Game. Los Angeles Times. 8 November 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1998 – [[Jesse Boulerice]] of the [[Plymouth Whalers]] was suspended for the rest of the playoffs after violently swinging his stick at [[Guelph Storm]] forward Andrew Long. Boulerice was charged with assault as a result of the incident.
*2000 – [[Marty McSorley]] of the Boston Bruins hit [[Vancouver Canucks|Vancouver Canuck]] [[Donald Brashear]] in the head with his stick in the waning moments of the game, after losing a fight to Brashear earlier in the game. McSorley was convicted of assault with a weapon and given an 18-month conditional discharge.
*2004 – In the [[Todd Bertuzzi–Steve Moore incident]], Bertuzzi of the Vancouver Canucks [[sucker punch|sucker-punched]] [[Steve Moore (ice hockey)|Moore]] of the Colorado Avalanche in the back of the head, knocking him unconscious. The pair then fell to the ice with Bertuzzi's weight crushing Moore face-first into the ice, followed by several players from both teams further piling onto the [[mêlée]].  Moore sustained three fractured vertebrae, a [[Concussion#Grading systems|grade three concussion]], vertebral ligament damage, stretching of the brachial plexus nerves and facial lacerations. Bertuzzi was charged by police and given a conditional discharge after pleading guilty to assault causing bodily harm. His suspension resulted in a loss of $500,000 in pay and the Canucks were fined $250,000. Bertuzzi was re-instated in 2005, after a 20 game suspension and an international ban during the 2004-05 lockout season. A civil suit filed by Moore, seeking CAD$68 million in damages and loss of income, was settled on August 19, 2014. The terms of this settlement are confidential.
*2015 - During the warm up before a qualifier to the [[Swedish Hockey League|SHL]], [[André Deveaux]] from [[Rögle BK]] assaulted [[Västerås IK]]'s unsuspecting [[Per Helmersson]]. Deveaux swung his stick and slashed Helmersson twice. The attack was retaliation for a hit from behind by Helmersson in the game before, which Deveaux claimed caused him a minor concussion. Both players could complete both games, and Deveaux was only disciplined after the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/2015-05-08/deveaux-jag-kommer-inte-att-be-om-ursakt|title=Deveaux: "Jag kommer inte att be om ursäkt"|author=|date=|website=sydsvenskan.se|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/hockey/sverige/shl/rogle/article20546133.ab|title=Överfallet under uppvärmningen|author=|date=|website=aftonbladet.se|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deveaux was charged for the attack, but the charges were later dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/hockey/sverige/allsvenskan/article21101116.ab|title=Andre Deveaux slipper åtal|author=|date=|website=aftonbladet.se|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
