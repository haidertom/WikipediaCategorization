Between 1890 and 1918, [[Scramble for Africa|Western colonial expansion in Africa]] led to the removal of many pieces of sub-Saharan [[African art]] that were subsequently brought to Europe and displayed.&lt;ref name="Coombes 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coombes|first=Annie E.|title=Reinventing Africa : museums, material culture and popular imagination in late Victorian and Edwardian England|year=1997|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300068905|edition=2nd pr}}&lt;/ref&gt; These objects entered the collections of natural history museums, art museums (both encyclopedic and specialist) and private collections in Europe and the United States.

==The removal of African artworks from their source countries during the 19th Century==
Before the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885, traders and explorers to Africa bought or stole art as souvenirs and [[wikt:curios|curios]],&lt;ref name="Schildkrout and Keim" /&gt; speading beyond the coast; ivory objects made along African coasts had been collected for centuries, and many were made by Africans for European markets in a style matching European taste, mainly in areas reached by the Portuguese, the [[Kongo_ivories#Afro-Portuguese_ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]]. The period dominated by curio collecting, in which objects served as souvenirs, was followed by a period of trophy collecting in which large collections of artifacts (mostly weapons), and animal skins, horns, and tusks from hunting expeditions, were a tangible means of showing penetration, conquest and domination.&lt;ref name="Schildkrout and Keim"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Scramble for Art in Central Africa|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|editor=Enid Schildkrout and Curtis A. Keim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1870s, thousands of African sculptures arrived in Europe in the aftermath of colonial conquest and exploratory expeditions. They were placed on view in museums such as the [[Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro]], founded in 1878 in Paris, and its counterparts in other European cities.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; At the time, these objects were treated as artifacts of colonized cultures rather than as artworks and were very cheap, often sold in flea markets and pawnshops.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences"&gt;{{cite web|last=Denise|first=Murrell|title=African Influences in Modern Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/aima/hd_aima.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European collections==
[[File:Musée du Congo, Tervuren, Belgium; one of five interior scen Wellcome V0014543.jpg|thumb|Art on display at the [[Royal Museum of Central Africa]].]]

The different histories of museums inEurope and the United States affected the collecting and display of African art in both places.&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt; European museums typically were founded as state institutions and thus their collections and displays were shaped by national interests. The appreciation of African objects purely as fine art in Europe was largely limited to private galleries in the early twentieth century. In Paris, dealers such [[Paul Guillaume]], [[Charles Ratton]] and [[Louis Carre]] played a role in the formation of major private collections of African art. The latter half of the twentieth century saw the opening of the first European art museums devoted to collecting and displaying African art, including the [[Barbier-Mueller Museum|Musee Barbier-Mueller]] in Geneva (1977), the [[Musee Dapper]] in Paris (1986),&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt; but many if not most general national art museums by then had collections.

===Royal Museum for Central Africa in Belgium===
In 1897, [[King Leopold II]] took advantage of the [[Brussels International Exhibition]] in [[Tervuren]] to promote his holdings of the [[Congo Free State|Congo]]. The [[Brussels International (1897)|1897 International Exhibition]] piqued scientific interest in the people and animals of Central Africa, thus King Leopold II decided to build on his promotion of Congo. The [[Royal Museum of Central Africa]] was established in 1898 as a permanent museum and scientific institution responsible for mounting exhibitions for the Belgian public and encouraging the study of Central Africa.&lt;ref name="Royal Museum for Central Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=History: From Congo Museum to RMCA|url=http://www.africamuseum.be/museum/about-us/museum/history/Congomuseum|work=Royal Museum for Central Africa|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Museum===

The Sainsbury African Galleries in the [[British Museum]] in London display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the Museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir [[Henry Wellcome]], which was donated by the [[Wellcome Collection|Wellcome Historical Medical Museum]] in 1954. 

Highlights of the African collection include the [[Benin Bronzes|Benin]] and [[Igbo-Ukwu]] bronze sculptures, the beautiful [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], a magnificent [[Bronze Head from Ife|brass head]] of a Yoruba ruler from [[Ife]], the [[Apapa Hoard]] from Lagos, southern Nigeria, a dozen exquisite [[Kongo ivories#Afro-Portuguese ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]], Asante goldwork from Ghana including the [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Bowdich]] collection, the rare [[Akan Drum]] from the same region in West Africa, a series of soapstone figures from the [[Kissi people]] in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the [[Emil Torday|Torday]] collection of Central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry, important material from Ethiopia following the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]], the unique [[Luzira Head]] from Uganda, excavated objects from [[Great Zimbabwe]] and satellite towns such as [[Mutare]] including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the [[Venda]] peoples and cave paintings and [[petroglyph]]s from [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|South Africa]].


The [[Benin Bronzes]] were seized by a [[United Kingdom|British]] force in the [[Benin Expedition of 1897]] and given to the British [[Foreign Office]]. As Paula Girshick Ben-Amos, a professor of anthropology and African Studies at Indiana University, states in The Art of Benin, “art of the Benin Kingdom came to public and scholarly attention in the West in 1897 when members of a British Punitive Expedition brought out thousands of objects as war booty.”2

Around 200 of the bronzes were passed on to the British Museum, while the remainder were divided among a variety of collections, with the majority being purchased by [[Felix von Luschan]] on behalf of the ''Königliches Museum für Völkerkunde'' in [[Berlin]] (the present-day [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin|Ethnological Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Luschan|first=Feliz|title=Die Altertümer von Benin|year=1919|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Oba [[Akenzua II]] began the movement to return the corpus of objects now known in modern discourse as the 'Benin Bronzes'.

===Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro===
The Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro was the first [[Anthropology|anthropological]] museum in Paris, founded in 1878. It closed in 1935 when the building that housed it, the [[Trocadéro#The old Palais du Trocadéro|Trocadéro Palace]], was demolished; its descendant is the [[Musée de l'Homme]], housed in the [[Trocadéro#The new Palais de Chaillot|Palais de Chaillot]] on the same site, and its French collections formed the nucleus of the [[Musée national des Arts et Traditions Populaires (France)|Musée National des Arts et Traditions Populaires]], also in the Palais de Chaillot. Numerous [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] and [[Cubism|Cubist]] artists discovered African art at the Trocadéro Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Paul Crespelle, ''The Fauves'', tr. Anita Brookner, Greenwich, Connecticut: New York Graphic Society, 1962, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=fLIcTrzKNJOssAPtgrmhBQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=yxcOAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Fauves+Trocad%C3%A9ro&amp;q=In+1904%2C+the+two+had+been+in+the+habit+of+visiting+the+Trocadero+Museum+%E2%80%94+ancestor+of+the+Musee+de+I%27Homme+%E2%80%94+to+look+at+the+African+and+Polynesian+collections.+They+regarded+them+simply+as+curiosities%2C+and+it+was+not+until#search_anchor p. 114].&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso said that this art taught him "what painting was all about", seeing it in the museum's African masks, which had been created "as a kind of mediation between [humanity] and the unknown hostile forces that [surround us]",&lt;ref name=Gilot266&gt;Françoise Gilot and Carlton Lake, ''Life with Picasso'', 1964, repr. New York: Anchor/Doubleday, 1989, {{ISBN|978-0-385-26186-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=9eEZTuqRHoiisAPa8fDPDQ&amp;ct=result&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=8TfYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Picasso+depressed+Gilot&amp;q=Trocadero#search_anchor p. 266].&lt;/ref&gt;  and to have been influenced by the masks in the forms of the figures in [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]], which eventually led to Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;According to Christopher Green, ''Picasso: Architecture and Vertigo'', New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-300-10412-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e2V5dnM_x4UC&amp;pg=PA51 p. 51] this is "generally accepted" although denied by Picasso himself.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur I. Miller]], ''Einstein, Picasso: Space, Time and the Beauty that Causes Havoc'', New York: Basic, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-465-01859-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VEPaSUitrDkC&amp;pg=PA92 p. 92]: [A]lthough the sharp change in the right-hand demoiselles occurred after Picasso's visit to Trocadéro, . . . . [i]t turns out that African art supported his conceptual approach and convinced him of the deep meaning of geometry as the language of the new art."&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the African collection has since been transferred to the [[Musee du Quai Branly]].

==African art in ethnological collections==
[[File:Drum - Kongo - Royal Museum for Central Africa - DSC05703.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Kongo people|Kongo]] drum in the ethnographic collection of the Royal Museum for Central Africa.]]
Initially, all African art objects were viewed as [[ethnographic]] specimens.  Notably, during the period of 1890 through 1913, all large museums redefined their public image in terms of an educational prerogative.&lt;ref name="Coombes 1997" /&gt; In response to the debate around the use of the terms ''curio'' and ''curiosity'', the League of the Empire in 1904 recommended the "orderly arrangement and the transformation of mere curios into objects of scientific interest by appropriate classification."{{Ref|1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|journal=Museums Journal|date=September 1904|volume=4|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, as a means of validating the expansion of ethnographic collections, the rhetoric often employed was one of the necessity of conservation and preservation in the face of the inevitable extinction of the producers of the materials culture in their custody (121).

[[Stewart Culin]], curator at the [[Brooklyn Museum]], was the first American curator to display ethnological collections as art objects, not as ethnographic specimens, which he did in 1923. Culin distinguished his installation from those of contemporaneous ethnological collections at institutions such as the [[American Museum of Natural History]] and the [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]] in saying that "the objects of Negro art which are displayed publicly form part of museum collections of African ethnology and receive no special attention at the hands of ethnologists...

''Art/Artifact'', an exhibition organized by [[Susan Vogel]] in 1988, presented 160 objects of art and ethnography selected from the [[Buffalo Museum of Science]], the [[Hampton University Museum]] (Virginia), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] (New York City). All three are anthropology museums founded in the 1860s with distinguished African collections. The exhibition examined the shifting definitions of art and artifact, and dealt with the question of how we look at objects from traditional African cultures whose classification systems differ from contemporary Western culture.

==African art and Western Modernism==
During the early 1900s, the aesthetics of traditional African sculpture became a powerful influence among European artists who formed an avant-garde in the development of modern art, known as the "[[Primitivism]]" movement.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; In France, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and their [[School of Paris]] friends blended the highly stylized treatment of the human figure in African sculptures with painting styles derived from the [[post-Impressionist]] works of [[Cézanne]] and [[Gauguin]]. The resulting pictorial flatness, vivid color palette, and fragmented [[Cubist]] shapes helped to define early [[modernism]]. While these artists knew nothing of the original meaning and function of the West and Central African sculptures they encountered, they claimed to instantly recognize the spiritual aspect of the composition and to adapt these qualities to their own efforts to move beyond the naturalism that had defined Western art since the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt;

[[German Expressionist]] painters such as [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] of [[Die Brücke]] (The Bridge) group, based in [[Dresden]] and [[Berlin]], conflated African aesthetics with the emotional intensity of dissonant color tones and figural distortion, to depict the anxieties of modern life, while [[Paul Klee]] of the [[Blaue Reiter]] (Blue Rider) in [[Munich]] developed transcendent symbolic imagery.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; The Expressionists' interest in non-Western art intensified after a 1910 [[Gauguin]] exhibition in [[Dresden]], while modernist movements in Italy, England, and the United States initially engaged with African art through contacts with School of Paris artists. These [[avant-garde]] artists, their dealers, and leading critics of the era were among the first Europeans to collect African sculptures for their aesthetic value.

==American collections==
The 1913 [[Armory Show]] marked a seminal moment for America’s [[avant-garde]]. An exposition of about 1,300 works, it introduced the New York art audience to movements like [[Cubism]], [[Fauvism]] and [[Futurism]], as well as the work of European artists including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. The Armory Show and its promotion of [[Modernism]] also helped create a taste and a market for African art in New York.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt;

Notably, in 1914 two New York galleries introduced African sculpture to their audiences: [[Robert J. Coady]]’s newly opened [[Washington Square Gallery]] and [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s well-established [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession]]. Stieglitz’s held an exhibition in 1914 dedicated entirely to African artifacts as works of art.&lt;ref name="Met Press Room" /&gt;

New York City progressively positioned itself as a central marketplace for African art.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; During the years 1915-19, American dealers began promoting African objects as art to a growing group of collectors. Among the dealers, Mexican artist [[Marius de Zayas]] (1880–1961) was largely responsible for helping some adventurous modern-art collectors, including [[Walter Arensberg|Walter and Louise Arensberg]], [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], and Agnes and [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]], to build their African art collections. During the early 1920s, several American institutions began opening their doors to African art.&lt;ref name="Met Press Room"&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Exhibition Tells Story of How African Artifacts Were First Recognized as Art in U.S.|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2012/african-art-new-york-and-the-avant-garde|work=Press Room|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brooklyn Museum===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 69.133.5 Mask.jpg|thumb|upright|A mask of the [[We people]] at the Brooklyn Museum.]]
In 1903, [[Stewart Culin]] (1858–1929) became the founding curator of the Department of Ethnology at the Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, now the [[Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref name="Siegmann 2009" /&gt;  Culin, a self-taught ethnologist, built the foundation of four curatorial collections for the Museum, acquiring objects representing African, Asian, Native American, and Eastern European cultures. Culin was among the first curators to recognize museum installation as an art form. He was also among the first to display ethnological collections as art objects, not as ethnographic specimens. This approach is evidenced in his exhibition "Primitive Negro Art, Chiefly from the Belgian Congo". The exhibition opened in April 1923, and displayed African objects he had acquired in Europe from dealers.

===Barnes Foundation===
[[Albert C. Barnes|Albert Barnes]] was one of the first American collectors to selectively acquire an extensive collection of African sculpture purely on aesthetic merits. In 1923, two years before the [[Barnes Foundation]] opening in [[Merion]], Pennsylvania, Barnes wrote, "When the foundation opens, negro art will have a place among the great manifestations of all times."&lt;ref&gt;Albert C. Barnes to Paul Guillaume, November 5, 1923, the Barnes Foundation Archives, Merion, Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his active promotion of the foundation's collection of African sculpture and its aesthetic importance, Barnes himself played a critical role in fostering appreciation of African art in the United States in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt;

===Museum of Primitive Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art===

Founded in 1954 by [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]] and [[Rene d'Harnoncourt]], the [[Museum of Primitive Art]] was the first art museum exclusively devoted to exhibiting and collecting works of art from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas for their aesthetic value rather than as ethnographic documents or colonial trophies.&lt;ref name="Ezra 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ezra|first=Kate|title=Representing Africa in American art museums : a century of collecting and display|year=2010|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|isbn=9780295989617|authorlink=Collecting African Art at New York's Museum of Primitive Art|editor=Kathleen Bickford Berzock, Christa Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum closed in 1974, and its collection, staff and library were transferred to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] according to an agreement made between Rockefeller and the Met in 1969. The Museum of Primitive Art was in many ways an outgrowth of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA).&lt;ref name="Ezra 2010" /&gt;  It was located directly behind MoMA and was also built on Rockefeller-owned property. Rockefeller was MoMA's president and d'Harnoncourt was its director. MoMA's 1935 landmark exhibition African Negro Art was influential in shaping the director of the Museum of Primitive Art.&lt;ref name="Ezra 2010" /&gt; Today, the Museum of Primitive Art collection is housed in the Metropolitan Michael C. Rockefeller Wing.

===National Museum of African Art===
The [[National Museum of African Art]] in Washington D.C. was founded by [[Warren M. Robbins]] in 1964 as a private and relatively small collection. In 1979 the collection, by then about 8,000 objects, was taken over by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and is now housed in a central if underground location on the [[National Mall]].

==Problems of display==
Many scholars and curators have debated the efficacy of different modes of display of African art in Western museums. Generally, scholars agree that the Western art museum was, and continues to be, incompatible with the contexts from which most traditional [[African arts]] emerged. The following quotation from Kathleen Bickford Berzock and Christa Clarke's introduction to their book ''Representing Africa in American Art Museum'' summarizes the reasons for this incompatibility:

{{quote|text="Art museums reinforced hierarchies of value based on media or genre, favoring paintings and sculpture created solely for artistic appreciation. In contrast, the visual arts of Africa encompass not only sculpture in wood and metal but also beadwork, textiles, basketry, and other works of diverse media, all of which may hold equal value for their creators. And while aesthetics may guide the production of art in Africa, often there are other social, religious, or political concerns that inform its design and use. With this range of forms and materials and the different circumstances of creation and use within society, the diverse arts of Africa were not suited to the aesthetic hierarchies and systems of classification established by art museums. Moreover, museum practices of collecting and display emphasized the artist as individual genius, the school of artists working in a similar style and vein, and chronology. Such categorization was not easily replicated with African objects, which were often collected with fragmentary documentation that rarely identified the individual artist or the specific time period of creation."&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berzock|first=Kathleen Bickford|title=Representing Africa in American Art Museums|year=2011|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle &amp; London|pages=3–19|authorlink=A Historical Introduction|author2=Christa Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Post-1980s African Art==
Post-1980s [[curator]]ial approaches to collecting and displaying historical African art tend towards greater specialization, broadening definitions, and a desire for contextualization.&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt;

Curatorial debate surrounds questions about where boundaries should be drawn between traditional and modern, between African and the [[African diaspora]] in the Americas and Europe, and between [[sub-Saharan]] and [[North African]] art. In certain instances, tradition-based and contemporary works have been exhibited together, a practice that began with the exhibition "Astonishment and Power: Kingo Minkisi &amp; the Art of Renee Stout" at the National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Atwood ARTnews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Atwood|first=Roger|title=African Art: Beyond the Masks|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/09/17/beyond-the-masks/|accessdate=16 October 2013|newspaper=ARTnews|date=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this exhibition was criticized for suggesting a cultural continuity between pre-modern African art and African-American art today while ignoring crucial cultural differences between these two bodies of work.&lt;ref name="Cotter 1993"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cotter|first=Holland|title=ART VIEW; Art That's Valued for What It Can Do|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/arts/art-view-art-that-s-valued-for-what-it-can-do.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=16 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Benin]] artist [[Meschac Gaba]]'s installation "Museum of Contemporary African Art" at [[Tate Modern]] belies the fact that there is no such thing as a museum of [[contemporary African art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Contemporary African Art|url=http://www.museumofcontemporaryafricanart.com/entree.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
:1.{{Note|1}}In 1903, the League of the Empire was founded in England with the aim of bringing children from different parts of the [[British Empire|Empire]] into contact with one another through correspondence, lectures and exchanges. A distinguished group of museum directors and officials headed a sub-committee of the League entitled 'School Museum Committee.'

In the context of [[broadcasting]], '''backhaul''' refers to uncut program content that is transmitted [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] to an individual [[television station]] or [[radio station]], [[broadcast network]] or other receiving entity where it will be integrated into a finished [[TV show]] or [[radio show]]. The term is independent of the medium being used to send the backhaul, but [[communications satellite]] transmission is very common. When the medium is satellite, it is called a [[wildfeed]].

Backhauls are also referred to sometimes as "[[Clean feed (TV)|clean feeds]]", being "clean" in the sense that they lack any of the [[post-production]] elements that are added later to the feed's content (i.e. [[digital on-screen graphic|on-screen graphic]]s, [[voice-overs]], [[bumper (media)|bumpers]], etc.) during the integration of the backhaul feed into a finished show.  In live [[sports]] production, a backhaul is used to obtain live game [[footage]] (usually for later repackaging in highlights shows) when an off-air source is not readily available. In this instance the feed that is being obtained contains all elements except for [[TV commercial]]s or [[radio ad]]s run by the host network's [[master control]]. This is particularly useful for obtaining live coverage of post-game press conferences or extended game highlights ("melts"), since the backhaul may stay up to feed these events after the network has concluded their broadcast.

[[Electronic news gathering]], including "live via satellite" [[interview]]s, [[reporter]]s' [[live shot]]s, and [[sporting event]]s are all examples of [[radio]] or [[television]] content that is backhauled to a station or network before being made available to the public through that station or network.  [[Cable TV]] channels, particularly [[public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) along with ([[Public-access television|local origination]]) channels, may also backhauled to [[cable headend]]s before making their way to the subscriber.  Finished [[Network affiliate|network]] feeds are not considered backhauls, even if [[local insertion]] is used to modify the content prior to final transmission.

There exists a dedicated group of enthusiasts who use [[TVRO]] (TV receive-only) gear such as [[big ugly dish]]es or "BUDs" to peek in on backhaul signals that are available on any of the dozens of [[broadcast satellite]]s that are visible from almost any point on Earth. In its early days, their hobby was strengthened by the fact that most backhaul was [[analog (signal)|analog]] and "[[in the clear]]" (unscrambled or unencrypted) which made for a vast smorgasbord of free television available for the technically inclined amateur. In recent years, full-time content and cable channels have added [[encryption]] and [[conditional access]], and occasional signals are steadily becoming [[digital broadcasting|digital]], which has had a deleterious effect on the hobby.

Some digital signals remain [[free-to-air|freely accessible]] (sometimes using [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] dishes as small as one meter) under the international [[DVB-S]] standard or the US [[Motorola]]-proprietary [[Digicipher]] system. The small dishes may either be fixed (much like [[direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] antennas), positioned using a [[electric motor|rotor]] (usually [[DiSEqC]]-standard) or may be [[toroid]]al in design (twin toroidal [[Reflector (antenna)|reflector]]s focus the incoming signal as a line, not a point, so that multiple [[Low-noise block converter|LNB]]s may receive signal from multiple satellites). A "blind-search" receiver is often used to try every possible combination of frequency and [[bitrate]] to search for backhaul signals on individual communication satellites.

==Documentaries containing backhauled content==
The 1992 [[documentary film|documentary]] ''Feed'' &lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|id=0104244|title=Feed}}&lt;/ref&gt; was compiled almost entirely using unedited backhaul from [[political campaign]] coverage by local and network television.  A similar documentary about the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 U.S. presidential election]] named ''[[Spin (documentary)|Spin]]'' was made in the same way in 1995.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3250">'''Barrier cable''' is a vehicular or pedestrian restraint system used in [[parking garage]]s.  It installed along the ramps or around the perimeter of the parking structure.  It consists of a 0.5-inch, 7-wire steel strand which is similar to the strand used in [[Post-tensioned concrete]].

==Types==
There are three types of barrier cables systems:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amsyscoinc.com/2010/03/23/barrier-cable/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galvanized===
[[Galvanized steel|Galvanized]] barrier cable is the most prevalent type of barrier cable used today.  The steel strand is [[Zinc plated]] to protect it from corrosion per ASTM A475.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsiamerica.com/references/domestic-buildings/barrier-cable-for-parking-structures-ca-usa.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203132916/http://www.dsiamerica.com/references/domestic-buildings/barrier-cable-for-parking-structures-ca-usa.html |archivedate=2008-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epoxy-Coated===
[[Epoxy]]-coated barrier cable is used on occasion for aesthetic purposes.  It is significantly more expensive than galvanized barrier cable.

===Plastic-Coated===
[[Plastic]]-Coated is similar to the steel tendon used in [[Unbonded post-tensioned concrete]].  The only difference is that plastic-coated barrier cable does not have a layer of Post Tension coating ("grease") between the [[extruded]] [[HDPE]] plastic sheathing and the steel strand.

==Anchorage==
Depending on parking structure, the barrier cable is installed in rows of several cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsiamerica.com/references/domestic-buildings/barrier-cable-for-parking-structures-ca-usa.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203132916/http://www.dsiamerica.com/references/domestic-buildings/barrier-cable-for-parking-structures-ca-usa.html |archivedate=2008-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several anchorage and attachment systems to concrete or steel columns.

==Specification==
The design and installation of the barrier cable system is referenced in the [[Post-Tensioning Institute]]'s ''Specification for Seven-Wire Steel Strand Barrier Cable Application''s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://post-tensioning.org/product/x_yITPk3lGcmgY2lkPT/Specifications |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727182954/http://post-tensioning.org/product/x_yITPk3lGcmgY2lkPT/Specifications |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
7-wire Barrier Cable has a high strength-to-weight ratio of the strands and the cables cost less to place than precast panels, traditional cast-in-place or concrete masonry barriers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vsl.net/SYSTEMSPRODUCTS/BARRIERCABLE/tabid/92/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bijankhan corpus''' ('''پیکرهٔ بی‌جن‌خان''' in Persian) is a tagged [[Text corpus|corpus]] that is suitable for natural language processing research on the [[Persian language]]. This collection is gathered from daily news and common texts. In this collection all documents are categorized into different subjects such as political, cultural, etc.; in about 4300 different subject categories. The corpus contains about 2.6 million manually tagged words with a tag set that contains 550 Persian [[Part-of-speech tagging|part-of-speech tags]].

The Bijankhan corpus was created by the [[Database Research Group]] at the [[University of Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dbrg.ut.ac.ir/ Database Research Group]&lt;/ref&gt; The corpus is non-[[free content|free]] in that it is not free for commercial use, although these restrictions [[Iran and copyright issues|vary by country]].  The Bijankhan corpus is named after [[Mahmood Bijankhan]], professor of linguistics at the University of Tehran due to his contributions in this area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9384">'''Contextual image classification''', a topic of [[pattern recognition]] in [[computer vision]], is an approach of [[Classification in machine learning|classification]] based on contextual information in images. "Contextual" means this approach is focusing on the relationship of the nearby pixels, which is also called neighbourhood. The goal of this approach is to classify the images by using the contextual information.

== Introduction ==
Similar as [[Natural language processing|processing language]], a single word may have multiple meanings unless the context is provided, and the patterns within the sentences are the only informative segments we care about. For images, the principle is same. Find out the patterns and associate proper meanings to them.

As the image illustrated below, if only a small portion of the image is shown, it is very difficult to tell what the image is about.
[[File:01 mouth.png|center|Mouth]]

Even try another portion of the image, it is still difficult to classify the image.
[[File:02 left eye.png|center|Left eye]]

However, if we increase the contextual of the image, then it makes more sense to recognize.
[[File:03 increased image of smiling face.png|center|thumb|Increased field of smiling face]]

As the full images shows below, almost everyone can classify it easily.
[[File:Full image.png|center|thumb|Full image]]

During the procedure of [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]], the methods which do not use the contextual information are sensitive to noise and variations, thus the result of segmentation will contain a great deal of misclassified regions, and often these regions are small (e.g., one pixel).

Compared to other techniques, this approach is robust to noise and substantial variations for it takes the continuity of the segments into account.

Several methods of this approach will be described below.

== Applications ==

=== Functioning as a post-processing filter to a labelled image ===
This approach is very effective against small regions caused by noise. And these small regions are usually formed by few pixels or one pixel. The most probable label is assigned to these regions.
However, there is a drawback of this method. The small regions also can be formed by correct regions rather than noise, and in this case the method is actually making the classification worse.
This approach is widely used in [[remote sensing]] applications.

=== Improving the post-processing classification ===
This is a two-stage classification process:
# For each pixel, label the pixel and form a new feature vector for it.
# Use the new feature vector and combine the contextual information to assign the final label to the

=== Merging the pixels in earlier stages ===
Instead of using single pixels, the neighbour pixels can be merged into homogeneous regions benefiting from contextual information. And provide these regions to classifier.

=== Acquiring pixel feature from neighbourhood ===
The original spectral data can be enriched by adding the contextual information carried by the neighbour pixels, or even replaced in some occasions. This kind of pre-processing methods are widely used in [[Image texture|textured image]] recognition. The typical approaches include mean values, variances, texture description, etc.

=== Combining spectral and spatial information ===
The classifier uses the grey level and pixel neighbourhood (contextual information) to assign labels to pixels. In such case the information is a combination of spectral and spatial information.

=== Powered by the Bayes minimum error classifier ===
Contextual classification of image data is based on the Bayes minimum error classifier (also known as a [[naive Bayes classifier]]).

'''Present the pixel''':
*A pixel is denoted as &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.
*The neighbourhood of each pixel &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is a vector and denoted as &lt;math&gt;N(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.
**The values in the neighbourhood vector is denoted as &lt;math&gt;f(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;.
**Each pixel is presented by the vector
:::&lt;math&gt;\xi = \left ( f(x_0), f(x_1), \ldots, f(x_k) \right )&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;x_i \in N(x_0); \quad i = 1, \ldots, k&lt;/math&gt;

*The labels (classification) of pixels in the neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;N(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; are presented as a vector
::&lt;math&gt;\eta = \left ( \theta_0, \theta_1, \ldots, \theta_k \right )&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\theta_i \in \left \{ \omega_0, \omega_1, \ldots, \omega_k \right \}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\omega_s&lt;/math&gt; here denotes the assigned class.

*A vector presents the labels in the neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;N(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; without the pixel &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\hat \eta = \left ( \theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_k \right )&lt;/math&gt;

'''The neighbourhood''':
Size of the neighbourhood. There is no limitation of the size, but it is considered to be relatively small for each pixel &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.
A reasonable size of neighbourhood would be &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; of 4-[[Connectedness|connectivity]] or 8-connectivity (&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is marked as red and placed in the centre).
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Square_4_connectivity.svg|[[4-connected graph|4-connectivity]] neighbourhood,&amp;nbsp;
Image:Square_8_connectivity.svg|[[8-connectivity]] neighbourhood
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''The calculation''':

Apply the minimum error classification on a pixel &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, if the probability of a class &lt;math&gt;\omega_r&lt;/math&gt; being presenting the pixel &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is the highest among all, then assign &lt;math&gt;\omega_r&lt;/math&gt; as its class.

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_0 = \omega_r \quad\text{ if }\quad P(\omega_r\mid f(x_0)) = \max_{s=1,2,\ldots,R} P(\omega_s\mid f(x_0)) &lt;/math&gt;

The contextual classification rule is described as below, it uses the feature vector &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_0 = \omega_r \quad\text{ if }\quad P(\omega_r\mid\xi) = \max_{s=1,2,\ldots,R} P(\omega_s\mid\xi) &lt;/math&gt;

Use the Bayes formula to calculate the posteriori probability  &lt;math&gt;P(\omega_s\mid\xi)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;P(\omega_s\mid\xi) = \frac{p(\xi\mid\omega_s)P(\omega_s)}{p \left ( \xi \right )}&lt;/math&gt;

The number of vectors is the same as the number of pixels in the image. For the classifier uses a vector corresponding to each pixel &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the vector is generated from the pixel's neighbourhood.

'''The basic steps of contextual image classification''':
#Calculate the feature vector &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; for each pixel.
#Calculate the parameters of probability distribution &lt;math&gt;p ( \xi\mid\omega_s )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P ( \omega_s )&lt;/math&gt;
#Calculate the posterior probabilities &lt;math&gt;P(\omega_r\mid\xi)&lt;/math&gt; and all labels &lt;math&gt;\theta_0&lt;/math&gt;. Get the image classification result.

== Algorithms ==

=== Template matching ===
The [[template matching]] is a "brute force" implementation of this approach.&lt;ref&gt;G.T. Toussaint, "The Use of Context in Pattern Recognition," Pattern Recognition, vol. 10, 1977,  pp. 189–204.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is first create a set of templates, and then look for small parts in the image match with a template.

This method is computationally high and inefficient. It keeps an entire templates list during the whole process and the number of combinations is extremely high. For a &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; pixel image, there could be a maximum of &lt;math&gt;2^{m \times n}&lt;/math&gt; combinations, which leads to high computation. This method is a top down method and often called [[Lookup table|table look-up]] or [[Data dictionary|dictionary look-up]].

=== Lower-order Markov chain ===

The [[Markov chain]]&lt;ref&gt;K. Abend, T.J. Harley, and L.N. Kanal, "Classification of Binary Random Patterns," IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 11, no. 4, October 1965, pp. 538–544.&lt;/ref&gt; also can be applied in pattern recognition. The pixels in an image can be recognised as a set of random variables, then use the lower order Markov chain to find the relationship among the pixels. The image is treated as a virtual line, and the method uses conditional probability.

=== Hilbert space-filling curves ===

The [[Hilbert curve]] runs in a unique pattern through the whole image, it traverses every pixel without visiting any of them twice and keeps a continuous curve. It is fast and efficient.

=== Markov meshes ===

The lower-order Markov chain and Hilbert space-filling curves mentioned above are treating the image as a line structure. The Markov meshes however will take the two dimensional information into account.

=== Dependency tree ===

The [[Chow–Liu tree|dependency tree]]&lt;ref&gt;C.K. Chow and C.N. Liu, "Approximating Discrete Probability Distributions with Dependence Trees," IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol.14, no. 3, May 1965, pp. 462–467.&lt;/ref&gt; is a method using tree dependency to approximate probability distributions.

The '''Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women''' ('''CEDAW''') is an international treaty adopted in 1979 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].
Described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women, it was instituted on 3 September 1981 and has been ratified by 189 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|author=|date=|website=un.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906035454/https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|archivedate=6 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over fifty countries that have ratified the Convention have done so subject to certain declarations, reservations, and objections, including 38 countries who rejected the enforcement article 29, which addresses means of settlement for disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/reservations-country.htm |title=Declarations, Reservations and Objections to CEDAW |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222104936/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/reservations-country.htm |archivedate=22 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's declaration noted the limitations on central government power resulting from its federal constitutional system. The [[United States]] and [[Palau]] have signed, but not ratified the treaty. The [[Holy See]], [[Iran]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], and [[Tonga]] are not signatories to CEDAW.

=== Core Provisions ===
'''Article 1''' defines [[Sexism|discrimination against women]] in the following terms:&lt;blockquote&gt;Any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and [[Women's rights|women]], of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;'''Article 2''' mandates that states parties ratifying the Convention declare intent to enshrine [[gender equality]] into their domestic legislation, repeal all discriminatory provisions in their laws, and enact new provisions to guard against discrimination against women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; States ratifying the Convention must also establish tribunals and public institutions to guarantee women effective protection against discrimination, and take steps to eliminate all forms of discrimination practiced against women by individuals, organizations, and enterprises.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Article 3''' requires states parties to guarantee basic human rights and fundamental freedoms to women "on a basis of equality with men" through the "political, social, economic, and cultural fields."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Article 4''' notes that "[a]doption...of special measures aimed at accelerating [[de facto]] equality between men and women shall not be considered discrimination." It adds that special protection for [[maternity]] is not regarded as gender discrimination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Article 5''' requires states parties to take measures to seek to eliminate prejudices and customs based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of one sex or on [[stereotype]]d [[gender role|role for men and women]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It also mandates the states parties "[t]o ensure...the recognition of the common responsibility of men and women in the upbringing and development of their children."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Article 6''' obliges states parties to "take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of [[trafficking in women]] and [[Forced prostitution|exploitation of prostitution]] of women."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Article 7''' guarantees women equality in political and public life with a focus on equality in [[Suffrage|voting]], participation in government, and participation in "non-governmental organizations and associations concerned with the public and political life of the country."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Article 8''' provides that states parties will guarantee women's equal "opportunity to represent their Government at the international level and to participate in the work of [[international organizations]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Article 9''' mandates state parties to "grant women equal rights with men to acquire, change or retain their [[nationality]]" and equal rights "with respect to the nationality of their children."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==CEDAW with UNSCR 1325 and 1820==
[[File:Map5.1Discrepant Behavior compressed.jpg|right|400px|thumb| A world map showing countries by CEDAW enforcement, 2010.]]
'''Resolutions 1325 10th anniversary events highlight use of CEDAW mechanisms&lt;ref name="gnwp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnwp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Cedaw-1325-1820-synergy2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501140626/http://www.gnwp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Cedaw-1325-1820-synergy2.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-01 |title=Ensuring Accountability to UNSCR 1325 and 1820 using CEDAW reporting mechanisms |date=November 2010 |website=gnwp.org |publisher=Global Network of Women Peacebuilders |accessdate=5 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

The 10th anniversary of Resolution 1325 in October 2010 highlighted the increasing demand for accountability to UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. Many expressed concern about the fact that only 22 Member States out of 192 have adopted national action plans. Women are still underrepresented, if not totally absent, in most official peace negotiations and sexual violence in peacetime and in conflict continue to increase.

These realities emphasized the need to use external legal mechanisms to strengthen the implementation of SCR 1325, particularly CEDAW. The well-established mechanisms of CEDAW – the Member States compliance report and the civil society shadow reporting process were cited as possible instruments to ensure accountability.

Several regional and international meetings including the High Level Seminar "1325 in 2020: Looking Forward…Looking Back," organized by the African Center for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes, and the "Stockholm International Conference 10 years with 1325 – What now?" called for the use of CEDAW to improve 1325 implementation.

While CEDAW and UN Security Council Resolutions 1325 and 1820 on Women, Peace and Security are important international instruments on their own, there is also an intersection among the three standards that can be used to enhance their implementation and impact.

Resolutions 1325 and 1820 broaden the scope of CEDAW application by clarifying its relevance to all parties in conflict, whereas CEDAW provides concrete strategic guidance for actions to be taken on the broad commitments outlined in the two Resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=UNIFEM |title=CEDAW and Security Council Resolution 1325: A Quick Guide |url=http://www.unrol.org/files/CEDAWandUNSCR1325_eng.pdf |journal=Women, Peace &amp; Security |location= |publisher= |date=2006 |accessdate=25 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120303/http://www.unrol.org/files/CEDAWandUNSCR1325_eng.pdf |archivedate=26 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEDAW is a global human rights treaty that should be incorporated into national law as the highest standard for women's rights. It requires the UN Member States that have ratified it (185 to date) to set in place mechanisms to fully realize [[women's rights]].

Resolution 1325 is an international law unanimously adopted by the Security Council that mandates the UN Member States to engage women in all aspects of peacebuilding including ensuring women's participation on all levels of decision–making on peace and security issues.

Resolution 1820 links sexual violence as a tactic of war with the maintenance of international peace and security. It also demands a comprehensive report from the UN Secretary-General on implementation and strategies for improving information flow to the Security Council; and the adoption of concrete protection and prevention measures to end sexual violence.

Resolutions 1325 and 1820, and CEDAW share the following agenda on women's human rights and [[gender equality]]:&lt;ref name="gnwp" /&gt;

# Demand women’s participation in [[decision-making]] at all levels
# Rejection of violence against women as it impedes the advancement of women and maintains their subordinate status
# Equality of women and men under the law; protection of women and girls through the [[rule of law]]
# Demand security forces and systems to protect women and girls from [[gender-based violence]]
# Recognition of the fact that distinct experiences and burdens of women and girls come from systemic discrimination
# Ensure that women’s experiences, needs and perspectives are incorporated into the political, legal and social decisions that determine the achievement of just and lasting peace

A General Comment from the CEDAW committee could strengthen women’s advocacy for the full implementation of Resolutions 1325 and 1820 at the country and community levels. Conversely, CEDAW’s relevance to conflict-affected areas will be underscored further by the two Resolutions.  In other words, all three international instruments will reinforce each other and be much more effective if used together in leveraging women’s human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnwp.org/what-we-do/local-legislative-advocacy/cedaw-with-unscr-1325-and-1820 CEDAW with UNSCR 1325 and 1820 « Global Network of Women Peacebuilders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130414214651/http://www.gnwp.org/what-we-do/local-legislative-advocacy/cedaw-with-unscr-1325-and-1820 |date=14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members and ratification==
{{Main|List of parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women}}
The six UN member states that have not ratified or acceded to the convention are [[Iran]], [[Palau]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Tonga]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title='Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women' |publisher=Treaties.un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823144158/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=23 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reservations ==
Many [[Reservation (law)|reservations]] have been entered against certain articles of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Reservations to CEDAW: An Analysis for UNICEF |url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Reservations_to_CEDAW-an_Analysis_for_UNICEF.pdf |website=www.unicef.org |accessdate=2015-05-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004104944/http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Reservations_to_CEDAW-an_Analysis_for_UNICEF.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some reservations that are not specific to an article within the Convention but rather a general reservation to all aspects of the Convention that would violate a stated principle. For example, [[Mauritania]] made a reservation stating it approved the Convention "in each and every one of its parts which are not contrary to [[Sharia|Islamic Sharia]]."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A number these reservations, especially those entered by Islamic states parties, are subject to much debate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Human Rights |last=Henkin |first=Louis |publisher=Foundation Press |year=2009 |isbn= |location= |pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 28 of the Convention states that "a [[Reservation (law)|reservation]] incompatible with the object and purpose of the present Convention shall not be permitted."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, many states parties have entered objections to the reservations of other states parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Human rights |last=Henkin |first=Louis |publisher=Foundation Press |year=2009 |isbn= |location= |pages=822}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, many Nordic states parties were concerned that some of the reservations were "undermining the integrity of the text."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |url= |title=The Vienna Convention Reservations Regime and the Convention on the Discrimination Against Women |last=Clark |first=Belinda |date=1991 |journal=The American Journal of International Law |doi= |pmid= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, some states parties have withdrawn their reservations.

As of May 2015, sixty-two states parties have entered reservations against some part of the Convention.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=Declarations and Reservations |date=2015 |accessdate= |website=United Nations Treaty Collection |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906035454/https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=6 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four states parties have entered objections to at least one of these reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The most reserved article is Article 29, concerning dispute resolution and interpretation of the Convention, with thirty-nine reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Because reservations to Article 29 are expressly allowed by the Convention itself, these reservations were not very controversial.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Article 16, concerning the equality of women in marriage and family life is subject to twenty-three reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Committee, in General Recommendation No. 28, specifically stated that reservations to Article 2, concerning general non-discrimination, are impermissible.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, Article 2 has seventeen reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women==
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women is the United Nations (U.N.) treaty body that oversees the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The formation of this committee was outlined in [https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article17 Article 17] of the CEDAW, which also established the rules, purpose, and operating procedures of the committee.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web |last=U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights |title=Fact Sheet No. 22, Discrimination Against Women: The Convention and the Committee |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/47947740d.html |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its years of operation the committee has held multiple sessions to ensure the rules outlined in the CEDAW are being followed. Over time the practices of the committee have evolved due to an increased focus on [[women's rights]] issues.

===History of the committee===
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women was formed on 3 September 1981 after the CEDAW received the 20 [[ratification]]s required for it to enter into force. Article 17 of the CEDAW established the committee in order to ensure that the provisions of the CEDAW were followed by the countries that had signed and agreed to be bound by it.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; The first regular session of the committee was held from 18–22 October 1982. In this session the first officers of the committee were elected by simple majority, with Ms. L. Ider of [[Mongolia]] becoming chairperson.&lt;ref name="The Work Of CEDAW"&gt;{{cite book |last=United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women |title=The Work of CEDAW: Reports of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against  Women |year=1989 |publisher=United Nations |location=New York |isbn=9211301327 |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other officers elected were three vice-chairpersons: M.&amp;nbsp;Caron of Canada, Z.&amp;nbsp;Ilic of [[Yugoslavia]] and L.&amp;nbsp;Mukayiranga of [[Rwanda]]. The final officer elected was D.&amp;nbsp;P. Bernard of [[Guyana]] as [[rapporteur]] of the committee. During this session, the committee also unanimously approved to adopt its [[rules of procedure]].&lt;ref name="The Work Of CEDAW" /&gt;

===Reports===
Under [https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article18 article 18] of the CEDAW states must report to the committee on the progress they have made in implementing the CEDAW within their state.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; As most of the information the committee works with comes from these reports, guidelines have been developed to help states prepare accurate and useful reports.&lt;ref name=Methods&gt;{{cite web |last=United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women |title=Overview of the current working methods of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/wk-methods/Overview-English.pdf |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=18 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022084310/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/wk-methods/Overview-English.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reports discussing the current picture of discrimination against women in the reporting states are required to specifically deal with each article of the CEDAW, and consist of no more than one-hundred pages.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; States are required to prepare and present these initial reports within one year of ratifying the CEDAW.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; Periodic reports detailing the state's progress in adhering to the articles of the CEDAW should be no more than seventy-five pages in length and should focus on the specific period of time since the state's last report.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; States party to the CEDAW are typically required to provide periodic reports every four years, but if the committee is concerned about the situation in that state they can request a report at any time.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

The committee chooses which reports addressing by considering factors such as the amount of time the report has been pending, whether the report is initial or periodic (with more priority given to initial reports), and from which region the report originates.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; Eight states are invited to give their reports during each session and it is required a representative from the state is in attendance when the report is presented.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The committee focuses on constructive dialogue when a report is presented and appreciates careful time management on the part of the state presenting its report.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; Due to the high backlog of overdue reports the committee has encouraged states to combine all of their outstanding reports into one document and sends reminders to states who have reports that are five years overdue.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The CEDAW also requires that the committee provide an annual report that includes its activities, comments relating to the reports provided by states, information relating to the Optional Protocol of the CEDAW, and any other general suggestions or recommendations the committee has made.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; This report is given to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] through the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; All reports, agendas and other official documents pertaining to the committee, including the reports provided by the states, are provided to the public unless otherwise decided by the committee.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt;

===General Recommendations===

Along with issuing its annual report and offering advice to reporting states, the committee has the ability to issue general recommendations that elaborate on its views of the obligations imposed by CEDAW.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; To date, the committee has issued thirty-two general recommendations, the latest dealing with the gender related dimensions of refugee status, asylum, nationality and statelessness of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |title=General recommendation No. 32 on the gender-related dimensions of refugee status, asylum, nationality and statelessness of women |url=https://undocs.org/CEDAW/C/GC/32 |website=undocs.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=21 March 2017 |date=14 November 2014 |id=CEDAW/C/GC/32 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322014914/http://undocs.org/CEDAW/C/GC/32 |archivedate=22 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendations issued by the committee in its first decade were short and dealt mainly with the content of states’ reports and reservations to the convention.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; Since 1991, however, recommendations have been focused on guiding states’ application of the CEDAW in specific situations.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; The formulation of a general recommendation begins with dialogue between the committee on the topic in the recommendation with various non-governmental organizations and other U.N. bodies.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; The recommendation is then drafted by a member of the committee and discussed and revised in the next session, and finally adopted in the following session.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt;

Currently the Committee is working on the '''General Recommendation''' Trafficking in women and girls in the context of global migration.

===Changes in the committee===

For the first ten years the committee operated significantly differently from now. The only form of [[censure]] given to the committee by the CEDAW was their general recommendations and concluding comments following a report.&lt;ref name=Reilly&gt;{{cite book |last=Reilly |first=Niamh |title=Women's human rights : seeking gender justice in a globalizing age |year=2009 |publisher=[[Polity Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780745637006 |pages=62 |edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the emergence of the Global Campaign for Women's Human Rights in 1991 more attention was given to the CEDAW, reviving the committee.&lt;ref name=Reilly /&gt; The committee made changes to the CEDAW that allowed it to meet more than once a year, and have taken advantage of this by meeting at least twice a year since 1997.&lt;ref name=Reilly /&gt; The committee originally only met for two weeks in its annual sessions, but that has now been changed to meeting multiple times a year in eighteen-day sessions.&lt;ref name=Report /&gt; CEDAW also gained new complaint and inquiry proceedings allowing the committee to initiate inquiry proceedings if it believes a state is in severe violation of the articles of the CEDAW.&lt;ref name=Reilly /&gt;

===Recommendations for improvement===
Despite evolving since the committee was first formed, members believe there are ways in which the committee can better meet the goals outlined in the CEDAW.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; One of the committee's main goals moving forward is expanding its information base, allowing it to more effectively deal with issues that arise concerning the CEDAW.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; The committee is authorized in [https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article22 Article 22] of the CEDAW to invite specialized U.N. agencies such as the [[United Nations Development Programme]] to deliver reports discussing women's rights issues in the state under discussion.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; Another method for gathering information is requesting reports from non-governmental organizations dealing with discrimination against women that are operating in the country under discussion.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; This is recommended to insure that the committee is receiving the full, unbiased picture of affairs within the reporting state.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

Another recommendation for improvement involves interpreting and clarifying the language used in the CEDAW in order to make the document as useful as it can be.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; A third improvement that has been suggested is improving the efficiency of the committee.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; Due to the backlog in reports faced by the committee it has been suggested that the government officials who prepare reports presented to the committee should be trained, in order to make all reports uniform and more easily processed.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; A final suggestion for improvement is the implementation of a right of petition in the CEDAW, allowing the committee to hear complaints from citizens of a state against the state, increasing the committee's strength and direct impact on the problem of discrimination against women.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

===Languages===
The official languages of the committee are [[English language|English]], [[Arabic]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], with any statement made in one of the official languages translated into the other four.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; A speaker who does not speak one of the official languages provides a translator.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; All formal decisions and documents issued by the committee are provided in each of the official languages.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The original rules of procedure adopted by the committee did not include Arabic as an official language, but the rule was amended in the committees second session to include Arabic.&lt;ref name="The Work Of CEDAW" /&gt;

===Members and Officers of the Committee===
Twenty-three members serve on the committee, described as experts for their experience and expertise in women's issues.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Merry |first=Sally Engle |title=Human rights and gender violence : translating international law into local justice |year=2006 |publisher=[[Univ. of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago [u.a.] |isbn=0226520730 |pages=82 |edition=[Nachdr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members are nominated by their national governments and elected through a secret ballot by states party to the convention.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Upon winning the election and taking up their responsibilities the members of the committee recite the following statement, known as the solemn declaration, "I solemnly declare that I shall perform my duties and exercise powers as a member of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women honourably, faithfully, impartially and conscientiously".&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The members come from a wide range of occupations including doctors, lawyers, diplomats and educators, providing various viewpoints to the committee due to their diversity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Many members continue to hold full-time jobs outside the committee and receive little monetary payment for their work on the committee.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

To insure that the nationality of members encompasses all the diverse states who have signed the CEDAW, members are elected according to regions divided into [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The members of the committee differ from those of other treaty bodies of the United Nations in that they have all been women with only one exception.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; In the event a member of the committee is unable to continue serving on the committee before her term is up the state that had nominated the resigning member shall nominate another expert from their country to fill in her seat.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; Committee members and experts also attend an annual luncheon, hosted by the [[NGO Committee on the Status of Women, New York|NGO Committee on the Status of Women, NY]] (NGO CSW/NY), where key issues are discusses and the efforts of the committee are honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngocsw.org/about/how-we-work |title=NGO CSW, NY / About / How We Work |publisher=Ngocsw.org |date=26 July 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011010921/http://www.ngocsw.org/about/how-we-work |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the chairperson fails to designate a vice-chairperson prior to her absence then the vice-chairperson with the first name in English alphabetical order takes over.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; In the event an officer is unable to continue serving on the committee before her term expires a new officer from the same region as the original officer shall be nominated, elected and will take over the vacated office.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt;

==Optional Protocol==
The [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] is a side-agreement to the Convention which allows its parties to recognise the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women to consider complaints from individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cedawopprot-2000.html Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509170959/http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cedawopprot-2000.html |date=9 May 2008 }}, Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Optional Protocol was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 6 October 1999 and entered into force on 22 December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/wom1242.htm |title=Optional Protocol to Women's Convention Comes into Force |date=21 December 2000 |accessdate=2008-07-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907212930/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/wom1242.htm |archivedate=7 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it has 80 signatories and 109 parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8-b&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=Parties to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women |publisher=UN OHCHR |accessdate=2009-10-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520040105/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8-b&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=20 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Controversy around CEDAW comes from two opposite directions: social and religious [[conservative]]s which claim that CEDAW is seeking to impose a [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[Progressivism|progressive]], [[Feminism|feminist]] standard on countries, in detriment of [[traditional values]]; and [[radical feminists]], who are skeptical of the power, or even desire, of CEDAW to radically transform societies and truly liberate women, and claim that CEDAW adheres to a form of weak [[liberal feminism]] similar to other mainstream organizations.&lt;ref&gt;https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/10/2/512/666068/Gender-and-democratic-citizenship-the-impact-of&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=iclc_papers |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511154106/http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=iclc_papers |archivedate=11 May 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://femequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-Does-the-CEDAW-Address-the-Problem-of-Culture-and-Tradition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810015119/http://femequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-Does-the-CEDAW-Address-the-Problem-of-Culture-and-Tradition.pdf |archivedate=10 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Synthesis|article|date=October 2016}}
{{Physical cosmology|comp/struct}}

In [[astronomy]] and [[cosmology]], '''dark fluid''' is an alternative theory to both [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] and attempts to explain both phenomena in a single framework.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Arbey (2005) "Is it possible to consider Dark Energy and Dark Matter as a same and unique Dark Fluid? https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0506732"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arbey2006&gt;Alexandre Arbey (2006) "Dark Fluid: a complex scalar field to unify dark energy and dark matter https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0601274"&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=October 2016}}

Dark fluid proposes that dark matter and dark energy are not separate physical phenomena as previously thought, nor do they have separate origins, but that they are strongly linked together and can be considered as two facets of a single fluid. At galactic scales, the dark fluid behaves like dark matter, and at larger scales its behavior becomes similar to dark energy. Our observations within the scales of the [[Earth]] and the [[Solar System]] are currently insufficient to explain the gravitational effects observed at such larger scales.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Overview ==
Two major conundrums have arisen in [[astrophysics]] and [[cosmology]] in recent times, both dealing with the laws of [[Gravitation|gravity]]. The first was the realization that there aren't enough visible stars or gas inside [[Galaxy|galaxies]] to account for their high rate of [[Galaxy rotation curve|rotation]]. The theory of [[dark matter]] was created to explain this phenomenon. It theorizes that the galaxies are spinning as fast as they are because there is more matter in those galaxies (including our own [[Milky Way]]) than can be seen by counting the mass of stars and gas alone, and that this unseen (dark) matter is invisible because it doesn't interact with the [[electromagnetic force]] from which all forms of light come.

The second conundrum came from the observations of a very specific kind of [[supernova]], known as a [[Type Ia supernova]] used as a [[standard candle]]: when they were compared in distant vs. nearby galaxies, it was found that the distant supernova were fainter, and thus farther away than expected. This implied that the [[Universe]] was not only expanding, but [[accelerating universe|accelerating its expansion]]. The theory of [[dark energy]] was created to explain this phenomenon.

The traditional approach to modeling the effects of gravity assumes that [[general relativity]] is as valid at cosmological scales as it is in the Solar System, where its predictions have been more accurately tested. Not changing the rules of gravity, however, implies the presence of dark matter and dark energy in parts of the Universe where the curvature of the [[space-time]] [[manifold]] is far less than that in the Solar System. It is phenomenologically possible to alter the equations of gravity in regions of low space-time curvature such that the dynamics of the space-time causes what we assign to the presence of dark matter and dark energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Exirifard | first=Q. | year=2010 | title=Phenomenological covariant approach to gravity | journal=General Relativity and Gravitation | doi=10.1007/s10714-010-1073-6 | bibcode = 2011GReGr..43...93E | volume=43 | pages=93–106 | arxiv = 0808.1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dark fluid theory hypothesizes that the dark fluid is a specific kind of fluid whose attractive and repulsive behaviors depend on the local energy density. In this theory, the dark fluid behaves like dark matter in the regions of space where the baryon density is high. The idea is that when the dark fluid is in the presence of matter, it slows down and coagulates around it; this then attracts more dark fluid to coagulate around it, thus amplifying the force of gravity near it. The effect is always present, but only becomes noticeable in the presence of a very large mass such as a galaxy. This description is similar to theories of dark matter, and a special case of the equations of dark fluid reproduces dark matter.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

On the other hand, in places where there is relatively little matter, as in the [[Void (astronomy)|voids]] between galactic [[superclusters]], this theory predicts that the dark fluid relaxes and acquires a negative pressure. Thus dark fluid becomes a repulsive force, with an effect similar to that of dark energy.

Dark fluid goes beyond dark matter and dark energy in that it predicts a continuous range of attractive and repulsive qualities under various matter density cases. Indeed, special cases of various other gravitational theories are reproduced by dark fluid, e.g. [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]], [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], [[Quintessence (physics)#Phantom energy|k-essence]], [[f(R) gravity|f(R)]], [[Einstein aether theory|Generalized Einstein-Aether f(K)]], [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]], [[TeVeS]], [[Bi-scalar tensor vector gravity|BSTV]], etc. Dark fluid theory also suggests new models, such as a certain f(K+R) model that suggests interesting corrections to MOND that depend on redshift and density.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Simplifying assumptions ==
Dark fluid theory is not treated like a standard [[fluid mechanics]] model, because many of the fluid mechanics equations are too difficult to solve completely. A formalized fluid mechanical approach, like the [[Chaplygin gas|generalized Chaplygin gas model]], would be an ideal method for modeling this theory, but it currently requires too many observational data points to be computationally feasible, and not enough such data points are available to cosmologists yet. A simplification step was undertaken by modeling the theory through scalar field models instead, as is done in other alternative approaches to dark energy and dark matter.&lt;ref name=Arbey2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arbey | first1 = A. | last2 = Mahmoudi | first2 = F. | year = 2007 | title = One-loop quantum corrections to cosmological scalar field potentials | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.75.063513 | journal = Physical Review D| volume =  75| issue = | page =  |arxiv = hep-th/0703053 |bibcode = 2007PhRvD..75f3513A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personalized medicine]] involves [[Medicine|medical treatments]] based on the characteristics of individual patients, including their [[medical history]], [[family history]], and [[genetics]]. Although personal genetic information is becoming increasingly important in healthcare, there is a lack of sufficient education in [[medical genetics]] among physicians and the general public.&lt;ref name="Lamb2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lamb | first1 = N.

==Training==
As of 2009, the majority of primary care physicians did not have adequate training in genetics or [[genomics]].&lt;ref name="Salari2009"/&gt; Although medical school curricula typically include medical genetics, fewer than half offer a standalone course, and the emphasis on practical applications is weak.&lt;ref name="Lamb2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salari2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thurston2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thurston | first1 = V.

In the United States, [[Stanford University]] was the first medical school in the United States to offer a course teaching the interpretation of genetic data.&lt;ref name="Roethel2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stanford genotype class asks: What's your type? |author=Kathryn Roethel |url=http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Stanford-genotype-class-asks-What-s-your-type-3258926.php |newspaper=SFGate |date=July 12, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students were able to study their own [[genotype]]s, determined using commercially available [[Personal genomics|genotyping platforms]] ([[23andMe]] or [[Navigenics]]).&lt;ref name="Jabr2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=Exposing the Student Body: Stanford Joins U.C.

==Personal genotyping and education==
In 2010, the [[University of California, Berkeley]] offered entering students a genetic test for [[single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] affecting alcohol, lactose, and folate metabolism.&lt;ref name="Nature2010"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A DNA education |author= |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7300/full/465845b.html |newspaper=Nature |date=June 16, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013 |volume=465 |issue=7300 |doi=10.1038/465845b |pages=845–846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=College bound, DNA swab in hand |author=Tamar Lewin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/education/19dna.html|newspaper=Nature |date=May 18, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was “to spark discussion during orientation on how genetic testing works, the results of the students' tests and their decisions on whether or not to participate.”&lt;ref name="Jabr2010"/&gt; However, criticism of the program led to an informational hearing by the California State Committee on Higher Education, and a bill was introduced by [[Chris Norby]] to prevent California state universities from genetically testing their students.&lt;ref name="Gross2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=UC Berkeley DNA testing goes before state committee |author=Rachel Gross |url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2010/08/11/dna-testing-at-u-c-berkeley-goes-before-state-committee/ |newspaper=Berkeleyside |date=August 11, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Genome2010b"&gt;{{cite news |title=California Legislation Seeks to Bar UC Berkeley's Genetic Testing Plans |author= |url=http://www.genomeweb.com/dxpgx/california-legislation-seeks-bar-uc-berkeleys-genetic-testing-plans |newspaper=Genome Web Daily News |date=July 14, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California Department of Public Health concluded that the program constituted clinical testing, and the university released only aggregate information instead of personal results.&lt;ref name="NNB2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=State halts UC Berkeley’s gene testing plans |author=Alla Katsnelson |url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2010/08/state_halts_uc_berkeleys_gene_1.html |newspaper=Nature News Blog |date=August 12, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw2012"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Right Type: Personal Genetic Testing in the Medical School Curriculum |author=Gina Shaw |url=https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/reporter/feb2012/273822/genetic-testing.html |newspaper=AAMC Reporter |date=February 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in the preceding section, in some courses on personalized medicine, students have been able to study their personal genetic information. For the Stanford course, which was designed for graduate and medical students, a review was conducted in 2009-2010 by a “joint genotyping task force” including research and clinical faculty, biomedical ethicists, genetic counselors, and legal counsel.&lt;ref name="Salari2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature2010"/&gt; The recommendations adopted included: making genetic testing optional (with instructors blinded to the choice of the students), strict data confidentiality (only aggregate data was made available during discussions), incorporation of lectures discussing issues related to personal genotyping, and availability of genetic counseling to students if necessary.&lt;ref name="Salari2011"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4986">'''Empty forest''' is a term coined by Kent H. Redford's article "The Empty Forest"  (1992), which was published in ''[[BioScience]]''.  An "empty forest" refers to an [[ecosystem]] that is void of large [[mammal]]s. Empty forests are characterized by an otherwise excellent habitat, and often have large, fully grown trees, although they lack large mammals as a result of human impact. Empty forests show that human impact can destroy an ecosystem from within as well as from without.&lt;ref name="Redford"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Redford|first=Kent|title=The Empty Forest|journal=BioScience|date=June 1992|volume=42|issue=6|pages=412–422|url=http://www.biology.ufl.edu/courses/pcb5356/2011fall/kitajima/Redford1992Biosci.pdf|doi=10.2307/1311860|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111203443/http://www.biology.ufl.edu/courses/pcb5356/2011fall/kitajima/Redford1992Biosci.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the large mammals that are disappearing, such as deer and [[tapir]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Bodmer, R. E. 1989. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00378967 Ungulate biomass in relation to feeding strategy within Amazonian forests]. Oecologia, 81: 547-550.&lt;/ref&gt; are important for seed dispersion. Many tree species that are very localized in their dispersion rely on mammals rather than the wind to disperse their seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, A. H. 1983. Dispersal ecology and diversity in neotropical forest communities. Sonderband Naturwissenschaftlicher Verein Hamburg, 7: 303-314.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, when [[seed predation]] is down, trees with large seeds begin to completely dominate those with small seeds, changing the balance of plant life in an area.&lt;ref&gt;Putz, F. E., E. G. Leigh Jr, S. J. Wright. 1990. Solitary confinement in Panama. Garden, 14: 18-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Predatory large mammals are important for increasing overall diversity by making sure that smaller predators and herbivores do not become overabundant and dominate. An absence of large predators seems to result in uneven densities of prey species.&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, L. H. 1987. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00292180 Comparative feeding ecology of felids in a neotropical rainforest]. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 20: 271-283.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though certain animals may not have become completely extinct, they may have lowered in numbers to the point that they have suffered an [[ecological extinction]]. The animals that have most likely suffered an ecological extinction in neotropical forests are the ones who are the most important predators, large seed dispersers, and seed predators.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, C. H., L. H. Emmons. 1990. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=_iHcFWDskakC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA314&amp;dq=Ecological+structure+of+the+nonflying+mammal+community+at+Cocha+Cashu+biological+station,+Manu+National+Park,+Peru&amp;ots=HQCSWE8Sj7&amp;sig=ZeIsRw7rw-8ErRqCitV5wz0ovcM#v=onepage&amp;q=Ecological%20structure%20of%20the%20nonflying%20mammal%20community%20at%20Cocha%20Cashu%20biological%20station%2C%20Manu%20National%20Park%2C%20Peru&amp;f=false Ecological structure of the nonflying mammal community at Cocha Cashu biological station, Manu National Park, Peru]. Four neotropical rainforests, 314-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[defaunation]] of large mammals can be done by direct or indirect means. Any type of human activity not aimed at the animals in question that results in the defaunation of those animals is indirect. The most common means of indirect defaunation is [[habitat destruction]]. However, other examples of indirect means of defaunation of large mammals would be the over-collection of fruits and nuts or over-hunting of prey that large mammals need for food. Another example of an indirect means of the defaunation of large mammals is through the by-products of modern human activities such as mercury and smoke, or even [[noise pollution]].&lt;ref name="Redford" /&gt;

There are two categories of direct defaunation. They include subsistence hunting and commercial hunting. The most common species of animals hunted are typically the largest species in their area. The large mammals in an area are often represented by only a few species, but make up a major part of the overall [[biomass]]. In areas with only moderate hunting, the biomass of mammalian game species decreases by 80.7%. In areas with heavy hunting, the biomass of mammalian game species can decrease by 93.7%.&lt;ref&gt;Redford, K. H., C. Murcia, B. Klein. 1992.

The '''Forum for Sankaradeva Studies''' (Assamese: ''Sankaradeva Adhyayan Kendra'') is a research-oriented institution  dedicated to promoting the message and the ideals of [[Sankaradeva|Srimanta Sankaradeva]], one of the leading lights of the [[Vaishnavite]] tradition in India. It is based at [[Guwahati]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Assam]], and operates out of its offices located at Keteki Path, Saurabh Nagar, in the [[Beltola]] precinct of [[Guwahati]].

The Forum was formally inaugurated in the year 1988, under the presidency of the eminent scholar Dr. [[Maheswar Neog]]. It has succeeded in producing a steady stream of fine scholarly output since then. The incumbent General Secretary of the Forum is Dr. Pradip Jyoti Mahanta of the department of [[Assamese language|Assamese]], University of Guwahati.&lt;ref name="Sinha2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Biswajit Sinha|title=Folk theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UzEbAQAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Raj Publications|page=143|isbn=978-81-86208-35-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aims and objects of the Forum are:
*to establish a centre for research on the diverse contributions of Sankaradeva and their abiding values;
*to organize and hold lectures, seminars, exhibitions of art, demonstrations of music, dance and drama;
*to encourage and focus standard performances and other products of various art forms of the Sankaradeva tradition;
*to establish a centre for performing and other art forms;
*to establish a reference library particularly equipped with a manuscript section and also a museum of art objects;
*to bring out bulletins, journals and other publications from time to time;
*to organize extension programmes, etc. in different places for the furtherance of the ideals of Sankaradeva.

Thus, The Forum is committed to providing institutional support for research-workers, students, scholars and other sections of the public who are engaged in Sankaradeva studies, as also to creating an atmosphere which conduces, in broad social terms, to the success of such efforts.

'''Gaunilo''' or '''Gaunillon'''{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}} ({{floruit|11th}} century) was a [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] of [[Marmoutier Abbey, Tours|Marmoutier Abbey]] in [[Tours]], [[France]]. He is best known for his contemporary criticism of the [[ontological argument]] for the [[existence of God]] which appeared in [[St&amp;nbsp;Anselm]]'s ''[[Proslogion]]''. In his work ''In Behalf of the Fool'',{{refn|The title of Gaunilo's book repeats Anselm's use of the fool mentioned in the [[Psalms]] who doubts the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 14:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 53:1&lt;/ref&gt;}} Gaunilo contends that St&amp;nbsp;Anselm's ontological argument fails because logic of the same kind would force one to conclude many things exist which certainly do not.&lt;ref&gt;''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion'', Michael J. Murray and Michael Cannon Rea, [[Cambridge University Press]], 2008, pg. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[empiricist]], Gaunilo thought that the human intellect is only able to comprehend information provided by the senses.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Theology: Middle Ages'', Giulio D'Onofrio and Basil Studer, Liturgical Press, 2008, pg. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little beyond this essay is known of Gaunilo; no other extant writings bear his name. Anselm wrote a [[Reply to Gaunilo|reply to it]], essentially arguing that Gaunilo had missed his point.
==The "Lost Island" refutation==
Anselm claimed his ontological argument as proof of the existence of God, whom he described as that being for which no greater can be conceived.  A god that does not exist cannot be that than which no greater can be conceived, as existence would make it greater.  Thus, according to St. Anselm, the concept of God necessarily entails His existence. He denies Gaunilo a Godless [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;''Anselm of Canterbury: The beauty of Theology'', David S. Hogg,
Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, pg. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaunilo [[Ontological argument#Gaunilo|criticised Anselm's argument]] by employing the same reasoning, via ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', to "prove" the existence of the mythical "Lost Island", the greatest or most perfect island: if the island of which we are thinking does not exist, it cannot be the greatest conceivable island, for, to be the greatest conceivable island, it would have to exist, as any existent island would be greater than an imaginary one.  This, of course, is merely a direct application of Anselm's own premise that existence is a perfection.  Since we can conceive of this greatest or most perfect island, it must, by Anselm's way of thinking, exist.  While this argument is absurd, Gaunilo claims that it is [[reductio ad absurdam|no more so]] than Anselm's.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Anselm had no difficulty in rejecting this parody, because Gaunilo had described the Lost Island as "an island more excellent than any other lands".  Anselm correctly pointed out that nowhere had he had put forward the kind of argument which Gaunilo alleged, "because the phrase 'greater than everything' does not have the same force for the purpose of proving that what is spoken of is in reality as [his own phrase] "than which a greater cannot be conceived" &lt;Anselm's Reply V&gt;. Because Gaunilo's phrase did not contain the words "can be conceived", his counter-argument cannot generate the contradiction from which Anselm concludes that something than which a greater cannot be conceived is in reality.   


Philosophers often attempt to prove the [[ontological]] argument wrong by comparing Anselm's with Gaunilo's.  The former runs:  

# God is that being than which no greater can be conceived.
# It is greater to exist in reality than merely as an idea.
# If God does not exist, we can conceive of an even greater being, ''that is'' one that ''does'' exist.
# Therefore, God must indeed exist in reality.

Gaunilo's parody runs along the same lines:

# The Lost Island is that island than which no greater can be conceived.
# It is greater to exist in reality than merely as an idea.
# If the Lost Island does not exist, one can conceive of an even greater island, that is one that does exist.
# Therefore, the Lost Island exists in reality.

If one of these arguments is sound, it has been asserted, they must both be sound.  By Gaunilo's reckoning, however, one (and, therefore, the other, too) is unsound.  The Lost Island does not exist, so there is something wrong with the logic that proves that it does.  Because the argument proves true in one case that which is patently false (the Lost Island), it is fair to ask whether it may fairly be regarded as proving true the other case.  The fact that there is no perfect island is put forth by Gaunilo as showing that Anselm's argument for God's existence is flawed.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Such objections are called overload objections: they do not claim to show where or how the argument goes wrong; they merely argue that, if it is unsound in one application, it is unsound in all others.&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophy of Religion." Gaunilo of MarmoutiersÂ Objection to AnselmÂs Argument. N.p., n.d. Web. 30 Sept. 2012. &lt;http://www.scandalon.co.uk/philosophy/gaunilo.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply put, they are arguments that would overload the world with an indefinitely large number of things, like perfect islands.

==Criticisms==
Gaunilo's objection to the ontological argument has been criticised on several grounds. [[Reply to Gaunilo|Anselm's own reply]] was essentially that Gaunilo had missed his point: any ''other'' being's existence is derived from God's, unnecessary in itself, and nonamenable to his ontological argument which can only ever properly apply to the single greatest being of all beings. Indeed, while we can try and conceive of a perfect island, that island is yet greater if it creates other beings, whereupon it would no longer be an island as we can understand it. Similarly, [[Alvin Plantinga]] tendered a reply to Gaunilo's remonstrance by arguing that the concept of "''that than which nothing greater can be conceived''" is not applicable to an island, or any other object, in the special way that it is applicable to God.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Plantinga defends Anselm's proof by averring that it applies exclusively to Him. A [[necessary being]] is both existent and the greatest conceivable and greatest possible being.  Only God, as Anselm defines him, meets all of those criteria and can, therefore, be dubbed a necessary being.

Another criticism of Gaunilo's argument points out that, whereas God is that ''thing'' than which no greater can be conceived, Gaunilo's is that ''island'' than which no greater can be conceived.  Thus, while no island may exceed it in greatness, it is perfectly reasonable to suppose that some non-island could.  "''Consequently,''" wrote [[William L. Rowe]] in his summary of the polemic, "''if we follow Anselm's reasoning exactly, it does not appear that we can derive an absurdity from the supposition that the island than which none greater is possible does not exist.''"&lt;ref&gt;William L. Rowe: "The Ontological Argument" in Feinberg; Shafer-Landau: ''Reason &amp; Responsibility'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaunilo's refutation is also criticized on the grounds that it misinterprets the argument set forth by Anselm. Richard Campbell contends that the argument criticized by Gaunilo is incomplete because it represents only one of three stages of a larger argument, one that is not meant to be read as a proof for God but rather as the basis for the following chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking Anselm's Arguments: A Vindication of his Proof of the Existence of God|last=Campbell|first=Richard|publisher=Brill|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallels==
David and Marjorie Haight took a very similar tack with Anselm's proof attempt as did Gaunilo.  However, whereas Gaunilo changed the target noun of Anselm's proof, "God", to an alternate noun that he felt was more obviously absurd, a "Lost Island", the Haights inverted the adjective in Anselm's reasoning.  Where Anselm used the word "greater" to define god into existence, the Haights point out that the logic can be inverted by replacing "greater" with "worse".  The statement then follows to a conclusion that the very most bad thing has to be an existent bad thing, because it would be worse for this bad thing to exist than to not exist, therefore it must exist in its absolute badness.  Therefore, the Devil must also exist, so long as Anselm's proof is held as consequential.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Both Gaunilo and the Haights arguments point out that there may be other nouns, and other bivalent adjectives that when conceived as an Anselm proof (in an extreme that demands existence) could also be argued to necessitate their existence as well.  For example, with cold or heat: Surely an absolutely cold (or hot) being that exists in reality is more absolutely cold (or hot) than one that only exists in imagination.  Therefore, it must indeed exist in reality.  And so on.  The Haights show that the word "great" may not be the only adjective that pushes for existence when conceived in the extreme, just as the phrase "that God thing" may not be the only noun interacting with "great" in this way, as Gaunilo observed.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==The remainder of Gaunilo's text==
Gaunilo's treatise is divided into eight sections. The first seven of these sections are criticisms of Anselm's argument from the point of view of a rational non-believer. The last section (8) is simply praise for the remaining chapters of the Proslogion. The full title of Gaunilo's treatise is: 'What Someone in Behalf of the Fool Replies to these Arguments'.&lt;ref&gt;Gaunilo's name does not appear in early manuscripts.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2014}} This means Gaunilo does not write as a fellow Christian who believes, rather, he pretends to be a rational non-believer. The scholarly debate has focused on section 6 (the Lost Island Refutation). Very few scholars&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas Losoncy and recently Miroslav Imbrisevic&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2014}} engage with the remaining sections of Gaunilo's text.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

This demographic rescue may be similar to genetic rescue, as each increase population size and/or fitness. This overlap in meaning has led some researchers to consider a more detailed definition for each type of rescue that details 'assessment and documentation of pre- and post-translocation genetic ancestry'.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Not every example of genetic rescue is clearly successful and the current definition of genetic rescue does not mandate that the process result in a 'successful' outcome. Despite an ambiguous definition, genetic rescue is viewed positively, with many perceived successes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whiteley|first=Andrew R.|last2=Fitzpatrick|first2=Sarah W.|last3=Funk|first3=W.

== History ==
The conceptual foundation of genetic rescue can be traced back to the work of geneticist [[Sewall Wright]], who studied the effect of immigration among populations linked by gene flow.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tallmon|first=David A.|last2=Luikart|first2=Gordon|last3=Waples|first3=Robin S.|date=September 2004|title=The alluring simplicity and complex reality of genetic rescue|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=19|issue=9|pages=489–496|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.07.003|issn=0169-5347|pmid=16701312}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, genetic rescue has been defined by scientific reviews as: “when population fitness, inferred from some demographic vital rate or phenotypic trait, increases by more than can be attributed to the demographic contribution of immigrants.”&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hedrick|first=Philip W.|last2=Adams|first2=Jennifer R.|last3=Vucetich|first3=John A.|date=2011-11-09|title=Reevaluating and Broadening the Definition of Genetic Rescue|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01751.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=25|issue=6|pages=1069–1070|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01751.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TALLMON|first=D|last2=LUIKART|first2=G|last3=WAPLES|first3=R|date=2004-09-01|title=The alluring simplicity and complex reality of genetic rescue|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2004.07.003|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=19|issue=9|pages=489–496|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.07.003|issn=0169-5347|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic mixing leading to fitness recovery could be described as “genetic rescue”, but perpetuates the unclear differences between genetic rescue and pollution.

== Genetic Processes ==

When a species' population becomes too small, they are subject to genetic processes such as [[inbreeding depression]] from a lack of gene flow, allelic fixation from [[genetic drift]], and loss of diversity. In combination these can lead to a decrease in population fitness, and increase the risk of  extinction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Genetic rescue is a conservation tool which tries to address these genetic factors by moving genes from one population to another to increase the overall genetic diversity and minimize inbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://conservationbytes.com/2015/03/12/avoiding-genetic-rescue-not-justified-on-genetic-grounds/#more-16749|title=Avoiding genetic rescue not justified on genetic grounds|date=2015-03-11|work=ConservationBytes.com|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This conservation technique intended to increase the fitness of a small, imperiled population&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; through the introduction of beneficial alleles through migration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is often used for populations of species that are at a high risk of extinction. A successful genetic rescue occurs when the addition of new genes effectively introduces genetic diversity that leads to increased population size and growth rate, as well as a greater population fitness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An unsuccessful genetic rescue may occur if the addition of new genes causes [[outbreeding depression]], which decreases their population fitness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Too much gene flow may lead to genetic swamping through extensive hybridization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Genetic rescue can occur through multiple pathways, including [[heterosis]] and [[Adaptive Evolution|adaptive evolution]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is closely related to, but distinctly different from the concepts of [[genetic pollution]], [[evolutionary rescue]], [[Restoration ecology|genetic restoration]], and assisted gene flow.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Gene Flow ===
{{See also|Gene flow}}
Gene flow (migration) is the introduction of new individuals (and genes) into a target population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_21|title=Gene flow|website=evolution.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predicting the impact of a migrant on a population will depend on combination of complex genetic and non-genetic factors. Whether migration increases population fitness will depend if the genes brought in are adapted to local conditions and if they decrease levels of inbreeding in the target population. An Introduced individuals can also positively or negatively affect genetic rescue through behaviors such as mate choice, dominance hierarchies, and infanticide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Genetic Drift ===
{{See also|Genetic drift}}
Genetic drift is the fixation of [[allele]]s by chance, hence reducing the overall diversity in the population. Genetic rescue can restore diversity by adding new genes to a population, counteracting fixation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_24|title=Genetic drift|website=evolution.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selection and Local Adaptation ===
{{See also|Natural selection|Local adaptation}}
Natural selection occurs when variations in heritable traits determines reproductive success of an individual, and thereby determines the persistence of that trait in that population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/evo_25|title=Natural selection|website=evolution.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic rescue may introduce traits that are advantageous to the target population or reduced the frequency of disadvantageous traits, increasing the net fitness of a population to ensure the continued survival as a species.

== Controversy ==
Genetic rescue can be a controversial tool because it is hard to predict how a population will be affected by a migration event. Genetic rescue has the possibility of actually lowering the fitness of a population by swamping the population or increasing rare deleterious alleles.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hedrick|first=Philip W.|last2=Garcia-Dorado|first2=Aurora|date=December 2016|title=Understanding Inbreeding Depression, Purging, and Genetic Rescue|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=31|issue=12|pages=940–952|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2016.09.005|issn=1872-8383|pmid=27743611}}&lt;/ref&gt; This instance may simply be termed genetic pollution instead of being referred to genetic rescue. Rescue may also only be a short-term solution, as shown by the case of the Isle Royale Wolves. In that case, genetic rescue of the wolves resulted in a large initial increase in population fitness followed by a large decline in subsequent years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many conservationists argue that genetic rescue could create unforeseen problems for species at risk, and that it overlooks the underlying problems that push so many species to the brink of extinction, including habitat loss due to human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/threatened-species-science-genetic-rescue-180963040/|title=Threatened Species?

As with the term genetic pollution, 'genetic rescue' has political connotations. Some of the more controversial  practices which can be considered genetic rescue include

*[[Hybrid (biology)|Hybridization]] that increases the viability of endangered populations suffering from inbreeding and genetic drift or saves [[endling]]s may be considered part of genetic rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baskett|first=Marissa L.|last2=Gomulkiewicz|first2=Richard|date=2011-02-22|title=Introgressive hybridization as a mechanism for species rescue|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12080-011-0118-0|journal=Theoretical Ecology|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=223–239|doi=10.1007/s12080-011-0118-0|issn=1874-1738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Florida panther ===
{{See also|Florida panther}}
A case of successful genetic rescue can be observed in the [[Florida panther]] population. Habitat loss and other anthropogenic influences led to  small, inbred population which increased the decline of this subspecies (''[[Cougar|Puma concolor]] coryi''), .&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pimm|first=S. L.|last2=Dollar|first2=L.|last3=Bass|first3=O.

=== Isle Royale wolves ===
A case of unsuccessful genetic rescue can be observed in the [[Isle Royale]] wolf population. In 1997, a single immigrant arrived on the island and bred with the wolf population of about 25 individuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Initially, the addition of his genetic variation resulted in a positive effects on the population , shown by a large increase in population fitness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the addition of genetic variation by this immigrant was only beneficial in the short term. The population swiftly declined, with only two wolves sighted in 2016.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; it is possible that the new immigrant brought a new detrimental allele that increased in frequency as he interbred with the original population or that a single individual was insufficient to overcome the negative impact of genetic load.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Greater Prairie Chicken ===
The greater prairie chicken is a ground-nesting bird with ecological and evolutionary hurdles that necessitated genetic rescue to avoid extinction.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mussmann|first=S. M.|last2=Douglas|first2=M. R.|last3=Anthonysamy|first3=W. J. B.|last4=Davis|first4=M. A.|last5=Simpson|first5=S. A.|last6=Louis|first6=W.|last7=Douglas|first7=M. E.|date=2017-02-22|title=Genetic rescue, the greater prairie chicken and the problem of conservation reliance in the Anthropocene|journal=Royal Society Open Science|volume=4|issue=2|doi=10.1098/rsos.160736|issn=2054-5703|pmc=5367285|pmid=28386428}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely distributed across the North American great plains but now requires population management in small remnant areas. In Illinois, the greater prairie chicken declined from millions of individuals in the mid 19th century to 46 by 1998. This prompted genetic rescue efforts and movement of individuals from neighboring states to increase Illinois greater prairie chicken numbers. This has been considered an early and successful case of genetic rescue. Although the initial genetic rescue actions seem to have led to an increase in fitness, prairie habitat is now limiting recovery. Exclusively genetic efforts to rescue the species are considered insufficient and more focus on habitat protection may be required to save the species.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''''Glittering Images: A Journey Through Art from Egypt to Star Wars''''' is a 2012 book by American cultural critic [[Camille Paglia]], in which the author discusses notable works of [[Applied arts|applied]] and [[Visual arts|visual art]] from ancient to modern times. Paglia wrote that she intended it to be a personalized "journey" through [[art history]], focusing on [[Western world|Western]] works. Paglia writes that she felt inspired to write given that she worries 21st century Americans are overexposed to visual stimulation by the "all-pervasive mass media" and must fight to keep their capacity for [[contemplation]].&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt;

The book features twenty-nine sections, with glossy full-color illustrations, each focused on a specific piece.&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt; Artists detailed include [[Titian]], [[Manet]], [[Picasso]], and [[Jackson Pollock]] among others. After its October 16, 2012 release, the book received positive reviews from publications such as ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;&lt;ref name=inquirer&gt;{{cite news|last=Derakhshani|first=Tirdad|title=Camille Paglia hopes to reignite regular folks' interest in the arts|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-10-17/entertainment/34500629_1_camille-paglia-sexual-personae-western-art|date=October 17, 2012|publisher=''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it also picked up more critical, negative reviews from publications such as ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Charioteer of Delphi-2.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Paglia discusses the [[Charioteer of Delphi]], a notable [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] work.&lt;ref name=delphi/&gt;]]

While touching on the themes of Paglia's previous work, ''Glittering Images'' focuses on modern cultural [[ignorance]].&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt; Paglia wrote what she intended as a personalized "journey" through art history since she believes people today have become visually overexposed by the mass-media and disconnected from the past.&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt; In it, she argues, "the eye is assaulted, coerced, desensitized."&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;

Paglia discusses twenty-nine examples of visual artwork. Paglia begins by describing the [[ancient Egypt]]ian funerary images of [[Nefertari (18th dynasty)|Queen Nefertari]],&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt; a royal whose name means "the most beautiful of them all". Paglia refers to how the civilization "dreamed of conquering the terrors of death", and she notes how "Egyptian painted figures float in an abstract space that is neither here nor there", describing the visual power of this "eternal present" depicted.&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.3-5&lt;/ref&gt; She then turns to the [[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic]] statuettes carved by [[Bronze Age]] residents of several [[Aegean Sea]] islands, which feature "coolly geometric" designs unlike that of the voluptuous figures carved by earlier, [[Stone Age]] people (such as the '[[Venus of Willendorf]]') while still displaying [[vulva]]e markings and prominent breasts that convey femininity. These pieces of [[Cycladic art]] are cited as "daring explorations of form and structure" foreshadowing the future.&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The author then describes the '[[Charioteer of Delphi]]', a work from the fifth century BC that she writes embodies well the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] ideals of "young male beauty" and the building of character through personal striving. She states how she finds the chariot racing athlete "grave and dignified" with his meditative expression, giving a "look that would become canonical for gods and heroes in the classic tradition".&lt;ref name=delphi&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.15-18&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to write about the '[[Erechtheion#The Porch of the Caryatids|Porch of the Maidens]]' in the [[Erechtheion]] in [[Athens, Greece]], with columns carved into feminine shapes that she labels as "a remarkable display of female power" as "muscular strength" co-exists with womanly curves,&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.21&lt;/ref&gt; and then the piece '[[Laocoön and His Sons]]', a violent scene carved in marble in which [[sea serpent]]s attempt to slay a man and his three sons that stridently addresses the problem of [[theodicy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:KellsFol007vMadonnaChild V2.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Paglia praises the intricacy of the [[Book of Kells]], the section devoted to [[Virgin Mary]] pictured here.&lt;ref name=kells/&gt;]]

The book goes on next to the famous [[mosaic]] of [[Saint John Chrysostom]] in the [[Hagia Sophia]], a piece that Paglia writes as having an "implacable intensity of gaze" making it a great piece of [[Byzantine art]],&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.36-37&lt;/ref&gt; and additionally to the late eighth century Ireland's [[Book of Kells]], an "intricately decorated manuscript of the Gospels that is one of the most beautiful objects surviving from medieval Europe."&lt;ref name=kells&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.39&lt;/ref&gt; The eight piece included is [[Donatello]]'s '[[Mary Magdalene (Donatello)|Mary Magdalene]]', a work of the [[Italian Renaissance]] created in 1453 that showed the artist's ability to be "harsh and imposing".&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.43&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia then discusses [[Titian]]'s '[[Venus with a Mirror]]'; she writes about the artistic changes it symbolizes as the strong brushwork and liberal use of paint allow for warm flesh tones, Titian creating "opulent nudes that thrust sexual display and fantasy" onto the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.49&lt;/ref&gt;

Paglia next discusses [[Bronzino]]'s 'Portrait of Andrea Doria as Neptune', writing that as a work of the [[Mannerism]] movement it shows a "polished theatricality" arresting to the viewer,&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.53&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]'s '[[Chair of Saint Peter]]' in the [[Vatican City]], a 17th-century work showing how [[Baroque art]] often "overwhelms the senses with flamboyant grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.59&lt;/ref&gt;

She takes a nuanced view of the lasting influence of [[pop art]], writing that, generally, the artistic movement "projects an innocent child’s view of the world."&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt; She also argues that works by artists such as [[Andy Warhol]], whom she praises, conveyed powerful subtleties with their pieces. The book details '[[Marilyn Diptych]]', a 1962 silkscreen that replicates a photo of [[Marilyn Monroe]] over and over with image variations, and the work is lauded for strongly showing the "multiplicity of meanings" in the actress' life and legacy.&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;

The book additionally cites [[Eleanor Antin]]'s [[conceptual art]] project '100 Boots'. Paglia praises the work, writing that "boots, like their creator, are outsiders, eternal migrants questing for knowledge and experience."&lt;ref name=roth/&gt;

==Reception==
Writer John Adams of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' published a critical review of the book, viewing it as being "so agenda driven and so riddled with polemic asides that its potential to persuade is forever being compromised." Adams noted that the book avoided discussions of [[Giotto]], [[Michelangelo]], [[El Greco]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]], and [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]], which he criticized. He supported how Paglia "encourages us to read more closely and to look more imaginatively" at the world of [[art history]], though concluded that her praise of [[George Lucas]] was assessing art "by its reach rather than its depth", and thus Paglia "has journeyed to the wrong continent, and what she has found glittering there is fool's gold."&lt;ref name="on-art"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=John|title=Paglia on Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/books/review/glittering-images-by-camille-paglia.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|date=November 30, 2012|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Gary Rosen of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', however, praised the book's "impressive range" and accessibility for a general audience. He argued that "[f]or the most part, Ms. Paglia chooses well, from works both celebrated and obscure", and he stated that the author "is especially good at the difficult trick of providing context for the newcomer to art history without being tedious for a more experienced reader."&lt;ref name=WSJ1&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Gary|title=The Pagan Aesthetic|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390443675404578058504002593338|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=July 17, 2014|date=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' ran a supportive article that labeled the book a "magisterial, poetically composed, and masterly study".&lt;ref name=inquirer/&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a supportive review by [[Michael S. Roth]], an author and the president of [[Wesleyan University]]. He wrote, "Artists, questing outsiders, are still with us, still finding their way, making their way. Perhaps some of them will be inspired by the glittering images Camille Paglia offers here."&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Michael S. Roth]]|title=Art appreciation 101: 'Glittering Images' by Camille Paglia|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/28/entertainment/la-ca-jc-camille-paglia-20121230|date=December 28, 2012|publisher=''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''|accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green furniture''', often symbolized by a tree, are products that use materials from sustainable forests, have low toxic material levels, locally manufactured and are durable enough to last. It should lend itself to easy repair, disassembly, and recycling. Products certified by MBDC’s C2C ([[Cradle to Cradle Design|Cradle 2 Cradle]]) product regimen are a perfect example, like certified [[office chair]]s from [[Herman Miller (office equipment)|Herman Miller]], Mebelluks (Russia) and [[Steelcase]]. These product can be easily taken apart, sorted into their constituent parts, and recycled at the end of their useful lives.

An '''International Certificate of Competence''' ('''ICC''') is a certificate, which may be issued to anyone who has successfully completed certain ''national boating licenses'' or has passed an ''examination'' to prove the necessary competence for [[pleasure craft]] operation.

Persons wishing to be tested in the United Kingdom need to be tested by an approved ICC test centre 

Although only guaranteed to be accepted in countries that have adopted the relevant UN Resolution, the ICC is a useful document to carry and will generally be accepted where proof of competence is required.

In very general terms an ICC is required for the inland waterways of [[Europe]] and for inland and coastal waters of [[Mediterranean Countries|Mediterranean countries]]. For the coastal waters of [[Northern Europe]] the ICC is generally  not required, however to all of these generalisations there are exceptions.

==Description of the ICC==

The ICC is a product of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] Inland Water Committee (UN ECE IWC) Resolution 40 (hereafter called Resolution 40).&lt;ref name="res40"&gt;{{cite web
|title=International Certificate for Operators of Pleasure Craft - Resolution No. 40, Revision 3
|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/2013/sc3wp3/ECE-TRANS-SC3-147-rev3e.pdf 
|work=ECE/TRANS/SC.3/147/Rev.3
|date=2012-10-12
|publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Inland Transport Committee, Working Party on Inland Water Transport
|location=New York and Geneva
|accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This states that the ICC may be issued by a government of one state to its nationals and residents who may be on the waters of a foreign state, on condition that both accept the requirements and conditions set out in Resolution 40.

Governments may appoint competent authorities to issue ICC on their behalf. Globally [[International Yacht Training Worldwide]] (IYT) has been delegated such authority by both Ireland and the UK, and the [[Royal Yachting Association]] (RYA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noonsite.com/Members/val/R2011-04-04-1 Some Good News Regarding the International Certificate of Competence]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]] (BSAC) are both authorized by the UK.
    
The ICC provides documentary assurance from one government to another that the holder meets the levels of competence laid down in Resolution 40. However, the acceptance of Resolution 40 is often caveated.

==History of the ICC==

The origins of the ICC arose from navigation on the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]] ([[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]]) and the need for reassurance that vessel operators were competent to ensure safety of navigation and protection of the environment as they moved from one country to another. As a result, on 29 January 1979, the United Nations Working Party on Inland Water Transport adopted '''Resolution 14''', which recommended the introduction of a European document for an International Certificate (International Card) to provide those assurances.&lt;ref name="res14"&gt;{{cite web
|title=International Certificate (International Card) Concerning the Competence of Pleasure Craft Operators - Resolution No. 14, revised
|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/finaldocs/sc3/TRANS-SC3-131e.pdf
|work=Compendium of resolutions of the Principal Working Party on Inland Water Transport, TRANS/SC.3/131
|date= 29 January 1979
|page=27
|publisher= United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Inland Transport Committee, Working Party on Inland Water Transport
|accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Resolution was also intended to facilitate 'waterborne tourism'.  Until then operators could well have been expected to produce competency certificates for each country whose waters they were on.

In the mid-nineties, the Working Group on Inland Water Transport considered that Resolution 14 needed updating and strengthening and on 16 October 1998 the Working Party adopted their revisions as Resolution 40; this replaced Resolution 14.

The ''International Certificate for Operators of Pleasure Craft'' created in Resolution 40 is now more commonly referred to as the ''International Certificate of Competence'' or simply ''ICC''. The ICC is only applicable where the visited state has also adopted or recognises the ICC as a valid standard of competency.

==Application of the ICC==

Resolution 40 not only included operators of pleasure craft bound for or on the inland and coastal waters of foreign states but specifically included bareboat charter vessels. Significantly, it also set out the nautical, regulatory and technical competency requirements to be achieved and a minimum age (16 years of age) for the issue of an ICC irrespective of individual national schemes.

It is the professional opinion of the UNECE IWC that the standards set out in Resolution 40 provide a reasonable and appropriate level of competence for day sailing with due regard to the safety of navigation and crew and the protection of the environment. It is strongly recommended that governments recognise this rather than be drawn into discussions on where the ICC may or may not fit into their own national schemes – much the same as acceptance of the [[International Driving Permit|international driving licence]].

As of 2013 only 22 countries have adopted either resolution so far, of which 16 are [[European Union|EU]] [[Member state of the European Union|member states]]. In reality many countries choose to accept the ICC even though they have not adopted the resolution – but of course this is on their terms and can be subject to local variations. [[Spain]], [[Greece]] and [[Portugal]], for example, have not adopted Resolution 40 but are still most likely to ask visitors for an ICC. In reality, the ICC is more widely accepted as proof of the holder’s competence than adoption of Resolution 40 would suggest.&lt;ref name="ryaref"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rya.org.uk/infoadvice/boatingabroad/icc/Pages/icc.aspx | title = About the ICC / The ICC and Proof of Competence Abroad / Boating Abroad / Information &amp; Advice | accessdate = 2010-10-10 | date = 2010-08-03 | publisher = RYA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation of Resolution 40===
The following [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|UNECE]] member states have adopted Resolution 40 and thus officially accept the ICC as a proof of competence in their territories:&lt;ref name="res40" /&gt;

[[Austria]],
[[Belarus]],
[[Belgium]],
[[Bulgaria]],
[[Croatia]],
[[Czech Republic]],
[[Finland]],
[[Germany]],
[[Hungary]],
[[Ireland]],
[[Lithuania]],
[[Luxembourg]],
[[Netherlands]],
[[Norway]],
[[Romania]],
[[Slovakia]],
[[South Africa]] (not a member state),
[[Switzerland]] and
the [[United Kingdom]].

===Implementation of Resolution 14===
The following UNECE member states have adopted the earlier Resolution 14. Also these countries accept the ICC:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.unece.org/trans/main/sc3/sc3res.html
|title=Application of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Resolutions relating to Inland Navigation
|format=PDF
|at=See item ''Annual report on the acceptance of the resolutions''
|accessdate=2013-11-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[France]],
[[Italy]] and
[[Poland]].

===States that have not adopted Resolution 40===
The following UNECE member states have not accepted the Resolution 40 nor the  Resolution 14:

Greece,
[[Moldova]],
Portugal,
Spain,
[[Russian Federation]],
[[Serbia]],
[[Sweden]],
[[Ukraine]] and
[[United States]].

==Individual states==

===Finland===
Finland has adopted the resolution but does not require the ICC for normal yachts ("sufficient age and skill" is enough) and does not use [[CEVNI]] for its inland waters.

Some official and some quality assured non-official certificates (mainly the coastal master certificates of the navigation association and the scouts) are regarded as fulfilling knowledge requirements of ICC for coastal waters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veneily.fi/sv/sjomanskap/behorighet Trafi: Internationellt behörighetsbrev för förare av fritidsbåt]&lt;/ref&gt; Courses for the CEVNI part are arranged separately by many organisations. The certificate itself is issued by the authorities, usually based on such documents.

The ICC is required for masters of boats chartered manned for international voyages (in addition to a domestic certificate) and for masters of recreational vessels with length more than 24 metres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/sv/laki/ajantasa/2009/20091687 Lag om fartygspersonal och säkerhetsorganisation för fartyg (29.12.2009/1687)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
[[International Yacht Training Worldwide|IYT Worldwide]] is authorized by the [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport|Irish Department of Transport]] to issue ICCs to any nationality provided they meet the knowledge and competency standards required. The [[Irish Sailing Association]] is authorized by the [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport|Irish Department of Transport]]. Uniquely, IYT Worldwide has been approved by the Irish Government to issue ICC s to any qualified applicants of any nationality on their behalf. 
The ICC enables owners  vessels to use them in those European waters where an ICC is required, and proves to local authorities that the skipper has the required Irish qualifications for skippering the vessel.

===United Kingdom===
[[International Yacht Training Worldwide]] (IYT Worldwide), The [[Royal Yachting Association]] (RYA),  and the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]] (BSAC) are with the authority of the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] (MCA) approved to issue ICCs to those who meet the mandated requirements and the competency requirements.

ICC's are able to be issued by these Associations to citizens of Nations who are not signatories. In this manner, for example, USA citizens can gain the ICC. In the USA, NauticEd International Sailing Education facilitates the issuance of the ICC through the UK government via the Royal Yachting Association.

UK ICCs are for use on British registered vessels in the waters of foreign states that participate in Resolution 40, without the need to comply with those states’ national certification requirements. An ICC does not enable a British ICC holder to skipper a non-British registered vessel. If a British skipper wants to skipper a non-British registered vessel then he/she must be qualified per the regulations of the country in which the vessel is registered.

The UK ICC was only available to British citizens or bona fide British residents.This has now been extended to cover other Nationals.

'''Kenneth Earl Wilber II''' (born January 31, 1949) is an American writer on [[transpersonal psychology]] and his own [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|integral theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Forman, ''A guide to integral psychotherapy: complexity, integration, and spirituality in practice,'' [[SUNY Press]] 2010, p. 9. {{ISBN|978-1-4384-3023-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a systematic philosophy which suggests the synthesis of all human knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name="wilber-intro" /&gt;

==Biography==
Wilber was born in 1949 in Oklahoma City. In 1967 he enrolled as a [[pre-medical|pre-med]] student at [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Schwartz (author)|Tony Schwartz]], ''What Really Matters: Searching for Wisdom in America'', Bantam, 1996, {{ISBN|0-553-37492-3}}, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; He became inspired, like many of his generation, by Eastern literature, particularly the [[Tao Te Ching]]. He left Duke and enrolled at the [[University of Nebraska at Lincoln]], but after a few years dropped out of university to devote all his time to studying his own curriculum and writing books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/teachers/teachers.php?id=310|title=Ken Wilber – Teachers – Spirituality &amp; Practice|work=spiritualityandpractice.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131218/http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/teachers/teachers.php?id=310|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilber stated in 2011 that he has long suffered from [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], possibly caused by [[RNase]] enzyme deficiency disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilber |first=Ken |title=Ken Wilber Writes About His Horrific, Near-Fatal Illness |url=http://www.nhne.org/news/NewsArticlesArchive/tabid/400/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2292/language/en-US/Ken-Wilber-Writes-About-His-Horrific-Near-Fatal-Illness.aspx |accessdate=26 May 2011 |newspaper=New Heaven New Earth |date=December 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724141023/http://www.nhne.org/news/NewsArticlesArchive/tabid/400/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2292/language/en-US/Ken-Wilber-Writes-About-His-Horrific-Near-Fatal-Illness.aspx |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilber|first=Ken|title=RNase Enzyme Deficiency Disease: Wilber's statement about his health|url=http://www.integralworld.net/redd.html|work=IntegralWorld.net|publisher=October 22, 2002|accessdate=26 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605120119/http://www.integralworld.net/redd.html|archivedate=5 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 Wilber completed his first book, ''The Spectrum of Consciousness'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/The_spectrum_of_consciousness.html?id=Wvw9pzzp1C0C | title = The Spectrum of Consciousness | isbn = 9780835606950 | author1 = Wilber | first1 = Ken | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he sought to integrate knowledge from disparate fields. After rejections by more than twenty publishers it was finally accepted in 1977 by [[Quest Books]], and he spent a year giving lectures and workshops before going back to writing. He also helped to launch the journal ''ReVision'' in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Visser, ''Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion'', 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 New Science Library published his anthology ''The Holographic Paradigm and Other Paradoxes'',&lt;ref&gt;The Holographic Paradigm and other paradoxes, 1982, {{ISBN|0-87773-238-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of essays and interviews, including one by [[David Bohm]]. The essays, including one of his own, looked at how [[holography]] and the [[holographic paradigm]] relate to the fields of consciousness, mysticism, and science.

In 1983 Wilber married Terry "Treya" Killam who was shortly thereafter diagnosed with breast cancer. From 1984 until 1987, Wilber gave up most of his writing to care for her. Killam died in January 1989; their joint experience was recorded in the 1991 book ''Grace and Grit''.

In 1987 Wilber moved to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Colorado]], where he worked on his Kosmos trilogy and oversaw the work of the [[Integral Institute]]. Wilber now lives in [[Denver]], Colorado.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Subsequently, Wilber wrote ''[[Sex, Ecology, Spirituality]]'' (1995), the first volume of his ''Kosmos Trilogy''. ''A Brief History of Everything'' (1996) was the popularised summary of ''Sex, Ecology, Spirituality'' in interview format. ''The Eye of Spirit'' (1997) was a compilation of articles he had written for the journal ''ReVision'' on the relationship between science and religion. Throughout 1997, he had kept journals of his personal experiences, which were published in 1999 as ''One Taste'', a term for [[Cosmic consciousness|unitary consciousness]]. Over the next two years his publisher, [[Shambhala Publications]], released eight re-edited volumes of his ''Collected Works''. In 1999, he finished ''Integral Psychology'' and wrote ''[[A Theory of Everything]]'' (2000). In ''A Theory of Everything'' Wilber attempts to bridge business, politics, science and spirituality and show how they integrate with theories of developmental psychology, such as [[Spiral Dynamics]]. His novel, ''[[Boomeritis]]'' (2002), attempts to expose what he perceives as the [[egotism]] of the [[baby boomers|baby boom generation]].

In 2012 Wilber joined the [[Advisory board|Advisory Board]] of [[International Simultaneous Policy Organization]] which seeks to end the usual deadlock in tackling global issues through an international simultaneous policy.&lt;ref name="About Simpol-UK"&gt;About Simpol-UK: [http://simpol.org/index.php?id=62 uk.simpol.org&amp;nbsp;– About Simpol-UK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729182456/http://simpol.org/index.php?id=62 |date=2013-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Endorsements"&gt;Endorsements: [http://simpol.org/index.php?id=11 Simpol.org&amp;nbsp;– Endorsements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729191229/http://simpol.org/index.php?id=11 |date=2013-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Quadrants All Levels (AQAL), pronounced "ah-qwul", is the basic framework of integral theory. It models human knowledge and experience with a four-quadrant grid, along the axes of "interior-exterior" and "individual-collective". According to Wilber, it is a comprehensive approach to reality, a metatheory that attempts to explain how academic disciplines and every form of knowledge and experience fit together coherently.&lt;ref name="wilber-intro"&gt;Rentschler, Matt. [http://iniciativaintegral.es/Documentos%20P%C3%BAblicos/1.-%20Teor%C3%ADa/AQAL_Glossary_01-27-07.pdf "AQAL Glossary,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228172258/http://iniciativaintegral.es/Documentos%20P%C3%BAblicos/1.-%20Teor%C3%ADa/AQAL_Glossary_01-27-07.pdf |date=2017-12-28 }} "AQAL: Journal of Integral Theory and Practice," Fall 2006, Vol. 1, No. 3. Retrieved on Dec. 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

AQAL is based on four fundamental concepts and a rest-category: four quadrants, several levels and lines of development, several states of consciousness, and "types", topics which do not fit into these four concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fiandt | first1 = K. | last2 = Forman | first2 = J. | last3 = Erickson Megel | first3 = M. | display-authors = etal | year = 2003 | title = Integral nursing: an emerging framework for engaging the evolution of the profession | url = http://www.nursingoutlook.org/article/S0029-6554(03)00080-0/abstract | journal = Nursing Outlook | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 130–137 | doi=10.1016/s0029-6554(03)00080-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Levels" are the stages of development, from pre-personal through personal to transpersonal. "Lines" of development are various domains which may progress unevenly through different stages .{{refn|group=note|This interpretation is at odds with [[structural stage theory]], which posits an overall follow-up of stages, instead of variations over several domains.}} "States" are states of consciousness; according to Wilber persons may have a temporal experience of a higher developmental stage.{{refn|group=note|This too is at odds with structural stage theory, but in line with Wilber's philosophical idealism, which sees the phenomenal world as a concretisation, or immanation, of a "higher," transcendental reality, which can be "realized" in "religious experience."}} "Types" is a rest-category, for phenomena which do not fit in the other four concepts.&lt;ref&gt;"Integral Psychology" In: Weiner, Irving B. &amp; Craighead, W. Edward (ed.), ''The Corsini encyclopedia of psychology'', Vol. 2, 4. ed., Wiley 2010, pp. 830 ff. {{ISBN|978-0-470-17026-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for an account of the Kosmos to be complete, Wilber believes that it must include each of these five categories. For Wilber, only such an account can be accurately called "integral". In the essay, "Excerpt C: The Ways We Are in This Together", Wilber describes AQAL as "one suggested architecture of the Kosmos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Excerpt C: The Ways We Are In This Together | work=Ken Wilber Online | url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/kosmos/excerptC/intro-1.cfm | accessdate=December 26, 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051223205255/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/kosmos/excerptC/intro-1.cfm/ | archivedate=December 23, 2005 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model's apex is formless awareness, "the simple feeling of being", which is equated with a range of "ultimates" from a variety of eastern traditions. This formless awareness transcends the phenomenal world, which is ultimately only an appearance of some transcendental reality. According to Wilber, the AQAL categories&amp;nbsp;— quadrants, lines, levels, states, and types&amp;nbsp;– describe the relative truth of the [[two truths doctrine]] of [[Buddhism]]. According to Wilber, none of them are true in an absolute sense. Only formless awareness, "the simple feeling of being", exists absolutely.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}{{refn|group=note|The [[Madhyamaka]] two truths doctrine discerns two epistemological truths, namely conventional and ultimate. Conventional truth is the truth of phenomenal appearances and causal relations, our daily common-sense world. Ultimate truth is the recognition that no-"thing" exists inherently; every-"thing" is empty, [[sunyata]] of an unchanging "essence". It also means that there is no unchanging transcendental reality underlying phenomenal existence. "Formless awareness" belongs to another strand of Indian thinking, namely Advaita and Buddha-nature, which are ontological approaches, and ''do'' posit such a transcendental, unchanging reality, namely "awareness" or "consciousness." Wilber seems to be mixing, or confusing, these two different approaches freely, in his attempt to integrate "everything" into one conceptual scheme.}}

==Other ideas==

===Mysticism and the great chain of being===
One of Wilber's main interests is in mapping what he calls the "neo-perennial philosophy", an integration of some of the views of mysticism typified by [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]''  with an account of cosmic [[evolution]] akin to that of the Indian mystic [[Sri Aurobindo]]. He rejects most of the tenets of [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]] and the associated anti-evolutionary view of history as a regression from past ages or [[yuga]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"I have not identified myself with the perennial philosophy in over fifteen years ... Many of the enduring perennial philosophers—such as [[Nagarjuna]]—were already using postmetaphysical methods, which is why their insights are still quite valid. But the vast majority of perennial philosophers were caught in metaphysical, not critical, thought, which is why I reject their methods almost entirely, and accept their conclusions only to the extent they can be reconstructed"{{cite web |url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/habermas/index.cfm/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322225146/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/habermas/index.cfm |archivedate=2006-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he embraces a more traditionally [[Western world|Western]] notion of the [[great chain of being]]. As in the work of [[Jean Gebser]], this great chain (or "nest") is ever-present while relatively unfolding throughout this material manifestation, although to Wilber "... the 'Great Nest' is actually just a vast [[Morphic field|morphogenetic field]] of potentials ..." In agreement with Mahayana Buddhism, and [[Advaita Vedanta]], he believes that reality is ultimately a [[nondual]] union of [[Sunyata|emptiness]] and [[substantial form|form]], with form being innately subject to development over time.

===Theory of truth===

Wilber believes that the mystical traditions of the world provide access to, and knowledge of, a transcendental reality which is [[Perennial philosophy|perennial]], being the same throughout all times and cultures. This proposition underlies the whole of his conceptual edifice, and is an unquestioned assumption.{{refn|group=note|The perennial position is "largely dismissed by scholars",{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} but "has lost none of its popularity".{{sfn|McMahan|2010|p=269, note 9}} Mainstream academia favor a constructivist approach, which is rejected by Wilber as a dangerous relativism. See also [[Mysticism|Perennialism versus constructionism]].}} Wilber juxtaposites this generalisation to plain materialism, presenting this as the main paradigma of regular science.&lt;ref name="mystics" /&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Wilber: "Are the mystics and sages insane? Because they all tell variations on the same story, don't they? The story of awakening one morning and discovering you are one with the All, in a timeless and eternal and infinite fashion. Yes, maybe they are crazy, these divine fools. Maybe they are mumbling idiots in the face of the Abyss. Maybe they need a nice, understanding therapist. Yes, I'm sure that would help. But then, I wonder. Maybe the evolutionary sequence really is from matter to body to mind to soul to spirit, each transcending and including, each with a greater depth and greater consciousness and wider embrace. And in the highest reaches of evolution, maybe, just maybe, an individual's consciousness does indeed touch infinity—a total embrace of the entire Kosmos—a [[cosmic consciousness|Kosmic consciousness]] that is Spirit awakened to its own true nature. It's at least plausible. And tell me: is that story, sung by mystics and sages the world over, any crazier than the [[scientific materialism]] story, which is that the entire sequence is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying absolutely nothing? Listen very carefully: just which of those two stories actually sounds totally insane?"&lt;ref name="mystics"&gt;Ken Wilber, ''A Brief History of Everything'', p.42–3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his later works, Wilber argues that manifest reality is composed of four domains, and that each domain, or "quadrant", has its own truth-standard, or test for validity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Wilber  | first = Ken  | title = The Eye of Spirit | publisher = [[Shambhala]]  | location = Boston  | year = 1998  | pages = 12–18  | isbn = 1-57062-345-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre/trans fallacy===
Wilber believes that many claims about non-rational states make a mistake he calls the pre/trans fallacy. According to Wilber, the non-rational stages of consciousness (what Wilber calls "pre-rational" and "trans-rational" stages) can be easily confused with one another. In Wilber's view, one can reduce trans-rational spiritual realization to pre-rational regression, or one can elevate pre-rational states to the trans-rational domain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev3_intro.cfm Introduction to the third volume of The Collected Works of Ken Wilber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615012815/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev3_intro.cfm/ |date=2009-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wilber claims that Freud and Jung commit this fallacy. [[Freud]] considered mystical realization to be a [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] to [[infantile]] oceanic states. Wilber alleges that Freud thus commits a fallacy of reduction. Wilber thinks that [[Jung]] commits the converse form of the same mistake by considering pre-rational myths to reflect divine realizations. Likewise, pre-rational states may be misidentified as post-rational states.&lt;ref&gt;Wilber, Ken. ''Sex, Ecology, Spirituality''. Shambhala Publications, 2000, pp 211 f. {{ISBN|978-1-57062-744-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber characterizes himself as having fallen victim to the pre/trans fallacy in his early work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The introduction to Volume 1 of The Collected Works of Ken Wilber |work=Ken Wilber Online |url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev1_intro.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319023750/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev1_intro.cfm/ |archivedate=2009-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilber on science===
Wilber describes the current state of the "hard" sciences as limited to "narrow science", which only allows evidence from the lowest realm of consciousness, the [[wikt:sensorimotor|sensorimotor]] (the five senses and their extensions). Wilber sees science in the broad sense as characterized by involving three steps:&lt;ref name="RothbergKelly1998-p12"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donald Jay Rothberg|author2=Sean M. Kelly|author3=Sean Kelly|title=Ken Wilber in Dialogue: Conversations with Leading Transpersonal Thinkers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1GUlPmlPD0C&amp;pg=PA12|date=1 February 1998|publisher=Quest Books|isbn=978-0-8356-0766-7|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard2005-p2-3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lew Howard|title=Introducing Ken Wilber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=svCgg2VVR5oC&amp;pg=PA2|date=17 May 2005|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4634-8193-3|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* specifying an experiment,
* performing the experiment and observing the results, and
* checking the results with others who have competently performed the same experiment.
He has presented these as "three strands of valid knowledge" in Part III of his book ''[[The Marriage of Sense and Soul]]''.&lt;ref name="Wilber2011-p187"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Wilber|title=The Marriage of Sense and Soul: Integrating Science and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQGmVyPN6rUC&amp;pg=PT187|date=3 August 2011|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-79956-2|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What Wilber calls "broad science" would include evidence from [[logic]], [[mathematics]], and from the [[symbol]]ic, [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]], and other realms of [[consciousness]]. Ultimately and ideally, broad science would include the testimony of [[meditation|meditators]] and [[spiritual practice|spiritual practitioners]]. Wilber's own conception of science includes both narrow science and broad science, e.g., using [[electroencephalogram]] machines and other technologies to test the experiences of meditators and other spiritual practitioners, creating what Wilber calls "integral science".{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

According to Wilber's theory, narrow science trumps narrow religion, but broad science trumps narrow science. That is, the natural sciences provide a more inclusive, accurate account of [[reality]] than any of the particular [[exoteric]] religious traditions. But an integral approach that uses intersubjectivity to evaluate both religious claims and scientific claims will give a more complete account of reality than narrow science.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Wilber has referred to [[Stuart Kauffman]], [[Ilya Prigogine]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and others in order to articulate his [[Vitalism|vitalistic]] and [[Teleology|teleological]] understanding of reality, which is deeply at odds with the [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Wilber: "I am not alone in seeing that chance and natural selection by themselves are not enough to account for the emergence that we see in evolution. Stuart Kaufman{{sic}} and many others have criticized mere change and natural selection as not adequate to account for this emergence (he sees the necessity of adding self-organization). Of course I understand that natural selection is not acting on mere randomness or chance—because natural selection saves previous selections, and this reduces dramatically the probability that higher, adequate forms will emerge. But even that is not enough, in my opinion, to account for the remarkable emergence of some of the extraordinarily complex forms that nature has produced. After all, from the big bang and dirt to the poems of William Shakespeare is quite a distance, and many philosophers of science agree that mere chance and selection are just not adequate to account for these remarkable emergences. The universe is slightly tilted toward self-organizing processes, and these processes—as Prigogine was the first to elaborate—escape present-level turmoil by jumping to higher levels of self-organization, and I see that "pressure" as operating throughout the physiosphere, the biosphere, and the noosphere. And that is what I metaphorically mean when I use the example of a wing (or elsewhere, the example of an eyeball) to indicate the remarkableness of increasing emergence. But I don't mean that as a specific model or actual example of how biological emergence works! Natural selection carries forth previous individual mutations—but again that just isn't enough to account for creative emergence (or what Whitehead called "the creative advance into novelty," which, according to Whitehead, is the fundamental nature of this manifest universe)."&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;Ken Wilber, ''[http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/390 Re: Some Criticisms of My Understanding of Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907151307/http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/390 |date=2011-09-07 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Current work===
In 2005, at the launch of the Integral Spiritual Center, a branch of the [[Integral Institute]], Wilber presented a 118-page rough draft summary of his two forthcoming books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Integral Spirituality? |work=Integral Spiritual Center |url=http://integralspiritualcenter.org/Integral%20Spirituality.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=December 26, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125133004/http://integralspiritualcenter.org/Integral%2BSpirituality.pdf |archivedate=November 25, 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }} (1.3 MB [[portable document format|PDF]] file)&lt;/ref&gt; The essay is entitled "What is Integral Spirituality?", and contains several new ideas, including Integral post-metaphysics and the Wilber-Combs lattice. In 2006, he published "Integral Spirituality", in which he elaborated on these ideas, as well as others such as Integral Methodological Pluralism and  the developmental conveyor belt of religion.

"Integral post-metaphysics" is the term Wilber has given to his attempts to reconstruct the world's [[spirituality|spiritual]]-[[religion|religious]] traditions in a way that accounts for the [[Modernism|modern]] and [[post-modern]] criticisms of those traditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

The Wilber-Combs Lattice is a conceptual model of [[consciousness]] developed by Wilber and [[Allan Combs]]. It is a grid with sequential [[states of consciousness]] on the x axis (from left to right) and with developmental structures, or [[Overlapping hierarchy|levels]], of consciousness on the y axis (from bottom to top). This lattice illustrates how each structure of consciousness interprets experiences of different states of consciousness, including mystical states, in different ways.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Since then, Wilber has drawn back from public life, due to a severe illness.

Wilber attracted a lot of controversy from 2011 to the present day by supporting [[Marc Gafni]]. Gafni was accused in the media of sexually assaulting a minor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/opinion/329620/i-was-13-when-marc-gafnis-abuse-began/|title='I Was 13 When Marc Gafni's Abuse Began'|author=|date=|website=forward.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204000533/https://forward.com/opinion/329620/i-was-13-when-marc-gafnis-abuse-began/|archivedate=4 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilber has in fact publicly supported Gafni on his blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.integrallife.com/member/ken-wilber/blog/ken-wilbers-response-marc-gafni-debacle |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206165122/https://www.integrallife.com/member/ken-wilber/blog/ken-wilbers-response-marc-gafni-debacle |archivedate=2016-02-06 |df= }}?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/701|title=+kenwilber.com - blog|author=|date=|website=www.kenwilber.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028230143/http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/701|archivedate=28 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A petition begun by a group of Rabbis has called for Wilber to publicly dissociate from Gafni.

==Influences on Wilber==
Wilber's philosophy has been influenced by [[Madhyamaka]] [[Buddhism]], particularly as articulated in the philosophy of [[Nagarjuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Kosmos According to Ken Wilber: A Dialogue with Robin Kornman | date=September 1996 | work=Shambhala Sun | url=http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2059 | accessdate=2006-06-14 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813160309/http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2059 | archivedate=2006-08-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber has practiced various forms of Buddhist meditation, studying (however briefly) with a number of teachers, including [[Dainin Katagiri]], [[Taizan Maezumi]], [[Chogyam Trungpa]] [[Rinpoche]], [[Kalu Rinpoche]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Penor Rinpoche]] and [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]]. [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Kaśmir Śaivism|Trika (Kashmir) Shaivism]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Zen Buddhism]], [[Ramana Maharshi]], and [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]] can be mentioned as further influences.  Wilber has on several occasions singled out [[Adi Da]]'s work for the highest praise while expressing reservations about Adi Da as a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/adida.cfm/ |title=The Case of Adi Da |accessdate= |work=Ken Wilber Online |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213072728/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/adida.cfm/ |archive-date=2008-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adidawilber.com/ |title=Adi Da and The Case of Ken Wilber |accessdate= |quote=I mention Master Da (along with Christ, Krishna) as being the Divine Person as World Event. - Ken Wilber, Up From Eden, 1981 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303124109/http://www.adidawilber.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Sex, Ecology, Spirituality'', Wilber refers extensively to [[Plotinus]]' philosophy, which he sees as nondual. While Wilber has practised [[Buddhist]] meditation methods, he does not identify himself as a Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;# ''Kosmic Consciousness'' (12 hour audio interview on ten CDs), 2003, {{ISBN|1-59179-124-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing movement that considers Wilber as following a long tradition of western psychologists that have liberally appropriated and repackaged Eastern, especially Hindu, thought.

According to Frank Visser, Wilber's conception of four quadrants, or dimensions of existence is very similar to [[E. F. Schumacher]]'s conception of four fields of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Visser, ''Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion'', 194&lt;/ref&gt; Visser finds Wilber's conception of levels, as well as Wilber's critique of science as one-dimensional, to be very similar to that in [[Huston Smith]]'s ''Forgotten Truth''.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Visser, ''Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion'', 78&lt;/ref&gt; Visser also writes that the esoteric aspects of Wilber's theory are based on the philosophy of [[Sri Aurobindo]] as well as other theorists including [[Adi Da]].&lt;ref&gt;Visser, 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Wilber has been categorized as [[New Age]] due to his emphasis on a [[transpersonal]] view&lt;ref&gt;[[Wouter J. Hanegraaff]], ''New Age Religion and Western Culture'', SUNY, 1998, pp.70 (''"Ken Wilber ... defends a transpersonal worldview which qualifies as 'New Age'"'').&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently, as a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Marian de Souza (ed.), ''International handbook of the religious, moral and spiritual dimensions in education'', Dordrecht: Springer 2006, p.93. {{ISBN|978-1-4020-4803-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Publishers Weekly'' has called him "the Hegel of Eastern spirituality".&lt;ref&gt;[{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430053719/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59030-151-7 |date=2014-04-30 }} "The Simple Feeling of Being: Visionary, Spiritual and Poetic Writings"],  publishersweekly.com, June 4, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilber is credited with broadening the appeal of a "perennial philosophy" to a much wider audience.

[[Steve McIntosh]] praises Wilber's work but also argues that Wilber fails to distinguish "philosophy" from his own Vedantic and Buddhist religion.&lt;ref name=McIntosh&gt;Steve McIntosh, ''Integral Consciousness and the Future of Evolution'', Paragon House, St Paul Minnesota, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-55778-867-2}} pp.227f.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Bache]] is complimentary of some aspects of Wilber's work, but calls Wilber's writing style glib.&lt;ref&gt;Notes to Chapter 6 of ''Dark Night Early Dawn: Steps to a Deep Ecology of Mind'' SUNY Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Stanislav Grof]] has praised Wilber's knowledge and work in the highest terms;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;... Ken has produced an extraordinary work of highly creative synthesis of data drawn from a vast variety of areas and disciplines ... His knowledge of the literature is truly encyclopedic, his analytical mind systematic and incisive, and the clarity of his logic remarkable. The impressive scope, comprehensive nature, and intellectual rigor of Ken's work have helped to make it a widely acclaimed and highly influential theory of transpersonal psychology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stanislav Grof, [http://primal-page.com/grofken.htm "Ken Wilber's Spectrum Psychology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209054241/http://primal-page.com/grofken.htm |date=2009-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Grof has criticized the omission of the [[Pre- and perinatal psychology|pre- and peri-natal domains]] from Wilber's spectrum of consciousness, and Wilber's neglect of the psychological importance of biological birth and death.&lt;ref&gt;Grof, ''Beyond the Brain'', 131–137&lt;/ref&gt; Grof has described Wilber's writings as having an "often aggressive polemical style that includes strongly worded ''[[ad personam]]'' attacks and is not conducive to personal dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanislavgrof.com/pdf/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Transpersonal%20Psychology-Grof.pdf Grof, "A Brief History of Transpersonal Psychology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716130649/http://www.stanislavgrof.com/pdf/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Transpersonal%20Psychology-Grof.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber's response is that the world religious traditions do not attest to the importance that Grof assigns to the perinatal.&lt;ref&gt;Visser, 269&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A-major f-sharp-minor.svg|thumb|right|150px|Key signature [[A major]] / [[F-sharp minor|F{{music|#}} minor]] with three sharps placed after the clef.]]

In [[musical notation]], a '''key signature''' is a set of [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] ({{Music|sharp}}), [[Flat (music)|flat]] ({{Music|b}}), and rarely, [[Natural (music)|natural]] ({{Music|natural}}) symbols placed together on the [[staff (music)|staff]].  Key signatures are generally written immediately after the [[clef]] at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a [[Sheet music|score]], notably after a [[Bar (music)|double barline]].

A key signature designates [[note (music)|note]]s that are to be played higher or lower than the corresponding [[natural sign|natural]] notes and applies through to the end of the piece or up to the next key signature.  A sharp symbol on a line or space in the key signature raises the notes on that line or space one [[semitone]] above the natural, and a flat lowers such notes one semitone.  Further, a symbol in the key signature affects all the notes of one letter: for instance, a sharp on the top line of the [[Clef#Treble clef|treble staff]] applies to Fs not only on that line, but also to Fs in the bottom space of the staff, and to any other Fs. This convention was not universal until the late [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and early [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], however; music published in the 1720s and 1730s, for example, uses key signatures showing sharps or flats on both octaves for notes which fall within the staff.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

An [[Accidental (music)|accidental]] is an exception to the key signature, applying only in the measure in which it appears.

Although a key signature may be written using any combination of sharp and flat symbols, the most common series of thirteen homogeneous key signatures—ranging from six flats to six sharps, with each successive flat or sharp placed on the [[circle of fifths|note a perfect fifth below or above]], respectively, the previous one—is assumed in much of this article.  A piece scored using a single diatonic key signature and no accidentals contains notes of at most seven of the twelve [[pitch class]]es, which seven being determined by the particular key signature.

Each [[Major scale|major]] and [[Minor scale|minor]] [[key (music)|key]] has an associated key signature that sharpens or flattens the notes which are used in its scale. However, it is not uncommon for a piece to be written with a key signature that does not match its key, for example, in some Baroque pieces,&lt;ref&gt;Schulenberg, David. ''Music of the Baroque''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=P4x3aKvOQWAC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;vq=%22the+key+of+a+baroque+work%22&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U3x7lhOyyIiT-O_HsTZlZxw8FrkSA p. 72.]. "(…) to determine the key of a Baroque work one must always analyze its tonal structure rather than rely on the key signature."&lt;/ref&gt; or in transcriptions of traditional modal folk tunes.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, David. ''The Petrie Collection of the Ancient Music of Ireland''. Cork: Cork University Press, 2005. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PzrfncNnr4cC&amp;pg=PA25-IA13&amp;vq=%22In+a+few+cases+Petrie+has+given+what+is+clearly+a+modal+melody+a+key+signature+which+suggests+that+it+is+actally+in+a+minor+key%22&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U0BqVPTuQnnaH32iLpCvrYnyT143Q p. 22]. "In a few cases Petrie has given what is clearly a modal melody a key signature which suggests that it is actually in a minor key. For example, ''Banish Misfortune'' is presented in D minor, although it is clearly in the Dorian mode."&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, this use of a key signature that is theoretically incorrect for a piece as a whole or a self-contained section of a piece became less common (in contrast to brief passages within a piece, which, as they modulate from key to key often temporarily disagree with the key signature); but it can be found at least as late as one of Beethoven's very late piano sonatas.  For example, in his [[Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven)|Sonata No. 31 in A{{music|flat}} major, Op. 110]], the first appearance of the Arioso section in the final movement is notated throughout in six flats; but it both begins and ends in A{{music|flat}} minor and has a significant modulation to C{{music|flat}} major, and both these keys theoretically require seven flats in their key signature.  (The second appearance later in the movement of this same section, a semitone lower, in G minor, uses the correct key signature of two flats.)

== Conventions ==

[[File:ks1.gif|thumb|right|200px|1. [[B major]] scale: no key signature; accidentals required throughout]]
{{anchor|scale2}}[[File:ks2.gif|thumb|right|200px|2. [[B major]] scale: key signature; accidentals not needed]]

In principle, any piece can be written with any key signature, using accidentals to correct the pattern of whole and half steps. The purpose of the key signature is to minimize the number of such accidentals required to notate the music. The sequence of sharps or flats in key signatures is generally rigid in modern [[Music notation#Modern notation|music notation]]. This allows musicians to identify the key simply by the number of sharps or flats (which is the same in any clef), rather than their position on the staff. For example, if a key signature has only one sharp, it must be an [[F♯ (musical note)|F-sharp]],&lt;ref name="orderofsharp"&gt;|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-read-key-signatures.html |title=How to Read Key Signatures|accessdate=29 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to a [[G major]] or an [[E minor]] key.

However, in 20th-century music, there are occasional exceptions to this, where a piece uses an unorthodox or synthetic scale, where a key signature may be invented to reflect this.  This may consist of a number of sharps or flats that are not the normal ones (such as a signature of just C{{music|sharp}} or E{{music|flat}}), or it may consist of one or more sharps combined with one or more flats (such as a signature containing both F{{music|sharp}} and B{{music|flat}}).  Key signatures of this kind can be found in the music of [[Béla Bartók]], for example.

The effect of a key signature continues throughout a piece or movement, unless explicitly cancelled by another key signature. For example, if a five-sharp key signature is placed at the beginning of a piece, every A in the piece in any [[octave]] will be played as A sharp, unless preceded by an accidental (for instance, the A in [[#scale2|scale 2]] illustrated – the next-to-last note – is played as an A{{music|sharp}} even though the A{{music|sharp}} in the key signature (the last sharp sign) is written an octave lower).&lt;ref name="orderofsharp" /&gt;

In a score containing more than one instrument, all the instruments are usually written with the same key signature. Exceptions include:
* If an instrument is a [[transposing instrument]].
* If an instrument is a [[percussion instrument]] with indeterminate pitch.
* Composers usually omit the key signature for [[timpani]] parts. Besides not using a key signature, timpani parts were early on also treated often as transposing instrument parts, the pitch of the high drum being written as C and, as timpani were almost always tuned a [[perfect fourth]] apart (dominant on the low drum and tonic on the high drum), the pitch of the low drum being written as G, with the actual pitches indicated at the beginning of the part, e.g. "timpani in D–A", if they were tuned A (low drum) and D (high drum).
* Composers may omit the key signature for [[French horn|horn]] and occasionally [[trumpet]] parts. This is perhaps reminiscent of the early days of brass instruments, when [[Crook (music)|crooks]] would be added to them, in order to change the length of the tubing and allow playing in different keys.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
* On occasion, in more modern works, instruments may be notated in different keys even when they are not transposing instruments, because the music is [[polytonal]] and the different parts are actually in different keys which sound together.

[[File:Circle of fifths deluxe 4.svg|thumb|right|400px|[[Circle of fifths]] showing [[major key|major]] and [[minor key]]s and their signatures]]

=== Notational conventions ===

The convention for the notation of key signatures follows the [[circle of fifths]]. Starting from [[C major]] (or equivalently [[A minor]]) which has no sharps or flats, successively raising the key by a fifth adds a sharp, going clockwise round the circle of fifths. The new sharp is placed on the new key's [[leading note]] (seventh degree) for major keys or [[supertonic]] (second degree) for minor keys. Thus [[G major]] ([[E minor]]) has one sharp which is on the F; then [[D major]] ([[B minor]]) has two sharps on F and C and so on.

Similarly, successively lowering the key by a fifth adds a flat, going counterclockwise around the circle of fifths. The new flat is placed on the [[subdominant]] (fourth degree) for major keys or [[submediant]] (sixth degree) for minor keys. Thus [[F major]] ([[D minor]]) has one flat which is on the B; then [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]] ([[G minor]]) has two flats (on B and E) and so on.

Put another way: for key signatures with sharps, the first sharp is placed on F with subsequent sharps on C, G, D, A, E and B; for key signatures with flats, the first flat is placed on B with subsequent flats on E, A, D, G, C and F. There are thus 15 conventional key signatures, with up to seven sharps or flats and including the ''empty'' signature of C major (A minor).

Corollaries:

* Starting from a key with flats in its key signature: raising by fifths successively reduces the flats to zero at C major (A minor). Further such raising adds sharps as described above.
* Starting from a key with sharps: lowering by fifths successively reduces those sharps to zero. Further such lowering adds flats as described above.
* When the process of raising by a fifth (adding a sharp) produces more than five or six sharps, successive such raising generally involves changing to the [[enharmonic equivalent]] key using a flat-based signature. Typically this is at F{{music|sharp}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;G{{music|flat}}, but may also be at C{{music|sharp}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;D{{music|flat}} or B&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;C{{music|flat}}. The same principle applies to the process of successive lowering by a fifth.

The relative minor is a [[minor third]] down from the major, regardless of whether it is a ''flat'' or a ''sharp'' key signature.

The key signatures with seven flats ({{Music|flat}}) and seven sharps ({{Music|sharp}}) are rarely used because they have simpler enharmonic equivalents. For example, the key of [[C-sharp major|C{{music|#}} major]] (seven sharps) is more simply represented as [[D-flat major|D{{music|b}} major]] (five flats). For modern practical purposes these keys are (in twelve tone [[equal temperament]]) the same, because C{{music|#}} and D{{music|b}} are enharmonically the same note. Pieces ''are'' written in these ''extreme'' sharp or flat keys, however: for example, [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s Prelude and Fugue No. 3 from Book 1 of [[The Well-Tempered Clavier]] [[List of compositions of Johann Sebastian Bach#The Well-Tempered Clavier .28846.E2.80.93893.29|BWV 848]] is in C{{music|#}} major. The modern musical ''[[Seussical]]'' by [[Stephen Flaherty|Flaherty]] and [[Lynn Ahrens|Ahrens]] also has several songs written in these extreme keys.

Key signatures can be further extended through [[double sharp]]s and [[double flat]]s (for example, a piece in the key of G{{music|#}} major can be expressed with a double sharp on F{{music|x}} and six sharps on the other six pitches). As with the seven-sharp and seven-flat examples, it is rarely necessary to express music in such keys when simpler enharmonic examples can instead be used (in the case of G{{music|#}}, the same passage could be expressed in A{{music|b}} with only four flats).

[[File:Natural key signature example.png|thumb|Natural key signature: a key signature with seven [[Natural (music)|naturals]] ({{Music|natural}}) used to cancel the seven sharps ({{Music|sharp}}) of the previous signature.]]
The key signature may be changed at any time in a piece, usually at the beginning of a [[measure (music)|measure]], simply by notating the new signature, although if the new signature has no sharps or flats, a signature of naturals, as shown, is needed to cancel the preceding signature. If a change in signature occurs at the start of a new line on the page, where a signature would normally appear anyway, the new signature is customarily repeated at the end of the previous line to make the change more conspicuous.

=== Variants of standard conventions ===

In traditional use, when the key signature change goes from sharps to flats or vice versa, the old key signature is cancelled with the appropriate number of naturals before the new one is inserted; but many more recent publications (whether of newer music or newer editions of older music) dispense with the naturals and simply insert the new signature.

Similarly, when a signature with either flats or sharps in it changes to a smaller signature of the same type, strict application of tradition or convention would require that naturals first be used to cancel just those flats or sharps that are being subtracted in the new signature before the new signature itself is written; but, again, more modern usage often dispenses with these naturals.

When the signature changes from a smaller to a larger signature of the same type, the new signature is simply written in by itself, in both traditional and newer styles.

At one time it was usual to precede the new signature with a [[barline|double barline]] (provided the change occurred between bars and not inside a bar), even if it was not required by the structure of the music to mark sections within the movement; but more recently it has increasingly become usual to use just a single barline. The courtesy signature that appears at the end of a line immediately before a change is usually preceded by an additional barline; the line at the very end of the staff is omitted in this case.

If both naturals and a new key signature appear at a key signature change, there are also more recently variations about where a barline will be placed (in the case where the change occurs between bars). For example, in some scores by Debussy, in this situation the barline is placed after the naturals but before the new key signature. Hitherto, it would have been more usual to place all the symbols after the barline.

In key signatures of five or more sharps or of seven flats, one occasionally encounters variant positions of particular symbols in the key signatures, both of them in the bass clef.

The A{{music|sharp}} which is the fifth sharp in the sharp signatures may occasionally be notated on the top line of the bass staff, whereas it is more usually found in the lowest space on that staff. An example of this can be seen in the full score of [[Ottorino Respighi]]'s ''[[Pines of Rome]]'', in the third section, "Pines of the Janiculum" (which is in [[B major]]), in the bass-clef instrumental parts.

In the case of seven-flat key signatures, the final F{{music|flat}} may occasionally be seen on the second-top line of the bass staff, whereas it would more usually appear below the bottom line. An example of this can be seen in [[Isaac Albéniz]]'s ''[[Iberia (Albéniz)|Iberia]]'': first movement, "Evocación", which is in [[A-flat minor|A{{music|flat}}]] minor.

==Major scale structure==
Except for C major, key signatures appear in two varieties, "sharp key signatures" ("sharp keys") and "flat key signatures" ("flat keys"), so called because they contain only one or other.&lt;ref name="Schonbrun"&gt;Schonbrun, Marc (2005). ''The Everything Music Theory Book'', p.68. {{ISBN|1-59337-652-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scales with sharp key signatures===

Sharp key signatures consist of a number of sharps between one and seven, applied in this order: {{nowrap|F C G D A E B}}.&lt;ref name="Bower"&gt;Bower, Michael. 2007.

"Key-Signature". ''Oxford Dictionary of Music'', second edition, associate editor, Joyce Bourne. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-869162-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one sharp (F{{music|sharp}}) in the key signature of a piece in a major key indicates the key of G major, the next note above F{{music|sharp}}. (Six sharps, the last one being E{{music|sharp}} (an [[enharmonic]] spelling of F{{music|natural}}) indicate the key of F{{music|sharp}} major, since F has already been sharped in the key signature.)

This table shows that each scale starting on the [[Perfect fifth|fifth]] [[scale degree]] of the previous scale has one new sharp, added in the order given above.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;

===Scales with flat key signatures===
"Flat key signatures" consist of one to seven flats, applied as: {{nowrap|B E A D G C F}}&lt;ref name="Bower"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt; The mnemonic device is then reversed for use in the flat keys: "Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles' Father".&lt;ref name="Schonbrun"/&gt; The major scale with one flat is F major. In all other "flat major scales", the tonic or key note of a piece in a major key is four notes below the last flat, which is the same as the second-to-last flat in the signature.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt; In the major key with four flats (B{{music|flat}} E{{music|flat}} A{{music|flat}} D{{music|flat}}), for example, the penultimate flat is A{{music|flat}}, indicating a key of A{{music|flat}} major.

In this case each new scale starts a fifth ''below'' (or a [[Perfect fourth|fourth]] above) the previous one.

== Relationship between ''key signature'' and ''key'' ==

A key signature is not the same as a [[key (music)|key]]; key signatures are merely notational devices. They are convenient principally for [[diatonic]] or [[tonality|tonal]] music.

The key signature defines the [[diatonic scale]] that a piece of music uses without the need for accidentals. Most [[scale (music)|scales]] require that some notes be consistently sharped or flatted. For example, the only sharp in the G [[major scale]] is F sharp, so the key signature associated with the G major key is the one-sharp key signature. However, it is only a notational convenience; a piece with a one-sharp key signature is not necessarily in the key of G major, and likewise, a piece in G major may not always be written with a one-sharp key signature; this is particularly true in pre-Baroque music, when the concept of key had not yet evolved to its present state.

In any case, more extensive pieces often change key (''[[modulation (music)|modulate]]'') during contrasting sections, and only sometimes is this change indicated with a change of key signature; if not, the passage in the second key will not have a matching key signature.

[[File:GottesZeit.png|400px|thumb|right|[[Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit, BWV 106|Bach Cantata 106]] is almost entirely in E{{music|flat}} major, but has only two flats, not three, in the key signature {{audio|GottesZeit.mid|Play}}]]

The [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 538]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] has no key signature, leading it to be called the ''[[Dorian mode|Dorian]]'', but it is still in D minor; the B{{music|flat}}s that occur in the piece are written with accidentals.

===Additional terminology===
Keys which are associated with the same key signature are called [[relative minor/major|relative keys]].

When [[musical mode]]s, such as [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] or Dorian, are written using key signatures, they are called ''transposed modes''.

== Exceptions ==&lt;!--[[Unusual key signature]] redirects directly here.--&gt;

[[File:D Freygish Noteworthy Composer.png|thumb|D [[Phrygian dominant scale|Freygish]] scale {{audio|D Freygish.mid|Play}}]]

Exceptions to [[Common practice period|common-practice-period]] use may be found in [[Klezmer]] scales, such as [[Phrygian dominant scale|Freygish (Phrygian)]]. In the 20th century, composers such as [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] and [[Frederic Rzewski|Rzewski]] (see below) began experimenting with unusual key signatures that departed from the [[musical mode|standard order]].

Because of the limitations of the traditional [[Great Highland Bagpipe|highland bagpipe]] scale, key signatures are often omitted from written pipe music, which otherwise would be written with two sharps, the usual 
F{{music|#}} and C{{music|#}}.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In this case the pipes are incapable of playing F{{music|natural}} and C{{music|natural}} so it is not necessary to specify the sharps.)

[[File:Earlykeysig.png|thumb|right|80px|Variant key signatures in a [[Tomas Luis de Victoria|Victoria]] motet. In the ''superius'' (soprano) part the E{{music|flat}} appears first, and in two other parts a flat occurs in two octaves.]]

=== Unusual signatures ===
{{further information|Anhemitonic scale#Modes of the ancohemitonic heptatonic scales and the key signature system}}

The above 15 key signatures only express diatonic scale. and are therefore sometimes called ''standard key signatures''. Other scales are written either with a standard key signature and use accidental as required, or with a nonstandard key signature. Examples of the latter include the E{{music|b}} (right hand), and F{{music|b}} and G{{music|b}} (left hand) used for the E{{music|b}} diminished (E{{music|b}} [[octatonic scale|octatonic]]) scale in Bartók's ''Crossed Hands'' (no. 99, vol. 4, ''[[Mikrokosmos (Béla Bartók)|Mikrokosmos]]''), or the B{{music|b}}, E{{music|b}} and F{{music|#}}&lt;!--yes, sharp--&gt; used for the D [[Phrygian dominant scale]] in [[Frederic Rzewski]]'s ''God to a Hungry Child''.

The absence of a key signature does not always mean that the music is in the key of C major&amp;nbsp;/ A minor as each accidental may be notated explicitly as required, or the piece may be [[Musical mode|modal]] or [[atonality|atonal]]. An example is Bartók's [[Piano Sonata (Bartók)|Piano Sonata]], which has no fixed key and is highly chromatic.

If not bound by common practice conventions, [[microtonal music|microtones]] can also be notated in a key signature; which [[List of musical symbols#Quarter tones|microtonal symbols]] are used depends on the system.

The [[common practice period]] conventions are so firmly established that some [[scorewriter|musical notation programs]] have been unable to show nonstandard key signatures until recently.&lt;ref&gt;One of the most popular musical notation programs, Finale, has only included the option to create a nonstandard key signature since their 2009 version: Finale 2009 User Manual for Windows. "Non-Standard Key Signature." http://www.finalemusic.com/UserManuals/Finale2009Win/Finale.htm (accessed February 17, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The use of a one-flat signature developed in the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] period, but signatures with more than one flat did not appear until the 16th century, and signatures with sharps not until the mid-17th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Key Signature", ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

When signatures with multiple flats first came in, the order of the flats was not standardized, and often a flat appeared in two different octaves, as shown at right. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, it was common for different voice parts in the same composition to have different signatures, a situation called a '''partial signature''' or '''conflicting signature'''. This was actually more common than complete signatures in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Partial Signature", ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The 16th-century motet ''Absolon fili mi'' attributed to [[Josquin des Prez]] features two voice parts with two flats, one part with three flats, and one part with four flats.

Baroque music written in [[minor key]]s often was written with a key signature with fewer flats than we now associate with their keys; for example, movements in C minor often had only two flats (because the A{{music|flat}} would frequently have to be sharpened to A{{music|natural}} in the [[minor scale|ascending melodic minor scale]], as would the B{{music|flat}}).

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==
This technique has been used for years in the management and disposal of [[drill cuttings]], oily sludge and other [[gasoline|petroleum]] refinery wastes. The equipment employed in land farming is typical of that used in [[agriculture|agricultural]] operations. These land farming activities cultivate and enhance [[Microorganism|microbial]] degradation of hazardous compounds. As a rule of thumb, the higher the [[molecular weight]] (i.e., the more rings within a [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]), the slower the degradation rate. Also, the more [[chlorine|chlorinated]] or [[nitration|nitrated]] the compound, the more difficult it is to degrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Theodore|first=L|title=Introduction to Hazardous Waste Incineration|year=1987|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|author2=Reynolds, J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Factors that may limit the applicability and effectiveness of the process include:

#large space requirements
#the conditions advantageous for biological degradation of contaminants are largely uncontrolled, which increases the required length of time until complete degradation, particularly for recalcitrant compounds
#inorganic contaminants are not biodegraded
#the potential of large amounts of [[particulates|particulate matter]] released by operations
#the presence of metal ions may be toxic to microbes and may leach from the contaminated soil into the ground.

Hydrocarbon compounds that have been identified as being not readily degraded by land farming include [[creosote]], [[pentachlorophenol]] (PCP), and [[fuel oil#Bunker fuel|bunker C oil]].

The Lothian Birth Cohort studies are led by [[Ian Deary]], the director of the [[CCACE|Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]].

==Background==
The Lothian Birth Cohort (LBC) studies of 1921 (LBC1921) and 1936 (LBC1936) are follow-up studies of, respectively, the Scottish Mental Surveys (SMSs) of 1932 (SMS1932) and 1947 (SMS1947).&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; The Scottish Mental Surveys, which were undertaken by the [[Scottish Council for Research in Education]] (SCRE), are the only attempts to date of any country to measure the intelligence of a complete year-of-birth in its population.&lt;ref name="CCACE, 2015"&gt;CCACE (2015). The Scottish Mental Survey 1932 [web page]. Retrieved from http://www.lothianbirthcohort.ed.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=13&lt;/ref&gt; By following up SMS participants in old age, the LBC studies have been able to effectively investigate long-term cognitive ageing and cognitive epidemiology due to the availability of a measure of participants' childhood intelligence.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt;

The Moray House Test No. 12, designed by [[Godfrey Thomson]], was used in both Scottish Mental Surveys.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Impact of Childhood Intelligence on Later Life: Following Up the Scottish Mental Surveys of 1932 and 1947.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.86.1.130|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date = 1 January 2004|volume = 86|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.86.1.130|first = Ian J.|last = Deary|first2 = Martha C.|last2 = Whiteman|first3 = John M.|last3 = Starr|first4 = Lawrence J.|last4 = Whalley|first5 = Helen C.|last5 = Fox|pages=130–147|pmid=14717632}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a valid intelligence test&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt; that consists of 75 items of a variety of types including: following directions; word classification; analogies; practical items; reasoning; arithmetic; and spatial items.&lt;ref name="Scottish Council for Research in Education, 1933 cited in Deary et al., 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Stability of Individual Differences in Mental Ability from Childhood to Old Age: Follow-up of the 1932 Scottish Mental Survey|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289699000318|journal = Intelligence|date = 1 February 2000|pages = 49–55|volume = 28|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(99)00031-8|first = Ian J|last = Deary|first2 = Lawrence J|last2 = Whalley|first3 = Helen|last3 = Lemmon|first4 = J.

===Scottish Mental Surveys of 1932 and 1947===
The SMS1932 was funded by the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Corporation]] as part of the International Examination Inquiry.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A conversation between Charles Spearman, Godfrey Thomson, and Edward L.

The SMS1947 was commissioned to test the theory that average intelligence in the United Kingdom was lower in the new generation due to a negative [[correlation]] between family size and the intelligence of children.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt; It was carried out on 4 June 1947, and tested the intelligence of 70,805 children, nearly all of Scotland's 1936-born population.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Lothian Birth Cohort 1936: a study to examine influences on cognitive ageing from age 11 to age 70 and beyond|url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2318/7/28/abstract|journal = BMC Geriatrics|date = 5 December 2007|issn = 1471-2318|pmc = 2222601|pmid = 18053258|pages = 28|volume = 7|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/1471-2318-7-28|first = Ian J.|last = Deary|first2 = Alan J.|last2 = Gow|first3 = Michelle D.|last3 = Taylor|first4 = Janie|last4 = Corley|first5 = Caroline|last5 = Brett|first6 = Valerie|last6 = Wilson|first7 = Harry|last7 = Campbell|first8 = Lawrence J.|last8 = Whalley|first9 = Peter M.|last9 = Visscher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data rediscovery===
The SMS data was rediscovered by Ian Deary and [[Lawrence Whalley]] in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Deary, 2012"&gt;Deary, I. J. (2012). ''An Intelligent Scotland: Professor Sir Godfrey Thomson and the Scottish Mental Surveys'' [Lecture recording]. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVGICGmdLiY&lt;/ref&gt; The data had been in the [[Moray House School of Education#Charteris Land|Charteris Land]] building of the Moray House School of Education at the University of Edinburgh, which was being rented by the SCRE.&lt;ref name="Deary, 2012" /&gt; Recruitment for the [[Aberdeen]] area-based follow-up studies of the Scottish Mental Surveys, the Aberdeen Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936, began in 1997 and 1999 respectively.&lt;ref name="Whalley et al., 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How the 1932 and 1947 mental surveys of Aberdeen schoolchildren provide a framework to explore the childhood origins of late onset disease and disability|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2011.05.010|journal = Maturitas|date = 1 January 2011|volume = 69|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2011.05.010|first = Lawrence J.|last = Whalley|first2 = Alison D.|last2 = Murray|first3 = Roger T.|last3 = Staff|first4 = John M.|last4 = Starr|first5 = Ian J.|last5 = Deary|first6 = Helen C.|last6 = Fox|first7 = Helen|last7 = Lemmon|first8 = Susan J.|last8 = Duthie|first9 = Andrew R.|last9 = Collins|pages=365–372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and aims==
A core aim of the LBC studies is to explore causes of different cognitive ageing outcomes.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; They have also been used to facilitate a variety of psychosocial, medical and genetic investigations.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt;

Each wave of data collection typically includes: cognitive tests; socio-demographic information; health behaviours and health status; fitness measures; and physical measures.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; Metabolic and inflammatory [[Biomarker (medicine)|biomarkers]] have also been taken in both cohorts.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; The studies have been funded by a variety of sources, including but not limited to the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]], the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]], the Scottish Government's [[Chief Scientist Office (Scotland)|Chief Scientist Office]], [[Age UK]] and [[Research into Ageing]].&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt;

===Lothian Birth Cohort 1921===
LBC1921 participant recruitment began in 1999.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt; Participants were mainly recruited by tracing SMS1932 participants in the Edinburgh area using the [[National Health Service Central Register#Community Health Index|Community Health Index]] (CHI), and then asking general practitioners to contact the traced potential LBC participants.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt;

The LBC1921 study's main initial aim was to find molecular genetic markers of healthy cognitive ageing.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; This included the investigation of the influence of the E4 [[allele]] on the [[Apolipoprotein E]] (''APOE'') gene on cognitive ageing as well as testing the effects of other [[candidate gene]]s for cognitive ageing.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; A later research focus was examining relationships involving [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) from genes linked to [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; The third and fourth waves of data collection were conducted with the main objective of testing the common cause hypothesis of cognitive ageing,&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; which puts forward that age-related declines in physical and cognitive functioning share a common cause.&lt;ref name="Christensen et al., 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The "common cause hypothesis" of cognitive aging: Evidence for not only a common factor but also specific associations of age with vision and grip strength in a cross-sectional analysis.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0882-7974.16.4.588|journal = Psychology and Aging|date = 1 January 2001|volume = 16|issue = 4|doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.16.4.588|first = Helen|last = Christensen|first2 = Andrew J.|last2 = Mackinnon|first3 = Ailsa|last3 = Korten|first4 = Anthony F.|last4 = Jorm|pages=588–599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lothian Birth Cohort 1936===
LBC1936 participant recruitment started in 2004.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2007" /&gt; Potential participants were identified using the CHI and then sent a letter about the study from the Lothian Health Board.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2007" /&gt;

The LBC1936 study began with the wider objective of investigating a diverse range of influences on cognitive ageing, including the effects of economic, medical, psychological and social variables.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; For Wave 2, a specific focus was placed on finding how the white matter of the brain becomes damaged and what relationship white matter damage has with age-related cognitive decline.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wardlaw et al., 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Brain aging, cognition in youth and old age and vascular disease in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936: rationale, design and methodology of the imaging protocol*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-4949.2011.00683.x/abstract|journal = International Journal of Stroke|date = 1 December 2011|issn = 1747-4949|pages = 547–559|volume = 6|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1747-4949.2011.00683.x|first = Joanna M.|last = Wardlaw|first2 = Mark E.|last2 = Bastin|first3 = Maria C.|last3 = Valdés Hernández|first4 = Susana Muñoz|last4 = Maniega|first5 = Natalie A.|last5 = Royle|first6 = Zoe|last6 = Morris|first7 = Jonathan D.|last7 = Clayden|first8 = Elaine M.|last8 = Sandeman|first9 = Elizabeth|last9 = Eadie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
As well as being used to research the topics of major findings outlined below, LBC data has been used in a diverse range of other investigations.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; For example, LBC1921 participants served as a [[control group]] in a study that validated of the use of the [[National Adult Reading Test]] as a measure of [[Morbidity|premorbid]] cognition in individuals with [[dementia]].&lt;ref name="McGurn et al., 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pronunciation of irregular words is preserved in dementia, validating premorbid IQ estimation|url = http://www.neurology.org/content/62/7/1184|journal = Neurology|date = 13 April 2004|issn = 0028-3878|pmid = 15079021|pages = 1184–1186|volume = 62|issue = 7|doi = 10.1212/01.WNL.0000103169.80910.8B|first = B.|last = McGurn|first2 = J.

===Stability of intelligence===
[[File:Longitudinal correlations of Moray House Test scores in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1921.png|alt=In the LBC1921, age 11 Moray House Test scores correlated .66, .51 and .55 with scores at ages 79, 87 and 90 respectively. Age 79 scores correlated .7 with age 87 scores and .73 with age 90 scores. Age 87 scores correlated .87 with age 90 scores.|thumb|Path diagram of raw correlations&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gow et al., 2011" /&gt; (displayed on the double-headed arrows) between Moray House Test scores at different ages (displayed within square boxes) in the LBC1921.]]

Studies of the LBC1921 have provided the longest-term estimates of the stability of intelligence.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2013" /&gt; They have found that intelligence in childhood is [[Effect size#Pearson r or correlation coefficient|strongly correlated]] with intelligence in old age, and that this correlation exists because intelligence is highly stable trait, rather than because childhood intelligence is linked to rates of cognitive change during adulthood.

The LBC1921 took the Moray House Test at ages 11, 79, 87 and 90, and results at all four sittings were strongly correlated. The raw correlations between test scores at age 11 and at ages 79, 87 and 90 were .66, .51 and .55 respectively, and they rose to .73, .61 and .67 respectively after correction for the restriction of [[Range (statistics)|range]] in the LBC1921 sample.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gow et al., 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Stability and change in intelligence from age 11 to ages 70, 79, and 87: The Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0021072|journal = Psychology and Aging|date = 1 January 2011|volume = 26|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/a0021072|first = Alan J.|last = Gow|first2 = Wendy|last2 = Johnson|first3 = Alison|last3 = Pattie|first4 = Caroline E.|last4 = Brett|first5 = Beverly|last5 = Roberts|first6 = John M.|last6 = Starr|first7 = Ian J.|last7 = Deary|pages=232–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range restriction-corrected correlation coefficients represent the best estimate of the stability of intelligence across the entire population of SMS1932 participants, and indicate that intelligence is a very stable trait.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2013" /&gt; Even the corrected coefficients may underestimate the strength of the correlation, as the [[Test-retest reliability|reliability]] of the test is likely below 1.0.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt;

Although age 11 intelligence is related to old age intelligence, it has been reported to be unrelated to change in intelligence between ages 79 and 87 in the LBC1921.&lt;ref name="Gow et al., 2011" /&gt; This finding suggested that childhood intelligence is related to old age intelligence because of the stability of intelligence rather than because it protects against decline in old age.&lt;ref name="Gow et al., 2011" /&gt;
 
The LBC1936 also re-sat the Moray House Test in old age. In this larger cohort, there was a strong correlation between scores at ages 11 and 70 of .67.&lt;ref name="Gow et al., 2011" /&gt;

===Genetic associations===
[[File:PBB Protein APOE.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Apolipoprotein E.|Apolipoprotein E.]]

The most consistent genetic finding from the LBC studies has been that the E4 allele on the ''APOE'' gene, which had previously been known to be a risk factor for late-onset [[Alzheimer's disease]],&lt;ref name="Corder et al., 1993"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gene dose of apolipoprotein E type 4 allele and the risk of Alzheimer's disease in late onset families|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/261/5123/921|journal = Science|date = 13 August 1993|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 8346443|pages = 921–923|volume = 261|issue = 5123|doi = 10.1126/science.8346443|first = E.

D.|last7 = Roses|first8 = J. L.|last8 = Haines|first9 = M. A.|last9 = Pericak-Vance}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also adversely linked to non-pathological cognitive function and change.

In an early LBC1921 study, E4 allele status was unrelated to Moray House Test scores at age 11, but at age 80 those with an E4 allele scored lower than those without an E4 allele, indicating that the allele is a risk factor for cognitive decline.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2002" /&gt; Later LBC1921 research found that possession of the E4 allele was associated with greater decline in abstract reasoning and verbal memory, but not verbal fluency, between age 79 and age 87.&lt;ref name="Schiepers et al., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schiepers O.

[[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association (GWA) studies]] have confirmed the ''APOE'' E4 allele's association with worse cognitive decline and function. A GWA study of longitudinal cohorts, including the LBC1921 and the LBC1936, found that the ''APOE'' E4 allele was associated with deleterious cognitive change.&lt;ref name="Davies et al., 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Davies G. |author2=Harris S.

Data from both cohorts was also used, in combination with other data, to establish that intelligence is highly [[Polygene|polygenic]].&lt;ref name="Davies et al., 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Davies G. |author2=Tenesa A. |author3=Payton A. |author4=Yang J. |author5=Harris S.

Lothian Birth Cohort data has also been a part of GWA studies for various medical outcomes including cancer, stroke, lung function, arterial pressure and platelet formation.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt;

===White matter integrity===

[[File:3DSlicer-KubickiJPR2007-fig6.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The structure of the white matter of the human brain.|The structure of the white matter of the human brain.]]

Structural [[magnetic resonance imaging]] brain scans from LBC1936 participants have been used to observe that the integrity of white matter tracts in the brain is linked to cognitive functioning and successful cognitive ageing. In one study, three general [[Factor analysis|factors]] of white matter tract integrity combined to explain 10% of the variance in general intelligence, and this effect was fully [[Mediation (statistics)|mediated]] through processing speed.&lt;ref name="Penke et al., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Penke L. |author2=Maniega S.

White matter integrity has also been shown to relate to cognitive change. Specifically, white matter integrity in the [[splenium]] of the corpus callosum has been found to be a marker of healthy cognitive ageing.&lt;ref name="Penke et al., 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Penke L. |author2=Maniega S.

Additionally, white matter integrity in some brain areas has been found to be weaker in ''APOE'' E4 allele carriers,&lt;ref name="Lyall et al., 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lyall D.

===Health, health behaviours and cognitive ageing===

In the LBC1921, smoking was linked to greater cognitive decline at age 80.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deary I. J. |author2=Pattie A. |author3=Taylor M.

Physical fitness, indexed by a general [[Principal component analysis|component]] extracted from measures of lung function, grip strength and walk time, was associated with successful cognitive ageing at age 79 in the LBC1921.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deary I.

One of the strengths of the LBC study designs is that they enable tests of [[reverse causation]] in associations between intelligence and other variables. Reverse causation is implied if a contemporaneous association in old age is attenuated or eliminated after childhood intelligence is controlled for, which would suggest that the association existed partially or wholly due to the effects of earlier intelligence.

{{homicide}}
 
A '''lust murder''' is a [[homicide]] in which the offender searches for erotic satisfaction by killing someone. ''Lust murder'' is synonymous with the [[paraphilic]] term '''erotophonophilia''', which is [[sexual arousal]] or gratification contingent on the death of a human being. The phrase "lust killing" stems from the original work of [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] in his 1898 discussion of [[sexual sadism|sadistic]] homicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Homicide: A Psychiatric Perspective|last = Malmquist|first = Carl P.|publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc.|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, this type of crime is manifested either by murder during [[sexual activity]], by [[Mutilation|mutilating]] the [[sexual organ]]s or areas of the victim's body, or by murder and mutilation. The mutilation of the victim may include [[Disembowelment|evisceration]], displacement of the sexual organs, or both.&lt;ref name="aggrawal"&gt;{{cite book | first=Anil | last=Aggrawal | coauthors= | title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices | publisher=[[CRC Press]] | location=Boca Raton | year=2009 | isbn=1-4200-4308-0 |url=http://crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781420043082}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mutilation usually takes place postmortem.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010" /&gt; Although the killing sequence may include an act of sexual intercourse, sexual intercourse does not always occur, and other types of sexual acts may be part of the homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Homicide: A Psychiatric Perspective|last = Malmquist|first = Carl P.|publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc.|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Characteristics==
Lust murder sometimes includes activities such as removing clothing from the body, posing and propping of the body in different positions (generally sexual ones), insertion of objects into bodily orifices, [[Cannibalism|anthropophagy]] (the consumption of human blood and/or flesh) and [[necrophilia]] (the performing of sex acts on a human corpse).

Most cases of lust murder involve male perpetrators, although accounts of female lust murderers do exist.&lt;ref name="Female_Lust_Kill"&gt;{{cite news|title=When Women Kill Together. |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1613/is_1_16/ai_n29335603/ |work=The Forensic Examiner |publisher=American College of Forensic Examiners Institute (ACFEI) |date=2007-03-22 |accessdate=2009-08-08 |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829110653/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1613/is_1_16/ai_n29335603/ |archivedate=2010-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, lust murder is a phenomenon most common among [[serial killers]]. These offenders have made a connection between murder and sexual gratification. When this type of offender chooses a victim there must be something about that victim that the offender finds sexually attractive. This attractive trait might be common among all of the offender's victims and is called the offender's Ideal Victim Type (IVT). There might be many potential targets that an offender passes by because they do not meet their IVT. Once the offender has found a victim who is ideal, they might engage in stalking or other predatory behaviors before acting out their fantasy on their victim. Fantasies are a key component in lust murders and can never be completely fulfilled. The lust killer will have a fantasy that continues to evolve over time and becomes increasingly violent as they struggle to fulfill it.&lt;ref name="Holmes &amp; Holmes"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Ronald | last1=Holmes | first2= Stephen | last2=Holmes | title=Serial Murder (3rd edition) | publisher=[[Sage Publications]] | location=Thousand Oaks, CA | year=2010 | pages=107–121 |isbn=978-1-4129-7442-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most critical component in the psychological development of a serial killer is violent fantasy, especially in the lust murderer.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010"&gt;Hickey, Eric W. (2010). Serial Murderers and Their Victims (5th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasies accompany "intrusive thoughts about killing someone that are associated with other distressing [[psychopathological]] processes".&lt;ref&gt;Crabb, Peter B. (2000). The Material Culture of Homicidal Fantasies. Aggressive Behavior, 26, 225-234&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasies can never be completely fulfilled; sometimes the experience of killing can generate new fantasies of violence, creating a repetitive cycle. The purpose of fantasy is total control of the victim, whereas a [[sexual assault]] can be used as a vehicle for control. Sexual [[torture]] becomes a tool to degrade, humiliate, and subjugate the victim.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010"/&gt; Often victims are selected by the killer to stand as a proxy, resulting from childhood trauma. Fantasies may be fueled by pornography and facilitated by alcohol or other causes.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010"/&gt; Typically, fantasies involve one or several forms of [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref name="Holmes &amp; Holmes"/&gt;

The term ''lust murder'' is also used in a related, but slightly different sense, to refer to an individual who gains ''[[sexual arousal]]'' from the act of committing murder, or has persistent ''[[sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]]'' of committing murder, even if the murder itself does not involve the genital mutilation or other aforementioned characteristics. As such, it is a type of [[paraphilia]].

Although the dynamic of violent fantasy in lust murders is understood, an individual's violence fantasy alone is not enough to determine if an individual has or has not engaged in lust murder. Moreover, to conclude that an individual is the murderer because they have drawn multitudes of violent images is overreaching.&lt;ref&gt;Perri, Frank S. and Lichtenwald, Terrance G. (2009). “[http://www.all-about-forensic-psychology.com/support-files/criminal-profiling.pdf When Worlds Collide: Criminal Investigative Analysis, Forensic Psychology And the Timothy Masters Case].” Forensic Examiner, 18:2 NCJ # 226972&lt;/ref&gt; The Perri and Lichtenwald article illustrates the critical importance of homicide detectives employing the Criminal Investigative Analysis model developed by Roy Hazelwood FBI (ret.), profiler and one of the top researchers in the field of lust murders.

The '''Master of Management''' ('''MM''', '''MBM''','''MIM''', '''MMgt''') is a post-graduate [[master’s degree]] awarded to students who normally complete a one- to two-year program of graduate level coursework in [[business management]] at an accredited academic institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: A school is “a building that has four walls…with tomorrow inside”: Toward the reinvention of the business school | doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.03.010 | journal=Business Horizons}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the program is designed for students interested in entering leadership roles, the degree attracts applicants from diverse academic disciplines. The MM program structure is similar to that of the [[Master of Business Administration]], Master of Arts in Management, and [[Master of Science in Management]] degrees.

==Program structure==
The MM structure varies from program to program, but typically adheres to the rigor of [[Management science]]. The mode delivery of the program can be full-time,  part-time, distance-learning, accelerated, or executive. 

The MM program for younger professionals with limited professional experience often resembles an [[master of business administration|MBA program]]. It typically prepares students to handle management issues in all areas of business with the option to concentrate or specialize in one area. Most programs begin with a set of required courses and then offer more specialized courses two thirds of the way through the program.  Topics in the MM program often include those listed aside, while concentrations may focus on [[accounting]], [[finance]], [[business administration]], [[international business]]/global management, [[marketing management]], [[supply chain management]], [[human resources]], [[Nonprofit studies|nonprofit management]], and [[entrepreneurship]].  

The MM program for senior professionals with managerial experience (typically 10+ years) often resembles an Executive MBA (EMBA) program. It typically prepares students to handle the tasks associated with interdisciplinary business-related subjects such as ethical decision making, [[business law]], global business values, workplace security, [[corporate crime]], and employee motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Montauk|title=How to Get Into the Top MBA Programs, 5th Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkSp1hHOkPUC&amp;pg=PT48|year=2010|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-7352-0450-8|pages=48+}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs focuses on helping entry and mid level managers improve their management practice with cultural competence that enable them to function across England, Canada, India, China and Brazil.

==Admissions==
Business school admission committees normally evaluate applicants based on [[bachelor degree]] and [[GPA]] score (and graduate GPA if applicable), detailed resume, letters of recommendation, essays, and personal interviews. Based on these indicators, the committee decides if the applicant is suitable for the academic profile of the program, can demonstrate considerable leadership potential, and contribute positively to the student body of the school as a whole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5753">'''Mismatch loss''' in [[transmission line]] theory is the amount of power expressed in [[decibels]] that will not be available on the output due to impedance mismatches and [[Reflections of signals on conducting lines|signal reflections]].  A transmission line that is properly terminated, that is, terminated with the same impedance as that of the [[characteristic impedance]] of the transmission line, will have no reflections and therefore no mismatch loss.  Mismatch loss represents the amount of power wasted in the system.  It can also be thought of as the amount of power gained if the system was perfectly matched.  [[Impedance matching]] is an important part of RF system design; however, in practice there will likely be some degree of mismatch loss.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, David J. (2004). Ground penetrating radar (2nd Edition).  Institution of Engineering and Technology. {{ISBN|978-0-86341-360-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In real systems, relatively little loss is due to mismatch loss and is often on the order of 1dB.

== Calculation ==
Mismatch loss (ML) is the ratio of incident power to the difference between incident and reflected power:

[[File:T line img.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 1. Simple circuit showing characteristic impedance Z&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; and the load impedance Z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. In a perfectly matched system Z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;=Z&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, and there is no mismatch loss.]]

:&lt;math&gt;
ML_\mathrm{dB} = 10 \log_{10} \bigg(\frac{P_i}{P_i-P_r}\bigg) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
P_r=P_i - P_d\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; = incident power&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P_r&lt;/math&gt; = reflected power&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P_d&lt;/math&gt; = delivered power (also called the ''accepted power'')

The fraction of incident power delivered to the load is

[[File:T line img2.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 2. Simple circuit showing incident power, P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, on a load. The reflected power will be the difference between P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and the power delivered, P&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{P_d}{P_i}=1-\rho^2
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
where
&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the [[reflection coefficient]].  Note that as the reflection coefficient approaches zero, power to the load is maximized.

If the reflection coefficient is known, mismatch can be calculated by&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
ML_\mathrm{dB} = - 10 \log_{10} \bigg(1-\rho^2\bigg) \,
&lt;/math&gt;
In terms of the voltage standing wave ratio ([[VSWR]]):

:&lt;math&gt;
ML_\mathrm{dB} = - 10 \log_{10} \bigg(1-\bigg(\frac{VSWR-1}{VSWR+1}\bigg)^2\bigg) \,
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Lo YT and Lee SW 1988 Antenna handbook: Theory, Applications, and Design&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of mismatch loss==

Any component of the transmission line that has an input and output will contribute to the overall mismatch loss of the system.  For example, in mixers mismatch loss occurs when there is an impedance mismatch between the RF port and IF port of the mixer.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Joseph J. (2002). RF components and circuits.  Oxford: Newnes. {{ISBN|0-7506-4844-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the principal reasons for losses in mixers.  Likewise, a large amount of the loss in [[amplifiers]] comes from the mismatch between the input and output.  Consequently, not all of the available power generated by the amplifier gets transferred to the load.&lt;ref&gt;Skolnik, Merrill I. (2001). Introduction to radar systems (3rd Edition).  New York: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-288138-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is most important in antenna systems where mismatch loss in the transmitting and receiving antenna directly contributes to the losses the system—including the system [[noise figure]].  Other common RF system components such as [[Filter (signal processing)|filters]], [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]]s, [[power splitter|splitter]]s, and [[combiner]]s will generate some amount of mismatch loss.  While completely eliminating mismatch loss in these components is near impossible, mismatch loss contributions by each component can be minimized by selecting quality components for use in a well designed system.

==Mismatch error==
&lt;ref&gt;White, Joseph F. (2004). High frequency techniques: An introduction to RF and microwave engineering.  Hoboken: Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-45591-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there are two or more components in cascade as is often the case, the resultant mismatch loss is not only due to the mismatches from the individual components, but also from how the reflections from each component combine with each other.  The overall mismatch loss cannot be calculated by just adding up the individual loss contributions from each component.  The difference between the sum of the mismatch loss in each component and total mismatch loss due to the interactions of the reflections is known as mismatch error.  Depending on how the multiple reflections combine, the overall system loss may be lower or higher than the sum of the mismatch loss from each component.  Mismatch error occurs in pairs as the signal reflects off of each mismatched component.  So for the example in Figure 3, there are mismatch errors generated by each pair of components.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, John N. (2004). Target detection by marine radar.  Institution of Engineering and Technology. {{ISBN|978-0-86341-359-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mismatch uncertainty increases as the frequency increases, and in wide-band applications.  The phasing of the reflections makes it particularly harder to model.

The general case for calculating mismatch error (ME) is:

[[File:T line img3.jpg|thumb|Figure 3. Simple circuit showing multiple reflections due to more than 1 mismatched device.]]

:&lt;math&gt;
ME_\mathrm{dB} = 20 \log_{10} \bigg(1-\rho_1\rho_2\,e^{-j2\theta}\bigg) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the complex phase change due to the second reflection

The '''National Wind Tunnel Facility''' (NWTF), is an initiative in which 17 [[wind tunnels]] distributed across seven UK universities (host institutions) are made open access (for up to 25% of time) to external researchers in the UK and abroad, from both university and industry based.&lt;ref&gt;The proposal funding details on the EPSRC website: http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPanel.aspx?PanelId=1-1O6B32&lt;/ref&gt; 

NWTF is intended to be as inclusive as possible while still  supporting the best science. The scheme was announced on 9 January 2014 by [[David Willetts]], Minister for Science and Universities.&lt;ref&gt;News of the opening by the minister David Willetts: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-25668025&lt;/ref&gt; The total funding for the Facility is £13.3 million, £10.7 million coming from [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|EPSRC]] and £2.6 million from the UK Aerospace Technology Institute.&lt;ref&gt; News of the opening on the ATI website: http://www.ati.org.uk/news/uk-aerodynamics-epsrc-fund-national-wind-tunnel-facility-nwtf/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The EPSRC and ATI decided to fund the NWTF in order to match the UK talent base to world-class wind tunnel facilities. The enhanced UK capability in experimental [[aerodynamics]] is available to all UK-based researchers.  The stated aim was to create nodes of excellence attracting young researchers. Another aim was to establish a closer tie with industry, creating a pull-through environment and an intended spill-over of the collaboration and benefits to other sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Details of the project: http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/L024888/1&lt;/ref&gt;

The NWTF programme was to have a duration of five years. A mid-term review was to review the progress made during the first two and a half years. The current end date is December 2018,

== Governance ==
The NWTF has a Management Board (MB) that meets approximately every 3 months. This is composed of a Principal Investigator from each of the current host institutions and the NWTF Project Manager. The current MB members are Professor Holger Babinsky ([[University of Cambridge]]), Professor Chris Atkin ([[City University London|City University]]), Professor Kevin Garry ([[Cranfield University]]), Dr Richard Green ([[University of Glasgow]]), Professor Jonathan Morrison ([[Imperial College London|Imperial College]]), Professor Peter Ireland ([[University of Oxford]]), Professor Bharathram Ganapathisubramani ([[University of Southampton]]) and Dr Kevin Gouder (NWTF Project Manager). A

n Advisory Board (AB) oversees the broader aims of the NWTF, monitors the running of the NWTF and reviews progress versus Key Performance Indicators. The AB is composed of representatives from EPSRC, ATI, senior academics (from the UK and abroad), representatives from industry, an existing National Facility Manager and is chaired by an independent senior UK-based aerodynamicist.

==Design==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] from design company John Doe designed Olli from the basic shape of a [[soccer ball]]. They believe the basic shape, size and character was part of Olli's success. This made Olli easily recognizable to audiences. Olli is drawn in a minimalist style, requiring only a few lines and one [[primary color]]. Olli was created in three sizes, one small size 4.7 in. one medium, size 11 in. and one big size 7.2&amp;nbsp;ft.

==Big Olli==
There are two big Olli's. They are the elder version of small Olli. The Big Olli's is a special creature model made for several charities. One is a permanent hard [[plastic]] [[polyester]] [[statue]] at the Sophia [[Children's hospital|Children's Hospital]] and another one has a temporarily place at the [[Rotterdam Zoo]]. The big Olli that is used in the short film to save the Rotterdam ZOO is stored at a secret location according to the creators.

==Fictional character biography==
Olli is toy elephant grown to the size of a real elephant. Olli is a lovable character with furry friends living in a [[Japan]]ese [[fantasy]] world. Later in 2013 there was a story added that he was also the favorite toy of Famous Soccer player [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]]. Together they are the main cast of a short film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fr12.nl/dump/9360-olli--amp--giovanni-van-bronckhorst.html
|title=Olli &amp; Giovanni van Bronckhorst|publisher=FR12|language=Dutch|date=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rotterdam, [[Netherlands]] of 1980, Giovanni van Bronckhorst is a little boy (played in the short film by the son of Giovanni van Bronckhorst). One day, he discovers a stuffed Elephant at the Rotterdam [[Zoo]] and immediately grows attached to it. The name of the elephant is Olli. Giovanni takes him everywhere he goes, especially when he plays soccer. One day during a soccer game, he loses Olli in the canal of Rotterdam. 28 years later in 2013, Giovanni became a Famous Soccer Player and trainer of soccer club [[Feyenoord]] and Olli, also grew big, reunite again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://christianneblogs.com/2013/03/21/olli-een-aaibare-briljante-reclame

==Background==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] have a history in creating things that help people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fabmagazine.nl/2014/03/wereldheerschappij-voor-rotterdamse-olli|title=Wereldheerschappij voor Rotterdamse Olli|publisher=FAB|language=Dutch|date=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To give something back to society and convince big brands to do so too. Olli was a few times part of a strategy they developed in 2004 and created Olli as a separate brand to generate [[awareness]] and in one campaign to generate more traffic and money for a [[ZOO]] in [[Rotterdam]].

== copyright infringement ==
In 2015 John Doe BV/Ollimania started a lawsuit against the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] insurance company [[ASR Nederland]] for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ie-forum.nl/?//ASR+mag+Olli-producten+na+afloop+licentieovereenkomst+blijven+uitleveren////34043/|title=John Doe BV Olli|publisher=IE Forum |date= 30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch [[Insurance]] company used illegally images and foto’s from Ollimania to sell insurances to their customers. The Dutch court ruled in favor of John Doe BV/ Ollimania and urged ASR Nederland to stop their [[copyright infringement]].
[[ASR Nederland]] had a license for a year on one of the Olli toys that expired in August 2014. The insurance company also kept 30.000 toys that were meant for the Rotterdam zoo to earn [[money]] to keep the [[ZOO]] open. [[ASR Nederland]] was entitled to keep the toys and distribute them however they see fit as long they would not infringe the copyrights of John Doe BV and Olli again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.ie-forum.nl/?//ASR+mag+Olli-producten+na+afloop+licentieovereenkomst+blijven+uitleveren////34043/|title=ASR en Olli|publisher=Reclameboek|date= 30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASR Nederland is the biggest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.slimmeropweg.nl/het-nieuwe-werken-stappenplan/gerelateerd-nieuws/item/asr-het-nieuwe-generatie-werken|title=Het nieuwe werken|publisher=Slimmer op weg|date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; insurance company of the Netherlands with almost 3000 [[employees]].

Oral sex is often regarded as [[taboo]],&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice.

==Practice==
[[File:Wiki-fellatio.png|thumb|Female performing fellatio]]
Oral sex may be practiced by people of any [[sexual orientation]].

===Sexual variants===
[[Facesitting]] is a form of oral sex in which the receiver sits on the giver's face and pushes into it with his or her genitals. Oral sex can also be performed by both partners at the same time in the so-called [[69 (sex position)|"sixty-nine" position]]. Spitting and/or swallowing of the ejaculatory fluids or giving a [[Pearl necklace (sexuality)|pearl necklace]] may cause different sexual stimulations. [[Autofellatio]] is a possible but rare variant; [[autocunnilingus]] may also be possible for women with extremely flexible spines.

An act of [[group sex]] restricted to one woman giving oral sex to several men is referred to as a ''gangsuck'', ''blowbang'' or ''lineup'', all derivatives of the slang term ''[[gang bang]]'' for group sex. [[Bukkake (sex act)|Bukkake]] and [[gokkun]] may also involve oral sex.

===Preserving virginity===

Oral sex is commonly used as a means of preserving [[virginity]], especially among heterosexual pairings; this is sometimes termed ''[[technical virginity]]'' (which additionally includes [[anal sex]], [[mutual masturbation]] and other [[non-penetrative sex]] acts, but excludes [[Sexual intercourse|penile-vaginal sex]]).&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intimate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite book| author = Ken Plummer | title = Modern Homosexualities: Fragments of Lesbian and Gay Experiences | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 2002| pages = 1920–1921 | accessdate = August 24, 2013|isbn =1134922426 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=liUcCPXcpAAC&amp;pg=PA1920|quote=The social construction of 'sex' as vaginal intercourse affects how other forms of sexual activity are evaluated as sexually satisfying or arousing; in some cases whether an activity is seen as a sexual act at all.

===Contraception and safe sex===
Oral sex alone cannot result in pregnancy and heterosexual couples may perform oral sex as their method of [[contraception]].&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crooks"&gt;{{cite book | title = Our Sexuality | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2010 | pages = 286–289 | accessdate = August 30, 2012 |isbn = 0495812943| url = https://books.google.com/?id=MpRnPtmdRVwC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286|quote=Noncoital forms of sexual intimacy, which have been called outercourse, can be a viable form of birth control.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For conception to take place, [[sperm]] from the [[human penis|penis]] must enter the [[uterus]] and [[fallopian tube]]s and fertilize the female's [[Ovum|egg]]. In humans, there is no connection between the [[gastrointestinal system]] and the [[reproductive system]],&lt;ref group=nb&gt;However, this has happened in [http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/teen-girl-vagina-pregnant-sperm-survival-oral-sex/story?id=9732562 bizarre circumstances] involving a stabbing.&lt;/ref&gt; and sperm ingested by the woman would be killed and broken down by [[acid]]s in her [[stomach]] and [[protein]]s in the [[small intestine]]. The breakdown products are then absorbed as a negligible quantity of [[nutrient]]s. However, there is a potential risk of pregnancy if [[semen]] comes in contact with the [[vagina]]l area in some way, such as semen in the [[ejaculate]] finding its way onto fingers, hands, or other body parts, which then comes in contact with the vaginal area.

Oral sex is not necessarily an effective method of preventing [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs), although some forms of STIs are believed to be less commonly spread in this way, and oral sex has been recommended as a form of [[safe sex]].&lt;ref name="testing"&gt;[http://www.gmhc.org/health/testing/geffen_sti.html Geffen Testing Center's HIV, Syphilis, and Hepatitis C Information Sheet].

Oral sex should be limited to the protected areas. A makeshift dental dam can be made out of a [[condom]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/dental-dams "How to Make a Dental Dam Using a Condom"], UCSB SexInfoOnline, February 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; or a latex or [[Nitrile rubber|nitrile glove]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://std.about.com/od/prevention/ht/dentaldamhowto.htm|title=How to Make Your Own Dental Dam From a Condom|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but using a real dental dam is seen as preferable; this is because real dental dams cover a larger area, avoid accidents caused by "slipping" outside the covered area, and avoid the risk that makeshift versions may be accidentally damaged or poked with the scissors during the cutting procedure. Plastic wrap may also be used as a barrier during oral sex, but there exists no conclusive scientific research regarding how effective it may or may not be at preventing disease transmission. Certain kinds of plastic wrap are manufactured to be microwaveable and are designed to have pores that open when heated, but there also exists no scientific research on what effect, if any, this has on disease transmission when used during oral sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexuality.about.com/od/saferse1/a/plastic-wrap-oral-sex.htm|title=Plastic Wrap and Oral Sex|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people complain that the thickness of the plastic dulls sensation.

===Prevalence===
A report issued in September 2005 by the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] was the basis of an article in the September 26, 2005 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. The report comes from the results of a computer-administered [[statistical survey|survey]] of over 12,000 Americans between the ages of 15 and 44, and states that over half the teenagers questioned have had oral sex. While some headlines have interpreted this as evidence that oral sex among teenagers is "on the rise", this was the first comprehensive study of its kind to examine the matter.&lt;ref name="lemonick"&gt;Lemonick, Michael D., [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1106324,00.html "A Teen Twist on Sex"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', New York, September 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) stated in 2009: "Studies indicate that oral sex is commonly practiced by sexually active male-female and same-gender couples of various ages, including adolescents."&lt;ref name="CDC, oral sex"/&gt; Research also indicates that "males are more likely than females to have received oral sex, whereas equal proportions of men and women have given oral sex."&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

==Health risks and other studies==

===Sexually transmitted infections===
[[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]], [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[gonorrhea]], [[herpes simplex virus|herpes]], [[hepatitis]] (multiple strains), and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), can be transmitted through oral sex.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web| title = Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance| publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)| year = 2008| accessdate = December 6, 2011|url =https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats08/surv2008-Complete.pdf}} Also see [https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats08/2008survFactSheet.PDF Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; Any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with [[HIV]], the virus that causes [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], poses a risk of infection. Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert J. Pratt| title = HIV &amp; AIDS: A Foundation for Nursing and Healthcare Practice | publisher = [[CRC Press]]|pages=306| isbn = 0340706392|year=2003| accessdate = August 21, 2013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=naSG-2RgRiYC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex and Society"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title=Sex and Society, Volume 1|isbn =0761479066|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|year=2009–2010|page=61|accessdate=August 29, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aVDZchwkIMEC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an increased risk of STI transmission if the receiving partner has wounds on his or her genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in his or her mouth, or [[Bleeding on probing|bleeding gums]].&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC, oral sex"/&gt; Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work soon before or after performing oral sex can also increase the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; These wounds, even when they are [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]], increase the chances of contracting STIs that can be transmitted orally under these conditions.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; Such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es found in, around and secreted from the genital regions. Because of the aforementioned factors, medical sources advise the use of [[condom]]s or [[Safe sex#Barrier protection|other effective barrier methods]] when performing or receiving oral sex with a partner whose STI status is unknown.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

===HPV and oral cancer link===
Links have been reported between oral sex and [[oral cancer]] with human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected people. In 2005, a research study at [[Malmö University]]'s Faculty of Odontology suggested that performing unprotected oral sex on a person infected with HPV might increase the risk of oral cancer. The study found that 36 percent of the [[cancer]] patients had HPV compared to only 1 percent of the healthy control group.

Another study in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' suggests a [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between oral sex and [[head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV, a virus that has been implicated in the majority of cervical cancers and which has been detected in throat cancer tissue in numerous studies. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity and those with more than five oral sex partners had a 250 percent increased risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D'Souza G |title=Case-control study of human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer |journal=N.

===Miscarriage reduction===
Fellatio may reduce the risk of [[miscarriage]]s by inducing [[Immune tolerance in pregnancy|immunological tolerance]] in the woman by exposure to the proteins in her partner's semen, a process known as [[paternal tolerance]]. While any exposure to a partner's semen appears to decrease a woman's chances for the various immunological disorders that can occur during pregnancy, immunological tolerance could be most quickly established through the oral introduction and gastrointestinal absorption of semen.&lt;ref name="pmid10706945"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koelman CA, Coumans AB, Nijman HW, Doxiadis II, Dekker GA, Claas FH |title=Correlation between oral sex and a low incidence of preeclampsia: a role for soluble HLA in seminal fluid? |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=155–166 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10706945 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(99)00062-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewScientist&gt;{{cite news | last=Fox | first=Douglas | title=Gentle Persuasion | publisher=''[[New Scientist]]''| date=February 9, 2002 | accessdate=June 17, 2007 | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17323294.200-gentle-persuasion.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that some of the studies potentially included the presence of confounding factors, such as the possibility that women who regularly perform fellatio and swallow semen also engage in more frequent intercourse, the researchers also noted that, either way, "the data still overwhelmingly supports the main theory" behind all their studies—that repeated exposure to semen establishes the maternal immunological tolerance necessary for a safe and successful pregnancy.&lt;ref name="NewScientist"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SeminalPriming&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robertson SA, Bromfield JJ, Tremellen KP |title=Seminal 'priming' for protection from pre-eclampsia-a unifying hypothesis |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=253–265 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12896827 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(03)00052-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural views==
[[File:Fellatio.png|thumb|right|275px|[[Fellatio]] in [[69 (sex position)|69 position]] ]]
{{See also|Cunnilingus|Fellatio}}

Cultural views on oral sex range from aversion to high regard.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; It, especially fellatio,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/sex/feature/2000/05/22/oral_history/print.html "The History of Fellatio"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524143842/http://archive.salon.com/sex/feature/2000/05/22/oral_history/print.html |date=May 24, 2006 }}, ''Salon.com'', May 22, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; has been considered [[taboo]], or at least discouraged, in many cultures and parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; Laws of some jurisdictions regard oral sex as [[Sexual penetration|penetrative sex]] for the purposes of [[Sex and the law|sexual offenses]] with regard to the act, but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice itself, in contrast to anal sex or [[extramarital sex]].

In [[Ancient Rome]], fellatio was considered profoundly taboo.&lt;ref name="Irrumation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/priap/prp105.htm |title=Irrumation |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual acts were generally seen through the prism of submission and control. This is apparent in the two [[Latin]] words for the act: ''irrumare'' (to penetrate orally), and ''fellare'' (to be penetrated orally). Under this system, it was considered to be abhorrent for a male to perform fellatio, since that would mean that he was penetrated (controlled), whereas receiving fellatio from a woman or another man of lower social status (such as a slave or debtor) was not humiliating. The Romans regarded oral sex as being far more shameful than, for example, anal sex – known practitioners were supposed to have [[Halitosis|foul breath]] and were often unwelcome as guests at a dinner table.&lt;ref name="Irrumation"/&gt;

In contrast to historical views on fellatio, cunnilingus is revered as a spiritually fulfilling practice in Chinese [[Taoism]], which regards it as having the ability to enhance [[longevity]].&lt;ref&gt;Octavio Paz (1969) ''Conjunctions and Disjunctions''; trans. Helen R. Lane. London: Wildwood House; p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[Western culture]], oral sex is widely practiced among adolescents&lt;ref name="lemonick"/&gt; and adults.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

People give various reasons for their dislike of oral sex.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; Some state that since it does not result in reproduction, it is therefore unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buschmiller|first=Rev. Robert|title=Oral Sex in Marriage|url=http://www.presentationministries.com/brochures/OralSex.asp|publisher=Presentation Ministries|accessdate=November 22, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206194539/http://www.presentationministries.com/publications/OralSex.asp|archivedate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others find it less intimate because it is not a face-to-face practice,&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; or believe that it is a humiliating or unclean practice;&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pina"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2804438|last=Pina-Cabral|first=Joao de|title=Tamed Violence: Genital Symbolism is Portuguese popular culture|journal=Man|year=1992|volume=28|issue=1|series=N.S|pages=101–120|jstor=2804438}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is humiliating or unclean are opinions that are, at least in some cases, connected with the symbolism attached to different parts of the body.&lt;ref name="Pina"/&gt; Opposite these views, people also believe that oral sex "is one of the most intimate behaviors that a couple can engage in because it requires total trust and vulnerability."&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

While commonly believed that [[lesbian sexual practices]] involve cunnilingus for all [[women who have sex with women]] (WSW), some have an aversion to cunnilingus due to not liking the experience or psychological or social factors, such as finding it unclean.&lt;ref name="Belge"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathy|last=Belge|title=Do All Lesbians Like Oral Sex?|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=3 June 2012|url=http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbiansex/f/DoAllLesbiansLikeOral.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCormick"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naomi B.

==Terminology and slang==
There are many words which refer to oral sex, including [[euphemism]]s and [[sexual slang]]. Like all aspects of sexuality, there exists a large number of variations on a theme, a few common ones being:

* Giving head – A common slang term for giving oral sex to either a man or woman is ''giving head'', from the term ''head job'' (in contrast to ''[[hand job]]'', manual stimulation). A play on the slang term ''head'' resulted in the slang term ''brains'', or ''brain salad surgery'', ''domes'' or ''getting domes.''
* Plate – A once common [[British English|British]] [[rhyming slang]] for ''fellate'' that arose in the gay slang language of [[Polari]] that spread in the 1960s. The term is less common today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voodooverse.wordpress.com/polari-baskets-abound/ Polari]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422181306/http://voodooverse.wordpress.com/polari-baskets-abound/ |date=April 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cunnilingus is also sometimes referred to as ''muff diving'', ''eating out'' or ''poon-job'', a slang term and a cunnilingus variant of ''[[blow job]]'', where ''poon'' is short for ''poontang'' or ''punani''.
* Additionally, in lesbian culture, several common slang terms used are ''carpet munching'', ''giving lip'', ''lip service'' or ''[[Tipping the Velvet|tipping the velvet]]'' (a faux-"Victorian" expression invented by novelist [[Sarah Waters]]).

Other slang terms for oral sex include ''going down on'' (male or female), ''licking out'' and ''muff diving'' (female), ''blow job'' (male), ''dome'' (male or female), ''sucking off'' (male), ''playing the skin flute'' (male recipient), ''rolling cigars'' (male recipient), ''lolly-gagging'' (gay male-on-male), ''gaining knowledge'' (male recipient) and ''bust down'' (male). Forced fellatio is often called ''Egyptian rape'' or simply ''Egyptian''; this goes back to the time of the [[Crusades]] when [[Mamluk]]s were alleged to force their Christian captives to do this.&lt;ref&gt;Edwardes, Allen; Masters, Robert E. L. ''The cradle of erotica'', New York: Julian Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peonidin''' is an [[O-methylated anthocyanidin]] derived from [[Cyanidin]], and a primary [[plant]] [[pigment]]. Peonidin gives purplish-red hues to flowers such as the [[peony]], from which it takes its name, and roses. It is also present in some blue flowers, such as the [[morning glory]].

Like most [[Anthocyanidin|anthocyanidins]], it is [[pH]] sensitive, and changes from red to blue as pH rises because anthocyanidins are highly conjugated chromophores. When the pH is changed, the extent of the conjugation (of the double bonds) is altered, which alters the wavelength of light energy absorbed by the molecule. (Natural anthocyanidins are most stable in a very low pH environment; at pH 8.0, most become colorless.)  At pH 2.0, peonidin is cherry red; at 3.0 a strong yellowish pink; at 5.0 it is grape red-purple; and at 8.0 it becomes deep blue; unlike many anthocyanidins, however, it is stable at higher pH, and has been isolated as a blue colorant from the brilliant "Heavenly Blue" morning glory (''Ipomoea tricolor Cav cv'').

Because of its unusual color stability, a cafeyl-acylated buffered formulation of it has been patented for use as food coloring.

Peonidin, like many anthocyanidins, has shown potent inhibitory and apoptotic effects on cancer cells ''in vitro'', notably metastatic human breast cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jung Yeon Kwon |author2=Ki Won Lee |author3=Haeng Jeon Hur |author4=Hyong Joo Lee | date = 2007 | title = Peonidin Inhibits Phorbol-Ester-Induced COX-2 Expression and Transformation in JB6 P+ Cells by Blocking Phosphorylation of ERK-1 and -2 | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1095  | issue = 1 | pages = 513–520 | doi=10.1196/annals.1397.055 | pmid=17404064}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A very large question, however, has been raised about anthocyanidins' penetration and retention in human cells ''in vivo'', due to their rapid elimination from the human body.

By far the greatest dietary source of peonidin is raw [[cranberry|cranberries]], which contain 42&amp;nbsp;mg per 100&amp;nbsp;g of fruit.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Blueberries, plums, grapes, and cherries also contain significant amounts, ranging from 5 to 12&amp;nbsp;mg/100&amp;nbsp;g. Only fresh fruit has been shown to contain significant peonidin; frozen blueberries have been shown to contain almost none.  Peonidin has been found in concentrations of up to 40&amp;nbsp;mg per 100&amp;nbsp;g (cooked) of certain cultivars of purple fleshed sweet potatoes; the amount of peonidin varies greatly across cultivars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://fsweb2.schaub.ncsu.edu/usdaars/acrobatpubs/s114-150/s132.pdf |author1=Van-Den Truong |author2=Nigel Deighton |author3=Roger T.

The higher level of peonidin in fresh fruit corresponds to the rule of thumb that more natural fruit is healthier. Specifically, the amount of phenolic compounds in cranberries has been found to be inversely correlated with fruit size and crop yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.actahort.org/members/showpdf?booknrarnr=574_32 | journal = ISHS Acta Horticulturae | volume = 574: VII International Symposium on Vaccinium Culture | title = Evaluation Of Fruit Chemistry In Cranberry Germplasm: Potential For Breeding Varieties With Enhanced Health Constituents |author1=N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1817">The '''Photochemical Reflectance Index''' ('''PRI''') is a reflectance measurement developed by [[John Gamon]] during his tenure as a postdoctorate fellow supervised by [[Christopher Field]] at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University. The PRI is sensitive to changes in [[carotenoid]] pigments (e.g. [[xanthophyll]] pigments) in live [[foliage]]. Carotenoid pigments are indicative of photosynthetic light use efficiency, or the rate of [[carbon dioxide]] uptake by foliage per unit energy absorbed. As such, it is used in studies of vegetation productivity and stress. Because the PRI measures plant responses to stress, it can be used to assess general ecosystem health using satellite data or other forms of remote sensing. Applications include [[vegetation health]] in evergreen [[shrubland]]s, forests, and agricultural crops prior to [[senescence]]. PRI is defined by the following equation using reflectance (ρ) at 531 and 570&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength:

:&lt;math&gt;PRI=\frac{(\rho 531- \rho 570)}{( \rho 531+ \rho 570)}&lt;/math&gt;
Some authors use
:&lt;math&gt;PRI=\frac{( \rho 570- \rho 531)}{( \rho 570+ \rho 531)}&lt;/math&gt;

The values range from –1 to 1.

The '''privileged positions of business and science''' refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge and the ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

== Privileged position of business ==

Businesses have considerable power in decision-making processes in business-oriented societies. High level executives make discrete decisions about technological innovation without regard to consequences. Political scientist Edward Woodhouse states that businesses make key economic decisions that include creating jobs, choosing industrial plant and equipment, and deciding which new products to develop and market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, businesses hold a privileged position related to politics in the sense that they are capable of considerable influence over key public choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership role that business has in the economy gives executives of large corporations an unusual kind of degree of influence over governmental policy making.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government officials have incentives to carry out businesses' demands. They know that failure of businesses to maintain high employment will upset voters more quickly than anything else.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Our economy functions as a chain effect. Businesses that get what they want provide plentiful jobs and stimulate cash flow in the economy. As a result, citizens are happy, and this happiness translates to more trust and faith in the government party. Government officials thus have a higher chance of reelection.

It is clear that the businesses have the most influence in this chain effect. If a business fails, jobs are lost, citizens are unhappy, and the government party loses trust and their chance of reelection. One example of this was President Bush’s plummeting popularity and resulting defeat by Bill Clinton.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Therefore, it would make sense for government officials to reach out to these executives and provide valuable resources to benefit both parties. Power is shifted from government officials to business executives, because these executives have the ability to influence government officials to meet their demands. As a result, a large category of decisions is turned over to businessmen, and taken off the agenda of government. In a way, business managers become the public officials they represent.

This privilege of power is unique to corporations only. If workers want reform on unfair working conditions or pay, they must form a worker’s union. However, a worker’s union has considerably less influence than a corporation. As opposed to workers’ unions, businesses exercise more control on governmental policy making because workers are expendable – workers need money more urgently than society needs their services, so a business can operate for a lot longer than workers can afford to stay off the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privileged position of science ==

Without the knowledge of scientists and technologists, there would be no possibility of producing new technology and progress in a positive manner. Those who have these types of  knowledge and abilities are essentially the "seed" of technological innovation. They have the following three privileges:

*Knowledge
*Learning and teaching of new knowledge 
*Political implications of innovation

Based on previous scientific knowledge, one or several are able to use it and/or build on it to innovate. Kleinman and Vallas, point out that scientists control the modification, mediation and contest of emerging knowledge.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with this knowledge can also teach future generations the same to keep this process moving forward. Woodhouse that states that engineers are among the top professionals that promote the new innovations without consequences.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|1997|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the foundation of the privileged position of science, that only a select have scientific and/or technological knowledge and capable of substantial feats, good or bad. Engineers and scientists have the powerful position of being able to choose the path of innovation for emerging technology. Technologists and scientists hold a privileged position additionally in that their innovations often have political implications. Woodhouse makes the comparison of innovation to legislative acts, stating that they both establish a framework that will follow for many generations.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"/&gt;

== Relationships between privileged positions of business and science ==

Business and science are part of an important societal circle specifically relating to the production and implementation of technology. In simple terms, scientists and technologists design and create, while businesses provide the means to create, produce and implement. As Woodhouse claims, it would be a mistake to overlook business executives' and elected officials' dependence on the technologists because innovation is so highly regarded.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"/&gt;

Businesses that rely on scientists and technologists cannot function without them, but have authority over them. Woodhouse claims that the one reason green technology has not emerged faster and stronger is because the brown chemistry formula fulfilled many of the needs of scientists and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, since brown chemistry was innovated over less toxic and recyclable green technologies, it is shown that business has more authority over that of technologists and scientists. Woodhouse points out that there has been considerable delay on a promising area of green chemistry: supercritical fluids. The opinions range from targeting the culprit as the complexity of the equipment, to maintenance difficulties, to the equipment costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the interconnection of business and science, and how technology can be slowed by technology and/or business (and vice versa). Woodhouse also states that twentieth-century chemists, chemical engineers, and chemical industry executives made central decisions which considerably modeled society's experiences with chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical industry, which includes scientists, technologists, and businessmen, uniquely controls what happens or what can happen to large number of people who are exposed to chemicals.

Business and science are considered of utmost importance in current developed countries. However, one working without the other has the potential to cause major issues. Woodhouse points out what the vice president of Shaw Carpets explained at a congressional hearing: that the V.P. is the person whose job it is to tell the chemists and chemical engineers that it is possible to produce carpets using "green" processes, because the students had not learned this from their respective university curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be many positive outcomes of the unison operation of business and science, and it is vital that this does occur in order to prevent major problems and unintended consequences.

'''Psychoneuroimmunology''' ('''PNI'''), also referred to as '''psychoendoneuroimmunology''' ('''PENI''') or '''psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology''' ('''PNEI'''), is the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Michael Irwin| first = Kavita Vedhara | title = Human Psychoneuroimmunology| publisher = Oxford University Press|year=2005| isbn = 978-0-19-856884-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/775894214|title=The Oxford handbook of psychoneuroimmunology|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Segerstrom, Suzanne C.|isbn=9780195394399|location=New York|oclc=775894214}}&lt;/ref&gt; PNI takes an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[immunology]], [[physiology]], [[genetics]], [[pharmacology]], [[molecular biology]], [[psychiatry]], [[behavioral medicine]], [[infectious diseases]], [[endocrinology]], and [[rheumatology]].

The main interests of PNI are the interactions between the [[central nervous system|nervous]] and [[immune]] systems and the relationships between mental processes and [[health]]. PNI studies, among other things, the [[physiology|physiological]] functioning of the neuroimmune system in health and disease; disorders of the neuroimmune system ([[autoimmune diseases]]; [[hypersensitivity|hypersensitivities]]; [[immune deficiency]]); and the physical, chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the neuroimmune system [[in vitro]], [[in situ]], and [[in vivo]].

==History==
Interest in the relationship between psychiatric syndromes or symptoms and immune function has been a consistent theme since the beginning of modern medicine.
[[File:Claude Bernard and his pupils. Oil painting after Léon-Augus Wellcome V0017769.jpg|thumbnail|Claude Bernard, the father of modern physiology, with his pupils]]
[[Claude Bernard]], a French physiologist of the [[Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]], formulated the concept of the ''[[milieu interieur]]'' in the mid-1800s. In 1865, Bernard described the perturbation of this internal state: "... there are protective functions of organic elements holding living materials in reserve and maintaining without interruption humidity, heat and other conditions indispensable to vital activity. Sickness and death are only a dislocation or perturbation of that mechanism" (Bernard, 1865). [[Walter Cannon]], a professor of physiology at [[Harvard University]] coined the commonly used term, [[homeostasis]], in his book ''The Wisdom of the Body'', 1932, from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word ''homoios'', meaning similar, and ''stasis'', meaning position. In his work with animals, Cannon observed that any change of emotional state in the beast, such as [[anxiety]], [[Distress (medicine)|distress]], or [[rage (emotion)|rage]], was accompanied by total cessation of movements of the stomach (''Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage'', 1915). These studies looked into the relationship between the effects of emotions and perceptions on the [[autonomic nervous system]], namely the [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] responses that initiated the recognition of the [[fight or flight response|freeze, fight or flight response]]. His findings were published from time to time in professional journals, then summed up in book form in ''The Mechanical Factors of Digestion'', published in 1911.
[[File:Hans Selye.JPG|thumbnail|left|Bust of Hans Selye at [[Selye János University]], [[Komárno]], [[Slovakia]]]]
[[Hans Selye]], a student of [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[McGill University]], and a researcher at [[Université de Montréal]], experimented with animals by putting them under different physical and mental adverse conditions and noted that under these difficult conditions the body consistently [[Adaptation|adapted]] to heal and recover. Several years of experimentation that formed the empiric foundation of Selye's concept of the [[General Adaptation Syndrome]]. This syndrome consists of an enlargement of the [[adrenal]] gland, atrophy of the [[thymus]], [[spleen]], and other [[lymphoid]] tissue, and gastric [[Peptic ulcer|ulcerations]].

Selye describes three stages of adaptation, including an initial brief alarm reaction, followed by a prolonged period of resistance, and a terminal stage of exhaustion and death. This foundational work led to a rich line of research on the biological functioning of [[glucocorticoids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Neylan Thomas C | year = 1998 | title = Hans Selye and the Field of Stress Research | url = | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 230 | doi=10.1176/jnp.10.2.230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mid-20th century studies of psychiatric patients reported immune alterations in psychotic individuals, including lower numbers of [[lymphocytes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Freeman H, Elmadjian F | year = 1947 | title = The relationship between blood sugar and lymphocyte levels in normal and psychotic subjects | url = | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 226–33 | doi=10.1097/00006842-194707000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Phillips L, Elmadjian F | year = 1947 | title = A Rorschach tension score and the diurnal lymphocyte curve in psychotic subjects | url = | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 364–71 | doi=10.1097/00006842-194711000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and poorer [[antibody]] response to [[pertussis vaccination]], compared with nonpsychiatric control subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vaughan WT, Sullivan JC, Elmadjian F | year = 1949 | title = Immunity and schizophrenia | url = | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 327–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, George F. Solomon, from the [[University of California in Los Angeles]], and his research team coined the term "psychoimmunology" and published a landmark paper: "Emotions, immunity, and disease: a speculative theoretical integration."&lt;ref&gt;Solomon GF, Moos RH.

Psychiatry 1964; 11: 657–74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
In 1975, [[Robert Ader]] and [[Nicholas Cohen]], at the [[University of Rochester]], advanced PNI with their demonstration of [[Classical conditioning|classic conditioning]] of immune function, and they subsequently coined the term "psychoneuroimmunology".&lt;ref&gt;R Ader and N Cohen. [http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/abstract/37/4/333 Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression.] Psychosomatic Medicine, Vol 37, Issue 4 333-340&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roch2"&gt;{{cite news|title = Robert Ader, Founder of Psychoneuroimmunology, Dies|url = http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/index.cfm?id=3370|work = [[University of Rochester Medical Center]]|publisher = |date = 2011-12-20|accessdate = 2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ader was investigating how long conditioned responses (in the sense of [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s conditioning of dogs to drool when they heard a bell ring) might last in laboratory rats. To condition the rats, he used a combination{{clarify|date=July 2013}} of [[saccharin]]-laced water (the conditioned stimulus) and the drug [[Cytoxan]], which unconditionally induces [[nausea and taste aversion]] and suppression of immune function. Ader was surprised to discover that after conditioning, just feeding the rats saccharin-laced water was associated with the death of some animals and he proposed that they had been immunosuppressed after receiving the conditioned stimulus. Ader (a psychologist) and Cohen (an immunologist) directly tested this hypothesis by deliberately immunizing conditioned and unconditioned animals, exposing these and other control groups to the conditioned taste stimulus, and then measuring the amount of antibody produced.  The highly reproducible results revealed that conditioned rats exposed to the conditioned stimulus were indeed immuno suppressed. In other words, a signal via the nervous system (taste) was affecting immune function. This was one of the first scientific experiments that demonstrated that the nervous system can affect the immune system.

In the 1970s, [[Hugo Besedovsky]], [[Adriana del Rey]] and [[Ernst Sorkin]], working in Switzerland, reported multi-directional immune-neuro-endocrine interactions, since they show that not only the brain can influence immune processes but also the immune response itself can affect the brain and neuroendocrine mechanisms. They found that the immune responses to innocuous antigens triggers an increase in the activity of hypothalamic neurons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besedovsky|first=H.|last2=Sorkin|first2=E.|last3=Felix|first3=D.|last4=Haas|first4=H.|date=May 1977|title=Hypothalamic changes during the immune response|journal=European Journal of Immunology|volume=7|issue=5|pages=323–325|doi=10.1002/eji.1830070516|issn=0014-2980|pmid=326564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besedovsky|first=H.|last2=del Rey|first2=A.|last3=Sorkin|first3=E.|last4=Da Prada|first4=M.|last5=Burri|first5=R.|last6=Honegger|first6=C.|date=1983-08-05|title=The immune response evokes changes in brain noradrenergic neurons|journal=Science|volume=221|issue=4610|pages=564–566|issn=0036-8075|pmid=6867729|doi=10.1126/science.6867729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hormonal and autonomic nerve responses that are  relevant for immunoregulation  and are integrated at brain levels (see review&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besedovsky|first=Hugo O.|last2=Rey|first2=Adriana Del|date=January 2007|title=Physiology of psychoneuroimmunology: a personal view|journal=Brain, Behavior, and Immunity|volume=21|issue=1|pages=34–44|doi=10.1016/j.bbi.2006.09.008|issn=0889-1591|pmid=17157762}}&lt;/ref&gt;). On these bases, they proposed that the immune system acts as a sensorial receptor organ that, besides its peripheral effects, can communicate to the brain and associated neuro-endocrine structures its state of activity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These investigators also identified products from immune cells, later characterized as cytokines, that mediate this immune-brain communication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besedovsky|first=H.|last2=del Rey|first2=A.|last3=Sorkin|first3=E.|last4=Dinarello|first4=C.

In 1981, [[David L. Felten]], then working at the [[Indiana University]] School of Medicine, discovered a network of nerves leading to blood vessels as well as cells of the immune system. The researcher, along with his team, also found nerves in the [[thymus]] and [[spleen]] terminating near clusters of [[lymphocyte]]s, [[macrophage]]s, and [[mast cell]]s, all of which help control immune function. This discovery provided one of the first indications of how neuro-immune interaction occurs.

Ader, Cohen, and Felten went on to edit the groundbreaking book ''Psychoneuroimmunology'' in 1981, which laid out the underlying premise that the [[brain]] and immune system represent a single, integrated system of defense.

In 1985, research by [[neuropharmacology|neuropharmacologist]] [[Candace Pert]], of the [[National Institutes of Health]] at [[Georgetown University]], revealed that [[neuropeptide]]-specific receptors are present on the cell walls of both the brain and the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;Pert CB, Ruff MR, Weber RJ, Herkenham M. "Neuropeptides and their receptors: a psychosomatic network" ''J Immunol'' 1985 Aug;135(2 Suppl):820s-826s&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruff M, Schiffmann E, Terranova V, Pert CB |date = Dec 1985|title = Neuropeptides are chemoattractants for human tumor cells and monocytes: a possible mechanism for metastasis|url = |journal = Clin Immunol Immunopathol|volume = 37|issue = 3|pages = 387–96|doi = 10.1016/0090-1229(85)90108-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery that neuropeptides and neurotransmitters act directly upon the immune system shows their close association with [[emotions]] and suggests mechanisms through which emotions, from the [[limbic system]], and immunology are deeply interdependent. Showing that the immune and [[endocrine]] systems are modulated not only by the brain but also by the [[central nervous system]] itself affected the understanding of emotions, as well as disease.

Contemporary advances in [[psychiatry]], immunology, [[neurology]], and other integrated disciplines of medicine has fostered enormous growth for PNI. The mechanisms underlying behaviorally induced alterations of immune function, and immune alterations inducing behavioral changes, are likely to have clinical and therapeutic implications that will not be fully appreciated until more is known about the extent of these interrelationships in normal and pathophysiological states.

==The immune-brain loop==
{{further|Cell signaling networks|Signal transduction}}

PNI research looks for the exact mechanisms by which specific neuroimmune effects are achieved. Evidence for nervous-immunological interactions exist at multiple biological levels.

The immune system and the brain communicate through signaling pathways. The brain and the immune system are the two major adaptive systems of the body. Two major pathways are involved in this cross-talk: the [[Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis), and the [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS), via the [[sympathoadrenal system|sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis]] (SAM axis). The activation of SNS during an immune response might be aimed to localize the inflammatory response.

The body's primary stress management system is the HPA axis. The HPA axis responds to physical and mental challenge to maintain homeostasis in part by controlling the body's [[cortisol]] level. Dysregulation of the HPA axis is implicated in numerous stress-related diseases, with evidence from meta-analyses indicating that different types/duration of stressors and unique personal variables can shape the HPA response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Gregory E.|author2=Chen, Edith |author3=Zhou, Eric S. |title=If it goes up, must it come down? Chronic stress and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in humans|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=January 2007|volume=133|issue=1|pages=25–45|pmid=17201569|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HPA axis activity and cytokines are intrinsically intertwined: inflammatory cytokines stimulate [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) and cortisol secretion, while, in turn, [[glucocorticoids]] suppress the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines.

Molecules called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which include [[interleukin-1]] (IL-1), [[Interleukin-2]] (IL-2), [[interleukin-6]] (IL-6), [[Interleukin-12]] (IL-12), [[Interferon-gamma]] (IFN-Gamma) and [[tumor necrosis factor alpha]] (TNF-alpha) can affect brain growth as well as neuronal function. Circulating immune cells such as [[macrophages]], as well as [[glial]] cells ([[microglia]] and [[astrocytes]]) secrete these molecules. Cytokine regulation of hypothalamic function is an active area of research for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders.&lt;ref name = Covelli&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16029148 | volume=12 | issue=15 | title=Drug targets in stress-related disorders | year=2005 |vauthors=Covelli V, Passeri ME, Leogrande D, Jirillo E, Amati L | pages=1801–9 | journal=Curr. Med. Chem. | doi=10.2174/0929867054367202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytokines mediate and control [[immune]] and [[inflammation|inflammatory]] responses. Complex interactions exist between cytokines, inflammation and the adaptive responses in maintaining [[homeostasis]]. Like the stress response, the inflammatory reaction is crucial for survival. Systemic inflammatory reaction results in stimulation of four major programs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Elenkov IJ | authorlink5 = Chrousos GP., Iezzoni DG, Daly A, Harris AG, Chrousos GP. | year = 2005 | title = Cytokine dysregulation, inflammation and well-being | url = | journal = Neuroimmunomodulation | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 255–69 | doi=10.1159/000087104 | pmid=16166805}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the acute-phase reaction
* [[sickness behavior]]
* the pain program
* the stress response

These are mediated by the HPA axis and the SNS. Common human diseases such as [[allergy]], autoimmunity, chronic infections and [[sepsis]] are characterized by a dysregulation of the pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory and [[T helper]] (Th1) versus (Th2) cytokine balance.

Recent studies show pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]] processes take place during [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[mania]] and [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] disease, in addition to autoimmune hypersensitivity and chronic infections.

Chronic secretion of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] [[hormones]], [[glucocorticoids]] (GCs) and [[catecholamines]] (CAs), as a result of disease, may reduce the effect of [[neurotransmitters]], including [[serotonin]]{{mcn|date=November 2016}}, [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]], or other receptors in the brain, thereby leading to the dysregulation of neurohormones. Under stimulation, norepinephrine is released from the sympathetic nerve terminals in organs, and the target immune cells express [[adrenergic receptors|adrenoreceptors]]. Through stimulation of these receptors, locally released norepinephrine, or circulating catecholamines such as [[epinephrine]], affect [[lymphocyte]] traffic, circulation, and proliferation, and modulate cytokine production and the functional activity of different [[lymphoid]] cells.

Glucocorticoids also inhibit the further secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone from the [[hypothalamus]] and ACTH from the [[pituitary]] ([[negative feedback]]). Under certain conditions stress hormones may facilitate inflammation through induction of signaling pathways and through activation of the [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone]].

These abnormalities and the failure of the adaptive systems to resolve inflammation affect the well-being of the individual, including behavioral parameters, quality of life and sleep, as well as indices of [[metabolic]] and cardiovascular health, developing into a "systemic anti-inflammatory feedback" and/or "hyperactivity" of the local pro-inflammatory factors which may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease.

This systemic or neuro-inflammation and neuroimmune activation have been shown to play a role in the [[etiology]] of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders such as [[Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], pain, and [[AIDS]]-associated dementia. However, [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s also modulate central nervous system (CNS) function in the absence of overt immunological, physiological, or psychological challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/pa-05-054.html Functional Links between the Immune System, Brain Function and Behavior]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoneuroimmunological effects==
There are now sufficient data to conclude that immune modulation by psychosocial stressors and/or interventions can lead to actual health changes. Although changes related to [[infectious disease]] and [[wound]] healing have provided the strongest evidence to date, the clinical importance of immunological dysregulation is highlighted by increased risks across diverse conditions and diseases. For example, stressors can produce profound health consequences. In one epidemiological study, all-cause mortality increased in the month following a severe stressor – the death of a spouse.&lt;ref name="Kaprio, J. 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kaprio J. |author2=Koskenvuo M. |author3=Rita H. | year = 1987 | title = Mortality after bereavement: a prospective study of 95,647 widowed persons | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 77 | issue = 3| pages = 283–7 | doi=10.2105/ajph.77.3.283|pmc=1646890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists propose that stressful events trigger cognitive and affective responses which, in turn, induce sympathetic nervous system and endocrine changes, and these ultimately impair immune function.&lt;ref name="Chrousos, G.

===Understanding stress and immune function===

[[Stress (medicine)|Stress]] is thought to affect immune function through emotional and/or behavioral manifestations such as [[anxiety]], [[fear]], [[Stress (biology)|tension]], [[anger]] and [[sadness]] and physiological changes such as [[heart rate]], [[blood pressure]], and [[sweating]]. Researchers have suggested that these changes are beneficial if they are of limited duration,&lt;ref name="Chrousos, G. P 1992"/&gt; but when stress is chronic, the system is unable to maintain equilibrium or [[homeostasis]]; the body remains in a state of arousal, where digestion is slower to reactivate or does not reactivate properly, often resulting in indigestion. Furthermore, blood pressure stays at higher levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Psychoneuroimmunology, Mind-Body Psychology and the Fight or Flight Response|last=Chapman|first=Cathy|date=Dec 27, 2010|website=|access-date=Oct 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the earlier PNI studies, which was published in 1960, subjects were led to believe that they had accidentally caused serious injury to a companion through misuse of explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McDonald RD, Yagi K | year = 1960 | title = A note on eosinopenia as an index of psychological stress | url = | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 2 | issue = 22| pages = 149–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then decades of research resulted in two large meta-analyses, which showed consistent immune dysregulation in healthy people who are experiencing stress.

In the first meta-analysis by Herbert and Cohen in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herbert TB, Cohen S | year = 1993 | title = Stress and immunity in humans: a meta-analytic review | url = | journal = Psychosom. Med. | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 364–379 | doi=10.1097/00006842-199307000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; they examined 38 studies of stressful events and immune function in healthy adults. They included studies of acute laboratory stressors (e.g. a speech task), short-term naturalistic stressors (e.g. medical examinations), and long-term naturalistic stressors (e.g. divorce, bereavement, caregiving, unemployment). They found consistent stress-related increases in numbers of total [[white blood cells]], as well as decreases in the numbers of [[helper T cells]], [[suppressor T cells]], and [[cytotoxic T cells]], [[B cells]], and [[natural killer cell]]s (NK). They also reported stress-related decreases in NK and T cell function, and T cell proliferative responses to [[phytohaemagglutinin]] [PHA] and [[concanavalin A]] [Con A]. These effects were consistent for short-term and long-term naturalistic stressors, but not laboratory stressors.

In the second meta-analysis by Zorrilla et al. in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zorrilla E. P. |author2=Luborsky L. |author3=McKay J. R. |author4=Rosenthal R. |author5=Houldin A. |author6=Tax A. |author7=McCorkle R. |author8=Seligman D. A. |author9=Schmidt K. | year = 2001 | title = The relationship of depression and stressors to immunological assays: a meta-analytic review | url = | journal = Brain Behavior and Immunity | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 199–226 | doi=10.1006/brbi.2000.0597}}&lt;/ref&gt; they replicated Herbert and Cohen's meta-analysis. Using the same study selection procedures, they analyzed 75 studies of stressors and human immunity. Naturalistic stressors were associated with increases in number of circulating [[neutrophils]], decreases in number and percentages of total [[T cells]] and helper T cells, and decreases in percentages of natural killer cell (NK) cells and [[cytotoxic T cell]] lymphocytes. They also replicated Herbert and Cohen's finding of stress-related decreases in NKCC and T cell [[mitogen]] proliferation to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A).

More recently, there has been increasing interest in the links between interpersonal stressors and immune function. For example, marital conflict, loneliness, caring for a person with a chronic medical condition, and other forms on interpersonal stress dysregulate immune function.&lt;ref name = "Ja_review"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Jaremka, L.M. |title=Synergistic relationships among stress, depression, and troubled relationships: Insights from Psychoneuroimmunology |journal=Depression and Anxiety|volume= |pages= |year=in press|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/da.22078/full |accessdate=2013-04-08|doi=10.1002/da.22078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication between the brain and immune system===
* Stimulation of brain sites alters immunity (stressed animals have altered immune systems).
* Damage to brain hemispheres alters immunity (hemispheric lateralization effects).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sumner R.C. |author2=Parton A. |author3=Nowicky A.N. |author4=Kishore U. |author5=Gidron Y. | year = | title = Hemispheric lateralisation and immune function: A systematic review of human research | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572811002347 | journal = Journal of Neuroimmunology | volume = 240 -241| issue = | pages = 1–12 | doi=10.1016/j.jneuroim.2011.08.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Immune cells produce cytokines that act on the CNS.
* Immune cells respond to signals from the CNS.

===Communication between neuroendocrine and immune system===
* Glucocorticoids and catecholamines influence immune cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Papanicolaou DA, Wilder RL, Manolagas SC, Chrousos GP|title=The pathophysiologic roles of interleukin-6 in human disease|journal=Ann Intern Med|year=1998|volume=128|issue=2|pages=127–137|pmid=9441573|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-128-2-199801150-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Neil R.|title=Physiology of behavior|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston|isbn=0205239390|page=611|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Endorphins from [[pituitary]] and [[adrenal medulla]] act on immune system.
* Activity of the immune system is correlated with neurochemical/neuroendocrine activity of brain cells.

===Connections between glucocorticoids and immune system===
* Anti-inflammatory hormones that enhance the organism's response to a stressor.
* Prevent the overreaction of the body's own defense system.
* Regulators of the immune system.
* Affect cell growth, proliferation and differentiation.
* Cause immunosuppression.
* Suppress [[cell adhesion]], [[antigen]] presentation, chemotaxis and cytotoxicity.
* Increase [[apoptosis]].

===Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)===
Release of [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH) from the [[hypothalamus]] is influenced by stress.
* CRH is a major regulator of the HPA axis/stress axis.
* CRH Regulates secretion of [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH).
* CRH is widely distributed in the brain and periphery
* CRH also regulates the actions of the [[Autonomic nervous system]] ANS and immune system.

Furthermore, stressors that enhance the release of CRH suppress the function of the immune system; conversely, stressors that depress CRH release potentiate immunity.
* Central mediated since peripheral administration of CRH antagonist does not affect immunosuppression.

[[Glutamate|Glutamate agonists]], cytokine inhibitors, [[TRPV1|vanilloid-receptor agonists]], catecholamine modulators, [[Ion channel|ion-channel blockers]], [[anticonvulsants]], [[GABA|GABA agonists]] (including [[opioids]] and [[cannabinoids]]), [[Cyclooxygenase|COX inhibitors]], [[Acetylcholine|acetylcholine modulators]], [[melatonin]] analogs (such as [[Rozerem|Ramelton]]), [[Adenosine receptor|adenosine receptor antagonists]] and several miscellaneous drugs (including biologics like [[Passiflora edulis]]) are being studied for their psychoneuroimmunological effects.

For example, [[SSRI]]s, [[SNRI]]s and [[tricyclic]] [[antidepressants]] acting on [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]] and [[cannabinoid receptor]]s have been shown to be immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory against pro-inflammatory cytokine processes, specifically on the regulation of IFN-gamma and IL-10, as well as TNF-alpha and IL-6 through a psychoneuroimmunological process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kubera M, Lin AH, Kenis G, Bosmans E, van Bockstaele D, Maes M | date = Apr 2001 | title = Anti-Inflammatory effects of antidepressants through suppression of the interferon-gamma/interleukin-10 production ratio | url = | journal = J Clin Psychopharmacol | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 199–206 | doi=10.1097/00004714-200104000-00012 | pmid=11270917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Maes M."The immunoregulatory effects of antidepressants".

Tricyclic and dual serotonergic-noradrenergic reuptake inhibition by SNRIs (or SSRI-NRI combinations), have also shown [[analgesic]] properties additionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moulin DE, Clark AJ, Gilron I, Ware MA, Watson CP, Sessle BJ, Coderre T, Morley-Forster PK, Stinson J, Boulanger A, Peng P, Finley GA, Taenzer P, Squire P, Dion D, Cholkan A, Gilani A, Gordon A, Henry J, Jovey R, Lynch M, Mailis-Gagnon A, Panju A, Rollman GB, Velly A | date = Spring 2007 | title = Pharmacological management of chronic neuropathic pain - consensus statement and guidelines from the Canadian Pain Society | url = | journal = Pain Res Manag | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 13–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones CK, Eastwood BJ, Need AB, Shannon HE | date = Dec 2006 | title = Analgesic effects of serotonergic, noradrenergic or dual reuptake inhibitors in the carrageenan test in rats: evidence for synergism between serotonergic and noradrenergic reuptake inhibition | url = | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 51 | issue = 7-8| pages = 1172–80 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2006.08.005 | pmid=17045620}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent evidences antidepressants also seem to exert beneficial effects in experimental autoimmune [[neuritis]] in rats by decreasing [[Interferon-beta]] (IFN-beta) release or augmenting NK activity in depressed patients.&lt;ref name = Covelli/&gt;

These studies warrant investigation of antidepressants for use in both psychiatric and non-psychiatric illness and that a psychoneuroimmunological approach may be required for optimal [[pharmacotherapy]] in many diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kulmatycki KM, Jamali F | year = 2006 | title = Drug disease interactions: role of inflammatory mediators in depression and variability in antidepressant drug response | url = | journal = J Pharm Pharm Sci. | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 292–306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Future antidepressants may be made to specifically target the immune system by either blocking the actions of pro-inflammatory cytokines or increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Brien SM, Scott LV, Dinan TG | date = Aug 2004 | title = Cytokines: abnormalities in major depression and implications for pharmacological treatment | url = | journal = Hum Psychopharmacol | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 397–403 | doi=10.1002/hup.609 | pmid=15303243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[endocannabinoid system]] appears to play a significant role in the mechanism of action of clinically effective and potential antidepressants and may serve as a target for drug design and discovery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Endocannabinoids|endocannabinoid]]-induced modulation of stress-related behaviors appears to be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of the serotoninergic system, by which cannabinoid [[Cannabinoid receptor type 1|CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] receptors modulate the excitability of [[Dorsal raphe nucleus|dorsal raphe]] serotonin [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haj-Dahmane|first=Samir|last2=Shen|first2=Roh-Yu|date=September 2011|title=Modulation of the Serotonin System by Endocannabinoid Signaling|journal=Neuropharmacology|volume=61|issue=3|pages=414–420|doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.02.016|issn=0028-3908|pmc=3110547|pmid=21354188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data suggest that the endocannabinoid system in [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] and subcortical structures is differentially altered in an animal model of depression and that the effects of chronic, unpredictable stress (CUS) on CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor binding site density are attenuated by antidepressant treatment while those on endocannabinoid content are not.

The increase in amygdalar CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor binding following imipramine treatment is consistent with prior studies which collectively demonstrate that several treatments which are beneficial to depression, such as [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive shock]] and tricyclic antidepressant treatment, increase CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activity in [[Cerebral cortex|subcortical]] [[Limbic system|limbic structures]], such as the [[hippocampus]], [[amygdala]] and [[hypothalamus]].

Extrapolating from the observations that positive emotional experiences boost the immune system, Roberts speculates that intensely positive emotional experiences —sometimes brought about during mystical experiences occasioned by psychedelic medicines—may boost the immune system powerfully. Research on salivary IgA supports this hypothesis, but experimental testing has not been done.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Thomas B. (2006).

'''Sclereids''' are a reduced form of [[sclerenchyma]] cells with highly thickened, lignified [[cell wall|cellular walls]] that form  small bundles of durable layers of tissue in most [[plant]]s.&lt;ref name="RayEic"&gt;Evert, Ray F; Eichhorn, Susan E. Esau's Plant Anatomy: Meristems, Cells, and Tissues of the Plant Body: Their Structure, Function, and Development. Publisher: Wiley-Liss 2006. {{ISBN|978-0471738435}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of numerous sclereids form the cores of [[apple]]s and produce the gritty texture of [[guava]]s.

Although sclereids are variable in shape, the cells are generally isodiametric, prosenchymatic, forked, or elaborately branched. They can be grouped into bundles, can form complete tubes located at the periphery, or can occur as single cells or small groups of cells within [[parenchyma]] tissues. An isolated sclereid cell is known as an idioblast. Sclereids are typically found in the [[epidermis]], [[ground tissue]], and [[vascular tissue]].&lt;ref name=PlantAnat&gt;{{cite book |title=Anatomy of Seed Plants |series=Plant Anatomy |edition=2nd |author=Katherine Easu |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=72 |year= 1977 |isbn=0-471-24520-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "sclereid" was introduced by [[Alexander Tschirch]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Tschirch, A. (1885). Beiträge zur Kenntnis des mechanischen Gewebesystems der Pflanzen. ''Pringsheims Jahrbücher für Wissenschaftliche Botanik'' XVI: 303-335.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

Sclereids are created through belated [[sclerenchyma|sclerosis]] of [[parenchyma]] cells or can arise from sclereid primordia that are individualized early in development. Sclerification typically involves thickening of the cell wall, increasing rigidity. In the [[phloem]], when tissue ceases to function in conduction cells may begin sclerification. In vascular tissue, sclereids will develop from [[Cambium|cambial]] and procambial cells.&lt;ref name=Under&gt;{{cite book |title= Understanding Plant Anatomy |author= S. R. Mishra |publisher= Discovery Publishing House |year= 2009 |isbn= 9788183564571 |page= 105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stem sclereids==

In the vascular region of the stem of ''[[Hoya carnosa]]'', a column of sclereids can be found, and in the [[pith]] of stems of ''[[Hoya]]'' and ''[[Podocarpus]]'' groups of sclereids can be found. These are sclereids with thick cell walls and numerous [[Pit (botany)|pits]], resembling adjacent parenchyma cells. This resemblance suggests that these sclereids are originally [[parenchyma]] cells, but are so sclerified that they are now sclereid cells rather than parenchyma cells. These sclereids are an example of brachysclereids, or stone cells.&lt;ref name=PlantAnat/&gt;

==Leaf sclereids==
[[File:Dionysia kossinskyi sclereids.TIF|thumb|right|Long tapered sclereids supporting a leaf edge in ''Dionysia kossinskyi'']]

Leaves contain a variety of types of sclereids. In the [[mesophyll]], two distinct sclereid structures are found. Sclereids in a diffuse pattern are dispersed throughout the leaf tissue, and sclereids in a terminal pattern are concentrated about the tips of [[leaf veins]]. Sclereid formations in leaves include the branched sclereids of ''[[Trochodendron]]'', the columnar sclereids of ''[[Hakea]]'', and the hair-like trichosclereids that branch into air chambers within the leaves of the [[Nymphaea|water lily]] and [[Nuphar|yellow pond lily]]. Sclereids can also form part of or the entire epidermis of [[foliar]] structures such as the clove scales of ''[[Allium sativum]]''.&lt;ref name=PlantAnat/&gt;

Especially interesting are the sclereids in [[Olea europaea|olive]] leaves. They are typically {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}} in length and are thus named fiberlike sclereids. These sclereids permeate the mesophyll as a dense mat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series= University Botany |title= Gymnosperms, Plant Anatomy, Genetics, Ecology |volume= 2 |author= S. M. Reddy, S. J. Chary |publisher= New Age International |year= 2003 |isbn= 9788122414776 |page= 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; During sclerification these fiberlike sclereid cells can increase by several hundred times their original size, compared to other parenchyma cells that only increase by two or three times.&lt;ref name=Under/&gt;

==Fruit sclereids==

Sclereids in fruits vary in form and use. In [[pear]]s, sclereids from concentric clusters that grow about earlier formed sclereids. These pear sclereids, as well as sclereids within [[quince]] fruit, often form [[Pit (botany)#Types of pits|bordered pits]] when the cell wall increases in thickness during sclerification. In [[apple]]s, layers of elongated sclereids form the [[endocarp]] that encloses the seeds.&lt;ref name=PlantAnat/&gt;

==Seed sclereids==

The hardening of seed coats during ripening often occurs through sclerification, when the secondary cell walls are thickened in the epidermis and below the epidermis. [[Legume|Leguminous]] seeds are examples of such sclerification. Larger sclereids form columns in the epidermis of [[Pisum|pea]], [[Phaseolus|bean]], and [[Glycine (genus)|soybean]] seeds, and bone-shaped osteosclereids occur beneath the epidermis. In the seedcoats of [[Cocos nucifera|coconut]]s, sclereids possess numerous bordered pits.&lt;ref name=PlantAnat/&gt; These larger macrosclereids found in seedcoats are of [[wikt:protoderm|protodermal]] origin.&lt;ref name=Under/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2795">'''Steklov Institute of Mathematics''' or '''Steklov Mathematical Institute''' ({{lang-ru|Математический институт имени В.А.Стеклова}}) is a premier research institute based in [[Moscow]], specialized in [[mathematics]], and a part of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. The institute is named after [[Vladimir Andreevich Steklov]], who in 1919 founded the Institute of Physics and Mathematics in  [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. In 1934, this institute was split into separate parts for physics and mathematics, and the mathematical part became the Steklov Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Russian Mathematicians in the 20th Century|first=Yakov|last=Sinai|authorlink=Yakov Sinai|publisher=World Scientific|year=2003|isbn=9789812383853|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFsnWXkqZaMC&amp;pg=PA38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it was moved to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sinai|2003}}, pp. 530 and 697.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first director of the Steklov Institute was [[Ivan Matveyevich Vinogradov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sinai|2003}}, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1961-1964, the institute's director was the notable mathematician [[Sergei Chernikov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ershov|first1=Y.L. et al.|title=Sergei Nikolaevich Chernikov (obituary)|journal=Russian Math.

The old building of the Institute in Leningrad became its Department in Leningrad. Today, that department has become a separate institute, called the ''[[St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences]]'' or '''PDMI RAS''', located in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. The name ''St. Petersburg Department'' is misleading, however, because the St. Petersburg Department is now an independent institute. In 1966, the Moscow-based [[Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics]] (Russian: Институт прикладной математики им. М.В.Келдыша) split off from the Steklov Institute.

'''Synchrony''' and '''diachrony''' are two different and complementary viewpoints in [[linguistic]] analysis. A synchronic approach (from Greek συν- "together" and χρόνος "time") considers a language at a moment in time without taking its history into account. Synchronic linguistics aims at describing a language at a specific point of time, usually the present. By contrast, a [[historic linguistics|diachronic]] approach (from δια- "through" and χρόνος "time") considers the development and evolution of a language through history. [[Historical linguistics]] is typically a diachronic study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9027272077 |title=Synchrony and Diachrony: A dynamic interface |editor1-last=Giacalone Ramat |editor1-first=Anna |editor2-last=Mauri |editor2-first=Caterina |editor3-last=Molinelli |editor3-first=Piera |isbn=9027272077 |pages=17, 18 |publisher=John Benjamins North America |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |date=2013 |access-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts were theorized by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], professor of general linguistics in [[Geneva]] from 1896 to 1911, and appeared in writing in his posthumous ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' published in 1916. In contrast with most of his predecessors, who focused on historical evolution of languages, Saussure emphasized the primacy of synchronic analysis of languages to understand their inner functioning, though never forgetting the importance of complementary diachrony. This dualistic opposition has been carried over into [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]], for instance by [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. [[Jacques Lacan]] also used it for [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Four_Fundamental_Concepts_of_Psycho.html?id=5guFfqA6l0UC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis |author-last=Lacan |author-first=Jacques |editor1-last=Miller |editor1-first=Jacques-Alain |isbn=0393317757 |pages=46 |publisher=Éditions du Seuil |location=France |date=1978 |access-date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to de Saussure, many similar concepts were also developed independently by [[Poland|Polish]] linguists [[Jan Baudouin de Courtenay]] and [[Mikołaj Kruszewski]] of the [[Kazan school]], who used the terms '''statics''' and '''dynamics''' of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=BQfDosHckzEC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics |author-last=Allan |author-first=Keith  |isbn= 9780199585847 |pages=172 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=United Kingdom |date=2013 |access-date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''tetrad''' is the four [[spore]]s produced after [[meiosis]] of a [[yeast]] or other [[Ascomycota]], ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'' or other alga, or a [[plant]]. After parent haploids mate, they produce diploids. Under appropriate environmental conditions, diploids sporulate and undergo meiosis. The meiotic products, spores, remain packaged in the parental cell body to produce the tetrad.

If the two parents have a mutation in two different genes, the tetrad can segregate these genes as the parental ditype ([[#Parental ditype|PD]]), the non-parental ditype (NPD) or as the tetratype (TT).&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, D.D. (1962) Crossing-over and interference in a multiply marked chromosome arm of Neurosopora. Genetics 47, 1253-1274.[http://www.genetics.org/content/47/9/1253.long ] {{PMID|13942437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parental ditype is a tetrad type containing two different [[genotypes]], both of which are parental. A spore arrangement in [[Ascomycetes]] that contains only the two non-recombinant-type [[ascospores]].

Non-parental ditype is a non-parental ditype (NPD) is a spore that contains only the two recombinant-type [[ascospores]] (assuming two segregating loci). A tetrad type containing two different genotypes, both of which are recombinant.

Tetratype is a tetrad containing four different genotypes, two parental and two recombinant. A spore arrangement in Ascomycetes that consists of two parental and two recombinant spores indicates a single crossover between two linked loci.

===Linkage analysis===
The ratio between the different segregation types arising after the sporulation is a measure of the [[genetic linkage|linkage]] between the two genes.

==Tetrad dissection==
'''Tetrad dissection''' has become a powerful tool of yeast geneticists, and is used in conjunction with the many established procedures utilizing the versatility of yeasts as [[model organism]]s. Use of modern [[microscopy]] and [[micromanipulator|micromanipulation]] techniques allows the four haploid spores of a yeast tetrad to be separated and germinated individually to form isolated spore colonies.

===Uses===
Tetrad analysis can be used to confirm whether a phenotype is caused by a specific mutation, construction of strains, and for investigating gene interaction. Since the frequency of tetrad segregation types is influenced by the recombination frequency for the two markers, the segregation data can be used to calculate the genetic distance between the markers if they are close on the same chromosome.
Tetrad analyses have also contributed to detection and study of the phenomena of gene conversion and post-meiotic segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse, HLK. Genetic Recombination. New York: Wiley; 1982. {{ISBN|978-0471102052}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies have proven central to understanding the mechanism of meiotic recombination, which in turn is a key to understanding the adaptive function of sexual reproduction.  The use of tetrads in fine-structure genetic analysis is described in the articles ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'' and [[Gene conversion]].

===General procedure===
Crosses are performed between haploid MATa and MATα mating strains, then the resulting diploids are transferred to sporulation media to form a tetrad containing four haploid spores. Tetrads can then be prepared with Zymolyase, or another enzyme, to digest the wall of the ascus. The spores are then separated with a micromanipulator needle and deposited in separate positions on a [[petri dish]].

===Tools===
Traditionally, tetrad dissection has a reputation as  "black art".&lt;ref&gt;Yeast Protocols: Methods in Cell and Molecular Biology, Ivor Howell Evan, Published by Humana Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-89603-319-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-89603-319-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, instruments have since been developed specifically for tetrad dissection; the most advanced allow easy and semi-automated separation of tetrads. Most micromanipulators use a glass fiber needle to which the spores adhere due to the formation of a water [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] between the [[agar]] and the needle.

'''''The Rap Year Book: The Most Important Rap Song From Every Year Since 1979, Discussed, Debated, and Deconstructed''''' is a 2015 ''[[New York Times]]'' best-selling book written by [[Shea Serrano]] and illustrated by [[Arturo Torres (artist)|Arturo Torres]].

==Development==
''The Rap Year Book'' followed Serrano's 2013 project with [[Houston]] rapper [[Bun B]], ''Bun B's Rap Coloring and Activity Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bacher|first1=Danielle|title=Q&amp;A: Bun B on the 'Incredible Journey' of Creating His Hip-Hop Coloring Book|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-bun-b-on-the-incredible-journey-of-creating-his-hip-hop-coloring-book-20130618|accessdate=26 August 2016|work=Rolling Stone|date=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rap Year Book'' took 15 months to develop,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Euse|first1=Erica|title=How 'The Rap Year Book' Breaks Down the Most Important Rap Songs for Each Year Since 1979|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2015/10/a-look-inside-the-rap-year-book|accessdate=27 August 2016|work=Complex|date=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was still without an illustrator three months before the book's due date. Serrano encountered eventual collaborator Torres via a flyer Torres had designed announcing a performance by [[Dallas]] rap group The Outfit, Texas; Serrano told ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' that on seeing Torres's work, he thought immediately, "This is the exact style that I’m trying to find."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Dan|title=Music Monday: Shea Serrano On 'The Rap Yearbook' And His Houston Hip Hop Playlist|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/music-monday-shea-serrano-on-the-rap-yearbook-and-his-houston-hip-hop-playlist/|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=Texas Monthly|date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serrano contacted the group's management asking for information about who had made their flyer and eventually tracked Torres down on social media; Torres agreed to work on the book.

==Publication==
''The Rap Year Book'' was published on October 13, 2015, by [[Abrams Image]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schiewe|first1=Jessie|title=Here's How One Writer Spent Way Too Long Deciding the Best Rap Song Every Year from 1979 to 2014 {{!}} NOISEY|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/shea-serrano-interview-rap-yearbook|accessdate=26 August 2016|work=Noisey|publisher=Vice|date=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is 240 pages with 150 full-color illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rap Year Book The Most Important Rap Song From Every Year Since 1979, Discussed, Debated, and Deconstructed|url=https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/rap-year-book_9781419718182/|website=Abrams Books|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The book is structured around essays by Serrano selecting the most important rap song for every year from 1979 to 2014.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; His text is accompanied by illustrations by Torres, "bright, colorful, and offbeat cartoons...featuring depictions of [[Kanye]] and [[Jay-Z]] on a movie poster, [[Dr. Dre]] in scrubs, [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] using a pottery wheel, and more."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Colin|title='The Rap Year Book' Reformats Hip-Hop History|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/the-rap-year-book-by-shea-serrano/|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=PopMatters|date=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ice-T]] wrote the book's preface,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and critics, including [[Wesley Morris]] and [[Jessica Hopper]], contributed short rebuttals arguing for alternative choices as the most important song of a given year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Reception==

===Sales===
Propelled by Serrano's engagement with his enthusiastic [[Twitter]] following,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Locke|first1=Charley|title=How One Man and His Twitter Army Stormed the Bestseller List|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/rap-year-book-best-seller/|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=Wired|date=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rap Year Book'' repeatedly ranked on 2015 ''The New York Times'' best-seller lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tiffany|first1=Kaitlyn|title=The Rap Yearbook author Shea Serrano on building a tiny utopia on Twitter|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/6/12067954/shea-serrano-the-rap-yearbook-twitter-interview|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=The Verge|date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's first pressing of 20,000 copies sold out in pre-orders before ''The Rap Year Book'' even hit shelves;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crucchiola|first1=Jordan|title=The King Of Twitter: Shea Serrano Is Our New Favorite Internet Hero|url=https://www.good.is/articles/shea-serrano-basketball-and-other-things|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=GOOD|date=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mock "feud" on Twitter between Serrano and [[Books-a-Million]] sold out the retailer's stock of the book in one day, and crashed the company's website in the process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Reviews===
''[[PopMatters]]'' reviewed the book as "both educationally useful and shamelessly fun...tailor-made to counter every criticism levied against routine, overly generalized music retrospectives."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'', Oliver Wang said that while Serrano's essays take a position on what constitutes the most important song of each year, "he doesn’t browbeat his reader into agreement; he writes confidently but not condescendingly. More importantly, the main pleasure in reading ''The Rap Year Book'' isn’t in agreeing with Serrano’s choices but rather in following the elliptical paths he takes to explain them."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Oliver|title=Top Five, Dead or Alive|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/top-five-dead-or-alive/|accessdate=26 August 2016|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|date=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation==
In July 2017, Serrano announced that AMC would produce ''The Rap Year Book'' as a 6-part television documentary series with The Roots as executive producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Darville|first1=Jordan|title=Shea Serrano’s The Rap Yearbook To Be Made Into An AMC Documentary Series|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/07/31/the-rap-yearbook-documentary|accessdate=29 July 2017|work=The Fader|date=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ticio Escobar''' is a [[Paraguay]]an lawyer, academic, author, museum director, and former Minister of Culture of Paraguay.&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt; He has championed the rights of [[Indigenous peoples of Paraguay]], writing about and curating shows on the topic.

== Early life and education ==
Escobar was born on February 9, 1947, in [[Asunción]]. His father was jurist Jorge H. Escobar, and his mother is María Rosalba Argaña Ferraro.&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt; He graduated in Law at the [[Universidad Católica Nuestra Señora de la Asunción]] in 1970. Five years later, in 1974, he obtained his [[Master's degree]] (''licencia'') here in [[Philosophy]]. During his study, he was a member of the Comisión de Defensa de los Derechos Humanos en el Paraguay, a [[human rights]] group.&lt;ref name="docPCF"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://www.princeclausfund.nl/urbanheroes/escobar/TICIO.doc biography] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UH-PCF"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://www.princeclausfund.nl/urbanheroes/escobar/eng/index.htm ''Urban Heroes'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Between 1971 and 1989, Escobar was a university professor in the fields of [[philosophy of law]], [[mathematical logic]], [[philosophical anthropology]], [[history of art]] and [[art criticism]].&lt;ref name="AQE"&gt;A Quienes Elegimos, [http://www.aquieneselegimos.org.py/dat/679-cv1-1(ul).doc Curriculum Vitae] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1980, he was an art reviewer for the Museo Paraguayo de Arte Contemporáneo. In 1979 he founded the [[Museo del Barro]] (museum of pottery) in Asunción, with the objective to preserve Paraguayan culture. The same year he also founded the Museo de Arte Indígena, Centro de Artes Visuales (museum for indigenous art, center of visual art). To this museum, of which he was also the director until 2008, he donated his own art collection.&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt;&lt;ref name="UH-PCF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AQE" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://www.princeclausfund.org/en/network/user/id/344 profile]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts and activism==
Between 1978 and 1988, Escobar was the curator for Paraguay at the Biennale of [[São Paulo]]. Furthermore, he was curator for several versions of the [[Venice Biennale]] and the biennales of [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Lima]] and [[Porto Alegre]], and for a number of expositions in [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]]. At the beginning of the 1990s, he joined two movements for [[Indigenous peoples' rights]]: the Asociación Indigenista del Paraguay and the Asociación Apoyo a las Comunidades Indígenas del Paraguay (ACIP).&lt;ref name="docPCF" /&gt;

From 1991-1996 he was Director of Culture of the city of Asunción.&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt; In 1996 he won a national contest to edit a bill on culture, which was later adopted by parliament as ''Ley Escobar 3051/06''. From 2008-2013 he was the Minister of Culture of the government of [[Fernando Lugo]].&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt;&lt;ref name="docPCF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UH-PCF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBA"&gt;Circulo de Bellas Artes, [http://www.circulobellasartes.com/ficha.php?s=fich_bio&amp;id=653 biography] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Habana Radio (11 February 2011) [http://www.habanaradio.cu/singlefile_news/?id_not=20110211163053 ''Ticio Escobar, el crítico devenido Ministro''] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130412053822/http://www.habanaradio.cu/singlefile_news/?id_not=20110211163053 |date=2013-04-12 }} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a chairman of the Paraguayan section of the [[International Association of Art Critics]], and has written more than ten books.&lt;ref name="docPCF" /&gt;

[[File:060 Cave 4, Main Shrine (34280369085).jpg|thumb|5th century Cave 4 at the [[Ajanta Caves]] with a Buddha statue in the centre shrine cell.]]
'''Vihara''' ({{lang-sa|vihāra}}) generally refers to a [[monastery]] for [[bhikkhu|Buddhist renunciates]]. The concept is ancient and in early [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] texts, it meant any arrangement of space or facilities for pleasure and entertainment.&lt;ref name=mmwvihara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lahiri2015p181"/&gt; The term evolved into an architectural concept wherein it refers to living quarters for monks with an open shared space or courtyard, particularly in Buddhism. The term is also found in Ajivika, Hindu and Jain monastic literature, usually referring to temporary refuge for wandering monks or nuns during the annual Indian monsoons.&lt;ref name=mmwvihara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1946p137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p203"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-134-50165-X|pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern Jainism, the monks continue to wander from town to town except during the rainy season ([[Chaturmas#Jainism|Chaturmas]]), the term "vihara" refers their wanderings.&lt;ref&gt;Gomaṭeśvara sahasrābdī mahotsava darśana, Niraj Jain, Śravaṇabelagola Digambara Jaina Muzaraī Insṭīṭyuśaṃsa Mainejiṅga Kameṭī, 1984, Page 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulasī prajñā, Jaina Viśva Bhāratī., 1984, Page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Vihara or vihara hall has a more specific meaning in the [[architecture of India]], especially ancient [[Indian rock-cut architecture]].  Here it means a central hall, with small cells connected to it sometimes with beds carved from the stone. Some have a shrine cell set back at the centre of the back wall, containing a [[stupa]] in early examples, or a Buddha statue later. Typical large sites such as the [[Ajanta Caves]], [[Aurangabad Caves]], [[Karla Caves|Karli Caves]], and [[Kanheri Caves]] contain several viharas. Some included a [[chaitya]] or worship hall nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, George, ''The Penguin Guide to the Monuments of India, Volume 1: Buddhist, Jain, Hindu'', p. 67 and see individual entries, 1989, Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140081445}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vihara was originated to be a shelter for Monks when it rains.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
Vihāra is a Sanskrit word that appears in several Vedic texts with context sensitive meanings. It generally means a form of "distribution, transposition, separation, arrangement", either of words or sacred fires or sacrificial ground. Alternatively, it refers to a form of wandering roaming, any place to rest or please oneself or enjoy one's pastime in, a meaning more common in late Vedic texts, the Epics and Gryhasutra literature.&lt;ref name=mmwvihara&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/1000/mw__1036.html Vihara], Monier Monier Williams, Sanskrit-English Dictionary Etymologically Arranged, Oxford University Press, page 1003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hermann Oldenberg|author2=Friedrich Max Müller|title=The Grihya-sûtras, Rules of Vedic Domestic Ceremonies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xBWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA330|year=1892|publisher=Clarendon Press: Oxford|pages=54–56, 330–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith1998p151"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian K.

Its meaning in post-Vedic era is more specifically a form of rest house or temple or monastery in ascetic traditions of India, particularly for a group of monks.&lt;ref name=mmwvihara/&gt; It particularly referred to a hall that were used as temples or where monks met and some walked about.&lt;ref name=mmwvihara/&gt;&lt;ref name=palivihara/&gt; In performance arts context, the term means the theatre, playhouse, convent or temple compound to meet, perform or relax in. Later it referred to a form of temple or monastery construction in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, wherein the design has a central hall and attached separated shrines for residence either for monks or for gods, goddesses and some sacred figure such as Tirthankaras or the Buddha or a Guru. The word means a Jain or Hindu temple or "dwelling, waiting place" in many medieval era inscriptions and texts, from ''vi-har'' which means "to construct".&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1946p137"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Hindu Temple|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNcXrBlI9S0C&amp;pg=PA137|year=1946|publisher=Princeton University Press (Reprint: Motilal Banarsidass)|isbn=978-81-208-0223-0|pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p203"/&gt;

The northern [[India]]n state of [[Bihar]] derives its name from the word "vihara", due to the abundance of Buddhist monasteries in that area. The word "vihara" has also been borrowed in [[Malay language|Malay]] where it is spelled "biara," and denotes a monastery or other non-Muslim place of worship. In [[Thailand]] and [[China]] (called ''{{lang|zh-Latn|jingshe}}''; {{zh|精舎}}), "vihara" has a narrower meaning, and designates a [[shrine]] hall or retreat house.  It is called a "Wihan" ({{lang|th|วิหาร}}) in Thai, and a "Vihear" in [[Khmer language|Khmer]]. In [[Burmese language|Burmese]], ''wihara'' ({{my|ဝိဟာရ}}, {{IPA-my|wḭhəɹa̰|IPA}}), means "monastery," but the native Burmese word ''[[kyaung]]'' ({{my|ကျောင်း}}, {{IPA-my|tɕáʊɴ|IPA}}) is preferred. Monks wandering from place to place preaching and seeking [[alms]] often stayed together in the [[sangha]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  In the [[Punjabi language]], an open space inside a home is called a 'vehra'.

==Origins==
[[File:Ellora Cave 12 si0253.jpg|thumb|Cave 12, [[Ellora]], a late multi-story rock-cut vihara.  Further decoration of the pillars was probably intended.]]

===Viharas as pleasure centers===
During the 3rd-century BCE era of [[Ashoka]], ''vihara yatras'' were travels aimed at enjoyments, pleasures and hobbies such as hunting. These contrasted with ''dharma yatras'' which related to religious pursuits and pilgrimage.&lt;ref name="Lahiri2015p181"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nayanjot Lahiri|title=Ashoka in Ancient India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaVRCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-91525-1|pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ashoka converted to Buddhism, states Lahiri, he started ''dharma yatras'' around mid 3rd century BCE instead of hedonistic royal ''vihara yatras''.&lt;ref name="Lahiri2015p181"/&gt;

===Viharas as monasteries===
The early history of viharas is unclear. Monasteries in the form of caves are dated to centuries before the start of the common era, for [[Ajivika]]s, [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]s and [[Jainism|Jaina]]s. The rock-cut architecture found in cave viharas from the 2nd-century BCE have roots in the [[Maurya Empire]] period.&lt;ref name="AllchinErdosy1995"/&gt; In and around the [[Bihar]] state of India are a group of residential cave monuments all dated to be from pre-common era, reflecting the Maurya architecture. Some of these have Brahmi script inscription which confirms their antiquity, but the inscriptions were likely added to pre-existing caves.&lt;ref name="AllchinErdosy1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. R. Allchin|author2=George Erdosy|title=The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q5kI02_zW70C |year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37695-2|pages=247–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest layer of Buddhist and Jain texts mention legends of the Buddha, the Jain Tirthankaras or [[sramana]] monks living in caves.&lt;ref name="AllchinErdosy1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gwynne2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gwynne|title=World Religions in Practice: A Comparative Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sU8nDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51|date=30 May 2017|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-97228-1|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jain1991p66"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kailash Chand Jain|title=Lord Mahāvīra and His Times|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8-TxcO9dfrcC&amp;pg=PA66|year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0805-8|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; If these records derived from an [[oral tradition]] accurately reflect the significance of monks and caves in the times of the Buddha and the Mahavira, then cave residence tradition dates back to at least the 5th century BCE. According to Allchin and Erdosy, the legend of First Buddhist Council is dated to a period just after the death of the Buddha. It mentions monks gathering at a cave near Rajgiri, and this dates it in pre-Mauryan times.&lt;ref name="AllchinErdosy1995"/&gt; However, the square courtyard with cells architecture of ''vihara'', state Allchin and Erdosy, is dated to the Mauryan period. The earlier monastic residences of Ajivikas, Buddhists, Hindus, and Jains were likely outside rock cliffs and made of temporary materials and these have not survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. R. Allchin|author2=George Erdosy|title=The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q5kI02_zW70C |year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37695-2|pages=240–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known gift of immovable property for monastic purposes ever recorded in an Indian inscription is credited to Emperor Ashoka, and it is a donation to the Ajivikas.&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2011p96"/&gt; According to Johannes Bronkhorst, this created competitive financial pressures on all traditions, including the Hindu Brahmins. This may have led to the development of viharas as shelters for monks, and evolution in the [[Ashrama (stage)|Ashrama]] concept to ''agraharas'' or Hindu monasteries. These shelters were normally accompanied by donation of revenue from villages nearby, who would work and support these cave residences with food and services. The Karle inscription dated to the 1st century CE donates a cave and nearby village, states Bronkhorst, "for the support of the ascetics living in the caves at Valuraka [Karle] without any distinction of sect or origin". Buddhist texts from Bengal, dated to centuries later, use the term ''asrama-vihara'' or ''agrahara-vihara'' for their monasteries.&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2011p96"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst|title=Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BaX58-E5-3MC |year=2011|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-20140-8|pages=96–97 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GrundrissAjantaHoehle1.jpg|thumb|270px|Plan of cave 1 at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], a large ''vihara'' hall for prayer and living, 5th century]]
Buddhist viharas or monasteries may be described as a residence for monks, a centre for religious work and meditation and a centre of Buddhist learning. Reference to five kinds of dwellings (Pancha Lenani) namely, ''Vihara, Addayoga, Pasada, Hammiya'' and ''Guha'' is found in the Buddhist canonical texts as fit for monks. Of these only the ''Vihara'' (monastery) and ''Guha'' (Cave) have survived.

At some stage of Buddhism, like other Indian religious traditions, the wandering monks of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] dedicated to asceticism and the monastic life, wandered from place to place. During the rainy season (cf. [[vassa]]) they stayed in temporary shelters. In Buddhist theology relating to rebirth and merit earning, it was considered an act of merit not only to feed a monk but also to shelter him, sumptuous monasteries were created by rich lay devotees.

==Architecture==
The only substantial remains of very early viharas are in the rock-cut complexes, mostly in north India, the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] in particular, but this is an accident of survival. Originally structural viharas of stone or brick would probably have been at least as common everywhere, and the norm in the south.  By the second century BCE a standard plan for a vihara was established; these form the majority of Buddhist rock-cut "caves".  It consisted of a roughly square rectangular hall, in rock-cut cases, or probably an open court in structural examples, off which there were a number of small cells.  Rock-cut cells are often fitted with rock-cut platforms for beds and pillows.  The front wall had one or more entrances, and often a [[verandah]].  Later the back wall facing the entrance had a fairly small shrine-room, often reached through an ante-chamber.  Initially these held [[stupa]]s, but later a large sculpted [[Buddha]] image, sometimes with [[relief]]s on the walls.  The verandah might also have sculpture, and in some cases the walls of the main hall.  Paintings were perhaps more common, but these rarely survive, except in a few cases such as Caves 2, 10, 11 and 17 at the [[Ajanta Caves]].  As later rock-cut viharas are often on up to three storeys, this was also probably the case with the structural ones.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 48, 54-56, 119-120; Michell, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

As the vihara acquired a central image, it came to take over the function of the chaitya worship hall, and eventually these ceased to be built.  This was despite the rock-cut vihara shrine room usually offering no path for circumambulation or [[pradakshina]], an important ritual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 132; Michell, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In early medieval era, Viharas became important institutions and a part of Buddhist [[Universities]] with thousands of students, such as [[Nalanda]].  Life in "Viharas" was codified early on. It is the object of a part of the [[Pali canon]], the [[Vinaya|Vinaya Pitaka]] or "basket of monastic discipline".  [[Shalban Vihara]] in [[Bangladesh]] is an example of a structural monastery with 115 cells, where the lower parts of the brick-built structure have been excavated. [[Somapura Mahavihara]], also in Bangladesh, was a larger vihara, mostly 8th-century, with 177 cells around a huge central temple.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
[[File:094 Cave 12, Vihara Cells (34123037202).jpg|thumb|Cave 12, [[Ajanta Caves]], cell entries off a vihara hall]]

===Variants in rock-cut viharas===
Usually the standard form as described above is followed, but there are some variants. Two vihara halls, Cave 5 at [[Ellora]] and Cave 11 at [[Kanheri]], have very low platforms running most of the length of the main hall. These were probably used as some combination of benches or tables for dining, desks for study, and possibly beds.  They are often termed "dining-hall" or the "[[Durbar Hall]]" at Kanheri, on no good evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 359, 374&lt;/ref&gt;

Cave 11 at the Bedse Caves is a fairly small 1st-century vihara, with nine cells in the interior and originally four around the entrance, and no shrine room.  It is distinguished by elaborate [[gavaksha]] and railing relief carving around the cell-doors, but especially by having a rounded roof and [[apse|apsidal]] far end, like a [[chaitya]] hall.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 351-352&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Mahabodhitemple.jpg|300px|thumb|Mahabodhi Temple|[[Mahabodhi Temple]] in India.]]

The earliest Buddhist rock-cut cave abodes and sacred places are found in the western [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] dating back to the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name="binda"&gt;{{cite book| first= Binda| last= Thapar| year= 2004| title= Introduction to Indian Architecture| edition=| publisher= Periplus Editions| location=Singapore| page= 34| isbn=  0-7946-0011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These earliest rock-cut caves include the [[Bhaja Caves]], the [[Karla Caves]], and some of the [[Ajanta Caves]].

Vihara with central shrine containing devotional images of the Buddha, dated to about the 2nd century CE are found in the northwestern area of [[Gandhara]], in sites such as [[Jaulian]], [[Kalawan]] (in the [[Taxila]] area) or [[Dharmarajika]], which states Behrendt, possibly were the prototypes for the 4th century monasteries such as those at [[Devnimori]] in [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="Behrendt 170"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Behrendt| first1=Kurt A.|title=Handbuch der Orientalistik|date=2004| publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004135952| pages=168–171|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9_vbgkzUSkC&amp;pg=PA168|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by the discovery of clay and bronze Buddha statues, but it is unclear if the statue is of a later date.&lt;ref name="Behrendt 170"/&gt; According to Behrendt, these "must have been the architectural prototype for the later northern and western Buddhist shrines in the [[Ajanta Caves]], [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Ellora]], [[Nalanda]], [[Ratnagiri]] and other sites".&lt;ref name="Behrendt 170"/&gt; Behrendt's proposal follows the model that states the northwestern influences and Kushana era during the 1st and 2nd century CE triggered the development of Buddhist art and monastery designs. In contrast, Susan Huntington states that this late nineteenth and early twentieth century model is increasingly questioned by the discovery of pre-Kushana era Buddha images outside the northwestern territories. Further, states Huntington, "archaeological, literary, and inscriptional evidence" such as those in Madhya Pradesh cast further doubts.&lt;ref name=huntington401&gt;Susan L. Huntington (1990), Early Buddhist Art and the Theory of Aniconism, Art Journal, Volume 49, 1990 - Issue 4: New Approaches to South Asian Art, pages 401-408&lt;/ref&gt; Devotional worship of Buddha is traceable, for example, to Bharhut Buddhist monuments dated between 2nd and 1st century BCE.&lt;ref name=huntington401/&gt; The [[Pandavleni Caves|Krishna or Kanha Cave]] (Cave 19) at Nasik has the central hall with connected cells, and it is generally dated to about the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Himanshu Prabha Ray|title=Archaeology and Buddhism in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-wrDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT66|year=2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-39432-1|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pia Brancaccio|title=The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C |year=2010|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-18525-9|pages=61 with footnote 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early stone viharas mimicked the timber construction that likely preceded them.&lt;ref name="art"&gt;{{cite web

Inscriptional evidence on stone and copper plates indicate that Buddhist viharas were often co-built with Hindu and Jain temples. The [[Gupta Empire]] era witnessed the building of numerous viharas, including those at the [[Ajanta Caves]].&lt;ref name="Asher1980p15"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick M.

===Viharas as a source of major Buddhist traditions===
As more people joined Buddhist monastic ''sangha'', the senior monks adopted a code of discipline which came to be known in the [[Pali Canon]] as the Vinaya texts.&lt;ref name="Silk2008p137"/&gt; These texts are mostly concerned with the rules of the ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]''. The rules are preceded by stories telling how the Buddha came to lay them down, and followed by explanations and analysis. According to the stories, the rules were devised on an ad hoc basis as the Buddha encountered various behavioral problems or disputes among his followers. Each major early Buddhist tradition had its own variant text of code of discipline for vihara life. Major vihara appointed a ''vihara-pala'', the one who managed the vihara, settled disputes, determined sangha's consent and rules, and forced those hold-outs to this consensus.&lt;ref name="Silk2008p137"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan A.

Three early influential monastic fraternities are traceable in Buddhist history.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p197"/&gt; The Mahavihara established by Mahinda was the oldest. Later, in 1st century BCE, King Vattagamani donated the Abhayagiri vihara to his favored monk, which led the Mahavihara fraternity to expel that monk.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p197"/&gt; In 3rd century CE, this repeated when King Mahasena donated the Jetavana vihara to an individual monk, which led to his expulsion. The Mahinda Mahavihara led to the orthodox Theravada tradition.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p197"/&gt; The Abhayagiri vihara monks, rejected and criticized by the orthodox Buddhist monks, were more receptive to heterodox ideas and they nurtured the Mahayana tradition. The Jetavana vihara monks vacillated between the two traditions, blending their ideas.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p197"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey| title= An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viharas of the Pāla era===

A range of monasteries grew up during the Pāla period in ancient Magadha (modern Bihar) and Bengal. According to Tibetan sources, five great [[mahavihara]]s stood out: [[Vikramashila]], the premier university of the era; [[Nalanda]], past its prime but still illustrious, [[Somapura Mahavihara|Somapura]], [[Odantapuri|Odantapurā]], and [[Jagaddala Mahavihara|Jagaddala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=English |first=Elizabeth |date=2002 |title=Vajrayogini: Her Visualization, Rituals, and Forms |publisher=Wisdom Publications |page=15 |isbn=0-86171-329-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sukumar Dutt, the five monasteries formed a network, were supported and supervised by the Pala state. Each of the five had their own seal and operated like a corporation, serving as centers of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dutt |first=Sukumar |date=1962 |title=Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture |location=London |publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd |pages=352–3 |oclc=372316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable monasteries of the [[Pala Empire]] were Traikuta, Devikota (identified with ancient Kotivarsa, 'modern Bangarh'), and [[Pandit Vihara]]. Excavations jointly conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India and University of Burdwan in 1971-1972 to 1974-1975 yielded a Buddhist monastic complex at Monorampur, near Bharatpur via Panagarh Bazar in the [[Bardhaman]] district of West Bengal. The date of the monastery may be ascribed to the early medieval period. Recent excavations at [[Jagjivanpur]] (Malda district, West Bengal) revealed another Buddhist monastery (''Nandadirghika-Udranga Mahavihara'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tathyabangla.org.in/public/i_cadeprt/archeology/arch3.asp |title=Jagjivanpur, A newly discovered Buddhist site in west Bengal |publisher=Information &amp; Cultural Affairs Department, Government of West Bengal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809033739/http://www.tathyabangla.org.in/public/i_cadeprt/archeology/arch3.asp |archivedate=9 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the ninth century.

Nothing of the superstructure has survived. A number of monastic cells facing a rectangular courtyard have been found. A notable feature is the presence of circular corner cells. It is believed that the general layout of the monastic complex at Jagjivanpur is by and large similar to that of Nalanda. Beside these, scattered references to some monasteries are found in epigraphic and other sources.  Among them Pullahari (in western Magadha), [[Halud Vihara]] (45&amp;nbsp;km south of Paharpur), Parikramana vihara and Yashovarmapura vihara (in Bihar) deserve mention. Other important structural complexes have been discovered at [[Mainamati]] (Comilla district, Bangladesh). Remains of quite a few viharas have been unearthed here and the most elaborate is the [[Shalban Vihara]]. The complex consists of a fairly large vihara of the usual plan of four ranges of monastic cells round a central court, with a temple in cruciform plan situated in the centre. According to a legend on a seal (discovered at the site) the founder of the monastery was [[Bhavadeva]], a ruler of the Deva dynasty.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Southeast Asia===
[[File:Chiang-Mai Thailand Wat-Chedi-Luang-01.jpg|thumb|Vihara, locally called ''wihan'', of [[Wat Chedi Luang]] in Northern [[Thailand]]]]
As Buddhism spread in southeast Asia, monasteries were built by local kings. The term ''vihara'' referred to the assembly hall of these monasteries. Many of these viharas continue to play an important role in the modern era practice of Theravada Buddhism. For example, during the twelfth lunar month in Thailand, lay Buddhists visit a monastery and circumambulate the vihara and the reliquary as a means to earn merit. Devotees may hold banana boats containing burning incense sticks, flowers, sticky rice and few coins as they complete the circle. These boats are then carried to a local river or pond and set afloat.&lt;ref name="Swearer1995p33"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald K.
