'''Albert Morris''' (13 August 1886 in Bridgetown, [[South Australia]] &amp;ndash; 9 January 1939, [[Broken Hill]]), was a highly acclaimed amateur Australian [[botanist]], [[landscaper]], [[ecologist]], conservationist and pioneer developer of the re-vegetation technique ''natural regeneration'' who also utilised restoration principles that are today known as ''[[ecological restoration]]''. 

==Early life==
Albert was born in Bridgetown, South Australia to parents Albert Joseph Morris and Emma Jane (Smith).&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1986&lt;/ref&gt; His family was confronted with the economic depression in South Australia in the late 1880s, and Morris's father sought work in the new mines of the Barrier ranges and moved his family to Thackaringa, [[New South Wales]] and then to nearby Broken Hill, New South Wales, to live.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Broken Hill was to become Albert's permanent home.

Early in life, Albert developed a keen interest in plants. It is possible that a serious injury to his foot in his early childhood which prevented him from taking part in the bustle of childhood activity, contributed to his independence and self-containment, and to an increasing interest in [[botany]]. However, it is documented that his father, Joe Morris, was an "enthusiastic" botanist and young Albert was his "offsider", so this  was a more likely source of his botanical interests, as well as innate talent and an interest in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;"Comments of readers: Appreciation of Late Mr A Morris" in "Barrier Miner" 14/01/39&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he was undertaking technical school studies in [[metallurgy]] and [[assay]]ing, Morris had developed a small garden and nursery, and contributed to the cost of his fees by selling plants (pepper trees) that he had grown. Morris took up work with the Central Mine at Broken Hill, eventually becoming chief assayer for this mining company.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris was married at Broken Hill on 13 April 1909 to Ellen Margaret Sayce (1887-1957), known as Margaret Morris, a dressmaker who had studied art in Adelaide. Margaret also developed skilled amateur interests in botany, conservation and journalism.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris 1939&lt;/ref&gt; She was a member of the [[Society of Friends]], (Quakers). Albert's formative years were spent as an Anglican and "some years" after his marriage he converted to Quakerism.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. 1966&lt;/ref&gt; They built a cottage in Cornish Street, Railway Town (a suburb of Broken Hill). This was an area of Broken Hill that was extremely exposed to the fierce westerly winds of the region and the resultant soil erosion and drifting sand; trees had been cut for fuel and years of overstocking and the rabbit plague had denuded the land. Broken Hill was severely affected by drifting sand and dust, which in summer became major dust storms making work and domestic life difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Broken Hill work of Albert Morris==
=== Amenity and ecological restoration ===

From time immemorial the traditional owners of the lands around Broken Hill were the [[Wilyakali]] people. Over some sixty years of European dispossession, colonisation and settlement (c.1870-c.1930), the once well-vegetated, indigenous fauna rich and soil stable landscape of the Barrier Ranges had progressively been devastated by pastoral overstocking, exotic animals such as rabbits, foxes and [[feral]] goats, mining and its residues, and by the impacts of a large urban settlement of people and their stock. Natural recovery from these detrimental impacts was inhibited by the semi-arid climate which consisted of low average rainfall of 250mm pr annum and high summer temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Beadle 1948; Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

As early as 1908, newspaper comments indicated that the [[sheet erosion]] around Broken Hill had already begun. Morris described the degraded landscape in these terms: 
''"The extending country stretched for miles without a vestige of any green thing and each stone or old tin had a streamer of sand tailing out from it. The fences were piled high with sand, inside and out and it looked as if the intended railway lines would just be buried every dusty day, which was every windy day"''.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, A. 1938&lt;/ref&gt; 

Albert was concerned about the detrimental impact that the local erosion and sand storms had on the amenity of his fellow citizens of Broken Hill, as houses and gardens were immersed in sand. He lamented the loss of indigenous fauna species due to the destruction of their natural habitats, and the breakdown of local ecosystems and their beauty. He looked for ways to manage these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, A. 1938; Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Several failures at establishing a barrier to the wind blown sand deposits in his garden inspired Morris to search for plants that could be grown in the prevailing tough arid conditions and control erosion by binding the bare soil.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. 1966&lt;/ref&gt; He began to acquire expertise with botanical taxonomy and systematics and by the mid 1920s was corresponding with other Australian botanists. &lt;ref&gt;Morris 1966; Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.. He established a home nursery, purchasing adjoining land so he could expand it and his garden. He made [[field trips]] into the country around Broken Hill, studying and collecting specimens of the indigenous [[flora]] and observing the local [[ecosystems]]. 
 
===Barrier Field Naturalists Club===


In 1920 with Margaret Morris and [http://oa.anu.edu.au/obituary/macgillivray-william-david-15571 W.D.K. McGillivray] (1868-1933), a local doctor and also a prominent Australian ornithologist and natural scientist, Albert helped establish the Broken Hill-based Barrier Field Naturalists Club and acted as its secretary until his death in 1939. &lt;ref&gt;Morris M. 1966; Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The Club focused on the study of the natural sciences and was particularly active in the fields of botany, history and geology, conducting regular field trips and lecture series. Albert and Margaret participated prominently in the club's activities. As well as Margaret's diverse contributions, it is important to note that throughout the 1920s and 1930s Albert's botanical, conservation, tree plantation and regeneration work was strongly stimulated and  supported by the many talented members of the Field Naturalists Club, people such as Dr. William MacGillivray, his son Dr. Ian MacGillivray, Edmund Dow, Maurice Mawby and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Morris became widely recognised for his botanical expertise, tree plantation work and his propagation and contributions of plants to residents and civic bodies in Broken Hill, and for his firm belief in the possibility of re-establishing vegetation around the city.

===Botany, ecology, conservation, restoration===

 
While he trained and worked as an assayer at the Central Mine, it was as a botanist, ecologist and conservationist that Albert is best remembered and celebrated. His enduring legacy at Broken Hill is the 'green belt' of re-vegetation and regeneration around the city, now known as the "Broken Hill regeneration area", that he conceived and worked to establish. 

Morris achieved national and international recognition as an expert on arid zone Australian flora, and corresponded with many prominent Australian botanists. &lt;ref&gt;Jones 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He made a collection of about 8000 plant specimens, which was donated to the [[Waite Institute]] in South Australia in 1944. This collection is now predominantly held by the [[State Herbarium of South Australia]] with some specimens held by other state collections including the Royal Botanic Garden of NSW. &lt;ref&gt;CHAH 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He was noted for his generosity and hospitality to fellow naturalists and others working at Broken Hill. Among those he helped was the noted botanist and author [[Thistle Harris]], who worked in Broken Hill as a teacher c.1930. &lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1936 Albert Morris had acquired considerable expertise in the distinct fields of arid zone tree plantation establishment and arid zone natural regeneration. This expertise was based on the field knowledge that he had acquired on Barrier Field Naturalists Club outings into the surrounding countryside from 1920 onwards, his deep botanical knowledge of arid zone flora species and experience gained from the establishment of small tree plantations, containing flora species suited to the arid conditions,  in the city of Broken Hill (c.1930), particularly around the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; His own home nursery experiments with sand stabilising plants such as saltbush further enhanced his restoration knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. 1966; Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Broad acreage field trials conducted in 1935-36 on local pastoral stations that involved fencing to exclude stock and rabbits in order to facilitate natural regeneration of the indigenous flora convinced him of the efficacy of the natural regeneration method of degraded land restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert was also possessed of extensive administrative and communication skills. His professional employment as an assayer involved responsible administrative duties, and he utilised this experience to good effect in his volunteer conservation work. As secretary of the Barrier Field Naturalists Club he corresponded with and lobbied New South Wales state government ministers and other representatives of industry and government bodies on conservation and restoration matters. 

In particular, in 1935, he wrote on behalf of the Barrier Field Naturalists to the New South Wales state government, urging the government to establish a fenced natural regeneration area around Broken Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1936, on behalf of the Barrier Field Naturalists Club, Albert and other members presented detailed submissions on soil and flora conservation and restoration techniques to the New South Wales Erosion Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1936 Albert and the Club commenced lobbying the state government to fence two water reservoir sites in Broken Hill, in order to exclude stock and rabbits and allow the indigenous flora there to naturally regenerate. Due to Albert's persistence this work was approved in September, 1937, and the fencing was done in April, 1939, shortly after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tree plantations and regeneration reserves===
 

In 1936 the Zinc Corporation, another Broken Hill mining company, had developed extensive plans to construct a new mine complex on a bare, desert like piece of ground to the south-west of Broken Hill, and engaged the honorary services of Albert Morris to advise them on the establishment of tree plantations to protect the new mine works from sand-drift and the strong local westerly winds. Construction of these tree plantations, which were to be irrigated with waste water and established by traditional planting methods but using native Australian vegetation including saltbush, a method Morris had experimented with, commenced in May, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

As anticipated by the knowledgeable Morris, the initial fencing of the proposed tree plantation areas facilitated rapid and substantial natural regeneration within the still unplanted and otherwise bare, fenced enclosures, of native grasses and [[forbs]] germinating from seed stored in the soil. &lt;ref&gt;Morris, A. 1938&lt;/ref&gt;.. Crucially, this regrowth of native vegetation persisted as a result of foraging livestock and rabbits having been excluded by the new fencing. Morris seized on this significant (approx. 22 acres) demonstration of natural regeneration principles and convinced the Zinc Corporation mine manager, A.J. Keast, to obtain the backing of senior Zinc Corp management and other mining companies in Broken Hill to undertake a new project, the trial fencing of regeneration reserves to the south-west of the city, reserves which would utilise ''natural regeneration'', and not ''planting'', as their primary method of re-vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, A. 1938; Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that Morris had fully anticipated and predicted this natural regeneration within the tree plantation fenced areas; as mentioned he had already observed and confirmed this process in previous broad acreage field trials and was aware of the ways in which indigenous flora seed could be naturally stored in the soil, be dispersed by wind and germinate and thrive after relatively small amounts of rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; For the times, this was pioneering knowledge, and largely originated from Albert's detailed botanical studies of the local flora.

===The Broken Hill regeneration area: 1936-58===


Work on the tree plantations, which were located close to the Zinc Corporation mining, office and residential complex, continued, but Morris was now also managing, again in an honorary capacity, the new project, the construction of fenced regeneration reserves along the south-west perimeter of Broken Hill. This work, which ultimately comprised the first stage of the current Broken Hill regeneration area, commenced in the spring of 1936 and was completed in February, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Further reserves were added between 1937 and 1939, so that the entire south and westward aspects of Broken Hill were protected from wind driven sand-drifts by naturally regenerated indigenous vegetation of the type that naturally occurred on the site.

Sadly, Albert Morris died in January, 1939, after several months of illness, but he did live to see substantial evidence of the success of his regeneration work. Indeed, the successful vegetation regeneration within the initial set of regeneration reserves was highly praised by the visiting South Australian Erosion Committee (June 1937) and by mid-1937 the Zinc Corporation, impressed with the vegetation regrowth within the first set of regeneration reserves, was planning the construction of new reserves to the north-west of the city, and this work was completed by early 1938. Albert was also aware that a Broken Hill community progress association had successfully obtained funds from the state government to finance the construction of a regeneration reserve to the south of the city in 1938-39.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, Albert did not live to see the beneficial effect that the good rains of 1939 had on the reserves.   

The Second World War (1939-45) delayed the further development of more regeneration reserves. Margaret Morris was active in the botanical management and documentation of the reserves during this period and also successfully promoted them with newspaper articles and an article in the Australian Journal of Science.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017; Morris, M. 1939&lt;/ref&gt; In her articles Margaret was unstinting in her generous acknowledgement of the contributions made by members of the Broken Hill community, the mining industry and Broken Hill Council. The Barrier Field Naturalists Club also continued its involvement with the reserves, with members conducting botanical surveys of the thriving natural flora. The Mine Managers Association of Broken Hill contributed generously to finance the upkeep of the regeneration reserves and Broken Hill Council managed this work.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt;     

The citizens of Broken Hill suffered severely from the effects of the drought of 1940 and further prolonged dry periods in the early to mid-1940s, with enormous dust storms ravaging the city. With the completion of the Second World War and due to the success and popularity of the regeneration reserves, the city administration lobbied the New South Wales government to complete the encirclement of the city with further regeneration reserves, and these were constructed to the north and east of Broken Hill between 1950 and 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The regeneration reserves of 1936-58 now primarily comprise the current Broken Hill regeneration area, with minor adjustments having being made over the years.

===Re-vegetation techniques used===


It has in the past and still is very often mistakenly assumed that a ''planting'' technique was utilised to initially establish all of the regeneration reserves. It is correct that the Zinc Corporation tree plantations of 1936-37, separate and relatively small projects located immediately adjacent to the urban area and piped water resources, were irrigated and their vegetation was primarily established by the manual planting of thousands of trees, with saltbush also being planted. However it is clear from the documentation of the time that the regeneration reserves, as distinct from the tree plantations, utilised principles of natural regeneration, and not planting, to initiate re-vegetation, and also principles of what is today known as the contemporary restoration concept [[ecological restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, A. 1938; Ardill 2017; McDonald 2017a; McDonald 2017b&lt;/ref&gt; See also: http://seraustralasia.com and [[bush regeneration]]. 

Albert was interested in achieving broad acreage arid zone re-vegetation, both for amenity and conservation purposes, and it would have been impossible to achieve this, given the prevailing dry, hot and often drought stricken environment, by utilising a ''planting'' technique. To propagate, manually plant and keep hydrated until they were established the tens of thousands of trees, shrubs, grasses and forbs, spread over many hundreds of rugged hectares, necessary for such a project would have required enormous resources and funding; it is unlikely that such a project would even be feasible today. It was clearly his intention that the establishment of vegetation in the regeneration reserves was to be primarily left to the factors associated with natural regeneration: [[germination]] of existing, naturally deposited and wind dispersed seeds of the local flora and the regrowth of established but degraded in ground rootstocks, and the local rainfall of approximately 250mm per year.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, A. 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially, fencing around the reserves excluded the livestock and rabbits that had previously decimated this indigenous flora. Spreading of seed by hand and the ploughing of moisture impermeable claypans (aka scalds) were techniques also contemplated by Morris.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, A. 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Relatively little or no tree or shrub planting was done in order to establish the regeneration reserves, except in an undefined section of regeneration reserve no. 2, which was also irrigated as this reserve was adjacent to the small and irrigated tree plantation no. 1, now known as Albert Morris Park.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Some planting was carried out by community members along water courses and in claypans and extensive tree planting was carried out along some road verges from approximately 1939 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remembrance and celebration==

The regeneration area still encircles Broken Hill today, providing the city with an attractive ring of natural vegetation. It is managed by Broken Hill City Council with the support of [[Landcare in Australia|Landcare]] Broken Hill and members of the Barrier Field Naturalists Club. The regeneration reserves were recognised as cultural heritage items by the New South Wales National Trust in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the City of Broken Hill was declared a place of national heritage values by the Australian government. As part of this recognition, Albert's achievements and the Broken Hill regeneration reserves were listed as heritage values of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  

The work of Albert Morris was valued and commemorated by the citizens of Broken Hill. In 1941 a water fountain dedicated to his memory and funded by public subscription, was installed outside the Technical College, Argent Street, Broken Hill. In 1944 Margaret Morris opened the Albert Morris Memorial Gates, which are now located in Wentworth Road, Broken Hill. The John Scougall Gates, named after Jack Scougall, a foreman of works on the regeneration reserves and later manager of the Zinc Corporation nursery, stand nearby.   

A consortium of Australian ecological restoration organisations initiated the Albert Morris Award for an Outstanding Ecological Restoration Project in 2017 to mark the eighty year anniversary of the completion of the first regeneration reserves in 1937. In August, 2017, the Australian Association of Bush Regenerators, Broken Hill City Council, The Barrier Field Naturalists Club, Landcare Broken Hill and Broken Hill Art Exchange came together with many visitors and local residents in Broken Hill to mark this event with a field trip and inaugural Albert Morris Ecological Restoration Award dinner.  The Award dinner recognised the skills, dedication and community spirit of Albert Morris, Margaret Morris and their many colleagues in the Barrier Field Naturalists Club, the contributions of Broken Hill citizens and community members, and the contributions of the mining industry of Broken Hill, Broken Hill City Council and the New South Wales state government, to the regeneration area project.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, M. 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; At the Award dinner the inaugural Albert Morris Award for an Outstanding Ecological Restoration Project was presented "to the Broken Hill Regeneration Reserves Project itself and all those who made it happen from 1936-1958 and those who are still making it happen". &lt;ref&gt;Ardill &amp; Brodie 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The actual award is a sculpture by Badger Bates, a distinguished Broken Hill artist and member of the Paakantji People of the Darling River, western NSW. The sculpture is titled 'Regeneration’ and is made from the wattle "Dead Finish", ''Acacia tetragonophylla''. &lt;ref&gt;AABR News October 2017; Ardill &amp; Brodie 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
== The South Australian work of Albert Morris ==

In 1932 [[Essington Lewis]], famed manager of the Australian industrial and mining corporation, Broken Hill Proprietary Company ([[BHP]]), invited Albert Morris to visit South Australia and investigate the possibility of establishing tree plantations at the companies' corporate towns of [[Whyalla]] and [[Iron Knob]], for amenity purposes. During a series of visits between 1932 and 1937 Morris (the historical documentation does not record participation by Margaret Morris in the S.A. projects) successfully established an Australian flora plant nursery in Whyalla and developed plantations of Australian flora there and at Iron Knob. He also advised the municipal council of [[Port Pirie]] on the possibility of establishing plantations there, although no actual work appears to have been undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  

Morris initiated two natural regeneration projects in Whyalla, most likely between 1935 and 1937. At Hummock Hill, fencing of the bare site to exclude dairy cattle led to the regeneration of the indigenous flora. The second project was located on the current site of the Ada Ryan Gardens in Whyalla, and involved the management of invasive beach sand dunes by fencing to exclude rabbits and cattle, allowing the indigenous flora to recover. By 1939 both projects were being hailed as major successes with tangible outcomes. &lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Book censorship''' is when some authority, government or otherwise, takes measures to prevent access to a book or to part of its contents. It can be enacted at the national or subnational level, and can carry legal penalties. Books may also be [[Challenge (literature)|challenged]] at a local community level, although successful bans do not extend outside that area. Similarly, religions may issue lists of banned books—a historical example being the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''—which do not always carry legal force.

==Background==
"Almost every country places some restrictions on what may be published, although the emphasis and the degree of control differ from country to country and at different periods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/censorship-of-books/1|title=CENSORSHIP OF BOOKS|work=teara.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of reasons for which books may be banned. Materials are often suppressed due to the perceived notion of obscenity. This obscenity can apply to materials that are about sexuality, race, drugs, or social standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/bbooks/about|title=About Banned &amp; Challenged Books|work=ala.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The censorship of literature on the charge of obscenity appears to have begun in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="universityofsouthflorida"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=rfh&amp;AN=ATLA0000696290&amp;site=eds-live|title=USF NetID Single-SignOn - University of South Florida|author=University of South Florida|work=usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the middle class, who had evangelical backgrounds, brought about this concern with obscenity.&lt;ref name="universityofsouthflorida"/&gt;

Governments have also sought to ban certain books which they perceive to contain material that could threaten, embarrass, or criticize them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/banned-books.html|title=Banned Books Online|work=upenn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other leaders outside the government have banned books, including religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
 | title = Index Librorum Prohibitorum
 | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church leaders who prohibit members of their faith from reading the banned books may want to shelter them from perceived obscene, immoral, or profane ideas or situations or from ideas that may challenge the teaching of that religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=54091811&amp;site=eds-live|title=USF NetID Single-SignOn - University of South Florida|author=University of South Florida|work=usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But even religious materials have been subject to censorship. For example, various [[religious text|scriptures]] have been banned (and sometimes burned at several points in history). The [[Bible]], and other religious scriptures have all been subjected to censorship and have been banned by various governments. Similarly, books based on the scriptures have also been banned, such as [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'', which was banned in the [[Russian Empire]] for being [[anti-establishment]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sitemaker.umich.edu/globalnonviolence/files/tolstoy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Banning of a book often has the effect of making people [[Streisand effect|seek the book]].&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/09/20/224427254/could-banning-books-actually-encourage-more-readers|title=Could Banning Books Actually Encourage More Readers?|date=20 September 2013|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of banning the book creates an interest in the book which has the opposite effect of making the work more popular.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

==Book burning==
[[Book burning]] is the practice of destroying, often ceremonially, books or other written material. It is usually carried out in public, and is generally motivated by moral, religious, or political objections to the material, with a desire to censor it.

A '''cement bond log''' documents the evaluation of the integrity of [[cement]] work performed on an [[oil well]].&lt;ref name="OilfieldGlossary1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=cement%20bond%20log|title=cement bond log|accessdate=2008-12-18|publisher=Schlumberger Limited|work=Oilfield Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of drilling and completing a well, cement is injected through the [[wellbore]] and rises up the [[Annulus (well)|annulus]] between the steel [[Casing (borehole)|casing]] and the [[Geological formation|formation]].&lt;ref name="OilfieldGlossary2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=casing|title=casing|accessdate=2008-12-18|publisher=Schlumberger Limited|work=Oilfield Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sonic tool is typically run on [[wireline (cabling)|wireline]] by a service company that detects the bond of the cement to the casing and formation via a principle based on [[resonance]]. Casing that is not bound has a higher resonant vibration than that which is bound, causing the imparted energy from the sonic signal to be transferred to the formation.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} In this sense, the [[amplitude]] of the [[waveform]] received is the basic measurement that is evaluated.

The data is collected by the tool and recorded on a log which is used by the oil producing company as an indicator of [[zonal isolation]] in the well. There are production reasons and legal reasons (governed by a petroleum regulatory body in each individual state) that dictate the well must have specific areas of isolation.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4518">The '''Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas''' (lit. "Center for Research in Mathematics"), commonly known by its acronym in [[Spanish language]] as '''CIMAT''', is a [[North America]]n scientific research institution based on the city of [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]], in the homonym State of [[Guanajuato]], in central [[Mexico]], and was established in the year 1980. It belongs to the Mexican National System of Public Centers of Research under administration of the country's [[CONACyT|National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT)]].

CIMAT is oriented to scientific research under the auspices of the Mexican government. It is also devoted to the generation, dissemination and application of knowledge in specialized fields, as well as to the formation of human resources in the areas of Pure and Applied [[mathematics]], [[Probability]] and [[Statistics]], and [[Computer Science]]. Of CIMAT's faculty, more than 80% of the researchers belong to the Mexican National System of Researchers ([[Sistema Nacional de Investigadores|SNI]]), and 93% hold a Ph.D. Degree. Academically, the center is organized in four main areas: [[Pure Mathematics]],  [[Applied Mathematics]], Probability and Statistics, and Computer Science.

The research groups of the center interact strongly with similar institutions in Mexico and in foreign countries. This provides a continuous flow of visitors from around the world and provides conferences, workshops, and seminars.

The educational programs at CIMAT currently have more than 200 students, who come from all over the country and from abroad (mainly from [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]n countries, but also from [[Africa|African countries]], the rest of North America, [[Spain]] and other countries). The Master's and Doctorate programs offered at the center are registered in the Excellency Graduate Studies Registry of the National Council of Science and Technology, CONACyT.

CIMAT's infrastructure includes offices, an auditorium, many seminar rooms, a specialized mathematical library, computing equipment, electronic communication devices, and a lodge known as CIMATEL, for the arrangement of national and international conferences, courses and academic reunions.

==Education==

The center offers undergraduate and graduate programs that are attended by students from all over the country and abroad. The undergraduate programs are offered jointly with the [[University of Guanajuato]], yet the teaching is in charge of the center's faculty. Many of the undergraduate students are former international/Iberoamerican [[mathematical Olympiad]] or informatics Olympiad contestants and medal winners.

CIMAT has an important role in the teaching of the mathematics and computer science undergraduate programs of the mathematics department of the [[University of Guanajuato]].

Also, CIMAT offers a thesis-writing program, for students affiliated to other universities in the country.

Courses are usually offered in Spanish only.

==Departments==

The center has three departments:
*'''Pure and Applied mathematics.''' Research groups are devoted to [[differential geometry]], [[algebraic geometry]], [[applied mathematics]], [[dynamical systems]], [[functional analysis]], [[topology]] and [[combinatorial geometry]]. 
*'''Probability and Statistics.''' Research groups are interested in probability and [[stochastic processes]], environmental statistics, and industrial statistics.
*'''Computer science.''' Research lines include: [[image processing]] and [[computer vision]], [[robotics]],  [[numerical methods]], [[ optimization]], [[pattern recognition]] and [[data transmission]]. 
*'''Unidad Aguascalientes.''' It is located in the city of Aguascalientes (near Guanajuato, approximately 2.5 hours away). Its purpose is to serve as a link with the Industrial Sector of Aguascalientes.
*'''[http://www.ingsoft.mx Unidad Zacatecas].''' It is located in the city of Zacatecas (near Aguascalientes, approximately 50 minutes away). It is a research group in Software Engineering and its applications

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7548">'''Cognitive semiotics''' is the study model of [[meaning-making]], applying methods and theories from [[semiotics]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]], [[computational modeling]], [[anthropology]], [[philosophy]] and other sciences.  Contrary to classical cognitive science, cognitive semiotics is explicitly involved with questions of meaning, having recourse, when possible, to semiotic terminology, although developing it when necessary. As against classical semiotics, cognitive semiotics aims to incorporate the results of other sciences, using methods ranging from conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental and ethnographic investigations.

==History==
Cognitive semiotics has many sources. The first person to suggest the integration of the cognitive sciences and semiotics seems to have been Thomas C. Daddesio (1994). The Argentinean researcher Juan Magariños de Morentin has long been using the term "cognitive semiotics" to describe his own Peircean approach to semiotics (missing direct reference dating first time using "cognitive semiotics"). This is also the name of a web forum which he directed for many years. Several other prominent semioticians have been known to subscribe to a cognitive approach, such as [[Irene Mittelberg]] in gesture studies and [[Jean-Marie Klinkenberg]] in pictorial semiotics. 

[[Per Aage Brandt]] founded a Center for Semiotics in 1995 at [[Aarhus University]] and subsequently a Master Education in Cognitive Semiotics, to investigate the connections between semiotics and cognitive science (with a strong focus on cognitive linguistics), and he has had several followers along this line such as [[Line Brandt]] (Center for Semiotics at Aarhus University), and [[Todd Oakley]] (Case Western Reserve University). The Center for Semiotics is currently constituted by [[Frederik Stjernfelt]], [[Peer Bundgaard]], [[Mikkel Wallentin]], [[Svend Østergaard]], [[Riccardo Fusaroli]] and [[Kristian Tylén]]. Bundgaard published an anthology in Danish which brings together texts from cognitive science, cognitive linguistics, and semiotics. Stjernfelt has combined the inspiration from Peirce with that from Husserl. Wallentin is conducting neuro-imaging investigations. Tylén and Fusaroli develop behavioral and neuroscientific experimental approaches to sign usage and linguistic conversations.

Since 2009, there is also a Centre for Cognitive Semiotics (CCS) at Lund University (Sweden), which is headed by Göran Sonesson, who has long been working in the direction of cognitive semiotics, integrating semiotic theory with experimental studies, mainly with application to the study of pictures. Sonesson started collaborating with the linguist [[Jordan Zlatev]] around 2001 and organized a number of research project together with him, before adopting the label "cognitive semiotics". Other members of the CCS are, notably,  [[Mats Andrén]], who has published a number of gesture studies, partially in collaboration with Zlatev, and Sara Lenninger, who is working with Sonesson on the semiotics of pictures. The particular direction taken by cognitive semiotics in Lund consists in experimental studies which are geared to elucidate fundamental semiotic concepts such as sign, index, icon, etc., as well as their precursor notion such as imitation, mimesis, empathy and intersubjectivity. The research at CCS centers on the phylogeny and ontogeny of human semiosis, employing apes and children, respectively, as research subjects.

==Journal of Cognitive Semiotics==

An international journal on cognitive semiotics, (Journal of) Cognitive Semiotics (JCS) – Multidisciplinary Journal on Meaning and Mind, was started  in Denmark in 2005. Its inaugural issue, edited by Lars Andreassen, Line Brandt and Jes Vang, was published in 2007 (spring). In the fall of 2007, the first peer-reviewed issue, a theme issue on ‘Consciousness &amp; Semiosis’ (eds. Per Aage Brandt and Jakob Simonsen), was published, with funding from Case Western Reserve University. The editorial board consisted of Line Brandt, Per Aage Brandt, Frank Kjørup, Todd Oakley, Jacob Orquin, Jakob Simonsen and Jes Vang. Since then, many issues have been published, in part by Peter Lang, and in part online, available from the journal web site. From 2014, the journal has been published by Mouton de Gruyter. The present board consists of Peer Bundgaard, Göran Sonesson, Todd Oakley, Merlin Donald, and Bruno Gantolucci.

The journal's website states:  "The first of its kind, Cognitive Semiotics is a multidisciplinary journal devoted to high quality research, integrating methods and theories developed in the disciplines of cognitive science with methods and theories developed in semiotics and the humanities, with the ultimate aim of providing new insights into the realm of human signification and its manifestation in cultural practices." 

==International Association for Cognitive Semiotics==

The International Association for Cognitive Semiotics (IACS) was initiated during the conference of the Nordic Association for Semiotics Studies (NASS) in Lund in 2011, and officially founded during the conference of NASS in Aarhus in May 2013. The Journal of Cognitive Semiotics then became the official organ of the IACS. The first official conference of IACS took place in Lund in 2014, and the second conference was organized in Lublin in 2014. Selected papers from the Lund conference were published at Peter Lang at the end of 2016 (https://www.peterlang.com/view/product/22221), and the acts of the Lublin conference will appear as a thematic issue of the journal "Philosophy and Science”, published by the Polish Academy of Sciences. 

== Cognitive Semiotics of Film ==
''Cognitive Semiotics of Film'' is a [[monograph]] written by Warren S. Buckland. Within the monograph, Warren Buckland argues that the conflict between cognitive film theory and contemporary film theory is unproductive. Cognitive semiotics of film is a neglected branch of film theory that works together with the terms [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]]. Cognitive science is also incorporated in a combination with [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]] to form what is called cognitive semiotics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2459">{{About|an ecological term||Common (disambiguation)}}

'''Common species''' and '''uncommon species''' are designations used in [[ecology]] to describe the population status of a species.  Commonness is closely related to [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]].  Abundance refers to the frequency with which a species is found in controlled samples; in contrast, species are defined as common or uncommon based on their overall presence in the environment.  A species may be locally abundant without being common.

However, "common" and "uncommon" are also sometimes used to describe levels of abundance, with a common species being less abundant than an abundant species, while an uncommon species is more abundant than a rare species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/birds/stcroix/methods.htm|work=Birds of the St. Croix River Valley: Minnesota and Wisconsin|title=Methods, Terminology, and Nomenclature|author=Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center|accessdate=2006-12-31|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222235623/http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/birds/stcroix/methods.htm|archivedate=2006-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common species are frequently regarded as being at low risk of extinction simply because they exist in large numbers, and hence their conservation status is often overlooked. While this is broadly logical, there are several cases of once common species being driven to extinction such as the [[passenger pigeon]] and the [[Rocky Mountain locust]], which numbered in the billions and trillions respectively before their demise. Moreover, a small proportional decline in a common species results in the loss of a large number of individuals, and the contribution to ecosystem function that those individuals represented. A recent paper argued that because common species shape ecosystems, contribute disproportionately to ecosystem functioning, and can show rapid population declines, conservation should look more closely at how the trade-off between species extinctions and the depletion of populations.&lt;ref name=gaston&gt;Gaston, K.J. &amp; Fuller, R.A. 2008. Commonness, population depletion and conservation biology. Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 23, 14-19. {{doi|10.1016/j.tree.2007.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conjunct consonants''' are a type of letters, used for example in [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]] or modern [[Devanagari]], to write [[consonant cluster]]s such as {{IPA|/pr/}} or {{IPA|/rv/}}. Although most of the time, letters are formed by using a simple consonant with the inherent value vowel "a" (as with "k" [[File:Brahmi k.svg|12px]], pronounced "ka" in Brahmi), or by combining a consonant with an vowel in the form of an [[diacritic]] (as with "ki" [[File:Brahmi letter Ki.svg|12px]] in Brahmi), the usage of conjunct consonant permits the creation of more sophisticated sounds (as with "kya" [[File:Brahmi Kya.jpg|12px]], formed with the consonants k [[File:Brahmi k.svg|10px]] and y [[File:Brahmi y.svg|10px]] assembled verticaly).&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Conjuncts are often used with loan words. Native words typically use the basic consonant and native speakers know to suppress the vowel.

In modern Devanagari the components of a conjunct are written left to right when possible (when the first consonant has a vertical stem that can be removed at the right), whereas in Brahmi characters are joined vertically downwards.&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shapiro |first1=Michael C. |title=A Primer of Modern Standard Hindi |date=1989 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=9788120805088 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vvuP8sD1wloC&amp;pg=PA23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some simple examples of conjunct consonants in Devanagari are: त + व = त्व tva, ण + ढ = ण्ढ ṇḍha, स + थ = स्थ stha, where the vertical stroke of the first letter is simply lost in the combination. Sometimes, conjunct consonants are not clearly derived from the letters making up their components: the conjunct for kṣ is क्ष (क् + ष) and for jñ it is ज्ञ (ज् + ञ). 

Conjunct consonants are used in many other scripts as well, usually derived from the Brahmi script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tuṅga |first1=Sudhāṃśu Śekhara |title=Bengali and Other Related Dialects of South Assam |date=1995 |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=9788170995883 |page=163 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRRYBHQvXdsC&amp;pg=PA163 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Balinese script|Balinese]], conjunct consonants are called ''Haksara Wrehastra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shadeg |first1=Norbert |title=Tuttle Balinese-English Dictionary |date=2014 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |isbn=9781462910786 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20ktBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6428">The '''County Herb Committees''' were a nationwide medicinal plant collecting scheme, established by the British [[Ministry of Health]] during World War II. 
They were set up at a time when the German occupation of France and the disruption of shipping lanes interfered with drug supplies. As in WWI, the British found that the Germans still largely dominated the pharmaceutical industry and consequently by the early 1940s there were critical shortages of essential medicines in hospitals and homes across Britain.

First the Vegetable Drugs Committee or VDC was established at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], including two Kew experts, Dr Metcalfe and Dr Ronald Melville, botanist and pharmacist. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Britain's Green Allies: Medicinal Plants in Wartime|last1=Ayres|first1=Peter|chapter=6 The Home Front|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NvZBCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=britain's+green+allies,+Supply+of+Vegetable+Drugs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7w9OHyurSAhXlL8AKHewFBXkQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=britain's%20green%20allies%2C%20Supply%20of%20Vegetable%20Drugs&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee found that a number of imported drugs were derived from plants that were also native to Britain. By 1941, they were publishing guides for herb collectors in the rural British communities. Various groups such as Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, Women's Institutes and the elderly, were enlisted as collectors by Sir Arthur Hill, Director of Kew.

In 1941, the wholesale pharmaceutical company Brome and Schimmer published a booklet called ''Herb Gardening'', describing the many roots, flowers and herbs needed by the Ministry of Health, and how to collect and dry them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Green and Pleasant Land: How England's Gardeners Fought the Second World War|chapter=Women and Children Go To It|last1=Buchan|first1=Ursula|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oWxGhBUPQB0C&amp;pg=PT265&amp;lpg=PT265&amp;dq=green+and+pleasant+land+vegetable+drugs+committee&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=85wUmsJ8FJ&amp;sig=SASWATbEWFd7sh4i2lhldbK8x-E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz_-n0yOrSAhUoCcAKHRUPDKAQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=green%20and%20pleasant%20land%20vegetable%20drugs%20committee&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Supply]] issued monthly bulletins for rural herb committees that provided information for collecting herbs in different areas. The first bulletin in 1942 described how in Derbyshire "The Hathersage Women's Institutes dried fifty pounds of materials chiefly nettles in the attic of a house, and the Clifton and Mayfield Boy Scouts dried seventy-six pounds of Foxglove at their headquarters. They hope to do much more this year and the county committee is looking around for drying depots." (The cardiac glycosides in Foxglove degrade if the plants are not dried carefully. A leaflet from Kew advised that collectors spread the plants on racks to dry in a coke-heated shed at 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=the Herbal Academy|title=Medicinal Plant Use in World War II|last1=Sumner|first1=Judith|url=https://theherbalacademy.com/medicinal-plant-use-in-world-war-ii}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A pamphlet that the Vegetable Drugs Committee published in 1941 stated that the most essential medicinal plants needed were belladonna, colchicum, digitalis, hyoscyamus, stramonium and valerian - and that he countries of origin for these plants had previously been Hungary, Italy, Germany and Yugoslavia. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Britain's Green Allies: Medicinal Plants in Wartime|last1=Ayres|first1=Peter|page=64|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NvZBCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=britain's+green+allies,+Supply+of+Vegetable+Drugs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7w9OHyurSAhXlL8AKHewFBXkQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=britain's%20green%20allies%2C%20Supply%20of%20Vegetable%20Drugs&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 70 Committees were set up across England, Scotland and Wales, and grants of a total of £1,191 were made available to set up drying centres that could deal directly with trading companies. By the end of the war, there were 250 drying centres across country. Horticulturist Elizabeth Hess was the Agricultural Organiser for the Women's Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Horwood|title=Gardening Women: Their Stories From 1600 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RKqMMceJjukC&amp;pg=PT297|date=6 May 2010|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-0-7481-1833-5|pages=297–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first drying centre in Oxfordshire was in the home of Dr WO James and his wife Gladys in the village of Islip, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The WI|title=Countrywomen in War Time |last1=Stamper|first1=Anne|page=10|url=https://www.thewi.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/11111/countrywomen-in-war-time-womens-institutes-1938-1945-.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''date rape drug''' is any drug that is an [[incapacitating agent]] which—when administered to another person—incapacitates the person and renders them vulnerable to a [[drug-facilitated sexual assault]] (DFSA), including [[rape]]. One of the most common types of DFSA are those in which a victim consumes a recreational drug such as [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] that was administered surreptitiously.&lt;ref name="Lyman 2006 70"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyman|first=Michael D.|title=Practical drug enforcement|year=2006|publisher=CRC|location=Boca Raton, Fla.|isbn=0849398088|page=70|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other most common form of DFSA involves the non-surreptitiously-administered consumption of alcohol.&lt;ref name=alcohol&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/85513.php Alcohol Is Most Common 'Date Rape' Drug]. Medicalnewstoday.com. Retrieved on June 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the victims in these cases are drinking voluntarily which then makes them unable to make informed decisions and/or give consent.

==Frequency==
There is currently no comprehensive data on how frequently DFSA occurs with the use of surreptitious drug administration. The lack of data is due to the low report rate of assaults, and because rape victims who do report are often either never tested for these drugs, are tested for the wrong ones, or the tests are administered after the drug has been metabolized and left their body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15622794|last=Canadian Public Health Association |date= December 2004 |title=Rising Incidence of Hospital-reported Drug-facilitated Sexual Assault in a Large Urban Community in Canada: Retrospective Population-based Study  |journal=Canadian Journal of Public Health |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=441 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1999 study of 1,179 urine specimens from victims of suspected DFSAs in 49 American states found six (0.5%) positive for Rohypnol, 97 (8%) positive for other benzodiazepines, 48 (4.1%) positive for GHB, 451 (38%) positive for alcohol and 468 (40%) negative for any of the drugs searched for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/jat/23.3.141| title = Prevalence of Drugs Used in Cases of Alleged Sexual Assault| journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology| volume = 23| issue = 3| pages = 141–6| year = 1999| last1 = Elsohly | first1 = M.

A similar study of 2,003 urine samples of victims of suspected DFSAs found less than 2% tested positive for Rohypnol or GHB.&lt;ref name="Miller 2002 168"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Richard Lawrence|title=Drugs of abuse: a reference guide to their history and use|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=0313318077|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The samples used in these studies could only be verified as having been submitted within a 72-hour time frame or a 48-hour time frame. 

A three-year study in the UK detected sedatives or disinhibiting drugs that victims said they had not voluntarily taken in the urine of two percent of suspected DFSA victims. In 65% of the 1014 cases included in this study, testing could not be conducted within a time frame that would allow detection of GHB.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg18925334.400 Alcohol, not drugs, poses biggest date rape risk – health – January 7, 2006].

==Documented date rape drugs==

The drug most commonly used to facilitate sexual assault is [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], consumed voluntarily. Practically any drug (administered openly or surreptitiously) that facilitates rape could be considered a date rape drug. Since the mid-1990s, the media and researchers have documented a new form of DFSA featuring date rape drugs such as [[rohypnol]] and [[ketamine]]. Other drugs used in DFSA include [[hypnotics]] such as [[zopiclone]], [[methaqualone]] and the widely available [[zolpidem]] (Ambien), [[sedatives]] such as [[neuroleptics]] (anti-psychotics), [[chloral hydrate]] and some [[Histamine h1 antagonists|histamine H1 antagonists]], common recreational drugs such as [[ethanol]], [[cocaine]], and less common [[anticholinergics]], [[barbiturates]], [[opioids]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colombiabeat.com/main/2011/05/13/scopolamine-colombias-date-rape-drug/|title=Scopolamine: Colombia’s Date Rape Drug|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; nasal spray ingredient [[oxymetazoline]],&lt;ref name="al. 232"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Christopher P.

=== Alcohol ===
{{see also|Alcohol and sex}}
Researchers agree that the most common form of DFSA is alcohol-related,&lt;ref name=alcohol /&gt; with the victim in most cases consuming the alcohol voluntarily. In most jurisdictions, alcohol is legal and readily available and is used in the majority of sexual assaults.&lt;ref name="al. 232"/&gt; Many perpetrators use alcohol because their victims often willingly drink it, and can be encouraged to drink enough to lose inhibitions or consciousness. Sex with an unconscious victim is considered rape in most jurisdictions and some assailants have committed "rapes of convenience" whereby they assaulted a victim after he or she had become unconscious from drinking too much.&lt;ref&gt;[http://survive.org.uk/date-rape.html Date Rape]. Survive.org.uk (2000-03-20). Retrieved on June 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol consumption is known to have effects on [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] and [[aggression]]. During social interactions alcohol consumption causes more biased appraisal of a partner’s sexual motives while impairing communication about and enhancing misperception of sexual intentions, effects exacerbated by peer influence about how to behave when drinking.&lt;ref name="Abbey 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Abbey|first=A|year=2002 |title=Alcohol-related sexual assault: A common problem among college students|pmid=12022717 |pmc=4484270|journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol|volume=63|issue=2|pages=118–128 |url=http://www.collegedrinkingprevention.gov/media/journal/118-abbey.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The effects of alcohol at the point of [[forced sex]] commonly include an impaired ability to rectify misperceptions, and a diminished ability to resist sexual advances and aggressive sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="Abbey 2002"/&gt;

''[[Toledo Blade|The Blade]]'' released a special report, "The Making of an Epidemic," criticizing a study conducted in the 1990s that concluded that 55% of rape victims had been intoxicated. According to ''The Blade'', the study specifically ignored an Ohio statute that excluded "...situations where a person plies his intended partner with drink or drugs in hopes that lowered inhibition might lead to a liaison." The author of the study later admitted that the wording of the survey had been ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Blade, special report. "The Making of an Epidemic", p. 5. October 10, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alcohol in campus rape====
{{main|Campus rape#Influence of alcohol}}

The increase of sexual assaults on college campuses has been attributed to the social expectations of students to participate in alcohol consumption; [[norm (social)|social norm]] dictate that students drink heavily and engage in casual sex.&lt;ref name="Nicholson 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nicholson|first=M.E.|year=1998 |title=Trends in alcohol-related campus violence: Implications for prevention |journal=Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education|volume=43|issue=3|pages=34–52|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/086cfc310466180bd40beb4488dd71d7/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various studies have concluded the following:
* On average, at least 50% of college sexual assault cases are associated with alcohol use.&lt;ref name="Abbey 2002"/&gt;
* On college campuses, 74% of the perpetrators and 55% of the victims had been drinking alcohol.&lt;ref name="Abbey 2002"/&gt;
* In 2002, more than 70,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 were victims of alcohol-related sexual assault in the U.S.&lt;ref name="ncadi.samhsa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncadi.samhsa.gov/govpubs/prevalert/v5/11.aspx |title=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services |publisher= |accessdate=2011-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116034450/http://ncadi.samhsa.gov/govpubs/prevalert/v5/11.aspx |archivedate=January 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2016}}

{{main|Z-drug}}

====Zolpidem====
[[Zolpidem]] (Ambien) is one of the most common date-rape drugs according to the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diamondbackonline.com/2.2795/students-encounter-dangerous-date-rape-drug-1.287280 |title=The Diamondback - Students encounter dangerous date-rape drug |publisher= |accessdate=9 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110052931/http://www.diamondbackonline.com/2.2795/students-encounter-dangerous-date-rape-drug-1.287280 |archivedate=10 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benzodiazepines ===
Benzodiazepines ([[tranquilizers]]), such as [[Valium]], [[Librium]], [[Xanax]], and [[Ativan]], are prescribed to treat [[anxiety]], [[panic attacks]], [[insomnia]], and several other conditions, and are also frequently used recreationally. Benzodiazepines are often used in DFSA, with the most notorious being [[flunitrazepam]] (chemical name) or [[Rohypnol]] (proprietary or brand name), also known as "roofies," "rope," and "roaches."&lt;ref name="Hazelwood&amp;Burgess"&gt;{{cite book|editor2-last=Burgess|editor2-first=Ann Wolbert|editor1-first=Robert R.|editor1-last=Hazelwood|title=Practical aspects of rape investigation: a multidisciplinary approach|year=2009|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=1420065041|page=446|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldberg|first=Raymond|title=Drugs across the spectrum|year=2006|publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]]|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0495013455|page=195|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The benzodiazepines [[midazolam]] and [[temazepam]] were the two most common benzodiazepines utilized for date rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Analysis of urine samples in cases of alleged sexual assault case history |author1=ElSohly, Mahmoud A. |author2=Lee, Luen F. |author3=Holzhauer, Lynn B. |author4=Salamone, Salvatore J. | journal = Benzodiazepines and GHB | year = 2001 | pages = 127–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benzodiazepines can be detected in urine through the use of drug tests administered by medical officials or sold at pharmacies and performed at home. Most tests will detect benzodiazepines for a maximum of 72 hours after it was taken. Most general benzodiazepine detection tests will not detect Rohypnol: the drug requires a test specifically designed for that purpose. One new process can detect a 2&amp;nbsp;mg dose of Rohypnol for up to 28 days post-ingestion.&lt;ref name="Pyrek 2006 173"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watch out for Date Rape Drugs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdch/DateRapeDrugs_2002MSP_rv2011_355106_7.pdf |title=Watch out for Date Rape Drugs |publisher=Michigan Department of Community Health |accessdate=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tests for Rohypnol include blood and hair tests. Because the most commonly used drug tests often yield false negatives for Rohypnol, experts recommend use of [[gas chromatography]]-[[mass spectrometry]] analysis.&lt;ref name="Lyman 2006 70"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 2002 168"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rape investigation handbook"/&gt;

====Rohypnol====
This drug is also known as Whitleys, Trip-and-Fall, Ruffies, Rophies, Rope, Roopies, Roofies, Roches, Roach-2, Roach,  Mind Erasers, Rib, Lunch Money, R-2, Poor Man’s Quaalude, Mexican Valium, LA Rochas, Forget Pill, and Circles. Rohypnols comes as a pill that dissolves in liquids. Some are small, round, and white. Newer pills are oval and green-gray in color. When slipped into a drink, a dye in these new pills makes clear liquids turn bright blue and dark drinks turn cloudy. But this color change might be hard to see in a dark drink, like cola or dark beer, or in a dark room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/date_rape_drugs/article.htm|title=Date Rape Drug: List and Side Effects|work=MedicineNet|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one 2002 survey of 53 women who used Rohypnol recreationally, 10% said they were physically or sexually assaulted while under its influence.&lt;ref name="Miller 2002 168" /&gt; If enough of the drug is taken, a person may experience a state of [[automatic behavior|automatism]] or dissociation. After the drug wears off, users may find themselves unable to remember what happened while under its influence ([[anterograde amnesia]]), and feeling woozy, hung-over, confused, dizzy, sluggish and uncoordinated, often with an upset stomach. They may also have some difficulty moving their limbs normally.&lt;ref name="Lyman 2006 70" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 2002 168" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rape investigation handbook"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John O. Savino |author2=Brent E. Turvey |title=Rape investigation handbook|year=2011|publisher=Academic Press|location=Waltham, MA|isbn=0123860296|pages=338–9|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rohypnol is believed to be commonly used in DFSA in the United States, the United Kingdom, and throughout Europe, Asia and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor2-last=Burgess|editor2-first=Ann Wolbert|editor1-first=Robert R.|editor1-last=Hazelwood|title=Practical aspects of rape investigation: a multidisciplinary approach|year=2009|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=1420065041|pages=339–446|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rohypnol's use in DFSA has been covered extensively in the news media, researchers disagree about how common such use actually is. Law enforcement manuals describe it as one of the drugs most commonly implicated in DFSA,&lt;ref name="Lyman 2006 70"/&gt; but according to research conducted by Michael Robertson from the [[San Diego]] [[Medical examiner|Medical Examiner]]'s office and Dr. Mahmoud El Sohly of El Sohly Laboratories, test results indicated that flunitrazepam was only used in around 1% of reported date rapes according to Robertson and 0.33% according to urine lab tests done by El Sohly, of the rape-kits that actually get tested in time. Despite having a long half-life (18–28 hours) an incorrect belief is that Rohypnol is undetectable 12 hours after administration which may result in victims failing to get a blood or urine test the following day.

=== GHB/GBL/1,4 BDO ===
[[Gamma-hydroxybutyrate]] (GHB) is a [[central nervous system]] [[depressant]]. It has no odor, tastes salty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Abadinsky| first=Howard| title=Drug use and abuse: a comprehensive introduction|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning| location=Australia| isbn=0495809918|page=169|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is undetectable by humans when mixed in a drink.

GHB is used recreationally to stimulate [[euphoria]], to increase sociability, to promote libido and lower inhibitions.&lt;ref name="Miller 2002 183"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Richard Lawrence|title=Drugs of abuse: a reference guide to their history and use|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=0313318077|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sold under names such as Rufies, Liquid E and Liquid X. It is usually taken orally, by the capful or teaspoon.&lt;ref name="Lyman 2006 72–75"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyman|first=Michael D.|title=Practical drug enforcement|year=2006|publisher=CRC|location=Boca Raton, Fla.|isbn=0849398088|pages=72–75|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1996 to 1999, 22 reports of GHB being used in DFSA were made to the United States [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]. A 26-month study of 1,179 urine samples from suspected DFSAs across the United States found 4% positive for GHB.&lt;ref name="Miller 2002 183"/&gt; The [[National Drug Intelligence Center]] (NDIC) says that in the United States GHB had surpassed Rohypnol as the substance most commonly used in DFSA, likely because GHB is much more easily available, cheaper and leaves the body more quickly.&lt;ref name="Miller 2002 183"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pyrek 2006 173–176"/&gt; GHB is only detectable in urine for six to twelve hours after ingestion.&lt;ref name="Pyrek 2006 173–176"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pyrek|first=Kelly|title=Forensic nursing|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=Boca Raton|isbn=084933540X|pages=173–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
There were three stories in the media about [[Rohypnol]] in 1993, 25 in 1994 and 854 in 1996. In early 1996 [[Newsweek]] magazine published "Roofies: The date-rape drug" which ended with the line "Don't take your eyes off your drink." That summer, researchers say all major American urban and regional newspapers covered date rape drugs, with headlines such as "Crackdown sought on date rape drug" ([[Los Angeles Times]]), "Drug zaps memory of rape victims" ([[San Francisco Chronicle]]) and "Slow [[DEA]] Action Gives Women No Relief from the Threat of New Date-Rape Drug" ([[Detroit News]]). Date rape drugs were also covered in media aimed at young women such as [[Seventeen (American magazine)|''Seventeen'']] and [[Sassy (magazine)|''Sassy'']] magazines. In 1997 and 1998, the date rape drug story received extensive coverage on [[CNN]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|''20/20'']] and [[Primetime Live]], the [[Oprah Winfrey Show]], and the fictitious TV shows [[Beverly Hills 90210]] and [[South Park]]. Women were instructed to never drink from punch bowls, never leave a drink unattended, try no new drinks, drink nothing with an unusual taste or appearance, take their own drinks to parties, and drink nothing opened by another person.

News media has been criticized for overstating the DFSA threat, for providing "how to" material for potential date rapists and for advocating "grossly excessive protective measures for women, particularly in coverage between 1996 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Philip|title=Synthetic panics: the symbolic politics of designer drugs|year=1999|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0814742440|pages=20 and 161–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goode 2009 217"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goode|first=Erich|title=Moral panics: the social construction of deviance|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester, U.K.|isbn=1405189347|page=217|edition=2nd|author2=Ben-Yehuda, Nachman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Law enforcement representatives and feminists have also been criticized for supporting the overstatements for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Christine Shearer-Cremean|title=Survivor rhetoric: negotiations and narrativity in abused women's language|year=2004|publisher=Univ. of Toronto Press|location=Toronto [u.a.]|isbn=0802089739|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig Webber states that this extensive coverage has created or amplified a [[moral panic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webber|first=Craig|title=Psychology &amp; crime|year=2009|publisher=Sage.|location=London|isbn=1412919428|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  rooted in societal anxieties about rape, hedonism and the increased [[Women's liberation|freedoms of women]] in modern culture. Goode et al say it has given a powerful added incentive for the suppression of [[club drugs|party drugs]],&lt;ref name="Goode 2009 217"/&gt; has inappropriately undermined the long-established argument that [[recreational drug use]] is purely a consensual and [[victimless crime]]. By shining a spotlight on premeditated criminal behavior, Philip Jenkins states that it has relieved the culture from having to explore and evaluate more nuanced forms of male sexual aggression towards people, such as those displayed in date rapes that were not facilitated by the surreptitious administration of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Philip|title=Synthetic panics: the symbolic politics of designer drugs|year=1999|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0814742440|pages=161–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For similar moral panics around social tensions manifesting via discussion of drugs and sex crime, researchers point to the opium scare of the late 19th century, in which "sinister Chinese" were said to use opium to coerce white women into [[sexual slavery]]. Similarly, in the Progressive Era, a persistent [[urban legend]] told of white middle-class women being surreptitiously drugged, abducted and sold into sexual slavery to Latin American brothels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Philip|title=Synthetic panics: the symbolic politics of designer drugs|year=1999|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0814742440|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubinsky|first=Karen|title=Improper advances: rape and heterosexual conflict in Ontario, 1880-1929|year=1993|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago u.a.|isbn=0226167534|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis doesn't contradict instances when date rape drugs are used or sexual trafficking occurs; its focus is on actual prevalence of certain crimes relative to media coverage of it.

==Scope==
As opposed to [[continuous optimization]], some or all of the [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] used in a discrete [[optimization (mathematics)|mathematical program]] are restricted to be [[discrete variable]]s&amp;mdash;that is, to assume only a [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] set of values, such as the integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A First Course in Combinatorial Optimization|volume=36|series=Cambridge Texts in Applied Mathematics|first=Jon|last=Lee|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780521010122|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3pL1B7WVYnAC&amp;pg=PA1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branches==

* [[combinatorial optimization]], which refers to problems on [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, [[matroid]]s and other discrete structures
* [[integer programming]] 
These branches are closely intertwined however since many combinatorial optimization problems can be modeled as integer programs (e.g. [[Shortest path#Linear programming formulation|shortest path]]) and conversely, integer programs can often be given a combinatorial interpretation.

Orchestras are one of the largest [[musical ensemble]]s, as they can contain as many as 100 musicians.

The latter two sources of income are required because ticket sales alone do not provide enough income for most groups.]]
'''Economics of the arts and literature'''  or '''cultural economics''' (used below for convenience) is a branch of economics that studies the economics of creation, distribution, and the consumption of [[work of art|works of art]], literature and similar creative and/or cultural products.   For a long time, the concept of the "arts" were confined to visual arts (e.g., painting) and performing arts (music, theatre, dance) in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. Usage has widened since the beginning of the 1980s with the study of [[cultural industry]] (cinema, television programs, book and periodical publishing and music publishing) and the economy of cultural institutions (museums, libraries, historic buildings).  The field is coded as [[JEL classification codes#Other special topics (economics) JEL: Z Subcategories|JEL: Z11]] in the ''[[Journal of Economic Literature]]'' [[JEL classification codes|classification system]] used for article searches.&lt;ref&gt;In the JEL system, '[[Cultural economics|Cultural Economics]]' is a [[JEL classification codes#Other special topics (economics) JEL: Z Subcategories|broader category]] than used in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[File:Alejandro Plaza.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Painter Alejandro Plaza at work on a canvas. Once this painting is complete, it will be a unique good, for which there is no exact substitute]]
Cultural economics is concerned with the arts in a broad sense. The goods considered have creative content, but that is not enough to qualify as a cultural good. Designer goods such as clothes and drapes are not considered usually to be works of art or culture. Cultural goods are those with a value determined by symbolic content rather than physical characteristics. (For further considerations, see also [[Cultural Institutions Studies]]). Economic thinking has been applied in ever more areas in the last decennia, including pollution, corruption and education.

Works of art and culture have a specific quality, which is their uniqueness. While other economic goods, such as [[crude oil]] or [[wheat]] are generic, interchangeable commodities (given a specific grade of the product), there is only one example of a famous painting such as the [[Mona Lisa]], and only one example of Rodin's well-known sculpture "[[The Thinker]]". While copies or reproductions can be made of these works of art, and while many inexpensive posters of the Mona Lisa and small factory-made replicas of "The Thinker" are sold, neither full-size copies nor inexpensive reproductions are viewed as substitutes for the real artworks, in the way that a consumer views a pound of Grade A sugar from Cuba as a fully equivalent substitute for a pound of Grade A sugar from United States or Dominican Republic.  As there is no equivalent item or substitute for these famous works of art, classical economist [[Adam Smith]] held it was impossible to value them. [[Alfred Marshall]] noted that the demand for a certain kind of cultural good can depend on its consumption: The more you have listened to a particular kind of music, the more you appreciate. In his economic framework, these goods do not have the usual decreasing [[marginal utility]].

Key academic works in cultural economics include those of [[William Baumol|Baumol]] and [[William G. Bowen|Bowen]] (Performing Arts, The Economic Dilemma, 1966), of [[Gary Becker]] on addictive goods, and of [[Alan Peacock]] (public choice). This summary has been divided into sections on the economic study of the performing arts, on the market of individual pieces of art, the art market in cultural industries, the economics of cultural heritage and the labour market in the art sector.

== Performing arts: Baumol and cultural economics ==
[[File:Lux Video Theatre rehearsal 1951.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This picture shows actors rehearsing for a play in 1951. Despite the numerous technological advances in between 1951 and the 2010s, in the 2010s, it would still require the same number of actors to perform this play. For this reason, scholars argue that some cultural industries are not getting more efficient the way other industries, such as accounting and banking, are; these latter two industries require far fewer workers in the 2010s due to the development of computer programs.]]
The seminal paper by William Baumol and Bowen introduced the term [[Baumol's cost disease|cost disease]] for a relative cost growth of live performances. This cost growth explains the increasing dependency of this kind of art on state subsidies. It occurs when the consumable good is labour itself. To understand this phenomenon, compare the change in the cost of performing the [[Molière]] play "[[Tartuffe]]" in 1664 and in 2007 with the change in cost of calculating a large number of sums from an accounting ledger. In 1664, you needed two hours and twelve actors to perform Molière's play, and it would take, say, twelve accountants working for two hours to add up all the sums in an accounting ledger. In 2007, a single accountant with a $10 calculator can add the sums in 20 minutes, but you still need two hours and twelve actors for the Molière play. Artists must make a considerable investment in [[human capital]] (e.g., training), and needs to be paid accordingly. The artists' pay needs to rise along with that of the population in general. As the latter is following the general productivity in the economy, the cost of a play will rise with general productivity, while the actors' productivity does not rise.

There are two lines of thought in subsequent literature on the economics of the performing arts:

*The first concentrates on the existence of productivity growth in some areas of production, thus contradicting the relevance of cost disease. Staying with the "Tartuffe" example, the same performance can be viewed by an ever-larger audience by improvements in the design of theatres, and by the introduction of microphones, television and recording.
*The second is concerned with the allocation of subsidies to the cultural sector. While these should be in the general public interest, they may have an income distribution effect, e.g. if they reduce cost to the relatively well-off part of society. This is the case when the well-off are overrepresented in the audiences of subsidized plays, or when subsidies go to a small elitist group of artists.

== Market for artworks ==
Two segments of the market in the visual arts can be distinguished: works of art that are familiar and have a history, and contemporary works that are more easily influenced by fashion and new discoveries. Both markets, however, are [[oligopoly|oligopolistic]], i.e., there are limited numbers of sellers and buyers ([[oligopsony]]). Two central questions on the working of the markets are: How are prices determined, and what is the [[rate of return|return]] on artworks, compared to the return on financial assets?

=== Price determination ===
Components of a work of art, like raw stone, tubes of paint or unpainted canvas, in general have a value much lower than the finished products, such as a sculpture or a finished painting. Also, the amount of labour needed to produce an item does not explain the big price differences between works of art. It seems that the value is much more dependent on potential buyers', and experts' perception of it. This perception has three elements: First, social value, which is the social status the buyer has by owning it. The artist thus has an "artistic capital". Second, the artistic value, compared to contemporary works, or as importance to later generations. Third, the price history of the item, if a buyer uses this for his expectation of a future price at which he might sell the item again (given the oligopolistic market structure).
Three kinds of economic agents determine these values. Specific experts like gallery owners or museum directors use the first, social value. Experts like art historians and art professors use the second, artistic value. Buyers who buy works of art as an investment use the third, the price history and expectations for future price increases.

=== Art market and investment ===
[[File:Asrlar Sadosi2012b.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fine art such as paintings are typically sold at [[auction]]s.]]
Some major financial institutions, banks and insurance companies, have had considerable return rates on investments in art works in the 1990s. These rates have not slowed down at the same time as the rates on [[stock exchange]]s, in the early 90's. This may indicate a [[diversification (finance)|diversification]] opportunity. Apart from this evidence of successful investment, the amount of data available has stimulated study of the market. Many works are sold on [[auction]]s. These transactions are thus very transparent. This has made it possible to establish price databases, with prices of some items going back to 1652. Empirical studies have shown that, on average, the [[rate of return|return]] on works of art has been lower than that on [[stock|equity]], with a [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] that is at least as high. An [[intangible asset|intangible]] gain in terms of pleasure of having a work of art could explain this partly. However, before interpreting the figures, it should be borne in mind that art is often exempt of many kinds of taxes. In 1986, Baumol made an estimate of an average yearly rate of return of 0.55 percent for works of art, against a rate of return of 2.5 percent for financial assets, over a 20-year period.

== Cultural industries ==
Some famous artworks such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' painting are not reproducible (at least in the sense of creating another copy that would be seen as equivalent in value), but there are many cultural goods whose value does not depend on a single, individual copy. Books, recordings, movies get some of their value from the existence of many copies of the original. These are the products of major cultural industries, which are the book industry, the music industry and the film industry. These markets are characterized by:
* '''Uncertainty of value'''. The demand for a good (market success) is hard to predict. For example, with movies, even if a film's plot, themes and selection of actors has been extensively tested using focus groups and polls, and even if the movie uses popular [[A-list]] actors, this film may still be a [[box office bomb]] (e.g., ''[[Gigli]]'', a 2003 American romantic comedy starring [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]]). On the other hand, a low-budget film by an unknown director and an unknown cast, such as ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' can surprise the industry by being a major hit. This uncertainty is a characteristic of an [[experience good]] such as films, TV shows, musical theatre shows and music concerts.
* '''Infinite variety'''. You can differentiate between regular consumer products, e.g. cars, on basis of its characteristics. For example, a hatchback can be purchased from a number of manufacturers with a set list of options (e.g., automatic transmission, standard transmission, convertible, etc.), with the different options requiring different charges. Many general products allow classification on a relatively small number of such characteristics. Cultural goods, however, have a very high number of characteristics, which, on top of that, often are subjective. For example, an early 1990s band with loud, [[distortion (music)|distorted]] [[electric guitar]] could be considered to be [[grunge]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[heavy metal music]] or [[alternative rock]] by different [[music critic]]s.  This makes cultural products hard to compare.
* '''High concentration in the products which are traded or sold'''. A major part of sales of cultural goods is in a very small number of [[bestseller]]s (e.g., with books), [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s (movies) or hit [[Single (music)|single]]s (pop music).
* '''Short [[product life cycle management|life cycle]]'''. Most cultural items are sold/traded shortly after their introduction or production. Some cultural goods, such as broadcast news, have little or no market value shortly after the broadcast. Of course, some cultural products may retain saleability for years or even decades, as with the small number of films that become [[cult movie]]s (e.g., ''[[Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'') or certain classic novels or albums that have enduring appeal (the "[[back catalogue]]" of a record label).
* '''High [[fixed cost]]s'''. There is high cost before introduction of a new artwork or cultural product. Making a movie can cost millions of dollars; however the marginal cost of making an additional copy of the DVD may cost less than a dollar.

=== Market structure ===
The important cultural industries tend to have an [[oligopolistic]] [[market structure]]. The market is dominated by a few major companies, with the rest of the market consisting of many small companies. The latter may act as a filter or as "gatekeepers" for the artistic supply. A small company with a successful artist or good quality roster can be bought by one of the major companies. Big conglomerates, pooling TV and film production, have existed for decades. The 1990s have seen some mergers extending beyond the industry as such, and mergers of hardware producers with content providers. Anticipated gains from [[synergy]] and [[market power]] have not been realised, and from the early 2000s there has been a trend towards organisation along sector lines.

== Economics of cultural heritage ==
[[Cultural heritage]] is reflected in goods and real estate. Management and [[regulatory economics|regulation]] of museums has come under study in this area.

=== Museums ===
[[File:The Otsuka Museum of Art20s3200.jpg|thumb|right200px|The [[Otsuka Museum of Art]] in Japan.]]
Museums, which have a conservatory role, and provide exhibitions to the general public, can be commercial, or on a non-profit base. In the second case, as they provide a [[public good]], they pose the problems related to these goods: should they be self-financing, or be subsidized ? One of the specific issues is the imbalance between the huge value of the collections in museums, and their budgets. Also, they are often located in places (city centres) where the cost of land is high, which limits their expansion possibilities. American museums exhibit only about half of their collection. Some museums in Europe, like the Pompidou Centre in France, show less than 5 percent of their collection. Apart from providing exhibitions, museums get proceeds from derived products, like catalogues and reproductions. They also produce at a more intangible level: They make collections. Out of so many pieces in the public domain, they make a selection based on their expertise, thus adding value to the mere existence of the items.

The dual goal of conservation and providing exhibitions obviously presents a choice. On the one hand the museum has, for conservation reasons, an interest in exhibiting as few items as possible, and it would select lesser known works and a specialized audience, to promote knowledge and research. On the other hand, the exhibition argument requires showing the major pieces from different cultures, to satisfy the demands from the public and to attract a large audience. When a government has made a choice about this, application of economic [[contract theory]] will help to implement this choice by showing how to use incentives to different managers (on the financial, conservatory side) to obtain the required result.

=== Real estate and buildings  ===
[[File:Wr Neustaedter Dom.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In many countries, historic buildings such as cathedrals are considered to be "heritage buildings" and as such they are protected against demolition or substantial modifications.]]
Many countries have systems that protect historically significant buildings and structures. These are buildings or other structures that are deemed to have cultural importance or which are deemed to have heritage value. Owners get tax deductions or subsidies for restoration, in return for which they accept restrictions on modifications to the buildings or provide public access. Buildings that are often classified as heritage buildings include former or current Parliament buildings, cathedrals, courthouses, houses built in a recognized historical style, and even fairly regular houses, if the house was formerly the home of a famous [[politician]], [[artist]] or inventor. Buildings with heritage status cannot typically be demolished. Depending on the nature of the heritage restrictions, the current owner may or may not be allowed to modify the outside or inside of the building. Such a system poses the same choice problems as museums do. There has been little study of this issue.

== Artists' labour market ==
The [[labour market]] for artists is characterized by:
* There is an '''extremely unequal [[income distribution]]''' within the market segment. A very small group of artists earn a high proportion of the total income, while the average income is low.
* There is a '''structural excess supply of labour'''. There are always more people who would like to earn their income as an artist than there is demand for artists and artworks. For example, there are far more young [[indie rock]] bands aspiring to careers in music than there are available paid contracts in the recording industry. Due to this excess supply of labour, a [[nightclub]] owner has so many local young bands requesting to play at her venue that she can offer them little or no payment for their performance.
* There are '''intangible returns to labour''', also called "nonpecuniary benefits" (this means non-financial, non-wage benefits). For example, a musician is able to spend her days creating beautiful music and working with other creative people, which is very satisfying. Due to these intangible returns, artists are often willing to accept lower wages than their qualifications would earn in a different market. For example, working with a famous musician may provide such great intangible benefits (e.g., it is exciting to meet and work with such a well-known performer) that a [[record producer]] may be able to ask musicians to record with the start musician for little or no payment.
* '''Non-separation of artist and work'''. While some workers in the cultural industries do not make a strong connection between their work tasks and their self-identity, for some types of artists, such as painters, sculptors and filmmakers, the image their artwork or creative output gives them is important to artists' sense of self. Whether this phenomenon occurs depends on a number of factors, such as the type of artistic job and individuals' perceptions. In the 2010s, many famous [[film director]]s view the movies they direct as directly identified with their artistic vision. However, an assistant director leading scenes in [[action film]]s may see him or herself as a worker in a cultural industry, and he/she may not feel artistically identified with the film's he/she works on.

=== Star system ===
[[File:Evan Rachel Wood (April 2009) 4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sherwin Rosen]] states that top stars have such high earnings because their movies sell more copies.]]
The term [[superstar (celebrity)|"star system"]], coined by [[Sherwin Rosen]], is used to explain why a very small number of the artists and creators in the market, such as the celebrity [[A-list]] actors and top [[pop singer]]s, earn most of the total earnings in a sector. Rosen's 1981 paper examined the economics of superstars to determine why “relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they engage.” Rosen argues that in superstar markets, "small differences in talent at the top of the distribution will translate into large differences in revenue." Rosen points out that "...sellers of higher talent charge only slightly higher prices than those of lower talent, but sell much larger quantities; their greater earnings come overwhelmingly from selling larger quantities than from charging higher prices".

In cultural industries, the uncertainty about the quality of a product plays a key role in this. The consumer does not really know how good the product is, until he or she has consumed it (think of a movie), and the producer is confronted with the typical uncertainty in a cultural industry. The consumer looks for guidance in the price, reputation, or a famous name on the cover or poster. As the producer understands this using a famous director, actor or singer affects demand, he or she is prepared to pay a lot for a name considered a sign of quality (a star). Indeed, authors like Adler and Ginsburgh have given evidence that star status is determined by chance: in a musical contest, results were highly correlated with the order of performance. This randomness has been used to explain why the labor supply in the sector remains excessive: given the extreme gains of a star, and an irrational behaviour, or particular preferences, with respect to chance, unsuccessful artists keep trying, even when they are earning their money mostly in a different trade, such as waiting tables. A second argument is the possibility of intangible returns to artists' labour in terms of social status and lifestyle. For example, even a struggling [[DJ]] spends most of her time onstage on [[nightclub]]s and [[rave]]s, which for some people is a desirable outcome.

=== Production structure ===
[[File:Set design by Philippe Chaperon for Act4 sc2 of Aida by Verdi 1880 Paris.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A painter who does canvases that hang in major museums and a professional set painter for opera or theatre are both skilled painters who do painting for a living. However, the former is more likely to view her/his paintings as part of her artistic expression and identity, whereas the latter is more likely to view her/himself as a craftsperson.]]

A case has been made for the existence of a different structure in the production of cultural goods . (See [[Cultural Institutions Studies]].) An artist often considers a product to be an expression of himself, while the ordinary craftsperson is only concerned with his product, as far as it affects his/her pay or salary. For example, a painter who creates artworks that are displayed in museums may view her paintings as her artistic expression. On the other hand, a scene painter for a music theatre company may see herself as a craftsperson who is paid by the hour for doing painting. The artist may thus want restrict the use of his or her product, and he/she may object if a museum uses a reproduction of his/her painting to help sell cars or liquor. On the other hand, the scene painter may not object to commercial re-uses of her set painting, as she/he may see it just as a regular job.

'''Energy modeling''' or '''energy system modeling''' is the process of building computer models of [[energy system]]s in order to analyze them.  Such models often employ [[scenario analysis]] to investigate different assumptions about the technical and economic conditions at play.  Outputs may include the system feasibility, [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, cumulative [[Cost|financial costs]], [[natural resource]] use, and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of the system under investigation.  A wide range of techniques are employed, ranging from broadly economic to broadly engineering.  [[Mathematical optimization]] is often used to determine the least-cost in some sense.  Models can be international, regional, national, municipal, or stand-alone in scope.  Governments maintain national energy models for [[energy policy]] development.

Energy models are usually intended to contribute variously to system operations, [[Engineering design process|engineering design]], or [[energy policy]] development.  This page concentrates on policy models.  Individual [[building energy simulation]]s are explicitly excluded, although they too are sometimes called energy models.  [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]-style [[integrated model]]s, which also contain a representation of the world energy system and are used to examine global transformation pathways through to 2050 or 2100 are not considered here in detail.

Energy modeling has increased in importance as the need for [[climate change mitigation]] has grown in importance.  The energy supply sector is the largest contributor to global [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|IPCC reports]] that climate change mitigation will require a fundamental transformation of the energy supply system, including the substitution of unabated (not captured by [[Carbon capture and storage|CCS]]) [[fossil fuel]] conversion technologies by low-GHG alternatives.&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"/&gt;

== Model types ==

A wide variety of model types are in use.  This section attempts to categorize the key types and their usage.  The divisions provided are not hard and fast and mixed-paradigm models exist.  In addition, the results from more general models can be used to inform the specification of more detailed models, and vice versa, thereby creating a [[hierarchy]] of models.  Models may, in general, need to capture "complex dynamics such as:
* energy system operation
* technology stock turnover
* technology innovation
* firm and household behaviour
* energy and non-energy capital investment and labour market adjustment dynamics leading to economic restructuring
* infrastructure deployment and urban planning"&lt;ref name="pye-and-bataille-2016"&gt;

Models may be limited in scope to the electricity sector or they may attempt to cover an energy system in its entirety (see below).

Most energy models are used for [[scenario analysis]].  A scenario is a coherent set of assumptions about a possible system.  New scenarios are tested against a baseline scenario – normally [[Business as usual (business)|business-as-usual]] (BAU) – and the differences in outcome noted.

The [[time horizon]] of the model is an important consideration.  Single-year models – set in either the present or the future (say 2050) – assume a non-evolving [[Capital (economics)|capital]] structure and focus instead on the operational dynamics of the system.  Single-year models normally embed considerable temporal (typically hourly resolution) and technical detail (such as individual generation plant and transmissions lines).  Long-range models – cast over one or more decades (from the present until say 2050) – attempt to encapsulate the structural evolution of the system and are used to investigate capacity expansion and energy system transition issues.

Models often use [[mathematical optimization]] to solve for redundancy in the specification of the system.  Some of the techniques used derive from [[operations research]].   Most rely on [[linear programming]] (including [[Linear programming#Integer unknowns|mixed-integer programming]]), although some use [[nonlinear programming]].  Solvers may use classical or [[Genetic programming|genetic optimisation]], such as [[CMA-ES]].  Models may be recursive-dynamic, solving sequentially for each time interval, and thus evolving through time.  Or they may be framed as a single forward-looking intertemporal problem, and thereby assume perfect foresight.  Single-year engineering-based models usually attempt to minimize the [[Long run and short run|short-run]] financial cost, while single-year market-based models use optimization to determine [[market clearing]].  Long-range models, usually spanning decades, attempt to minimize both the short and long-run costs as a single intertemporal problem.

The demand-side (or end-user domain) has historically received relatively scant attention, often modeled by just a simple [[demand curve]].  End-user energy demand curves, in the short-run at least, are normally found to be highly [[Elasticity (economics)|inelastic]].

As [[intermittent energy source]]s and [[energy demand management]] grow in importance, models have needed to adopt an hourly temporal resolution in order to better capture their real-time dynamics.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016b"&gt;

=== Electricity sector models ===

Electricity sector models are used to model electricity systems.  The scope may be national or regional, depending on circumstances.  For instance, given the presence of national interconnectors, the western European electricity system may be modeled in its entirety.

Engineering-based models usually contain a good characterization of the technologies involved, including the high-voltage [[Alternating current|AC]] [[transmission grid]] where appropriate.  Some models (for instance, models for Germany) may assume a single common bus or "copper plate" where the grid is strong.  The demand-side in electricity sector models is typically represented by a fixed [[load profile]].

Market-based models, in addition, represent the prevailing [[electricity market]], which may include [[Electricity market#Bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices|nodal pricing]].

[[Game theory]] and [[agent-based model]]s are used to capture and study [[Perfect competition|strategic behavior]] within [[electricity market]]s.&lt;ref name="david-and-wen-2000"&gt;

=== Energy system models ===

In addition to the electricity sector, energy system models include the heat, gas, mobility, and other sectors as appropriate.&lt;ref name="abrell-and-weigt-2012"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy system models are often national in scope, but may be municipal or international.

So-called ''top-down models'' are broadly economic in nature and based on either [[partial equilibrium]] or [[Computable general equilibrium|general equilibrium]].  General equilibrium models represent a specialized activity and require dedicated [[algorithms]].  Partial equilibrium models are more common.

So-called ''bottom-up models'' capture the engineering well and often rely on techniques from [[operations research]].  Individual plants are characterized by their efficiency curves (also known as input/output relations), nameplate capacities, investment costs ([[Capital expenditure|capex]]), and operating costs ([[Operating expense|opex]]).  Some models allow for these parameters to depend on external conditions, such as ambient temperature.&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2003"&gt;

== Established models ==

This section lists some of the major models in use.  These are typically run by national governments.

=== LEAP ===

LEAP (Long range Energy Alternatives Planning System) is a software tool for [[energy policy]] analysis and [[climate change mitigation]] assessment.&lt;ref name="sei-2012"&gt;
{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  LEAP was developed at the [[Stockholm Environment Institute]]'s (SEI) US Center.  LEAP can be used to examine city, statewide, national, and regional energy systems.  LEAP is normally used for forecast studies of between 20–50 years.  Most of its calculations occur at yearly intervals.  LEAP allows policy analysts to create and evaluate alternative [[Scenario analysis|scenarios]] and to compare their energy requirements, [[Social cost|social costs and benefits]], and environmental impacts.

=== Power System Simulation ===
[[General Electric]]'s MAPS (Multi-Area Production Simulation) is a production simulation model used by various [[Regional transmission organization (North America)|Regional Transmission Organizations]] and [[Regional transmission organization (North America)#Independent System Operators (ISOs)|Independent System Operators]] in the United States to plan for the economic impact of proposed electric transmission and generation facilities in FERC-regulated electric wholesale markets. Portions of the model may also be used for the commitment and dispatch phase (updated on 5 minute intervals) in operation of wholesale electric markets for RTO and ISO regions. [[ABB]]'s PROMOD is a similar software package. These ISO and RTO regions also utilize a GE software package called MARS (Multi-Area Reliability Simulation) to ensure the power system meets reliability criteria (a loss-of-load-expectation (LOLE) of no greater than 0.1 days per year). Further, a GE software package called PSLF (Positive Sequence Load Flow) and a [[Siemens]] software package called PSSE (Power System Simulation for Engineering) analyzes load flow on the power system for short-circuits and stability during preliminary planning studies by RTOs and ISOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABB PROMOD Market Simulation|url=https://new.abb.com/enterprise-software/energy-portfolio-management/market-analysis/promod|work=new.abb.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Multi-Area Production Simulation|url=https://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/maps|work=www.geenergyconsulting.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Multi-Area Reliability Simulation|url=https://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/mars|work=www.geenergyconsulting.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Power System Load Flow Simulation|url=https://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/pslf|work=www.geenergyconsulting.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYSRC 2018 IRM Study Report|url=http://www.nysrc.org/pdf/Reports/2018%20IRM%20Study%20Report%20Final%2012-8-17[2098].pdf|p=2|work=www.nysrc.org|date=December 8, 2017|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYISO Notice to Stakeholders of Request for MAPS data|url=https://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/markets_operations/documents/Legal_and_Regulatory/Notices/MP_Notices/Notice%20to%20Generators%20re%20GE%20MAPS%20database%20input%20files%20for%20CARIS%202%20-%209-9-14.pdf|work=www.nyiso.com|date=August 2000|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Siemens PSSE|url=https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home/products/energy/services/transmission-distribution-smart-grid/consulting-and-planning/pss-software/pss-e.html|work=www.siemens.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York State Resource Planning Analysis (NYSPSC)|url=https://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/markets_operations/committees/mc/meeting_materials/2015-12-17/Agenda%2004_NYSDPS%20SRP%20Presentation_revised.pdf|work=www.nyiso.com|date=December 17, 2015|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MARKAL/TIMES ===

{{main|MARKAL}}

MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) is an integrated energy systems modeling platform, used to analyze energy, economic, and environmental issues at the global, national, and municipal level over time-frames of up to several decades.  MARKAL can be used to quantify the impacts of policy options on technology development and natural resource depletion.  The software was developed by the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme (ETSAP) of the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) over a period of almost two decades.

TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) is an evolution of MARKAL – both energy models have many similarities.&lt;ref name="comparison-times-markal-2009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Both models are technology explicit, dynamic [[partial equilibrium]] models of [[energy market]]s. In both cases, the equilibrium is determined by maximizing the total [[Economic surplus|consumer and producer surplus]] via [[linear programming]].  Both MARKAL and TIMES are written in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]].

The TIMES model generator was also developed under the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Program (ETSAP).  TIMES combines two different, but complementary, systematic approaches to modeling energy – a technical engineering approach and an economic approach.  TIMES is a technology rich, bottom-up model generator, which uses [[linear programming]] to produce a least-cost energy system, optimized according to a number of user-specified constraints, over the medium to long-term.  It is used for "the exploration of possible energy futures based on contrasted scenarios".&lt;ref name="loulou-etal-2005"&gt;

=== NEMS ===

{{main|National Energy Modeling System}}

[[National Energy Modeling System|NEMS]] (National Energy Modeling System) is a long-standing United States government policy model, run by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE).  NEMS computes equilibrium fuel prices and quantities for the US energy sector.  To do so, the software iteratively solves a sequence of linear programs and nonlinear equations.&lt;ref name="gabriel-etal-1999"&gt;

== Criticisms ==

Public policy energy models have been criticized for being insufficiently [[Open research|transparent]].  The [[source code]] and data sets should at least be available for [[peer review]], if not explicitly published.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016a"&gt;

'''EuroNanoForum''' ('''ENF''') nanotechnology conferences are organised within the framework of national presidencies of the European Council and supported by the European Union, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation.

The first conference EuroNanoForum 2003, held in Trieste during the Italian Presidency, enabled the European Commission to present the key elements for an integrated and responsible approach and a common strategy for the future on nanotechnology research. It brought to the issue of a Commission Communication in 2004, and to the preparation of an Action Plan for Europe for the period 2005–2009. The second conference EuroNanoForum 2005 took place in Edinburgh was focused on “Nanotechnology and the Health of the EU Citizen in 2020”. The aim of the conference was to promote developments in nanotechnology that are leading to innovative solutions for health and healthcare in Europe as part of an integrated and responsible approach presented in Trieste. The third conference EuroNanoForum 2007 took place in Düsseldorf addressing “Nanotechnology in industrial applications”. The aim of the conference was to promote on for the nanotechnology transfer from research into industrial production processes, products and applications that can improve the competitiveness of European industry.

[[EuroNanoForum 2009]] conference, held in Prague&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praguepost.com/print/897-prague-to-host-nano-forum.html|title=Prague to host nano forum|last=Abdulrehman|first=Shariffa |date=2009-03-26|publisher=[[Prague Post]]|accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the frame of the Czech presidency, addressed “Nanotechnology for sustainable economy”. The focus was to grow opportunity and responsibility to leveraging nanotechnology to reduce pollution, conserve resources and, ultimately, build a "clean" environmentally sustainable economy as well as to address concerns for the safe and responsible the development of nanotechnology.&lt;ref name=cordis&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/nanotechnology/src/euronanoforum.htm euronanoforum 2009], Cordis.europa.eu. Retrieved July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[EuroNanoForum 2011]] took place in Budapest during Hungarian EU Presidency. The event explored how nanotechnology could contribute to sustainable solutions for Grand Challenges faced by European society and businesses in several areas, such as global warming, tightening supplies of energy, water and food, ageing societies, public health, pandemics and security with the overarching challenge of turning Europe into an eco-efficient economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronanoforum2011.eu/ EuroNanoForum 2011].

The event was hosted under the auspices of the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The speakers initiated a thriving discussion about the future of nanotechnology, its economic and technological impact on European growth and the commercialisation challenges of nanoproducts. Speakers agreed that it requires the understanding of industrial needs, focused R&amp;D and suitable funding instruments, as well as the identification of areas where nanotechnology is most likely to have impact. One of the event highlights was [http://www.spinverse.com/u2-guitarist-the-edge-at-euronanoforum-2013-we-need-to-dream-up-the-kind-of-world-we-want-to-live-in/ a video message] by [[U2]]’s guitarist, David Howell Evans, better known as [[The Edge]], to all delegates asking them to live the dreams to change the world for the better, also in the world of science.

The [http://www.euronanoforum2015.eu/ EuroNanoForum 2015] will take place in [[Riga]] in June 2015, during the Latvian Presidency of the European Council. It is Europe’s largest networking conference on nanotechnologies and advanced materials science, innovations and business.

The '''European Consortium for Political Research''' ('''ECPR''') is an independent scholarly association that supports and encourages the training, research and cross-national cooperation of many thousands of academics and graduate students specialising in political science and all its sub-disciplines. ECPR membership is institutional rather than individual and, at its inception in 1970, comprised eight members ([[University of Bergen|Bergen]], [[University of Gothenburg|Gothenburg]], [[University of Essex|Essex]], [[Leiden University|Leiden]], [[University of Mannheim|Mannheim]], [[Nuffield College]] ([[University of Oxford|Oxford]]), [[University of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] and [[Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques|Paris (FNSP)]]). Membership has now grown to encompass more than 350 institutions throughout [[Europe]], with associate members spread across the world.

;ECPR activities include
* Organising workshops, roundtables, conferences and summer schools
* Publishing journals, books, articles and newsletters
* Providing a comprehensive European information source for political scientists through its website, electronic bulletin and online searchable databases
* Promoting teaching and training and the discipline in general through the professional journal [[European Political Science]] (EPS) and summer schools.

The ECPR has close links with similar organisations, such as the [[American Political Science Association]] (APSA), European national associations and the [[International Political Science Association]] (IPSA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8051">'''Feminist HCI''' is a subfield of [[human-computer interaction]] (commonly called HCI) that focuses on helping the field of  HCI build interactions that pay attention to [[gender]], [[Gender equality|equity]], and [[social justice]] in [[research]] and in the [[Design|design process]].

==Overview==
Feminist HCI sets a stage for the explicit inclusion of [[feminism]] in HCI. Starting with Shaowen Bardzell's 2010 article "Feminist HCI: Taking Stock and Outlining an Agenda for Design", feminist HCI looks to the design and evaluation of interactive computing systems from a [[feminism|feminist]] lens.&lt;ref name=Bardzell_1&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bardzell|first1=Shaowen|title=Feminist HCI: Taking Stock and Outlining an Agenda for Design|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2010|pages=1301–1310|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753521|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1753521|isbn=9781605589299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building off of the epistemology of [[Standpoint feminism|feminist standpoint theory]], feminist HCI is focused on highlighting the values feminism in HCI work, like equity, diversity, and social justice, as well as on understanding the relationship gender has to the design and evaluation of interactive systems. Given that feminism is a heterogeneous concept, there is no singular methodology for undertaking feminist HCI projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bardzell|first1=Shaowen|last2=Bardzell|first2=Jeffrey|title=Towards a Feminist HCI Methodology: Social Science, Feminism, and HCI|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2011|pages=675–684|doi=10.1145/1978942.1979041|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1979041|isbn=9781450302289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bridging the gap between feminism and HCI, Feminist HCI has applications in theory, methodology, user research, and evaluation that will allow practitioners to critique systems already in place as well as generate new HCI practices focused on gender, equity, and social justice. Theoretical contributions of feminism like the [[Feminist technoscience|masculinity of technology]] and the [[Social construction of gender|social production of gender]] point towards the importance of addressing gender and equity directly in HCI.&lt;ref name=Rode&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rode|first1=Jennifer A.|title=A theoretical agenda for feminist HCI|journal=Interacting with Computers|date=2011|volume=23|issue=5|pages=393–400|url=https://academic.oup.com/iwc/article-abstract/23/5/393/653472|doi=10.1016/j.intcom.2011.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualities of feminist interaction==
Building off of interaction design, Feminist HCI builds on six core qualities to feminist interaction:&lt;ref name="Bardzell_1" /&gt;
* '''[[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralism]]''': Building on [[Standpoint feminism|feminist standpoint theory]], this quality argues that human experience is too varied to be captured within the concept of [[universalism]], thus pluralism, or heterogeneity, in design is of critical importance to HCI work.  
* '''[[Participation (decision making)|Participation]]''': Engaging users as active contributors to the design process (e.g., [[participatory design]]) is important for understanding and respecting the full range of contributions users can make. Feminist HCI argues that this work should occur alongside traditional [[usability testing]].  
* '''[[Advocacy]]''': Articulating concerns with the values that get built into a design by championing for well-motivated of ideas for creating just design choices. For instance, a [[needs analysis]] may reinforce discriminatory design behavior like design choices criticized by [[Gender HCI]]. Participatory approaches, like [[participatory design]], support advocacy.
* '''[[Human ecology|Ecology]]''': Maintaining a focus on the larger social structures (ecosystems) that a design impacts throughout the process of development. For example, the way a house is designed has an impact on structuring the lives of people who live in it (see [[feminism and modern architecture]] for additional information). Likewise, HCI artifacts exist within a larger ecosystem that impacts both the design process and the user. 
* '''[[Embodied embedded cognition|Embodiment]]''': Contrasting from earlier HCI notions of a disembodied user (such as [[Human–computer interaction#Mental model principles|mental models]]), concentrating on the material attributes of human-computer interactions is essential for understanding the way differences and commonalities impact interaction. 
* '''[[Reflexivity (social theory)|Self-disclosure]]''': Bringing to light the foundational assumptions inherent in everyday design allows us to understand how well the design model of a user matches the actual users.

==Select feminist HCI findings==
The following presents a sampling of results from research utilizing feminist HCI:

*''Six qualities of feminist interaction in an activist [[online community]].''
** Jill Dimond et al.'s studies of [[Hollaback!]] outlines how activist [[Computer-supported cooperative work|CSCW]] systems embody Feminist HCI in concrete ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dimond|first1=Jill|title=Feminist HCI for real: Designing technology in support of a social movement|date=2012|url=https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/45778|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|hdl=1853/45778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Dimond|first1=Jill P.|last2=Dye|first2=Michaelanne|last3=Larose|first3=Daphne|last4=Bruckman|first4=Amy S.|title=Hollaback!: The Role of Storytelling Online in a Social Movement Organization|journal=Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work|date=2013|pages=477–490|doi=10.1145/2441776.2441831|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2441831|isbn=9781450313315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, these studies examine feminist HCI through activist online communities describing how the six qualities of feminist interaction design play out in the work and experiences of site designers and site users.
*''Designing [[postpartum]] technologies by and for mothers using feminist HCI.''
** Catherine D'Ignazio et al.'s work highlights participation, advocacy, and ecology to improve [[breast pump]] technologies. By getting input from more than 1000 mothers, researchers put forth a number of improvements that could be made to the breast pump while discussing the wider impacts this type of research can make on improving postpartum technologies broadly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=D'Ignazio|first1=Catherine|last2=Hope|first2=Alexis|last3=Michelson|first3=Becky|last4=Churchill|first4=Robyn|last5=Zuckerman|first5=Ethan|title=A Feminist HCI Approach to Designing Postpartum Technologies: "When I First Saw a Breast Pump I Was Wondering if It Was a Joke"|journal=Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2016|pages=2612–2622|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2858460|doi=10.1145/2858036.2858460|isbn=9781450333627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: Woman-power emblem.svg|thumb|upright|A generic symbol for feminism]]
'''Feminist political theory''' is a diverse subfield of [[feminist theory]] working towards three main goals:
# To understand and critique the role of gender in how [[political theory]] is conventionally construed.
# To re-frame and re-articulate conventional [[political theory]] in light of feminist issues (especially gender equality).
# To support [[political science]] presuming and pursuing gender equality.
Feminist political theory encompasses a broad scope of approaches. It overlaps with related areas including feminist jurisprudence/[[feminist legal theory]]; feminist political philosophy; female-centered empirical research in political science; and feminist research methods ([[feminist method]]) for use in political science the social sciences. Indeed, one scholar notes that, insofar as almost all versions of feminism involve "demonstrating the ways in which politics, understood as power relations, is present in our everyday lives," one could reasonably "describe feminist theory as a whole as a kind of political philosophy."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminist Political Theory|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee757/abstract|publisher = Blackwell Publishing Ltd|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9781444367072|doi = 10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee757/full|first = Lori|last = Watson}}&lt;/ref&gt; What frequently distinguishes feminist political theory from feminism broadly is the specific examination of the state and its role in the reproduction or redressing of gender inequality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to being broad and multidisciplinary, the field is relatively new, inherently innovative, and still expanding; the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' explains that "feminist political philosophy serves as a field for developing new ideals, practices, and justifications for how political institutions and practices should be organized and reconstructed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Summer 2014|title = Feminist Political Philosophy|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/feminism-political/|date = 2014-01-01|first = Noëlle|last = McAfee|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
For summary of feminist history more broadly, see [[feminism]]. Feminist political theory as a term only consolidated in the West during Women's Liberation movements of the 1960s and 70s. Previously, very few works of political theory explicitly considered women's political situation. John Stuart Mill’s 1861 call for women's suffrage in ''The Subjection of Women'' is a notable exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = John Stuart Mill: The Subjection of Women|url = http://www.constitution.org/jsm/women.htm|website = www.constitution.org|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th Century, Simone de Beauvoir’s 1949 work ''The Second Sex'' exposed the power dynamics surrounding womanhood and laid the foundation for subsequent feminist theories exposing women's social subjugation. In the 1980s and 1990s, feminist theory expanded into the legal realm led by Catharine MacKinnon’s and Andrea Dworkin’s campaigns against pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = philosophical feminism|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophical-feminism|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several distinct stages are sketched out below.

=== Liberal feminism ===
[[Liberal feminism]] marks an important approach to feminist politics which was especially pervasive during the first half of the twentieth century. Some of the most well known examples of liberal feminist writing were published far earlier,  including [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1869). A common theme of liberal feminism is an emphasis on equal opportunity via fair opportunity and equal political rights. In addition, according to ''The International Encyclopedia of Ethics,'' "[L]iberal feminisms of both the past and the present retain some commitment to the distinction between the public and private realms – a distinction [which is the] focus of much critique within feminist political theory."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Marxist, socialist and radical feminism ===
Marxist feminism and socialist feminism considered classism as the primary source of women's oppression&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism: Towards a More Progressive Union|last=Hartmann|first=Heidi|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0-415-93152-5|location=Feminist Theory Reader (Eds: McCann &amp; Kim)|pages=206-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pandora's Box: Subjectivity, class, and sexuality in socialist feminist criticism|last=Kaplan|first=Cora|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=1985|isbn=0-8135-2388-5|location=Feminisms (1997) (Eds: Warhol &amp; Herndl)|pages=956-975}}&lt;/ref&gt;. "... Marxist theory does not allow women any more than other classes of oppressed people to constitute themselves as historical subjects, because Marxism does not take into account the fact that a class also consists of individuals one by one. Class consciousness is not enough. We must try to understand philosophically (politically) these concepts of 'subject' and 'class consciousness' and how they work in relation to our history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One is Not Born a Woman|last=Wittig|first=Monique|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0-415-93152-5|location=Feminist Theory Reader, Eds: McCann &amp; Kim)|pages=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Early radical feminism was grounded in the rejection of the nuclear family and femininity as constructed within heterosexuality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967-1975|last=Echols|first=Alice|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0816617876|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. and Radical feminism abdicated any previous forms of political theory to develop entirely new theories rooted primarily on the direct experiences of women.

== Topics of inquiry ==
=== Feminist epistemology ===
A key aspect of feminist political theory/philosophy is feminist epistemology. Feminist epistemologists question the objectivity of social and philosophical sciences by contending that standards of authority and credibility are socially constructed and thus reflect and re-entrench the sociopolitical status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = philosophical feminism|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophical-feminism|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, one common feminist methodological solution is to include many diverse voices reflecting all parts of society in the process of knowledge-making.

=== Gendered political institutions ===
Political theory on the gendering of institutions explores questions such what does it mean for an institution to be “gendered," how can one evaluate whether an institution is gendered, and what are the consequences of gendered institutions for the people who work within them (of all genders). An example of such related scholarship is Eileen McDonagh's book ''The Motherless State'' which explores how socially feminized "motherly" attributes have been stripped from modern governance models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Motherless State|last = McDonagh|first = Eileen|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Chicago|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Group identity/identity politics ===
Theorist studying this aspect of feminist political theory question the construction of women as an identity group. On a basic level, they consider whether it is even possible to come to some sort of conclusion about a "women" group’s relation to politics. One facet of the debate involves [[intersectionality]] and whether women from different racial and cultural backgrounds have enough in common to form a political group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Should Blacks Represent Blacks and Women Represent Women? A Contingent Yes|last = Mansbridge|first = Jane|date = 1999|journal = Journal of Politics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another facet questions whether transgender women should be included in the group "women" insofar as they lack many of the experiences of girlhood and womanhood which bind "women" together as a distinct group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Dispute Between Radical Feminism and Transgenderism|url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/woman-2|website = The New Yorker|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another approach to this topic includes redefining "groupness;" for example, Iris Marion Young has suggested women are more of a "seriality" rather than a group insofar as they undergo similar experiences but in isolation of each other, lacking a sense of group identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender as Seriality: Thinking About Women as a Social Collective|last = Young|first = Iris Marion|date = 1994|journal = Signs|doi =10.1086/494918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political leadership and gender ===
This field address how women lead differently than their male counterparts as legislators, executives, and judges. Some scholars in this field study how political leadership is itself masculinized to exclude the kinds of political leadership women most frequently provide, often outside of formal offices. For example, Hardy-Fanta looks at grassroots political work in Latino communities in the U.S. to identify feminized political leadership roles, ultimately concluding that Latina women provide the most critical leadership and work in those communities—despite the fact that most studies overlook their leadership because it does  not occur within formal officeholding roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Latina Women and Political Leadership|last = Hardy-Fanta|first = Carol|date = 1995|journal = New England Journal of Public Policy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Figure of Insensitiveness''' (or ''F of I'') is an inverse scale of measure of the impact sensitivity of an explosive substance.  In this particular context the term 'Insensitiveness' refers to the likelihood of initiation/[[detonation]] by accidental means e.g. impact, friction, electrostatic discharge, application of flame, etc. It is a quantitative measure of the level of stimulus required to cause initiation, typically by shock/impact. 

The Figure of Insensitiveness is determined from impact testing, typically using a drop-weight tower. In this test, a small sample of the explosive is placed on a small steel anvil which  is slotted into a recess in the base of the drop tower. A cylindrical, 1 kilogram steel weight (mounted inside a tube to accurately guide its descent to the impact point in the centre of the anvil) is then dropped onto the test specimen from a measured height. The specimen is monitored both during and after this process to determine whether initiation occurs. This test is repeated many times, varying the drop height according to a prescribed method. Various heights are used, starting with a small distance (e.g. 10&amp;nbsp;cm) and then progressively increasing it to as high as 3 metres. The series of drop heights and whether initiation occurred are analysed statistically to determine the drop height which has a 50% likelihood of initiating the explosives. The intention of these tests is to develop safety policies/rules which will govern the design, manufacturing, handling and storage of the explosive and any munitions containing it.

A reference standard sample of [[RDX]] is currently used to calibrate the drop tower, so that the drop height to produce 50% likelihood of initiation in this material is measured and recorded. The drop height required to initiate other explosives can then be related to the RDX standard, so that a ready comparison of impact sensitiveness between different explosives can be made.  By convention, explosives having a 50% initiation drop height equal to that of RDX are given a F of I of 80.

The scale was originally defined using [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] as the reference standard, with TNT having, by definition, an F of I of exactly 100. On this original scale, RDX yielded an F&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;I of around 80.  Following [[World War II]], when more complex explosive compositions replaced pure TNT as the most common energetic component of weapon systems, RDX was adopted as the reference standard.

Sensitiveness should not be confused with ''Sensitivity'' which is a measure of how easy it is to detonate an explosive, i.e. how sensitive it is to the mode of initiation to achieve a detonation.  In this context an explosive which has greater sensitivity, (like specificity) requires a more specific stimulus in order to detonate it.

'''Hermann Joseph Muller''' (December 21, 1890 – April 5, 1967) was an American [[geneticist]], educator, and [[Nobel laureate]] best known for his work on the physiological and genetic effects of [[radiation]] ([[mutagenesis]]), as well as his outspoken political beliefs.&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Elof Axel Carlson|Carlson, Elof Axel]] |title=Genes, radiation, and society: the life and work of H. J. Muller |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y |year=1981 |pages= |isbn=0-8014-1304-4 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Muller frequently warned of long-term dangers of [[radioactive fallout]] from [[nuclear war]] and [[nuclear testing]], which resulted in greater public scrutiny of these practices.

==Early life==
Muller was born in [[New York City]], the son of Frances (Lyons) and Hermann Joseph Muller, Sr., an artisan who worked with metals. Muller was a third-generation American whose
father's ancestors were originally Catholic and came to the United States from [[Koblenz]].&lt;ref name="nas biography"/&gt; His mother's family was of mixed Jewish (descended from Spanish and Portuguese Jews) and Anglican background, and had come from Britain.&lt;ref name="nas biography"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1946/muller-bio.html?print=1 |title=Hermann J. Muller - Biographical |work=NobelPrice.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his first cousins are [[Herbert J. Muller]] and [[Alfred Kroeber]] whose daughter is [[Ursula Le Guin]].&lt;ref name="nas biography"/&gt; As an adolescent, he attended a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church and considered himself a [[pantheist]]; in high school, he became an [[atheist]]. He excelled in the public schools. At 16, he entered [[Columbia University|Columbia College]]. From his first semester, he was interested in biology; he became an early convert of the [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]]-[[chromosome]] theory of heredity — and the concept of genetic [[mutation]]s and [[natural selection]] as the basis for [[evolution]]. He formed a biology club and also became a proponent of [[eugenics]]; the connections between biology and society would be his perennial concern. Muller earned a [[bachelor of arts]] degree in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 17-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Muller remained at Columbia (the pre-eminent American zoology program at the time, due to [[Edmund Beecher Wilson|E. B. Wilson]] and his students) for graduate school. He became interested in the ''[[Drosophila]]'' genetics work of [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]'s fly lab after undergraduate bottle washers [[Alfred Sturtevant]] and [[Calvin Bridges]] joined his biology club. In 1911-1912, he studied metabolism at [[Cornell University]], but remained involved with Columbia. He followed the [[drosophilist]]s as the first genetic maps emerged from Morgan's experiments, and joined Morgan's group in 1912 (after two years of informal participation).&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 37-69&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fly group, Muller's contributions were primarily theoretical - explanations for experimental results and ideas and predictions for new experiments. In the emerging collaborative culture of the drosophilists, however, credit was assigned based on results rather than ideas; Muller felt cheated when he was left out of major publications.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 70-90; for more on the culture and norms of the fly lab, see {{cite book |author=Kohler, Robert E. |title=Lords of the fly: Drosophila genetics and the experimental life |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-226-45063-5 |oclc= |doi= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1914, [[Julian Huxley]] offered Muller a position at the recently founded William Marsh Rice Institute, now [[Rice University]]; he hurried to complete his [[Doctor of philosophy]] degree and moved to Houston for the beginning of the 1915-1916 academic year (his degree was issued in 1916). At Rice, Muller taught biology and continued ''Drosophila'' lab work. In 1918, he proposed an explanation for the dramatic discontinuous alterations in ''[[Oenothera larmarckiana]]'' that were the basis of [[Hugo de Vries]]'s
theory of [[mutationism]]: "balanced lethals" allowed the accumulation of recessive mutations, and rare [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]] events resulted in the sudden expression of these hidden traits. In other words, de Vries's experiments were explainable by the Mendelian-chromosome theory. Muller's work was increasingly focused on [[mutation rate]] and [[lethal mutation]]s. In 1918, Morgan, short-handed because many of his students and assistants were drafted for the U.S. entry into [[World War I]], convinced Muller to return to Columbia to teach and to expand his experimental program.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 91-108&lt;/ref&gt;

At Columbia, Muller and his collaborator and longtime friend [[Edgar Altenburg]] continued the investigation of lethal mutations. The primary method for detecting such mutations was to measure the sex ratios of the offspring of female flies. They predicted the ratio would vary from 1:1 due to recessive mutations on the X chromosome, which would be expressed only in males (which lacked the functional allele on a second X chromosome). Muller found a strong temperature dependence in mutation rate, leading him to believe that spontaneous mutation was the dominant mode (and to initially discount the role of external factors such as ionizing radiation or chemical agents). In 1920, Muller and Altenburg coauthored a seminal paper in ''[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]'' on "modifier genes" that determine the size of mutant ''Drosophila'' wings. In 1919, Muller made the important discovery of a mutant (later found to be a [[chromosomal inversion]]) that appeared to suppress crossing over, which opened up new avenues in mutation-rate studies. However, his appointment at Columbia was not continued; he accepted an offer from the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] and left Columbia after the summer of 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 109-119&lt;/ref&gt;

Muller taught at the University of Texas from 1920 until 1932. Soon after returning to Texas, he married mathematics professor [[Jessie Marie Jacobs Muller Offermann|Jessie Marie Jacobs]], whom he had courted previously. In his early years at Texas, Muller's ''Drosophila'' work was slow going; the data from his mutation rate studies were difficult to interpret. In 1923, he began using [[radium]] and [[X-rays]],&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=Vivien|title=The Secrets of Life: Historian Luis Campos resurrects radium's role in early genetics research|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2 |pages=44–45 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-secrets-of-life|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the relationship between radiation and mutation was difficult to measure because such radiation also sterilized the flies. In this period, he also became involved with eugenics and human genetics. He carried out a study of twins separated at birth that seemed to indicate a strong hereditary component to [[I.Q.]] Muller was critical of the new directions of the eugenics movement (such as anti-immigration), but was hopeful about the prospects for positive eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 120-140&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1932, at the [[International Eugenics Conference| Third International Eugenics Congress]], Muller gave a speech and stated, "eugenics might yet perfect the human race, but only in a society consciously organized for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/eugenics-crusade/#part01 |title=The Eugenics Crusade What's Wrong with Perfect? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=October 16, 2018 |website= |publisher=PBS |access-date=November 4, 2018 |quote=There is no scientific basis for the conclusion that the socially lower class have genetically inferior intellectual equipment. Certain slum districts of our cities are factories for criminality among those who happen to be born in them.  Under these circumstances, it is society, not the individual, which is the real criminal and which stands to be judged.  Eugenics might yet perfect the human race, but only in a society consciously organized for the common good.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of X-ray mutagenesis===
In 1926, a series of major breakthroughs began. In November, Muller carried out two experiments with varied doses of X-rays, the second of which used the crossing over suppressor stock ("ClB") he had found in 1919. A clear, quantitative connection between radiation and lethal mutations quickly emerged. Muller's discovery created a media sensation after he delivered a paper entitled "The Problem of Genetic Modification" at the Fifth International Congress of Genetics in [[Berlin]]; it would make him one of the better-known public intellectuals of the early 20th century. By 1928, others had replicated his dramatic results, expanding them to other [[model organism]]s, such as [[wasp]]s and [[maize]]. In the following years, he began publicizing the likely dangers of radiation exposure in humans (such as physicians who frequently operate X-ray equipment).&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 141-164&lt;/ref&gt;

His lab grew quickly, but it shrank again following the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. Especially after the stock market crash, Muller was increasingly pessimistic about the prospects of [[capitalism]]. Some of his visiting lab members were from the [[USSR]], and he helped edit and distribute an illegal leftist student newspaper, ''The Spark''. It was a difficult period for Muller both scientifically and personally; his marriage was falling apart, and he was increasingly dissatisfied with his life in Texas. Meanwhile, the waning of the eugenics movement, ironically hastened by his own work pointing to the previously ignored connections between environment and genetics, meant that his ideas on the future of human evolution had reduced impact in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 165-183&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in Europe===
In September 1932, Muller moved to Berlin to work with the Russian expatriate geneticist [[Nikolay Timofeeff-Ressovsky]]; a trip intended as a limited sabbatical stretched into an eight-year, five-country journey. In Berlin, he met two physicists who would later be significant to the biology community: [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Max Delbrück]]. The [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] movement was precipitating the rapid emigration of scientific talent from Germany, and Muller was particularly opposed to the politics of National Socialism. The FBI was investigating Muller because of his involvement with ''The Spark'', so he chose instead to go to the Soviet Union (an environment better suited to his political beliefs). In 1933, Muller and his wife reconciled, and their son [[David E. Muller]] and she moved with Hermann to [[Leningrad]]. There, at the Institute of Genetics, he imported the basic equipment for a ''Drosophila'' lab—including the flies—and set up shop. The Institute was moved to [[Moscow]] in 1934, and Muller and his wife were divorced in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 184-203&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USSR, Muller supervised a large and productive lab, and organized work on medical genetics. Most of his work involved further explorations of genetics and radiation. There he completed his eugenics book, ''Out of the Night'', the main ideas of which dated to 1910.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Muller, ''Out of the Night: A Biologist's View of the Future'' (New York: Vangard, 1935), p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1936, however, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s repressive policies and the rise of [[Lysenkoism]] was making the USSR an increasingly problematic place to live and work. Muller and many of the Russian genetics community did what they could to oppose [[Trofim Lysenko]] and his [[Lamarckism|Larmarckian]] evolutionary theory, but Muller was soon forced to leave the Soviet Union after Stalin read a translation of his eugenics book and was "displeased by it, and...ordered an attack prepared against it."&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 204-234; quotation from p 233, correspondence from Muller to Julian Huxley, March 9, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

Muller, with about 250 strains of ''Drosophila'', moved to [[Edinburgh]] in September 1937, after  brief stays in [[Madrid]] and [[Paris]]. In 1938, with war on the horizon, he began looking for a permanent position back in the United States. He also began courting Dorothea "Thea" Kantorowicz, a German refugee; they were married in May 1939. The Seventh International Congress on Genetics was held in Edinburgh later that year; Muller wrote a "Geneticists' Manifesto"&lt;ref&gt;"The 'Geneticists Manifesto'," originally published in ''Journal of Heredity'', 1939, 30:371-73; reprinted in H. J. Muller, ''Studies in Genetics: The Selected Papers of H. J. Muller'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1962), pp. 545-548.&lt;/ref&gt; in response to the question: "How could the world's population be improved most effectively genetically?" He also engaged in a debate with the perennial genetics gadfly [[Richard Goldschmidt]] over the existence of the gene, for which  little direct physical evidence remained.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 235-273&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
[[File:First Street 1001, Muller House, Vinegar Hill HD.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Muller's house in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]]]

When Muller returned to the United States in 1940, he took an untenured research position at [[Amherst College]], in the department of [[Otto C. Glaser]]. After the U.S. entry into [[World War II]], his position was extended indefinitely and expanded to include teaching. His ''Drosophila'' work in this period focused on measuring the rate of spontaneous (as opposed to radiation-induced) mutations. Muller's publication rate decreased greatly in this period, from a combination of lack of lab workers and experimentally challenging projects. However, he also worked as an adviser in the [[Manhattan Project]] (though he did not know that was what it was), as well as a study of the mutational effects of [[radar]]. Muller's appointment was ended after the 1944–1945 academic year, and despite difficulties stemming from his socialist political activities, he found a position as professor of zoology at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 274–288&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, he lived in a [[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Colonial Revival]] house in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]'s [[Vinegar Hill Historic District|Vinegar Hill]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory.

In 1946, Muller was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], "for the discovery that mutations can be induced by X-rays". Genetics, and especially the physical and physiological nature of the gene, was becoming a central topic in biology, and X-ray mutagenesis was a key to many recent advances, among them [[George Beadle]] and [[Edward Tatum]]'s work on ''[[Neurospora]]'' that established in 1941 the [[one gene-one enzyme hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="Carlson, pp 304-318"&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 304–318&lt;/ref&gt; In Muller's Nobel Prize lecture, he argued that no threshold dose of radiation existed that did not produce [[mutagenesis]], which led to the adoption of the [[linear no-threshold model]] of radiation on cancer risks.&lt;ref name="calabrese 2"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Calabrese, E.

The Nobel Prize, in the wake of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], focused public attention on a subject Muller had been publicizing for two decades - the dangers of radiation. In 1952, [[nuclear fallout]] became a public issue; since [[Operation Crossroads]], more and more evidence had been leaking out about [[radiation sickness]] and death caused by [[nuclear testing]]. Muller and many other scientists pursued an array of political activities to defuse the threat of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. With the [[Castle Bravo]] fallout controversy in 1954, the issue became even more urgent.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} In 1955, Muller was one of 11 prominent intellectuals to sign the [[Russell-Einstein Manifesto]], the upshot of which was the first [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs|1957 Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs]], which addressed the control of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name="jf"&gt;John Bellamy Foster (2009). ''The Ecological Revolution: Making Peace with the Planet'', Monthly Review Press, New York, pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp. 336–379.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a signatory (with many other scientists) of the 1958 petition to the United Nations, calling for an end to nuclear weapons testing, which was initiated by the Nobel Prize-winning chemist [[Linus Pauling]].&lt;ref name="jf"/&gt;

Muller's opinions on the effect of radiation on mutagenesis, however, had been criticized by some scientists; geneticist [[James F. Crow]] called Muller's view "alarmist" and wrote that it created in the public "an irrational fear of low-level radiation relative to other risks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Muller, Dobzhansky, and Overdominance|author=James F.

Muller was awarded the [[Linnean Society of London]]'s [[Darwin-Wallace Medal]] in 1958 and the Kimber Genetics Award of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasonline.org/programs/awards/kimber-genetics-award.html |title=Kimber Genetics Award |work=National Academy of Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as president of the American Humanist Association from 1956 to 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://americanhumanist.org/about/past-aha-presidents/ |title=Past AHA Presidents |work=American Humanist Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Mathematical Society]] selected him as its Gibbs Lecturer for 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Muller, H.

H. J. Muller and science-fiction writer [[Ursula Le Guin]] were [[second cousins]]; his father (Hermann J. Muller Sr.) and her father's mother (Johanna Muller Kroeber) were siblings, the children of Nicholas Müller, who immigrated to the United States in 1848, and at that time dropped the umlaut from his name. Another cousin was [[Herbert J. Muller]], whose grandfather Otto was another son of Nicholas and a sibling of Hermann Sr. and Johanna.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Muller is survived by his daughter, Helen J. Muller, now a professor emerita at the [[University of New Mexico]], who has a daughter, Mala Htun. His son, [[David E. Muller]], a professor emeritus of mathematics and computer science at the [[University of Illinois]] and at [[New Mexico State University]], died in 2008 in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. David's mother was Jessie Jacobs Muller Offermann, Hermann's first wife. Helen's mother was Dorothea Kantorowicz Muller, Hermann's second wife.&lt;ref name="nas biography"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/muller-hermann.pdf |title= Hermann Joseph Muller 1890—1967 | author=Elof Axel Carlson |work=National Academy of Sciences |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1930–1950 ==

=== RNA and DNA have distinct chemical properties===
When first studied in the early 1900s, the chemical and biological differences between RNA and DNA were not apparent, and they were named after the materials from which they were isolated; RNA was initially known as "[[yeast]] nucleic acid" and DNA was "[[thymus]] nucleic acid".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803104532550 "Thymus Nucleic Acid"], ''[[Oxford Reference]]''. Retrieved on 21 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Using diagnostic chemical tests, [[carbohydrate]] chemists showed that the two nucleic acids contained different [[sugars]], whereupon the common name for RNA became "ribose nucleic acid". Other early biochemical studies showed that RNA was readily broken down at high [[pH]], while DNA was stable (although denatured) in [[alkali]]. Nucleoside composition analysis showed first that RNA contained similar [[nucleobase]]s to DNA, with [[uracil]] instead of [[thymine]], and that RNA contained a number of minor nucleobase components, e.g. small amounts of [[pseudouridine]] and [[dimethylguanine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = FW. | year = 1941 | title = The Biochemistry of the Nucleic Acids, Purines, and Pyrimidines | url = | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 221–244 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.10.070141.001253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Localization in cell and morphogenetic role ===
In 1933, while studying virgin [[sea urchin]] eggs, [[Jean Brachet]] suggested that [[DNA]] is found in [[cell nucleus]] and that [[RNA]] is present exclusively in the [[cytoplasm]]. At the time, "yeast nucleic acid" (RNA) was thought to occur only in plants, while "thymus nucleic acid" (DNA) only in animals. The latter was thought to be a tetramer, with the function of buffering cellular pH.&lt;ref&gt;Brachet, J. (1933).

[http://www.histcnrs.fr/ColloqDijon/Burian-Brachet.pdf link].&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, [[Joachim Hämmerling]] conducted experiments with ''[[Acetabularia]]'' in which he began to distinguish the contributions of the nucleus and the cytoplasm substances (later discovered to be DNA and mRNA, respectively) to cell morphogenesis and development.&lt;ref&gt;Hämmerling, J.

=== Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries genetic information that directs protein synthesis===
The concept of messenger RNA emerged during the late 1950s, and is associated with [[Francis Crick|Crick]]'s description of his "Central Dogma of Molecular Biology", which asserted that DNA led to the formation of RNA, which in turn led to the synthesis of [[protein]]s. During the early 1960s, sophisticated genetic analysis of mutations in the [[lac operon]] of [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] and in the rII locus of [[Enterobacteria phage T4|bacteriophage T4]] were instrumental in defining the nature of both [[messenger RNA]] and the [[genetic code]]. The short-lived nature of bacterial RNAs, together with the highly complex nature of the cellular mRNA population, made the biochemical isolation of mRNA very challenging. This problem was overcome in the 1960s by the use of [[reticulocyte]]s in vertebrates,&lt;ref name="pmid16590302"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schweet R, Lamfrom H, Allen E |title=THE SYNTHESIS OF HEMOGLOBIN IN A CELL-FREE SYSTEM |journal=Proc.

=== Ribosomes make proteins===
In the 1950s, results of labeling experiments in rat liver showed that radioactive [[amino acid]]s were found to be associated with "microsomes" (later redefined as [[ribosomes]]) very rapidly after administration, and before they became widely incorporated into cellular proteins. Ribosomes were first visualized using [[electron microscopy]], and their ribonucleoprotein components were identified by biophysical methods, chiefly sedimentation analysis within [[ultracentrifuges]] capable of generating very high accelerations (equivalent to hundreds of thousands times gravity). [[Polysomes]] (multiple ribosomes moving along a single mRNA molecule) were identified in the early 1960s, and their study led to an understanding of how ribosomes proceed to read the mRNA in a 5' to 3' direction,&lt;ref name="pmid5339691"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lamfrom H, McLaughlin CS, Sarabhai A |title=Direction of reading the genetic message in reticulocytes |journal=J. Mol.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transfer RNA (tRNA) is the physical link between RNA and protein===
Biochemical fractionation experiments showed that radioactive amino acids were rapidly incorporated into small RNA molecules that remained soluble under conditions where larger RNA-containing particles would precipitate. These molecules were termed soluble (sRNA) and were later renamed transfer RNA ([[tRNA]]). Subsequent studies showed that (i) every cell has multiple species of tRNA, each of which is associated with a single specific amino acid, (ii) that there are a matching set of [[enzyme]]s responsible for linking tRNAs with the correct amino acids, and (iii) that tRNA [[anticodon]] sequences form a specific decoding interaction with mRNA [[codons]].&lt;ref name="pmid|60910"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The genetic code is solved===
The [[genetic code]] consists of the translation of particular [[nucleotide sequence]]s in mRNA to specific amino acid sequences in [[proteins]] (polypeptides). The ability to work out the genetic code emerged from the convergence of three different areas of study--(i) new methods to generate synthetic RNA molecules of defined composition to serve as artificial mRNAs, (ii) development of ''in vitro'' translation systems that could be used to translate the synthetic mRNAs into protein, and (iii) experimental and theoretical genetic work which established that the code was written in three letter "words" ([[codons]]). Today, our understanding of the genetic code permits the prediction of the amino sequence of the protein products of the tens of thousands of genes whose sequences are being determined in [[Genome research|genome studies]].&lt;ref name="pmid|5322508"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RNA polymerase is purified===
The biochemical purification and characterization of [[RNA polymerase]] from the bacterium [[Escherichia coli]] enabled the understanding of the mechanisms through which RNA polymerase initiates and terminates [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], and how those processes are regulated to regulate [[gene expression]] (i.e. turn genes on and off). Following the isolation of E. coli RNA polymerase, the three RNA polymerases of the eukaryotic nucleus were identified, as well as those associated with viruses and organelles. Studies of transcription also led to the identification of many protein factors that influence transcription, including repressors, activators and enhancers.  The availability of purified preparations of RNA polymerase permitted investigators to develop a wide range of novel methods for studying RNA in the test tube, and led directly to many of the subsequent key discoveries in RNA biology.&lt;ref name="pmid|5001045"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== First complete nucleotide sequence of a biological nucleic acid molecule===
Although determining the sequence of proteins was becoming somewhat routine, methods for sequencing of nucleic acids were not available until the mid-1960s. In this seminal work, a specific tRNA was purified in substantial quantities, and then sliced into overlapping fragments using a variety of ribonucleases. Analysis of the detailed nucleotide composition of each fragment provided the information necessary to deduce the sequence of the tRNA. Today, the sequence analysis of much larger nucleic acid molecules is highly automated and enormously faster.&lt;ref name="pmid|4875713"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolutionary variation of homologous RNA sequences reveals folding patterns===
Additional tRNA molecules were purified and sequenced. The first comparative sequence analysis was done and revealed that the sequences varied through evolution in such a way that all of the tRNAs could fold into very similar secondary structures (two-dimensional structures) and had identical sequences at numerous positions (e.g. CCA at the 3' end). The radial four-arm structure of tRNA molecules is termed the 'cloverleaf structure', and results from the evolution of sequences with common ancestry and common biological function. Since the discovery of the tRNA cloverleaf, comparative analysis of numerous other homologous RNA molecules has led to the identification of common sequences and folding patterns.&lt;ref name="pmid|6163215"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Noller HF, Woese CR |title=Secondary structure of 16S ribosomal RNA |journal=Science |volume=212 |issue=4493 |pages=403–11 |date=April 1981 |pmid=6163215 |doi= 10.1126/science.6163215|url=|bibcode = 1981Sci...212..403N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First complete genomic nucleotide sequence===
The 3569 nucleotide sequence of all of the genes of the RNA [[bacteriophage]] [[MS2 phage|MS2]] was determined by a large team of researchers over several years, and was reported in a series of scientific papers. These results enabled the analysis of the first complete genome, albeit an extremely tiny one by modern standards. Several surprising features were identified, including genes that partially overlap one another and the first clues that different organisms might have slightly different codon usage patterns.&lt;ref name="pmid|1264203"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Reverse transcriptase can copy RNA into DNA===
Retroviruses were shown to have a single-stranded RNA genome and to replicate via a DNA intermediate, the reverse of the usual DNA-to-RNA transcription pathway. They encode a RNA-dependent DNA polymerase ([[reverse transcriptase]]) that is essential for this process. Some retroviruses can cause diseases, including several that are associated with cancer, and HIV-1 which causes AIDS. Reverse transcriptase has been widely used as an experimental tool for the analysis of RNA molecules in the laboratory, in particular the conversion of RNA molecules into DNA prior to [[molecular cloning]] and/or [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR).&lt;ref name="pmid|9759480"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RNA replicons evolve rapidly===
Biochemical and genetic analyses showed that the enzyme systems that replicate viral RNA molecules (reverse transcriptases and RNA replicases) lack molecular proofreading (3' to 5' exonuclease) activity, and that RNA sequences do not benefit from extensive repair systems analogous to those that exist for maintaining and repairing DNA sequences. Consequently, RNA genomes appear to be subject to significantly higher mutation rates than DNA genomes. For example, mutations in HIV-1 that lead to the emergence of viral mutants that are insensitive to antiviral drugs are common, and constitute a major clinical challenge.&lt;ref name="pmid|20949639"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Savolainen-Kopra C, Blomqvist S |title=Mechanisms of genetic variation in polioviruses |journal=Rev.

=== Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences provide a record of the evolutionary history of all life forms===
Analysis of [[ribosomal RNA]] sequences from a large number of organisms demonstrated that all extant forms of life on Earth share common structural and sequence features of the ribosomal RNA, reflecting a [[Last common ancestor|common ancestry]]. Mapping the similarities and differences among rRNA molecules from different sources provides clear and quantitative information about the [[phylogenetic]] (i.e. evolutionary) relationships among organisms. Analysis of rRNA molecules led to the identification of a third major kingdom of organisms, the [[archaea]], in addition to the [[prokaryotes]] and [[eukaryotes]].&lt;ref name="pmid|10900003"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Non-encoded nucleotides are added to the ends of RNA molecules===
Molecular analysis of mRNA molecules showed that, following transcription, mRNAs have non-DNA-encoded nucleotides added to both their 5' and 3' ends (guanosine caps and poly-A, respectively). Enzymes were also identified that add and maintain the universal CCA sequence on the 3' end of tRNA molecules. These events are among the first discovered examples of [[RNA processing]], a complex series of reactions that are needed to convert RNA primary transcripts into biologically active RNA molecules.&lt;ref name="pmid|1353951"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Small RNA molecules are abundant in the eukaryotic nucleus===
[[Small nuclear RNA]] molecules (snRNAs) were identified in the eukaryotic [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] using immunological studies with autoimmune [[antibodies]], which bind to [[SnRNP|small nuclear ribonucleoprotein]] complexes (snRNPs; complexes of the snRNA and protein). Subsequent biochemical, genetic, and phylogenetic studies established that many of these molecules play key roles in essential [[RNA processing]] reactions within the nucleus and [[nucleolus]], including [[RNA splicing]], [[polyadenylation]], and the maturation of [[ribosomal RNA]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid|6180681"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== RNA molecules require a specific, complex three-dimensional structure for activity===
The detailed three-dimensional structure of [[tRNA]] molecules was determined using [[X-ray crystallography]], and revealed highly complex, compact three dimensional structures consisting of tertiary interactions laid upon the basic cloverleaf secondary structure. Key features of tRNA tertiary structure include the coaxial stacking of adjacent helices and non-Watson-Crick interactions among nucleotides within the apical loops. Additional crystallographic studies showed that a wide range of RNA molecules (including [[ribozymes]], [[riboswitches]] and [[ribosomal RNA]]) also fold into specific structures containing a variety of 3D structural motifs. The ability of RNA molecules to adopt specific tertiary structures is essential for their biological activity, and results from the single-stranded nature of RNA. In many ways, RNA folding is more highly analogous to the folding of proteins rather than to the highly repetitive folded structure of the DNA double helix.&lt;ref name="pmid|60910" /&gt;

=== Genes are commonly interrupted by introns that must be removed by RNA splicing===
Analysis of mature eukaryotic [[messenger RNA]] molecules showed that they are often much smaller than the DNA sequences that encode them. The genes were shown to be discontinuous, composed of sequences that are not present in the final mature RNA ([[introns]]), located between sequences that are retained in the mature RNA ([[exons]]). Introns were shown to be removed after transcription through a process termed [[RNA splicing]]. Splicing of RNA transcripts requires a highly precise and coordinated sequence of molecular events, consisting of (a) definition of boundaries between exons and introns, (b) RNA strand cleavage at exactly those sites, and (c) covalent linking (ligation) of the RNA exons in the correct order. The discovery of discontinuous genes and RNA splicing was entirely unexpected by the community of RNA biologists, and stands as one of the most shocking findings in molecular biology research.&lt;ref name="pmid|2880558"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Alternative pre-mRNA splicing generates multiple proteins from a single gene===
The great majority of protein-coding genes encoded within the nucleus of [[metazoan]] cells contain multiple [[introns]]. In many cases, these introns were shown to be processed in more than one pattern, thus generating a family of related mRNAs that differ, for example, by the inclusion or exclusion of particular exons. The end result of [[alternative splicing]] is that a single [[gene]] can encode a number of different protein [[isoforms]] that can exhibit a variety of (usually related) biological functions. Indeed, most of the proteins encoded by the human genome are generated by alternative splicing.&lt;ref name="pmid|3304142"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Discovery of catalytic RNA (ribozymes)===
An experimental system was developed in which an intron-containing rRNA precursor from the nucleus of the ciliated protozoan [[Tetrahymena]] could be spliced ''[[in vitro]]''. Subsequent biochemical analysis shows that this [[group I intron]] was self-splicing; that is, the precursor RNA is capable of carrying out the complete splicing reaction in the absence of proteins. In separate work, the RNA component of the bacterial enzyme [[ribonuclease P]] (a [[ribonucleoprotein]] complex) was shown to catalyze its tRNA-processing reaction in the absence of proteins. These experiments represented landmarks in RNA biology, since they revealed that RNA could play an active role in cellular processes, by catalyzing specific biochemical reactions. Before these discoveries, it was believed that biological catalysis was solely the realm of [[protein]] [[enzymes]].&lt;ref name="pmid|2197983"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== RNA was likely critical for prebiotic evolution===
The discovery of catalytic RNA ([[ribozymes]]) showed that RNA could both encode genetic information (like DNA) and catalyze specific biochemical reactions (like protein [[enzymes]]). This realization led to the [[RNA World Hypothesis]], a proposal that RNA may have played a critical role in [[prebiotic evolution]] at a time before the molecules with more specialized functions (DNA and proteins) came to dominate biological information coding and catalysis. Although it is not possible for us to know the course of prebiotic evolution with any certainty, the presence of functional RNA molecules with common ancestry in all modern-day life forms is a strong argument that RNA was widely present at the time of the [[last common ancestor]].&lt;ref name="pmid|2466202"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Introns can be mobile genetic elements===
Some self-splicing introns can spread through a population of organisms by "homing", inserting copies of themselves into genes at sites that previously lacked an intron. Because they are self-splicing (that is, they remove themselves at the RNA level from genes into which they have inserted), these sequences represent [[transposons]] that are genetically silent, i.e. they do not interfere with the expression of the gene into which they become inserted. These introns can be regarded as examples of [[selfish DNA]]. Some mobile introns encode [[homing endonucleases]], enzymes that initiate the homing process by specifically cleaving double-stranded DNA at or near the intron-insertion site of alleles lacking an intron. Mobile introns are frequently members of either the [[Group I intron|group I]] or [[Group II intron|group II]] families of self-splicing introns.&lt;ref name="pmid|8352597"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spliceosomes mediate nuclear pre-mRNA splicing===
Introns are removed from nuclear pre-mRNAs by [[spliceosome]]s, large [[ribonucleoprotein]] complexes made up of [[snRNA]] and protein molecules whose composition and molecular interactions change during the course of the [[RNA splicing]] reactions. Spliceosomes assemble on and around splice sites (the boundaries between introns and exons in the unspliced pre-mRNA) in mRNA precursors and use RNA-RNA interactions to identify critical nucleotide sequences and, probably, to catalyze the splicing reactions. Nuclear pre-mRNA introns and spliceosome-associated snRNAs show similar structural features to self-splicing group II introns. In addition, the splicing pathway of nuclear pre-mRNA introns and group II introns shares a similar reaction pathway. These similarities have led to the hypothesis that these molecules may share a common ancestor.&lt;ref name="pmid|8811184"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== RNA sequences can be edited within cells===
Messenger RNA precursors from a wide range of organisms can be [[RNA editing|edited]] before being translated into protein. In this process, non-encoded nucleotides may be inserted into specific sites in the RNA, and encoded nucleotides may be removed or replaced. [[RNA editing]] was first discovered within the mitochondria of [[Kinetoplastida|kinetoplastid]] protozoans, where it has been shown to be extensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simpson L, Shaw J |title=RNA editing and the mitochondrial cryptogenes of kinetoplastid [[protists]] |journal=Cell |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=355–66 |date=May 1989 |pmid=2470509 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(89)90911-2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some protein-coding genes encode fewer than 50% of the nucleotides found within the mature, translated mRNA. Other RNA editing events are found in mammals, plants, bacteria and viruses. These latter editing events involve fewer nucleotide modifications, insertions and deletions than the events within [[kinetoplast]] DNA, but still have high biological significance for gene expression and its regulation.&lt;ref name="pmid|11092837"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Telomerase uses a built-in RNA template to maintain chromosome ends===
Telomerase is an enzyme that is present in all eukaryotic nuclei which serves to maintain the ends of the linear DNA in the linear [[chromosomes]] of the eukaryotic nucleus, through the addition of terminal sequences that are lost in each round of DNA replication.  Before telomerase was identified, its activity was predicted on the basis of a molecular understanding of DNA replication, which indicated that the DNA polymerases known at that time could not replicate the 3' end of a linear chromosome, due to the absence of a template strand. Telomerase was shown to be a [[ribonucleoprotein]] enzyme that contains an RNA component that serves as a [[template strand]], and a protein component that has [[reverse transcriptase]] activity and adds nucleotides to the chromosome ends using the internal RNA template.&lt;ref name="pmid|16756500"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Ribosomal RNA catalyzes peptide bond formation===
For years, scientists had worked to identify which protein(s) within the [[ribosome]] were responsible for [[peptidyl transferase]] function during [[Translation (biology)|translation]], because the covalent linking of amino acids represents one of the most central chemical reactions in all of biology. Careful biochemical studies showed that extensively-deproteinized large ribosomal subunits could still catalyze peptide bond formation, thereby implying that the sought-after activity might lie within ribosomal RNA rather than ribosomal proteins. Structural biologists, using [[X-ray crystallography]], localized the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome to a highly-[[Conserved sequence|conserved]] region of the large subunit [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) that is located at the place within the ribosome where the amino-acid-bearing ends of tRNA bind, and where no proteins are present. These studies led to the conclusion that the [[ribosome]] is a [[ribozyme]]. The rRNA sequences that make up the ribosomal [[active site]] represent some of the most highly conserved sequences in the biological world. Together, these observations indicate that peptide bond formation catalyzed by RNA was a feature of the [[last universal ancestor|last common ancestor]] of all known forms of life.&lt;ref name="pmid|1604315"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Combinatorial selection of RNA molecules enables in vitro evolution===
Experimental methods were invented that allowed investigators to use large, diverse populations of RNA molecules to carry out in vitro molecular experiments that utilized powerful selective replication strategies used by geneticists, and which amount to evolution in the test tube. These experiments have been described using different names, the most common of which are "combinatorial selection", "in vitro selection", and SELEX (for [[Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment]]). These experiments have been used for isolating RNA molecules with a wide range of properties, from binding to particular proteins, to catalyzing particular reactions, to binding low molecular weight organic ligands. They have equal applicability to elucidating interactions and mechanisms that are known properties of naturally occurring RNA molecules to isolating RNA molecules with biochemical properties that are not known in nature. In developing in vitro selection technology for RNA, laboratory systems for synthesizing complex populations of RNA molecules were established, and used in conjunction with the selection of molecules with user-specified biochemical activities, and in vitro schemes for RNA replication. These steps can be viewed as (a) [[mutation]], (b) selection, and (c) [[Self-replication|replication]]. Together, then, these three processes enable in vitro [[molecular evolution]].&lt;ref name="pmid|11539574"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Many mobile DNA elements use an RNA intermediate===
[[Transposon|Transposable genetic elements]] (transposons) are found which can replicate via transcription into an [[Retrotransposon|RNA intermediate]] which is subsequently converted to DNA by reverse transcriptase. These sequences, many of which are likely related to retroviruses, constitute much of the DNA of the eukaryotic nucleus, especially so in plants. Genomic sequencing shows that retrotransposons make up 36% of the human genome and over half of the genome of major cereal crops (wheat and maize).&lt;ref name="pmid|18680436"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Riboswitches bind cellular metabolites and control gene expression===
Segments of RNA, typically embedded within the 5'-untranslated region of a vast number of bacterial mRNA molecules, have a profound effect on gene expression through a previously-undiscovered mechanism that does not involve the participation of proteins. In many cases, [[riboswitch]]es change their folded structure in response to environmental conditions (e.g. ambient temperature or concentrations of specific metabolites), and the structural change controls the translation or stability of the mRNA in which the riboswitch is embedded. In this way, gene expression can be dramatically regulated at the post-transcriptional level.&lt;ref name="pmid|19298181"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Small RNA molecules regulate gene expression by post-transcriptional gene silencing===
Another previously unknown mechanism by which RNA molecules are involved in genetic regulation was discovered in the 1990s. Small RNA molecules termed microRNA (miRNA) and [[RNA interference|small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) are abundant in eukaryotic cells and exert post-transcriptional control over mRNA expression. They function by binding to specific sites within the mRNA and inducing cleavage of the mRNA via a specific silencing-associated RNA degradation pathway.&lt;ref name="pmid|19239886"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Noncoding RNA controls epigenetic phenomena===
In addition to their well-established roles in translation and splicing, members of [[noncoding RNA]] (ncRNA) families have recently been found to function in genome defense and chromosome inactivation. For example, [[piwi-interacting RNA]]s (piRNAs) prevent genome instability in germ line cells, while Xist (X-inactive-specific-transcript) is essential for X-chromosome inactivation in mammals.&lt;ref name="pmid|21030644"&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Hospitality management''' is the study of the [[hospitality industry]]. A degree in the subject may be awarded either by a university college dedicated to the studies of  hospitality management or a [[business school]] with a relevant department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=What is Hospitality management?|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-hospitality-management.htm|journal=http://www.wisegeek.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://srihm.edu.in/ Degrees in hospitality management] may also be referred to as [[Hotel manager|hotel management]], hotel and tourism management, or hotel administration. Degrees conferred in this academic field include [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], [[Bachelor of Business Administration]], [[Bachelor of Science|BS]], [[Bachelor of Applied Science|BASc]], [[Master of Science|MS]], [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]. Hospitality management covers [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[cruise ship]]s, [[amusement parks]], [[destination marketing organization]]s, [[convention center]]s, and [[country club]]s.

==Curriculum==
In the USA, hospitality and tourism management curricula follow similar core subject applications to that of a [[business degree]], but with a focus on tourism development and hospitality management. Core subject areas include [[accounting]], [[administration (business)|administration]], [[finance]], [[information systems]], [[marketing]], [[human resource management]], [[public relations]], [[business strategy|strategy]], [[quantitative methods]], and sectoral studies in the various areas of hospitality business.

===Vegetarian option===
In 2016, Ministry of Tourism, [[Government of India]] started giving hospitality management students the option to choose only vegetarian cooking. This was introduced at three of the institutes (IHMCTAN Ahmedabad, IHMCTAN Bhopal and IHMCTAN Jaipur) affiliated with the Ministry. This decision to offer a vegetarian option by IHMCTANs may be the first amongst any of the hospitality training institutes of the world. It is expected that all IHMCTANs in India will start offering a vegetarian cooking option from academic year 2018 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/Article.aspx?eid=31808&amp;articlexml=IHMs-to-offer-3-yr-course-in-vegetarian-11072016013026|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofjaipur.com/news/2016/07/13/vegetarian-cooking-courses-to-be-introduced-in-hotel-management-institutes/|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nchmcounselling.nic.in/nchminfo/Public/View.aspx?page=79 |title=NCHM Counselling 2018 |publisher=Nchmcounselling.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rankings of degree-granting programs ==
These top ten lists are specific to departments that specifically give degrees in the hospitality field itself.  For the more general type of degree, see the [[list of business schools in the United States]], and similar articles for other countries.  For restaurant-related hospitality industry degrees in nutrition, see list of universities with accredited dietetic programs.  For overall rankings of universities by various metrics, see [[college and university rankings|&lt;span dir="ltr" lang="ace"&gt;college&lt;/span&gt; and university rankings]].

=== Opinion surveys of employers in the hospitality industry ===
In a broad industry survey of senior managers from luxury hotels in 2013, conducted a [[market survey]] of hospitality employers regarding their opinions of the top ten hospitality management schools.   Laureate Hospitality Education, a division of Laureate Education Inc, commissioned TNS to conduct each of these surveys, and 2 schools out of 10 (numbers 6, 8) belong to Laureate Hospitality Education.
The result appeared as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Hospitality Management Schools: 2013 Worldwide Industry Ranking Survey |url= http://www.glion.edu/glion_education/en/en-en/file.cfm/document/tns_white_paper_2013_-_international.pdf?contentid=6276 |publisher=http://www.glion.edu |date=October 2013|accessdate=2014-08-2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="242069">'''Induced stem cells''' ('''iSC''') are [[stem cells]] derived from [[Somatic cell|somatic]], [[Reproductive cells|reproductive]], [[Cell potency|pluripotent]] or other cell types by deliberate [[epigenetic]] reprogramming. They are classified as either [[totipotency|totipotent]] (iTC), [[Induced pluripotent stem cells|pluripotent]] (iPSC) or [[Progenitor cells|progenitor]] (multipotent – iMSC, also called an induced multipotent progenitor cell – iMPC) or [[Unipotency|unipotent]] – (iUSC) according to their [[Cell potency|developmental potential and degree of dedifferentiation]]. Progenitors are obtained by so-called [[Induced stem cells#Induced progenitor stem cells|direct reprogramming]] or directed [[Transdifferentiation|differentiation]] and are also called induced [[Adult stem cell|somatic stem cells]].

One example is the transformation of [[iris (eye)|iris]] cells to [[lens (eye)|lens]] cells in the process of maturation and transformation of [[retinal pigment epithelium]] cells into the neural retina during regeneration in adult [[newt]] eyes. This process allows the body to replace cells not suitable to new conditions with more suitable new cells. In [[Drosophila]] imaginal discs, cells have to choose from a limited number of standard discrete differentiation states. The fact that transdetermination (change of the path of differentiation) often occurs for a group of cells rather than single cells shows that it is induced rather than part of maturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1634/stemcells.18-6-409| pmid = 11072028| title = Stem Cell Plasticity in Mammals and Transdetermination in ''Drosophila'': Common Themes?| journal = Stem Cells| volume = 18| issue = 6| pages = 409–14| year = 2000| last1 = Wei | first1 = G.| last2 = Schubiger | first2 = G.| last3 = Harder | first3 = F.| last4 = M&amp;uuml;ller | first4 = A.

The researchers were able to identify the minimal conditions and factors that would be sufficient for starting the cascade of molecular and cellular processes to instruct pluripotent cells to organize the [[embryo]]. They showed that [[Chemotaxis|opposing gradients]] of [[bone morphogenetic protein]] (BMP) and [[NODAL|Nodal]], two [[transforming growth factor]] family members that act as [[morphogen]]s, are sufficient to induce molecular and cellular mechanisms required to organize, ''[[in vivo]]'' or ''[[in vitro]]'', [[Cell fate determination|uncommitted cells]] of the [[zebrafish]] [[blastula]] animal pole into a well-developed [[embryo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = Peng-Fei | last2 = Houssin | first2 = Nathalie | last3 = Ferri-Lagneau | first3 = Karine F. | last4 = Thisse | first4 = Bernard | last5 = Thisse | first5 = Christine | year = 2014 | title = Construction of a Vertebrate Embryo from Two Opposing Morphogen Gradients | url = | journal = Science | volume = 344 | issue = 6179| pages = 87–89 | doi = 10.1126/science.1248252 | pmid=24700857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of mature, specialized adult cells can naturally revert to stem cells. For example, "chief" cells express the stem cell marker Troy. While they normally produce digestive fluids for the stomach, they can revert into stem cells to make temporary repairs to stomach injuries, such as a cut or damage from infection. Moreover, they can make this transition even in the absence of noticeable injuries and are capable of replenishing entire gastric units, in essence serving as quiescent "reserve" stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.008| title = Differentiated Troy+ Chief Cells Act as Reserve Stem Cells to Generate All Lineages of the Stomach Epithelium| journal = Cell| volume = 155| issue = 2| pages = 357–68| year = 2013| last1 = Stange | first1 = D.

Induced totipotent cells can be obtained by reprogramming somatic cells with [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] (SCNT).

Totipotent cells were obtained using the epigenetic factors such as oocyte germinal isoform of histone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2013.12.015| pmid = 24506885| title = Histone Variants Enriched in Oocytes Enhance Reprogramming to Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells| journal = Cell Stem Cell| volume = 14| issue = 2| pages = 217–227| year = 2014| last1 = Shinagawa | first1 = T. | last2 = Takagi | first2 = T. | last3 = Tsukamoto | first3 = D. | last4 = Tomaru | first4 = C. | last5 = Huynh | first5 = L.

In August 2006, Japanese researchers circumvented the need for an oocyte, as in SCNT. By reprograming mouse embryonic [[fibroblast]]s into pluripotent stem cells via the ectopic expression of four [[transcription factor]]s, namely [[Oct4]], [[Sox2]], [[Klf4]] and [[c-Myc]], they proved that the overexpression of a small number of factors can push the cell to transition to a new stable state that is associated with changes in the activity of thousands of genes.&lt;ref name="Takahashi"/&gt;
[[File:Overview of iPS cells.png|thumb|Human somatic cells are made pluripotent by transducing them with factors that induces pluripotency (OCT 3/4, SOX2, Klf4, c-Myc, NANOG and LIN28).

A small molecule called MitoBloCK-6 can force the pluripotent stem cells to die by triggering [[apoptosis]] (via [[cytochrome c]] release across the [[mitochondria]]l outer membrane) in human pluripotent stem cells, but not in differentiated cells. Shortly after differentiation, daughter cells became resistant to death. When MitoBloCK-6 was introduced to differentiated cell lines, the cells remained healthy. The key to their survival, was hypothesized to be due to the changes undergone by pluripotent stem cell mitochondria in the process of cell differentiation. This ability of MitoBloCK-6 to separate the pluripotent and differentiated cell lines has the potential to reduce the risk of teratomas and other problems in regenerative medicine.&lt;ref name="Dabir"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.devcel.2013.03.006| pmid = 23597483| pmc = 3726224| title = A Small Molecule Inhibitor of Redox-Regulated Protein Translocation into Mitochondria| journal = Developmental Cell| volume = 25| issue = 1| pages = 81–92| year = 2013| last1 = Dabir | first1 = D.

The most potent and selective compound of them (PluriSIn #1) inhibits [[Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1|stearoyl-coA desaturase]] (the key enzyme in [[oleic acid]] biosynthesis), which finally results in apoptosis.

Teratoma formation by pluripotent stem cells may be caused by low activity of [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN enzyme]], reported to promote the survival of a small population (0.1–5% of total population) of highly tumorigenic, aggressive, teratoma-initiating embryonic-like carcinoma cells during differentiation.

=== Chemical inducement ===
{{main article|Chemical biology#Chemical approaches to stem-cell biology}}
By using solely [[small molecules]], Deng Hongkui and colleagues demonstrated that endogenous "master genes" are enough for cell fate reprogramming. They induced a pluripotent state in adult cells from mice using seven small-molecule compounds.&lt;ref name="Hongkui Deng"/&gt;
The effectiveness of the method is quite high: it was able to convert 0.02% of the adult tissue cells into iPSCs, which is comparable to the gene insertion conversion rate.
The authors note that the mice generated from CiPSCs were "100% viable and apparently healthy for up to 6 months". So, this chemical reprogramming strategy has potential use in generating functional desirable cell types for clinical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Los | first1 = Angeles | last2 = Daley | first2 = G.

=== Differentiation from induced teratoma ===

The fact that human iPSCs capable of forming teratomas not only in humans but also in some animal body, in particular in mice or pigs, allowed to develop a method for differentiation of iPSCs in vivo. For this purpose, iPSCs with an agent for inducing differentiation into target cells are injected to [[Genetically modified mammal|genetically modified]] pig or mouse that has suppressed immune system activation on human cells.
The formed teratoma is cut out and used for the isolation of the necessary differentiated human cells&lt;ref&gt;Nakauchi Hiromitsu; Kamiya Akihide; Suzuki Nao; Ito Keiichi; Yamazaki Satoshi (2011) [http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=WO&amp;NR=2011071085&amp;KC=&amp;FT=E&amp;locale=en_EP   Method for Producing Cells Induced to Differentiate from Pluripotent Stem Cells.] Patent Cooperation Treaty Application, patno: WO2011071085  (A1). 2011-06-16 (C12N5/07)&lt;/ref&gt; by means of [[monoclonal antibody]] to tissue-specific markers on the surface of these cells. This method has been successfully used for the production of functional myeloid, erythroid and lymphoid human cells suitable for transplantation (yet only to mice).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1182/blood-2012-06-434407| pmid = 23212524| title = In vivo generation of transplantable human hematopoietic cells from induced pluripotent stem cells| journal = Blood| volume = 121| issue = 8| pages = 1255–1264| year = 2012| last1 = Amabile | first1 = G.| last2 = Welner | first2 = R.

Mice engrafted with human iPSC teratoma-derived hematopoietic cells produced human B and T cells capable of functional immune responses. These results offer hope that in vivo generation of patient customized cells is feasible, providing materials that could be useful for transplantation, human antibody generation and drug screening applications.
Using MitoBloCK-6&lt;ref name="Dabir"/&gt; and/or PluriSIn # 1 the differentiated progenitor cells can be further purified from teratoma forming pluripotent cells. The fact, that the differentiation takes place even in the teratoma niche, offers hope that the resulting cells are sufficiently stable to stimuli able to cause their transition back to the dedifferentiated (pluripotent) state and therefore safe. A similar in vivo differentiation system, yielding engraftable hematopoietic stem cells from mouse and human iPSCs in teratoma-bearing animals in combination with a maneuver to facilitate hematopoiesis, was described by Suzuki et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/mt.2013.71| pmid = 23670574| title = Generation of Engraftable Hematopoietic Stem Cells from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells by Way of Teratoma Formation| journal = Molecular Therapy| volume = 21| issue = 7| pages = 1424–1431| year = 2013| last1 = Suzuki | first1 = N. | last2 = Yamazaki | first2 = S. | last3 = Yamaguchi | first3 = T. | last4 = Okabe | first4 = M. | last5 = Masaki | first5 = H. | last6 = Takaki | first6 = S. | last7 = Otsu | first7 = M. | last8 = Nakauchi | first8 = H. | pmc=3705943}}&lt;/ref&gt; They noted that neither leukemia nor tumors were observed in recipients after intravenous injection of iPSC-derived hematopoietic stem cells into irradiated recipients. Moreover, this injection resulted in multilineage and long-term reconstitution of the hematolymphopoietic system in serial transfers. Such system provides a useful tool for practical application of iPSCs in the treatment of hematologic and immunologic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/mt.2013.129| pmid = 23812546| title = Generation and Homing of iPSC-Derived Hematopoietic Cells in Vivo| journal = Molecular Therapy| volume = 21| issue = 7| pages = 1292–1293| year = 2013| last1 = Chou | first1 = B.

==== Single transcription factor transdifferentiation ====

Originally only early embryonic cells could be coaxed into changing their identity. Mature cells are resistant to changing their identity once they've committed to a specific kind. However, brief expression of a single transcription factor, the ELT-7 GATA factor, can convert the identity of fully differentiated, specialized non-endodermal cells of the [[pharynx]] into fully differentiated intestinal cells in intact [[larvae]] and adult roundworm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' with no requirement for a dedifferentiated intermediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1242/dev.103010| pmid = 24257624| title = Transdifferentiation and remodeling of post-embryonic C.

==== Transdifferentiation with CRISPR-mediated activator ====

The cell fate can be effectively manipulated by [[epigenome editing]]. In particular, by directly activating of specific endogenous gene expression with [[CRISPR]]-mediated activator. When [[Cas9#Applications of Cas9 to transcription tuning|dCas9]] (that has been modified so that it no longer cuts DNA, but still can be guided to specific sequences and to bind to them) is combined with transcription activators, it can precisely manipulate endogenous gene expression. Using this method, Wei et al., enhanced the expression of endogenous [[CDX2|Cdx2]] and [[GATA6|Gata6]] genes by CRISPR-mediated activators, thus directly converted mouse embryonic stem cells into two extraembryonic lineages, i.e., typical trophoblast stem cells and extraembryonic endoderm cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wei | first1 = S | last2 = Zou | first2 = Q | last3 = Lai | first3 = S | display-authors = etal   | year = 2016 | title = Conversion of embryonic stem cells into extraembryonic lineages by CRISPR-mediated activators | url = | journal = Sci.

The rapid and sustained activation of endogenous genes in their native chromatin context by this approach may facilitate reprogramming with transient methods that avoid genomic integration and provides a new strategy for overcoming epigenetic barriers to cell fate specification.

=== Phased process modeling regeneration ===

Another way of reprogramming is the simulation of the processes that occur during [[amphibian]] limb regeneration. In [[urodele]] amphibians, an early step in limb regeneration is skeletal muscle fiber dedifferentiation into a cellulate that proliferates into limb tissue. However, sequential small molecule treatment of the muscle fiber with myoseverin, [[reversine]] (the [[aurora B kinase]] inhibitor) and some other chemicals: BIO (glycogen synthase-3 kinase inhibitor), [[lysophosphatidic acid]] (pleiotropic activator of G-protein-coupled receptors), [[SB203580]] ([[p38 MAP kinase]] inhibitor), or [[SQ22536]] (adenylyl cyclase inhibitor) causes the formation of new muscle cell types as well as other cell types such as precursors to fat, bone and nervous system cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cb2000154| pmid = 21322636| title = Novel Chemically Defined Approach to Produce Multipotent Cells from Terminally Differentiated Tissue Syncytia| journal = ACS Chemical Biology| volume = 6| issue = 6| pages = 553–562| year = 2011| last1 = Jung | first1 = D.

This process occurs without the need for transduction of exogenous viral or cellular genes. These cells have been termed "Conditionally Reprogrammed Cells (CRC)". The induction of CRCs is rapid and results from reprogramming of the entire cell population. CRCs do not express high levels of proteins characteristic of iPSCs or embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (e.g., Sox2, Oct4, Nanog, or Klf4). This induction of CRCs is reversible and removal of Y-27632 and feeders allows the cells to differentiate normally.&lt;ref name="Xuefeng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandra"&gt;Sandra Chapman, Xuefeng Liu, Craig Meyers, Richard Schlegel, and Alison A.

In addition, the CRC method allows for the genetic manipulation of epithelial cells ex vivo and their subsequent evaluation in vivo in the same host. While initial studies revealed that co-culturing epithelial cells with Swiss 3T3 cells J2 was essential for CRC induction, with transwell culture plates, physical contact between feeders and epithelial cells is not required for inducing CRCs and more importantly that irradiation of the feeder cells is required for this induction. Consistent with the transwell experiments, conditioned medium induces and maintains CRCs, which is accompanied by a concomitant increase of cellular telomerase activity. The activity of the conditioned medium correlates directly with radiation-induced feeder cell apoptosis. Thus, conditional reprogramming of epithelial cells is mediated by a combination of Y-27632 and a soluble factor(s) released by apoptotic feeder cells.&lt;ref name="Nancy"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.08.009| pmid = 24096078| pmc = 5745544| title = Radiation Induces Diffusible Feeder Cell Factor(s) That Cooperate with ROCK Inhibitor to Conditionally Reprogram and Immortalize Epithelial Cells| journal = The American Journal of Pathology| volume = 183| issue = 6| pages = 1862–1870| year = 2013| last1 = Palechor-Ceron | first1 = N. | last2 = Suprynowicz | first2 = F.

Cell surface progenitor-associated markers are rapidly induced in normal mouse ME-CRCs relative to ME cells. However, the expression of certain mammary progenitor subpopulations, such as CD49f+ ESA+ CD44+, drops significantly in later passages. Nevertheless, mouse ME-CRCs grown in a three-dimensional extracellular matrix gave rise to mammary acinar structures. ME-CRCs isolated from MMTV-Neu transgenic mouse mammary tumors express high levels of HER2/neu, as well as tumor-initiating cell markers, such as CD44+, CD49f+ and ESA+ (EpCam). These patterns of expression are sustained in later CRC passages. Early and late passage ME-CRCs from MMTV-Neu tumors that were implanted in the mammary fat pads of syngeneic or nude mice developed vascular tumors that metastasized within 6 weeks of transplantation. Importantly, the histopathology of these tumors was indistinguishable from that of the parental tumors that develop in the MMTV-Neu mice. Application of the CRC system to mouse mammary epithelial cells provides an attractive model system to study the genetics and phenotype of normal and transformed mouse epithelium in a defined culture environment and in vivo transplant studies.

A different approach to CRC is to inhibit [[CD47]] – a [[membrane protein]] that is the [[thrombospondin-1]] receptor. Loss of CD47 permits sustained proliferation of primary [[murine]] endothelial cells, increases asymmetric division and enables these cells to spontaneously reprogram to form multipotent [[embryoid body]]-like clusters. CD47 knockdown acutely increases [[mRNA]] levels of c-Myc and other stem cell transcription factors in cells in vitro and in vivo. Thrombospondin-1 is a key environmental signal that inhibits stem cell self-renewal via CD47. Thus, CD47 antagonists enable cell self-renewal and reprogramming by overcoming negative regulation of c-Myc and other stem cell transcription factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaur | first1 = Sukhbir | last2 = Soto-Pantoja | first2 = David R. | last3 = Stein | first3 = Erica V. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013| title = Thrombospondin-1 Signaling through CD47 Inhibits Self-renewal by Regulating c-Myc and Other Stem Cell Transcription Factors | url = http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130417/srep01673/full/srep01673.html| journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 1673 | doi = 10.1038/srep01673 | pmid=23591719 | pmc=3628113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In vivo blockade of CD47 using an antisense [[morpholino]] increases survival of mice exposed to lethal total body irradiation due to increased proliferative capacity of bone marrow-derived cells and radioprotection of radiosensitive gastrointestinal tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/srep01038| title = Blockade of CD47 increases survival of mice exposed to lethal total body irradiation| journal = Scientific Reports| volume = 3| pages = 1038| year = 2013| last1 = Soto-Pantoja | first1 = D.

==== Lineage-specific enhancers ====
Differentiated [[macrophages]] can self-renew in tissues and expand long-term in culture.&lt;ref name="Maf"/&gt; Under certain conditions macrophages can divide without losing features they have acquired while specializing into [[immune cells]] – which is usually not possible with [[Cellular differentiation|differentiated cells]]. The macrophages achieve this by activating a [[Gene regulatory network|gene network]] similar to one found in embryonic stem cells. [[Single-cell analysis]] revealed that, ''in vivo'', proliferating macrophages can derepress a macrophage-specific enhancer repertoire associated with a gene network controlling self-renewal. This happened when concentrations of two transcription factors named [[MAFB (gene)|MafB]] and [[MAF (gene)|c-Maf]] were naturally low or were inhibited for a short time. Genetic manipulations that turned off MafB and c-Maf in the macrophages caused the cells to start a self-renewal program. The similar network also controls embryonic stem cell self-renewal but is associated with distinct embryonic stem cell-specific enhancers.&lt;ref name="Maflin"/&gt;

Hence macrophages isolated from MafB- and c-Maf-double deficient mice divide indefinitely; the self-renewal depends on [[Myc|c-Myc]] and [[KLF4|Klf4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gentek | first1 = R. | last2 = Molawi | first2 = K. | last3 = Sieweke | first3 = M.

=== Indirect lineage conversion ===

Indirect lineage conversion is a reprogramming methodology in which somatic cells transition through a plastic intermediate state of partially reprogrammed cells (pre-iPSC), induced by brief exposure to reprogramming factors, followed by differentiation in a specially developed chemical environment (artificial niche).&lt;ref name="Kurian"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kurian | first1 = Leo | last2 = Sancho-Martinez | first2 = Ignacio | last3 = Nivet | first3 = Emmanuel | last4 = Juan | last5 = Izpisua Belmonte | first5 = Carlos | year = 2012 | title = Conversion of human fibroblasts to angioblast-like progenitor cells | url = http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmeth.2255.html | journal = Nature Methods | volume =  10| issue = 1| pages =  77–83| doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2255 | pmid=23202434 | pmc=3531579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This method could be both more efficient and safer, since it does not seem to produce tumors or other undesirable genetic changes and results in much greater yield than other methods. However, the safety of these cells remains questionable. Since lineage conversion from pre-iPSC relies on the use of iPSC reprogramming conditions, a fraction of the cells could acquire pluripotent properties if they do not stop the de-differentation process in vitro or due to further de-differentiation in vivo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morris | first1 = S.

=== Outer membrane glycoprotein ===

A common feature of pluripotent stem cells is the specific nature of protein [[glycosylation]] of their outer membrane. That distinguishes them from most nonpluripotent cells, although not [[white blood cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/cr.2011.148| pmid = 21894191| title = Specific lectin biomarkers for isolation of human pluripotent stem cells identified through array-based glycomic analysis| journal = Cell Research| volume = 21| issue = 11| pages = 1551–1563| year = 2011| last1 = Wang | first1 = Y.

Furthermore, dedifferentiation of progenitor cells induced by ACA-dependent signaling pathway leads to ACA-induced pluripotent stem cells, capable of differentiating in vitro into cells of all three [[germ layers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Becker-Kojič | first1 = ZA | last2 = Ureña-Peralta | first2 = JR | last3 = Zipančić | first3 = I. | last4 = Stojkovič | first4 = M. | year = 2013 | title = Activation of surface glycoprotein ACA induced pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cells | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258062404 | format = PDF | journal = Cell Technologies in Biology and Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 85–101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cell adhesion protein]] [[CDH1 (gene)|E-cadherin]] is indispensable for a robust pluripotent [[phenotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/embor.2011.88| pmid = 21617704| title = E-cadherin is crucial for embryonic stem cell pluripotency and can replace OCT4 during somatic cell reprogramming| journal = EMBO Reports| volume = 12| issue = 7| pages = 720–726| year = 2011| last1 = Redmer | first1 = T. | last2 = Diecke | first2 = S. | last3 = Grigoryan | first3 = T. | last4 = Quiroga-Negreira | first4 = A. | last5 = Birchmeier | first5 = W. | last6 = Besser | first6 = D. | pmc=3128971}}&lt;/ref&gt; During reprogramming for iPS cell generation, [[CDH2|N-cadherin]] can replace function of E-cadherin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.scr.2013.08.009| pmid = 24036274| title = Adhesion, but not a specific cadherin code, is indispensable for ES cell and induced pluripotency| journal = Stem Cell Research| volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = 1250–1263| year = 2013| last1 = Bedzhov | first1 = I. | last2 = Alotaibi | first2 = H. | last3 = Basilicata | first3 = M.

For example, neural progenitor cells can be generated from fibroblasts directly through a physical approach without introducing exogenous reprogramming factors.

Physical cues, in the form of parallel microgrooves on the surface of cell-adhesive substrates, can replace the effects of small-molecule epigenetic modifiers and significantly improve reprogramming efficiency. The mechanism relies on the mechanomodulation of the cells' epigenetic state. Specifically, "decreased histone deacetylase activity and upregulation of the expression of WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5) – a subunit of H3 methyltranferase – by microgrooved surfaces lead to increased histone H3 acetylation and methylation". Nanofibrous scaffolds with aligned fibre orientation produce effects similar to those produced by microgrooves, suggesting that changes in cell morphology may be responsible for modulation of the epigenetic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nmat3777| pmid = 24141451| title = Biophysical regulation of epigenetic state and cell reprogramming| journal = Nature Materials| volume = 12| issue = 12| pages = 1154–1162| year = 2013| last1 = Downing | first1 = T.

Substrate rigidity is an important biophysical cue influencing neural induction and subtype specification. For example, soft substrates promote neuroepithelial conversion while inhibiting [[neural crest]] differentiation of hESCs in a [[Bone morphogenetic protein 4|BMP4]]-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies revealed a multi-targeted mechanotransductive process involving mechanosensitive [[SMAD (protein)|Smad]] [[phosphorylation]] and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, regulated by rigidity-dependent [[Hippo signaling pathway|Hippo]]/[[YAP1|YAP]] activities and [[actomyosin]] [[cytoskeleton]] integrity and [[contractility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sun | first1 = Yubing | last2 = Koh | last3 = Aw Yong | first3 = Meng | last4 = Villa-Diaz | first4 = Luis G. | last5 = Fu | first5 = Jianping | year = 2014 | title = Hippo/YAP-mediated rigidity-dependent motor neuron differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells | journal = Nature Materials | volume =  13| issue = 6| pages =  599–604| doi = 10.1038/nmat3945 | pmid=24728461 | pmc=4051885}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) undergo self-renewal in the presence of the [[cytokine]] [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] (LIF). Following LIF withdrawal, mESCs differentiate, accompanied by an increase in cell–substratum [[adhesion]] and cell spreading. Restricted cell spreading in the absence of LIF by either culturing mESCs on chemically defined, weakly adhesive biosubstrates, or by manipulating the [[cytoskeleton]] allowed the cells to remain in an undifferentiated and pluripotent state. The effect of restricted cell spreading on mESC self-renewal is not mediated by increased intercellular adhesion, as inhibition of mESC adhesion using a function blocking anti E-cadherin antibody or [[siRNA]] does not promote differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biocel.2013.07.001| title = The self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells is regulated by cell–substratum adhesion and cell spreading| journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology| volume = 45| issue = 11| pages = 2698–2705| year = 2013| last1 = Murray | first1 = P. | last2 = Prewitz | first2 = M. | last3 = Hopp | first3 = I. | last4 = Wells | first4 = N. | last5 = Zhang | first5 = H. | last6 = Cooper | first6 = A. | last7 = Parry | first7 = K.

A new method has been developed that turns cells into stem cells faster and more efficiently by 'squeezing' them using 3D microenvironment stiffness and density of the surrounding gel.

Cells involved in the reprogramming process change morphologically as the process proceeds. This results in physical difference in adhesive forces among cells. Substantial differences in 'adhesive signature' between pluripotent stem cells, partially reprogrammed cells, differentiated progeny and somatic cells allowed to develop separation process for isolation of pluripotent stem cells in [[microfluidic device]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2437| pmid = 23563795| title = Adhesion strength–based, label-free isolation of human pluripotent stem cells| journal = Nature Methods| volume = 10| issue = 5| pages = 438–444| year = 2013| last1 = Singh | first1 = A. | last2 = Suri | first2 = S. | last3 = Lee | first3 = T. | last4 = Chilton | first4 = J.

=== Oligodendrocyte precursor cells ===

Without [[myelin]] to insulate neurons, nerve signals quickly lose power. Diseases that attack myelin, such as multiple sclerosis, result in nerve signals that cannot propagate to nerve endings and as a consequence lead to cognitive, motor and sensory problems. Transplantation of [[oligodendrocyte]] precursor cells (OPCs), which can successfully create myelin sheaths around nerve cells, is a promising potential therapeutic response.

Furthermore, transplantation of cardiac transcription factors into injured murine hearts resulted in poor cell survival and minimal expression of cardiac genes.&lt;ref name="Sean"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.270264| pmid = 22581928| pmc = 3390172| title = Inefficient Reprogramming of Fibroblasts into Cardiomyocytes Using Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5| journal = Circulation Research| volume = 111| issue = 1| pages = 50–55| year = 2012| last1 = Chen | first1 = J.

The team of scientists, who were led by Sheng Ding, used a cocktail of nine chemicals (9C) for transdifferentiation of human skin cells into beating heart cells. With this method, more than 97% of the cells began beating, a characteristic of fully developed, healthy heart cells. The chemically induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (ciCMs) uniformly contracted and resembled human cardiomyocytes in their transcriptome, epigenetic, and electrophysiological properties. When transplanted into infarcted mouse hearts, 9C-treated fibroblasts were efficiently converted to ciCMs and developed into healthy-looking heart muscle cells within the organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cao | first1 = Nan | last2 = Huang | first2 = Yu | last3 = Zheng | first3 = Jiashun | last4 = Srivastava | first4 = Deepak | last5 = Ding | first5 = Sheng | year = 2016 | title = Conversion of human fibroblasts into functional cardiomyocytes by small molecules | url = | journal = Science | volume =  352| issue = 6290| pages =  1216–1220| doi = 10.1126/science.aaf1502 | pmid = 27127239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This chemical reprogramming approach, after further optimization, may offer an easy way to provide the cues that induce heart muscle to regenerate locally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gladstone.org/about-us/news/scientists-turn-skin-cells-heart-cells-and-brain-cells-using-drugs?sf25398259=1  Scientists Turn Skin Cells into Heart Cells and Brain Cells Using Drugs].

In another study, [[ischemic cardiomyopathy]] in the murine infarction model was targeted by iPS cell transplantation.

Discovery of the mechanisms controlling the formation of cardiomyocytes led to the development of the drug ITD-1, which effectively clears the cell surface from [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-β]] receptor type II and selectively inhibits intracellular TGF-β signaling. It thus selectively enhances the differentiation of uncommitted [[mesoderm]] to cardiomyocytes, but not to vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells.&lt;ref name="Mercola"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2012.04.025| pmid = 22862949| title = Small Molecule-Mediated TGF-β Type II Receptor Degradation Promotes Cardiomyogenesis in Embryonic Stem Cells| journal = Cell Stem Cell| volume = 11| issue = 2| pages = 242–252| year = 2012| last1 = Willems | first1 = E. | last2 = Cabral-Teixeira | first2 = J. | last3 = Schade | first3 = D. | last4 = Cai | first4 = W. | last5 = Reeves | first5 = P. | last6 = Bushway | first6 = P.

One project seeded decellularized mouse hearts with human iPSC-derived multipotential cardiovascular progenitor cells. The introduced cells migrated, proliferated and differentiated in situ into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells to reconstruct the hearts. In addition, the heart's extracellular matrix (the substrate of heart scaffold) signalled the human cells into becoming the specialised cells needed for proper heart function. After 20 days of perfusion with growth factors, the engineered heart tissues started to beat again and were responsive to drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ncomms3307| title = Repopulation of decellularized mouse heart with human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiovascular progenitor cells| journal = Nature Communications| volume = 4| year = 2013| last1 = Lu | first1 = T.

Reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) ''in situ'' represents a promising strategy for cardiac regeneration. Mice exposed ''in vivo'', to three cardiac transcription factors GMT (Gata4, Mef2c, Tbx5) and the small-molecules: [[SB-431542]] (the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β inhibitor), and XAV939 (the WNT inhibitor) for 2 weeks after myocardial infarction showed significantly improved reprogramming (reprogramming efficiency increased eight-fold) and cardiac function compared to those exposed to only GMT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mohamed | first1 = Tamer M.

===Rejuvenation of the muscle stem cell===
The elderly often suffer from progressive [[muscle weakness]] and regenerative failure owing in part to elevated activity of the [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38α and p38β mitogen-activated kinase]] pathway in senescent skeletal muscle stem cells. Subjecting such stem cells to transient inhibition of p38α and p38β in conjunction with culture on soft [[hydrogel]] substrates rapidly expands and rejuvenates them that result in the return of their strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cosgrove | first1 = B.

In geriatric mice, resting satellite cells lose reversible quiescence by switching to an irreversible pre-senescence state, caused by derepression of [[p16]]INK4a (also called Cdkn2a). 
On injury, these cells fail to activate and expand, even in a youthful environment. p16INK4a silencing in geriatric satellite cells restores quiescence and muscle regenerative functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature13013| pmid = 24522534| title = Geriatric muscle stem cells switch reversible quiescence into senescence| journal = Nature| volume = 506| issue = 7488| pages = 316–321| year = 2014| last1 = Sousa-Victor | first1 = P. | last2 = Gutarra | first2 = S. | last3 = García-Prat | first3 = L. | last4 = Rodriguez-Ubreva | first4 = J. | last5 = Ortet | first5 = L. | last6 = Ruiz-Bonilla | first6 = V. | last7 = Jardí | first7 = M. | last8 = Ballestar | first8 = E. | last9 = González | first9 = S. | last10 = Serrano | first10 = A.

=== Hepatocytes ===
Unlike current protocols for deriving [[hepatocyte]]s from human fibroblasts, Saiyong Zhu et al., (2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature13020| pmid = 24572354| title = Mouse liver repopulation with hepatocytes generated from human fibroblasts| journal = Nature| volume = 508| issue = 7494| pages = 93–97| year = 2014| last1 = Zhu | first1 = S. | last2 = Rezvani | first2 = M. | last3 = Harbell | first3 = J. | last4 = Mattis | first4 = A.

After transplantation into an immune-deficient mouse model of human liver failure, iMPC-Heps proliferated extensively and acquired levels of hepatocyte function similar to those of human primary adult hepatocytes. iMPC-Heps did not form tumours, most probably because they never entered a pluripotent state.

These results establish the feasibility of significant liver repopulation of mice with human hepatocytes generated in vitro, which removes a long-standing roadblock on the path to autologous liver cell therapy.

Cocktail of small molecules, [[Y-27632]], A-83-01 (a TGFβ kinase/activin receptor like kinase ([[ALK5]]) inhibitor), and CHIR99021 (potent inhibitor of  [[GSK-3]]), can convert rat and mouse mature hepatocytes in vitro into proliferative bipotent cells – CLiPs (chemically induced liver progenitors). CLiPs can differentiate into both mature hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells that can form functional ductal structures.  In long-term culture CLiPs did not lose their proliferative capacity and their hepatic differentiation ability, and can repopulate chronically injured liver tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Katsuda | first1 = T | last2 = Kawamata | first2 = M | last3 = Hagiwara | first3 = K | last4 = Takahashi | first4 = R | last5 = Yamamoto | first5 = Y | last6 = Camargo | first6 = FD | last7 = Ochiya | first7 = T | year = 2017| title = Conversion of Terminally Committed Hepatocytes to Culturable Bipotent Progenitor Cells with Regenerative Capacity | url = http://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(16)30347-2 | journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume =  20| issue = 1| pages = 41–55 | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2016.10.007 | pmid = 27840021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insulin-producing cells ===
Complications of [[Diabetes mellitus]] such as [[cardiovascular diseases]], [[Diabetic retinopathy|retinopathy]], [[Diabetic neuropathy|neuropathy]], [[Diabetic nephropathy|nephropathy]] and peripheral circulatory diseases depend on [[Blood sugar regulation|sugar dysregulation]] due to lack of [[insulin]] from pancreatic [[beta cells]] and can be lethal if they are not treated. One of the promising approaches to understand and cure diabetes is to use pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced PCSs (iPSCs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abdelalim | first1 = E.

Unfortunately, human PSC-derived insulin-expressing cells resemble human fetal β cells rather than adult β cells. In contrast to adult β cells, fetal β cells seem functionally immature, as indicated by increased [[Basal rate|basal]] [[glucose]] secretion and lack of glucose stimulation and confirmed by [[RNA-seq]] of whose [[Transcription (genetics)|transcript]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hrvatin | first1 = S. | last2 = O'Donnell | first2 = C.

Adult proximal tubule cells were directly transcriptionally reprogrammed to [[nephron]] progenitors of the embryonic [[kidney]], using a pool of six genes of instructive transcription factors (SIX1, SIX2, OSR1, Eyes absent homolog 1(EYA1), Homeobox A11 (HOXA11) and Snail homolog 2 (SNAI2)) that activated genes consistent with a cap mesenchyme/nephron progenitor phenotype in the adult proximal tubule cell line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1681/ASN.2012121143| pmid = 23766537| title = Direct Transcriptional Reprogramming of Adult Cells to Embryonic Nephron Progenitors| journal = Journal of the American Society of Nephrology| volume = 24| issue = 9| pages = 1424–1434| year = 2013| last1 = Hendry | first1 = C.

=== Blood vessel cells ===

As blood vessels age, they often become abnormal in structure and function, thereby contributing to numerous age-associated diseases including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and atherosclerosis of arteries supplying the heart, brain and lower extremities. So, an important goal is to stimulate vascular growth for the [[collateral circulation]] to prevent the exacerbation of these diseases. Induced Vascular Progenitor Cells (iVPCs) are useful for cell-based therapy designed to stimulate coronary collateral growth. They were generated by partially reprogramming endothelial cells.&lt;ref name="Kurian" /&gt; The vascular commitment of iVPCs is related to the [[Genetic memory (biology)#Inherited epigenetic memory|epigenetic memory]] of endothelial cells, which engenders them as cellular components of growing blood vessels. That is why, when iVPCs were implanted into [[myocardium]], they engrafted in blood vessels and increased coronary collateral flow better than iPSCs, mesenchymal stem cells, or native endothelial cells.&lt;ref name="Chilian"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.250126| pmid = 22095729| title = Induction of Vascular Progenitor Cells from Endothelial Cells Stimulates Coronary Collateral Growth| journal = Circulation Research| volume = 110| issue = 2| pages = 241–252| year = 2011| last1 = Yin | first1 = L.| last2 = Ohanyan | first2 = V.| last3 = Fen Pung | first3 = Y.| last4 = Delucia | first4 = A.| last5 = Bailey | first5 = E.| last6 = Enrick | first6 = M.| last7 = Stevanov | first7 = K.| last8 = Kolz | first8 = C.

To treat infarction, it is important to prevent the formation of fibrotic scar tissue. This can be achieved in vivo by transient application of [[paracrine]] factors that redirect native heart progenitor stem cell contributions from scar tissue to cardiovascular tissue. For example, in a mouse myocardial infarction model, a single intramyocardial injection of human [[vascular endothelial growth factor A]] mRNA (VEGF-A modRNA), modified to escape the body's normal defense system, results in long-term improvement of heart function due to mobilization and redirection of epicardial progenitor cells toward cardiovascular cell types.&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/nbt.2682"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2682| pmid = 24013197| title = Modified mRNA directs the fate of heart progenitor cells and induces vascular regeneration after myocardial infarction| journal = Nature Biotechnology| volume = 31| issue = 10| pages = 898–907| year = 2013| last1 = Zangi | first1 = L. | last2 = Lui | first2 = K.

[[File:1908 Platelet Development.jpg|thumb|Platelets extruded from megakaryocytes]]

==== Platelets ====
[[Platelets]] help prevent hemorrhage in [[thrombocytopenic]] patients and patients with [[thrombocythemia]]. A significant problem for multitransfused patients is refractoriness to platelet transfusions. Thus, the ability to generate platelet products ex vivo and platelet products lacking [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA antigens]] in serum-free media would have clinical value.
An [[RNA interference]]-based mechanism used a [[Viral vector|lentiviral vector]] to express short-hairpin RNAi targeting β2-microglobulin transcripts in CD34-positive cells. Generated platelets demonstrated an 85% reduction in class I HLA antigens. These platelets appeared to have normal function in vitro&lt;ref name=" Figueiredo "&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02644.x| pmid = 20412529| title = Generation of HLA-deficient platelets from hematopoietic progenitor cells| journal = Transfusion| volume = 50| issue = 8| pages = 1690–1701| year = 2010| last1 = Figueiredo | first1 = C.

One clinically-applicable strategy for the derivation of functional platelets from human iPSC involves the establishment of stable immortalized megakaryocyte progenitor cell lines (imMKCLs) through [[doxycycline]]-dependent overexpression of [[BMI1]] and [[Bcl-xL|BCL-XL]]. The resulting imMKCLs can be expanded in culture over extended periods (4–5 months), even after [[cryopreservation]]. Halting the overexpression (by the removal of doxycycline from the medium) of c-MYC, [[BMI1]] and [[Bcl-xL|BCL-XL]] in growing imMKCLs led to the production of [[GP1BA|CD42b]]+ platelets with functionality comparable to that of native platelets on the basis of a range of assays in vitro and in vivo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2014.01.011| pmid = 24529595| title = Expandable Megakaryocyte Cell Lines Enable Clinically Applicable Generation of Platelets from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells| journal = Cell Stem Cell| volume = 14| issue = 4| pages = 535–548| year = 2014| last1 = Nakamura | first1 = S. | last2 = Takayama | first2 = N. | last3 = Hirata | first3 = S. | last4 = Seo | first4 = H. | last5 = Endo | first5 = H. | last6 = Ochi | first6 = K. | last7 = Fujita | first7 = K.

Thomas et al., describe a forward programming strategy relying on the concurrent exogenous expression of 3 transcription factors: [[GATA1]], [[FLI1]] and [[TAL1]]. The forward programmed [[megakaryocyte#Platelet release|megakaryocyte]]s proliferate and differentiate in culture for several months with megakaryocyte purity over 90% reaching up to 2x10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; mature megakaryocytes per input hPSC. Functional platelets are generated throughout the culture allowing the prospective collection of several transfusion units from as few as one million starting hPSCs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/253670  Large scale production of megakaryocytes from human pluripotent stem cells by a chemically defined forward programming approach]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Immune cells ====

A specialised type of [[white blood cell]], known as [[cytotoxic T cell|cytotoxic T]] [[lymphocytes]] (CTLs), are produced by the [[immune system]] and are able to recognise specific markers on the surface of various infectious or tumour cells, causing them to launch an attack to kill the harmful cells. Thence, immunotherapy with functional antigen-specific T cells has potential as a therapeutic strategy for combating many cancers and viral infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.iy.13.040195.002553| pmid = 7612234| title = Principles for Adoptive T Cell Therapy of Human Viral Diseases| journal = Annual Review of Immunology| volume = 13| pages = 545–586| year = 1995| last1 = Riddell | first1 = S.

=== Thymic epithelial cells rejuvenation ===
The [[thymus]] is the first organ to deteriorate as people age. This shrinking is one of the main reasons the immune system becomes less effective with age. Diminished expression of the [[thymic epithelial cell]] transcription factor [[FOXN1]] has been implicated as a component of the mechanism regulating age-related involution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guo | first1 = J. | last2 = Feng | first2 = Y. | last3 = Barnes | first3 = P. | last4 = Huang | first4 = F.

[[Clare Blackburn]] and colleagues show that established age-related thymic involution can be reversed by forced upregulation of just one transcription factor – FOXN1 in the thymic epithelial cells in order to promote [[Rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]], proliferation and differentiation of these cells into fully functional thymic epithelium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bredenkamp | first1 = Nicholas | last2 = Nowell | first2 = Craig S. | last3 = Blackburn | first3 = C.

This rejuvenation and increased proliferation was accompanied by upregulation of genes that promote [[cell cycle]] progression ([[cyclin D1]], ΔN[[TP63|p63]], [[Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2#Isoforms|FgfR2IIIb]]) and that are required in the thymic epithelial cells to promote specific aspects of [[T cell]] development ([[DLL4|Dll4]], [[Stem cell factor|Kit]]l, [[CCL25|Ccl25]], [[Stromal cell-derived factor 1|Cxcl12]], [[CD40 (protein)|Cd40]], [[CD80|Cd80]], [[Cathepsin L1|Ctsl]], [[PAX1|Pax1]]).

The chemical cocktail directly converts human fibroblasts to iMSCs with a monolayer culture in 6 days, and the conversion rate was approximately 38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/srep44534 | pmid=28303927 | pmc=5356011 | volume=7 | title=Efficient Generation of Chemically Induced Mesenchymal Stem Cells from Human Dermal Fibroblasts | year=2017 | journal=Scientific Reports | page=44534 | last1 = Lai | first1 = Pei-Lun | last2 = Lin | first2 = Hsuan | last3 = Chen | first3 = Shang-Fu | last4 = Yang | first4 = Shang-Chih | last5 = Hung | first5 = Kuo-Hsuan | last6 = Chang | first6 = Ching-Fang | last7 = Chang | first7 = Hsiang-Yi | last8 = Leigh Lu | first8 = Frank | last9 = Lee | first9 = Yi-Hsuan | last10 = Liu | first10 = Yu-Chuan | last11 = Huang | first11 = Hsiao-Chun | last12 = Lu | first12 = Jean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dedifferentiated adipocytes ====

[[Adipose]] tissue, because of its abundance and relatively less invasive harvest methods, represents a source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Unfortunately, liposuction aspirates are only 0.05% MSCs.&lt;ref name="Bieback"/&gt; However, a large amount of mature adipocytes, which in general have lost their proliferative abilities and therefore are typically discarded, can be easily isolated from the adipose cell suspension and dedifferentiated into [[lipid]]-free fibroblast-like cells, named dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells. DFAT cells re-establish active proliferation ability and express multipotent capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.5966/sctm.2013-0107| pmid = 24396033| title = Pluripotent Stem Cells Derived from Mouse and Human White Mature Adipocytes| journal = Stem Cells Translational Medicine| volume = 3| issue = 2| pages = 161–171| year = 2014| last1 = Jumabay | first1 = M.| last2 = Abdmaulen | first2 = R.| last3 = Ly | first3 = A.| last4 = Cubberly | first4 = M.

=== Chondrogenic cells ===

[[Cartilage]] is the connective tissue responsible for frictionless joint movement. Its degeneration ultimately results in complete loss of joint function in the late stages of [[osteoarthritis]]. As an avascular and hypocellular tissue, cartilage has a limited capacity for self-repair. [[Chondrocyte]]s are the only cell type in cartilage, in which they are surrounded by the extracellular matrix that they secrete and assemble.

One method of producing cartilage is to induce it from iPS cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1089/ten.teb.2012.0757| pmid = 23957872| pmc = 4123466| title = Generating Cartilage Repair from Pluripotent Stem Cells| journal = Tissue Engineering Part B: Reviews| volume = 20| issue = 4| pages = 131030093023007| year = 2013| last1 = Cheng | first1 = A. | last2 = Hardingham | first2 = T. E. | last3 = Kimber | first3 = S. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it is possible to convert fibroblasts directly into induced chondrogenic cells (iChon) without an intermediate iPS cell stage, by inserting three reprogramming factors (c-MYC, KLF4 and SOX9).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0077365| pmid = 24146984| title = Direct Induction of Chondrogenic Cells from Human Dermal Fibroblast Culture by Defined Factors| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 8| issue = 10| pages = e77365| year = 2013| last1 = Outani | first1 = H. | last2 = Okada | first2 = M. | last3 = Yamashita | first3 = A. | last4 = Nakagawa | first4 = K. | last5 = Yoshikawa | first5 = H. | last6 = Tsumaki | first6 = N. | pmc=3797820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human iChon cells expressed marker genes for chondrocytes (type II collagen) but not fibroblasts.

Implanted into defects created in the articular cartilage of rats, human iChon cells survived to form cartilaginous tissue for at least four weeks, with no tumors. The method makes use of c-MYC, which is thought to have a major role in tumorigenesis and employs a [[retrovirus]] to introduce the reprogramming factors, excluding it from unmodified use in human therapy.&lt;ref name="Hiromitsu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crompton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crompton009"/&gt;

This epigenetic memory does not necessarily manifest itself at the pluripotency stage – iPSCs derived from different tissues exhibit proper morphology, express pluripotency markers and are able to differentiate into the three embryonic layers in vitro and in vivo. However, this epigenetic memory may manifest during re-differentiation into specific cell types that require the specific loci bearing residual epigenetic marks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1673">The '''Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology''' ('''IVPP'''; {{zh|中国科学院古脊椎动物与古人类研究所}}) of [[People's Republic of China|China]] is a research institution and collections repository for [[fossil]]s, including many [[dinosaur]] and [[pterosaur]] specimens (many from the [[Yixian Formation]]).  As its name suggests, research is focused on both [[paleontology|paleontological]] topics and those relating to [[human]] [[prehistory]].

The institution, located in [[Beijing]], grew out of the Cenozoic Research Laboratory in 1929 and is its own institution under the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].  Its staff have increasingly worked internationally, and were authors or coauthors on 45 ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' articles from 1999 to  2005.&lt;ref name=IVPPpr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.ivpp.cas.cn/au/bi/ |title=Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences |accessdate=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable [[paleontologist]]s who have been affiliated with the IVPP include [[Yang Zhongjian]] (also known as C. C. Young), [[Dong Zhiming]], [[Meemann Chang]] and [[Zhao Xijin]].

[[File:Drive time isochrones airports northern Finland.png|thumb|Isochrone map showing drive times around airports in northern Finland, created using [[GIS software]] (2011)]]
An '''isochrone map''' (or chart/diagram) in [[geography]] and [[urban planning]] is a map showing areas related to [[wikt:isochrone|isochrone]]s between different points. An isochrone is defined as "a line drawn on a map connecting points at which something occurs or arrives at the same time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.mayerbrown.com/files/Publication/7633e871-05b8-428f-bbcd-cf6d9163bab8/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/c7b45b1f-d4f4-413c-b5aa-b0579c87049f/Isochrones-Desai_Iss2_1108.pdf |title=Isochrones: Analysis of  Local Geographic Markets |last=Desai |first=Kiran |date=17 October 2008 |website=Mayer Brown |access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a map is sometimes termed simply an '''isochrone''' (iso = equal, chrone = time).

It shows the travel times in 1881 from [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] to different parts of the world in days. It assumes that there are favourable travel conditions and that travel arrangements over land have been made in advance. It assumes travelling methods of the day within a reasonable cost.]]
Isochrone maps have been used in transportation planning since 1887 or earlier.&lt;ref name="mapping manchester 2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/m.dodge/mappingmanchester/ | title=Mapping Manchester project | date=October 2013 | accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anregungen für die Konstruktion und die Verwendung von Isochronenkarten."&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/ldpd_6044064_000 | title=Dissertation of Johannes Riedel| date=1911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples of Isochrone maps include the [[Francis Galton|Galton´s]] ''Isochronic Postal Charts'' and ''Isochronic Passage Charts'' of 1881 and 1882,&lt;ref name="On the Construction of Isochronic Passage Charts"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where as Galton and the Bartholomews published maps depicting the days or weeks it took to travel long distances, Albrecht further developed the idea to not only depict long distances and world travel but also smaller areas. Penck also created a series of maps that only depict the travel times of a certain transportation mode, for example [[Rail transport]].

===Transport planning===
[[File:Map of Melbourne and environs minimum railway or tramway time zones.jpg|thumb|An early isochrone map of Melbourne rail transport travel times, 1910-1922]]
Isochrone maps in the context of transport planning are essentially maps of [[Accessibility (transport)|accessibility]] where travel time is used as the cost the metric. Isochrone maps can be created for different [[mode of transport|modes of transportation]],&lt;ref name="cikm 2011"&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2063972&amp;CFID=91078296&amp;CFTOKEN=23380158 | title=Defining isochrones in multimodal spatial networks | accessdate=March 21, 2012 | author=Gamper Johann | booktitle=Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management | year=2011 | conference=[[Conference on Information and Knowledge Management|CIKM]] | location=Glasgow | author2=Böhlen, Michael | author3=Cometti, Willi | author4=Innerebner, Markus | DOI=10.1145/2063576.2063972 | ISBN=9781450307178}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. foot, bicycle, motor vehicle.

In [[Higher Criticism|historical-critical]] analysis, the '''L source''' is an inferred oral tradition which [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] used when composing [[Gospel of Luke|his gospel]].&lt;ref name = "5GIntro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Brice|title=Matthean and Lukan Special Material: A Brief Introduction with Texts in Greek and English|year=2011|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-61097-737-1|url=https://wipfandstock.com/store/Matthean_and_Lukan_Special_Material_A_Brief_Introduction_with_Texts_in_Greek_and_English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the [[virgin birth of Jesus]] and many of Jesus' best loved [[Parables of Jesus|parables]]. Like [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]'s unique source, known as [[M-Source|M]], the L source has important parables.&lt;ref name = "5GIntro"&gt;[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The five gospels.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1993. "Introduction," p 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Two which appear in L are the [[Good Samaritan]] and the [[Prodigal Son]].&lt;ref name = "5GIntro"/&gt; [[I. Howard Marshall]] states "Luke rightly regarded these sources as reliable".&lt;ref&gt; IVP New Testament Commentary 21st century edition pp 979&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Four Document Hypothesis]], Luke combined [[Mark's Gospel|Mark]], the [[Q source]], and L to produce his gospel.&lt;ref name = "5GIntro"/&gt; The material in L, like that in M, probably comes from the oral tradition.&lt;ref name = "5GIntro"/&gt; Luke's special material composes nearly half of his gospel.&lt;ref name = "TM1998 2"&gt;Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz. The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide. Fortress Press. 1998. translated from German (1996 edition). Chapter 2. Christian sources about Jesus.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of how to explain the similarities among the Gospels Matthew, Mark, and Luke is known as the [[synoptic problem]]. The hypothetical L source fits a contemporary solution in which Mark was the first gospel and Q was a written source for both Matthew and Luke.

'''Marbles Reunited: Friends of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles''' is a campaign group, governed by charter and funded by donations from members and supporters, which lobbies and raises awareness about the case for the return of the [[Elgin marbles|Parthenon (Elgin) marbles]] to Athens, Greece.

==History==
The organization was set up in 2001 by [[Richard Allan, Baron Allan of Hallam|Richard Allan]], [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]] and Archaeologist. Initially the campaign was called Parthenon 2004. The members of the committee hoped that the [[2004 Olympic Games]] in [[Athens]] would act as a catalyst to renew interest and raise awareness about the reunification of the Parthenon Marbles. In 2005 the organization changed its name to Marbles Reunited to reflect the ongoing aspirations of the campaign, while not being tied to a specific date.

==Organisation==
The current executive committee members are:
* '''Honorary President''' Eddie O’Hara 
* '''Chair''' [[Andrew George (politician)|Andrew George]]  [[Member of Parliament|MP]]
* '''Vice Chair''' Rea Hajifanis
* '''Treasurer''' Matthew Taylor
* '''Secretary''' Angelo Economou

Other members of the organisation include:
* [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]],  Australians for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures and Chair of the [[International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]]
* [[Christopher Miles]], film director
* Geoffrey White, barrister
* [[Andrew Dismore]] Former British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Politician and [[London Assembly]] member
* Christopher Stockdale
* [[William G. Stewart|William G Stewart]], broadcaster
* Apostolos Polyzoides
* Jean Polyzoides
* Maria Koutsikou,  Campaign Manager for Marbles Reunited

The original members of the Committee were:
* [[Nicky Artemi]], campaign manager
* [[Peter Derow]], ancient historian
* [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]], Australians for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures
* [[Clare Makepeace]], Parliamentary researcher
* [[Christopher Miles]], film director

* [[William G. Stewart]], broadcaster
* [[Matthew Taylor (architect)|Matthew Taylor]], architect
* [[Geoffrey White (barrister)|Geoffrey White]], barrister
* [[Malcolm Wright]], internet consultant

==Activities==
The members of Marbles Reunited have organised and/or had significant involvement in a large number of events throughout the United Kingdom and abroad.
* In 2009 [[Edward O'Hara]] set out an [[Early day motion|EDM]] (Early Day Motion) to lobby members of Parliament:
:"That this House notes the forthcoming opening of the new Acropolis Museum in Athens in the spring of 2009; congratulates the Greek government on the completion of a    truly world-class new home for the treasures of the Acropolis hill; recognises the unique beauty of the top floor gallery of the museum, built to the same size and orientation as the Parthenon itself and designed specifically for the display of the surviving Parthenon sculptures as an artistic unit and in the best possible location and light with the Parthenon itself in full simultaneous view; regrets the fact that for as long as the surviving Parthenon sculptures are kept separately in the British Museum and in Greece they cannot be viewed in this optimum context; and calls on the Government to encourage and facilitate the opening of discussions between the British Museum and the Greek authorities with the purpose of the reunification of the Parthenon sculptures in Athens with responsibility for their display, curation and study being shared between the British Museum and the new Acropolis Museum in accordance with the best contemporary museum practice."
* In July 2012 Chair  [[Andrew George (politician)|Andrew George MP]] argued in favour of reunification of the [[Parthenon Marbles]] alongside [[Stephen Fry]] at the [[Intelligence Squared]] debate that took place at [[Cadogan Hall]].
* Marbles Reunited is involved in ongoing meetings with the Greek Minister of culture.

==Affiliations==
Marbles Reunited works closely with the [[British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles]], another organisation that supports the return of the [[Parthenon Marbles|Parthenon (Elgin) marbles]] to Athens, Greece. In 2008, Marbles Reunited was accepted as a member of the [[International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]].

'''Methyl green-pyronin (MGP)''' is a classical [[Histology#Staining|histological staining]] technique using two [[base (chemistry)|basic]] (cationic) dyes for the demonstration and differentiation of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. [[Methyl green]] is specific for [[phosphate]] [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]] in the [[Nucleic acid double helix|DNA double helix]] staining it green-blue. [[Pyronin]] does not possess this affinity and binds to the remaining negatively charged RNA staining it red. The method is useful in identifying the distribution of [[Nissl substance]] in [[neuron]]al cell bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Suvarna, S.K., Layton, C. and Bancroft, J.D. 2013, ''Bancroft's Theory and Practice of Histological Techniques'', 7th edn, Churchill Livingstone Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MinID''' is an [[:wikt:electronic|electronic]] login system used to secure a range of [[internet]] services in the [[Norway|Norwegian]] public sector. The communication done with MinID is encrypted to secure information from unauthorized usage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.difi.no/elektronisk-id/minid/security-and-privacy&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone registered in the [[Norwegian Population Register]] over the age of 13 years can create a public ID with MinID.

As of April 2010, more than 2 million people living in [[Norway]] had created user accounts with MinID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minid.difi.no/minid/minid.php?lang=en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201174956/http://minid.difi.no/minid/minid.php?lang=en |archivedate=2009-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To create a public ID, PIN-codes from the Norwegian Tax Administration are needed.

== Purpose ==

The purpose of MinID is to communicate an electronic identity, so that users are authorized to use electronic services, in a secure way. MinID has a user database where social security numbers and PIN-codes are saved. MinID can be used to access more than 50 online services from various Norwegian public agencies, including the [[Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration]], the Directorate of Taxes and the [[Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund|State Educational Loan]].

== Controller ==

The Agency for Public Management and e-Government (Difi) is the controller of the personal data handled by MinID. The Agency for Public Management and eGovernment (Norwegian: Direktoratet for forvaltning og informasjons- og kommunikasjonsteknologi) or Difi is a government agency subordinate to the [[Norwegian Ministry of Government Administration and Reform]]. It is responsible for help the public sector achieve quality, efficiency, user friendliness, openness and participation, as well as helping the public sector be organized and led in a good way with good intersectoral cooperation.

== User profile ==

Users of MinID have a user profile that contains their [[mobile phone]] number and/or [[e-mail]] address. This data is used to administrate MinID use. The e-mail address is needed in order to send the user a temporary password if he or she forgets the password. The phone number is needed in order to send an SMS-code at log in or a temporary password if the user forgets the password.

== Transparency, correction and deletion ==

According to the law users can claim full access of the handling of their own personal data. Users also have the right to information about how this data are handled and saved, and how they can correct or delete inaccurate data. Users can at any time choose to delete themselves as a user of MinID. The user profile will then be deleted from the MinID user database.

== Extradition to others ==

MinID passes on the user's social security number and chosen language to the public services he or she logs on to, so that the user can go to other public services without a new login.

[[File:Orchestra.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A symphony orchestra]]

''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'' defines '''music criticism''' as 'the intellectual activity of formulating judgements on the value and degree of excellence of individual works of music, or whole groups or genres'.&lt;ref&gt;Bujic, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it is a branch of [[musical aesthetics]]. With the concurrent expansion of interest in music and information media over the past century, the term has come to acquire the conventional meaning of journalistic reporting on musical performances.&lt;ref&gt;Bujic, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of music criticism==

The musicologist [[Winton Dean]] has suggested that "music is probably the most difficult of the arts to criticize."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 44&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[plastic arts|plastic]] or literary arts, the 'language' of music does not specifically relate to human sensory experience - Dean's words, "the word 'love' is common coin in life and literature: the note C has nothing to do with breakfast or railway journeys or marital harmony."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Like dramatic art, music is recreated at every performance, and criticism may therefore be directed both at the text (musical score) and the performance. More specifically, as music has a temporal dimension that requires repetition or development of its material "problems of balance, contrast, expectation and fulfilment ... are more central to music than to other arts, supported as these are by verbal or representational content."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of a clearly evolved or consensual musical aesthetics has also tended to make music criticism a highly subjective issue. "There is no counter-check outside the critic's own personality."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 46-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===To end of 18th century===
Critical references to music (often deprecating performers or styles) can be found in early literature, including, for example, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' and in the writings of medieval music theorists.

According to [[Richard Taruskin]], the active concert life of late 18th-century London meant that "the role and the function of arts criticism as we know it today were the creations of the English public."&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (2010) 571.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first magazines specifically devoted to music criticism seem to have developed in Germany, for example [[Georg Philipp Telemann]]'s ''Der getreue Music-Meister'' (1728), which included publications of new compositions, and ''Der critische Musikus'' which appeared in [[Hamburg]] between 1737 and 1740.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In France in the 1750s, the [[Querelle des Bouffons]] (the dispute between supporters of French and Italian opera styles as represented by [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] respectively) generated essays from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and others, including [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Rameau's Nephew]]'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (2010), 441-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The English composer [[Charles Avison]] (1709–1770) published the first work on musical criticism in the English language - an ''Essay on Musical Expression'' published in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;Bujic (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Avison claims that since the time of [[Palestrina]] and [[Raphael]], music had improved in status whilst pictorial art had declined.&lt;ref&gt;Avison (1752), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he believes that [[George Frideric Handel]] is too much concerned with naturalistic imitation than with expression,&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 37&lt;/ref&gt; and criticises the habit, in [[Italian opera]]s, of &lt;blockquote&gt;'that egregious absurdity of repeating, and finishing many songs with the first part; when it often happens, after the passions of anger and revenge have been sufficiently expressed, that reconcilement and love are the subjects of the second, and, therefore, should conclude the performance.'&lt;ref&gt;Avison (1752), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Typically until the late eighteenth century music criticism centred on vocal rather than instrumental music - "vocal music ... was the apex of [the] aesthetic hierarchy. One knew what music was expressing."&lt;ref&gt;Charlton (2003) 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of Romanticism===
The last years of the eighteenth century reflected both a change of patronage of music from the aristocracy to the rising middle-classes&lt;ref&gt;Conway (2012), 11-2.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of [[Romanticism]] in the arts. Both of these had consequences for the practice of music criticism; "the tone of the critic was lowered as his audience expanded: he began to approach the reader as a colleague rather than a pedagogue,"&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 38.&lt;/ref&gt; and a new generation of critics began to widen their consideration to other aspects of music than its pure representative aspects, becoming increasingly interested in instrumental music. Prominent amongst these was [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], who wrote in 1809&lt;blockquote&gt;That instrumental music has now risen to a level of which one probably had no inkling not long ago, and that the [[symphony]], especially following...Haydn and Mozart, has become the ultimate form of instrumental music - the ''opera'' of instruments, as it were - all this is well-known to every music-lover.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann (2003) 222-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further impetus to the direction of music criticism was given by the changing nature of concert programming with the establishment of the European classical music canon; indeed it is at this period that the word 'classical' is first applied to a received musical tradition. At the same time, the proportion of new music to 'canonic' music in concert programming began to decline, meaning that living composers were increasingly in competition with their dead predecessors. This was particularly the case in respect of the rise of [[Beethoven]]'s reputation in his last year and posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;Conway (2012) 50-1; Weber (2001); Weber (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise both to writings on the value of the 'canon' and also to writings by composers and their supporters defending newer music.

In 1798 the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'', edited by [[Friedrich Rochlitz]] (1769-1842), began publication in [[Leipzig]], and this is often regarded as the precursor of a new genre of criticism aimed at a wider readership than qualified connoisseurs.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (2010) 673.&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years a number of regular journals dedicated to music criticism and reviews began to appear in major European centres, including ''[[The Harmonicon]]'' (London 1823-33), ''[[The Musical Times]]'' (London, 1844-date), the ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]'' (Paris 1827-1880, founded by [[François-Joseph Fétis]]), the ''Berliner allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' founded in 1825 by [[Adolf Martin Schlesinger|A.M. Schlesinger]] and edited by [[Adolf Bernhard Marx|A. B. Marx]], and the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'' founded in 1834 in Leipzig by [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Friedrich Wieck]], and later edited by [[Franz Brendel]]. Other journals at this period also began to carry extensive writings on music: [[Hector Berlioz]] wrote for the Parisian ''[[Journal des débats]]'', [[Heinrich Heine]] reported on music and literature in Paris for the Stuttgart ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', the young [[Richard Wagner]] wrote articles for [[Heinrich Laube]]'s magazine ''Zeitung für die elegante Welt'' and during his 1839-42 stay in Paris for Schlesinger's publishing house and for German newspapers. In 1835 [[James William Davison]] (1813–85) began his lifelong career as a music critic, writing 40 years for ''[[The Times]].''&lt;ref&gt;Davison (1912) v.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NOTAR''' ('''no tail rotor''') is a [[helicopter]]  system which avoids the use of a [[tail rotor]]. It was developed by [[MD Helicopters|McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems]] (through their acquisition of [[Hughes Helicopters]]).  The system uses a fan inside the tail boom to build a high volume of low-pressure air, which exits through two slots and creates a [[boundary layer]] flow of air along the tailboom utilizing the [[Coandă effect]].  The boundary layer changes the direction of airflow around the tailboom, creating thrust opposite the motion imparted to the [[fuselage]] by the torque effect of the main rotor.  Directional yaw control is gained through a vented, rotating drum at the end of the tailboom, called the direct jet thruster. Advocates of NOTAR believe the system offers quieter and safer operation.&lt;ref name="kulikovair"&gt;[https://archive.is/20000527162120/http://www.kulikovair.com/Notar.htm kulikovair.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Cierva W.9.jpg|thumb|The [[Cierva W.9]] showing the long tailboom from which the efflux from the engine-driven fan emerged from a directable vent on the left side at the tip of the tailboom]]

The use of directed air to provide anti-torque control had been tested as early as 1945 in the British [[Cierva W.9]]. During 1957, a Spanish prototype designed and built by [[Aerotecnica]] flew using exhaust gases from the turbine instead of a tail rotor. This model was designated as [[Aerotecnica AC-14]]. 

Development of the NOTAR system dates back to 1975, when engineers at [[Hughes Helicopters]] began concept development work.&lt;ref name="Frawley Civil"&gt;Frawley, Gerard: ''The International Directory of Civil Aircraft, 2003–2004'', page 155. Aerospace Publications Pty Ltd, 2003. {{ISBN|1-875671-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1981, Hughes flew an [[OH-6 Cayuse|OH-6A]] fitted with NOTAR for the first time. The OH-6A helicopter (serial number 65-12917) was supplied by the U.S. Army for Hughes to develop the NOTAR technology and was the second OH-6 built by Hughes for the U.S. Army.  A more heavily modified version of the prototype demonstrator first flew in March 1986 (by which time [[McDonnell Douglas]] had acquired Hughes Helicopters).   The original [[prototype]] last flew in June 1986 and is now at the U.S. Army Aviation Museum in [[Fort Rucker, Alabama]].

A production model NOTAR 520N (N520NT) was later produced and first flew on May 1, 1990.  It crashed on September 27, 1994 when it collided with an [[AH-64D]] while flying as a chase aircraft for the Apache.

==Concept==

Although the concept took over three years to refine, the NOTAR system is simple in theory and works to provide some directional control using the [[Coandă effect]].&lt;ref name="Frawley Civil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdhelicopters.com/products.php?id=NOTAR NOTAR Technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312013423/http://www.mdhelicopters.com/products.php?id=NOTAR |date=2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A variable pitch fan is enclosed in the aft fuselage section immediately forward of the tail boom and driven by the main rotor transmission. This fan forces low pressure air through two slots on the right side of the tailboom,&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;NOTAR is an American designed system and so this is true for American-made helicopters whose main rotors rotate couterclockwise (viewed from above). Many helicopters made elsewhere, such as France and Russia, have clockwise rotating main rotors and with the opposite resultant torque would require the slots to be on the left.&lt;/ref&gt; causing the downwash from the main rotor to hug the tailboom, producing lift, and thus a measure of directional control. This is augmented by a direct jet thruster and vertical stabilisers.

Benefits of the NOTAR system include increased safety (the tail rotor being vulnerable), and greatly reduced external noise as tail rotors on helicopters produce a lot of noise. NOTAR-equipped helicopters are among the quietest certified helicopters.

==Applications==
[[File:md500n.g-smac.arp.jpg|thumb|right|MD Helicopters 520N NOTAR]]

There are several production helicopters that utilize the NOTAR system, which are produced by [[MD Helicopters]]:

*'''MD 520N''': a NOTAR variant of the [[MD Helicopters MD 500|Hughes/MD500]] series helicopter.
*'''[[MD Helicopters MD 600|MD 600N]]''': a larger version of the MD 520N.
*'''[[MD Helicopters MD Explorer|MD Explorer]]''': a twin-engine, eight-seat light helicopter.

The '''National Agricultural Technology Institute''' ({{lang-es|Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria}}), commonly known as '''INTA''', is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] federal [[extension agency]] in charge of the generation, adaptation and diffusion of technologies, knowledge and learning procedures for the [[agriculture]], forest and agro-industrial activities within an ecologically clean environment.

Even though the institute, created in 1956, depends on the Secretary of Agriculture, Livestock, Fishing and Food of the Ministry of Economy and Production, it has financial and operative autarkic autonomy given by law 25641/02 that provides the Institute with the 0.5% of the importations.

==Activities==

[[Image:Mesadalabmol1.jpg|thumb|240px|Molecular biology lab.]]
The INTA researches and produces information and technologies applied to processes and products, that are later forwarded to the producers. It works, for instance, in the genetic improvement and development of specific properties of diverse cereals, fruits, flowers, forest trees and vegetables, as well as the handling of cultivations and native forests.

Another important field is the sanity of the products; plagues control, weeds and diseases. It studies and researches the harvest, manipulation, packing, distribution and commercialisation of fruit and vegetables, as well as the handling and processing of meats and dairy products. 
The institute also observes market behaviours of internal and external consume, as well as the economical impact of the different applied technologies.

==Organization==
The INTA has a directive board composed of members of both the official and the private sector; they define the politics at national level. 
The national direction executes the planning of the board, assisted by the organization and administration technical areas.

Research and producers' capacitation takes place in 44 experimental agricultural stations and 240 extension units around the country.

Newberry College has a diverse line-up in men's and women's sports including baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, football, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, volleyball, and wrestling. The college is a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] and the [[South Atlantic Conference]] (SAC). The school is famous for being on the losing end of a tilt against Furman University, in which Frank Selvy scored 100 points.

==Music program==
The music program at Newberry College has a history in vocal and instrumental performance dating back over 100 years, and a jazz band and marching band in existence since 1956. In 1956, a major turning point in the school's musical history took place, when respected military band leader and alumnus Charles "Chief" Pruitt organized the jazz band and the marching band after returning to the school to teach music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pruitt Obituary|url=http://genealogytrails.com/scar/newberry/pobits.htm|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Newberry College marching band, which has been in existence since that time, is one of the most unusual aspects of Newberry College's music program. Newberry is one of the smallest colleges in the country with a marching band, and it is the only Lutheran school in the country with a marching band.

Also in 1956, Pruitt hosted the first jazz festival at Newberry College. This jazz festival has since become a unique annual tradition at Newberry College, and is considered to be the second oldest jazz festival in the nation.

==V-12: Navy College Training Program==
In 1943, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox announced the start of a new college training program, the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]]. The program was designed to supplement the force of commissioned officers in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. Newberry College became one of 131 colleges and universities in the United States chosen to participate in the V-12 program.

On July 1, 1943, the first 325 cadets arrived on campus; they included both V-12 Cadets and V-5 Aviation Cadets.

The cadets attended classes for periods of one to six terms of 16 weeks. Work was planned so that each term was the equivalent of a normal college semester. The [[Navy]] handled the discipline of its cadets, directed the physical fitness program, provided military drills and cooperated with the College in the direction of the program.

During the 27 months the V-12 Program were a part of the college, over 1,000 cadets were assigned to Newberry. On October 31, 1945, the V-12 Unit was decommissioned and Newberry College returned to its civilian status.

==US Air Force ROTC Program==

From 1972 until 1976, the United States Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (Detachment 777) was established at Newberry.  Through this program, selected students were commissioned as second lieutenants in the USAF and many served distinguished careers in the service of their nation.  In addition to Det. 777, an Arnold Air Society and an Angel Flight program was also active during this period.

Due to the manning authorization of the Air Force following the Vietnam War, Detachment 777 of Newberry College was deactivated.

The '''Norwegian Institute for Social Research''' ({{lang-no|Institutt for samfunnsforskning}}, IFS) is a private [[social science]] [[research institute]] based in [[Oslo]], Norway.

It was founded in 1950 by [[Vilhelm Aubert]], [[Arne Næss]], [[Eirik Rinde]], and [[Stein Rokkan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.samfunnsforskning.no/page/About_ISF/Menu_About_ISF/7979/8038| title = History of the ISF| accessdate = 28 April 2007| last = Beer| first = Nicolai| date = | work = Institute for Social Research (official site)| publisher = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070803230017/http://www.samfunnsforskning.no/page/About_ISF/Menu_About_ISF/7979/8038 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 3 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It publishes the journal ''[[Tidsskrift for samfunnsforskning]]''.

The institute is divided into five research fields, each with its own research director. They are [[Bernt Aardal]] (Political institutions, voting and public opinion), [[Erling Barth]] (Employment and working conditions), Mari Teigen (Gender and society), Bernard Enjolras (Civil society in transition) and Hilde Lidén (International migration, integration and ethnic relations). In total, the institute has 52 employees.

'''Nuclear astrophysics''' is an interdisciplinary branch of physics involving close collaboration among researchers in various subfields of [[nuclear physics]] and [[astrophysics]]: notably [[Stellar structure|stellar modeling]]; measurement and theoretical estimation of [[nuclear reaction]] rates; physical [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]] and [[cosmochemistry]]; [[Gamma ray astronomy|gamma ray]], [[Optical astronomy|optical]] and [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] [[astronomy]]; and extending our knowledge about nuclear [[Half-life|lifetimes]] and masses.  In general terms, '''nuclear astrophysics''' aims ''to understand the origin of the [[chemical element]]s and the energy generation in [[stars]]''.

==History==
The basic principles for explaining the origin of elements and energy generation in stars appear in the theory of [[nucleosynthesis]], which came together in the late 1950s in [[B2FH|seminal works]] by Burbidge, Burbidge, [[William Alfred Fowler|Fowler]], and [[Fred Hoyle|Hoyle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date=1957  | author=E. M. Burbidge  | author2=G. R. Burbidge  | author3=W. A. Fowler  | author4=F. Hoyle.  | last-author-amp=yes  | title= Synthesis of the Elements in Stars | journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]] | volume=29 | issue=4 | page=547 | doi= 10.1103/RevModPhys.29.547 | bibcode=1957RvMP...29..547B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Alastair G. W. Cameron|Cameron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Stellar Evolution, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Nucleogenesis |url=https://fas.org/sgp/eprint/CRL-41.pdf |author=Cameron, A.G.W. |date=1957 |publisher=[[Atomic Energy of Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler is largely credited with initiating collaboration between astronomers, astrophysicists, and experimental nuclear physicists that we now know as '''nuclear astrophysics'''&lt;ref name="ENA"&gt;{{Citation | editor1-last  = Barnes | editor1-first = C.

N. | title  = Essays in Nuclear Astrophysics | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | publication-date = 1982 | isbn = 978-0-52128-876-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for which he won the 1983 Nobel Prize).

The basic tenets of '''nuclear astrophysics''' are that only isotopes of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] (and traces of lithium, [[beryllium]], and [[boron]]) can be formed in a homogeneous [[big bang]] model (see [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|big bang nucleosynthesis]]), while all other elements are formed in stars. Conversion of nuclear mass to radiative energy (per [[Einstein|Einstein's]] famous [[E=mc^2|mass-energy relation]]) is what allows stars to shine for up to billions of years. Many notable physicists of the 19th century such as [[Hans Ferdinand Mayer|Mayer]], Waterson, [[Helmholtz|von Helmholtz]], and [[Lord Kelvin]], postulated that the [[Sun]] radiates thermal energy by converting [[Gravitational potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|gravitational potential energy]] into [[heat]]. Under such a model, its lifetime can be calculated relatively easily using the [[virial theorem]] — around 19 million years, which was inconsistent with the interpretation of [[Geologic timescale|geological records]] and the (then new) theory of [[Evolution|biological evolution]]. A [[back-of-the-envelope]] calculation indicates that if the Sun consisted entirely of a [[fossil fuel]] like [[coal]] (a source of energy familiar to many), considering the rate of thermal energy emission, its lifetime would be merely four or five thousand years, which is not even consistent with records of [[Civilization|human civilization]]. Though now discredited, this hypothesis that the Sun's primary energy source is gravitational contraction was reasonable before the advent of [[modern physics]]; radioactivity itself was not discovered by [[Henri Becquerel|Becquerel]] until 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Henri Becquerel|title =Sur les radiations émises par phosphorescence|journal=[[Comptes Rendus]] |volume = 122| pages = 420–421|date=1896|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30780/f422.chemindefer}} See also [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/becquerel.html a translation by Carmen Giunta]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the prerequisite knowledge of the [[atomic nucleus]], a proper understanding of stellar energy is not possible without the theories of relativity and [[quantum mechanics]].

After [[Francis William Aston|Aston]] demonstrated that the mass of helium is less than four times that of the proton, [[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Eddington]] proposed that, through an unknown process in the Sun's core, hydrogen is transmuted into helium, liberating energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[The Observatory (journal)|The Observatory]] |volume=42 |pages=371–376 |date=1919 |last=Eddington |first=A. S. |title=The sources of stellar energy  |bibcode=1919Obs....42..371E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty years later, [[Hans Bethe|Bethe]] and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker|von Weizsäcker]] independently derived the [[CNO cycle|CN cycle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=C. F. |last=von Weizsäcker |authorlink=Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker |title=Über Elementumwandlungen in Innern der Sterne II |trans-title=Element Transformation Inside Stars, II |journal=[[Physikalische Zeitschrift]] |volume=39 |date=1938 |pages=633–646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=434–56 |date=1939 |last=Bethe |first=H. A. |authorlink=Hans Bethe |title=Energy Production in Stars |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=55 |issue=5 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRev.55.434 |bibcode=1939PhRv...55..434B}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first known nuclear reaction that accomplishes this transmutation. However, the Sun's primary energy source is now understood to be [[Proton–proton chain reaction|proton–proton chain reactions]], occurring at much lower energies and much more slowly than catalytic hydrogen fusion. The interval between Eddington's proposal and derivation of the CN cycle can mainly be attributed to an incomplete understanding of [[nuclear structure]]. A proper understanding of nucleosynthetic processes only came when [[James Chadwick|Chadwick]] discovered the [[neutron]] in 1932&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chadwick |first=James |date=1932 |title=Possible Existence of a Neutron |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=129 |issue=3252 |pages=312 |doi=10.1038/129312a0|bibcode = 1932Natur.129Q.312C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[beta decay]] theory developed. Nuclear physics gives a picture of the Sun's energy source producing a lifetime consistent with the age of the Solar System derived from [[Meteorite|meteoritic]] abundances of [[lead]] and [[uranium]] isotopes — about 4.5 billion years. The mass of stars like the Sun allow core hydrogen burning on the [[main sequence]] of the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]] via pp-chains for about 9 billion years. This primarily is determined by extremely slow production of deuterium,

Within this trend is a peak at abundances of iron and nickel, which is especially visible on a logarithmic graph spanning fewer powers of ten, say between logA=2 (A=100) and logA=6 (A=1,000,000).]]

==Predictions==
[[Stellar nucleosynthesis]] theory estimates chemical abundances consistent with those observed in the Solar System and galaxy, whose distribution spans twelve orders of magnitude (one trillion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date=1956  | author=Suess, Hans E.  | author2=Urey, Harold C.  | title= Abundances of the Elements | journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]] | volume=28 | issue=1 | page=53 | doi= 10.1103/RevModPhys.28.53 | bibcode=1956RvMP...28...53S}}&lt;/ref&gt; While impressive, these data were used to formulate the theory, but a [[scientific theory]] must be predictive to have merit.{{citation needed|reason=this claim belonging to philosophy of science needs a reference to philosophical source|date=April 2016}} The theory has been well-tested by observation and experiment since first formulated.

The theory predicts [[technetium]] (the lightest chemical element without stable isotopes) in stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] | volume=68 | issue=400 | pages=400 | date=1956  | author=P.W.

These observations have far-reaching implications. &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al has a lifetime a bit less than one million years, which is very short on a [[Galactic year|galactic timescale]], proving that nucleosynthesis is an ongoing process even in our own time. Work that led to discovery of [[neutrino oscillation]] (implying a non-zero mass for the neutrino absent in the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]]) was motivated by a solar neutrino flux about three times lower than expected — a long-standing concern in the nuclear astrophysics community colloquially known as [[Solar neutrino problem|the Solar neutrino problem]]. The observable neutrino flux from [[nuclear reactor]]s is much larger than that of the Sun, so Davis and others were primarily motivated to look for solar neutrinos for astronomical reasons.

{{expert|date=December 2011}}
'''Pedology''' ('''paidology''', '''paedology''') is the study of children's behavior and development (as distinct from [[pedagogy]], the art or science of teaching, and [[pediatrics]], the field of medicine relating to children). 

The origins of this trend in [[psychology]] and pedagogy go back to the end of the 18th century with the separation of a branch of psychology that would form the basis of pedagogy, a pedagogic psychology or "experimental pedagogic psychology", "experimental pedagogy", "experimental education". 

[[G. Stanley Hall]] (1844-1924) fostered pedology as a separate study, and also became instrumental in the development of modern [[educational psychology]].  An American researcher, [[Oscar Chrisman]], proposed the term "pedology" in 1893. At the end of the 19th century, pedology as a comprehensive study of the child came to prominence in Europe as an attempt to create a study of children in the manner of [[natural sciences]]. In 1909 Professor [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] organized a Pedological Society in [[Lviv]], [[Austro-Hungary]] (now Ukraine). In 1910 a similar society was organized in [[Kraków]]. In 1911 the first World Congress in Pedology took place in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], with attendants from 22 countries.

[[World War I]] (1914-1918) effectively put an end to the development of this study in Western Europe.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

Since pedology as a branch of science never reached its maturity, there is no common established understanding as to the scope or instruments of pedology. 

[[Bowie State University]] in Bowie, Maryland became the first university in the United States to offer a Bachelor's Degree in pedology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bowiestate.edu/academics/departments/behavioral/pedology/ | title=Pedology Major| publisher= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318204420/http://www.bowiestate.edu/academics/departments/behavioral/pedology// | archive-date=18 March 2008 | accessdate=11 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 document from the university refers to "the pedology major (now known as child and adolescent studies)".&lt;ref name="assessment"&gt;{{cite journal|work=Assessment Times|url=https://www.bowiestate.edu/files/resources/newsletter-fall-2014.pdf|publisher=Bowie State University|date=August 2014 | title=Faculty Spotlight: Behavioral, Health and Human Services|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pedology in the Soviet Union==
In [[Imperial Russia]] a prominent developer of the field was [[Aleksandr Petrovich Nechayev|Aleksandr Nechayev]] (Александр Петрович Нечаев) in [[St. Petersburg]], who in 1901 created the laboratory of experimental pedagogical psychology. Soviet pedology is traditionally thought to be founded by the efforts of [[Vladimir Bekhterev]]; in particular, in 1918 he founded the Institute of Pedology as part of psychological institutions united into the Institute for Study of Brain and Psychical Activity.

This science was intensively pursued in 1920s-1930s in the [[Soviet Union]]. A journal ''Pedologiya'' ("Педология") was issued.  [[Lev Vygotsky]] was one of its prominent supporters. 

While many works of pedologists were of considerable value, the approach was severely criticized for over-enthusiastic but poorly grounded approach of [[Test (student assessment)|testing]] for predicting a child's mental development, in addition to estimating its status. 

It was officially banned in 1936 after a special decree of [[VKP(b)]] [[Central Committee]] "On Pedological Perversions in the [[Narkompros]] System" on July 4, 1936 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/36976031/Russian_Federation_in_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_the_History_of_Psychology_Pt_1 | title=Russian Federation | archive-date=4 June 2018 | accessdate=4 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''political pensioner''' enjoys a [[pension]] awarded due to his or political career or significance.

== UK domestic politicians ==
{{outdated|section|date=September 2018}}
By the [[Political Offices Pension Act 1869]], pensions were instituted for those who had held political office. For the purposes of the act, political offices were divided into three classes:
# those with a yearly salary of not less than £5,000; 
# those with a salary of less than £5,000 and not less than £2,000;
# those with a salary of less than £2,000 and more than £1,000.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Pension |volume=21 |page=120 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For service in these offices there may be awarded pensions for life in the following scale: 
# a first class pension not exceeding £2,000 a year, in respect of not less than four years service or its equivalent, in an office of the first class; 
# a second class pension not exceeding £1,200, in respect of service of not less than six years or its equivalent, in an office of the second class; 
# a third class pension not exceeding £800 a year, in respect of service of not less than ten years in an office of the third class.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The service need not be continuous, and the act makes provision for counting service in lower classes as a qualification for pension in a higher class. These pensions are limited in number to twelve, but a holder must not receive any other pension out of the public revenue, if so, he must inform the treasury and surrender it if it exceeds his political pension, or if under he must deduct the amount. He may, however, hold office while a pensioner, but the pension is not payable during the time he holds office. To obtain a political pension, the applicant must file a declaration stating the grounds upon which he claims it and that his income from other sources is not sufficient to maintain his station in life.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

{{Princely states topics}}
These pensions were not awarded on grounds of justice, contract or socio-economic merits, but as a political decision, in order to take a politically significant person and/or his dynasty (often deemed a potential political danger) out of the picture by paying him or her off, regardless of seniority. 

In the history of the [[British Empire]], the term applies to the following overseas native former ruling houses of [[princely state]]s who saw their feudal territories annexed by the [[East India Company]] before it transferred power in [[British India]] to [[the Crown]] in 1858.

Although politically important members could be relocated or exiled, they retained throughout India and until the end of the [[British Raj|Raj]] a hereditary right to their former princely rank and titles (in several cases including a [[gun salute]]) as well as a monetary "political pension" in the form of a [[Privy Purse in India|privy purse]]. Only a few years after India's independence in 1947, the nationalist government of the Indian Union 'persuaded' most of these princely heirs to relinquish their annual pensions on so-called patriotic grounds. For those who continued to receive the payments, the sums were reduced to a pittance through not compensating for inflation.

Muslim pensioners :
* the imperial [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] family, [[Paramount ruler]] of India as [[Padshah-i-Hind]], in or near Delhi (pension discontinued after 1857)
* the heirs of its failed Muslim fundamentalist challenger, [[Tippu Sultan]]'s Mysore-based [[Khudadad]] empire 
* the [[Prince of Arcot]] (formerly Nawab Subadar of the Realm of the Carnatic)
* the [[Nawab of Awadh]] (Oudh), formerly the Mughal emperor's hereditary prime Minister 
* the Nawab of [[Kurnool]] 
* the [[Nawab of Masulipatam]], head of a younger branch of the [[nawabs of Banganapalle]]
* the [[Nawab of Murshidabad]] (in fact the dynasty of the former Nawab Nazim of greater [[Bengal]]; in West Bengal)
* the [[Nawab of Surat]]

Seven Hindu thrones, at least three held by the Rajput Bhonsle family :
* the Maharaja of [[Assam]] (not the whole present constitutive state) 
* the Maharaja of [[Nagpur]] 
* the Raja of [[Kolaba State|Kolaba]], Angria (Angre) dynasty
* the Raja of [[Satara State|Satara]], had even earlier lost all real power to his chief minister, the [[Peshwa]], who had become the hegemon of the [[Maratha Empire|Mahratta confederation]]
* the Raja of [[Tanjore]]
* the Raja of [[Kodagu|Coorg]] 
* the Peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy (pension discontinued 1857)

Only one Sikh pensioner : 
* [[Sikh Empire|Punjab]]'s last ruling Maharajah, [[Duleep Singh]].

== Other ==
Similar 'golden cage' arrangements were often made later by other (not only British) governments. An extreme case was the French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], for whom the Italian island of [[Elba]] was turned into an operetta 'empire' until his escape, Cent Jours revolt and miserable banishment to St. Helena.

[[Penguin]]s use stones for building their [[Bird nest|nests]]. Based on a 1998 study, media reports stated&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; that a shortage of stones led female Adélie penguins&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKee, Maggie (2005-01-02) [http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/National-Wildlife/Birds/Archives/2005/Mating-in-a-Material.aspx Mating in a Material World], [[National Wildlife Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt; to trade sex for stones. Some pair-bonded female penguins copulate with males who are not their mates and then take pebbles for their own nests.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Chimpanzees who appear to be trading food for sex have also been described as engaging in prostitution.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;

==Penguins==
{{see also|Adélie penguin}}
[[File:Manchot Adelie - Adelie Penguin.jpg|thumb|Adélie penguin]]
Prostitution in animals was first reported in 1998 by Fiona Hunter, a researcher at the [[University of Cambridge]], and Lloyd Davis of the [[University of Otago]], who had spent five years observing the mating behavior of Adélie penguins. The study was conducted as part of an [[Antarctica New Zealand]] programme on the [[Ross Island]], approximately {{convert|800|mi}} from the [[South Pole]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

According to the report about the study published by [[BBC News Online]], some female penguins sneak around on their partners.  These prostitutes have sex with unattached males and take a pebble from the male's nest after having sex. In an actual study the researchers speculate that the female has bent over to grab a stone and the male has misinterpreted the gesture—she hasn't changed her mind or performed a trick. But researchers are still studying the phenomenon, and a consensus has not yet been reached; it is assumed that either the female is baiting, or that the male deliberately chooses to misinterpret the gesture, as coercive sexual copulation is common among these penguins. The BBC further reported Hunter as saying that the female penguins probably didn't engage in prostitution only for stones. Hunter believed "what they are doing is having copulation for another reason and just taking the stones as well. We don't know exactly why, but they are using the males".  This behavior was also suggested as a [[mate choice]] process by which the females might find a possible future mate.  This would provide a female penguin with another male penguin should their current mate die. The male penguins, the study speculates, were engaged in sex with the prostitute females only for sexual satisfaction. According to Hunter's observation, the number of prostitute penguins was very low, and she approximated this as "only a few percent".&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

While the sensationalized versions of the study emphasize prostitution, the research data itself is less sensational. The data show that when extrapair copulation occurs at the male's nesting site, the female takes one or more stones; but when the extrapair copulation occurs at the female's nesting site, the male never takes a stone.  Clearly a male who has copulated with a female benefits his progeny when she takes a stone.  Sometimes copulation doesn't occur, but the female still takes a stone.  But both males and females steal stones: sometimes they get away with it and sometimes they are attacked.  The benefit of gaining stones without a fight is clear, but the female is not always willing to copulate to avoid a fight.  The researchers speculate about the possible genetic fitness advantages and disadvantages of the practice, and aren't altogether sure that the female copulates mainly in order to obtain a stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=E.M.|author2=Davis, S.L. |year=1998|title=Female Adélie Penguins Acquire Nest Material from Extrapair Males after Engaging in Extrapair Copulations |journal=The Auk|volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=526–528|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v115n02/p0526-p0528.pdf|doi=10.2307/4089218|jstor=4089218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chimpanzees==
[[File:Schimpanse zoo-leipig.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Pan troglodytes]]'', similar to those observed in the [[Taï National Park]].]]
A study conducted by the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]] in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]], and published online in the [[Public Library of Science]], attempted to support the meat-for-sex behaviour hypothesis, according to which, in early human societies the best male hunters had the maximum number of sexual partners. Unable to study early humans, researchers studied chimpanzees. Researchers observed chimpanzees in the [[Taï National Park]] and concluded that a form of prostitution exists among the chimpanzees in which females offer sex to males in exchange for meat. According to Cristina Gomes of the Institute, the study "strongly suggests that wild chimpanzees exchange meat for sex, and do so on a long-term basis".  The data reveal that chimps enter into communities of hunting and sharing meat with each other over long periods of time and females within the meat-sharing community tend to copulate with males of their own meat-sharing community.  Direct exchange of meat for sex has not been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cristina M. Gomes and Christophe Boesch |year=2009 |title=Wild Chimpanzees Exchange Meat for Sex on a Long-Term Basis |journal=PLOS ONE |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005116 |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=e5116 |pmid=19352509 |pmc=2663035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capuchin monkeys==
[[File:Capuchin Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|Capuchin monkey]]
A study at [[Yale–New Haven Hospital]] trains [[capuchin monkey]]s to use silver discs as money in order to study their economic behavior. The discs could be exchanged by the monkeys for various treats. During one chaotic incident, a researcher observed what appeared to be a monkey exchanging a disc for sex. The monkey that was paid for sex immediately traded the silver disc for a grape. The researcher took steps to prevent any possibility of coins being traded for sex after his suspicions were aroused.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/magazine/05FREAK.html  Monkey Business], by [[Stephen J.

'''''Rethinking "Gnosticism": An Argument for Dismantling a Dubious Category''''', is a 1996 book by Michael Allen Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Michael allen|title=Rethinking "Gnosticism:" An Argument for Dismantling a Dubious Category|date=1996|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-01127-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is one of the first critical works that goes about comparing the established academic definitions of [[gnosticism]] to the texts discovered at [[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi]]. The main points of the book are that there is no established definition of "gnosticism" by people who use the term, let alone the academic world; and that the groups referred to as "gnostic" by the [[Christian]] Church [[apologist]]s referred to themselves often by their leader or leaders' names but no group referred to themselves as "gnostic" or "gnostics".

Also, Williams mentions the [[argument]] that none of the groups labeled "gnostic" shared a common set of beliefs that put them in a group together. The only things close to this would be the Christian [[heresiographical]] use of referring to these varied groups as "gnostics". As well as the varied set of interruptions of the creator of the material world ([[Yahweh]] or [[demiurge]]) by these early groups. Finally Williams clarifies that the ancient "gnosticism" of the Nag Hammadi groups and the misused "gnosticism" of moderns groups and academia have little if anything in common. Williams suggests a better and more adequate term for these [[heresy|heretical]] groups would be "biblical [[demiurge|demiurgical]] traditions".

'''Ride height''' (also called '''ground clearance''' or simply '''clearance''') is the amount of space between the base of an automobile [[tire]] and the lowest point (typically the axle); or, more properly, to the shortest distance between a flat, level surface, and the lowest part of a vehicle other than those parts designed to contact the ground (such as tires, tracks, skis, etc.). Ground clearance is measured with standard vehicle equipment, and for cars, is usually given with no cargo or passengers.

[[File:Ford F-250 lifted.jpg|thumb|[[Ford Super Duty#Third generation (2011–present)|Ford F-250]] with aftermarket suspension modifications to increase ride height]]
Ground clearance is a critical factor in several important characteristics of a vehicle. For all vehicles, especially cars, variations in clearance represent a trade-off between [[Automobile handling|handling]] and practicality. A higher ground clearance means that the center of mass of the car is higher, which makes for less precise and more dangerous handling characteristics (most notably, the chance of [[rollover]] is higher). However, it also means that the car is more capable of being driven on roads that are not level, without the road scraping against and likely damaging the chassis and underbody. Higher ride heights will typically adversely affect [[aerodynamic]] properties. This is why [[sports car]]s typically have very low clearances, while [[off-road vehicle]]s and [[SUV]]s have higher ones. Two well-known extremes of each are the [[Ferrari F40]] and the [[Hummer]].

For [[armored fighting vehicle]]s (AFV), ground clearance presents an additional factor in a vehicle's overall performance: a lower ground clearance means that the vehicle minus the [[chassis]] is lower to the ground and thus harder to spot and harder to hit. The final design of any AFV reflects a compromise between being a smaller target on one hand, and having greater battlefield mobility on the other. Very few AFVs have top speeds at which car-like handling becomes an issue, though rollovers can and do occur. By contrast, an AFV is far more likely to need high ground clearance than a road vehicle.

[[File:Lowered BMW M3.jpg|thumb|BMW E46 "stanced" using aftermarket suspension kit]]
Lowering a car's [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] is a common and relatively inexpensive aftermarket modification. Many people prefer the more aggressive look of a lowered body{{According to whom|date=October 2017}}, and there is an easily realized [[car handling]] improvement from the lower center of gravity. Most passenger cars are produced such that one or two inches of lowering won't increase the probability of damage significantly. On most automobiles, ride height is modified by changing the length of the suspension [[Spring (device)|springs]], and is the essence of many aftermarket suspension kits supplied by manufacturers such as [[Eibach Federn|Eibach]] and [[H&amp;R (automotive manufacturer)|H&amp;R]].

Some cars have used [[underslung frame]]s to achieve a lower ride height and the consequent improvement in center of gravity. The brass-era cars of the [[American Motor Car Company]] are one example.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/113_0606_25_dodge_roadster/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-leveling suspension]] systems are designed to maintain a constant ride height regardless of load. Vehicles not equipped with self-leveling will pitch down at one end when laden; this adversely affects ride, handling, and aerodynamic properties.

Some modern automobiles (such as Audi's [[Audi Allroad Quattro|Allroad Quattro]]) have [[height adjustable suspension|adjustable suspension systems]], which can vary the ride height by locating the suspension mounting points, depending on road conditions and/or the settings selected by the driver.

Other, simpler suspension systems, such as [[coilover]] springs, offer a way of manually adjusting ride height (and often, spring stiffness) by compressing the spring [[in situ]], using a threaded shaft and adjustable knob or nut.

[[Image:MUTCD W10-5.svg|100px|thumb|right|[[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices|MUTCD]] warning sign for a [[Level  crossing|low-ground-clearance crossing]]]] 18-wheel [[tractor-trailers]] also have to take the ground clearance of both their tractor and especially trailer into consideration on certain areas of uneven terrain, such as raised [[Level crossing|railroad crossings]]. Their extremely long [[wheelbase]] means that such terrain could potentially catch the undercarriage of the trailer in the wide space between the axles, potentially leaving the truck stuck with no means to extricate itself.

In some areas buses are required to have a ground clearance of at least {{convert|100|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090522222432/http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/pdfs/freight/code_conduct_buses.pdf "Code of Practice for Buses", section 3.2: Ground Clearance]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Too much ride height can cause the vehicle to have a higher center of gravity, which could cause the vehicle to be unstable, or even flip.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8796">:''This article is about pouring concrete in moving forms. See [[Slipform stonemasonry]] for another type of slip forming, and [[Slipcasting]] for manufacture of ceramic vessels.''

'''Slip forming''', '''continuous poured''', '''continuously formed''', or '''slipform construction''' is a construction method in which [[concrete]] is poured into a continuously moving form.&lt;ref name="Nawy33"&gt;Nawy, ''Concrete Construction Engineering Handbook,'' 2008, p. 10—33.&lt;/ref&gt;  Slip forming is used for tall structures (such as bridges, towers, buildings, and dams), as well as horizontal structures, such as roadways.   Slipforming enables continuous, non-interrupted, cast-in-place "flawless" (i.e. no joints) concrete structures which have superior performance characteristics to piecewise construction using discrete form elements. Slip forming relies on the quick-setting properties of concrete, and requires a balance between quick-setting capacity and workability. Concrete needs to be workable enough to be placed into the form and consolidated (via vibration), yet quick-setting enough to emerge from the form with strength. This strength is needed because the freshly set concrete must not only permit the form to "slip" by the concrete without disturbing it, but also support the pressure of the new concrete as well as resist collapse caused by the vibration of the compaction machinery.

In '''vertical slip forming''' the concrete form may be surrounded by a platform on which workers stand, placing steel reinforcing rods into the concrete and ensuring a smooth pour.&lt;ref name="Balti" /&gt; Together, the concrete form and working platform are raised by means of hydraulic jacks.&lt;ref&gt;Nawy, ''Concrete Construction Engineering Handbook,'' 2008, p. 10—34.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the slipform rises at a rate which permits the concrete to harden by the time it emerges from the bottom of the form.&lt;ref name="Nawy33" /&gt;

In '''horizontal slip forming''' for pavement and traffic separation walls concrete is laid down, vibrated, worked, and settled in place while the form itself slowly moves ahead. This method was initially devised and utilized in [[Interstate Highway]] construction initiated by the Eisenhower administration during the 1950s.

== History ==
The slip forming technique was in use by the early 20th century for building silos and [[grain elevators]]. James MacDonald, of MacDonald Engineering of Chicago was the pioneer in utilizing slip form concrete for construction. His concept of placing circular bins in clusters was patented, with photographs and illustrations, contained in a 1907 book, “The Design Of Walls, Bins, And Grain Elevators”.&lt;ref&gt;
“The Design Of Walls, Bins, And Grain Elevators”. By Milo Smith Ketchum, The Engineering News Publishing Co.,1907, page 294. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iQ6AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA295&amp;lpg=PA295&amp;dq=macdonald+engineering+chicago&amp;source=web&amp;ots=fx4IDC8rnq&amp;sig=uq7lJCuegr4E0cJE9G_Pd+engineering+bbOQt_w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=macdonald%20engineering%20chicago&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1910, MacDonald published a paper “Moving Forms for Reinforced Concrete Storage Bins,” &lt;ref&gt;James MacDonald - “Moving Forms for Reinforced Concrete Storage Bins.” Proceedings of the Seventh Annual Convention Held at N.Y., N.Y. Volume 7, By National Association of Cement Users (U.S.). December 12–20, 1910. page 554.[https://books.google.com/books?id=5XE6AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA544&amp;lpg=PA544&amp;dq=JAMES+MACDONALD+mOVING+FORMS+FOR+REINFORCED+CONCRETE&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UELx9ZWp65&amp;sig=CMssrxDov2t8KobG_EmVAMPkZvI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JW-zUuGwBuW4yAH4yIHwDQ&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; describing the use of molds for moving forms, using jacks and concrete to form a continuous structure without joints or seams. This paper details the concept and procedure for creating slip form concrete structures. On May 24, 1917, a patent was issued to James MacDonald of Chicago, "for a device to move and elevate a concrete form in a vertical plane".&lt;ref&gt;Official gazette of the United States Patent Office, By United States. Patent Office Volume CCXXXVII. April 24, 1917, page 943.[https://books.google.com/books?id=DngbAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA943&amp;lpg=PA943&amp;dq=patent+james+MAcDoNALD+ON+MoviNG+FoRMS+FOR+CoNCRETE.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dxVLhk6m3N&amp;sig=wzgFs1BLLZuEctXyNXicGxiQAnA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3nKzUp_HL6KGyAG9_IGYDg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=patent%20james%20MAcDoNALD%20ON%20MoviNG%20FoRMS%20FOR%20CoNCRETE.&amp;f=false ]&lt;/ref&gt;

James MacDonald’s bin and silo design was utilized around the world into the late 1970s by MacDonald Engineering. In the 1947-1950 period, MacDonald Engineering constructed over 40 concrete towers using the slip-form method for [[AT&amp;T Long Lines]]&lt;ref name="Concrete_Towers"&gt;[http://long-lines.net/tech-equip/radio/concrete_towers.html] The Concrete Microwave Towers of AT&amp;T's First Transcontinental Radio Route&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; up to 191&amp;nbsp;ft tall for microwave relay stations across the United States. [[Image:ValpoTower1.JPG|thumb|upright|AT&amp;T Long Lines relay tower in Indiana constructed with the slip-form method.]]

The former LandMark Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas was constructed in 1961 by MacDonald Engineering as a subcontractor, utilizing Macdonald’s concept of slip form concrete construction to build the 31 story reinforced steel tower.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=504911682882727&amp;set=pb.206283149412250.-2207520000.1387564203.&amp;type=3&amp;theater Construction of tower for the LandMark Hotel/Casino, Las Vegas]&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique was introduced to residential and commercial buildings in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="Balti"&gt;"'Slip Forming' Technique Introduced in Baltimore." ''Washington Post.'' May 1, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Its first uses in high-rise buildings in the United States was on the shear wall supported apartment building at Turk &amp; Eddy Streets in San Francisco, CA, in 1962, built by the San Francisco office of Macdonald Engineering. The first notable use of the method in a residential/retail business was the [[Skylon Tower]] in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], which was completed in 1965.  Another unusual structure was the tapered buttress structures for the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1969. Another shear wall supported structure was the Casa Del Mar Condominium on Key Biscayne, Miami, FL in 1970.

From the 1950s, the vertical technique was adapted to mining head frames, ventilation structures, below grade shaft lining, and coal train loading silos; theme and communication tower construction; high rise office building cores; shear wall supported apartment buildings; tapered stacks and [[intake tower|hydro intake structures]], etc. It is used for structures which would otherwise not be possible, such as the separate legs of the [[Troll A platform|Troll A]] deep sea oil drilling platform which stands on the sea floor in water about 1000 feet (300 m) deep, has an overall height of &lt;!--{{m to ft|472}} --&gt;472 meters (1,549&amp;nbsp;ft), weighs 656,000 tons, and has the distinction of being the tallest structure ever moved ([[Towing|towed]]) by mankind.

In addition to the typical silos and shear walls and cores in buildings, the system is used for lining underground shafts and surge tanks in hydroelectric generating facilities. The technique was utilized to build the [[Inco Superstack]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], and the [[CN Tower]] in [[Toronto]]. In 2010, the technique was used to build the core of the supertall [[Shard London Bridge]] tower in London, England.

'''Socioscientific Issues (SSI)''' are controversial social issues which relate to science.&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D.L. &amp; Keefer, M. (2003). The role of moral reasoning and the status of socioscientific issues in science education: Philosophical, psychological and pedagogical considerations. In D.L. Zeidler (Ed.), The role of moral reasoning on socioscientific issues and discourse in science education. The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Press. (pp. 7-38)&lt;/ref&gt; They are ill-structured, open-ended problems which have multiple solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T.D. (2004). Informal reasoning regarding socioscientific issues: A critical review of research. Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 41, 513-536&lt;/ref&gt;

SSI are utilized in [[science education]] in order to promote [[scientific literacy]], which emphasizes the ability to apply scientific and moral reasoning to real-world situations.  Some examples of SSI include issues such as [[genetic engineering]], [[climate change]], [[animal testing]] for medical purposes, oil drilling in national parks, and "fat taxes" on "unhealthy" foods, among many others.  Research studies have shown SSI to be effective at increasing students' understanding of science in various contexts, [[Argumentation theory|argumentation skills]], [[empathy]], and [[Moral philosophy|moral reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T. D., &amp; Zeidler, D. L. (2005). The significance of content knowledge for informal reasoning regarding socioscientific issues: Applying genetics knowledge to genetic engineering issues. Science Education, 89(1), 71-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D. L., &amp; Sadler, T. D. (2008). The role of moral reasoning in argumentation: Conscience, character and care. In S. Erduran &amp; M. Pilar Jimenez-Aleixandre (Eds.), Argumentation in science education: Perspectives from classroom-based research (pp. 201-216). The Netherlands: Springer Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals of SSI ==
Supporters of SSI argue that it can:
* 1) Cultivate a scientifically literate citizens who are able to apply evidence-based scientific content knowledge to real-world socioscientific scenarios;
* 2) Foster a collective [[social conscience]] whereby students consistently reflect upon the formation and implications of their own reasoning;
* 3) Encourage [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]] skills that are essential for thinking and reasoning processes and mirror the types of discourse utilized in real-world scientific deliberations;
* 4) Promote [[critical thinking]] skills, such as analysis, inference, explanation,
evaluation, interpretation, and self-regulation&lt;ref&gt;Facione, P. A. (2007). Critical thinking: What it is and why it counts (2007 update). Millbrae, CA: Insight Assessment/California Academic Press LLC. Retrieved April 28, 2009, from www.insightassessment.com/pdf_files/what&amp;why2006. pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Science educators often refer to all of these aspects together as,"functional scientific literacy."&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D. L., Sadler, T. D., Simmons, M. L., &amp; Howes, E. V. (2005). Beyond STS: A research-based framework for socioscientific issues education. Science Education, 89(3), 357-377.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical Context of SSI ==

=== Scientific Literacy - Vision I and II ===
Scientific literacy has been defined by two competing visions. A Vision I approach to scientific literacy is characterized by content-driven, decontextualized science knowledge.  A Vision II approach to scientific literacy is a context-driven, student-centered approach which seeks to prepare students for informed [[civic engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, D.A. (2007). Scientific literacy / science literacy. In S.K. Abell &amp; N.G. Lederman (Eds.), Handbook of research on science education (pp. 729-780). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  The SSI framework follows a Vision II approach as it is believed to provide an opportunity for contextualized learning of science content as well as an opportunity for moral development.

=== SSI Distinguished from Science, Technology, and Society (STS) ===
SSI is conceptually related to [[Science, technology and society|Science, Technology, and Society]] (STS) education.  However, while both approaches connect science to societal issues, SSI is distinguished from STS because of its emphasis on the development of character and virtue as well as content knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeidler|first=D.|author2=Sadler, T.D. |author3=Simmons, M.L. |author4=Howes, E.V. |title=Beyond STS: A Research-Based|journal=Science Education|year=2005|volume=89|issue=3|pages=357–377|doi=10.1002/sce.20048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SSI and Moral Reasoning ==
Research suggests that SSI creates [[cognitive dissonance]] by compelling students to consider claims that may be at odds with their own beliefs and values.&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D.L. &amp; Nichols, B.H. (2009). Socioscientific Issues: Theory and Practice. Journal of Elementary Science Education, 21, 2, 49-58&lt;/ref&gt; Dissonance of this nature is believed by some to advance [[moral reasoning]] by ‘empowering students to consider how science based issues and the decisions made concerning them reflect, in part, the moral principles and qualities of [[virtue]] that encompass their own lives, as well as the physical and social world around them.'&lt;ref&gt;
Zeidler, D. L., Sadler, T. D., Simmons, M. L., &amp; Howes, E. V. (2005). Beyond STS: A research-based framework for socioscientific issues education. Science Education, 89(3), 357-377, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Supporting SSI ==
SSI education has been [[empirically]] investigated and linked to particular outcomes including:
• Promoting developmental changes in reflective judgment;&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D., Sadler, T., Applebaum, S., &amp; Callahan, B. (2009). Advancing reflective
judgment through socioscientific issues. Journal of Research in Science Teaching,

• Engage students’ interest in the [[Inquiry-based science|inquiry of science]].

More recently, SSI research has been focused on cross-cultural comparisons and research has reflected international partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, H.; Chang, H., Choi, K., Kim, S., Zeidler, D.L. (2011). "Developing Character and Values for Global Citizens: Analysis of pre-service science". International Journal of Science Education: 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hypothesized by some that more advanced stages of epistemological reasoning allows individuals to apply a kind of socioscientific reasoning (SSR)&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T.D., Barab, S.A. and Scott, B. 2006. What do students gain by engaging in socio‐scientific inquiry?. Research in Science Education, 37: 371–391.&lt;/ref&gt; akin to scientific habits of mind. SSR is a theoretical construct that entails the ability to tap key traits while negotiating SSI. These include [[skepticism]], [[complexity]], [[multiple perspective]] and [[inquiry]].

== SSI in the Classroom ==

Teachers utilize SSI to foster understanding of science content and consequences involved in everyday scientific issues.  For example, in a study of [[ecology]], an elementary class might consider whether pesticides confer more benefit or harm to our ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, C., &amp; Davis, E. A. (2008a). Exploring preservice elementary teachers’ critique and adaptation of science curriculum materials in respect to socioscientific issues. Science and Education, 17(8–9),829–854.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of analysis would require students to research the interractions between organisms in food webs and food chains, as well as the human impacts of pesticides. Students could make [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based decisions]] and discuss them through various means including whole-class discussions, [[debates]], [[discussion boards|online discussion boards]], etc... Similarly, older grades might consider issues such as whether [[genetic engineering]] should be used to treat genetic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T. D., &amp; Zeidler, D. L. (2004). Negotiating gene therapy controversies. The
American Biology Teacher, 66, 428–433.&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of analysis would require extensive study of genetics and modern genetic engineering techniques, as well as the ethical issues involved in [[personal freedom]]s, religious prohibitions on intervention, and so on.  Advocates suggest that, through evidence-based [[discourse]], students learn to formulate their own informed decisions and understand those whose views differ from themselves.  An essential aspect of the implementation of SSI is that the teacher is not promoting any particular belief; rather, the teacher's role is to promote evidence-based critical thinking and argumentation.

The '''stochastic empirical loading and dilution model''' ('''SELDM''')&lt;ref name ="SELDM-Manual"&gt;Granato, G.E., 2013, Stochastic empirical loading and dilution model (SELDM) version 1.0.0: U.S. Geological Survey Techniques and Methods, book 4, chap. C3, 112 p. http://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/04/c03/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granato, G.E., 2014, SELDM: Stochastic Empirical Loading and Dilution Model version 1.0.3 Software support page available at https://doi.org/10.5066/F7TT4P3G&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[stormwater]] quality model. SELDM is designed to transform complex scientific data into meaningful information about the risk of adverse effects of runoff on receiving waters, the potential need for mitigation measures, and the potential effectiveness of such management measures for reducing these risks. The [[U.S. Geological Survey]] developed SELDM in cooperation with the [[Federal Highway Administration]] to help develop planning-level estimates of event mean concentrations, flows, and loads in stormwater from a site of interest and from an upstream basin. SELDM uses information about a highway site, the associated receiving-water basin, precipitation events, stormflow, water quality, and the performance of mitigation measures to produce a stochastic population of runoff-quality variables. Although SELDM is, nominally, a highway runoff model is can be used to estimate flows concentrations and loads of runoff-quality constituents from other land use areas as well. SELDM was developed by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] so the model, source code, and all related documentation are provided free of any copyright restrictions according to U.S. copyright laws and the USGS Software User Rights Notice.

SELDM is a [[stochastic]] mass-balance model&lt;ref&gt;Di Toro, D.M., 1984, Probability model of stream quality due to runoff: Journal of Environmental Engineering, v. 110, no. 3, p. 607–628.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warn, A.E., and Brew, J.S., 1980, Mass balance: Water Research, v. 14, p. 1427–1434.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, S.S., and Naiman, D.Q., 1999, Bias and variance of planning-level estimates of pollutant loads: Water Resources Research, v. 35, no. 11, p. 3475–3487.&lt;/ref&gt; A mass-balance approach (figure 1) is commonly applied to estimate the concentrations and loads of water-quality constituents in receiving waters downstream of an urban or highway-runoff outfall. In a mass-balance model, the loads from the upstream basin and runoff source area are added to calculate the discharge, concentration, and load in the receiving water downstream of the discharge point.

[[File:SchematicStochasticMassBalanceDiagram.png|thumb|500px|right|Figure 1. Schematic diagram showing the stochastic mass-balance approach for estimating stormflow, concentration, and loads of water-quality constituents upstream of a highway-runoff outfall, from the highway, and downstream of the outfall]]

SELDM can do a stream-basin analysis and a lake-basin analysis. The stream-basin analysis uses a stochastic mass-balance analysis based on multi-year simulations including hundreds to thousands of runoff events. SELDM generates storm-event values for the site of interest (the highway site) and the upstream receiving stream to calculate flows, concentrations, and loads in the receiving stream downstream of the stormwater outfall. The lake-basin analysis also is a stochastic multi-year mass-balance analysis. The lake-basin analysis uses the highway loads that occur during runoff periods, the total annual loads from the lake basin to calculate annual loads to and from the lake. The lake basin analysis uses the volume of the lake and pollutant-specific attenuation factors to calculate a population of average-annual lake concentrations.

The annual flows and loads SELDM calculates for the stream and lake analyses also can be used to estimate [[total maximum daily load]]s (TMDLs) for the site of interest and the upstream lake basin. The TMDL can be based on the average of annual loads because product of the average load times the number of years of record will be the sum-total load for that (simulated) period of record. The variability in annual values can be used to estimate the risk of exceedance and the margin of safety for the TMDL analysis

==Model description==
SELDM is a stochastic model because it uses [[Monte Carlo methods]] to produce the random combinations of input variable values needed to generate the stochastic population of values for each component variable. SELDM calculates the dilution of runoff in the receiving waters and the resulting downstream event mean concentrations and annual average lake concentrations. Results are ranked, and plotting positions are calculated, to indicate the level of risk of adverse effects caused by runoff concentrations, flows, and loads on receiving waters by storm and by year. Unlike deterministic hydrologic models, SELDM is not calibrated by changing values of input variables to match a historical record of values. Instead, input values for SELDM are based on site characteristics and representative statistics for each hydrologic variable. Thus, SELDM is an [[empirical]] model based on data and statistics rather than theoretical physicochemical equations.

SELDM is a [[lumped parameter model]] because the highway site, the upstream basin, and the lake basin each are represented as a single homogeneous unit. Each of these source areas is represented by average basin properties, and results from SELDM are calculated as point estimates for the site of interest. Use of the lumped parameter approach facilitates rapid specification of model parameters to develop planning-level estimates with available data. The approach allows for parsimony in the required inputs to and outputs from the model and flexibility in the use of the model. For example, SELDM can be used to model runoff from various land covers or land uses by using the highway-site definition as long as representative water quality and impervious-fraction data are available.

SELDM is easy to use because it has a simple graphical user interface and because much of the information and data needed to run SELDM are embedded in the model.&lt;ref name ="SELDM-Manual" /&gt; SELDM provides input statistics for precipitation, prestorm flow, runoff coefficients, and concentrations of selected water-quality constituents from National datasets. Input statistics may be selected on the basis of the latitude, longitude, and physical characteristics of the site of interest and the upstream basin. The user also may derive and input statistics for each variable that are specific to a given site of interest or a given area. Information and data from hundreds to thousands of sites across the country were compiled to facilitate use of SELDM.&lt;ref&gt;Granato, G.E., and Cazenas, P.A., 2009, Highway-Runoff Database (HRDB Version 1.0)--A data warehouse and preprocessor for the stochastic empirical loading and dilution model: Washington, D.C., U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, FHWA-HEP-09-004, 57 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granato, G.E., Carlson, C.S., and Sniderman, B.S., 2009, Methods for development of planning-level stream-water-quality estimates at unmonitored sites in the conterminous United States: Washington, D.C., U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, FHWA-HEP-09-003, 53 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granato, G.E., 2010, Methods for development of planning-level estimates of stormflow at unmonitored sites in the conterminous United States: Washington, D.C., U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, FHWA-HEP-09-005, 90 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, K.P., and Granato, G.E., 2010, Quality of stormwater runoff discharged from Massachusetts highways, 2005–07: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2009–5269, 198 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the necessary input data are obtained by defining the location of the site of interest and five simple basin properties. These basin properties are the drainage area, the basin length, the basin slope, the impervious fraction, and the basin development factor&lt;ref name ="SELDM-Manual" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granato, G.E., 2012, Estimating basin lagtime and hydrograph-timing indexes used to characterize stormflows for runoff-quality analysis: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2012–5110, 47 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stricker, V.A., and Sauer, V.B., 1982, Techniques for estimating flood hydrographs for ungaged urban watersheds: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 82–365, 24 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

SELDM models the potential effect of mitigation measures by using Monte Carlo methods with statistics that approximate the net effects of structural and nonstructural best management practices (BMPs). Structural BMPs are defined as the components of the drainage pathway between the source of runoff and a stormwater discharge location that affect the volume, timing, or quality of runoff. SELDM uses a simple stochastic statistical model of BMP performance to develop planning-level estimates of runoff-event characteristics. This statistical approach can be used to represent a single BMP or an assemblage of BMPs. The SELDM BMP-treatment module has provisions for stochastic modeling of three stormwater treatments: volume reduction, hydrograph extension, and water-quality treatment. In SELDM, these three treatment variables are modeled by using the [[trapezoidal distribution]]&lt;ref&gt;Kacker, R.N., and Lawrence, J.F., 2007, Trapezoidal and triangular distributions for Type B evaluation of standard uncertainty: Metrologia, v. 44, no. 2, p. 117–127.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[rank correlation]]&lt;ref&gt;Helsel, D.R., and Hirsch, R.M., 2002, Statistical methods in water resources—Hydrologic analysis and interpretation: U.S. Geological Survey Techniques of Water-Resources Investigations, book 4, chap. A3, 510 p.&lt;/ref&gt; with the associated highway-runoff variables. This report describes methods for calculating the trapezoidal-distribution statistics and rank correlation coefficients for stochastic modeling of volume reduction, hydrograph extension, and water-quality treatment by structural stormwater BMPs and provides the calculated values for these variables. These statistics are different from the statistics commonly used to characterize or compare BMPs. They are designed to provide a stochastic transfer function to approximate the quantity, duration, and quality of BMP effluent given the associated inflow values for a population of storm events.

==Model interface==
SELDM was developed as a [[Microsoft Access]]® database software application to facilitate storage, handling, and use of the hydrologic dataset with a simple [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).&lt;ref name ="SELDM-Manual"/&gt; The program's menu-driven GUI uses standard Microsoft [[Visual Basic for Applications]]® (VBA) interface controls to facilitate entry, processing, and output of data. Appendix 4 of the SELDM manual&lt;ref name ="SELDM-Manual"/&gt; has detailed instructions for using the GUI.

The SELDM user interface has one or more GUI forms that are used to enter four categories of input data, which include documentation, site and region information, hydrologic statistics, and water-quality data. The documentation data include information about the analyst, the project, and the analysis. The site and region data include the highway-site characteristics, the [[ecoregions]], the upstream-basin characteristics, and, if a lake analysis is selected, the lake-basin characteristics. The hydrologic data include precipitation, streamflow, and runoff-coefficient statistics. The water-quality data include highway-runoff-quality statistics, upstream-water-quality statistics, downstream-water-quality definitions, and BMP-performance statistics. There also is a GUI form for running the model and accessing the distinct set of output files. The SELDM interface is designed to populate the database with data and statistics for the analysis and to specify index variables that are used by the program to query the database when SELDM is run. It is necessary to step through the input forms each time an analysis is run.

==Model output==
The results of each SELDM analysis are written to 5–10 output files, depending on the options that were selected during the analysis-specification process. The five output files that are created for every model run are the output documentation, highway-runoff quality, annual highway runoff, precipitation events, and stormflow file. If the Stream Basin or Stream and Lake Basin output options are selected, then the prestorm streamflow and dilution factor files also are created. If these same two output options are selected and, in addition, one or more downstream water-quality pairs are defined by using the water-quality menu, then the upstream water-quality and downstream water-quality output files also are created by SELDM. If the Stream and Lake Basin Output or Lake Basin Output option is selected, and one or more downstream water-quality pairs are defined by using the water-quality menu, then the Lake Analysis output file is created when the Lake Basin Analysis is run. The output files are written as [[tab-delimited]] [[ASCII]] text files in a [[relational database]] (RDB) format that can be imported into many software packages. This output is designed to facilitate post-modeling analysis and presentation of results.

The benefit of the Monte Carlo analysis is not to decrease uncertainty in the input statistics, but to represent the different combinations of the variables that determine potential risks of water-quality excursions. SELDM provides a method for rapid assessment of information that is otherwise difficult or impossible to obtain because it models the interactions among hydrologic variables (with different probability distributions) that result in a population of values that represent likely long-term outcomes from runoff processes and the potential effects of different mitigation measures. SELDM also provides the means for rapidly doing sensitivity analyses to determine the potential effects of different input assumptions on the risks for water-quality excursions. SELDM produces a population of storm-event and annual values to address the questions about the potential frequency, magnitude, and duration of water-quality excursions. The output represents a collection of random events rather than a time series. Each storm that is generated in SELDM is identified by sequence number and annual-load accounting year. The model generates each storm randomly; there is no serial correlation, and the order of storms does not reflect seasonal patterns. The annual-load accounting years, which are just random collections of events generated with the sum of storm interevent times less than or equal to a year, are used to generate annual highway flows and loads for TMDL analysis and the lake basin analysis.

==History==
SELDM was developed between 2010 and 2013 and was published as version 1.0.0 in March 2013. A small problem with the [[algorithm]] used to calculate upstream and lake-basin transport curves was discovered and version 1.0.1 was released in July 2013. Version 1.0.2 was released in June, 2016 to use the Cunnane plotting position formula for all output files. Version 1.0.3 was released in July, 2018 to address issues with load calculations for constituents with concentrations of nanograms per liter or picograms per liter and to address other sundry issues. The code for SELDM is [[open source]] and [[public domain]] code that can be downloaded from the SELDM software support page.

The phrase '''sustainable industries''' is related to the development of [[industry|industrial]] processes in a [[sustainability|sustainable]] way.

== History ==
The earliest mention of the phrase "sustainable industries" appeared in 1990 in a story about a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] group [[Reforestation|reforesting]] a [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical forest]] to help create sustainable industries for the local populace.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, Bill. "Our Troubled Earth – Japan." ''The Seattle Times.'' November 13, 1990. Page F-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, a study entitled “Jobs in a Sustainable Economy” by Michael Renner of the [[Worldwatch Institute]] was published, using the term "sustainable industries".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Renner, [http://www.worldwatch.org/node/886 “Jobs in a Sustainable Economy”]. Worldwatch Institute #104 (September 1991). {{ISBN|1-878071-05-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 1991 report concluded, "Contrary to the jobs-versus-owls rhetoric that blames environmental restrictions for layoffs, the movement toward an environmentally sustainable [[World economy|global economy]] will create far more jobs than it eliminates. The chief reason: non-[[Pollution|polluting]], environmentally sustainable industries tend to be intrinsically more labour intensive and less resource intensive than traditional processes."  Among the features of sustainable industry offered in the paper were [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], resource conservation to meet the needs of future generations, safe and skill-enhancing working conditions, [[Waste minimisation|low waste production]] processes, and the use of safe and environmentally compatible materials. Some of the benefits, however would be offset by higher prices (due to labor costs) and a theoretically larger population needed to perform the same amount of work, increasing the [[Agriculture|agricultural]] and other loads on the system.

In February 2003 the business magazine Sustainable Industries was first published, offering news and analysis of core industries such as [[clean energy]] and [[green building]]. By 2012 the company had expanded to include digital media and event production with the Sustainable Industries Economic Forum in the U.S. Sustainable Industries merged with Triple Pundit in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.triplepundit.com/2011/10/triplepundit-sustainable-industries/ Big News: TriplePundit.com and Sustainable Industries Merge]" Triple Pundit, Oct. 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 2013 Sustainable Industries stopped publishing under its masthead.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://twitter.com/sustainablemag/status/414167450356170753 Farewell Transmission]" Twitter, Dec. 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''zoological specimen''' is an animal or part of an animal preserved for scientific use.
Various uses are: to verify the identity of a ([[species]]), to allow study, increase public knowledge of [[zoology]].
Zoological specimens are extremely diverse. Examples are bird and mammal study skins, [[Taxidermy|mounted specimens]], skeletal material, casts, pinned insects, dried material, animals preserved in liquid preservatives, and microscope slides.
[[List of natural history museums|Natural history museums]] are repositories of zoological specimens

==Study skins==
{{main|Taxidermy}}
[[File:Berlin Naturkundemuseum tote Voegel.jpg|thumb|230px| Study skins of  ''[[Garrulus glandarius]]'' in [[Museum für Naturkunde]], Berlin]]Bird and mammal specimens are conserved as dry [[Taxidermy#Study_skins|study skins]], a form of taxidermy.&lt;ref name="Queensland Museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/Find+out+about/Behind+the+Scenes/Taxidermy#.Wy0dERSnT8s
|title=Taxidermy|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=|website=Queensland Museum Network|publisher=The State Queensland|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skin is removed from the animal's carcass, treated with absorbents, and filled with cotton or polyester batting (In the past plant fibres or sawdust were used). Bird specimens have a long, thin, wooden dowel wrapped in batting at their center. The dowel is often intentionally longer than the bird's body and exits at the animal's vent. This exposed dowel provides a place to handle the bird without disturbing the feathers. Mammal study skins do not normally utilize wooden dowels, instead preparators use wire to support the legs and tail of mammals. Labels are attached to a leg of the specimen with thread or string. Heat and chemicals are sometimes used to aid the drying of study skins.

==Skeletal Preparations (Osteology)==
[[File:Hog-nosed Skunk Skeleton.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Hog-nosed skunk]] skeleton]]
[[Osteology|Osteological]] collections consist of cleaned, complete and partial skeletons, [[Skull|crania]] of [[Vertebrates]], mainly birds and mammals. They are used in studies of  [[Comparative anatomy|comparative]] anatomy and to identify bones from archaeological sites. Human bones are used in medical and forensic studies.

==Molluscs==
[[File:Museum fg02.jpg|thumb|Dry specimens of Mollusca in [[Museum Wiesbaden]]]]
In museum collections it is common for the dry material to greatly exceed the amount of material that is preserved in alcohol. The shells minus their soft parts are kept in card trays within drawers or in glass tubes, often as lots (a lot is a collection of a single species taken from a single locality on a single occasion). Shell collections sometimes suffer from [[Byne's disease]] which also affects birds eggs. The study of dry mollusc shells is called [[conchology]] as distinct from [[malacology]] (wet specimens).

==Insects and similar invertebrates==
:''Main articles: [[Insect collecting]]''
[[File:Sceliphron and pest.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A pinned wasp. The dried insect is under attack from pests and this drawer will have to be frozen to contain the problem.]]

Most hard-bodied insect specimens and some other hard-bodied invertebrates such as certain [[Arachnid]]a, are preserved as pinned specimens. Either while still fresh, or after rehydrating them if necessary because they had dried out, specimens are transfixed by special stainless steel [[Entomological equipment for mounting and storage|entomological pins]]. As the insect dries the internal tissues solidify and, possibly aided to some extent by the integument, they grip the pin and secure the specimen in place on the pin. Very small, delicate specimens may instead be secured by fine steel points driven into slips of card, or glued to card points or similar attachments that in turn are pinned in the same way as entire mounted insects. The pins offer a means of handling the specimens without damage, and they also bear labels for descriptive and reference data.

Once dried, the specimens may be kept in conveniently sized open trays. The bottoms of the trays are lined with a material suited to receiving and holding entomological pins securely and conveniently. Cork and foam plastics are convenient examples. However, open trays are very vulnerable to attack by [[Anthrenus museorum|museum beetle]] and similar pests, so such open trays are stored in turn inside glass-topped, insect-proof drawers, commonly protected by suitable [[pesticide]]s or [[insect repellent|repellent]]s or barriers. Alternatively, some museums store the pinned specimens directly in larger trays or drawers that are glass-topped and stored in cabinets.

In contrast to such dried specimens, soft-bodied specimens most commonly are kept in "wet collections", meaning that they are stored in alcohol or similar preservative or [[Fixation (histology)|fixative]] liquids, according to the intended function.

Small specimens, whether hard or soft bodied, and whether entire, [[Dissection|dissected]], or [[Histology#Sectioning|sectioned]], may be stored as [[microscope slide]] preparations.

==Wet specimens==
[[File:Collection1-nat-museum-berlin hg.jpg|thumb|Collection of spiders preserved in alcohol (spirit collection)]]
"Wet" specimen collections are stored in different solutions. A very old method is to store the specimen in 70% [[ethanol]] with various additives after fixing with [[formalin]]&lt;ref&gt;BLUM, J.: Formol als Conservierungsflüssigkeit. Zool. Anz. 16, 1893, Page 450-452&lt;/ref&gt; or in these days sometimes with a salt-solution.&lt;ref&gt;COLEMAN, R. / KOGAN, I.: An improved low-formaldehyde embalming fluid to preserve cadavers for anatomy teaching. J. Anat. 192, 1998, Page 443-446&lt;/ref&gt; Some methods are very useful, because the color can be preserved. (Salt-)Solutions like this are Jores,&lt;ref&gt;JORES, L.: ''Die Conservierung anatomischer Präparate in Blutfarbe mittels Formalin.'' Zbl. Path. Jena 7, 1896, Page 134&lt;/ref&gt; Kaiserling&lt;ref&gt;KAISERLING, C.: ''Über die Conservierung von Sammlungspräparaten mit der Erhaltung der natürlichen Farben.'' Klin. Wschr. 33, 1896, Page 725&lt;/ref&gt; and Romhányi.&lt;ref&gt;
ROMÁNHYI, G.: ''Einfaches Verfahren zur Konservierung in natürlichen Farben.'' Virchows Arch. 328, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Modern specimens are stored in [[borosilicate glass]] due to its chemical and thermal resistance and good optical clarity.

==Data==
[[File:SalimAliLabel.jpg|thumb|Label accompanying a bird skin.Note that the locality, date, identity of the specimen and collection catalogue numbers are given on the securely attached label]]
Minimum data associated with zoological specimens is the place and date of collection, attached to the specimen by a label. Additional information is the name of the collector and the habitat. Tissue from specimens may be saved for genetic studies (molecular data, [[DNA]]). Depending on the [[Taxon|animal group]], other data may be included, for instance in bird collections the bird’s breeding condition, weight, colours of its eyes, bills and legs and nature of the stomach contents.

==Composite specimens==
A single specimen may be a composite of preparations sharing a unique number. An example would be a vertebrate with an alcohol-preserved skin and viscera, a cleared and [[Staining|stained]] head, the post-cranial dried skeleton, [[Histology|histological]], glass slides of various organs, and frozen tissue samples. This specimen could also be a voucher for a publication, or photographs and audiotape.

==Voucher specimens==
A voucher is a representative specimen of the animal used in a study, such as a specimen collected as part of an [[Ecology|ecological]] survey or a specimen which was the source of DNA for a molecular study. Voucher specimens confirm the identity of the species referred to in the study. They are a backup against misidentification, changing [[Species problem|species concepts]] which mislead results. [[Holotype|Type]] specimens are a special type of voucher specimen used in [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].
[[File:Wied fg01.jpg| thumb|180px|Mounted specimen of the [[Black-throated toucanet]] collected by [[Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied]] and now in [[Naturhistorisches Museum|Naturhistorisches Museum Wien]]]]

==Historic specimens==
Museum zoological specimens may have [[Timeline of zoology|historic significance]]. For example, the specimens collected by [[Johann Baptist von Spix]] and [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius]] during their Brazil Expedition (1817–1820) are housed in the [[Zoologische Staatssammlung München|Munich Zoology Museum]].

==Models==
Museums make extensive use of models. When these are accurate they are considered to be specimens in their own right. Examples are the glass [[coelenterate]]s of  [[Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]].
