{{History of Kosovo}}
The worst ethnic violence in [[Kosovo]] since the end of the 1999 conflict erupted in the partitioned town of [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovica]], leaving hundreds wounded and at least 14 people dead. [[UN]] peacekeepers and [[Nato]] troops scrambled to contain a raging gun battle between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fourteen dead as ethnic violence sweeps Kosovo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/18/balkans|website=theguardian.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Serbia the events were also called the March Pogrom.

International courts in Pristina have prosecuted several people who attacked several Serbian Orthodox churches, handing down jail sentences ranging from 21 months to 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bitter Memories of Kosovo’s Deadly March Riots|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/bitter-memories-of-kosovo-s-deadly-march-riots|website=balkaninsight.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|2}}

==Background==
The [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) was an ethnic-Albanian [[paramilitary]] organisation which had as its founding goal unification of Albanian inhabited lands in the Balkans, stressing [[Albanian culture]], ethnicity and nation.&lt;ref name="Yoshihara71"&gt;{{harvnb|Yoshihara|2006|p=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perritt29"&gt;{{harvnb|Perritt|2008|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KoktsidisDam165166"&gt;{{harvnb|Koktsidis|Dam|2008|pp=165–166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict escalated from 1997 onward due to the Yugoslavian army retaliating with a crackdown in the region resulting in violence and population displacements.&lt;ref name="Yoshihara71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldman308373"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|1997|pp=308, 373}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan178"&gt;{{harvnb|Allan|Zelizer|2004|p=178}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The bloodshed, ethnic cleansing of thousands of Albanians driving them into neighbouring countries and the potential of it to destabilize the region provoked intervention by international organizations and agencies, such as the United Nations, NATO and [[International non-governmental organization|INGO]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=Robert S.|title=International organizations: A comparative approach to the management of cooperation|p=129|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275965495}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yoshihara|first=Susan Fink|chapter=Kosovo|pp=67–68|editor1-last=Reveron|editor1-first=Derek S.|editor2-last=Murer|editor2-first=Jeffrey Stevenson|title=Flashpoints in the War on Terrorism|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135449315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people from non-Albanian communities such as the Serbs and Romani fled Kosovo fearing revenge attacks by armed people and returning refugees while others were pressured by the KLA and armed gangs to leave.&lt;ref name="Herring232234"&gt;{{harvnb|Herring|2000|pp=232–234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Post conflict Kosovo was placed under an international United Nations framework with the ''[[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]]'' (UNMIK) overseeing administrative affairs and the ''[[Kosovo Force|UN Kosovo Force]]'' (KFOR) dealing with defence.&lt;ref name="Herring232"&gt;{{harvnb|Herring|2000|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Within post-conflict Kosovo Albanian society, calls for retaliation for previous violence done by Serb forces during the war circulated through public culture.&lt;ref name="Herscher14"&gt;{{harvnb|Herscher|2010|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, prolonged negotiations over Kosovo's future status, sociopolitical problems and nationalist sentiments resulted in the Kosovo unrest.&lt;ref name="RauschBanar246"&gt;{{harvnb|Rausch|Banar|2006|p=246}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Egleder79"&gt;{{harvnb|Egleder|2013|p=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
===Shooting of Serbian teen===
On 15 March 2004 an 18-year-old Serb, Jovica Ivić, was murdered in a drive-by shooting in the village of [[Čaglavica]] in the central region of Kosovo.&lt;ref name="15march-B92"&gt;{{cite news|title=U Čaglavici pucano na srpskog mladića iz automobila u pokretu|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2004&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=15&amp;nav_category=12&amp;nav_id=135320|accessdate=21 December 2014|agency=Beta|publisher=B92|date=15 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===16 March pro-KLA protests===
On 16 March, three KLA war veterans associations organized widespread demonstrations in ethnic Albanian cities and towns, protesting the arrests of former KLA leaders on war crime charges, including the February arrests of four commanders.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=17}} The pro-KLA, anti-UNMIK protests, with 18,000 protesters, lay the basis for the following demonstrations sparked by the sensational reports of drowning of three Albanian children.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=18}}

===Drowning of Albanian children===
On 16 March, three Albanian children drowned in the Ibar River in the village of Čabar, near the Serb community of [[Zubin Potok]]. A fourth boy survived. It was speculated that he and his friends had been chased into the river by Serbs in revenge for the shooting of Ivić the previous day, but this claim has not been proven.&lt;ref name="bbc-no-evidence"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3667839.stm | publisher = BBC | title = No evidence over Kosovo drownings  | date=2004-04-28 | accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN police spokesman Neeraj Singh said the surviving boy had been under intense pressure from ethnic Albanian journalists who had suggested what he should say. His version of events differed from that of two other children who had also been in the river, Singh told a news conference in Pristina. The spokesperson said there were "very significant" inconsistencies in the accounts given by the child during two separate interviews, and a lack of corroboration of his story. "In fact, it is logically at odds in several respects with other evidence," Mr. Singh said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/node/146375|title=Lack of evidence stalls probe into drowning of 3 Kosovo children, UN Mission says|work=ReliefWeb|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="setimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/bs/features/setimes/features/2004/04/040429-SVETLA-001|title=UN Investigation Clears Serbs of Kosovo Drownings|date=29 April 2004|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN found no evidence that Serbs were responsible for drowning the three Albanian children.&lt;ref name="setimes.com"/&gt;

==Violence==
{{moresources|section|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Facade of Serb House Destroyed in 2004 Pogrom - Prizren - Kosovo - 02.jpg|thumb|250px|Ruins of a Kosovo Serb house in [[Prizren]] that was destroyed by rioters.]]

On 17 and 18 March 2004, a wave of violent riots swept through Kosovo, triggered by two incidents perceived as ethnically-motivated acts. Demonstrations, although seemingly spontaneous at the outset, quickly focused on Serbs throughout Kosovo.
27 people were killed (11 Kosovo Albanians, 16 Kosovo Serbs), more than 900 persons were injured (including 65 international police officers and 58 Kosovo Police Service officers), and more than 800 buildings destroyed or damaged (including 29 churches or monasteries). 

By one estimate, more than 50,000 people participated in the riots. The Legal System Monitoring Section of the OSCE Mission in Kosovo (“the OSCE”) has closely monitored the investigations and trials from March 2004 until present. With its monitoring of 73 cases (Municipal, District and Minor Offences Courts) pending between December 2005 and March 2008, the OSCE now follows up on a first report of December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organization for Security an d Co-operation in Europe MISSION IN KOSOVO Monitoring Department, Legal System Monitoring Section|url=https://www.osce.org/kosovo/32700?download=true|website=osce.org|publisher=OSCE|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of Albanians gathered at the south end of the bridge across the Ibar at [[Kosovska Mitrovica]], which divides the Serb and Albanian districts of the town. A large crowd of Serbs gathered at the north end to prevent the Albanians from crossing. Peacekeepers from the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) blockaded the bridge, using tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades to keep the crowds apart. However, gunmen on both sides opened fire with sub-machine guns and grenades, killing at least eight people (two Albanians and six Serbs) and wounding over 300. Eleven peacekeepers were also injured, of which two seriously.

The violence quickly spread to other parts of Kosovo, with Kosovo Serb communities and Serbian cultural heritage (churches and monasteries) attacked by crowds of Albanians. Serb returnees were attacked.{{sfn|B92 Specijal|2004}} Some of the locations were ostensibly under the protection of KFOR at the time. During the riots and violence, eight Serbs were killed. Among damaged property were at least 35 churches, including 18 [[Cultural Heritage of Serbia|monuments of culture]], demolished, burnt or severely damaged.&lt;ref name="B92-1"/&gt; The casualty toll at the end of the day was 28 and 600 people were injured, including 61 peacekeepers and 55 police officers.

===Čaglavica===
In [[Čaglavica]], 12,000 Kosovo Albanian rioters tried to storm the Serb-populated areas. Norwegian [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] peacekeepers created a blockade by using tear gas, rubber bullets, and stun grenades, in order to keep the two groups apart. A truck was driven by a Kosovo Albanian at full speed towards the barricade in an attempt to penetrate the line. After firing warning shots at the truck, the Norwegians had to use deadly force to avoid friendly casualties, and shot the driver. 16 Norwegian peacekeepers were injured, and 13 had to be evacuated.&lt;ref name="forsvaret-video"&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Kjell-Olav Myhre|year=2014|title=Kosovo 2004: 12000 kosovoalbanerne angriper den kosovoserbiske landsbyen Caglavica|trans-title=Kosovo 2004: 12,000 Kosovo Albanians assault the Kosovo Serb village of Caglavica|language=Norwegian|url=http://forsvaret.no/sites/video/PublishingImages/veterandagen-2014-kjellolav/veteran-2014-kjellolavmyhre.mp4|accessdate=9 May 2014|publisher=Forsvaret (Norwegian Armed Forces)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714072330/http://forsvaret.no/sites/video/PublishingImages/veterandagen-2014-kjellolav/veteran-2014-kjellolavmyhre.mp4|archivedate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another KFOR unit consisting of mostly Swedish soldiers also participated in defending Čaglavica that day, supported by people from the barracks who normally worked with non-military tasks. Lieutenant Colonel Hans Håkansson, who commanded 700 people during the unrest, reported that the fighting went on for 11 hours, and that many collapsed due to dehydration and injuries while struggling to fend off waves of rioters.&lt;ref name=Zaremba&gt;{{cite news|last=Zaremba|first=Maciej|title=Mandom, mod och landstingstossor|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/kulturdebatt/mandom-mod-och-landstingstossor|accessdate=9 May 2014|newspaper=Dagens Nyheter|date=15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 35 people were injured while defending the town.&lt;ref name=Zaremba/&gt; Hans Håkansson was awarded with a medal for his actions by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gotländsk militär får belöningsmedalj|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=94&amp;artikel=729267|accessdate=11 January 2015|agency=Sveriges Radio|publisher=P4 Gotland|date=8 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Priština===
Following the attacks in [[Čaglavica]], the mob of Albanians turned their attention on the few remaining Serbs living in [[Priština]] in the YU Program apartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2004/07/25/failure-protect/anti-minority-violence-kosovo-march-2004 |title=Failure to Protect,Anti-Minority Violence in Kosovo, March 2004|publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apartments came under attack after the mob of Albanians blocked all of the entrances and set fire to the ground floors. Serbs who tried to flee the apartments were shot at by firearms or stabbed by members of the crowd. The mob began to loot apartments and were chanting pro [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] chants and calling for the killing of Serbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2004/07/25/failure-protect/anti-minority-violence-kosovo-march-2004 |title=Failure to Protect,Anti-Minority Violence in Kosovo, March 2004|publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] and [[UNMIK]] police over 6 hours to evacuate the Serbs who were under constant fire from armed Albanians. Following the evacuation the crowd began to converge on the [[Church of Christ the Saviour, Pristina| Church of the Christ Savour]] burning and damaging the facade and inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2004/07/25/failure-protect/anti-minority-violence-kosovo-march-2004 |title=Failure to Protect,Anti-Minority Violence in Kosovo, March 2004|publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peć===
Albanians rioted in the city of [[Peć]], attacking [[UN]] offices. One Albanian was killed by UN police.{{sfn|B92 Specijal|2004}} Serb returnees were attacked at [[:sh:Belo Polje (Pe%C4%87)|Belo Polje]].{{sfn|B92 Specijal|2004}}

===Lipljan===
Albanians and KFOR were engaged in gunfights in the town of [[Lipljan]]. Four Serbs were murdered, while Serbs taking refuge in the local Orthodox church were attacked.{{sfn|B92 Specijal|2004}}

===Vučitrn===
All Serb houses in the Serb-inhabited village of [[Svinjare]] in Vučitrn, near Kosovska Mitrovica, were burnt down.&lt;ref name=Zaremba/&gt;

===Prizren===
On 17 March, ethnic Albanians started attacking the Serb settlement in Prizren, including the Seminary, and reportedly there was no UNMIK, [[Kosovo Police]] and KFOR present there at the time.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=54}} The mob set the Seminary on fire, with people inside, and beat several elder people, with one man dying in the burning.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|pp=54-55}} 

The German KFOR's refusal to mobilize to protect the local Serbs are one of the main security failures of the 2004 unrest.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=55}} UNMIK in Prizren said that the terror, 56 Serb houses and 5 historical churches that were burnt down, could have been prevented by the KFOR.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=55}}

==Destroyed churches==

==Reactions in Kosovo==
Kosovo Albanian politicians such as President [[Ibrahim Rugova]] and Prime Minister [[Bajram Rexhepi]] joined UN governor Harri Holkeri, NATO southern commander Gregory Johnson, and other KFOR officials in condemning the violence and appealing for peace in Kosovo.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=59}}

Kosovo Police established a special investigation team to handle cases related to the 2004 unrest and according to Kosovo Judicial Council by the end of 2006 the 326 charges filed by municipal and district prosecutors for criminal offenses in connection with the unrest had resulted in 200 indictments: convictions in 134 cases, and courts acquitted eight and dismissed 28; 30 cases were pending.

==Reactions in Serbia==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
The events in Kosovo brought an immediate angry reaction on the streets of Serbia. On the evening of 17 March, crowds gathered in [[Belgrade]], [[Novi Sad]] and [[Niš]] to demonstrate against the treatment of the Kosovo Serbs. Despite appeals for calm by [[Amfilohije Radović|Metropolitan Amfilohije]], the 17th-century [[Bajrakli Mosque, Belgrade|Bajrakli Mosque]] was set on fire. Islam Aga mosque in the southern city of Niš was also set on fire, while demonstrators chanted "Kill, kill Albanians!" When police arrived the mosque was already burning and some media reported that the police didn't move the crowd, so they blocked the fire fighters access to the mosque, leaving them unable to extinguish the fire.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2005/serbia1005/4.htm#_Toc115505925 Dangerous Indifference: Violence against Minorities in Serbia: March 2004 Violence Against Albanians and Muslims&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Both buildings were extensively damaged but were saved from complete destruction by the intervention of police and firefighters.&lt;ref name="f18"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=280 | publisher = [[F18 News]] | work = KOSOVO &amp; SERBIA | title = Churches &amp; mosques destroyed amid inter-ethnic violence | accessdate= 23 May 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also properties of Muslim minorities, such as Goranis, Turks or Albanians were vandalized in Novi Sad and other cities throughout Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2005/serbia1005/4.htm|title=Dangerous Indifference: Violence against Minorities in Serbia: March 2004 Violence Against Albanians and Muslims|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch has concluded that the Serbian state failed to prosecute violence in Novi Sad.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt;

The Serbian government publicly denounced the violence in Kosovo. Prime Minister [[Vojislav Koštunica]] strongly criticized the failure of NATO and the UN to prevent the violence, and called for a state of emergency to be imposed on Kosovo. He gave a speech blaming organized Albanian separatists: "The events in northern Kosovo-Metohija reveal the true nature of Albanian separatism, its violent and terrorist nature ...  [The government will] do all it can to stop the terror in Kosovo".&lt;ref name="bbc-media"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3523916.stm | publisher = BBC | title = Media fan Kosovo flames  | date=2004-03-18 | accessdate=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister of Minority Rights of [[Serbia and Montenegro]], Rasim Ljajić, himself a Muslim, said "What is now happening in Kosovo confirms two things: that this is a collapse of the international mission, and a total defeat of the international community." Nebojsa Čović, the Serbian government's chief negotiator on matters relating to Kosovo, was sent to Kosovska Mitrovica on March 18 in a bid to calm the situation there. Serbian security forces also guarded the border between Serbia and Kosovo in a bid to prevent demonstrators and paramilitaries from entering the province to foment further unrest. The events were compared by Prime Minister Koštunica to [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3551571.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kosovo clashes 'ethnic cleansing' | date=20 March 2004 | accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serbs, represented by the "Union of Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija", described the ordeal as "genocide" in a letter sent to the Serbian and Russian patriarchs, to Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and the Serbian government, where, besides that, they quote the burning of seven villages during the World War II-German occupation to the "several hundreds" burnt "under the rule of the troops of Christian Europe and America" and according to which the "occupation of Kosovo surpasses all we had to sustain under fascism." The spared Serb villages are compared to "concentration camps" because of the missing [[freedom of movement]], electricity and heating. According to the letter, after 1999 there were 8,500 homicides or disappearances of non-Albanian people with no single accomplice tried.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravoslavie.ru/news/060415154741 Full text of the letter] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120910124959/http://www.pravoslavie.ru/news/060415154741 |date=2012-09-10 }} in Russian, in the name of 120 000 Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, seven years after the incident, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić spoke at the Wheaton College in Chicago:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In less than 72 hours, 35 churches and monasteries were set on fire, many of which date back to the 14th century or even further away in history, which represents an irretrievable loss for the mankind. Dozens of people were killed. Several thousand were wounded. Thousands of houses and shops were leveled to the ground. More than 4,000 Kosovo Serbs were expelled from their homes.&lt;ref name="B92-1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Serbia the events were also called the March Pogrom.&lt;ref name="WashingtonTimes"&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/apr/9/20050409-102733-9741r/ Anti-Serb programs in Kosovo], By The Washington Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B92-1"&gt;B92.net, ''[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=18&amp;nav_id=73300 FM talks Kosovo at U.S. college]'', 18 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/ci/story/1/%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0/570011/%D0%A8%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82+%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%BE%D0%B4+%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3+%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0+.html Шест година од мартовског погрома] RTS.rs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/teme/teme.97.html:tema-167-Martovski-pogrom Martovski pogrom] Večernje novosti&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravoslavie.ru/news/51111.htm|title=ЕПИСКОП ФЕОДОСИЙ ПРОТИВ ПЕРЕДАЧИ МОНАСТЫРЯ ПОД ОХРАНУ КОСОВСКОЙ ПОЛИЦЕЙСКОЙ СЛУЖБЫ|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reaction==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2018}}

The international community was taken by surprise by the sudden upsurge in violence. Kosovo had been fairly quiet since the end of 1999, although there had been occasional small-scale ethnic clashes throughout the past five years and an ongoing tension between Serbs and Albanians. This had, however, largely gone unnoticed by the Western media since 1999.

KFOR troops closed Kosovo's borders with the remainder of Serbia and Montenegro and the UN suspended flights in and out of the province. NATO announced on 18 March that it would send another 1,000 troops – 750 of them from the [[United Kingdom]] – to reinforce the 18,500 troops already there.&lt;ref name="nato"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nato.int/shape/news/2004/03/i040318a.htm |title=NATO deploys "prudent reinforcements" to Kosovo in response to violence |publisher=[[NATO]] |accessdate=23 May 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529195314/http://www.nato.int/shape/news/2004/03/i040318a.htm |archivedate=29 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN and [[European Union]] both appealed for calm, calling on local leaders to restrain their supporters. [[UN Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] urged both sides to cooperate with the peacekeeping forces but pointedly reminded the Kosovo Albanians that they had a responsibility "to protect and promote the rights of all people within Kosovo, particularly its minorities".

An Austrian [[OSCE]] official called the events an orchestrated plan to drive out the remaining Serbs, while one anonymous UNMIK official reportedly referred to the event as ''Kosovo's [[Kristallnacht]]''. The commander of NATO's South Flank, Admiral [[Gregory G. Johnson]], said on 19 March that the violence verged on ethnic cleansing of Serbs by Albanians. On 20 March, Kosovo's UN administrator, [[Harri Holkeri]], told journalists that "Maybe the very beginning was spontaneous but after the beginning certain extremist groups had an opportunity to orchestrate the situation and that is why we urgently are working to get those perpetrators into justice."&lt;ref name="bbc-blame"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3553837.stm | publisher = BBC | title = Kosovo clashes 'orchestrated'  | date=2004-03-20 | accessdate=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], at least 19 people died—11 Albanians and eight Serbs—and over 1,000 were injured while some 730 houses belonging to minorities, mostly Kosovo Serbs, as well as 36 Orthodox churches, monasteries and other religious and cultural sites were damaged or destroyed. In less than 48 hours, 4,100 minority community members were newly displaced (more than the total of 3,664 that had returned throughout 2003), of whom 82% were Serbs and the remaining 18% included Romani (and Ashkali) as well as an estimated 350 Albanians from the Serb-majority areas of [[Kosovska Mitrovica]] and [[Leposavić]].

*{{flagicon|France}} [[France]] pledged to send about 400 more troops immediately to the region after the violence began.&lt;ref name="kosovo clashes" /&gt;

*{{flagicon|Serbia}} Serbian Prime Minister [[Vojislav Koštunica]] described the attacks as "planned in advance and co-ordinated... this was an attempted pogrom and ethnic cleansing" against Kosovo's Serbs.&lt;ref name="kosovo clashes" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3718">In [[topology]], an '''Akbulut cork''' is a structure that is frequently used to show that in four dimensions, the smooth [[h-cobordism]] theorem fails. It was named after [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[mathematician]] [[Selman Akbulut]].&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Gompf and A.I. Stipsicz, 4-manifolds and Kirby calculus (p.357), AMS Pub. GSM v.20 {{isbn|0-8218-0994-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.Scorpan, The wild world of 4-manifolds (p.90), AMS Pub. {{isbn|0-8218-3749-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A compact contractible Stein 4-manifold C with involution F on its boundary is called an Akbulut cork, if F extends to a self-homeomorphism but cannot extend to a self-diffeomorphism inside (hence a cork is an exotic copy of itself relative to its boundary). A cork (C,F) is called a cork of a smooth 4-manifold X, if removing C from X and re-gluing it via F changes the smooth structure of X (this operation is called "cork twisting"). Any exotic copy X' of a closed simply connected 4-manifold X differs from X by a single cork twist.&lt;ref&gt;S. Akbulut, A Fake compact contractible 4-manifold, Journ. of Diff. Geom. 33, (1991), 335-356&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Matveyev, A decomposition of smooth simply-connected h-cobordant 4-manifolds, J. Differential Geom. 44 (1996), no. 3, 571–582&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Curtis, M. H. Freedman, W. C. Hsiang, and R. Stong, A decomposition theorem for h-cobordant smooth simply-connected compact 4-manifolds, Invent. Math. 123 (1996), no. 2, 343–348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Akbulut and R. Matveyev, A convex decomposition theorem for 4-manifolds, Internat. Math. Res. Notices 1998, no. 7, 371–381&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Akbulut and K. Yasui, Corks, Plugs and exotic structures, Jour. of GGT, vol 2 (2008) 40-82&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic idea of the Akbulut cork is that when attempting to use the h-corbodism theorem in four dimensions, the cork is the sub-cobordism that contains all the exotic properties of the spaces connected with the cobordism, and when removed the two spaces become trivially h-cobordant and smooth. This shows that in four dimensions, although the theorem does not tell us that two [[manifold]]s are [[diffeomorphic]] (only [[homeomorphic]]), they are "not far" from being diffeomorphic.&lt;ref name=AMB&gt;Asselmeyer-Maluga and Brans, 2007, ''Exotic Smoothness and Physics''&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate this (without proof), consider a smooth h-cobordism ''W''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; between two 4-manifolds ''M'' and ''N''. Then within ''W'' there is a sub-cobordism ''K''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; between ''A''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''M'' and ''B''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''N'' and there is a diffeomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;W \setminus \operatorname{int}\, K \cong \left(M \setminus \operatorname{int}\, A \right) \times \left[0,1\right],&lt;/math&gt;

which is the content of the h-cobordism theorem for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;5 (here int&amp;nbsp;''X'' refers to the interior of a manifold ''X''). In addition, ''A'' and ''B'' are diffeomorphic with a diffeomorphism that is an [[involute|involution]] on the boundary ∂''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∂''B''.&lt;ref name=Scorpan&gt;Scorpan, A., 2005 ''The Wild World of 4-Manifolds''&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it can be seen that the h-corbordism ''K'' connects ''A'' with its "inverted" image ''B''. This submanifold ''A'' is the Akbulut cork.

'''Alkarama''' ({{lang-ar|الكرامة لحقوق الإنسان}} / [[ISO 233]]: {{transl|ar|ISO|al-karāmah li-ḥuqūq al-’insān}} / Dignity) is an independent [[Swiss]]-based [[human rights]] [[non-governmental organization]] established in 2004 to assist all those in the [[Arab World]] subjected to, or at risk for, [[extrajudicial killings]], [[Forced disappearance|disappearances]], [[torture]], and [[arbitrary detention]]. 
Acting as a bridge between individual victims in the [[Arab World]] and international [[human rights]] mechanisms, Alkarama works towards an [[Arab World]] where all individuals live free, with [[dignity]], and protected by the [[rule of law]].

==Organization==

===Mission===
Alkarama is an [[NGO]] defending the victims of human rights violations in the Arab world – including violations of the [[right to life]], to physical and mental integrity, and to Civil and Political Rights – by using in priority [[international law]] mechanisms. Alkarama also helps to promote a culture of [[human rights]] in the [[Arab world]].

Although it recognises the indivisibility of [[human rights]], Alkarama has given priority to the defence of people subjected or at risk of [[extrajudicial killing]], [[enforced disappearance]], [[torture]], and [[arbitrary detention]], as Alkarama regards these violations of the right to life, physical integrity, and civil and political rights as common in this region.

To end these violations, Alkarama cooperates with local and national [[civil society]] activists and [[international organisations]] for the promotion and protection of [[human rights]], as well as governments and other entities likely to act on the [[human rights]] situation.

By engaging international mechanisms, Alkarama offers support and a last resort to the victims of these human rights violations, so that they achieve respect for their rights against the failure or inefficiency of their country's [[justice system]].

Alkarama also works for a strong international system of [[human rights]] protection, which reinforces the regional, national, and local protection systems. In, particular, it contributes to fill the information gaps, and to increase the attention of international [[human rights]] protection mechanisms on [[human rights]] violations taking place in the [[Arab World]]. Alkarama encourages [[State (polity)|States]] to strengthen their national laws to defend and promote human [[rights]].

Finally, Alkarama contributes to the promotion of the culture of [[human rights]], by ensuring that the various groups that make up the [[civil society]] in these countries are familiar with the concept of [[human rights]] and are mobilising around it, know their rights and claim them, and feel protected by law.

Through its projects, Alkarama provides these actors the necessary tools so that they can assert their rights both nationally and internationally.

===Goals===
1. Document and denounce [[human rights]] violations in the [[Arab world]]

2. Provide moral and judicial assistance to the victims of [[human rights]] violations

3. Pursue the perpetrators of [[human rights]] violations and fight [[impunity]]

4. Encourage, and campaign for governments to respect [[human rights]]

5. Spread the culture of [[human rights]] in Arab societies

6. Train [[human rights defenders]]

7. Support any initiative which reinforces the protection of [[citizens]] against [[human rights violations]]

8. Be an effective organization

==Focus==

Alkarama focuses on the most serious [[human rights]] violations, i.e. violations that relate to the [[right to life]], human [[dignity]], [[bodily integrity]] and [[freedom]]. The idea behind Alkarama's specific mandate is that only when citizens are free from the most serious [[human rights]] abuses that individuals can freely and effectively call for all of their rights and ensure the [[rule of law]] in their countries.

===(i) Extrajudicial Killings===

According to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every human being has the inherent [[right to life]]. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions intervenes on cases of executions outside the legal framework or without the proper legal safeguards: capital punishment following an unfair trial, deaths in custody, deaths due to excessive use of force by law enforcement officials, deaths due to attacks by States security forces, violations of the [[right to life]] in armed conflict, genocide, and the imminent expulsion of persons to a country where their lives are in danger.

===(ii) Enforced Disappearance===

According to the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance]] (CED):

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Enforced disappearance]] is considered to be the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of [[liberty]] by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorisation, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of [[liberty]] or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the [[disappeared]] person, which place such a person outside the protection of the [[law]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''A tool of repression'''

Many of the governments of the [[Arab World]] use [[Forced disappearance|disappearances]] to silence opposition members and terrorize the population.

[[Algeria]] is a notable example of this practice. Alkarama has presented over 1,000 cases of [[Forced disappearance|disappearances]] to the [[United Nations]] Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID). The number of [[disappeared]] in [[Algeria]] is estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 – the Algerian government admitted to 6,164 in 2005; the Algerian [[national human rights institution]], the Commission Nationale Consultative de Promotion et de Protection des Droits de l'Homme (CNCPPDH) to 8,023.

===(iii) Torture===

According to the [[Convention against Torture]] (CAT):

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Torture]] means any act by which severe [[pain]] or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a [[confession]], punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on [[discrimination]] of any kind, when such [[pain]] or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an [[official]] capacity. It does not include [[pain]] or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon receipt of information about cases of [[torture]] from its representatives and [[civil society]] contacts in the [[Arab world]], Alkarama writes a communication to the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on [[Torture]] (SRT) with details of the case.

===(iv) Arbitrary Detention===

According to the [[UN]] Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD):

Deprivation of [[liberty]] is arbitrary if the case falls into one of the following three categories:

1. When it is clearly impossible to invoke any legal basis justifying the deprivation of [[liberty]] [...] (Category I)

2. When the deprivation of [[liberty]] results from the exercise of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and, insofar as States parties are concerned, by the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (Category II)

3. When the total or partial non-observance of the international norms relating to the right to a fair trial spelled out in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and in the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned, is of such gravity as to give the deprivation of [[liberty]] an [[arbitrary]] character (Category III). (WGAD, Fact Sheet No. 26)

'''Arbitrary Detention in the [[Arab World]]: the [[United Nation]]'s Opinion'''

Arab governments often arrest and detain political opponents and [[human rights defenders]] in order to quiet their criticism of government policies and behaviour. The opinions issued by the WGAD can then be used in local and international [[advocacy]] against these detentions, be brought up with the governments and authorities directly, and can lead to enough pressure to have these individuals released in some cases. Many governments are very sensitive to their international image and [[human rights]] record.

== History ==

=== 2004: Creation of Alkarama ===

Alkarama was created as a Swiss association in July 2004 by Qatari and Algerian [[human rights defenders]] – [[Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi|Abdulrahman Al Naimi]], [[Rachid Mesli]] and [[Abbas Aroua]] – to contribute to an [[Arab World]] where all individuals live free, in [[dignity]], and protected by the [[rule of law]]. With this goal in mind, the founders decided to address the most serious violations of human dignity, physical integrity and freedom, namely [[extrajudicial killings]], [[enforced disappearances]], [[torture]], and [[arbitrary detention]], with the hope that individuals who no longer fear being subjected to these violations can speak and act freely to call for their rights and ensure the rule of law in their countries.

At the time of Alkarama's creation, the [[United Nations]] (UN) mechanisms established to protect human rights worldwide rarely acted upon violations in the [[Arab region]]. Identifying this gap, Alkarama decided that in order to bring these violations to an end, Alkarama would act through the UN’s mechanisms specific to bring these [[human rights]] violations to an end. In doing so, Alkarama would also fulfill its objective to contribute to a better understanding of [[human rights]] and raise awareness of the UN's human rights protection mechanisms in the Arab [[civil society]], including amongst social groups who often viewed these instruments as ineffective or understood rights as Western concepts, in particular Islamist groups, political opposition parties, and journalists.

By acting as a bridge between the victims in the Arab world and the UN Special Procedures experts, whilst building the capacity of local activists to directly access [[UN]] mechanisms and use the decisions they adopt to call for the respect of [[human rights]] in their countries, Alkarama gave itself the means to achieve its two main objectives simultaneously. This involves speaking directly and regularly with victims and their families, lawyers, or local activists to document individual cases of [[human rights]] violations; and submitting these cases to the [[UN]] mechanisms for them to request the relevant government authorities to remedy to the situation.

Between 2004 and 2007, [[Rachid Mesli]], at the time Alkarama's sole employee in [[Geneva]], submitted around 400 individual cases to the UN Special Procedures, leading to these mechanisms' action with a number of [[Arab States]], and a noticeable improvement of the situation for many of the victims. Following up on its successes and growing needs, in 2005 Alkarama recruited Country Representatives in [[Lebanon]] and [[Yemen]] in order to follow the [[human rights]] situation in these countries and document further cases of violations to submit to the [[UN]]. Alkarama's website was launched the same year.

=== 2007: Alkarama Foundation ===

In April 2007, in the face of an ever-increasing workload and in order to undertake the necessary changes in capital and human resources, Alkarama registers as a Foundation under [[Swiss]] law. This change in status aimed to ensure greater stability and transparency, by enabling the Swiss authorities to review the organisation's financial records on a yearly basis.

=== 2007: Working with UN Treaty Bodies ===

As of 2007, Alkarama began working with the UN Human Rights Treaty Bodies – in particular the [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee Against Torture]] (CAT), the [[Human Rights Committee]] (HRCttee) and the [[Universal Periodic Review]] (UPR) instituted by the newly established [[Human Rights Council]] (HRC) – by submitting alternative information regarding the Arab State's implementation of the relevant treaties at every stage of their review process. In doing so, Alkarama provides the CAT and HRCttee expert, as well as members of the (HRC) access to information from [[civil society]] actors as well as concrete cases of violations of numerous articles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[Convention Against Torture]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR).

=== 2009: Working to strengthen [[national human rights institutions]] ===

In 2009, facing the increasingly negative roles played by [[National Human Rights Institutions]] (NHRIs), Alkarama begins providing independent information from local civil society actors about these institutions to the International Coordinating Committee on (ICC-NHRIs), which regularly reviews the status of these institutions, resulting in a number of reforms within these institutions.

=== 2009: Launch of the Alkarama Award for [[Human Rights Defenders]] ===

Also in 2009, Alkarama launched the Alkarama Award for Human Rights Defenders, a symbolic reward attributed every year to an individual or organisation that has significantly contributed to the promotion and protection of human rights in the Arab world (to read more about the Award and the previous laureates, click here). Through this award, Alkarama was able to fulfill two objectives: to bring attention to the work of Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) in the Arab world, whilst providing the UN, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the media, and the general public an opportunity to learn about the individual heroes struggling for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Arab region.

=== 2011 (During the "[[Arab Spring]]" and after): Acting as a major relay of information ===

As the events of 2011 began to unfold in the [[Arab World]], Alkarama stood alongside those calling for the respect of their rights and became a major relay of information for the UN mechanisms and the media, on the uprisings in [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], [[Yemen]] and then [[Syria]]. With Country Representatives in [[Egypt]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Yemen]], as well as several visits to [[Libya]], Alkarama was able to closely monitor the violations occurring, reporting them in real time whilst raising awareness amongst the new groups rising to power of their obligation to respect [[human rights]].

===Alkarama Today===

Alkarama today is made up of nine full-time employees in [[Geneva]], and five representatives in the [[Arab World]]. It also trains about 10 interns per year in its Legal or Media Departments.

Although founded in 2004 as a society, since 2007 Alkarama has been a registered Swiss [[Foundation (nonprofit)|Foundation]].

Alkarama is a [[Multilingualism|trilingual]] organisation, publishing material in Arabic, English and French.

==Alleged link to terrorist groups==
As an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] working on a daily basis with the [[United Nations]] human rights protection mechanisms by submitting to these UN bodies detailed information on serious human rights violations committed by States in the region, Alkarama has often been the victim of defamation campaigns, whilst several members of its staff have been targeted  – in their own capacity and not necessarily because of their relation with Alkarama – such as Executive Director, [[Mourad Dhina]] and Legal Director, [[Rachid Mesli]], both victims of international arrest warrants issued by the Algerian government; as well as founding member and former Chairman of the Foundation’s Council, [[Abdulrahman al-Nuaimi|Abdulrahman Al Naimi]], listed by the [[United States|U.S.]] Treasury as an “[[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]] financier” although the charges were never substantiated.

Among others, on 2 September 2014, the Lebanese newspaper, As-Safir published an article entitled [http://www.assafir.com/Article/1/369665 The Founder of the Cham Al Islam movement, a prominent activist within Alkarama], which openly accuses Alkarama of "supporting terrorism" and "spreading anarchy". In the following couple of days, these allegations were echoed in the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese information channel, [http://www.almanar.com.lb/adetails.php?eid=953720&amp;cid=31&amp;fromval=1 Al Manar], in Syrian governmental news sites, [http://www.rtv.gov.sy/index.php?d=100284&amp;id=157903 RTV.gov] and [http://thawra.alwehda.gov.sy/_View_news2.asp?FileName=72957552320140903013614 Al Tawra], as well as in Saudi-run news site on Syria, [http://www.day-news.net/news/46963.html Al Akhbar Al Youm]. On 3 September, [[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]], a magazine founded by the [[American Jewish Committee]] in 1945, accused Alkarama of being run by an "[[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]] financier", in reference to Alkarama's Founder, Mr Abdulrahman Al Naimi.

On 14 October 2014, the Swiss newspaper, [[Le Temps]] published an article entitled [https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2014/10/14/ville-geneve-finance-une-ong-accusee-liens-al-qaida The town of Geneva funded an NGO accused of links with Al Qaeda], which was relayed by other Swiss media outlets. The article relied exclusively on the unproven listing of one of Alkarama’s three founding members as an “[[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]] financier” (see below). A month later, [[Le Temps]] published a [https://www.letemps.ch/opinions/2014/11/20/difficulte-defendre-droits-homme-monde-arabe feature] by Alkarama’s Legal Director, [[Rachid Mesli]], speaking of the difficulty to defend human rights in the Arab World, explaining that in the Arab World, those who dare criticise authoritarian regimes or demand more freedom are accused of terrorism to stifle any criticism or demand to take part in the country’s political life. ''“It is therefore not surprising that Alkarama, which defends victims of this repression, finds itself vilified and attacked by these regimes; that international NGOs such as the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and [[Islamic Relief]] find themselves on the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]’s list of terrorist organisations along with [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] and [[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]]; and that the former Chairman of our Foundation, Dr Abdulrahman Al Naimi, a university Professor, a Qatari human rights activist and a former [[Amnesty International|Amnesty]] [[prisoner of conscience]] be banned from several countries – including the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] and [[Saudi Arabia]],”'' explained [[Rachid Mesli|Me Mesli]].

The current president of Alkarama’s Board of Trustees, Khalifa al-Rabban, is a Founding Member and Member of the Board of Trustees of the Global Anti-Aggression Campaign (GAAC) alongside Abdulrahman Al Naimi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.alkarama.org/our-people |title=Alkarama's Board and Staff members - Alkarama Foundation |access-date=2016-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410034243/http://en.alkarama.org/our-people |archivedate=2016-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Master"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ar.qawim.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=201&amp;Itemid=35|title=Qawim Arabic Website - مجلس أمناء الحملة|last=Master|first=Hamla Web|website=ar.qawim.net|access-date=2016-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331135321/http://ar.qawim.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=201&amp;Itemid=35|archive-date=2016-03-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online portal for articles on human-rights matters in the Arab World, the GAAC’s founding statement, written by Alkarama founding member Abdulrahman Al Naimi, claims that Islam is under siege and that the organisation seeks to confront the Western “aggressor.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ar.qawim.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=180&amp;Itemid=34|title=Qawim Arabic Website - البيان التأسيسي|last=Master|first=Hamla Web|website=ar.qawim.net|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; GAAC has also hosted Hamas leaders.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7895485.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Middle East {{!}} Clerics urge new jihad over Gaza|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://arabi21.com/story/887784/%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%89-%D9%8A%D8%AE%D8%AA%D8%AA%D9%85-%D9%81%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%84|title=مؤتمر "نصرة الأقصى" يختتم فعالياته باسطنبول|newspaper=عربي21|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alkarama unambiguously and irrevocably denies all these accusations, but the Foundation can only work in a spirit of full transparency. You can find details of its cases below.

=== 2012: Arrest and detention of [[Mourad Dhina]] in Paris ===
In 2012, Alkarama's Executive Director, Dr [[Mourad Dhina]], who had openly called for democratic change in [[Algeria]] for years was detained in [[France]] for six months on a request from the Algerian authorities to have him [[extradited]] to the country. The French court released him when they received documents from the Algerian authorities, which were so incoherent and lacking any evidence that the French prosecutor qualified them as "grotesque". Dr. Dhina returned to Alkarama after having spent almost 6 months at the [[Prison de la Santé]] in [[Paris]].

=== 2013: Listing of one of Alkarama's three founding members, Pr. Al Naimi, by the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] ===
On 18 December 2013, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|United States Department of Treasury]] listed one of Alkarama’s three founding members, Pr. Abdulrahman Al Naimi as a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” for having supposedly ''“provided money and material support and conveyed communications to [[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]] and its affiliates in [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[Somalia]] and [[Yemen]] for more than a decade.”''[[# ftn1|[1]]]  In addition, the U.S. Treasury claimed that Naimi had “reportedly oversaw the transfer of over $2 million per month to al-Qa’ida in Iraq for a period of time” and “served as an interlocutor between al-Qaida in Iraq leaders and Qatar-based donors.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2249.aspx|title=Treasury Designates Al-Qa’ida Supporters in Qatar and Yemen|website=www.treasury.gov|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to the [[Financial Times]] from [[Istanbul]], Al Naimi denied the charges leveled against him.[[# ftn2|[2]]]  Al Naimi is also a secretary general of the Global Anti-Aggression Campaign, an online NGO that has hosted [[Hamas]] leaders and released anti-Semitic and anti-Western writings.&lt;ref name="Master"/&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ar.qawim.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8578&amp;Itemid=1|title=Qawim Arabic Website - الجذور العقدية لقرارات الغرب ومن يواليهم بحق قضايا الأمة الإسلامية|last=Master|first=Hamla Web|website=ar.qawim.net|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ar.qawim.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=180&amp;Itemid=36|title=Qawim Arabic Website - البيان التأسيسي|last=Master|first=Hamla Web|website=ar.qawim.net|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the listing, Pr. Al Naimi resigned from the Foundation to avoid any misinterpretation. However, the Alkarama Council decided to reject the resignation of Mr. Al Naimi after initially accepting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.alkarama.org/press-releases-k2/1187-press-release-by-the-council-of-the-alkarama-foundation|title=Press release by the Council of the Alkarama Foundation - Alkarama Foundation|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, Naimi stepped down as President and Member of the Board of Alkarama.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.shab.ch/shabforms/servlet/Search?EID=7&amp;DOCID=1641359&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note, however, that the charges brought by the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] against him were made against his own person, and not the Foundation. Besides, the U.S. Treasury has not submitted any evidence or proof of its allegations against Pr Al Naimi, who denies all charges as a whole, and is willing, as he officially notified the American authorities, to appear in person before a court to establish the falsity of the charges pressed against him. Al Naimi has, however, received widespread media coverage for his support to terrorist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/qatar/11110928/Former-head-of-human-rights-charity-accused-of-leading-double-life-as-terrorist-fundraiser.html|title=Former head of human rights charity accused of leading double life as terrorist fundraiser|last=Spencer|first=By David Blair and Richard|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/11156327/Al-Qaeda-terror-financier-worked-for-Qatari-government.html|title=Al-Qaeda terror financier worked for Qatari government|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/10/rich-little-qatar-big-ugly-ties-to-terror.html|title=U.S. Ally Qatar Shelters Jihadi Moneymen|last=Dettmer|first=Jamie|date=2014-12-10|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/20/terrorists-for-human-rights.html|title=Terrorists for Human Rights|last=Lake|first=Eli|date=2013-12-20|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2014: Listing of Alkarama as a terrorist organisation by the [[United Arab Emirates]] ===
On 15 November 2014, the [[Emirates News Agency]] released a list of 85 organisations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wam.ae/en/news/emirates-international/1395272478814.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130052552/http://www.wam.ae/en/news/emirates-international/1395272478814.html |archive-date=2016-01-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''“designated as terrorist organisations and groups in implementation of Federal Law No. 7 for 2014 on combating terrorist crimes”'' issued by Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nayhan with the aim to ''“raise awareness in society about these organisations.”''

The list, which includes internationally recognised terrorist organisations, such as [[Al-Qaeda]] or Dae’sh (the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] - ISIL), also includes several Muslim associations in Europe and international NGOs, such as the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) and [[Islamic Relief]]. “Alkarama organisation” also appears in that list, but despite numerous attempts to contact Emirati officials on this matter, the Alkarama Foundation never received an official confirmation and therefore considers itself not concerned by that listing.

=== 2015: Arrest of [[Rachid Mesli]] in Italy ===
Me Rachid Mesli, Legal Director at Alkarama, was arrested at the Swiss-Italian border on 19 August 2015 on the basis of an [[Interpol notice|international arrest warrant]] issued by the Algerian authorities in April 2002, which claims that he had ''"provided telephone information to terrorist groups movements,"'' and ''"attempted to supply terrorist groups with cameras and phones,"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.alkarama.org/1834-alkarama-s-legal-director-detained-in-italy-on-the-basis-of-algerian-arrest-warrant|title=Alkarama's Legal Director Detained in Italy on the Basis of Algerian Arrest Warrant - Alkarama Foundation|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; twisting his work as a human rights lawyer, in constant contact with victims of human rights abuses and their families.

On 22 August, the Italian justice decided to put him under house arrest instead of keeping him in Aosta prison, following several calls from various [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], institutions and personalities, as well as an important media coverage of his case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.alkarama.org/component/k2/1865-court-lifts-restrictive-measure-of-house-arrest-against-rachid-mesli?Itemid=|title=Court Lifts Restrictive Measure of House Arrest against Rachid Mesli - Alkarama Foundation|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 2015, recognizing Me Mesli's important work in the promotion and protection of human rights in the Arab World, as well as the strong risks of [[torture]] that he would incur if he was extradited to [[Algeria]], the [[Turin]] Court decided to release him without waiting for the end of the 40-day period by which the Algerian authorities can submit their formal request for [[extradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.alkarama.org/component/k2/1866-turin-court-of-appeal-authorises-rachid-mesli-to-leave-italy?Itemid=|title=Turin Court of Appeal Authorises Rachid Mesli to Leave Italy - Alkarama Foundation|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, on 16 December 2015, the Italian court rejected the extradition request after noting all the inconsistencies in the [[Interpol notice|international arrest warrant]]. The court considered the charges against Me Mesli were the result of ''"political persecution"'' and asserted that ''"his human rights activities have nothing to do with terrorism."''&lt;ref name="en.alkarama.org"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.alkarama.org/component/k2/2130-interpol-withdraws-the-international-arrest-warrant-by-algeria-against-the-lawyer-rachid-mesli?Itemid=|title=Interpol Withdraws International Arrest Warrant by Algeria Against Lawyer Rachid Mesli - Alkarama Foundation|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And on 13 May 2016, the [[Interpol notice#Commission for the Control of Interpol.27s Files .28.22CCF.22.29|Commission for the Control of Interpol's Files]] decided, after a long legal battle, to drop the [[Interpol notice|international arrest warrant]] issued in 2003 by the Algerian authorities against Me Mesli, for their lack of cooperation as well as their failure to provide any form of clarification on his case.&lt;ref name="en.alkarama.org"/&gt;

== Advocacy on behalf of terrorism supporters ==
In April 2004, Alkarama issued a report condemning the arrest by Qatari authorities of a number of individuals with ties to terrorism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anhri.net/mena/achr/pr040426.shtml|title=حول الاعتقال التعسفي في قطر|website=www.anhri.net|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alkarama Foundation report did not mention their activities in support of terrorism but called on Qatar to release the arbitrarily detained individuals. The report listed [[Ibrahim Issa al-Bakr]], [[Salim al-Kuwari|Salim Hasan al-Kuwari]], [[Abd al-Latif Bin Abdullah Salih Muhammad al-Kawari]], [[Khalid Saeed al-Bounein]] and others as the detainees which Alkarama demanded be released.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The U.S. Treasury claimed that in the early 2000s, when Alkarama released its advocacy report, Ibrahim Issa al-Bakr was “working to raise money to support terrorism” and was involved in a jihadist network.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2651.aspx|title=Treasury Designates Twelve Foreign Terrorist Fighter Facilitators|website=www.treasury.gov|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the U.S. government designated Ibrahim Issa al-Bakr as an al-Qaeda supporter and Specially Designated Global Terrorist who worked with a Lebanon-based network to procure and transport weapons to Syria with the help of an al-Qaeda associate in Syria.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In January 2015, al-Bakr was added by the United Nations to the al-Qaeda Sanctions List of individuals subject to an assets freeze and travel ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc11750.doc.htm|title=Security Council Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee Adds Four Names to Its Sanctions List {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salim Hasan al-Kuwari is a Qatari national and US-designated financier and facilitator of al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1261.aspx|title=Treasury Targets Key Al-Qa’ida Funding and Support Network Using Iran as a Critical Transit Point|website=www.treasury.gov|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Treasury claimed that Kuwari supports al-Qaeda through Iran-based al-Qaeda associates and has provided “hundreds of thousands of dollars in financial support to al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2009, Alkarama submitted Kuwari’s case to the [[Working Group on Arbitrary Detention|UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD).]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.alkarama.org/qatar/387-qatar-abdullah-khowar-and-salem-al-kuwari-arbitrarily-detained-since-six-months|title=Qatar: Abdullah Khowar and Salem Al-Kuwari arbitrarily detained since six months - Alkarama Foundation|access-date=2016-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117070733/http://en.alkarama.org/qatar/387-qatar-abdullah-khowar-and-salem-al-kuwari-arbitrarily-detained-since-six-months|archive-date=2016-11-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11241">The '''Argus finals systems''' were a set of related systems of end-of-season championship [[playoff]] [[tournament]] used commonly in [[Australian rules football]] competitions in the early part of the 20th century. The systems generally comprised a simple four-team tournament, followed by the right of the top ranked team from the home-and-away season to challenge for the premiership. The systems were named after the Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'', which developed and supported their use.

==First Argus system==
In 1901, the [[Victorian Football League (1897–1989)|Victorian Football League]] first adopted the "Argus system", after issues had emerged with the fairness of the system which had been introduced in [[1898 VFL finals series|1898]].

The initial Argus system was, in effect, a simple four-team [[knock-out tournament]], played as follows:
* Week One: the First Semi-Final was played between '''2nd''' vs '''4th''', and the Second Semi-Final was played between '''1st''' vs '''3rd'''.
* Week Two: the [[AFL Grand Final|final]] was played between '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; SF1&lt;/sub&gt;''' vs '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; SF2&lt;/sub&gt;'''
** The winner of this match became the '''Major Premier''' for the season.

==First amended Argus system==

The major complaint about the Argus system used in 1901 was that the four qualifying teams had a statistically equal chance to win the premiership. This particularly displeased Geelong, who had won the [[Minor premiership|minor premiership]], but were eliminated when beaten by Collingwood in the Second Semi-Final.

To prevent this situation, the VFL re-introduced a provision which had existed under the [[1898 VFL finals system|1898 system]]: after the simple knock-out tournament was completed, the team with the best win-loss record for the season would have the opportunity to challenge the winner of the knock-out tournament to a Grand Final for the premiership.&lt;ref name="egep"&gt;{{citation|first=Stephen|last=Rodgers|title=Every Game Ever Played: VFL/AFL Results, 1897–1991|publisher=Viking O'Neil|publication-place=Ringwood, VIC|edition=3rd|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This variant of the Argus system was played as follows:
* Week One: the First Semi-Final was played between '''2nd''' vs '''4th''', and the Second Semi-Final was played between '''1st''' vs '''3rd'''.
* Week Two: a final was played between '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; SF1&lt;/sub&gt;''' vs '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; SF2&lt;/sub&gt;'''
**If the winner of the Week Two final had the best record in the league across all matches, ''including all finals up to and including Week Two'', then that team became the '''Major Premier''' for the season. In these cases, the final in week two has retrospectively become known as the Grand Final.
**If the winner of the Week Two final did not have the best record in the league as defined above, then the finals progressed to Week Three.
* Week Three: the Grand Final was played between '''Team with the best record''' vs '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; Final&lt;/sub&gt;'''
** The winner of this match became the '''Major Premier''' for the season.

It is important to note that under this variant of the ''Argus'' System, the right to challenge did ''not'' automatically go to the [[minor premiership|minor premiers]], ''i.e.'' the team which was ranked highest after the home-and-away season. If the minor premiership had been decided by a close margin, then any losses sustained during the finals could have cost the minor premier its right to challenge or even transferred it to another team.

An example of how this could have happened occurred in the 1906 VFL season: leading into the [[1906 VFL Grand Final|Final]], Carlton had an overall record of 15–3, and Fitzroy had an overall record of 14–4, but Fitzroy had a superior percentage to Carlton.

Had Carlton lost the Final to Fitzroy, both teams would have had a record of 15–4, but Fitzroy would have been ranked above Carlton with its superior percentage, and Carlton therefore would have lost the right of challenge, meaning that Fitzroy would win the premiership. As it happened, Carlton won the Final, giving them a record of 16–3 compared with Fitzroy's 14–5, so Fitzroy had no right of challenge, and Carlton won the premiership.

Many Carlton players and officials, including coach Jack Worrall, erroneously believed that they would have had the right to challenge had they lost the Final. This confusion led to Carlton lodging a complaint with the VFL, and the VFL made further amendments in 1907 to correct for this anomaly.&lt;ref name="egep" /&gt;

==Second amended Argus system==
The second version of the amended Argus system was used by the VFL between 1907 and 1930, except in [[1924 VFL season|1924]]. This is the most widely known variation of the Argus system.

The structure of the finals was mostly the same as the first amended Argus system, except that the right to challenge was given to the '''Minor Premier''' as defined by the team on top of the ladder at the end of the home-and-away season. Additionally, it became conventional for the two semi-finals to be played on separate weekends, extending the duration of the finals from two or three weeks to three or four weeks.

* Week One: the First Semi-Final was played between '''2nd''' vs '''4th'''.
* Week Two: the Second Semi-Final was played between '''1st''' vs '''3rd'''.
* Week Three: a final was played between '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; SF1&lt;/sub&gt;''' vs '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; SF2&lt;/sub&gt;'''
**If '''Minor Premier''' won the Week Three final, then that team was immediately awarded the '''Major Premiership'''. In these cases, the final in week three has retrospectively become known as the Grand Final.
**If the winner of the Week Three final was not the Minor Premier, then the finals progress to Week Four. The final in week three became known as either the Final or the Preliminary Final.
* Week Four: the Grand Final was played between '''Minor Premier''' vs '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; Final&lt;/sub&gt;'''
** The winner of this match became the '''Major Premier''' for the season.

This variation of the Argus system was introduced into the VFA in 1903,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article9825227 |title=FOOTBALL. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]  |location=Melbourne |date=28 March 1903 |accessdate=4 March 2015 |page=18 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; four years before it was used in the VFL, being used by that competition until 1932,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Barrier Miner|publication-place=Broken Hill, NSW|date=7 January 1933|page=6|title=Central ground for Victorian Assn.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used in [[Australian Amateur Football Council|amateur football]] until 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Best of Football Trivia|author=Marc Fiddian|year=2003|publisher=Galaxy Print and Design|publication-place=Hastings, VIC|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Round-robin Argus system==
For the [[1924 VFL season|1924 season]] only, the VFL trialled a new format, in which the finals were played as a four-team round-robin, but including the Minor Premiers' right to challenge. At the end of the home-and-away season, the top four teams qualified for the finals tournament.

The finals were played over three weeks (with a provision for a fourth week), under the fixture:
*Week one: '''1st''' vs '''3rd'''; '''2nd''' vs '''4th'''
*Week two: '''1st''' vs '''2nd'''; '''3rd''' vs '''4th'''
*Week three: '''1st''' vs '''4th'''; '''2nd''' vs '''3rd'''

At the conclusion of the first three weeks, if the '''Minor Premier''' had finished on top of the round-robin ladder, then that team automatically won the '''Major Premiership''', but if another team won the round-robin competition, then the finals progressed to Week Four.

* Week Four: the Grand Final was played between '''Minor Premier''' vs '''1st&lt;sub&gt; Round robin&lt;/sub&gt;'''

The winner of this match became the '''Major Premier''' for the season.

In the sole VFL season that the system was used, no Grand Final was ultimately required.&lt;ref name="egep" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{See also|McIntyre System}}
After having utilised four variations of the Argus system for thirty years, three clear drawbacks had emerged:
*Firstly, there was uncertainty regarding if there would be three or four finals played.&lt;ref&gt;Four finals were played in [[1928 VFL season|1928]] as the Second Semi-Final between Collingwood and Melbourne was drawn, meaning a replay was required.&lt;/ref&gt; This had resulted, to some extent, in the crowd for at least one of the Semi-Finals or the Final exceeding that of the Grand Final in nine of the 29 seasons that the system was used, including seven of the eleven seasons between 1919–1923 and 1925–1930.&lt;ref&gt;Essendon won the round-robin series in 1924, meaning that no Grand Final was required.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Secondly, the minor premier was now seen to have an unfair advantage through its right to challenge to the point where losing the Second Semi-Final could be seen as a preferable route to a premiership: a loss allowed for a week off, while a win would require the minor premier to play on the following weekend.&lt;ref name="egep" /&gt; 
*Thirdly, there was a clear financial benefit to the clubs involved for a Challenge (or Grand) Final to be played, as it required another match to be played, bringing with it additional gate takings. As such, it was a common perception that clubs would contrive results to achieve this, leading to concern amongst the media, fans and officials that the Semi-Finals were not genuine contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10340822 |title=THE FOOTBALL PREMIERSHIP. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=19 September 1904 |accessdate=14 October 2014 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To correct for these flaws, the VFL introduced a new system in 1931, the [[Page–McIntyre system]], that removed the minor premiers' right to challenge in favour of giving the minor premier and the second-placed team the advantage of a "double chance" that permitted either team to lose one match (excluding the Grand Final) without being eliminated, and fixed the number of finals at four.

All leagues using the Argus system eventually migrated to the Page–McIntyre system, with amateur football being the last to do so in 1956.

'''Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre''' ('''AUSTRAC''') is an Australian government [[financial intelligence]] agency set up to monitor financial transactions to identify [[Money laundering#Enforcement|money laundering]], [[organised crime]], [[tax evasion]], [[welfare fraud]] and [[Terrorism in Australia|terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/ar-14-15-austrac-at-a-glance |title=AUSTRAC at a glance |access-date=25 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828034700/http://austrac.gov.au/ar-14-15-austrac-at-a-glance |archive-date=28 August 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; AUSTRAC was established in 1989 under the ''Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw%5Cmanagement.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200403474?OpenDocument Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988], at [[ComLaw]]&lt;/ref&gt; to implement in Australia the recommendations of the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF), which Australia joined in 1990. 

AUSTRAC's existence was continued under the ''Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006'' (Cth) (AML/CTF Act).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/alacfa2006522/ | title=''Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006'' (Cth)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AML/CTF Act came into effect on 12 December 2006,&lt;ref name=parlinfo-terror-finance&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R2654|website=parlinfo.aph.gov.au|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extended the existing monitoring regime to cover financing of terrorism and listed terrorist organisations. Under Division 103 of the ''Criminal Code Act 1995'' (Cth), it is illegal to finance terrorism.&lt;ref name="Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth)"&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2014C00793/Html/Volume_1#_Toc405451547 Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) s 1.1], Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). Retrieved 20 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]] maintains a list of [[Outlawed terror organisations in Australia|outlawed terror organisations]]. In 2014 AUSTRAC released a report, ''Terrorism financing in Australia 2014'', which says, "Terrorism financing poses a serious threat to Australians and Australian interests at home and abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/publications/corporate-publications-and-reports/terrorism-financing-australia-2014  |title=Terrorism financing in Australia 2014 |year=2014|work=AUSTRAC|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AUSTRAC is a member of the [[Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units]] and an observer in the [[Camden Assets Recovery Interagency Network]] and is a member of FATF and the [[Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes]]. 

Certain classes of financial services are required to be reported to AUSTRAC, in particular bank cash transactions (i.e., [[banknote|note]]s and [[coin]]s) of [[Australian dollar|A]]$10,000 or more, as well as suspicious transactions and all international transfers. Reports to AUSTRAC must be made within 10 business days.&lt;ref name=Age030817 /&gt; The information that AUSTRAC collects is available for use by law enforcement, revenue, regulatory, security and other agencies.

== Operation ==
"Reporting entities" are required to report transactions to AUSTRAC. Transactions which must be reported include:

* cash transactions of A$10,000 or more, or foreign currency of that value,
* international funds transfer instructions, either into or out of Australia, of any amount, and
* suspicious transactions of any kind, being transactions the dealer may reasonably suspect of being part of [[tax evasion]] or crime, or might assist in a [[prosecution]].

Australia's [[cash controls]] require travellers to report to AUSTRAC when they carry $10,000 or more (or equivalent in a foreign currency) of cash (or equivalent) into or out of Australia, which can be done on forms available from the [[Australian Border Force|Border Force]] at airports and [[sea port]]s. The Border Force attempts to detect evasion of this requirement. Airlines are not liable for what their passengers carry. Cross-border movement of bearer negotiable instruments of any amount must also be reported if requested by a Border Force or police officer.

It's an offence under the Act for anyone to [[structuring|split a transaction]] into two or more parts with a dominant purpose of avoiding the reporting rules and thresholds.

Certain classes of transactions are exempt, or may be exempted on application. For example, established customers transacting amounts typical of their lawful business, such as for [[payroll]], or retail or [[vending machine]] takings, etc. Motor vehicle traders are specifically not eligible for exemption, as are boats, farm machinery and aircraft traders.

Under the ''[[Freedom of Information Act 1982]]'', any person can access records held by AUSTRAC, subject to certain exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austrac.gov.au/freedom_of_information.html Freedom of Information Guidelines page] at AUSTRAC web site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=''Freedom of information Act 1982'' (Cth)|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/foia1982222/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporting entities==
Entities which are required to report transactions to AUSTRAC are called "reporting entities", which are specified in the AML/CTF Act. These entities deal in cash, bullion and financial transactions, and include:

* banks and similar [[financial institution]]s, such as [[building societies]]
* corporations
* [[insurance companies]] and intermediaries
* securities dealers, such as [[brokerage firm|stock broker]]s
* [[unit trust]] managers and trustees (but cash management trusts transacting only by cheque or similar are exempt)
* [[traveler's cheque]] or money order issuers
* cash carriers and [[payroll]] preparation businesses
* [[casino]]s
* [[bookmaker]]s, including [[totalisator]] agencies
* [[bullion]] dealers
* solicitors, acting on their own behalf (e.g., their trust fund, or originated [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]])

== Identification ==
Reporting entities must identify their customers using the [[100-point check]] system.  Accounts may only be opened, but can only be operated (i.e., withdrawals made) by an identified customer; an unidentified customer is blocked from making withdrawals.  Generally identification can be transferred from one account to another, so that for instance a person once identified does not need to produce documents again when opening a second account at the same institution.

For banks and similar reporting entities, identification requirements are determined by a risk-based approach, which may differ for each reporting entity.

It's an offence to open or operate an account with a reporting entity under an [[Pseudonym|alias]] or false name, punishable by a fine or up to 2 years imprisonment.

== Other agencies ==
The information that AUSTRAC collects is also available to a large number of government agencies, including:

* [[Australian Taxation Office]] (ATO)
* State and territory revenue offices
* [[Child Support Agency Australia]] (CSA)
* [[Australian Federal Police]] (AFP), and which may then communicate information to foreign law enforcement agencies, with appropriate undertakings
* [[Law enforcement in Australia#State|State and territory police services]]
* [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO)
* [[Australian Crime Commission]]
* [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] (ASIC)
* [[Department of Home Affairs (Australia)|Department of Home Affairs]], Australia
* [[Centrelink]] (added in 2004)
* State commissions and royal commissions against corruption –
** [[Crime and Misconduct Commission]], Queensland
** [[Corruption and Crime Commission]], Western Australia (added in 2004)
** [[Independent Commission Against Corruption of New South Wales|Independent Commission Against Corruption]], New South Wales
** [[New South Wales Crime Commission]]
** [[Police Integrity Commission]], New South Wales
* Foreign countries, with appropriate undertakings.

== Enforcement ==
One prominent attempted evasion of the AUSTRAC rules took place ahead of the Dutch takeover of TNT (see [[TNT N.V.]]) in 1999.  [[Simon Hannes]] was an executive at [[Macquarie Bank]], which was advising TNT, and he bought about $90,000 of TNT call options under the name "Mark Booth" to profit when the bid was announced.  He was convicted of [[insider trading]] but also of two offences under the Financial Transactions Reports Act since he had made multiple cash withdrawals and deposits each just under the $10,000 threshold, apparently to avoid that reporting. His sentence for those transactions was 4 months jail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic_pub.nsf/byheadline/02%2F452+Simon+Hannes+sentenced:+two+and+a+half+years+jail?openDocument ''Simon Hannes sentenced: two and a half years jail'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050721142201/http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic_pub.nsf/byheadline/02/452%2BSimon%2BHannes%2Bsentenced%3A%2Btwo%2Band%2Ba%2Bhalf%2Byears%2Bjail?openDocument |date=21 July 2005 }}, press release by the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] on 13 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/supreme_ct/2002/1182.html R v Hannes (2002)], [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]] report, at [[AustLII]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, an investigation carried out by officers of AUSTRAC and other agencies determined that funds were being sent from Australia for use by the Somalia-based terrorist group, [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]].  Money was remitted, with false names used to obscure the money trail. This investigation lead to the ultimate arrest of the suspects on charges of conspiring to commit a terrorist attack on an [[Holsworthy Barracks terror plot|Australian army base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/book/export/html/508#Case21|title=Case studies – Remittance services (money transfers): Case 21 – Australian terror suspects sent funds to Somalia to support terrorist group |work=[[AUSTRAC]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, Australian authorities feared that money being transferred from Australia to Somalia could be used for [[Terrorism in Somalia|terrorist purposes]]. In 2015, Australian banks ceased to provide money-transfer facilities to Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-17/somali-australians-plead-with-westpac-to-not-close/5822138  |title=Somali Australians plead with Westpac to not close remittance accounts |author=McGrath, Pat|date=17 October 2014|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/east/westpac-to-stop-somali-money-transfers-on-march-31/story-fngnvlxu-1227281376048  |title=Westpac to stop Somali money transfers on March 31 |author=Armitage, Laura|date=30 March 2015|work=[[Herald Sun]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August 2017, AUSTRAC took action against the [[Commonwealth Bank]] alleging that it did not report cash transactions over $10,000 within the required 10 business day period, or at all. The alleged breach involves over 53,700 transactions over $10,000 through a type of ATM that allowed anonymous cash deposits up to $20,000.&lt;ref name=Age030817&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/austrac-alleges-cba-in-serious-breach-of-money-laundering-act-20170803-gxoirw.html  |title=Austrac alleges CBA in 'serious' breach of money laundering act |author=Clancy Yeates |date=3 August 2017 |work=The Age |accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss banking secrecy was first codified with the [[Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks|Banking Act of 1934]] which made it a crime to disclose client information to third parties without their consent. The law, coupled with a stable Swiss currency and international neutrality, prompted large capital flight to private Swiss accounts. During the 1940s, [[Numbered bank account|numbered bank accounts]] were introduced creating an enduring principle of bank secrecy that continues to be considered one of the main aspects of [[private banking]] globally. Advances in [[financial cryptography]] (via [[public-key cryptography]]) could make it possible to use anonymous electronic money and anonymous digital bearer certificates for financial privacy and [[anonymous Internet banking]], given enabling institutions and secure computer systems.

The '''Bengali Language Movement''' in Manbhum was a movement in [[Manbhum]] district, present day [[Purulia district]] of West Bengal state, during the late 1940s to mid-1950s, to fight for [[Bengali language]] and to protest against the forcible imposition of [[Hindi language]] to the Bengali speaking people.

== Background ==
In 1765, the nominal Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]] was defeated to the [[British East India Company]] in the [[Battle of Buxar]]. He granted "Diwani" (right to collect revenue) of Bengal (which included [[Bihar]] to the East India Company.{{cn|date=April 2014}} The East India Company started Tax-Collection process in the Jungal-Mahal area. To have a greater Control over the area, East India Company split the area into smaller districts like Panchet (1773), Jungle-Mahal (1805) and Manbhum (1833).{{cn|date=April 2014}} The Manbhum District was formed with an area of 7,896 square miles. The district of Manbhum was again split in 1845, 1846, 1871 and finally in 1879, and as a result the area of Manbhum was reduced to 4,112 square miles.&lt;ref name="purulia.gov.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purulia.nic.in/distAdmin/departments/dico/bhasa_andolon.html|title=HISTORICAL EVENT: BHASA ANDOLON|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Partition of Bengal was started in 1905, and, as an effect of that, a new state, Bihar-Odisha, was formed. The Manbhum District was included to the Bihar-Odisha. The whole district started protesting against the inclusion. The language movement or Bhasa Andolon had started as a demand to include Manbhum District as a part of Bengal.&lt;ref name="purulia.gov.in" /&gt;

== Early days of movement ==
At the time of [[independence of India]] in 1947, Manbhum district was a part of Bihar. From 1948 Bengali speaking peoples of Manbhum district started suffering as restrictions on Bengali language as well as forcible imposition of Hindi language over Bengali speaking people had started. Bengali officers of Manbhum district were transferred to the others districts of Bihar, D.I. of school issued notice to teach Hindi from Primary classes, Bengali department was closed in zilla school. Installation of notice board in Hindi language become Compulsory for the schools and business establishment. Presenting the Domicile Certificate became mandatory for the Bengalis of Manbhum District. Hindi was declared as official language of Manbhum District.&lt;ref name="purulia.gov.in" /&gt;

== The Movement ==
After seeing the plight of Bengali speaking people, a proposal to make the Bengali as the language of Manbhum district has given. But it was defeated in 43–55&lt;ref name="purulia.gov.in" /&gt; at the Congress Party on 30 May 1948. On 14 June 1948 the Lok Sevak Sangha was established to protect Bengali Language as well as to fight for forcible imposition of Hindi Language over the Bengali Language as the state policy of the then Bihar government. The government restricted the use of Bengali language in education to the Bengali speaking people of Manbhum District. The government banned rallies also. All these incident sparked the protest to the fullest in Manbhum District.

Lok Sevak Sangha started the agitation in various level.

* Satyagraha Andolan (Non-violent agitation) (1949–1951)
* Hal Joal Andolan
* Tusu Satyagraha Andolan (9 Jan – 8 Feb 1954)
   
Thousands of Bengali people of Manbhum district with the song ''Shun Bihari-bhai / Tora Rakhte Larbi / Dang Dekhai… … (O Bihari-brothers/ You cannot keep us in Bihar / We are showing you sticks… …)'' went to jail. The Bar association, Purulia Municipality and Communist party also joined this agitation.&lt;ref name="purulia.gov.in" /&gt;

== Post Movement Effect ==
As an effect of this agitation a commission named "State Re Organization Commission" was set up by the Central government on 23 December 1953. The Commission held hearing in Manbhum district on 5 February 1955 and submitted its report on 10 October 1955. In its report the commission proposed the formation of a new district "Purulia", primarily dominated by Bengali speaking people to West Bengal from erstwhile Manbhum district of Bihar.The new Purulia district comprised 19 Police stations from the then Manbhum district. But as a Special request from TISCO the then Chief minister of West Bengal, Dr. Bidhan Chndra Roy gave consent for accession of three police station (Patamda, Ichagarh and Chandil) to the Bihar.

On 1 November 1956 with 16 Police stations, 2007 square mile area and with a population of {{formatnum:1169097}} the new district Purulia was acceded to West Bengal.&lt;ref name="purulia.gov.in" /&gt;

The term '''conditioned emotional response''' ''(CER)'' can refer to a specific learned behavior or a procedure commonly used in classical or Pavlovian conditioning research. It may also be called "conditioned suppression" or "conditioned fear response (CFR)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil|title=Psychology the Science of Behaviour [4th Canadian ed.]|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, On. Canada|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|pages=423}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an "emotional response" that results from [[classical conditioning]], usually from the association of a relatively neutral stimulus with a painful or fear-inducing unconditional stimulus. As a result, the formerly neutral stimulus elicits fear. For example, if seeing a dog (a neutral stimulus) is paired with the pain of being bitten by the dog (unconditioned stimulus), seeing a dog may become a conditioned stimulus that elicits fear (conditioned response).

In 1920 [[John B. Watson]] and Rosalie Rayner demonstrated such fear conditioning in the [[Little Albert experiment]]. They started with a 9-month boy called “Albert”, who was unemotional but was made to cry by the loud noise (unconditioned stimulus) of a hammer striking a steel bar.  Albert initially showed no fear of a white rat (neutral stimulus), but after the sight of the rat had been accompanied five times by the loud noise, he cried and tried to escape the rat, showing that the rat had become a conditioned stimulus for fear. Although the Watson and Rayner work with Little Albert clearly falls under the broad umbrella of "conditioned fear" they did not use the term CER and thought they were applying more general conditioning principles to human behavior.

In 1941 [[B.F. Skinner]] and [[William Kaye Estes]] were the first to use the term "CER" and demonstrated the phenomenon with rats.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-5vx3vhstNoC&amp;pg=PA367&amp;lpg=PA367&amp;dq=conditioned+emotional+response+skinner+1941&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a-92gvoE9N&amp;sig=mZuPyMNoi97pmwpGq_yVVstEGw4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EeN5UayFBY-ArQHkmYDoBA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=conditioned%20emotional%20response%20skinner%201941&amp;f=false Principles of Learning and Behavior by Michael P. Domjan]&lt;/ref&gt;
They trained food-deprived rats to lever-press (operant conditioning) for food pellets, maintained on a variable interval (VI) schedule of reinforcement. Periodically, a tone was presented, for a brief amount of time, which co-terminated with electric shock to the metal floor (classical delay conditioning). The rats, upon receipt of the first shock, displayed the expected unconditional responses to the shock (e.g., jumping, squealing, urinating, etc.), however with subsequent presentations of the tone-shock trials, those responses habituated somewhat. The largest change in behavior occurred during the time the tone was presented. That is, lever-pressing during the tone reduced to near zero levels. Given that the tone-shock pairings were likely sufficient to produce classical conditioning, Estes and Skinner hypothesized that the tone elicited fear that interfered or interrupted ongoing operant behavior. In a sense, the now CS (tone) "paralyzed in fear" the rat. Note that the suppression of lever-pressing was robust, even though the operant, lever-press - food contingency was not altered at all. This experiment is critical in experimental psychology for it demonstrated that the interaction of classical and operant conditioning contingency could be powerful in altering behavior. This work sparked a number of experiments on this interaction, resulting in important experimental and theoretical contributions on autoshaping, negative automaintenance, and potentiated feeding, to name a few.

More importantly, the CER procedure solved a serious experimental problem in classical conditioning. In Pavlov's original demonstration of classical conditioning, he used a backward conditioning arrangement as the control condition. Briefly, in that procedure, the dogs experienced the same number of US presentations (food) and the same number of CS presentations (metronome ticking) as the experimental groups, but the timing of the CS and US presentations were reversed. The US preceded the CS, rather than the other way around. In the backward conditioning control procedure popular with Pavlov, his dogs did not salivate to the presentation of the CS, in contrast to those that received forward conditioning. However, the dogs did learn something - the presentation of the metronome predicted the absence of the food. This phenomenon we now call "conditioned inhibition." However, since Pavlov was studying conditioned excitation, by measuring drops of saliva, he could not experimentally measure the inhibition of salivation. There was a floor effect as the dogs could not salivate below 0 drops of saliva. Thus, the lack of salivation by Pavlov's dogs led him to conclude that no conditioning resulted, however, he could not measure conditioning. The CER procedure obviates this problem because conditioning is typically measured with a "suppression ratio", the ratio of responding during the CS period relative to a period of equal length but without the CS (usually immediately prior to the presentation of the CS). A measure of 0.5 indicates no conditioning, while measures that deviate from 0.5 reflect effective conditioning, relatively (0 is indicative of asymptotic conditioning). CER can, therefore, measure both conditioned excitation and conditioned inhibition.

The [[amygdala]], located in the temporal lobe, is a key brain region involved in the conditioned fear response and contributes to the autonomic, hormonal, and behavioral factors associated with that response. According to studies by Coover, Murison, &amp; Jellestad and Davis and LeDoux in 1992, when a dog's amygdala is damaged, it does not show fear, and, when tamed by human beings, the dog's stress hormone levels in the blood are lower than they are in a normal dog. Similarly, humans become less likely to report feelings of fear after their amygdala has been damaged due to injury or stroke.

The most common measure of the CFR is the [[Measures of conditioned emotional response|suppression ratio]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''countable set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] with the same [[cardinality]] ([[cardinal number|number]] of elements) as some [[subset]] of the set of [[natural number]]s. A countable set is either a [[finite set]] or a '''countably infinite''' set. Whether finite or infinite, the elements of a countable set can always be counted one at a time and, although the counting may never finish, every element of the set is associated with a unique natural number.

Some authors use countable set to mean ''countably infinite'' alone.&lt;ref name="Rudin"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudin|1976|loc=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid this ambiguity, the term ''at most countable'' may be used when finite sets are included and ''countably infinite'', ''enumerable'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kamke|1950|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''denumerable''&lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lang|1993|loc=&amp;sect;2 of Chapter I}}&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise.

[[Georg Cantor]] introduced the term ''countable set'', contrasting sets that are countable with those that are ''[[uncountable set|uncountable]]'' (i.e., ''nonenumerable'' or ''nondenumerable''&lt;ref name="Apostol"&gt;{{Harvnb|Apostol|1969|loc=Chapter 13.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Today, countable sets form the foundation of a branch of mathematics called ''[[discrete mathematics]]''.

A set {{mvar|S}} is ''countable'' if there exists an [[injective function]] {{mvar|f}} from {{mvar|S}} to the [[natural numbers]] {{math|1='''N''' = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}}}.&lt;ref&gt;Since there is an obvious [[bijection]] between {{math|'''N'''}} and {{math|1='''N'''* = {1, 2, 3, ...}}}, it makes no difference whether one considers 0  a natural number or not. In any case, this article follows [[ISO 31-11]] and the standard convention in [[mathematical logic]], which takes 0 as a natural number.&lt;/ref&gt;

If such an  {{mvar|f}} can be found that is also [[surjective function|surjective]] (and therefore [[bijection|bijective]]), then {{mvar|S}} is called ''countably [[infinite set|infinite]].''

In other words, a set is ''countably infinite'' if it has [[One-one correspondence|one-to-one correspondence]] with the natural number set, {{math|'''N'''}}.

As noted above, this terminology is not universal. Some authors use countable to mean what is here called ''countably infinite,'' and do not include finite sets.

Alternative (equivalent) formulations of the definition in terms of a [[bijective]] function or a [[surjective]] function can also be given. See below.

==History==
In 1874, in [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article|his first set theory article]], Cantor proved that the set of [[real number]]s is uncountable, thus showing that not all infinite sets are countable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Roads to Infinity: The Mathematics of Truth and Proof|first=John C.|last=Stillwell|authorlink=John Stillwell|publisher=CRC Press|year=2010|isbn=9781439865507|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XvPRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10|quote=Cantor's discovery of uncountable sets in 1874 was one of the most unexpected events in the history of mathematics. Before 1874, infinity was not even considered a legitimate mathematical subject by most people, so the need to distinguish between countable and uncountable infinities could not have been imagined.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, he used one-to-one correspondences to define and compare cardinalities.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor 1878, p.&amp;nbsp;242.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, he extended the natural numbers with his infinite [[ordinal number|ordinals]], and used sets of ordinals to produce an infinity of sets having different infinite cardinalities.&lt;ref&gt;Ferreirós 2007, pp. 268, 272&amp;ndash;273.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
A ''[[Set (mathematics)|set]]'' is a collection of ''elements'', and may be described in many ways. One way is simply to list all of its elements; for example, the set consisting of the integers 3, 4, and 5 may be denoted {3, 4, 5}. This is only effective for small sets, however; for larger sets, this would be time-consuming and error-prone. Instead of listing every single element, sometimes an ellipsis ("...") is used, if the writer believes that the reader can easily guess what is missing; for example, {1, 2, 3, ..., 100} presumably denotes the set of [[integer]]s from 1 to 100. Even in this case, however, it is still ''possible'' to list all the elements, because the set is ''finite''.

Some sets are ''infinite''; these sets have more than ''n'' elements for any integer ''n''. For example, the set of natural numbers, denotable by {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}, has infinitely many elements, and we cannot use any normal number to give its size. Nonetheless, it turns out that infinite sets do have a well-defined notion of size (or more properly, of ''cardinality'', which is the technical term for the number of elements in a set), and not all infinite sets have the same cardinality.

[[File:Aplicación 2 inyectiva sobreyectiva02.svg|thumb|x100px|Bijective mapping from integer to even numbers]]
To understand what this means, we first examine what it ''does not'' mean. For example, there are infinitely many odd integers, infinitely many even integers, and (hence) infinitely many integers overall. However, it turns out that the number of even integers, which is the same as the number of odd integers, is also the same as the number of integers overall. This is because we arrange things such that for every integer, there is a distinct even integer: ... −2→−4, −1→−2, 0→0, 1→2, 2→4, ...; or, more generally, ''n''→2''n'', see picture. What we have done here is arranged the integers and the even integers into a ''one-to-one correspondence'' (or ''[[bijection]]''), which is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that maps between two sets such that each element of each set corresponds to a single element in the other set.

However, not all infinite sets have the same cardinality. For example, [[Georg Cantor]] (who introduced this concept) demonstrated that the real numbers cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers (non-negative integers), and therefore that the set of real numbers has a greater cardinality than the set of natural numbers.

A set is ''countable'' if: (1) it is finite, or (2) it has the same cardinality (size) as the set of natural numbers. Equivalently, a set is ''countable'' if it has the same cardinality as some [[subset]] of the set of natural numbers. Otherwise, it is ''uncountable''.

==Formal overview without details==
By definition a set ''S'' is ''countable'' if there exists an [[injective function]] ''f'' : ''S'' → '''N''' from ''S'' to the [[natural numbers]] '''N''' = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.

It might seem natural to divide the sets into different classes: put all the sets containing one element together; all the sets containing two elements together; ...; finally, put together all infinite sets and consider them as having the same size.
This view is not tenable, however, under the natural definition of size.

To elaborate this we need the concept of a [[bijection]]. Although a "bijection" seems a more advanced concept than a number, the usual development of mathematics in terms of set theory defines functions before numbers, as they are based on much simpler sets. This is where the concept of a bijection comes in: define the correspondence

:''a'' ↔ 1, ''b'' ↔ 2, ''c'' ↔ 3

Since every element of {''a'', ''b'', ''c''} is paired with ''precisely one'' element of {1, 2, 3}, ''and'' vice versa, this defines a bijection.

We now generalize this situation and ''define'' two sets as of the same size if (and only if) there is a bijection between them. For all finite sets this gives us the usual definition of "the same size". What does it tell us about the size of infinite sets?

Consider the sets ''A'' = {1, 2, 3, ... }, the set of positive [[integer]]s and ''B'' = {2, 4, 6, ... }, the set of even positive integers. We claim that, under our definition, these sets have the same size, and that therefore ''B'' is countably infinite. Recall that to prove this we need to exhibit a bijection between them. But this is easy, using ''n'' ↔ 2''n'', so that
:1 ↔ 2, 2 ↔ 4, 3 ↔ 6, 4 ↔ 8, ....

As in the earlier example, every element of A has been paired off with precisely one element of B, and vice versa. Hence they have the same size. This is an example of a set of the same size as one of its proper subsets, which is impossible for finite sets.

Likewise, the set of all [[ordered pair]]s of natural numbers is countably infinite, as can be seen by following a path like the one in the picture: [[File:Pairing natural.svg|thumb|300px|The [[Cantor pairing function]] assigns one natural number to each pair of natural numbers]] The resulting mapping is like this:
:0 ↔ (0,0), 1 ↔ (1,0), 2 ↔ (0,1), 3 ↔ (2,0), 4 ↔ (1,1), 5 ↔ (0,2), 6 ↔ (3,0) ....
This mapping covers all such ordered pairs.

If you treat each pair as being the [[numerator]] and [[denominator]] of a [[vulgar fraction]], then for every positive fraction, we can come up with a distinct number corresponding to it. This representation includes also the natural numbers, since every natural number is also a fraction ''N''/1. So we can conclude that there are exactly as many positive rational numbers as there are positive integers. This is true also for all rational numbers, as can be seen below.

'''Theorem:''' The [[Cartesian product]] of finitely many countable sets is countable.

This form of triangular [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] [[recursion|recursively]] generalizes to [[vector space|vectors]] of finitely many natural numbers by repeatedly mapping the first two elements to a natural number. For example, (0,2,3) maps to (5,3), which maps to 39.

Sometimes more than one mapping is useful. This is where you map the set you want to show is countably infinite onto another set—and then map this other set to the natural numbers. For example, the positive [[rational number]]s can easily be mapped to (a subset of) the pairs of natural numbers because ''p''/''q ''maps to (''p'', ''q'').

What about infinite subsets of countably infinite sets? Do these have fewer elements than '''N'''?

'''Theorem:''' Every subset of a countable set is countable. In particular, every infinite subset of a countably infinite set is countably infinite.

For example, the set of [[prime number]]s is countable, by mapping the ''n''-th prime number to ''n'':
*2 maps to 1
*3 maps to 2
*5 maps to 3
*7 maps to 4
*11 maps to 5
*13 maps to 6
*17 maps to 7
*19 maps to 8
*23 maps to 9
*...

What about sets being naturally "larger than" '''N'''? For instance, '''Z''' the set of all [[integer]]s or '''Q''', the set of all [[rational number]]s, which intuitively may seem much bigger than '''N'''. But looks can be deceiving, for we assert:

'''Theorem:''' '''Z''' (the set of all integers) and '''Q''' (the set of all rational numbers) are countable.

In a similar manner, the set of [[algebraic number]]s is countable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kamke|1950|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These facts follow easily from a result that many individuals find non-intuitive.

'''Theorem:''' Any finite [[union (set theory)|union]] of countable sets is countable. 
&lt;!--
'''Q''' can be defined as the set of all fractions ''a''/''b'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers and ''b'' &gt; 0. This can be mapped onto the subset of ordered triples of natural numbers (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') such that ''a'' ≥ 0, ''b'' &gt; 0, ''a'' and ''b'' are [[coprime]], and ''c'' ∈ {0, 1} such that ''c'' = 0 if ''a''/''b'' ≥ 0 and ''c'' = 1 otherwise.

*0 maps to (0,1,0)
*1 maps to (1,1,0)
*−1 maps to (1,1,1)
*1/2 maps to (1,2,0)
*−1/2 maps to (1,2,1)
*2 maps to (2,1,0)
*−2 maps to (2,1,1)
*1/3 maps to (1,3,0)
*−1/3 maps to (1,3,1)
*3 maps to (3,1,0)
*−3 maps to (3,1,1)
*1/4 maps to (1,4,0)
*−1/4 maps to (1,4,1)
*2/3 maps to (2,3,0)
*−2/3 maps to (2,3,1)
*3/2 maps to (3,2,0)
*−3/2 maps to (3,2,1)
*4 maps to (4,1,0)
*−4 maps to (4,1,1)
*...
--&gt;

With the foresight of knowing that there are uncountable sets, we can wonder whether or not this last result can be pushed any further. The answer is "yes" and "no", we can extend it, but we need to assume a new axiom to do so.

'''Theorem:''' (Assuming the [[axiom of countable choice]]) The union of countably many countable sets is countable.

For example, given countable sets '''a''', '''b''', '''c''', ...

[[File:Countablepath.svg|thumb|300px|Enumeration for countable number of countable sets]]
Using a variant of the triangular enumeration we saw above:

*''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 0
*''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 1
*''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 2
*''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 3
*''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 4
*''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 5
*''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 6
*''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 7
*''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 8
*''d''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 9
*''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 10
*...

Note that this only works if the sets '''a''', '''b''', '''c''', ... are [[disjoint sets|disjoint]]. If not, then the union is even smaller and is therefore also countable by a previous theorem.

Also note that we need the [[axiom of countable choice]] to index ''all'' the sets '''a''', '''b''', '''c''', ... simultaneously.

'''Theorem:''' The set of all finite-length [[sequence]]s of natural numbers is countable.

This set is the union of the length-1 sequences, the length-2 sequences, the length-3 sequences, each of which is a countable set (finite Cartesian product). So we are talking about a countable union of countable sets, which is countable by the previous theorem.

'''Theorem:''' The set of all finite [[subset]]s of the natural numbers is countable.

If you have a finite subset, you can order the elements into a finite sequence. There are only countably many finite sequences, so also there are only countably many finite subsets.

The following theorem gives equivalent formulations in terms of a bijective function or a [[surjective function]].  A proof of this result can be found in Lang's text.&lt;ref name="Lang"/&gt;

'''(Basic) Theorem:''' Let ''S'' be a set. The following statements are equivalent:
# ''S'' is countable, i.e. there exists an injective function ''f'' : ''S'' → '''N'''.
# Either ''S'' is empty or there exists a surjective function ''g'' : '''N''' → ''S''.  
# Either ''S'' is finite or there exists a [[bijection]] ''h'' : '''N''' → ''S''.

'''Corollary:''' Let ''S'' and ''T'' be sets.
# If the function ''f'' : ''S'' → ''T'' is injective and ''T'' is countable then ''S'' is countable.
# If the function ''g'' : ''S'' → ''T'' is surjective and ''S'' is countable then ''T'' is countable.

'''[[Cantor's theorem]]''' asserts that if ''A'' is a set and ''P''(''A'') is its [[power set]], i.e. the set of all subsets of ''A'', then there is no surjective function from ''A'' to ''P''(''A'').  A proof is given in the article [[Cantor's theorem]].   As an immediate consequence of this and the Basic Theorem above we have:

'''Proposition:''' The set ''P''('''N''') is not countable; i.e. it is [[uncountable]].

For an elaboration of this result see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]].

The set of [[real number]]s is uncountable (see [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]]), and so is the set of all infinite [[sequence]]s of natural numbers.
&lt;!-- WILL RE-INSERT AFTER REORGANIZATION OFSECTION
'''Proof:''' For (1) observe that if ''T'' is countable there is an injective function  ''h'' : ''T'' → '''N'''.  Then if ''f'' : ''S'' → ''T'' is injective the composition ''h'' &lt;small&gt; o &lt;/small&gt; ''f'' : ''S'' → '''N''' is injective, so ''S'' is countable.

For (2) observe that if ''S'' is countable there is a surjective function ''h'' : '''N''' → ''S''.  Then if ''g'' : ''S'' → ''T'' is surjective the composition ''g'' &lt;small&gt; o &lt;/small&gt; ''h'' : '''N''' → ''T'' is surjective, so ''T'' is countable.
--&gt;

==Some technical details==
The proofs of the statements in the above section rely upon the existence of functions with certain properties. This section presents functions commonly used in this role, but not the verifications that these functions have the required properties. The Basic Theorem and its Corollary are often used to simplify proofs. Observe that {{math|'''N'''}} in that theorem can be replaced with any countably infinite set.

'''Proposition:''' Any [[finite set]] is countable.

'''Proof:''' Let {{mvar|S}} be such a set. Two cases are to be considered: Either {{mvar|S}} is empty or it isn't. 1.) The empty set is even itself a subset of the natural numbers, so it is countable. 2.) If {{mvar|S}} is nonempty and finite, then by definition of finiteness there is a bijection between {{mvar|S}} and the set {1, 2, ..., {{mvar|n}}} for some positive natural number {{mvar|n}}. This function is an injection from {{mvar|S}} into {{math|'''N'''}}.

'''Proposition:''' Any subset of a countable set is countable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halmos|1960|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof:''' The restriction of an injective function to a subset of its [[domain of a function|domain]] is still injective.

'''Proposition:''' If {{mvar|S}} is a countable set then {{math|''S'' ∪ {''x''}}} is countable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Avelsgaard|1990|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof:''' If {{math|x ∈ S}} there is nothing to be shown. Otherwise let {{math|''f'': ''S'' → '''N'''}} be an injection. Define {{math|''g'': ''S'' ∪ {''x''} → '''N'''}} by {{math|1=''g''(''x'') = 0}} and 
{{math|1=''g''(''y'') = ''f''(''y'') + 1}} for all {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|S}}. This function {{mvar|g}} is an injection.

'''Proposition:''' If {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are countable sets then {{math|''A'' ∪ ''B''}} is countable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Avelsgaard|1990|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof:''' Let {{math|''f'': ''A'' → '''N'''}} and {{math|''g'': ''B'' → '''N'''}} be injections. Define a new injection {{math|''h'': ''A'' ∪ ''B'' → '''N'''}} by {{math|1=''h''(''x'') = 2''f''(''x'')}} if {{mvar|x}} is in {{mvar|A}} and {{math|1=''h''(''x'') = 2''g''(''x'') + 1}} if {{mvar|x}} is in {{mvar|B}} but not in {{mvar|A}}.

'''Proposition:'''  The [[Cartesian product]] of two countable sets {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} is countable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halmos|1960|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof:''' Observe that {{math|'''N''' × '''N'''}} is countable as a consequence of the definition because the function {{math|''f'' : '''N''' × '''N''' → '''N'''}} given by  {{math|1=''f''(''m'', ''n'') = 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is injective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Avelsgaard|1990|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It then follows from the Basic Theorem and the Corollary that the Cartesian product of any two countable sets is countable. This follows because if {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are countable there are surjections {{math|''f'' : '''N''' → ''A''}} and {{math|''g'' : '''N''' → ''B''}}. So
:{{math|''f'' × ''g'' : '''N''' × '''N''' → ''A'' × ''B''}}
is a surjection from the countable set {{math|'''N''' × '''N'''}} to the set {{math|''A'' × ''B''}} and the Corollary implies {{math|''A'' × ''B''}} is countable. This result generalizes to the Cartesian product of any finite collection of countable sets and the proof follows by [[mathematical induction|induction]] on the number of sets in the collection.

'''Proposition:''' The [[integers]] {{math|'''Z'''}} are countable and the [[rational numbers]] {{math|'''Q'''}} are countable.

'''Proof:''' The integers {{math|'''Z'''}} are countable because the function {{math|''f'' : '''Z''' → '''N'''}} given by {{math|1=''f''(''n'') = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} if {{mvar|n}} is non-negative and {{math|1=''f''(''n'') = 3&lt;sup&gt;− ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} if {{mvar|n}} is negative, is an injective function. The rational numbers {{math|'''Q'''}} are countable because the function {{math|''g'' : '''Z''' × '''N''' → '''Q'''}} given by {{math|1=''g''(''m'', ''n'') = ''m''/(''n'' + 1)}} is a surjection from the countable set {{math|'''Z''' × '''N'''}} to the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}}.

'''Proposition:''' The [[algebraic number]]s {{math|'''A'''}} are countable.

'''Proof:''' Per definition, every algebraic number (including complex numbers) is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Given an algebraic number &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;a_0x^0+a_1x^1+a_2x^2+ \cdots + a_nx^n&lt;/math&gt; be a polynomial with integer coefficients such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k''th root of the polynomial, where the roots are sorted by absolute value from small to big, then sorted by argument from small to big. We can define an injection (i. e. one-to-one) function {{math|''f'' : '''A''' → '''Q'''}} given by &lt;math&gt;f(\alpha) = 2^{k-1} \cdot 3^{a_0} \cdot 5^{a_1} \cdot 7^{a_2} \cdots {p_{n+2}}^{a_n}&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; is the ''n''-th [[prime number|prime]].

'''Proposition:''' If {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is a countable set for each {{mvar|n}} in {{math|'''N'''}} then the union of all {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is also countable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|Patty|1988|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof:''' This is a consequence of the fact that for each {{mvar|n}} there is a surjective function {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' : '''N''' → ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and hence the function
:&lt;math&gt;G : \mathbf{N} \times \mathbf{N} \to \bigcup_{n \in \mathbf{N}} A_n,&lt;/math&gt;

given by {{math|1=''G''(''n'', ''m'') = ''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''m'')}} is a surjection.  Since {{math|'''N''' × '''N'''}} is countable, the Corollary implies that the union is countable. We use the [[axiom of countable choice]] in this proof to pick for each {{mvar|n}} in {{math|'''N'''}} a surjection {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} from the non-empty collection of surjections from {{math|'''N'''}} to {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

A topological proof for the uncountability of the real numbers is described at [[finite intersection property]].

==Minimal model of set theory is countable==
If there is a set that is a standard model (see [[inner model]]) of ZFC set theory, then there is a minimal standard model (''see'' [[Constructible universe]]). The [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] can be used to show that this minimal model is countable. The fact that the notion of "uncountability" makes sense even in this model, and in particular that this model ''M'' contains elements that are:
* subsets of ''M'', hence countable,
* but uncountable from the point of view of ''M'',
was seen as paradoxical in the early days of set theory, see [[Skolem's paradox]].

The minimal standard model includes all the [[algebraic number]]s and all effectively computable [[transcendental number]]s, as well as many other kinds of numbers.

==Total orders==
Countable sets can be [[total order|totally ordered]] in various ways, e.g.:
*[[Well-order]]s (see also [[ordinal number]]):
**The usual order of natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...)
**The integers in the order (0, 1, 2, 3, ...; −1, −2, −3, ...)
*Other (''not'' well orders):
**The usual order of integers (..., −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
**The usual order of rational numbers (Cannot be explicitly written as an ordered list!)

Note that in both examples of well orders here, any subset has a ''least element''; and in both examples of non-well orders, ''some'' subsets do not have a ''least element''.
This is the key definition that determines whether a total order is also a well order.

'''Critical terrorism studies''' ('''CTS''') applies a [[critical theory]] approach rooted in [[counter-hegemonic]] and politically progressive critical theory to the study of [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21"&gt;Jackson, R., Jarvis, L., Gunning, J., &amp; Breen-Smyth, M. (2011). Terrorism: A critical introduction. London, UK: Palgrave Macmillian&lt;/ref&gt; With links to the [[Frankfurt School]] of critical theory and the [[Aberystwyth School]] of critical security studies, CTS seeks to understand terrorism as a [[social construction]], or a label, that is applied to certain violent acts through a range of political, legal and academic processes.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; It also seeks to understand and critique dominant forms of counter-terrorism.

== Description ==

Following the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]]; there has been a massive increase in research related to terrorism. Terrorism has become one of the most powerful signifiers in contemporary society with the term generating vast amounts of social and political activity.  It has also become a cultural taboo which invokes emotions – fear and hatred.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35"&gt;Smyth, M.B., Gunning, J., Jackson, R. Kassimeris, G. &amp; Robinson, P. (2008). "Critical terrorism studies – an introduction". ''Critical Studies on Terrorism'', 1(1), 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS takes issue with previous terrorism studies in what it perceives as having methodological and analytical weaknesses, including a reliance on poor research methods and procedures, an overreliance on secondary resources, and a failure to undertake primary research; a failure to come up with an accepted definition of terrorism, and an inability to be cross-disciplinary. According to Jeroen Gunning: "core epistemological, methodological and political-normative problems persist, ranging from lack of conceptual clarity and theoretical sterility to political bias and a continuing dearth of primary research data".&lt;ref name="Gunning. A Case for 12"&gt;Gunning, J. (2007a). A case for critical terrorism studies? Government and opposition, 42(3), pp. 363-393.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS is a response to these research problems. With its origins in the Frankfurt School of critical theory, and the Welsh School of critical security studies (in which the primary referent to be secured is individuals not states), CTS is a self-reflective, critical approach to the study of terrorism which challenges the ontological, epistemological and ideological commitments of mainstream terrorism scholars.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; CTS also looks to attract academics from other disciplines who are uncomfortable with the mainstream discourse around terrorism and looks to engage directly with those who are perceived as 'terrorists' and/or terrorist sympathisers.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;

CTS aims to approach terrorism studies from a critical angle, that is, to encourage and further the adoption of a more self-consciously critical approach to the study of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. Research Agenda 20"&gt;Jackson, R., Breen Smyth, M., &amp; Gunning, J. (Eds.).(2009). Critical terrorism studies: A new research agenda. Abingdon, UK: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; However CTS does not only criticise the state of terrorism studies, it also attempts to "suggest an alternative way of studying terrorism and a concrete research agenda for the future".&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; While critical approaches to the study of terrorism are not new,&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. Research Agenda 20"/&gt; previous efforts have often occurred outside of the terrorism studies field. Such as the critical approach that some anthropology scholars have taken. These alternative approaches have "had little cross-fertilization with the orthodox field and have largely failed to alter its practices, priorities, approaches, outputs and myths".&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; CTS seeks to engage directly with the orthodox field,&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; and question its normative assumptions. Prompted by the growing unease over the state of current terrorism research, and the relationship between much orthodox terrorism research and the institutions of state power, CTS sets out to "stimulate, encourage, and more clearly articulate the nascent but observable 'critical turn' that was starting to become visible within the broader terrorism studies field".&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. Research Agenda 20"/&gt;

CTS scholars argue that terrorism should be de-exceptionalised as a form of political violence, not singled out as a unique form of "evil" violence, but  should be treated as other forms of political violence are.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; CTS also encourages researchers to engage with terrorists as humans, and not form explanations of terrorists in an [[Other (philosophy)|'Othering']] sense.&lt;ref name="Gunning. A Case for 12"/&gt; Therefore; "Ultimately, a critical approach to terrorism suggests that more positive and progressive change is always possible and that we can break out of seemingly endless cycles of terrorist/counter-terrorist violence, if only we can begin to think, study, speak and act outside of the dominant terrorism paradigm."&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;

== History ==

CTS's antecedents lie with scholars such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Edward S. Herman|Edward Herman]], who published critical works relating to the state and terrorism from the late 1970s. One of the first major works that gave impetus to a CTS discourse was [[Joseba Zulaika]] and William Douglass's&lt;ref name=" Zulaika 43 "&gt;Zulaika, J., (2012). "Drones, Witches and other Flying Objects: the Force of Fantasy in US Counterterrorism". ''Critical Studies on Terrorism'', 5(1), 51-68&lt;/ref&gt; seminal work, ''Terror and Taboo: The Follies, Fables, and Faces of Terrorism''. This book was a critical appraisal of  many of the international community's commonly-held assumptions about terrorism. A further catalyst for CTS came from Richard Jackson's 2005 book, ''Writing the War on Terrorism''. Jackson called for scholars to resist the current terrorism studies discourse: "I believe we have an ethical duty to resist the discourse, to deconstruct it at every opportunity and continually to interrogate the exercise of power".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. (2005) Writing the War on Terror: Language, politics and counter-terrorism. Manchester University Press, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; The setting up of the Critical Studies on Terrorism Working Group (CSTWG) within the [[British International Studies Association]] (BISA) occurred in early 2006, while in October 2006, a conference was held entitled; 'Is it time for a critical terrorism studies?' This was followed by two journal articles that called for a critical appraisal of the current state of terrorism studies. Richard Jackson's "Introduction: The Case for Critical Terrorism Studies" and Jeroen Gunning's "A case for Critical Terrorism Studies". In his "A case for Critical Terrorism Studies", Gunning calls for a critical approach that will "encourage researchers to historicize and contextualize the conflict by looking at the evolution of violence, broader processes of [[radicalization]], the relationship between violent organizations and wider social movements, and the relationship between social movements and the state."&lt;ref name="Gunning. A Case for 12" /&gt;

The setting up of the journal ''Critical Studies in Terrorism'' occurred in early 2007. The idea behind launching the journal was "one small part of a much broader attempt to foster a more self-reflective, critical approach to the study of terrorism, and bring in those who study aspects of 'terrorism', but are uncomfortable with or hostile to the (perceived) [[Ontology|ontological]], [[Epistemology|epistemological]], and [[Ideology|ideological]] commitments of existing terrorism studies."&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; CTS has continued to expand as a sub-discipline of terrorism studies and there has been a growth of CTS programs in universities such as [[Aberystwyth University]], the [[University of Kent]] and the [[University of Manchester]]. Other courses also exist within peace studies and politics programmes in universities such as [[Otago University]], [[Durham University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Virginia Tech]], [[University of Florida]], and [[Queens University Belfast]]. A major milestone in CTS will be the ''Handbook of Critical Terrorism Studies'' due to be published by [[Routledge]] in 2015.

== Ontological and epistemological foundations ==

===Two ontological critical theories===
* Critical realism: Observer and observed, or subject and object, are distinctly separate (For a clear alternative discussion on critical realism and CTS, see: Stump and Dixit 2013, 2011). 
* [[Reflectivism]]: Observer and observed or subject and object are deeply interconnected (For a more reflective discourse see: Jackson, Javis, Gunning, Smyth 2009&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;).
There has been a huge amount of academic discussion about the [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] foundations of critical terrorism studies. Within CTS, there is a broad agreement on the need to examine terrorism and terrorists from a historical, contextualized perspective asking 'how' questions of causation and constitution, rather than the more orthodox problem solving questions of a single isolated event. For instance, CTS questions why a terrorist action happens, asking whether the terrorists simply hate western notions of freedom, or whether they have deeper underlying political motivations?  CTS adopts the ontological position that "terrorism" is fundamentally a social fact rather than brute fact.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;

===Epistemological perspective===
* Critical realism: best approximation to objective world.
* [[Reflexivism]]: tool for inducing self-reflection of individuals and groups. Not static and monolithic.
CTS adopts the epistemological position that the nature of knowledge in terrorism studies is a social process which relies on contextual factors, including the influence of the researcher. CTS scholars argue that by being continuously aware of context, social processes, and the 'known' and 'unknown' knowledge in circulation, you can gain further insights into the study of terrorism. CTS also acknowledges the link between power and knowledge, and who research is ultimately for.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;

===Overview of research areas===
* With the focus on epistemological understanding, it is now possible to question how we receive knowledge and who it benefits and why. 
* Examining the constructed information flow produced through academic research, basic education, political rhetoric, state and international law, and media. Reframing the discourse through a reflexive epistemology. 
* Human security over state security/national security. Move away from state-centric policies on security, to focusing on people and liberty.
* [[Emancipation]]: whose voice is marginalized or silenced, whose voice is empowered in defining terrorism, and what should the response to it be in particular contexts?&lt;ref name="McDonald 25"&gt;McDonald, M., 2007. Emancipation and critical terrorism studies. European Political Science, 6 (3), 252–259.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gender: the misconception that typically women are seen as victims of political violence and men as perpetrators.
* Gendering serves to maintain gender hierarchy and reinforces essentialist stereotypes of women as peaceful and powerless.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; Reframing women's interaction with terrorism and violence.
* Study of political terror (violence), state terrorism, structural violence and cultural violence.
* Exploring the extent to which the status quo contributes to the problem of terrorism.    "Whom defines terrorism?  Whom defines terrorist? Whom defines the dominant response?".&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; 
* [[State terrorism]] and [[counter-terrorism]]: creating the conditions of oppositional violence. To analyse the way traditional terrorism discourse is used to discredit oppositional groups and justify state policies. The applying of historical materialist approaches to systematic research of state terrorism has started to be critically assessed by [[Michael Stohl]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Richard Jackson (sociologist)|Richard Jackson]], [[Ruth Blakeley]] and others.

== Major differences from orthodox terrorism studies ==

CTS differs from [[:wikt:orthodox|orthodox]]/traditional terrorism studies (OTS) in several fundamental ways. Some of the most significant points of difference include its emphasis on the utilization of [[critical theory]] in research, its focus on removing the bias of [[ethnocentrism]] from all research, its goal to facilitate the spread of [[emancipation]] of peoples previously marginalized in traditional terrorism studies, and its attempt to avoid political bias and a problem-solving policy-orientation.

===Utilization of critical theory===
Scholars created CTS in response to what they felt was missing from traditional terrorism studies, namely, the critical aspect of research.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; Employing critical thinking in terrorism research can mean employing any one of several existing critical theories (such as [[Derrida]]'s [[deconstruction]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s [[post-structuralism]], or [[Louis Althusser|Althusser]]'s [[structuralism]], etc.) But, in a broader sense, it simply means researching and writing to challenge commonly held social, political, and personal beliefs about terrorism that often go unchallenged (specifically in traditional terrorism studies).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R., 2007a. "Symposium: Introduction: the case for critical terrorism studies". ''European Political Science'', 6 (3), 225–227.&lt;/ref&gt; OTS scholars agree that critical thinking and the utilization of critical theory should be a prominent aspect of any valuable research.&lt;ref&gt;Ranstorp, M., ed., 2006. ''Mapping terrorism research: state of the art, gaps and future directions''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rengger, N. and Thirkell-White, B., 2007. "Still critical after all these years? The past, present and future of critical theory in international relations". ''Review of International Studies'', 33, 3–24.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they also feel that such research already exists within the field of terrorism studies and that CTS is bringing more of a critical eye to the field, but that there is no cause for it to be a whole separate sub-field.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; However, unlike traditional terrorism studies, CTS is strict on its adherence to the critical element of research, as it believes critical analysis is one of the few ways to overcome the problematic gaps within traditional terrorism studies.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17"&gt;Jackson, R., 2007b. The core commitments of critical terrorism studies. European Political Science, 6 (3), 244–251.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS also hopes that the critical element will also eventually bridge the traditional and critical approaches, if both begin to follow the research procedures that allow critical analysis.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt;

===Removing ethnocentrism===
CTS attempts to combat what they feel is a prevalent state-centricity and [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentricity]] in traditional terrorism studies.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, J., 2006. Overblown: how politicians and the terrorism industry inflate national security threats and why we believe them. New York, NY: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent scholars Jackson, Gunning and Smyth claim that since most research on terrorism is done by [[state-sponsored]] scholars and experts, there is a disproportionate amount of research articulating states' perspectives and experiences (namely western state-actors), leaving almost all non-state actors without any fair, unbiased representation in the research field.&lt;ref name="Silke 33"&gt;Silke, A., ed., 2004. Research on terrorism: trends, achievements and failures. London: Frank Cass.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, CTS challenges state-centric or ethnocentric research by responding directly to already published research, finding holes and gaps in the arguments,&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; and by completing new research that challenges ethnocentric claims and provides new claims from the perspective of non-state entities, and specifically, the perspectives of the so-labeled 'terrorists' themselves.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; OTS scholars see this shift from so-called "[[state centrism]]" as obvious and not wholly necessary. Bias is unavoidable and viewing it as such has the possibility to weaken arguments already made.&lt;ref name="Silke 33" /&gt; Also, there is not a complete lack of ethnocentric-free research within terrorism studies and therefore CTS is seen as simply creating a bifurcation between the subfields.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Silke 33" /&gt; Despite this criticism, CTS remains determined to conduct research free from state-centric and ethnocentric perspectives, opening space for new perspectives and discourses that may have been overlooked by terrorism studies as a whole.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt;

===Facilitating the spread of emancipation===
When referring to the [[emancipation|emancipatory]] nature of research, CTS is referring not only to the emancipation of previously marginalized peoples' voices in the field of OTS, but the emancipation of ideas, questions and theories that have been marginalized, overlooked, or seen as non-issues in orthodox studies. A simple way to understand CTS's emancipation is to think of it as a process of creating space and discussion that allows the focus to be on experiences, ideas and questions which have been "neglected in most orthodox accounts of security and terrorism".&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; The emancipation of ideas, dialogue, and experience is a powerful "philosophical anchorage"&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; that allows CTS to separate itself and its motives from that of traditional and orthodox terrorism studies. Traditional terrorism studies theorists understand the value behind the idea of emancipatory nature of CTS's research, but many feel such a claim is overstated.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15"&gt;Horgan, J. &amp; Boyle, M. J., (2008). A case against 'Critical Terrorism Studies', Critical Studies on Terrorism, 1:1, 51-64, DOI: 10.1080/17539150701848225.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS's claim of emancipation is seen as simply reinventing the wheel, a wheel that has been working effectively for orthodox scholars for decades. And the claim&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; to be the first in a field as politically charged and somewhat emotionally delicate as terrorism studies to ask hard questions and challenge commonly held beliefs and assumptions is seen as a gross over-simplification and generalization that risks replacing one dominant discourse with another, and in turn,  marginalizing the research and voices of traditional terrorism studies.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, J., 2007. The rise and rise of terrorism studies. The Guardian, 3 July.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite traditional terrorism studies' negative response to CTS's emancipatory claim, CTS still strives to keep emancipation as one of its core motivations for continued research.&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; Emancipatory research in terrorism studies can bring to light overlooked perspectives such as the war in Iraq being a form of occupation bringing more violence than peace,&lt;ref&gt;Fontan, V., 2006. Polarization between occupier and occupied in post-Saddam Iraq: humiliation and the formation of political violence. Terrorism and Political Violence, 18, 217–238.&lt;/ref&gt; the idea that State sponsored research is often biased and unreliable&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; and that any and all valuable research should be conducted free of political bias to truly increase understanding.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt; These few listed ideas are examples of what CTS hopes to bring to the field of terrorism studies through emancipatory research.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;

===Freedom from policy===
One of the largest voids of orthodox terrorism studies CTS aims to fill is the void of politically neutral and policy-free research and ideas.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; Post-9/11, almost all research on terrorism has been sponsored and conducted by [[state-actors]], many standing to gain politically from the conclusions drawn from such research.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnett 5"&gt;Burnett, J. &amp; Whyte, D. (2005). Embedded expertise and the new terrorism. Journal for Crime, Conflict and the Media, 1(4), 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS feels that the prominent discourse maintained by State-sponsored terrorism research contributes to the justification of [[state terrorism]] and de-legitimizes any argument that would challenge or condemn such actions.&lt;ref name="Sluka 34"&gt;Sluka, J., 2000. "Introduction: State terror and anthropology" in J. Sluka, ed. ''Death squad: The anthropology of state terror''. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when research is sponsored for political reasons, the 'experts' become not those who have the most relevant experience, but those who are willing to support whatever political view that will result in more funding, and those who are willing to adhere to any current policy around terrorism (e.g. "Our country does not negotiate with terrorists" therefore all research reflects the impossibility of negotiating with terrorist).&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, C., 2006. In the name of terrorism: presidents on political violence in the post-World War II era. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox terrorism studies researchers see the idea of political and policy neutral research as a nice sentiment, but impossible to execute.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt; Many have criticized CTS for claiming policy free and politically neutral research, as even the word terrorism itself is not free of any political meaning and connotation.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt; And since many scholars study and research the causes, effects, and nature of terrorism because of passionate ideas and interests, it would be irresponsible to assert that simply because a piece of research is free of state centricism and bias that it is automatically politically neutral.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; Again, traditional terrorism studies sees CTS's research attempts as oversimplifications to claim innovation in an already established field.

However, CTS sees the criticism from orthodox scholars as extenuating the need for there to be more than one avenue of academic discourse available.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; By aiming to keep all research politically neutral and policy free, a space opens up for experts with non-state experience to enter a field which was previously unavailable to them.&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; And again, politically neutral scholars are more able to bring to attention and help fight acts of state terrorism that are often overlooked and even justified in orthodox studies.&lt;ref name="Sluka 34" /&gt;

===Traditional terrorism studies' response===
CTS's new approach and perspective has been widely welcomed in the field of terrorism studies. Nevertheless, it has  been subject to criticism for its desire to distinguish itself from what it deems "traditional" or "orthodox" terrorism studies, and for its claim of maintaining absolute political neutrality. However, scholars both from critical and traditional terrorism studies remain determined not to allow any distinction between the subfields to cause bifurcation and incompatibility within the field of research itself.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt;

== CTS's main critiques of traditional terrorism studies ==

CTS would not have come into existence unless scholars saw the need for a change in many of the perspectives within terrorism studies as a whole.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; Some of the most common criticisms CTS consistently presents including the inconsistent 'definition' of terrorism, the political power held by most Orthodox scholars, the ineffectiveness of the War on Terror, the glorification of patriotism, and the demonising narrative of the 'enemy'.

===Definitions of terrorism===
The term "terrorism" gained prominence during the [[French Revolution]] when it was used by the Jacobins to kill known supporters of the [[Ancien Régime]], and to eliminate those labeled enemies of the revolution.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40"&gt;Wilkinson, P. (2012). "The Utility of the Concept of Terrorism" in R. Jackson and S. J. Sinclair (eds.), ''Contemporary Debates on Terrorism'', Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the state was the first proponent of using terrorism as a political tool.&lt;ref&gt;Stohl, M. (2008). Old myths, new fantasies and the enduring realities of terrorism, Critical Studies on Terrorism, 1:1, 5-16, DOI: 10.1080/17539150701846443.&lt;/ref&gt; Moving into the twentieth century, the regimes of [[Nazi Germany]] and Soviet Russia, through the use of secret police, used tension to subdue and kill those deemed enemies of the state. Further, a number of Latin American states backed by the US utilised state-terrorism to silence the population and consolidate their control – Chile and Nicaragua in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Pilger, J. (1994). ''Distant Voices'' (rev. ed.). London: Vintage.&lt;/ref&gt;  Up until this point, terrorism was largely, though not exclusively, defined by its use by state. And it was not until later that academic circles shifted the focus to non-state actors.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt; There is research to suggest that states that have witnessed severe upheaval throughout their history will utilise state-terrorism. Such as Iraq, Syria, Israel, Burundi, Rwanda, Zaire, Myanmar, Indonesia, Serbia and Chechnya.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt; Furthermore, for weak states, state terrorism is often viewed as a legitimate total state consolidation.

Terrorism therefore has a number of meanings and interpretations that we can use to assess terrorist acts in the contemporary era. Terrorism is a heavily contested concept and it is the context in which a violent act occurs as to how people define the act. It is symbolic violence, a communicative act, with the sole purpose to send the message. It is the psychological effect of using fear, as it is not the victims of a terrorist act. But the wider audience who are the target, because the victims become instrumental as they are the message carriers.

* Generic terrorism: "The systematic use of violence and intimidation to coerce a government or community, into acceding to specific political demands."&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, J., and Trumble, B., eds, (2006). Oxford Referencing Dictionary, 2nd ed., revised, Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the use of or the threat of violence that is meant to intimidate a wider target than the immediate victims of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt;
* Non-state terrorism: Involves attacks on civilians, symbolic and random targets and is usually, though not exclusively, aimed at bringing about political change.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt;
* [[Religious terrorism]]: Political violence in the name of religion by religiously motivated people. A problematic term that is used to categorise terrorism and differentiate it from other forms of terrorism, by assuming there is a casual relationship between religion and violence, rather than looking at the study of beliefs and practices in the production of political violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gunning, J., and Jackson, R. (2011). "What's so 'religious' about 'religious terrorism'?", ''Critical Studies on Terrorism'', 4:3, 369-388, DOI: 10.1080/17539153.2011.623405.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[State terrorism]]: Involves the intimidation of the civilian population into submission. This occurs when a third-party is used to silence dissidents, and kill people, instilling fear in the population.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt;

===Links to power===
A CTS critique of OTS revolves around many OTS scholars' links to institutions of power. CTS questions these links to [[hegemonic]] actors and structures from the [[global North]] that can be seen to be furthering the agendas of certain states, because OTS is a discipline that is primarily concerned with looking at acts of terrorism by non-state actors. This is a very state-centric perspective which has a limited set of assumptions and narratives about the nature and cause of terrorism. Moreover, this becomes accepted as the general consensus at the macro, meso and micro levels of government and institutions, and is reflected in policy and the way the mainstream view terrorism. Traditional terrorism studies is also largely concerned with "problem solving theory", which looks at the world "with the prevailing social and power relationships and the institutions into which they are organised, as the given framework for action", and then works to "make these relationships and institutions work smoothly by dealing effectively with particular sources of trouble".&lt;ref&gt;Cox, R. (1981). Social forces, states and world orders: Beyond international relations theory. Millennium: Journal of International Studies, 10(2), 126-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they look at dealing with the issue of terrorism within the current dominant structures of power. An example of this is the scholars and associated research that is affiliated with the [[RAND Corporation]]. Now an independent think tank, RAND was established by the US air force in 1945, and was contracted to the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. It has maintained close links with US administrations, and former board members include [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and [[Condoleezza Rice]], both leading members of the [[George W. Bush]] administration.&lt;ref name="Blakeley 4"&gt;Blakeley, R. (2009). ''State Terrorism and Neoliberalism: The north in the south''. London, UK: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The major problem with this association with government is that it privileges research on threats by non-state actors, and marginalises research around state sponsorship of terrorism. According to Burnett and Whyte, the Corporation acts "effectively as an influential prestigious voice in the American military-industrial lobby and in world politics; particularly with regard to its interventions on the war on terror". Scholars, or "embedded experts"&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; associated with RAND have key editorial positions in the two most prominent English-language terrorism journals, ''Terrorism and Political Violence'' and ''Conflict and Terrorism''. RAND scholars helped to found the [[St Andrew Centre for Studies in Terrorism and Political Violence (CSTPV)]], the leading centre for the study of terrorism in the UK.&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; As well, experts associated with the RAND-St Andrews nexus have significant professional ties with businesses and military personal associated with counter-terrorism activity, many of which have made "windfall profits" in the Iraq conflict.&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt;

== The War on Terror ==

On [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks | 19 terrorists]]&lt;ref name="Pape 27"&gt;Pape. R. (2005) ''Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism''. New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– in association with [[Al-Qaeda]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks|hijacked four commercial planes and flew them]] into the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)| World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], [[The Pentagon]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], and a field near [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania]]. The number of deaths is estimated at 2996 casualties.&lt;ref name="http 49"&gt;http://owni.eu/2011/05/05/the-war-on-terror-in-numbers/&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days, President [[George W. Bush]] declared a [[War on Terror]] to prevent any more terrorist attacks on the Western world. Bush immediately framed these terrorists as being motivated by [[Islamic extremism]]; an evil, destructive and repressive people who America refused to negotiate with and must defeat (45). The estimates of how many thousands of civilians, insurgents, soldiers (both American and otherwise) and Islamists that have been killed in the war on terror vary widely from 220,000&lt;ref name="http 49" /&gt; to 650,000.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; However these statistics are unreliable due to their varied date, source and amount – it is not possible to know how many people have been victims of the war on terror. Not only has this war killed, tortured and displaced hundreds of thousands of people, there is no proof that it has been effective in reducing terrorism, and has led to a further proliferation of terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name="Lum 24"&gt;Lum, C., Kennedy, L. W., &amp; Sherley, A. (2006).  Are counter-terrorism strategies effective?&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationality behind Bush's decision to start a war on terrorism comes in four parts. First it was implemented as a preventive war, and as an excuse to act pre-emptively. Second, it was based on unilateralism, although where necessary, Bush attempted to enlist support from the international community. Third, there was an element of idealism that believed that war would help to spread democracy, human rights and liberties. And lastly, Bush endeavoured to maintain American hegemony by reaffirming the vital role of American military strength.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; It is argued that the negative effects of this war will be felt for generations, due to the culture of division, stereotyping and hate between the Middle East and the West. The formation of a new "suspect community" in the Middle East has undermined human rights and civil liberties, and impaired the functionality of the international system.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; [[Just war theory]] stands as the main justification for the war on terror. This means that new technologies and methods in war are legalized. The [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] is viewed by many CTS scholars as an act of terror.&lt;ref name="Keen 23"&gt;Keen, D. (2006). War without end? Magic, Propaganda and the hidden functions of counter-terror. Journal of International Development, 18(1), p. 87-104&lt;/ref&gt; Terror on terror makes no sense,&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; and did not produce positive results. The attack on Iraq  was illogical considering America's past partnership with Iraq, the whereabouts of [[Al-Qaeda]]'s base and [[Osama bin Laden]] in Afghanistan, and also the men who attacked the twin towers were from Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="Pape 27" /&gt;  American power internationally meant that they authorized the attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan, and also drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. While Bush legitimises the enemy by asserting that terrorists want to 'kill all Americans',&lt;ref name="https 45"&gt;ConspiracyWorld (September 3, 2010). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CSPbzitPL8 "Sept. 20, 2001 - Bush Declares War on Terror"]. ''[[YouTube]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no discernable difference between this falsified aim and the goal of American Military intervention in the Middle East. [[Barack Obama]] has continued the Bush-instigated War on Terror by plainly stating that the biggest threat to America is still terrorism.&lt;ref name="http 48"&gt;http://america.aljazeera.com/blogs/scrutineer/2014/5/29/obama-west-pointspeech.html&lt;/ref&gt;  So, despite the reduction of military occupation in the Middle East, the trace of War on Terror still remains.&lt;ref name="http 48" /&gt;

===Counter-insurgency failures===
The overall ineffective and illegitimate result of the war on terror means that the costs have thus far outweighed the successes. [[Counter-terrorism]] efforts such as [[Targeted killing]] and [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drone strikes]] have backfired and are not proven to work, and have even perpetuated the number of terrorist attacks, including [[Suicide attacks|suicide bombings]].&lt;ref name="Lum 24" /&gt; While counter-terrorism may deter some attacks, it cannot prevent all, and often has the result of provoking rather than reducing terrorism. The [[Iraq War]] was not productive in countering terrorism.&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; Upward of 60 examples of terrorist incidents in America are proven consequences of United States foreign policy and military intervention.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/fpb50.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Still, no academic scholar in orthodox terrorism studies has considered American military intervention as the primary problem.&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; It is noted that at [[Faisal Shahzad]]'s trial – following his failed [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]] – he cited the drones that were killing the people of his community as the reason for his vengeance.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Unmanned drone attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan tend to target public places and gatherings, such as weddings and funerals, and are increasing the threat of terrorism. Violence emanates and results from counterinsurgency/terrorism. What America calls preventative war, the Middle East calls state terrorism.&lt;ref name="Aretxaga 1"&gt;Aretxaga, B. (2001). "Terror as a thrill: First thoughts on the 'war on terrorism'." ''Anthropological Quarterly'', 75(1), p.138–150&lt;/ref&gt;

===The War on Terror and patriotism===
Throughout American history, military strength has been at the heart of identity; it is embedded in politics and culture. War as a solution is rooted in American culture, as [[The War of Independence]] and [[World War Two|World War II]] are referred to as successes and justifications for future war.&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; Rather than concentrating resources and money on problems that have widespread negative effects on American society, like poverty, education, health or the environment, the United States has spent US$1.283 trillion since 9/11 on military interventions internationally.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/rl33110.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotype of the enemy is perpetuated and normalized through American culture, media, entertainment and politics. And the shared hate for the enemy contributes to a unified patriotism within America that deflects attention from the deeply entrenched inequalities within the nation.&lt;ref name="Aretxaga 1" /&gt; The war on terror acts as a distraction mechanism from local problems in the Western world, and maintains a war culture of its own that produces justifications and legitimate rationality for prolonging the war in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Bayoumi, M. (2008). Endless War? Hidden Functions of the 'War on Terror' by David Keen. Development and Change. 39(5), p.870-871.&lt;/ref&gt; The patriotism that the war on terror creates contributes to large sources of revenue for the American military industrial economy through [[mass surveillance]], weapon suppliers, the [[CIA]], military personnel and orthodox terrorism academics.&lt;ref&gt;Zalman, A., &amp; Clarke, J. (2009). The Global War on Terror: A Narrative in Need of a Rewrite. Ethics &amp; International Affairs, 23(2), p.101-113,89-90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating a narrative of the enemy===
The culture of war is created through the imagery and language used in politics and popular entertainment in order to frame a narrative of the enemy. [[Islam]] and [[Muslims]] have been constructed as a dangerous other in Western culture. Not only do politicians&amp;nbsp;– especially in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]&amp;nbsp;– inform the public of this enemy, this fictional reality is reinforced through journalism and entertainment in which the war is framed as inevitable and the enemy as evil.&lt;ref name="Aretxaga 1" /&gt; This all reinforces the fantasy that this war is about fighting evil in general, and the Western soldiers that are killed are fighting for a greater good. The hyperbolic, dramatic language used in the media casts the Western world as heroes who fight the villains. CTS reflects on who this narrative of the enemy benefits. This perception that reinforces patriotism and justifications for war, profits the Western world and furthers the dominance and oppression that divides the two regions.
When the motives and ideology of terrorists are largely unknown – let alone the number and whereabouts – the greater the possibility is to rely on stereotype and myth-based discourse.&lt;ref name="http 44"&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-brenner/terror-americas-archetype_b_5784166.html?ir=WorldPost&lt;/ref&gt; Because the enemy is foreign (even alien) this possibility is increased due to limited knowledge and physical connection to the region. When reality falls short, the narrative of foreign peoples is shaped by "shortcuts provided by stylized imagery compounded of stories, films and our own imaginations".&lt;ref name="http 44" /&gt; Politicians use this to back up their dehumanized claims, so the image of the terrorist mimics [[Osama bin Laden]] with the beard, turban, black eyes and hollow glum face creating a stereotyped stigma. This enemy is merciless, believes in extreme religious values and will do anything to destroy the West. Such imagery and language degrades common humanity, and prevents us from understanding that the enemy is a human who is victimized.

===Terrorism and mobilities===
[[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]] was a pioneer in discussing the paradigms of mobilities within the age of terror. Per his viewpoint, terrorism operates in a world of contrasting complexities where the power, far from being static, flows. The power is mobile in the same way, its gravity-effects on the world of consumption. Terrorism divides the world in two safe and unsafe zones.&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. (2002). The global complexities of September 11th. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, 19(4), 57-69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. (2005). The complexities of the global. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, 22(5), 235-254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. (2005). The complexity turn. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, 22(5), 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Over past decades, many voices alerted on the negative effects of terrorism over the industry of tourism and mobilities in developed and underdeveloped economies.&lt;ref&gt;Sönmez, S. F., Apostolopoulos, Y., &amp; Tarlow, P. (1999). Tourism in crisis: Managing the effects of terrorism. Journal of Travel Research, 38(1), 13-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergent theories explained terrorism as an indicator of the lack of democracy, or even extreme poverty which represents a fertile ground for ethnic resentment necessary to rechannel terrorism. Since tourists are ambassadors of first World, not surprisingly they were targets of terrorist cells in zones dotted with lower levels of security.&lt;ref&gt;Pizam, A., &amp; Smith, G. (2000). Tourism and terrorism: A quantitative analysis of major terrorist acts and their impact on tourism destinations. Tourism Economics, 6(2), 123-138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mansfeld, Y., &amp; Pizam, A.

Kyklos, 45(4), 531-554.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some other scholars questioned this idea considering that tourism recovers its attraction and growth after elapsed little time from the original event;&lt;ref&gt;Fleischer, A., &amp; Buccola, S.

{{technical|date=April 2017}}{{Psychology sidebar}}'''Dishabituation''' (or '''''dehabituation''''') is a form of recovered or restored behavioral response wherein the reaction towards a known stimulus is enhanced, as opposed to [[habituation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Genevieve Z.|last2=Barry|first2=Robert J.|date=2014-02-14|year=|title=The mechanism of dishabituation|journal=Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience|volume=8|pages=|doi=10.3389/fnint.2014.00014|issn=1662-5145|pmc=3924047|pmid=24592215|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it was proposed as an explanation to increased response for a habituated behavior by introducing an external stimulus;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~coulson/101b/Learning1.pdf|title=Classical Conditioning {{!}} Learning, Memory, &amp; Attention|last=|first=|date=|website=University of California, San Diego - Department of Cognitive Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, upon further analysis, the focus was conclusively established that a proper analysis of dishabituation should be taken into consideration only when the response is increased by implying the original stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rankin|first=Catharine H.|last2=Abrams|first2=Thomas|last3=Barry|first3=Robert J.|last4=Bhatnagar|first4=Seema|authorlink4=Seema Bhatnagar|last5=Clayton|first5=David|last6=Colombo|first6=John|last7=Coppola|first7=Gianluca|last8=Geyer|first8=Mark A.|last9=Glanzman|first9=David L.|date=2017-03-28|year=|title=Habituation Revisited: An Updated and Revised Description of the Behavioral Characteristics of Habituation|journal=Neurobiology of learning and memory|volume=92|issue=2|pages=135–138|doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2008.09.012|issn=1074-7427|pmc=2754195|pmid=18854219|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on studies conducted over habituation's dual-process theory which attributed towards dishabituation, it is also determined that the latter was independent of any behavioral sensitization.&lt;ref name="Steiner"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Genevieve Z.|last2=Barry|first2=Robert J.|date=2014-01-01|year=|title=The mechanism of dishabituation|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/sspapers/782/|journal=Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience|language=en|volume=8|pages=|doi=10.3389/fnint.2014.00014|pmc=3924047|pmid=24592215|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of dishabituation is the response of a receptionist in a scenario where a delivery truck arrives at 9:00AM every morning. The first few times it arrives it is noticed by the receptionist, and after weeks, the receptionist does not respond as strongly. One day the truck does not arrive, and the receptionist notices its absence. When it arrives the next day, the receptionist's response is stronger when it arrives as expected.

== History ==
The phenomenon was studied by an early scientist [[Samuel Jackson Holmes]] in 1912, while he was studying the [[Animal Behavior|animal behavior]] in [[sea urchin]]s. Later in 1933, [[George Humphrey (psychologist)|George Humphrey]]—while studying the same effects in human babies and extensively over [[lower vertebrates]]—argued that dishabituation is in fact the removal of habituation altogether, to a behavior that was not conditioned to begin with.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Richard F|date=2017-03-28|year=|title=Habituation: A History|journal=Neurobiology of learning and memory|volume=92|issue=2|pages=127–134|doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2008.07.011|issn=1074-7427|pmc=2714193|pmid=18703156|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism ==

=== In humans ===
According to the [[Habituation#Dual-process theory|dual-process theory of habituation]], dishabituation is characterized by an increase in responding to a habituated stimulus after introducing a deviant, to sensitize a change in arousal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=OT-rUMExGrAC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=dishabituation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O6Y1wG8G9G&amp;sig=H4PE0B48Ak4oQIIFJ9nqSXj0feg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3r_2e2PjSAhVIi7wKHSqmCHw4ChDoAQhGMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=dishabituation&amp;f=false|title=Learning: Principles and Applications|last=Klein|first=Stephen B.|date=2011-04-04|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781412987349|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner"/&gt; Further investigations into elicitation and habituation of the electrodermal orienting reflex also showed that dishabituation is independent of sensitization for indifferent stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Genevieve Z.|last2=Barry|first2=Robert J.|date=2011-01-01|title=Exploring the mechanism of dishabituation|url=http://researchdirect.uws.edu.au/islandora/object/uws:30621|journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory|language=en|volume=95|issue=4|pages=461–466|doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2011.02.007|issn=1074-7427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[meta-analysis]] shows that dishabituation is improvised on preterm infants as compared to term infants based on the magnitude of stimulus sensitized.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kavšek|first=Michael|last2=Bornstein|first2=Marc H.|date=2010-01-01|year=|title=Visual Habituation and Dishabituation in Preterm Infants: A Review and Meta-analysis|journal=Research in developmental disabilities|volume=31|issue=5|pages=951–975|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2010.04.016|issn=0891-4222|pmc=3167676|pmid=20488657|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mnstate.edu/malonech/Psy611/Notes/Bjorklund/Perception%20and%20Cognition%20BjCh4.htm|title=Infant Perception and Cognition|last=|first=|date=|website=Minnesota State University Moorhead|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Biological basis ====
As per the Center for [[Neural engineering|Neural Engineering]], [[University of Southern California]] ([[Los Angeles]]), the primordial [[hippocampus]] plays an important role in modeling the dishabituation of behavioral response. According to this, the interaction of two processes is dynamically postulated based on [[synaptic plasticity]], which acquires both long and short-term forgetting. Along with that, cumulative shrinking is proposed to map responses from the temporal region of the anterior [[thalamus]] that references the spatial positions. The plasticity model combined with the structure of [[Medial pallidum|medial pallium]] model provides a structured network of neural mechanisms, contributing towards dishabituation and habituation alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=D.|last2=Arbib|first2=M. A.|date=1992-01-01|title=Modeling the dishabituation hierarchy: the role of the primordial hippocampus|journal=Biological Cybernetics|volume=67|issue=6|pages=535–544|issn=0340-1200|pmid=1472577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, this phenomenon is neither indicative to counteract the emphasis of an existing habituation but instead, organizes an independent neuronal process, nor resulted by facilitation, as the etymology may indicate.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.77/papers/Wang-Arbib.biocyb92.pdf|title=Modeling the dishabituation hierarchy: The role of the primordial hippocampus|last=|first=|date=|website=Department of Computer Science and Engineering {{!}} The Ohio State UniversityAccessibilityPrivacy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the above establish the process of dishabituation, where responding to a repetitive stimulus increases and has been documented in a wide range of organisms - from single-celled animals to primates - which is thought to allow an organism to reflexively either filter out or consider, all forms of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=caf8iat1C7sC&amp;pg=PA568&amp;lpg=PA568&amp;dq=dishabituation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o_3r4xw11R&amp;sig=8W762TpRgufy_up-RsJoSmNHGWU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3r_2e2PjSAhVIi7wKHSqmCHw4ChDoAQhJMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=dishabituation&amp;f=false|title=The Design of Animal Communication|last=Hauser|first=Marc D.|last2=Konishi|first2=Mark|date=2017-03-29|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262582230|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also characterized as an emancipation of an existing prey-catching behavior. Sometimes however, the inconsistency in dishabituation of behavioral response is brought-on by mismatch between the 1st and 2nd stimuli, which in-turn is due to the occurrence of inhibition by habituation, to the existing stimulus.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Application ==
Dishabituation shows an increase in reward effectiveness as it produces a heightened behavioral response to sensitization of [[arousal]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other studies also show that it is caused by [[mind-wandering]], where with distributed working process as opposed to practising in mass, the learning behavior is enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/cep-a0031569.pdf|title=The Costs and Benefits of Mind-Wandering: A Review|last=|first=|date=|website=American Psychological Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the development of preterm infants, the dishabituation process also provides with an approach for the early diagnosis of cognitive status and most importantly, their mental faculties performances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kavsek|first=Michael|title=Predicting Later IQ from Infant Visual Habituation and Dishabituation: A Meta-Analysis|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ731762|journal=Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=369–393|doi=10.1016/j.appdev.2004.04.006|issn=0193-3973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''doctrine of equivalents''' is a legal rule in many (but not all) of the world's [[patent]] systems that allows a [[court]] to hold a party liable for [[patent infringement]] even though the infringing device or process does not fall within the literal scope of a [[claim (patent)|patent claim]], but nevertheless is equivalent to the claimed [[invention]].  U.S. Judge [[Learned Hand]] has described its purpose as being "to temper unsparing logic and prevent an infringer from stealing the benefit of the invention".&lt;ref&gt;''Royal Typewriter Co. v. [[Remington Rand]], Inc.'', 168 F.2d 691, 692 (2d Cir. 1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards for determining equivalents==

=== Germany ===
German courts typically apply a three-step test known as Schneidmesser's questions.&lt;ref&gt;Schneidmesser II; GRUR 2002, p 513. [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]], March 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These questions are:
#Does the variant solve the problem underlying the invention with means that objectively have the same effect?
#Would the [[person skilled in the art]], using the [[common general knowledge]], have realised at the [[Priority right|priority date]] that the variant has the same effect?
#Are the considerations which the skilled person takes into account for the variant in the light of the meaning of the invention close enough to the considerations taken into account for the literal solution protected by the claims, such that the skilled person will consider the variant as a solution which is equivalent to the literal one?

All of the above questions need to be answered in the affirmative in order to demonstrate equivalent infringement. In addition, an allegation of equivalent infringement needs to withstand the [[Formstein defence|Formstein test]].&lt;ref&gt;Schneidmesser II; GRUR 1986, p 803. [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]], April 29, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding question reads:
:Does the variant, having regard to the [[Prior art|state of the art]], lack [[Novelty (patent)|novelty]] or is the variant [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|obvious]] to a person skilled in the art?

=== Ireland ===

Ireland appears to subscribe to a doctrine of equivalents. In ''[[Farbwerke Hoechst v Intercontinental Pharmaceuticals (Eire) Ltd]]'' (1968), a case involving a patent of a chemical process, the High Court found that the defendant had infringed the plaintiff's patent despite the fact that the defendant had substituted the starting material specified in the patent claim for another material. Expert evidence showed that any technician who failed to obtain a good result using the specified starting material would try the replacement material. The two materials were therefore held to be chemically equivalent, and the replacement of one with the other by the defendant did not prevent a finding and injunction against him.

=== Switzerland ===
On 21 March 2013, the [[Federal Patent Court of Switzerland]] adopted an approach similar to the three-prong test applied in [[Germany]]. The court based its decision on the three questions:&lt;ref&gt;Kontrazeptiva; GRUR Int 2014, p 543. [[Federal Patent Court of Switzerland]], March 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Do the replaced features have the same objective function (same effect)? 
#Are the replaced features and their same objective function obvious to a [[person skilled in the art]] on the basis of the teaching of the patent (accessibility)? 
#After reading the wording of the claim in light of the description, would a [[person skilled in the art]] consider the replaced features as a solution of equal value (equal value)?

The court denied equivalent infringement of EP0918791B3, since paragraph 19 of EP0918791B3 explicitly teaches that toxic chromium compounds may be replaced by metallic catalysts. A person skilled in the art would not consider the organic catalyst TEMPO as a solution of equal value to the ruthenium salts specified in claim 1. The answer to the third question was negative.

The court also ruled that there was equivalent infringement of EP1149840B1, since all questions of the three-prong test were answered in the affirmative. The court set forth that the replacement of the claimed p-Toluenesulfonic acid with pyridine/water constituted basic knowledge taught during the first years of an undergraduate course in organic chemistry.

In ''Urinal valve II'',&lt;ref&gt;Patentverletzung durch Nachahmung; GRUR Int 1/2017, p 40. [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Federal Supreme Court]], October 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]] basically affirmed the three-prong test applied by the Federal Patent Court. The Supreme Court still partly reversed the Federal Patent Court’s earlier ruling on case [https://www.bundespatentgericht.ch/fileadmin/entscheide/O2014_002_Teilurteil_2016-11-21.pdf O2014_002]. The Supreme Court contended (reasons 6.4) that a second embodiment of the urinal valve fully implemented the key teachings of the asserted patent EP1579133, even though the second embodiment was not literally covered by the wording of the relevant claim. The Court went on to establish equivalent infringement.

=== United Kingdom ===
As a signatory to the European Patent Convention (EPC), the UK is required to follow the Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 of the EPC, which requires member states to draw a balance between interpreting patent claims with strict literalism (with the description and drawings only helping resolve ambiguity) and regarding the claims as a mere guideline only.

The [[United Kingdom]] had historically never employed a doctrine of equivalents approach.  Instead, the UKIPO employed a [[purposive approach]] to assessing the scope of the claims, which applied to both patentability and infringement.  The latest UK case law on claim interpretation is found in '[[Improver Corp v Remington Consumer Products Ltd]]' (1990) and the [[House of Lords]] decision in 'Kirin-Amgen' (2004).  The so-called 'Improver' (or Protocol) questions found in the former are a widely used three-step test for deciding direct patent infringement.  

In July 2017, [[Lord Neuberger]] in ''Actavis UK v Eli Lilly'' introduced a new doctrine of equivalents test.  The Supreme Court set out three questions to consider when determining whether a patent infringed the claims as an equivalent:&lt;ref&gt;Actavis UK Ltd and others v Eli Lilly and Company [2017] UKSC 48. [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], 12 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

# "Notwithstanding that it is not within the literal meaning of the relevant claim(s) of the patent, does the variant achieve substantially the same result in substantially the same way as the invention, ie the inventive concept revealed by the patent?"
# "Would it be obvious to the person skilled in the art, reading the patent at the priority date, but knowing that the variant achieves substantially the same result as the invention, that it does so in substantially the same way as the invention?"
# "Would such a reader of the patent have concluded that the patentee nonetheless intended that strict compliance with the literal meaning of the relevant claim(s) of the patent was an essential requirement of the invention?"

The first two questions must be answered in the affirmative, and the third question in the negative to demonstrate equivalent infringement.

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], the doctrine of equivalents analysis is applied to individual claim limitations, not to the invention as a whole.&lt;ref name="Warner-Jenkinson Co."&gt;''See [[Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co.|Warner-Jenkinson Co.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The legal test, articulated in ''[[Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co.]]'' (1997), is whether the difference between the feature in the accused device and the limitation literally recited in the patent claim is "insubstantial."

One way of determining whether a difference is "insubstantial" or not is called the "triple identity" test.  Under the triple-identity test, the difference between the feature in the accused device and the limitation literally recited in the patent claim may be found to be "insubstantial" if the feature in the accused device:
#Performs substantially the same function
#In substantially the same way
#To obtain the same result
as the limitation literally recited in the patent claim.  See ''[[Graver Tank &amp; Manufacturing Co. v. Linde Air Products Co.]]'', (1950).

The Court also explained that the doctrine of equivalents applies if two elements are interchangeable and a person with ordinary skill in the art would have known that the elements were interchangeable at the time of infringement.&lt;ref name="Warner-Jenkinson Co."/&gt;

In the United States, the doctrine of equivalents is limited by [[prosecution history estoppel]].  Under prosecution history estoppel, if the patentee abandoned through an amendment to the patent application certain literal claim coverage (e.g., by narrowing the literal scope of the patent claim), then the patentee is estopped from later arguing that the surrendered coverage is insubstantially different from the literally claimed limitation.&lt;ref&gt;''See [[Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposed equivalents also cannot cover, or ensnare, the prior art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20140611070955/http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/08-1240.pdf] ''Depuy Spine, Inc. v. Biedermann Motech GMBH'' (Fed. Cir. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States also has a statutory equivalents doctrine that is codified in 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 6, which extends to structural equivalents. However, while the general doctrine of equivalents extends to technological equivalents developed after the issuance of a claim, the statutory structural equivalents in 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 6 extends only to equivalents available at issuance.{{primary source inline|date=August 2016}}

== Harmonization attempts ==
Attempts have been made to harmonize the doctrine of equivalents.

For instance, Article 21(2) of 1991 [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]]'s "Basic Proposal" for a Treaty Supplementing the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] states:
:"(a) (...) a claim shall be considered to cover not only all the elements as expressed in the claim but also equivalents.
:(b) An element ("the equivalent element") shall generally be considered as being equivalent to an element as expressed in a claim if, at the time of any alleged infringement, either of the following conditions is fulfilled in regard to the invention as claimed:
::(i) the equivalent element performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way and produces substantially the same result as the element as expressed in the claim, or
::(ii) it is obvious to a person skilled in the art that the same result as that achieved by means of the element as expressed in the claim can be achieved by means of the equivalent element."

The [[EPC 2000]], which came into effect on 13 December 2007, included an amended "Protocol on the interpretation of {{EPC Article|69}}" intended to bring about uniformity at a national level between contracting states to the EPC when interpreting claims.&lt;ref name="EPC2000"&gt;"An Overview of the New European Patent Convention and its Potential Impact on European Patent Practice", S.J. Farmer and M. Grund, Bio-Science Law Review, Vol. 9, Issue 2, pages 53-61&lt;/ref&gt; The amended text reads:
:''For the purpose of determining the extent of protection conferred by a European patent, due account shall be taken of any element which is an equivalent to an element specified in the claims.''
However, no definition of what was meant by an "equivalent" was included in the Protocol and it is expected that this lack of a binding definition will do little to achieve the desired uniform interpretation.&lt;ref name="EPC2000" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3389">'''ERG theory''' is a theory in [[psychology]] proposed by [[Clayton Alderfer]].
[[File:Alderfer's ERG Theory.jpg|thumb]]

Alderfer further developed [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] by categorizing the hierarchy into his '''ERG theory''' ([[Existence]], [[Coefficient of relationship|Relatedness]] and Growth). The existence group is concerned with providing the basic material existence requirements of humans. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs is those of relatedness&amp;nbsp;– the desire people have for maintaining important [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relationships]]. These social and status desires require interaction with others if they are to be satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs: an intrinsic desire for [[personal development]]. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under [[self-actualization]].
Alderfer categorized the lower order needs (Physiological and Safety) into the Existence category. He fit Maslow's interpersonal love and esteem needs into the Relatedness category. The Growth category contained the self-actualization and self-esteem needs. Alderfer also proposed a regression theory to go along with the ERG theory. He said that when needs in a higher category are not met then individuals redouble the efforts invested in a lower category need. For example if self-actualization or [[self-esteem]] is not met then individuals will invest more effort in the relatedness category in the hopes of achieving the higher need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.washington.edu/inde495/lece.htm Design in the Manufacturing Firm syllabus] University of Washington Industrial Engineering course syllabus.

'''Equality feminism''' is a subset of the overall [[feminism]] movement that focuses on the basic similarities between men and women, and whose ultimate goal is the equality of the sexes in all domains.  This includes economic and political equality, equal access within the workplace, freedom from oppressive gender stereotyping, and an androgynous worldview.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;Stanford University. [http://genderedinnovations.stanford.edu/terms/feminism.html Gendered Innovations]. Retrieved 3 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=Citation refers to "Liberal Feminism, or the Equality Approach", article does not mention equality feminism| talk=Lead section|date=February 2018}}

Feminist theory seeks to promote the legal status of women as equal and undifferentiated from that of men. While equality feminists largely agree that men and women have basic biological differences in anatomy and frame, they argue that on a psychological level, the use of ration or reason is androgynous. For equality feminists, men and women are equal in terms of their ability to reason, achieve goals, and prosper in both the work and home front.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for this entire paragraph|date=February 2018}}

Equality feminism was the dominant version of feminism following [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" (1792). Wollstonecraft made the case that women's equality to men manifests itself in education and worker's rights, and further produced a proverbial roadmap in order for future women to follow in terms of activism and feminist theorizing.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, Mary. [https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/vorow10.txt "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman"]. Retrieved 4 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, active equality feminist include [[Simone de Beauvoir]], the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] Leaders, [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Lucretia Coffin Mott]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Betty Friedan]], and [[Gloria Steinem]].

While equality feminism was the dominant perspective of feminism during the 19th and 20th century, the 1980s and 1990s brought about a new focus in popular feminism on [[difference feminism]], or the essential differences between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;The University of Alabama. [http://www.uah.edu/woolf/feminism_kinds.htm "Kinds of Feminism"]. Retrieved 3 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to equality feminism, this view advocates for the celebration of the "feminine" by focusing on traditionally viewed female traits, such as empathy, nurturing, and care. While equality feminists view human nature as essentially androgynous, difference feminists claim that this viewpoint aligns the "good" with male-dominated stereotypes, thus sticking within the patriarchal framework of society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/care-eth/ Ethics of Care] (International Encyclopedia of Philosophy).  Retrieved 2 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In both law and in theology women were portrayed as both physically and intellectually inferior.  One of the first feminist documents that set the stage for feministic movements occurred when Mary Wollstonecraft wrote "Vindication of the Rights of Woman" in 1792.  While this literature was seen as rebellious at the time it echoed the feelings of women throughout [[France]] as women's republican clubs demanded that liberty, equality and fraternity should be applied to both men and women.  While this movement gained notoriety it was eventually extinguished by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s Code Napoleon that established that the husband had complete control over the family and regressed equality feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Landes, Joan B. Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution. Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1988. Retrieved 1 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

While much of the equality feminism movements that occurred in France weren't successful, they influenced much of the movements that occurred in North America in the 1800s.  Both [[Abigail Adams]] and [[Mercy Otis Warren]] fought for woman's emancipation to be included in the constitution of 1776 to no avail.  However, Elizabeth Cade Stanton, Lucretia Coffin Mott, along with thousands of other women changed the dynamics of equality feminism forever with the women's convention at Seneca Falls N.Y. in 1848.  Here along with independence they demanded full legal equality in all aspects of life (education, commercial opportunities, compensation, voting rights, etc.).  With the influence of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, this movement evolved into Europe.  In 1869 [[John Stuart Mill]] published ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' in which he argued that equality between the sexes would translate to more moral and intellectual advancement which in turn would result in more human happiness to everyone.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;{{rp|87–89}}

After the expansion into Europe, the movement stifled its growth until 1920 where the [[woman suffrage]] movement occurred, as many women were divided when determining whether or not women were on equal standing with men.  This continued until the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] was established in 1946 to secure equal political, economic and educational opportunities for women throughout the world.  In 1949, a French Existentialist Simone de Beauvoir published the work ''[[The Second Sex]]'', in which she debunks many of the claims made towards women and fights for gender equality.  In 1963 another literature pertaining to equality feminism arose, with Betty Friedan's ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' in which she discussed "the problem that has no name", being the widespread unhappiness of women in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=FB&gt;Friedan, Betty. "The Feminine Mystique." The Essential Feminist Reader. Ed. Estelle B. Freedman. New York: Random House Group, 2007. Retrieved 2 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  She uses this information to describe many of the gender inequalities that society has created that has resulted in this unhappiness, such as giving up her psychology career to tend to her children.  Using these literatures as a guide feminism once again arose in the United States with the development of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) formed in 1966. This organization fought for the removal of all legal and social barriers placed upon women to once again influence true equality between men and women.  In 1972 women leaders such as [[Bella Abzug]], [[Betty Friedan]], and [[Gloria Steinem]] pushed the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] through Congress; however, it fell short of ratification by 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Castro, Ginette.

== Equality feminist theory ==

Equality feminist theory is the extension of the equality of the male and female into theoretical and philosophical fields of thought. At its core, equality feminist theory advocates for the equal standing of both men and women in terms of desires, wants, goals, and achievement. Thus, from this viewpoint, the basis of human nature outside of culture is androgynous, neutral, and equal.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=Citation refers to "Liberal Feminism, or the Equality Approach", article does not mention equality feminism| talk=Lead section|date=February 2018}}

Much of equality feminism focuses on the relation of reason as the central tenet of both men and women equally. Mary Wollstonecraft in "A Vindication on the Rights of Women" (1792) claimed that women should enjoy the same legal and political rights as men on the grounds that they are human beings. Specifically, Wollstonecraft argues for "[a]sserting the rights which women in common with men ought to contend for".&lt;ref name=WM&gt;Wollstonecraft, Mary. [https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/vorow10.txt A Vindication of the Rights of Women]. Retrieved 4 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} In this way, both men and women should have equal access to rights because they have an equal access to the capacity to reason. Similarly, ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1869), [[John Stuart Mill]] advocated that society ought to be arranged according to reason and that 'accidents of birth' is irrelevant. Thus, because both men and women are governed by principles of reason, then the biological elements such as sex, gender, and race aren't contributing factors to the essence of the individual. Mill notes that within a patriarchal society, "Men hold women in subjection by representing to them meekness, submissiveness resignation of all individual will into the hands of a man as an essential part of sexual attractiveness".&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;Mills, John Stuart and Okin, Susan Moller. [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_subjection_of_women.html?id=PK_BGGCU_dsC ''The Subjection of Women'']. Hacking Publishing, 1998. Retrieved 4 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–127}} In this way, to say that women have essential characteristics of submission by nature of their sex is an oppressive measure that contradicts the basic principle of reason that governs all human nature.

== Important figures ==

===Mary Wollstonecraft===
In 1792 Wollstonecraft wrote one of the earliest works in feminist philosophy and though she doesn't explicitly state that men and women are equal she does call for equality in various realms of life which set the stage for future equality feminist works. In her piece ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects'', Wollstonecraft argues that women should have an education comparable to their position in society.  She articulates her argument by claiming that since women were the primary care givers they could be able to better educate their own children and be seen as "companions" to the husband rather than wives if they were given this opportunity.  Instead of being considered "property" that were exchanged through marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that women are human beings and therefore deserve equal fundamental rights as men.&lt;ref name=WM/&gt;{{rp|74–88}}

===John Stuart Mill===
In 1869, John Stuart Mill with the help of his wife [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] published ''The Subjection of Women'', in it he argued for equality between the sexes.  John Stuart Mill was able to draw off of some of the arguments his wife made in her essay ''The Enfranchisement of Women'', in which she opened the door of favoring equality for both men and women.  Mill believe that the moral and intellectual advancement from giving women the opportunity to be considered equal would translate to greater happiness for everyone involved.  He believed that all humans had the capability of being educated and civilized, with which he argued women should be given the right to vote.  Throughout the book Mill continues to argue that both men and women should be able to vote to defend their rights and be able to have the opportunity to stand on their own two feet morally and intellectually, and constantly used his position in Parliament to advocate for [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mills (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)". plato.stanford.edu. Retrieved 30 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mill attacks many of the arguments that women are inferior at certain activities and therefore be forbidden from doing them by saying that women aren't given the opportunities and therefore we don't know what women are capable of.  He claims that males are making an authoritative statement without evidence, an argument solely based on speculation.  Mill claims that by giving women this opportunity to figure out exactly what they were capable of would double the mass of mental faculties to serve humanity, and could produce a great impact on human development.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;{{rp|56–79}}

===Simone de Beauvoir===
[[Simone de Beauvoir]] played a large role in equality feminism with the publishing of her book ''[[The Second Sex]]'', broken into 3 parts.  In the first part, "Destiny", de Beauvoir discusses the relationship of male to female in a variety of creatures before comparing human beings.  This physiological data along with psychoanalytical data help her come to the conclusion that there wasn't a historical defeat of the female sex.  Part two, "History", outlines the two factors in the evolution of women's condition: participation in production and freedom from reproductive slavery.  In these chapters, de Beauvoir compares being a women to being like an animal, similar to the way male animals dominated a female.  Finally in part three, "Myths", de Beauvoir discusses the perceived "everlasting disappointment" of women from a male heterosexual point of view.  She then comes back and discusses full reality of the situation to show the discrepancies between perception and reality.&lt;ref&gt;Beauvoir, Simone De. ''The Second Sex''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout her literary career, de Beauvoir helped unravel some of the "myths" associated with perceptions in gender and set forth a strong message that men and women should be treated equal with equal rights.

===Betty Friedan===
[[Betty Friedan]] became one of the most recognized equality feminists after writing the book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', in which she discusses "the problem that has no name", female unhappiness in the 1950s and 1960s.  It was through this book that Friedman was able to address many of the problems and the widespread recognition allowed her to later become president of the [[National Organization for Women]](NOW).  

Throughout the piece Friedan addressed the problem that women had "wanting more than a husband, children, and a home".  Friedan discusses the societal expectations of raising children and how this caused many women to not be able to do what they wanted.  Many decisions that were made for women were made by men and this had worn out many women.  She discusses the problem of education and that many families solely focused on education for the male children and women were instead "assigned to be married to fulfill child-bearing expectations".&lt;ref name=FB/&gt;  It was through the impact of this piece of literature that women were finally given a voice to say it was okay to not want to conform to societal expectations and fight for equality of opportunities, choices, marriage, education, and voting.

== Objections ==

The main objection raised to equality feminism comes in the form of [[difference feminism]], the belief that emphasizes the differences between men and women. This viewpoint, as championed by such feminists such as [[Carol Gilligan]], [[Joan Tronto]], [[Eva Feder Kittay]], [[Genevieve Lloyd]], [[Alison Jaggar]], and Ynestra King, developed out of the rejection of the androgynous view of human nature as emphasized in equality feminism. Begun largely in the 1980s, this viewpoint makes the case that equality feminism fails to account for the uniquely female experience, and thus creates the male perspective as the dominant aspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley,Victoria L. (2012). Feminisms Matter: Debates. Theories. Activism. Toronto, Ontario: University of Toronto Press Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-4426-0500-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19954">'''Exposure therapy''' is a technique in [[behavior therapy]] to treat [[anxiety disorder]]s. Exposure therapy involves exposing the target patient to the anxiety source or its context without the intention to cause any danger. Doing so is thought to help them overcome their [[anxiety]] or [[Distress (medicine)|distress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Myers|Davis|2007|pp=141–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Joseph | first1 = J.S. | last2 = Gray | first2 = M.J. | year = 2008 | title = Exposure Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder | journal = Journal of Behavior Analysis of Offender and Victim: Treatment and Prevention | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 69–80 | doi=10.1037/h0100457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procedurally, it is similar to the fear [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]] paradigm developed studying laboratory rodents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marks, I. |year=1979 |title=Exposure therapy for phobias and obsessive-compulsive disorders |journal=Hosp Pract |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–8 |pmid=34562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myers and Davis 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Myers | first1 = K.M. | last2 = Davis | first2 = M.  | year = 2007 | title = Mechanisms of Fear Extinction | url =http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v12/n2/full/4001939a.html | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 12 | doi =10.1038/sj.mp.4001939 | pages = 120–50 |ref=harv | pmid=17160066 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in the treatment of disorders such as [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[social anxiety disorder]], [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder|PTSD,]] and [[specific phobia]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huppert | first1 =  | last2 = Roth | first2 =  | year = 2003 | title = Treating Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder with Exposure and Response Prevention | url =http://www.baojournal.com/BAT%20Journal/VOL-4/BAT-4-1.pdf  |format=PDF | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 4 |issue = 1| pages = 66–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==

===Generalized anxiety disorder===
There is empirical evidence that exposure therapy can be an effective treatment for people with [[generalized anxiety disorder]], citing specifically in vivo exposure therapy, which has greater effectiveness than imaginal exposure in regards to generalized anxiety disorder. The aim of in vivo exposure treatment is to promote emotional regulation using systematic and controlled therapeutic exposure to traumatic stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parsons | first1 = T.D. | last2 = Rizzo | first2 = A.A. | year = 2008 | title = Affective outcomes of virtual reality exposure therapy for anxiety and specific phobias: A meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 250–261 |pmid=17720136 | doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2007.07.007 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005-7916(07)00045-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phobia===
Exposure therapy is the most successful known treatment for phobias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chambless |first1=D.L. |last2=Ollendick |first2=T.H. |year=2001 |title=Empirically supported psychological interventions: Controversies and Evidence |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=52 |issue=1| pages=685–716 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.685 |pmid=11148322 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several published meta-analyses included studies of one-to-three hour single-session treatments of phobias, using imaginal exposure. At a post-treatment follow-up four years later 90% of people retained a considerable reduction in fear, avoidance, and overall level of impairment, while 65% no longer experienced any symptoms of a specific phobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=J. S. |last2=Tolin |first2=D. F. |year=2011 |title=Exposure therapy for anxiety disorders: Theoretical mechanisms of exposure and treatment strategies |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/anxiety/exposure-therapy-anxiety-disorders |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agoraphobia]] and [[social anxiety disorder]] are examples of phobias that have been successfully treated by exposure therapy. Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or that help wouldn't be available if things go wrong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/agoraphobia/|title=Agoraphobia|author=|date=|website=nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;, originating from the Ancient Greek term "Agora" or Marketplace, while social anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by a significant amount of fear in one or more social situations. Such fears can be very debilitating in themselves, and in addition patients often worry about showing anxiety and losing control in public.&lt;ref name="Vogele"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vögele |first1=Claus |last2=Ehlers |first2=Anke |last3=Meyer |first3=Andrea H. |last4=Frank |first4=Monika |last5=Hahlweg |first5=Kurt |last6=Margraf |first6=Jürgen |date=2010 |title=Cognitive mediation of clinical improvement after intensive exposure therapy of agoraphobia and social phobia |journal=Depression and Anxiety |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=294–301 |doi=10.1002/da.20651 |pmid=20037922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-traumatic stress disorder===
[[Virtual reality therapy|Virtual reality exposure (VRE) therapy]] is a modern but effective treatment of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). This method was tested on several active duty Army soldiers, using an immersive computer simulation of military settings over six sessions. Self-reported PTSD symptoms of these soldiers were greatly diminished following the treatment.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reger | first1 = G.M. | last2 = Gahm | first2 = G.A. | year = 2008 | title = Virtual reality exposure therapy for active duty soldiers | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology: In Session | volume = 64 | issue = 8| pages = 940–6 |pmid=18612993 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20512 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure therapy has shown promise in the treatment of [[co-morbid]] PTSD and [[substance abuse]].

=== Obsessive compulsive disorder ===
Exposure and response prevention (also known as exposure and ritual prevention; ERP or EX/RP) is a variant of exposure therapy that is recommended by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), the American Psychiatric Association (APA), and the Mayo Clinic as first-line treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) citing that it has the richest empirical support for both youth and adolescent outcomes.&lt;ref name=AAP2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koran|first1=LM|last2=Hanna|first2=GL|last3=Hollander|first3=E|last4=Nestadt|first4=G|last5=Simpson|first5=HB|last6=American Psychiatric|first6=Association.|title=Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=July 2007|volume=164|issue=7 Suppl|pages=5–53|pmid=17849776|url=http://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/ocd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AACAP2012&gt;{{cite journal|title=Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|date=January 2012|volume=51|issue=1|pages=98–113|pmid=22176943|url=http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567(11)00882-3/fulltext|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2011.09.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERP is predicated on the idea that a [[Psychotherapy|therapeutic]] effect is achieved as subjects confront their fears, but refrain from engaging in the escape response or ritual that delays or eliminates distress.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnoznH2c7esC|title=Exposure Therapy for Anxiety: Principles and Practice|last=Abramowitz|first=Jonathan S.|last2=Deacon|first2=Brett J.|last3=Whiteside|first3=Stephen P. H.|date=2011-03-14|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=9781609180171}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of individuals with OCD or an anxiety disorder, there is a thought or situation that causes distress. Individuals usually combat this distress through specific behaviors that include avoidance or rituals. However, ERP involves purposefully evoking fear, anxiety, and or distress in the individual by exposing him/her to the feared stimulus. The response prevention then involves having the individual refrain from the ritualistic or otherwise compulsive behavior that functions to decrease distress. The patient is then taught to tolerate distress until it fades away on its own, thereby learning that rituals are not always necessary to decrease distress or anxiety. Over repeated practice of ERP, patients with OCD expect to find that they can have obsessive thoughts and images but not have the need to engage in compulsive rituals to decrease distress.&lt;ref name=AAP2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=AACAP2012/&gt;

The AACAP's practice parameters for OCD recommends cognitive behavioral therapy, and more specifically ERP, as first line treatment for youth with mild to moderate severity OCD and combination psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for severe OCD.&lt;ref name=AACAP2012/&gt; The Cochrane Review's examinations of different randomized control trials echoes repeated findings of the superiority of ERP over waitlist control or pill-placebos, the superiority of combination ERP and pharmacotherapy, but similar effect sizes of efficacy between ERP or pharmacotherapy alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Kearney | first1 = RT | last2 = Anstey | first2 = K | last3 = von Sanden | first3 = C | last4 = Hunt | first4 = A | year = 2006| title = Behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2006 | issue = 4| page = CD004856 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004856.pub2 | pmid=17054218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Exposure therapy is based on the principle of [[respondent conditioning]] often termed Pavlovian extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marks, Isaac Meyer |title=Cure and care of neuroses: theory and practice of behavioral psychotherapy |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1981 |isbn=0-471-08808-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exposure therapist identifies the cognitions, emotions and physiological arousal that accompany a fear-inducing stimulus and then tries to break the pattern of escape that maintains the fear. This is done by exposing the patient to progressively stronger fear-inducing stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=De Silva, P. |author2=Rachman, S. |year=1981 |title=Is exposure a necessary condition for fear-reduction? |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=227–32 |doi=10.1016/0005-7967(81)90006-1 |pmid= 6117277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear is minimized at each of a series of steadily escalating steps or challenges (a [[Exposure hierarchy|hierarchy]]), which can be explicit ("static") or implicit ("dynamic" — see [[Method of Factors]]) until the fear is finally gone.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 552.&lt;/ref&gt; The patient is able to terminate the procedure at any time.

There are three types of exposure procedures. The first is in vivo or "real life." This type exposes the patient to actual fear-inducing situations. For example, if someone fears public speaking, the person may be asked to give a speech to a small group of people. The second type of exposure is imaginal, where patients are asked to imagine a situation that they are afraid of. This procedure is helpful for people who need to confront feared thoughts and memories. The third type of exposure is interoceptive, which may be used for more specific disorders such as panic or post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients confront feared bodily symptoms such as increased heart rate and shortness of breath. All types of exposure may be used together or separately.&lt;ref name="Foa"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foa | first1 = E. B. | year = 2011 | title = Prolonged exposure therapy: present, and future | url = | journal = Depression and Anxiety | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 1043–1047 | doi = 10.1002/da.20907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While evidence clearly supports the effectiveness of exposure therapy, some clinicians are uncomfortable using imaginal exposure therapy, especially in cases of PTSD. They may not understand it, are not confident in their own ability to use it, or more commonly, they see significant contraindications for their client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/psych_faculty/7/ |title=A Survey of Psychologists' Attitudes Towards and Utilization of Exposure Therapy for PTSD |publisher=Digital Commons @ Trinity |accessdate=13 June 2011 |author1=C. Becker |author2=C. Zayfert |author3=E. Anderson }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaeger | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Echiverri | first2 = A. | last3 = Zoellner | first3 = L.A. | last4 = Post | first4 = L. | last5 = Feeny | first5 = N.C. | year = 2009 | title = Factors Associated with Choice of Exposure Therapy for PTSD | url =http://www.baojournal.com/IJBCT/IJBCT-VOL-5/IJBCT--5-2.pdf |format=PDF | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 294–310 |pmid=22545029 |pmc=3337146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flooding (psychology)|Flooding]] therapy also exposes the patient to feared stimuli, but it is quite distinct in that flooding starts at the most feared item in a fear [[Exposure hierarchy|hierarchy]], while exposure starts at the least fear-inducing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=de Silva, P. |author2=Rachman, S. |title=Exposure and fear-reduction |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=151–2 |year=1983 |pmid=6838470 |doi=10.1016/0005-7967(83)90160-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cobb, J. |title=Behaviour therapy in phobic and obsessional disorders |journal=Psychiatr Dev |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=351–65 |year=1983 |pmid=6144099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exposure and response prevention===
In the exposure and response prevention (ERP or EX/RP) variation of exposure therapy, the resolution to refrain from the [[escape response]] is to be maintained at all times and not just during specific practice sessions. Thus, not only does the subject experience [[habituation]] to the feared stimulus, they also practice a fear-incompatible behavioral response to the stimulus. The distinctive feature is that individuals confront their fears and discontinue their escape response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnoznH2c7esC|title=Exposure Therapy for Anxiety: Principles and Practice|last=Abramowitz|first=Jonathan S.|last2=Deacon|first2=Brett J.|last3=Whiteside|first3=Stephen P. H.|date=2011-03-14|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=9781609180171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The American Psychiatric Association recommends ERP for the treatment of OCD, citing that ERP has the richest empirical support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koran|first1=LM|last2=Hanna|first2=GL|last3=Hollander|first3=E|last4=Nestadt|first4=G|last5=Simpson|first5=HB|last6=American Psychiatric|first6=Association.|title=Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=July 2007|volume=164|issue=7 Suppl|pages=5–53|pmid=17849776|url=http://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/ocd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this type of therapy typically causes some short-term anxiety, this facilitates long-term reduction in obsessive and compulsive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Exposure Therapy for Anxiety: Principles and Practice|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pnoznH2c7esC&amp;pg=PT103|publisher = Guilford Press|date = 2011-03-14|isbn = 978-1-60918-017-1|first = Jonathan S.|last = Abramowitz|first2 = Brett J.|last2 = Deacon|first3 = Stephen P. H.|last3 = Whiteside}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|103}}

==History==
The use of exposure as a mode of therapy began in the 1950s, at a time when psychodynamic views dominated Western clinical practice and behavioral therapy was first emerging. South African psychologists and psychiatrists first used exposure as a way to reduce pathological fears, such as phobias and anxiety-related problems, and they brought their methods to England in the [[Maudsley Hospital]] training program.&lt;ref name="Abramowitz, J. S. 2010"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jonathan S. |last1=Abramowitz |first2=Brett Jason |last2=Deacon |first3=Stephen P. H. |last3=Whiteside |title=Exposure Therapy for Anxiety: Principles and Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnoznH2c7esC |year=2010 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-60918-016-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Wolpe]] (1915–1997) was one of the first psychiatrists to spark interest in treating psychiatric problems as behavioral issues. He sought consultation with other behavioral psychologists, among them James G. Taylor (1897–1973), who worked in the psychology department of the [[University of Cape Town]] in South Africa. Although most of his work went unpublished, Taylor was the first psychologist known to use exposure therapy treatment for [[anxiety]], including methods of situational exposure with response prevention—a common exposure therapy technique still being used.&lt;ref name="Abramowitz, J. S. 2010"/&gt;
Since the 1950s several sorts of exposure therapy have been developed, including [[systematic desensitization]], [[Flooding (psychology)|flooding]], implosive therapy, [[prolonged exposure therapy]], in vivo exposure therapy, and imaginal exposure therapy.&lt;ref name="Abramowitz, J. S. 2010"/&gt;

==Mindfulness==
A 2015 review pointed out parallels between exposure therapy and [[mindfulness]], stating that mindful meditation "resembles an exposure situation because [mindfulness] practitioners 'turn towards their emotional experience', bring acceptance to bodily and affective responses, and refrain from engaging in internal reactivity towards it."&lt;ref name=NRN2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tang|first1=YY|last2=Hölzel|first2=BK|last3=Posner|first3=MI|title=The neuroscience of mindfulness meditation.|journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience|date=April 2015|volume=16|issue=4|pages=213–25|pmid=25783612|doi=10.1038/nrn3916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaging studies have shown that the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], [[hippocampus]], and the [[amygdala]] are all affected by exposure therapy; imaging studies have shown similar activity in these regions with mindfulness training.&lt;ref name=NRN2015/&gt;

==Organizations and certification==
There are a number of organizations of behavior therapists around the world. The Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABA) offers a certification in behavior therapy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abainternational.org/|title=Welcome - Association for Behavior Analysis International|author=|date=|website=www.abainternational.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; to therapists who demonstrate competence in exposure therapy.

==Research==
Exposure therapy can be investigated in the laboratory using Pavlovian [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] paradigms. Using rodents such as rats or mice to study extinction allows for the investigation of underlying neurobiological mechanisms involved, as well as testing of pharmacological adjuncts to improve extinction learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milad|first=Mohammed R.|last2=Quirk|first2=Gregory J.|date=2011-11-30|title=Fear Extinction as a Model for Translational Neuroscience: Ten Years of Progress|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.psych.121208.131631|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=63|issue=1|pages=129–151|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.121208.131631|issn=0066-4308|pmc=4942586|pmid=22129456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hamilton v.

== Background ==
Mary Hamilton (October 13, 1935—November 11, 2002)&lt;ref name=NCNobit&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030827091832/www.northcountynews.com/Archives2002/Nov_13_2002/2002_1113obits.htm |title=Obituaries |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=13 November 2002 |website=The North Country News |publisher=The North Country News |access-date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a field secretary for the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] in [[Alabama]]. In 1963, along with hundreds of others, she was arrested during civil rights protests in [[Gadsden, Alabama|Gadsden]].

At a ''[[habeas corpus]]'' hearing on June 25 challenging the legitimacy of those arrests, she refused to answer questions on the witness stand until she was addressed with the same courtesy accorded white witnesses. At that time, in the South and in many other parts of the U.S., it was customary for judges and prosecutors to address white witnesses by last names and courtesy titles, such as "Mr. Jones" or "Mrs. Smith", while addressing all nonwhite witnesses by the first name without [[honorific]].&lt;ref name=WBHM&gt;{{cite news | title=The Miss Mary Case | publisher=[[WBHM]] (Birmingham, Alabama) | accessdate=July 13, 2013 | url=http://www.wbhm.org/News/2013/missmarycase}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the county prosecutor addressed Hamilton by her first name only, she said she would not answer any questions unless she were addressed as "Miss Hamilton". When she persisted in her demand to be addressed in this manner, the judge held her in [[contempt of court]] and sentenced her to five days in jail and a $50 fine.

After serving the five days, she refused to pay the fine and was allowed out on bond to appeal the contempt conviction. After the [[Alabama Supreme Court]] denied her appeal, the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] asked the Supreme Court to review Hamilton's case. Her lawyers argued that the first-name form of address used by the prosecutor was part of a "racial caste system" that violated Hamilton's [[equal protection]] guarantees.&lt;ref name=LSAT /&gt;

== Opinion of the Court ==
In a 6–3 ''[[per curiam]]'' opinion, the Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] (agreed to consider the case) and, without hearing any oral arguments, found in Hamilton's favor, reversing the judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court. In support of its summary decision, the court cited its 1963 ruling in ''Johnson v. Virginia'', in which it had unanimously held that "a State may not require racial segregation in a courtroom".&lt;ref&gt;''Johnson v. Virginia'', {{ussc|373|61|1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associate Justices [[Tom C. Clark]], [[John M. Harlan II]], and [[Byron White]] dissented from the majority's decision to grant certiorari.

{{Merge|Recursive data type|date=January 2018}}

In [[type theory]], a system has '''inductive types''' if it has facilities for creating a new type along with constants and functions that create terms of that type.  The feature serves a role similar to [[data structure]]s in a programming language and allows a type theory to add concepts like [[number]]s, [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]], and [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]].  As the name suggests, inductive types can be self-referential, but usually only in a way that permits [[structural recursion]].

The standard example is encoding the [[natural number]]s using [[Peano axioms|Peano's encoding]].
&lt;source lang="coq"&gt;
 Inductive nat : Type :=
   | 0 : nat
   | S : nat -&gt; nat.
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, a natural number is created either from the constant "0" or by applying the function "S" to another natural number.  "S" is the [[successor function]] which represents adding 1 to a number.  Thus, "0" is zero, "S 0" is one, "S (S 0)" is two, "S (S (S 0))" is three, and so on.

Since their introduction, inductive types have been extended to encode more and more structures, while still being [[Impredicative|predicative]] and supporting structural recursion.

== Elimination ==

Inductive types usually come with a function to prove properties about them.  Thus, "nat" may come with:
&lt;source lang="coq"&gt;
 nat_elim : (forall P : nat -&gt; Prop, (P 0) -&gt; (forall n, P n -&gt; P (S n)) -&gt; (forall n, P n)).
&lt;/source&gt;
This is the expected function for structural recursion for the type "nat".

== Implementations ==

=== W- and M-types ===

W-types are [[Well-founded relation|well-founded]] types in [[intuitionistic type theory]] (ITT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://intuitionistic.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/martin-lof-tt.pdf|title=Intuitionistic type theory|last=Martin-Löf|first=Per|date=1984|publisher=Bibliopolis|others=Sambin, Giovanni|isbn=8870881059|location=Napoli|oclc=12731401}}&lt;/ref&gt; They generalize natural numbers, lists, binary trees, and other "tree-shaped" data types. Let {{var|U}} be a [[Universe (mathematics)#In type theory|universe of types]]. Given a type {{var|A}} : {{var|U}} and a [[Dependent type|dependent family]] {{var|B}} : {{var|A}} → {{var|U}}, one can form a W-type &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{W}_{(a:A)} B(a)&lt;/math&gt;. The type {{var|A}} may be thought of as "labels" for the (potentially infinitely many) constructors of the inductive type being defined, whereas {{var|B}} indicates the (potentially infinite) [[arity]] of each constructor. W-types (resp. M-types) may also be understood as well-founded (resp. non-well-founded) trees with nodes labeled by elements {{var|a}} : {{var|A}} and where the node labeled by {{var|a}} has {{var|B}}({{var|a}})-many subtrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Ahrens|first=Benedikt|last2=Capriotti|first2=Paolo|last3=Spadotti|first3=Régis|date=2015-04-12|title=Non-wellfounded trees in Homotopy Type Theory|eprint=1504.02949|class=cs.LO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let '''0''', '''1''', '''2''', etc. be finite types with inhabitants 1&lt;sub&gt;'''1'''&lt;/sub&gt; : '''1''', 1&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt;, 2&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt;:'''2''', etc. One may define the natural numbers as the W-type

:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\mathbb{N}:= \mathsf{W}_{(x:\mathbf{2})} f(x)
&lt;/math&gt;

with {{var|f}} : '''2''' → {{var|U}} is defined by {{var|f}}(1&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''0''' (representing the constructor for zero, which takes no arguments), and {{var|f}}(2&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''1''' (representing the successor function, which takes one argument).

One may define lists over a type {{var|A}} : {{var|U}} as &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{List}(A) := \mathsf{W}_{(x:\mathbf{1}+A)} f(x)&lt;/math&gt; where
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  f(\operatorname{inl}(1_{\mathbf{1}})) &amp;= \mathbf{0} \\
  f(\operatorname{inr}(a)) &amp;= \mathbf{1}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
and 1&lt;sub&gt;'''1'''&lt;/sub&gt; is the sole inhabitant of '''1'''. The value of &lt;math&gt;f(\operatorname{inl}(1_{\mathbf{1}}))&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the constructor for the empty list, whereas the value of &lt;math&gt;f(\operatorname{inr}(a))&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the constructor that appends {{var|a}} to the beginning of another list.

The constructor for elements of a generic W-type &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{W}_{(a:A)} B(a)&lt;/math&gt; has type
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\mathsf{sup}:\prod_{(a:A)}\Big(B(a)\to\mathsf{W}_{(x:A)}B(x)\Big)\to \mathsf{W}_{(x:A)} B(x).
&lt;/math&gt;
We can also write this rule in the style of a [[natural deduction]] proof,
:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;
\frac{
  a:A
  \qquad
  f:B(a)\to\mathsf{W}_{a:A}B(a)
}{
  \mathsf{sup}(a,f):\mathsf{W}_{a:A}B(a)
}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The elimination rule for W-types works similarly to [[structural induction]] on trees. If, whenever a property (under the [[Curry–Howard correspondence|propositions-as-types]] interpretation) {{var|C}} : {{var|A}} → {{var|U}} holds for all subtrees of a given tree it also holds for that tree, then it holds for all trees.

:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;
\frac{
  w:\mathsf{W}_{a:A}B(a)
  \qquad
  a:A, \; f:B(a)\to\mathsf{W}_{a:A}B(a), \;
  c:\prod_{b:B(a)} C(f(b))
  \;\vdash\; h(a,f,c):C(\mathsf{sup}(a,f))
}{
  \mathsf{elim}(w, h):C(w)
}
&lt;/math&gt;

In extensional type theories, W-types (resp. M-types) can be defined up to [[isomorphism]] as [[initial algebra]]s (resp. final coalgebras) for [[polynomial functor]]s. In this case, the property of initiality (res. finality) corresponds directly to the appropriate induction principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dybjer|first=Peter|title=Representing inductively defined sets by wellorderings in Martin-Löf's type theory|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3975(96)00145-4|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=176|issue=1–2|pages=329–335|doi=10.1016/s0304-3975(96)00145-4|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In intensional type theories with the [[univalence axiom]], this correspondence holds up to homotopy (propositional equality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Awodey|first=Steve|last2=Gambino|first2=Nicola|last3=Sojakova|first3=Kristina|date=2012-01-18|title=Inductive types in homotopy type theory|eprint=1201.3898|class=math.LO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Ahrens|first=Benedikt|last2=Capriotti|first2=Paolo|last3=Spadotti|first3=Régis|date=2015-04-12|title=Non-wellfounded trees in Homotopy Type Theory|eprint=1504.02949|class=cs.LO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Awodey|first=Steve|last2=Gambino|first2=Nicola|last3=Sojakova|first3=Kristina|date=2015-04-21|title=Homotopy-initial algebras in type theory|eprint=1504.05531 |class=math.LO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M-types are [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] to W-types, they represent [[Coinduction|coinductive]] (potentially infinite) data such as [[Stream (computer science)|streams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van den Berg|first=Benno|last2=Marchi|first2=Federico De|title=Non-well-founded trees in categories|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apal.2006.12.001|journal=Annals of Pure and Applied Logic|volume=146|issue=1|pages=40–59|doi=10.1016/j.apal.2006.12.001|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; M-types can be derived from W-types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Michael|last2=Altenkirch|first2=Thorsten|last3=Ghani|first3=Neil|title=Containers: Constructing strictly positive types|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2005.06.002|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=342|issue=1|pages=3–27|doi=10.1016/j.tcs.2005.06.002|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mutually inductive definitions ===

This technique allows ''some'' definitions of multiple types that depend on each other. For example, defining two [[parity (mathematics)|parity]] predicates on [[natural number]]s using two mutually inductive types in [[Coq]]:

&lt;source lang="coq"&gt;
Inductive even : nat -&gt; Prop :=
  | zero_is_even : even O
  | S_of_odd_is_even : (forall n:nat, odd n -&gt; even (S n))
with odd : nat -&gt; Prop :=
  | S_of_even_is_odd : (forall n:nat, even n -&gt; odd (S n)).
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Induction-recursion ===

[[Induction-recursion (type theory)|Induction-recursion]] started as a study into the limits of ITT.  Once found, the limits were turned into rules that allowed defining new inductive types.  These types could depend upon a function and the function on the type, as long as both were defined simultaneously.

[[Universe type]]s can be defined using induction-recursion.

=== Induction-induction ===

[[Induction-induction]] allows definition of a type and a family of types at the same time.  So, a type {{mvar|A}} and a family of types &lt;math&gt;B : A \to Type&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Higher inductive types ===

This is a current research area in [[Homotopy type theory|Homotopy Type Theory]] (HoTT).  HoTT differs from ITT by its identity type (equality).  Higher inductive types not only define a new type with constants and functions that create the type, but also new instances of the identity type that relate them.

A simple example is the {{mvar|circle}} type, which is defined with two constructors, a basepoint;

:{{math|''base'' : ''circle''}}

and a loop;

:{{math|1=''loop'' : ''base'' = ''base''.}}

The existence of a new constructor for the identity type makes {{mvar|circle}} a higher inductive type.

{{wpspace}}

'''Interstellar travel''' is the term used for [[Human spaceflight|crewed]] or uncrewed travel between [[star]]s or [[planetary system]]s. Interstellar travel will be much more difficult than [[interplanetary spaceflight]]; the distances between the [[planet]]s in the [[Solar System]] are less than 30 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU)—whereas the distances between stars are typically hundreds of thousands of AU, and usually expressed in [[light-year]]s. Because of the vastness of those distances, interstellar travel would require a high percentage of the [[speed of light]]; huge travel time, lasting from decades to millennia or longer; or a combination of both.

The speeds required for interstellar travel in a human lifetime far exceed what current methods of [[spacecraft propulsion]] can provide. Even with a hypothetically perfectly efficient propulsion system, the [[kinetic energy]] corresponding to those speeds is enormous by today's standards of [[energy development]]. Moreover, collisions by the spacecraft with [[cosmic dust]] and gas can produce very dangerous effects both to passengers and the spacecraft itself.

A number of strategies have been proposed to deal with these problems, ranging from giant arks that would carry entire societies and ecosystems, to microscopic [[space probe]]s. Many different [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems have been proposed to give spacecraft the required speeds, including [[nuclear propulsion]], [[beam-powered propulsion]], and methods based on speculative physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis-space.com/what-we-do/advocacy/interstellar-travel|title=Interstellar Travel|website=www.bis-space.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For both crewed and uncrewed interstellar travel, considerable technological and economic challenges need to be met. Even the most optimistic views about interstellar travel see it as only being feasible decades from now. However, in spite of the challenges, if or when interstellar travel is realised, a wide range of scientific benefits is expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=I. A.|title=The Astronomical, Astrobiological and Planetary Science Case for Interstellar Spaceflight|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|date=2009|volume=62|pages=415–421|arxiv=1008.4893|bibcode = 2009JBIS...62..415C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most interstellar travel concepts require a developed space logistics system capable of moving millions of tons to a construction / operating location, and most would require gigawatt-scale power for construction or power (such as [[Starwisp|Star Wisp]] or [[Solar sail|Light Sail]] type concepts). Such a system could grow organically if [[space-based solar power]] became a significant component of Earth's energy mix. Consumer demand for a multi-terawatt system would automatically create the necessary multi-million ton/year logistical system.&lt;ref&gt;Conclusion of the 2016 Tennessee Valley Interstellar Workshop Space Solar Power Working Track run by Peter Garretson &amp; Robert Kennedy.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==

=== Interstellar distances ===
Distances between the planets in the Solar System are often measured in astronomical units (AU), defined as the average distance between the Sun and Earth, some {{convert|1.5E8|km|e6mi|sp=us|abbr=off}}. [[Venus]], the closest other planet to Earth is (at closest approach) 0.28 AU away. [[Neptune]], the farthest planet from the Sun, is 29.8 AU away. As of January 2018, [[Voyager&amp;nbsp;1]], the farthest man-made object from Earth, is 141.5 AU away.&lt;ref name="voyager"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/|title=Where are the Voyagers – NASA Voyager|last=JPL.NASA.GOV|website=voyager.jpl.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closest known star, [[Proxima Centauri]], is approximately {{convert|4.243|ly|AU|0|disp=output only}} away, or over 9,000 times farther away than Neptune.
&lt;!--
1 A.U. = 149,597,870,700 meters,
1 light-year = 9,460,730,472,580,800 meters or 63241.077 AU,
Venus perihelion = 0.7184 AU
Neptune perihelion = 29.809946 AU
Voyager 1 distance (2014/sep) = 129.18 AU
Proxima = 4.243 ± 0.002 light years away.

Because of this, distances between stars are usually expressed in [[light-year]]s, defined as the distance that a [[light]] [[photon]] travels in a year. Light in a vacuum travels around {{convert|300000|km|mi|-3}} per second, so this is some {{convert|{{convert|1|ly|Pm|3|disp=number}}e12|km|e12mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} or {{convert|1|ly|AU|0}} in a year. Proxima Centauri is 4.243 light-years away.

Another way of understanding the vastness of interstellar distances is by scaling: One of the closest stars to the Sun, [[Alpha Centauri A]] (a Sun-like star), can be pictured by scaling down the [[astronomical unit|Earth–Sun distance]] to {{convert|1|m|ft|2|spell=in|sp=us}}. On this scale, the distance to Alpha Centauri A would be {{convert|276|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}}&lt;!--Using 4.37 ly from Alpha Centauri page--&gt;.

The fastest outward-bound spacecraft yet sent, [[Voyager 1#Interstellar mission|Voyager 1]], has covered 1/600 of a light-year in 30 years and is currently moving at 1/18,000 the speed of light. At this rate, a journey to Proxima Centauri would take 80,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/scales.html | title= A Look at the Scaling | website= nasa.gov | publisher= NASA Glenn Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Required energy ===
A significant factor contributing to the difficulty is the energy that must be supplied to obtain a reasonable travel time. A lower bound for the required energy is the [[kinetic energy]] &lt;math&gt;K = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the final mass. If [[deceleration]] on arrival is desired and cannot be achieved by any means other than the engines of the ship, then the lower bound for the required energy is doubled to &lt;math&gt;mv^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |last=Millis |first=Marc G. |year=2011 |title=Energy, incessant obsolescence, and the first interstellar missions |journal=&lt;!-- --&gt; |volume=&lt;!-- --&gt; |issue=&lt;!-- --&gt; |eprint=1101.1066 |class=physics.gen-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The velocity for a manned round trip of a few decades to even the nearest star is several thousand times greater than those of present space vehicles. This means that due to the &lt;math&gt;v^2&lt;/math&gt; term in the kinetic energy formula, millions of times as much energy is required.

This energy has to be generated onboard from stored fuel, harvested from the interstellar medium, or projected over immense distances.

=== Interstellar medium ===
A knowledge of the properties of the [[interstellar medium|interstellar gas and dust]] through which the vehicle must pass is essential for the design of any interstellar space mission.&lt;ref name="ism" /&gt; A major issue with traveling at extremely high speeds is that interstellar dust may cause considerable damage to the craft, due to the high relative speeds and large kinetic energies involved. Various shielding methods to mitigate this problem have been proposed.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite conference | url= http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/637131main_radiation%20shielding_symposium_r1.pdf | title= Active Radiation Shielding Utilizing High Temperature Superconductors | author= Westover, Shayne | conference= NIAC Symposium | date= 27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger objects (such as macroscopic dust grains) are far less common, but would be much more destructive. The risks of impacting such objects, and methods of mitigating these risks, have been discussed in the literature, but many unknowns remain&lt;ref name="HGarrett"&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://www.kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/systems2012/presentations/garrett.pdf | title= There and Back Again: A Layman’s Guide to Ultra-Reliability for Interstellar Missions | author= Garrett, Henry | date= 30 July 2012 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140508062130/http://www.kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/systems2012/presentations/garrett.pdf | archivedate= 8 May 2014 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, owing to the inhomogeneous distribution of interstellar matter around the Sun, will depend on direction travelled.&lt;ref name=ism&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=I. A.|title=Project Icarus: A review of local interstellar medium properties of relevance for space missions to the nearest stars|journal=Acta Astronautica|date=2011|volume=68|issue=7–8|pages=691–699|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2010.10.016|arxiv=1010.4823|bibcode = 2011AcAau..68..691C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a high density interstellar medium may cause difficulties for many interstellar travel concepts, [[Bussard ramjet|interstellar ramjets]], and some proposed concepts for decelerating interstellar spacecraft, would actually benefit from a denser interstellar medium.&lt;ref name="ism" /&gt;

=== Hazards ===
The crew of an interstellar ship would face several significant hazards, including the psychological effects of long-term [[solitude|isolation]], the effects of exposure to [[ionizing radiation]], and the physiological effects of [[weightlessness]] to the muscles, joints, bones, immune system, and eyes. There also exists the risk of impact by [[micrometeoroid]]s and other [[space debris]]. These risks represent challenges that have yet to be overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrestrial and Extraterrestrial Space Dangers: Outer Space Perils|last= Gibson|first=Dirk|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dvYADgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=risks%20of%20space%20travel&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=risks%20of%20space%20travel&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wait calculation ===
It has been argued that an interstellar mission that cannot be completed within 50 years should not be started at all. Instead, assuming that a civilization is still on an increasing curve of propulsion system velocity and not yet having reached the limit, the resources should be invested in designing a better propulsion system. This is because a slow spacecraft would probably be passed by another mission sent later with more advanced propulsion (the incessant obsolescence postulate).&lt;ref name="Bob Forward 1996" /&gt; On the other hand, Andrew Kennedy has shown that if one calculates the journey time to a given destination as the rate of travel speed derived from growth (even exponential growth) increases, there is a clear minimum in the total time to that destination from now.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Interstellar Travel: The Wait Calculation and the Incentive Trap of Progress |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=59 |number=7 |date=July 2006|pages=239–246 |last= Kennedy |first=Andrew |url= http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2006.59.239 &lt;!--|id=Refcode 2006.59.239--&gt;|bibcode = 2006JBIS...59..239K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Voyages undertaken before the minimum will be overtaken by those that leave at the minimum, whereas voyages that leave after the minimum will never overtake those that left at the minimum.

Existing and near-term astronomical technology is capable of finding planetary systems around these objects, increasing their potential for exploration

== Proposed methods ==

=== Slow, uncrewed probes ===
{{Main|Interstellar probe}}
Slow interstellar missions based on current and near-future propulsion technologies are associated with trip times starting from about one hundred years to thousands of years. These missions consist of sending a robotic probe to a nearby star for exploration, similar to interplanetary probes such as used in the [[Voyager program]].&lt;ref name="National Aeronautics and Space Administration"&gt;{{cite book|title=Voyager|date=1977|publisher=ERIC Clearing House|location=Louisiana State University|page=12|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=76390b8e-3776-42f2-87d0-14f9ce6435e2%40sessionmgr4001&amp;hid=4210&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=lalu.2943532&amp;db=cat00252a|accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; By taking along no crew, the cost and complexity of the mission is significantly reduced although technology lifetime is still a significant issue next to obtaining a reasonable speed of travel. Proposed concepts include [[Project Daedalus]], [[Project Icarus (interstellar)|Project Icarus]], [[Project Dragonfly (space study)|Project Dragonfly]], [[Project Longshot]],&lt;ref name="centauri-dreams.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=31478|title=Project Dragonfly: The case for small, laser-propelled, distributed probes|work=Centauri Dreams|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently [[Breakthrough Starshot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161003-the-myths-and-reality-about-interstellar-travel|title=The myths and reality about interstellar travel|last=Nogrady|first=Bianca|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fast, uncrewed probes ===
{{Main|Interstellar probe}}

==== Nanoprobes ====
Near-lightspeed nano spacecraft might be possible within the near future built on existing microchip technology with a newly developed nanoscale thruster. Researchers at the [[University of Michigan]] are developing thrusters that use nanoparticles as propellant. Their technology is called "nanoparticle field extraction thruster", or [[Nano-particle field extraction thruster|nanoFET]]. These devices act like small particle accelerators shooting conductive nanoparticles out into space.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. Wilson. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31665236/ns/technology_and_science-innovation/t/near-lightspeed-nano-spacecraft-might-be-close/#.T9v9Dz5Yu44 Near-lightspeed nano spacecraft might be close]. ''msnbc.msn.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michio Kaku]], a theoretical physicist, has suggested that clouds of "smart dust" be sent to the stars, which may become possible with advances in [[nanotechnology]]. Kaku also notes that a large number of nanoprobes would need to be sent due to the vulnerability of very small probes to be easily deflected by magnetic fields, micrometeorites and other dangers to ensure the chances that at least one nanoprobe will survive the journey and reach the destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Physics of the Impossible|last = Kaku|first = Michio|publisher =Anchor Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the light weight of these probes, it would take much less energy to accelerate them. With onboard solar cells, they could continually accelerate using solar power. One can envision a day when a fleet of millions or even billions of these particles swarm to distant stars at nearly the speed of light and relay signals back to Earth through a vast interstellar communication network.

As a near-term solution, small, laser-propelled interstellar probes, based on current CubeSat technology were proposed in the context of [[Project Dragonfly (space study)|Project Dragonfly]].&lt;ref name="centauri-dreams.org" /&gt;

=== Slow, manned missions ===
In crewed missions, the duration of a slow interstellar journey presents a major obstacle and existing concepts deal with this problem in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hein|first=A. M.|title=How Will Humans Fly to the Stars?|url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=22561|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be distinguished by the "state" in which humans are transported on-board of the spacecraft.

==== Generation ships ====
{{Main|Generation ship}}
A [[generation ship]] (or '''world ship''') is a type of [[interstellar ark]] in which the crew that arrives at the destination is descended from those who started the journey. Generation ships are not currently feasible because of the difficulty of constructing a ship of the enormous required scale and the great biological and sociological problems that life aboard such a ship raises.&lt;!---So? nothing else in this article is, either---&gt;&lt;ref name="Hein 2012 119–133"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hein|first=A.

==== Suspended animation ====
{{Main|Sleeper ship}}

Scientists and writers have postulated various techniques for [[suspended animation]]. These include human [[hibernation]] and [[cryonics|cryonic preservation]]. Although neither is currently practical, they offer the possibility of [[sleeper ship]]s in which the passengers lie inert for the long duration of the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Various articles on hibernation|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|date=2006|volume=59|pages=81–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Frozen embryos ====
{{Main|Embryo colonization}}
A [[robotic]] interstellar mission carrying some number of frozen early stage human [[embryo]]s is another theoretical possibility. This method of [[space colonization]] requires, among other things, the development of an [[artificial uterus]], the prior detection of a habitable [[terrestrial planet]], and advances in the field of fully autonomous [[robotics|mobile robots]] and educational robots that would replace human parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crowl|first=A.|author2=Hunt, J. |author3=Hein, A.M. |title=Embryo Space Colonisation to Overcome the Interstellar Time Distance Bottleneck|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|date=2012|volume=65|pages=283–285|url=http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2012.65.283|bibcode = 2012JBIS...65..283C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Island hopping through interstellar space ===
Interstellar space is not completely empty; it contains trillions of icy bodies ranging from small asteroids ([[Oort cloud]]) to possible [[rogue planet]]s. There may be ways to take advantage of these resources for a good part of an interstellar trip, slowly hopping from body to body or setting up waystations along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=21719|title=‘Island-Hopping’ to the Stars|work=Centauri Dreams|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fast missions ===
If a spaceship could average 10&amp;nbsp;percent of light speed (and decelerate at the destination, for manned missions), this would be enough to reach [[Proxima Centauri]] in forty years. Several propulsion concepts have been proposed &lt;ref name=crawist&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=I. A.| date= 1990|title=Interstellar Travel: A Review for Astronomers|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=31|pages=377–400|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1990QJRAS..31..377C&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf|bibcode=1990QJRAS..31..377C}}&lt;/ref&gt; that might be eventually developed to accomplish this (see [[Interstellar travel#Propulsion|§ Propulsion]] below), but none of them are ready for near-term (few decades) developments at acceptable cost.

==== Time dilation ====
{{Main|Time dilation}}

Assuming faster-than-light travel is impossible, one might conclude that a human can never make a round-trip farther from Earth than 20 light years if the traveler is active between the ages of 20 and 60. A traveler would never be able to reach more than the very few star systems that exist within the limit of 20 light years from Earth. This, however, fails to take into account relativistic [[time dilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parkinson|first1=Bradford W.|last2=Spilker|first2=James J. Jr.|last3=Axelrad|first3=Penina|last4=Enge|first4=Per|title=18.2.2.1Time Dilation|date=2014|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|isbn=978-1-56347-106-3|url=http://app.knovel.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/hotlink/pdf/rcid:kpGPSVTA03/id:kt00C9LNA2/global-positioning-system/time-dilation?kpromoter=federation.|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clocks aboard an interstellar ship would run slower than Earth clocks, so if a ship's engines were capable of continuously generating around 1&amp;nbsp;g of acceleration (which is comfortable for humans), the ship could reach almost anywhere in the galaxy and return to Earth within 40 years ship-time (see diagram). Upon return, there would be a difference between the time elapsed on the astronaut's ship and the time elapsed on Earth.

For example, a spaceship could travel to a star 32 light-years away, initially accelerating at a constant 1.03g (i.e. 10.1&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for 1.32 years (ship time), then stopping its engines and coasting for the next 17.3 years (ship time) at a constant speed, then decelerating again for 1.32 ship-years, and coming to a stop at the destination. After a short visit, the astronaut could return to Earth the same way. After the full round-trip, the clocks on board the ship show that 40 years have passed, but according to those on Earth, the ship comes back 76 years after launch.

From the viewpoint of the astronaut, onboard clocks seem to be running normally. The star ahead seems to be approaching at a speed of 0.87 light years per ship-year. The universe would appear contracted along the direction of travel to half the size it had when the ship was at rest; the distance between that star and the Sun would seem to be 16 light years as measured by the astronaut.

At higher speeds, the time on board will run even slower, so the astronaut could travel to the center of the [[Milky Way]] (30,000 light years from Earth) and back in 40 years ship-time. But the speed according to Earth clocks will always be less than 1 light year per Earth year, so, when back home, the astronaut will find that more than 60 thousand years will have passed on Earth.

==== Constant acceleration ====
{{See also|Space travel using constant acceleration}}

[[File:Roundtriptimes.png|thumb|upright=1.4|This plot shows a ship capable of 1-[[Gravitational acceleration|g]] (10&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or about 1.0 ly/y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) "felt" or proper-acceleration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Clock paradox III | url= http://www.eftaylor.com/pub/spacetime/STP1stEdExercP81to100.pdf}} {{cite book | author1= Taylor, Edwin F. | author2= Wheeler, John Archibald | date= 1966 | title= Spacetime Physics | publisher= W.H. Freeman, San Francisco | isbn= 0-7167-0336-X | chapter= Chapter 1 Exercise 51 | pages= 97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; can go far, except for the problem of accelerating on-board propellant.]]

Regardless of how it is achieved, a propulsion system that could produce acceleration continuously from departure to arrival would be the fastest method of travel. A constant acceleration journey is one where the propulsion system accelerates the ship at a constant rate for the first half of the journey, and then decelerates for the second half, so that it arrives at the destination stationary relative to where it began.  If this were performed with an acceleration similar to that experienced at the Earth's surface, it would have the added advantage of producing artificial "gravity" for the crew. Supplying the energy required, however, would be prohibitively expensive with current technology.&lt;ref&gt;Crowell, Benjamin (2011), Light and Matter Section 4.3&lt;/ref&gt;

From the perspective of a planetary observer, the ship will appear to accelerate steadily at first, but then more gradually as it approaches the speed of light (which it cannot exceed). It will undergo [[hyperbolic motion (relativity)|hyperbolic motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Yagasaki|first1 = Kazuyuki|title = Invariant Manifolds And Control Of Hyperbolic Trajectories On Infinite- Or Finite-Time Intervals|journal = Dynamical Systems: an International Journal|date = 2008|volume = 23|issue = 3|pages = 309–331|doi = 10.1080/14689360802263571|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?sid=d00eb956-7105-4cbf-9f16-c9099d40da11%40sessionmgr4001&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%253fdirect%253dtrue%2526db%253dcph%2526AN%253d34168097%2526site%253deds-live%2526scope%253dsite%2526profile%253deds-main&amp;hid=4111&amp;vid=0&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=34168097&amp;db=cph|accessdate = 27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship will be close to the speed of light after about a year of accelerating and remain at that speed until it brakes for the end of the journey.

From the perspective of an onboard observer, the crew will feel a [[gravitational field]] opposite the engine's acceleration, and the universe ahead will appear to fall in that field, undergoing hyperbolic motion. As part of this, distances between objects in the direction of the ship's motion will gradually contract until the ship begins to decelerate, at which time an onboard observer's experience of the gravitational field will be reversed.

When the ship reaches its destination, if it were to exchange a message with its origin planet, it would find that less time had elapsed on board than had elapsed for the planetary observer, due to [[time dilation]] and [[length contraction]].

The result is an impressively fast journey for the crew.

== Propulsion ==

=== Rocket concepts ===
All rocket concepts are limited by the [[rocket equation]], which sets the characteristic velocity available as a function of exhaust velocity and mass ratio, the ratio of initial (''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, including fuel) to final (''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, fuel depleted) mass.

Very high [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]], the ratio of thrust to total vehicle mass, is required to reach interstellar targets within sub-century time-frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= VISTA – A Vehicle for Interplanetary Space Transport Application Powered by Inertial Confinement Fusion | author= Orth, C. D. | date= 16 May 2003 | publisher= Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | url= https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/318478.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some heat transfer is inevitable and a tremendous heating load must be adequately handled.

Thus, for interstellar rocket concepts of all technologies, a key engineering problem (seldom explicitly discussed) is limiting the heat transfer from the exhaust stream back into the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= The Exploration of Space | author= Clarke, Arthur C. | publisher= New York: Harper | date= 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ion engine ====
A type of electric propulsion, spacecraft such as [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]] use an [[ion engine]]. In an ion engine, electric power is used to create charged particles of the propellant, usually the gas xenon, and accelerate them to extremely high velocities. The exhaust velocity of conventional rockets is limited by the chemical energy stored in the fuel’s molecular bonds, which limits the thrust to about 5&amp;nbsp;km/s. They produce a high thrust (about 10⁶ N), but they have a low specific impulse, and that limits their top speed. By contrast, ion engines have low force, but the top speed in principle is limited only by the electrical power available on the spacecraft and on the gas ions being accelerated. The exhaust speed of the charged particles range from 15&amp;nbsp;km/s to 35&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref name="http://www.iflscience.com"&gt;{{citation | url= http://www.iflscience.com/space/dawn-new-era-revolutionary-ion-engine-took-spacecraft-ceres | title= Dawn Of A New Era: The Revolutionary Ion Engine That Took Spacecraft To Ceres}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nuclear fission powered ====

===== Fission-electric =====
Nuclear-electric or plasma engines, operating for long periods at low thrust and powered by fission reactors, have the potential to reach speeds much greater than chemically powered vehicles or nuclear-thermal rockets. Such vehicles probably have the potential to power solar system exploration with reasonable trip times within the current century. Because of their low-thrust propulsion, they would be limited to off-planet, deep-space operation. [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion]] powered by a portable power-source, say a [[nuclear reactor]], producing only small accelerations, would take centuries to reach for example 15% of the [[velocity of light]], thus unsuitable for interstellar flight during a single human lifetime.&lt;ref name="scholar.googleusercontent.com"&gt;{{citation|url=http://daedalus-zvezdolet.narod.ru/doceng/07eng.doc |title=Project Daedalus: The Propulsion System Part 1; Theoretical considerations and calculations. 2.

===== Fission-fragment =====
[[Fission-fragment rocket]]s use [[nuclear fission]] to create high-speed jets of fission fragments, which are ejected at speeds of up to {{convert|12,000|km/s|mi/s|abbr=on}}. With fission, the energy output is approximately 0.1% of the total mass-energy of the reactor fuel and limits the effective exhaust velocity to about 5% of the velocity of light. For maximum velocity, the reaction mass should optimally consist of fission products, the "ash" of the primary energy source, so no extra reaction mass need be bookkept in the mass ratio.

===== Nuclear pulse =====
{{Main|Nuclear pulse propulsion}}
[[File:Modern Pulsed Fission Propulsion Concept.jpg|thumb|Modern Pulsed Fission Propulsion Concept.]]Based on work in the late 1950s to the early 1960s, it has been technically possible to build spaceships with [[nuclear pulse propulsion]] engines, i.e. driven by a series of nuclear explosions. This propulsion system contains the prospect of very high [[specific impulse]] (space travel's equivalent of fuel economy) and high [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]].&lt;ref name="GeneralDynamics1964NuclearPulseVehicleCondensed"&gt;{{cite web

[[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] team member [[Freeman Dyson]] proposed in 1968 an interstellar spacecraft using nuclear pulse propulsion that used pure [[deuterium fusion]] detonations with a very high fuel-[[burnup]] fraction. He computed an exhaust velocity of 15,000&amp;nbsp;km/s and a 100,000-tonne space vehicle able to achieve a 20,000&amp;nbsp;km/s [[delta-v]] allowing a flight-time to [[Alpha Centauri]] of 130 years.&lt;ref name="Interstellar Transport"&gt;{{cite journal

A nuclear pulse drive starship powered by fusion-antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion units would be similarly in the 10% range and pure matter-antimatter annihilation rockets would be theoretically capable of obtaining a velocity between 50% to 80% of the speed of light. In each case saving fuel for slowing down halves the maximum speed. The concept of using a [[magnetic sail]] to decelerate the spacecraft as it approaches its destination has been discussed as an alternative to using propellant, this would allow the ship to travel near the maximum theoretical velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Use of Mini-Mag Orion and superconducting coils for near-term interstellar transportation | author1= Lenard, Roger X. | author2= Andrews, Dana G. | journal= Acta Astronautica | date= June 2007 | volume= 61 | issue= 1–6 | url= http://www.space-nation.org/images/a/a1/Mini-Mag_Orion_and_superconducting_coils_for_near-term_interstellar_transportation_LenardAndrews.pdf | doi= 10.1016/j.actaastro.2007.01.052 | pages=450–458|bibcode = 2007AcAau..61..450L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative designs utilizing similar principles include [[Project Longshot]], [[Project Daedalus]], and [[Mini-Mag Orion]]. The principle of external nuclear pulse propulsion to maximize survivable power has remained common among serious concepts for interstellar flight without external power beaming and for very high-performance interplanetary flight.

In the 1970s the Nuclear Pulse Propulsion concept further was refined by [[Project Daedalus]] by use of externally triggered [[inertial confinement fusion]], in this case producing fusion explosions via compressing fusion fuel pellets with high-powered electron beams. Since then, [[laser]]s, [[ion beam]]s, [[neutral particle beam]]s and hyper-kinetic projectiles have been suggested to produce nuclear pulses for propulsion purposes.&lt;ref name="The Release of Thermonuclear Energy by Inertial Confinement"&gt;{{cite book

A current impediment to the development of ''any'' nuclear-explosion-powered spacecraft is the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty]], which includes a prohibition on the detonation of any nuclear devices (even non-weapon based) in outer space. This treaty would, therefore, need to be renegotiated, although a project on the scale of an interstellar mission using currently foreseeable technology would probably require international cooperation on at least the scale of the [[International Space Station]].

Another issue to be considered, would be the [[g-force]]s imparted to a rapidly accelerated spacecraft, cargo, and passengers inside (see [[Inertia negation]]).

==== Nuclear fusion rockets ====
[[Fusion rocket]] starships, powered by [[nuclear fusion]] reactions, should conceivably be able to reach speeds of the order of 10% of that of light, based on energy considerations alone. In theory, a large number of stages could push a vehicle arbitrarily close to the speed of light.&lt;ref name="L.D. Jaffe 1963, pp. 49-58" /&gt; These would "burn" such light element fuels as deuterium, tritium, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B, and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li. Because fusion yields about 0.3–0.9% of the mass of the nuclear fuel as released energy, it is energetically more favorable than fission, which releases &lt;0.1% of the fuel's mass-energy. The maximum exhaust velocities potentially energetically available are correspondingly higher than for fission, typically 4–10% of c. However, the most easily achievable fusion reactions release a large fraction of their energy as high-energy neutrons, which are a significant source of energy loss. Thus, although these concepts seem to offer the best (nearest-term) prospects for travel to the nearest stars within a (long) human lifetime, they still involve massive technological and engineering difficulties, which may turn out to be intractable for decades or centuries.

[[File:Daedalus ship.png|thumb|Daedalus interstellar vehicle.]]Early studies include [[Project Daedalus]], performed by the [[British Interplanetary Society]] in 1973–1978, and [[Project Longshot]], a student project sponsored by [[NASA]] and the [[US Naval Academy]], completed in 1988. Another fairly detailed vehicle system, "Discovery II",&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110610051632/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2005/TM-2005-213559.pdf PDF] C. R. Williams et al., 'Realizing "2001: A Space Odyssey": Piloted Spherical Torus Nuclear Fusion Propulsion', 2001, 52 pages, NASA Glenn Research Center&lt;/ref&gt; designed and optimized for crewed Solar System exploration, based on the D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He reaction but using hydrogen as reaction mass, has been described by a team from NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]]. It achieves characteristic velocities of &gt;300&amp;nbsp;km/s with an acceleration of ~1.7•10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; ''g'', with a ship initial mass of ~1700 metric tons, and payload fraction above 10%. Although these are still far short of the requirements for interstellar travel on human timescales, the study seems to represent a reasonable benchmark towards what may be approachable within several decades, which is not impossibly beyond the current state-of-the-art. Based on the concept's 2.2% [[burnup]] fraction it could achieve a pure fusion product exhaust velocity of ~3,000&amp;nbsp;km/s.

==== Antimatter rockets ====
{{Main|Antimatter rocket}}
{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
An [[antimatter rocket]] would have a far higher energy density and specific impulse than any other proposed class of rocket.&lt;ref name="crawist" /&gt; If energy resources and efficient production methods are found to make [[antimatter]] in the quantities required and store&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.web.cern.ch/about/engineering/storing-antimatter|title=Storing antimatter - CERN|website=home.web.cern.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2011/06/05/alpha-quarter-hour/|title=ALPHA Stores Antimatter Atoms Over a Quarter of an Hour – and Still Counting - Berkeley Lab|date=5 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it safely, it would be theoretically possible to reach speeds of several tens of percent that of light.&lt;ref name="crawist" /&gt; Whether antimatter propulsion could lead to the higher speeds (&gt;90% that of light) at which relativistic [[time dilation]] would become more noticeable, thus making time pass at a slower rate for the travelers as perceived by an outside observer, is doubtful owing to the large quantity of antimatter that would be required.&lt;ref name="crawist" /&gt;

Speculating that production and storage of antimatter should become feasible, two further issues need to be considered. First, in the annihilation of antimatter, much of the energy is lost as high-energy [[gamma radiation]], and especially also as [[neutrino]]s, so that only about 40% of ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; would actually be available if the antimatter were simply allowed to annihilate into radiations thermally.&lt;ref name="crawist" /&gt; Even so, the energy available for propulsion would be substantially higher than the ~1% of ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; yield of nuclear fusion, the next-best rival candidate.

Second, heat transfer from the exhaust to the vehicle seems likely to transfer enormous wasted energy into the ship (e.g. for 0.1''g'' ship acceleration, approaching 0.3 trillion watts per ton of ship mass), considering the large fraction of the energy that goes into penetrating gamma rays. Even assuming shielding was provided to protect the payload (and passengers on a crewed vehicle), some of the energy would inevitably heat the vehicle, and may thereby prove a limiting factor if useful accelerations are to be achieved.

More recently, [[Friedwardt Winterberg]] proposed that a matter-antimatter GeV gamma ray laser photon rocket is possible by a relativistic proton-antiproton pinch discharge, where the recoil from the laser beam is transmitted by the [[Mössbauer effect]] to the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="AA-20120821"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Winterberg |first=F. |title=Matter–antimatter gigaelectron volt gamma ray laser rocket propulsion |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576512002640 |date=21 August 2012 |journal=[[Acta Astronautica]] |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=34–39 |accessdate=25 April 2015 |bibcode = 2012AcAau..81...34W |doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rockets with an external energy source ====
Rockets deriving their power from external sources, such as a [[laser]], could replace their internal energy source with an energy collector, potentially reducing the mass of the ship greatly and allowing much higher travel speeds. [[Geoffrey A. Landis]] has proposed for an [[interstellar probe]], with energy supplied by an external laser from a base station powering an [[Ion thruster]].&lt;ref name="geoffreylandis.com"&gt;{{cite conference | url= http://www.geoffreylandis.com/laser_ion_pres.htp | title= Laser-powered Interstellar Probe | author= Landis, Geoffrey A. | conference= Conference on Practical Robotic Interstellar Flight | location= NY University, New York, NY | date= 29 August 1994 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131002200923/http://www.geoffreylandis.com/laser_ion_pres.htp | archivedate= 2 October 2013 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-rocket concepts ===
A problem with all traditional rocket propulsion methods is that the spacecraft would need to carry its fuel with it, thus making it very massive, in accordance with the [[rocket equation]]. Several concepts attempt to escape from this problem:&lt;ref name="crawist" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Bolonkin (2005). ''Non Rocket Space Launch and Flight''. Elsevier. {{ISBN|978-0-08-044731-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interstellar ramjets ====
In 1960, [[Robert W. Bussard]] proposed the [[Bussard ramjet]], a fusion rocket in which a huge scoop would collect the diffuse hydrogen in interstellar space, "burn" it on the fly using a [[proton–proton chain reaction]], and expel it out of the back. Later calculations with more accurate estimates suggest that the thrust generated would be less than the drag caused by any conceivable scoop design.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Yet the idea is attractive because the fuel would be collected ''en route'' (commensurate with the concept of ''energy harvesting''), so the craft could theoretically accelerate to near the speed of light. The limitation is due to the fact that the reaction can only accelerate the propellant to 0.12c. Thus the drag of catching interstellar dust and the thrust of accelerating that same dust to 0.12c would be the same when the speed is 0.12c, preventing further acceleration.

==== Beamed propulsion ====
[[File:Forward-sailcraft-scheme.png|thumb|This diagram illustrates [[Robert L. Forward]]'s scheme for slowing down an interstellar [[solar sail|light-sail]] at the star system destination.]]

A [[solar sail|light sail]] or [[magnetic sail]] powered by a massive [[laser]] or particle accelerator in the home star system could potentially reach even greater speeds than rocket- or pulse propulsion methods, because it would not need to carry its own [[reaction mass]] and therefore would only need to accelerate the craft's [[Payload (air and spacecraft)|payload]]. [[Robert L. Forward]] proposed a means for decelerating an interstellar light sail in the destination star system without requiring a laser array to be present in that system. In this scheme, a smaller secondary sail is deployed to the rear of the spacecraft, whereas the large primary sail is detached from the craft to keep moving forward on its own. Light is reflected from the large primary sail to the secondary sail, which is used to decelerate the secondary sail and the spacecraft payload.&lt;ref name="Forward1984RoundtripInterstellar"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Forward, R.L. | title=Roundtrip Interstellar Travel Using Laser-Pushed Lightsails | journal=J Spacecraft | volume=21 | issue=2 | pages=187–195 | date=1984 | doi=10.2514/3.8632 |bibcode = 1984JSpRo..21..187F }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, [[Geoffrey A. Landis]] of [[NASA]]'s Glen Research center also proposed a laser-powered, propulsion, sail ship that would host a diamond sail (of a few nanometers thick) powered with the use of [[solar energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=ITOF&amp;u=mcc_pv&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A444067493&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon|title=Alpha Centauri: Our First Target for Interstellar Probes|last=|first=|date=|via=go.galegroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this proposal, this interstellar ship would, theoretically, be able to reach 10 percent the speed of light.

A [[magnetic sail]] could also decelerate at its destination without depending on carried fuel or a driving beam in the destination system, by interacting with the plasma found in the solar wind of the destination star and the interstellar medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Magnetic Sails and Interstellar Travel |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |date=1990 |last=Andrews |first=Dana G. |last2=Zubrin |first2=Robert M. |volume=43 |pages=265–272 |url=http://www.lunarsail.com/LightSail/msit.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012182359/http://www.lunarsail.com/LightSail/msit.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-10-12 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/fellows/nov99/320Zubrin.pdf |format=PDF |title=NIAC Study of the Magnetic Sail |last=Zubrin |first=Robert |last2=Martin |first2=Andrew |date=1999-08-11 |accessdate=2014-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theoretical concepts ===

==== Faster-than-light travel ====
[[File:Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for NASA.jpg|thumb|Artist's depiction of a hypothetical ''Wormhole Induction Propelled Spacecraft'', based loosely on the 1994 [[Alcubierre drive|"warp drive"]] paper of [[Miguel Alcubierre]].]]
{{Main|Faster-than-light}}

Scientists and authors have postulated a number of ways by which it might be possible to surpass the speed of light, but even the most serious-minded of these are highly speculative.&lt;ref name="crawftl"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=Ian A.|title=Some thoughts on the implications of faster-than-light interstellar space travel|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=1995|volume=36|pages=205–218|bibcode=1995QJRAS..36..205C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also debatable whether faster-than-light travel is physically possible, in part because of [[Tachyonic antitelephone|causality]] concerns: travel faster than light may, under certain conditions, permit travel backwards in time within the context of [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feinberg|first1=G.|title=Possibility of faster-than-light particles|journal=Physical Review|date=1967|volume=159|issue=5|pages=1089–1105|doi=10.1103/physrev.159.1089|bibcode = 1967PhRv..159.1089F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed mechanisms for [[faster-than-light]] travel within the theory of general relativity require the existence of [[exotic matter]]&lt;ref name="crawftl" /&gt; and it is not known if this could be produced in sufficient quantity.

===== Alcubierre drive =====

{{Main|Alcubierre drive}}
In physics, the [[Alcubierre drive]] is based on an argument, within the framework of [[general relativity]] and without the introduction of [[wormhole]]s, that it is possible to modify a spacetime in a way that allows a spaceship to travel with an arbitrarily large speed by a local expansion of spacetime behind the spaceship and an opposite contraction in front of it.&lt;ref name="Warp Alcubierre"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |year=1994 |last=Alcubierre |first=Miguel |volume=11 |issue=5 |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0264-9381/11/5/001 |accessdate=2015-09-01 |pages=L73–L77|arxiv = gr-qc/0009013 |bibcode = 1994CQGra..11L..73A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, this concept would require the spaceship to incorporate a region of [[exotic matter]], or hypothetical concept of [[negative mass]].&lt;ref name="Warp Alcubierre" /&gt;

===== Artificial black hole =====

{{Main|Black hole starship}}
A theoretical idea for enabling interstellar travel is by propelling a starship by creating an artificial black hole and using a parabolic reflector to reflect its Hawking radiation. Although beyond current technological capabilities, a black hole starship offers some advantages compared to other possible methods. Getting the black hole to act as a power source and engine also requires a way to convert the Hawking radiation into energy and thrust. One potential method involves placing the hole at the focal point of a parabolic reflector attached to the ship, creating forward thrust. A slightly easier, but less efficient method would involve simply absorbing all the gamma radiation heading towards the fore of the ship to push it onwards, and let the rest shoot out the back.&lt;ref name="cranewestmoreland2009"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.1803 "Are Black Hole Starships Possible?"], Louis Crane, Shawn Westmoreland, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427361.000-dark-power-grand-designs-for-interstellar-travel.html |title=Dark power: Grand designs for interstellar travel |journal=New Scientist |date=25 November 2009 |issue=2736 |last=Chown |first=Marcus}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/5391989/a-black-hole-engine-that-could-power-spaceships A Black Hole Engine That Could Power Spaceships].

===== Wormholes =====
[[Wormhole]]s are conjectural distortions in spacetime that theorists postulate could connect two arbitrary points in the universe, across an [[Einstein–Rosen Bridge]]. It is not known whether wormholes are possible in practice.

=== Enzmann starship ===
{{Main|Enzmann starship}}
The Enzmann starship, as detailed by [[G. Harry Stine]] in the October 1973 issue of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'', was a design for a future [[starship]], based on the ideas of Robert Duncan-Enzmann. The spacecraft itself as proposed used a 12,000,000 ton ball of frozen [[deuterium]] to power 12–24 thermonuclear pulse propulsion units. Twice as long as the [[Empire State Building]] and assembled in-orbit, the spacecraft was part of a larger project preceded by [[interstellar probe]]s and telescopic observation of target star systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=1142 |work=Centauri Dreams |title=A Note on the Enzmann Starship |first=Paul |last=Gilster |date=April 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NASA research ===
[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] has been researching interstellar travel since its formation, translating important foreign language papers and conducting early studies on applying fusion propulsion, in the 1960s, and laser propulsion, in the 1970s, to interstellar travel.

The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]] (terminated in FY 2003 after a 6-year, $1.2-million study, because "No breakthroughs appear imminent.")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp] "Breakthrough Propulsion Physics" project at NASA Glenn Research Center, Nov 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; identified some breakthroughs that are needed for interstellar travel to be possible.&lt;ref name="NASAWarpDriveBreakthruTechs"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/warp.html http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/warp.html] ''Warp Drive, When? Breakthrough Technologies'' January 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey A. Landis]] of NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]] states that a laser-powered interstellar sail ship could possibly be launched within 50 years, using new methods of space travel. "I&amp;nbsp;think that ultimately we're going to do it, it's just a question of when and who," Landis said in an interview. Rockets are too slow to send humans on interstellar missions. Instead, he envisions interstellar craft with extensive sails, propelled by laser light to about one-tenth the speed of light. It would take such a ship about 43 years to reach Alpha Centauri if it passed through the system without stopping. Slowing down to stop at Alpha Centauri could increase the trip to 100 years,&lt;ref name="Malik20020319"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/star_voyage_020319-1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327233721/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/star_voyage_020319-1.html |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }} Malik, Tariq, "Sex and Society Aboard the First Starships." Science Tuesday, Space.com March 19, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a journey without slowing down raises the issue of making sufficiently accurate and useful observations and measurements during a fly-by.

=== 100 Year Starship study ===
The [[100 Year Starship]] (100YSS) is the name of the overall effort that will, over the next century, work toward achieving interstellar travel. The effort will also go by the moniker 100YSS. The 100 Year Starship study is the name of a one-year project to assess the attributes of and lay the groundwork for an organization that can carry forward the 100 Year Starship vision.

== Feasibility ==
The energy requirements make interstellar travel very difficult. It has been reported that at the 2008 Joint Propulsion Conference, multiple experts opined that it was improbable that humans would ever explore beyond the Solar System.&lt;ref name="O’Neill"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ian |last=O’Neill |date=Aug 19, 2008 |work=Universe Today |title=Interstellar travel may remain in science fiction |url=http://www.universetoday.com/2008/08/19/bad-news-insterstellar-travel-may-remain-in-science-fiction/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brice N. Cassenti, an associate professor with the Department of Engineering and Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, stated that at least 100 times the total energy output of the entire world [in a given year] would be required to send a probe to the nearest star.&lt;ref name="O’Neill" /&gt;

Astrophysicist Sten Odenwald stated that the basic problem is that through intensive studies of thousands of detected exoplanets, most of the closest destinations within 50 light years do not yield Earth-like planets in the star's habitable zones.&lt;ref name="Odenwald"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sten |last=Odenwald |date=April 2, 2015 |work=Huffington Post Blog |title=Interstellar travel: Where should we go?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-sten-odenwald/interstellar-travel-so-where-should-we-go_b_6971584.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the multi-trillion-dollar expense of some of the proposed technologies, travelers will have to spend up to 200 years traveling at 20% the speed of light to reach the best known destinations. Moreover, once the travelers arrive at their destination (by any means), they will not be able to travel down to the surface of the target world and set up a colony unless the atmosphere is non-lethal. The prospect of making such a journey, only to spend the rest of the colony's life inside a sealed habitat and venturing outside in a spacesuit, may eliminate many prospective targets from the list.

Moving at a speed close to the speed of light and encountering even a tiny stationary object like a grain of sand will have fatal consequences. For example, a gram of matter moving at 90% of the speed of light contains a kinetic energy corresponding to a small nuclear bomb (around 30kt TNT).

=== Interstellar missions not for human benefit ===

Explorative high-speed missions to [[Alpha Centauri]], as planned for by the [[Breakthrough Starshot|Breakthrough Starshot initiative]], are projected to be realizable within the [[21st century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1710.10732|last1=Kulkarni|first1=Neeraj|title=Relativistic Spacecraft Propelled by Directed Energy|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=155|issue=4|pages=155|last2=Lubin|first2=Philip|last3=Zhang|first3=Qicheng|year=2017|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aaafd2|bibcode=2018AJ....155..155K}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is alternatively possible to plan for unmanned slow-cruising missions taking millennia to arrive. These probes would not be for human benefit in the sense that one can not foresee whether there would be anybody around on earth interested in then back-transmitted science data. An example would be the Genesis mission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gros |first1=Claudius |title=Developing ecospheres on transiently habitable planets: the genesis project |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |date=5 September 2016 |volume=361 |issue=10 |doi=10.1007/s10509-016-2911-0|arxiv=1608.06087 |bibcode=2016Ap&amp;SS.361..324G }}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to bring unicellular life, in the spirit of [[directed panspermia]], to habitable but otherwise barren planets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/08/genesis-missions/497258/ How to Jumpstart Life Elsewhere in Our Galaxy], The Atlantic, 08-25-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively slow cruising Genesis probes, with a typical speed of &lt;math&gt;c/300&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to about &lt;math&gt;1000\,\mbox{km/s}&lt;/math&gt;, can be decelerated using a [[magnetic sail]]. Unmanned missions not for human benefit would hence be feasible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2153165-should-we-seed-life-through-the-cosmos-using-laser-driven-ships/ Should we seed life through the cosmos using laser-driven ships?], New Scientist, 11-13-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery of Earth-Like planets ==

In February 2017, NASA announced that its [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] had revealed seven Earth-size planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star 40 light-years away from our solar system.&lt;ref name="NASA Press Release Feb 22nd 2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Press Release Feb 22nd 2017 |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-telescope-reveals-largest-batch-of-earth-size-habitable-zone-planets-around }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of these planets are firmly located in the habitable zone, the area around the parent star where a rocky planet is most likely to have liquid water. The discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water – the key to life as we know it – under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31094">The '''knight of faith''' is an individual who has placed complete [[faith]] in himself and in God and can act freely and independently from the world. The 19th-century Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] vicariously discusses the knight of faith in several of his pseudonymic works, with the most in-depth and detailed critique exposited in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' and in ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]''.

==Overview==
Johannes de Silentio, Kierkegaard's pseudonymous author of ''Fear and Trembling'', argues that the knight of faith is the paradox, is the individual, absolutely nothing but the individual, without connections or pretensions.  The ''knight of faith'' is the individual who is able to gracefully embrace life: Kierkegaard put it this way in  ''Either/Or'', "When around one everything has become silent, solemn as a clear, starlit night, when the soul comes to be alone in the whole world, then before one there appears, not an extraordinary human being, but the eternal power itself, then the heavens open, and the I chooses itself or, more correctly, receives itself. Then the [[Personality psychology|personality]] receives the accolade of knighthood that ennobles it for an eternity."&lt;ref&gt;Either/Or part II p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; "The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite while the knight of resignation is a stranger and an alien."&lt;ref&gt;Fear and Trembling, Hong p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotebox |Most people live dejectedly in worldly sorrow and joy; they are the ones who sit along the wall and do not join in the dance. The knights of infinity are dancers and possess elevation. They make the movements upward, and fall down again; and this too is no mean pastime, nor ungraceful to behold. But whenever they fall down they are not able at once to assume the posture, they vacillate an instant, and this vacillation shows that after all they are strangers in the world. This is more or less strikingly evident in proportion to the art they possess, but even the most artistic knights cannot altogether conceal this vacillation. One need not look at them when they are up in the air, but only the instant they touch or have touched the ground–then one recognizes them. But to be able to fall down in such a way that the same second it looks as if one were standing and walking, to transform the leap of life into a walk, absolutely to express the sublime in the pedestrian–that only the knight of faith can do–and this is the one and only prodigy.|Johannes de Silentio|Fear and Trembling, 1843| width  = 33%| align  = right

== The three stages ==
{{Further information|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Three stages of life {{!}} The Three Stages}}
Kierkegaard recognized three levels of individual existence: The Aesthetic, The Ethical, and The Religious.  In ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', Silentio refers to individuals in each stage as the personal self, the civic self, and the religious self.  Each of these levels of existence envelops those below it: an ethical or religious person can still enjoy life aesthetically. Abraham learned how to keep his finite relationship with his family separate from his infinite relationship with God. He had to overcome the fear of having anxiety over losing something. Each individual experiences anxiety to a different degree and the fear of anxiety in a unique way.

== Knight of faith and the knight of infinite resignation ==
Kierkegaard's Silentio contrasts the knight of faith with the other two, knight of infinite resignation and the aesthetic realm's "slaves."  Kierkegaard uses the story of a princess and a man who is madly in love with her, but circumstances are that the man will never be able to realize this love in this world.  A person who is in the aesthetic stage would abandon this love, crying out for example, "Such a love is foolishness. The rich brewer's widow is a match fully as good and respectable."  A person who is in the ethical stage would not give up on this love, but would be resigned to the fact that they will never be together in this world.  The knight of infinite resignation may or may not believe that they may be together in another life or in spirit, but what's important is that the knight of infinite resignation gives up on their being together ''in this world; in this life.''

The knight of faith feels what the knight of infinite resignation feels, but with exception that the knight of faith believes that ''in this world; in this life'', they will be together.  The knight of faith would say "I believe nevertheless that I shall get her, in virtue, that is, of the absurd, in virtue of the fact that with God all things are possible."  This double movement is paradoxical because on the one hand it is humanly impossible that they would be together, but on the other hand the knight of faith is willing to believe that they will be together through divine possibility.

== Abraham and Isaac ==
[[File:Anthony van Dyck - Abraham and Isaac - WGA07427.jpg|right|thumb|350px|alt=Abraham and Isaac|Abraham and Isaac by [[Anthony van Dyck]]]]Johannes de Silentio believes that [[Abraham]] is one such knight of faith.  In the [[Book of Genesis]], God told Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac. Abraham dearly loved his son, but although bemoaning this fate, Abraham obeyed this command faithfully.  Just as he was about to commit the act, an angel stopped Abraham and rewarded him with his son and his steadfast faith.  In the same paradoxical act of committing murder, which would humanly kill off his son, Abraham believed, through virtue of the absurd, he would still have his son alive and well. Abraham was willing to risk everything for God. He was willing to act and in his action he received the highest good, his eternal happiness.

But "how" did Abraham act? He walked for 3 days step by step trusting in God. That is an example of keeping expectancy alive when any ethicist would say it should have died before he left home. What would have happened to his expectancy had he told Sarah? Or Isaac? He would have to explain himself but he couldn't. So he ventured for the truth of what he understood as the highest good. He kept his resolution intact. {{Quotation|To have faith in God-does that mean to think about how glorious it must be to have faith, to think about what peace and security faith can give? Not at all. Even to wish, where the interest, the subject’s interest, is far more evident, is not to have faith, is not to act. The individual’s relation to the thought-action is still continually only a possibility that he can give up. It is not denied that with regard to evil there are cases in which the transition is almost undetectable, but these cases must be explained in a special way. This is due to the fact that the individual is so in the power of habit that by frequently having made the transition from thinking to acting he has finally lost the power for it in the bondage of habit, which at his expense makes it faster and faster. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 339-340}} {{Quotation|If I, acting, am truly to venture and truly to aspire to the highest good, then there must be uncertainty and, if I may put it this way, I must have room to move. But the greatest space in which I can move, where there is space enough for the most rigorous gesture of infinite passion, is uncertainty of knowledge with regard to an eternal happiness, or that choosing it is lunacy in the finite sense-see, now there is room, now you can venture. Therefore eternal happiness, as the absolute good, has the remarkable quality that it can be defined only by the mode in which it is acquired, whereas other good, just because of the mode of acquisition is accidental or at any rate relatively dialectical, must be defined by the good itself. Money, for example, can be acquired by work and can also be obtained without work, and in turn both are different in many ways, but money still remains the same good. Knowledge, for example, is acquired differently according to talent and outward circumstances and therefore cannot be defined by the mode of acquisition. But nothing else can be said of eternal happiness than that it is the good that is attained by absolutely venturing everything. Any description of the gloriousness of this good is already an attempt, as it were, to make various modes of acquisition possible-an easier way, for example, and a harder way, which shows that the description is not describing the absolute good but only fancies doing it and essentially is talking about relative goods. Venture everything. There are no [[anecdotes]] to tell how [[Saint Peter|Peter]] became rich by working, and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] by playing the lottery, and Hans by inheritance, and Matthew by monetary reform, and Christopher by purchasing a piece of furniture from a secondhand dealer. But in another sense the [[discourse]] is long, indeed, the longest of all discourses, because to [[Risk|venture]] everything demands a [[Transparency (philosophy)|transparency]] of [[consciousness]] that is acquired only very slowly.

[[File:Jan Janssens - The Annunciation - WGA11940.jpg|left|thumb|200px|alt=The Annunciation|The Annunciation, by [[Jan Janssens]]]]Silentio personally believes that only two people were ever knights of faith: The [[Virgin Mary]], and Abraham.  It is also possible that Silentio regards [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] as a knight of faith.  Silentio grants that there may be knights of faith out there that we do not know about, or that there never have been knights of faith. This is because knights of faith exist alone in isolation. Yet Kierkegaard said the following in ''Repetition''. "The Young Man has gone through the same ordeal as Job but neither of them is a Knight of Faith."&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Repetition'' p. 209-210&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham wasn't really alone and living in isolation, he was only alone for three anxious filled days,&lt;ref&gt;Fear and Trembling, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; he was a married man who had a wife and children and God had promised him many more. Mary was alone with the angel for a short time but then she was a wife and later a mother. &lt;blockquote&gt;To be sure, Mary bore the child wondrously, but she nevertheless did it “after the manner of women,” and such a time is one of [[anxiety]], distress and [[paradox]]. The angel was indeed a ministering spirit, but he was not a meddlesome spirit who went to the other young maidens in Israel and said: Do not scorn Mary, the extraordinary is happening to her. The angel went only to Mary, and no one could understand her. Has any woman been as infringed upon, as Mary, and is it not true here also that the one whom God blesses he curses in the same breath? ''Fear and Trembling'' p. 65&lt;ref&gt;See Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 259-260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Knight of Faith is a man or woman of action. (See ''[[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses]]'' for the kind of action.) Abraham became a Knight of Faith because he voluntarily lifted the knife to sacrifice Isaac. Mary was a Knight of Faith because she volunteered to have Jesus. Jesus became a Knight of Faith because he voluntarily went to the cross. Paul was a Knight of Faith because he voluntarily (resolutely) went to Jerusalem. Kierkegaard considered Diogenes a Knight of Faith also but he didn't have to do great feats or conquer the universe to become one. Kierkegaard stressed the reversal of the inner and the outer in his first book, ''Either/Or''. He may have been thinking that Mary and Joseph, Job, Abraham, Paul, Socrates, and Jesus  all acted in the "innermost being" rather than in the external temporal world at times. However, he made a sharp distinction between Mary and others in his ''[[The Book on Adler]]''. Adler had an action in the innermost being but didn't think it was his job to do what he was told but that it was something he should tell the whole church (assembly) to do. An action in the inner-being is something completely different from an action in the outer being. How does one paint an inner action? How does one show an inner action on the stage? How does one describe it to another?&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 397ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard says, "When the [[Eleatics]] denied [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]], as everyone knows, came forward as an opponent. He literally did come forward, because he did not say a word but merely paced back and forth a few times, thereby assuming that he had sufficiently refuted them."&lt;ref&gt;''Repetition'', Hong p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; He used Diogenes in the same way in ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'' in 1844. {{Quotation|When Philip threatened to lay siege to the city of Corinth and all its inhabitants hastily bestirred themselves in defense, some polishing weapons, some gathering stones, some repairing the walls, Diogenes seeing all this hurriedly folded his mantle about him and began to roll his tub zealously back and forth through the streets. When he was asked why he did this he replied that he wished to be busy like all the rest, and rolled his tub lest he should be the only idler among so many industrious citizens. Such conduct is at any rate not sophistical, if Aristotle be right in describing sophistry as the art of making money. It is certainly not open to misunderstanding; it is quite inconceivable that Diogenes should have been hailed as the saviour and benefactor of the city. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Philosophical Fragments '', p. 5 (Kierkegaard was probably quoting Lucian of Samosata from [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6829 The Way to Write History)]}}

Kierkegaard kept to the same theme in his earlier and later works. "The great heroic feats are the stuff of history but they are not the stuff of life. Each single individual can do the great things of life. Each of us is born with the power to become what we become. "[Faith] can be grasped and held fast by the simplest of people, it is only the more difficult for the cultured to attain. What a wondrous, inspiring, Christian humanity: the highest is common for all human beings."&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 293-294&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;he then possesses himself as a task in such a way that it is chiefly to order, shape, temper, inflame, control-in short, to produce an evenness in the soul, a harmony, which is the fruit of the personal virtues. ... Someone can conquer kingdoms and countries without being a hero; someone else can prove himself a hero by controlling his temper. Someone can display courage by doing the out-of-the-ordinary, another by doing the ordinary. The question is-how does he do it? .... When the originality in earnestness is acquired and preserved, then there is succession and repetition, but as soon as originality is lacking in repetition, there is habit.The earnest person is earnest precisely through the originality from which he returns in repetition. It is said that a living and inward feeling preserves this originality, but the inwardness of the feeling is a fire that may cool as soon as earnestness no longer attends to it. Søren Kierkegaard Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 262, 298, Repetition p. 149&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Then he discovered that life was beautiful, that it was a new gloriousness of faith that no human being can give it to another, that every human being has what is highest, noblest, and most sacred in humankind. It is original in him, and every human being has it if he wants to have it-it is precisely the gloriousness of faith that it can be had only on this condition. Therefore, it is the only unfailing good, because it can be had only by constantly being acquired and can be acquired by continually being generated. ... The original natural power of endurance can be different in different individuals, but as soon as the fulfillment fails to come for such a long time that his original power is consumed and exhausted, then and only then will it become manifest whether a person has new oil in readiness, only then will his patience in expectancy become manifest. ... With a smile or with tears, one confesses that expectancy is in the soul originally. Only the true expectancy, which requires patience, also teaches patience. But true expectancy is such that it pertains to a person essentially and does not leave it up to his own power to bring about the fulfillment. Therefore every truly expectant person is in a relationship with God.  ... everyone has an original supply of oil with which to sustain expectancy. .... If it is really so that there is something in life that has or can have such power over a person that it little by little makes him forget everything that is noble and sacred and makes him a slave in the service of the world, of the moment; if it is really so that time has or can gain such power over a person that while it adds days to his life it also every passing day measures the greater distance of his life from the divine, until he, trapped in everydayness and habit, becomes alienated from the eternal and the original. Resolution is a wakening up to the eternal. ... The 'individual’ is the category of spirit, of spiritual awakening. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' (1843-1844) p. 14, 213-214, 220-221, 348 Søren Kierkegaard, ''Point of View'' p. 133 Lowrie&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;when in dealing with the concept of faith the historical is made so one-sidedly significant that the primitive originality of faith in the individual is overlooked, faith becomes a finite pettiness instead of a free infinitude. ... Repetition and recollection are the same movement, except in opposite directions, for what is recollected has been, is repeated backward, whereas genuine repetition is recollected forward. ... The transition from [[Potentiality and actuality|possibility to actuality]] is, as Aristotle rightly teaches, a movement. This cannot be said in the language of abstraction at all or understood therein, because abstraction can give movement neither time nor space, which presuppose it or which it presupposes. There is a halt, a [[Leap of faith|leap]]. ''The Concept of Anxiety'', Nichol p. 62-63 ''Repetition'' p. 131-132, Concluding Postscript p. 341-342&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

Kierkegaard always points the individual forward just as he did with Abraham. He's always expectant of the good instead of dreading the evil. He trusted God. It's the same with the single individual who has to make a resolution to give some finite thing up and has found that the finite has become of infinite importance. &lt;blockquote&gt;Abraham had faith, and had faith for this life. In fact, if his faith had been only for the life to come, he certainly would have more readily discarded everything in order to rush out of a world to which he did not belong. ''Fear and Trembling'' p. 20&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kierkegaard uses this extreme example of the [[paradox]] of faith to help people who are afraid to give something up or to take a risk without any certainty of reward. Abraham was willing to risk everything to follow God and Christ was willing to risk everything to teach humanity how to love. Neither of them knew what would come of it. Abraham learned how to love God but did he learn how to love his neighbor and himself?&lt;ref&gt;''Fear and Trembling'' p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I am anxious about a past misfortune, then this is not because it is in the past but because it may be repeated, i.e., become future. If I am anxious because of a past offense, it is because I have not placed it in an essential relation to myself as past and have in some deceitful way prevented it from being past. If indeed it is actually past, then I cannot be anxious but only repentant. If I do not repent, I have allowed myself to make my relation to the offense dialectical, and by this the offense itself has become a possibility, and not something past. If I am anxious about the punishment, it is only because this has been placed in a dialectical relation to the offense (otherwise I suffer my punishment), and then I am anxious for the possible for the future. Thus we have returned to where we were in Chapter I. Anxiety is the psychological state that precedes sin. It approaches sin as closely as possible, as anxiously as possible, but without explaining sin, which breaks forth only in the [[Leap of faith|qualitative leap]]. Søren Kierkegaard, ''The Concept of Anxiety'', Nichol p. 91-92&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Maurice Stanley Friedman]] compared Kierkegaard and Kafka in his 1963 book ''Problematic rebel, an image of modern man'' (p. 386) &lt;blockquote&gt;K. is at times lacking in courage and at other times brazenly impudent, and he is far from "observing every rule of propriety with a glad and confident enthusiasm," like Kierkegaard's "knight of faith." But he does not exalt the Castle "meanly" and, unlike the villagers he dares "to enter those palaces where not merely the memory of the elect abides but . . . the elect themselves." He knows the Angst of Kierkegaard's "knight of faith" who is "born outside the universal" and walks "a solitary path, narrow and steep . . . without meeting a single traveller." Passage after passage in The Castle, indeed, shows K. as essentially a Single One, who has the courage to meet the officials face to face and who is willing to dispense with all the universal patterns and official procedures if he can do so.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jacques Maritain]] wrote in 1964, “Soren Kierkegaard was a contemporary of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. But it was only at the beginning of the twentieth century that his name began to become famous and his influence to be felt. Neither a [[philosopher]] in the strict sense of the word-although nourished in philosophy-and yet a philosopher in the sense of being a lay thinker; nor a theologian nor a prophet (obsessed by his feeling for the requirements of the [[Gospel]] and by his own unworthiness, he hardly dared to profess himself a Christian), and yet a kind of prophet and a knight of faith, and, at the end of his life, “a witness to the truth” in his passionate revolt against the established church, this poet of the religious, as he called himself, is a figure complex and ambiguous enough to occupy generations of interpreters and to justify their disagreements.”&lt;ref&gt;Moral Philosophy, Jacques Maritain, Charles Scribner’s Sons, New York, 1964, pp. 353-354; see pages 353-370 (Person and Liberty for more)&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that [[Theodor Haecker]] was a knight of faith.&lt;ref&gt;see Haeker’s book Journal in the Night https://archive.org/stream/journalinthenigh009030mbp#page/n7/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raffaello Sanzio - Theological Virtues (Faith) - WGA18670.jpg|right|thumb|400px|alt=Theological Virtues (Faith)|[[Theological Virtues]] by [[Raphael]]]] Kierkegaard used his book ''Fear and Trembling'' to make the claim that Abraham, Mary and a tax collector were also knights of faith. These were just common people so faith isn't just for the "chosen few", he says, "[[Moses]] struck the rock, but  he did not have faith. … Abraham was God’s chosen one, and it was the Lord who imposed the ordeal.”&lt;ref&gt;''Fear and Trembling'', Hong p. 19,&lt;/ref&gt; He says "artists go forward by going backward"&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard Journals and papers 1A 86 September 29, 1835&lt;/ref&gt; by writing about Abraham's faith, Job's faith, Paul's faith and even Christ's faith and by creating imaginary constructions about "heroes" of faith they make Christianity difficult for the simple individual who wants to be a Christian. Yet at the same time churches often make Christianity "a matter of course". Faith just grows by itself, it needs no testing by the individual who wants to have faith, it ends up explained by external functions rather than the internal acknowledgement by the single individual who wants to be a Christian. Artistically faith becomes something impossible to reproduce in actual life. Only the person who is existing can reproduce [[Fruit of the Holy Spirit|faith, expectancy, patience, love]]  and the [[Self-control|resolution]] to hold fast to the expectation no matter what happens in his or her own life to the best of their ability. A person can become a Knight of Faith by acting without certainty. This is what Abraham did in ''Fear and Trembling'' and The Young Man failed to do in ''Repetition''. One says, I'll do it because everything within me says I should and the other says I'll do it if everything outside of me says I should. Kierkegaard described the difference well in ''Either/Or''. &lt;blockquote&gt;If one wishes to strip people of their illusions in order to lead them to something more true, here as always you [the esthete] are “at your service in every way.” On the whole you are tireless in tracking down illusions in order to smash them to pieces. You talk so sensibly, with such experience, that anyone who does not know you better must believe that you are a steady man. But you have by no means arrived at what is true. You stopped with destroying the illusion, and since you did it in every conceivable direction, you actually have worked your way into a new illusion-that one can stop with this. Yes, my friend, you are living in an illusion, and you are achieving nothing. Here I have spoken the word that has always had such a strange effect on you. Achieve-“So who is achieving something? That is precisely one of the most dangerous illusions. I do not busy myself in the world at all; I amuse myself the best I can, and I am particularly amused by those people who believe that they are achieving, and is it not indescribably funny that a person believes that? I refuse to burden my life with such grandiose pretensions.” Søren Kierkegaard, ''Either/Or Part II'', Hong, p. 78-79&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Biographical==
Kierkegaard was raised by parents who were at opposite poles of the spectrum of faith. His father read philosophy and studied with the leaders of the Church of Denmark while his mother couldn't even read. He had learned the terror of belief at an early age. He stood far to the right of the two extremes of the consciousness of sin: those who believe that they sin because Adam sins, so there is no use trying to stop sinning; and those who believe that every sin is like [[crucifixion|crucifying]] [[Christ]] and possibly commit suicide because they despise themselves so much. One is in danger of being too light-minded about sin, and the other is in danger of being halted or stopped at every moment in fear and trembling. His father taught him the terror of Christianity but his mother showed him the lighter side of the faith. He sought his own balance between the two and he thought his contribution to the discussion about beauty, truth and faith was worth reading. This is how he explained it to himself in ''[[Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]'', and in his Journals (1849). He died not knowing if he had achieved anything at all but he still had faith.&lt;blockquote&gt;If you had loved people then the earnestness of life might have taught you not to be strident but to become silent, and when you were in distress at sea and did not see land, then at least not to involve others in it; it might have taught you to smile at least as long as you believed anyone sought in your face an explanation, a witness. We do not judge you for doubting, because doubt is a crafty passion, and it can certainly be difficult to tear oneself out of its snares. What we require of the doubter that he be silent. What doubt did not make him happy-why then confide to others what will make them just as unhappy. Doubt is a deep and crafty passion. But he whose soul is not gripped by it so inwardly that he becomes speechless is only shamming this passion, therefore what he says is not only false in itself but above all on his lips. The expectancy of faith, then, is victory. The doubt that comes from the outside does not disturb it, since it disgraces itself by speaking. Yet doubt is guileful, on secret paths it sneaks around a person, and when faith is expecting victory, [[doubt]] whispers that this expectancy is a deception. An expectancy that without a specified time and place is nothing but a deception; In that way one may always go on waiting; such an expectancy is a circle into which the [[soul]] is bewitched and from which it does not escape. In the expectancy of [[faith]], the soul is indeed prevented from falling out of itself, as it were, into multiplicity; it remains in itself, but it would be the worst evil that could befall a person if it escaped from this cycle. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Two Upbuilding Discourses'', May 16, 1843&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When I began as an author of ''Either/Or'', I no doubt had a far more profound impression of the terror of Christianity than any clergyman in the country. I had a fear and trembling such as perhaps no one else had. Not that I therefore wanted to relinquish [[Christianity]]. No, I had another interpretation of it. For one thing I had in fact learned very early that there are men who seem to be selected for suffering, and, for another thing, I was conscious of having sinned much and therefore supposed that Christianity had to appear to me in the form of this [[terror]]. But how cruel and false of you, I thought, if you use it to terrify others, perhaps upset every so many happy, loving lives that may very well be truly Christian. It was as alien as it could possibly be to my nature to want to terrify others, and therefore I both sadly and perhaps also a bit proudly found my joy in comforting others and in being gentleness itself to them-hiding the terror in my own interior being. So my idea was to give my [[contemporaries]] (whether or not they themselves would want to understand) a hint in [[humor]]ous form (in order to achieve a lighter tone) that a much greater pressure was needed-but then no more; I aimed to keep my heavy burden to myself, as my cross. I have often taken exception to anyone who was a [[sin]]ner in the strictest sense and then promptly got busy terrifying [[Other (philosophy)|other]]s. Here is where ''Concluding Postscript'' comes in. …

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23184">In [[mathematics]], a '''low-discrepancy sequence''' is a [[sequence]] with the property that for all values of ''N'', its subsequence ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; has a low [[discrepancy of a sequence|discrepancy]].

Roughly speaking, the discrepancy of a sequence is low if the proportion of points in the sequence falling into an arbitrary set ''B'' is close to proportional to the [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] of ''B'', as would happen on average (but not for particular samples) in the case of an [[equidistributed sequence]]. Specific definitions of discrepancy differ regarding the choice of ''B'' ([[hyperspheres]], hypercubes, etc.) and how the discrepancy for every B is computed (usually normalized) and combined (usually by taking the worst value).

Low-discrepancy sequences are also called '''quasi-random''' or '''sub-random''' sequences, due to their common use as a replacement of uniformly distributed [[random sequence|random numbers]].
The "quasi" modifier is used to denote more clearly that the values of a low-discrepancy sequence are neither random nor [[pseudorandom]], but such sequences share some properties of random variables and in certain applications such as the [[quasi-Monte Carlo method]] their lower discrepancy is an important advantage.

==Applications==

[[Image:Subrandom Kurtosis.gif|thumb|370px|right|Error in estimated kurtosis as a function of number of datapoints. 'Additive subrandom' gives the maximum error when ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;({{radic|5}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2. 'Random' gives the average error over six runs of random numbers, where the average is taken to reduce the magnitude of the wild fluctuations]]

Subrandom numbers have an advantage over pure random numbers in that they cover the domain of interest quickly and evenly. They have an advantage over purely deterministic methods in that deterministic methods only give high accuracy when the number of datapoints is pre-set whereas in using subrandom sequences the accuracy typically improves continually as more datapoints are added, with full reuse of the existing points. On the other hand, subrandom sets can have a significant lower discrepancy for a given number of points than purely random sequences.

Two useful applications are in finding the [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of a [[probability density function]], and in finding the [[derivative]] function of a deterministic function with a small amount of noise. Subrandom numbers allow higher-order [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] to be calculated to high accuracy very quickly.

Applications that don't involve sorting would be in finding the [[mean]], [[standard deviation]], [[skewness]] and [[kurtosis]] of a statistical distribution, and in finding the [[integral]] and global [[maxima and minima]] of difficult deterministic functions. Subrandom numbers can also be used for providing starting points for deterministic algorithms that only work locally, such as [[Newton–Raphson iteration]].

Subrandom numbers can also be combined with search algorithms. A binary tree [[Quicksort]]-style algorithm ought to work exceptionally well because subrandom numbers flatten the tree far better than random numbers, and the flatter the tree the faster the sorting. With a search algorithm, subrandom numbers can be used to find the [[mode (statistics)|mode]], [[median]], [[confidence intervals]] and [[cumulative distribution function|cumulative distribution]] of a statistical distribution, and all [[local minima]] and all solutions of deterministic functions.

=== Low-discrepancy sequences in numerical integration ===

At least three methods of [[numerical integration]] can be phrased as follows.
Given a set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;} in the interval &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, approximate the integral of a function ''f'' as the average of the function evaluated at those points:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1 f(u)\,du \approx \frac{1}{N}\,\sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i). &lt;/math&gt;

If the points are chosen as ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''i''/''N'', this is the ''rectangle rule''.
If the points are chosen to be randomly (or [[pseudorandom]]ly) distributed, this is the ''[[Monte Carlo method]]''.
If the points are chosen as elements of a low-discrepancy sequence, this is the ''quasi-Monte Carlo method''.
A remarkable result, the '''Koksma–Hlawka inequality''' (stated below), shows that the error of such a method can be bounded by the product of two terms, one of which depends only on ''f'', and the other one is the discrepancy of the set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}.

It is convenient to construct the set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;} in such a way that if a set with ''N''+1 elements is constructed, the previous ''N'' elements need not be recomputed.
The rectangle rule uses points set which have low discrepancy, but in general the elements must be recomputed if ''N'' is increased.
Elements need not be recomputed in the random Monte Carlo method if ''N'' is increased,
but the point sets do not have minimal discrepancy.
By using low-discrepancy sequences we aim for low discrepancy and no need for recomputations, but actually low-discrepancy sequences can only be incrementally good on discrepancy if we allow no recomputation.

==Definition of discrepancy==

The ''discrepancy'' of a set P = {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;} is defined, using [[Harald Niederreiter|Niederreiter's]] notation, as
:&lt;math&gt; D_N(P) = \sup_{B\in J}
  \left|  \frac{A(B;P)}{N} - \lambda_s(B)  \right|&lt;/math&gt;

where
λ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''s''-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure]],
''A''(''B'';''P'') is the number of points in ''P'' that fall into ''B'',
and ''J'' is the set of ''s''-dimensional intervals or boxes of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{i=1}^s [a_i, b_i) = \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{R}^s : a_i \le x_i &lt; b_i \} \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; 0 \le a_i &lt; b_i \le 1 &lt;/math&gt;.

The ''star-discrepancy'' ''D''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'') is defined similarly, except that the supremum is taken over the set ''J''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; of rectangular boxes of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{i=1}^s [0, u_i) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is in the half-open interval &lt;nowiki&gt;[0, 1)&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

The two are related by

:&lt;math&gt;D^*_N \le D_N \le 2^s D^*_N . \,&lt;/math&gt;

Note: With these definitions, discrepancy represents the worst-case or maximum point density deviation of a uniform set. However, also other error measures are meaningful, leading to other definitions and variation measures. For instance, L2 discrepancy or modified centered L2 discrepancy are also used intensively to compare the quality of uniform point sets. Both are much easier to calculate for large N and s.

==The Koksma–Hlawka inequality==

Let Ī&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; be the ''s''-dimensional unit cube,
Ī&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; = [0, 1] &amp;times; ... &amp;times; [0, 1].
Let ''f'' have [[bounded variation]] ''V''(''f'') on Ī&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; in the sense of [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and Krause.
Then for any ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;
in ''I''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; =
&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0, 1&lt;nowiki&gt;)&lt;/nowiki&gt; &amp;times; ... &amp;times;
&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0, 1&lt;nowiki&gt;)&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)
      - \int_{\bar I^s} f(u)\,du \right|
     \le V(f)\, D_N^* (x_1,\ldots,x_N).
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Jurjen Ferdinand Koksma|Koksma]]–[[Edmund Hlawka|Hlawka]] inequality is sharp in the following sense: For any point set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;} in ''I''&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there is a function ''f'' with bounded variation and ''V''(''f'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 such that

:&lt;math&gt;
\left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)
      - \int_{\bar I^s} f(u)\,du \right|&gt;D_{N}^{*}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)-\varepsilon.
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the quality of a numerical integration rule depends only on the discrepancy D&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;).

==The formula of Hlawka–Zaremba==

Let &lt;math&gt;D=\{1,2,\ldots,d\}&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\emptyset\neq u\subseteq D&lt;/math&gt; we
write
:&lt;math&gt;
dx_u:=\prod_{j\in u} dx_j
&lt;/math&gt;
and denote by &lt;math&gt;(x_u,1)&lt;/math&gt; the point obtained from ''x'' by replacing the
coordinates not in ''u'' by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)
      - \int_{\bar I^s} f(u)\,du=
\sum_{\emptyset\neq u\subseteq D}(-1)^{|u|}
\int_{[0,1]^{|u|}} \operatorname{disc}(x_u,1)\frac{\partial^{|u|}}{\partial x_u}f(x_u,1) \, dx_u,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{disc}(z)= \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \prod_{j=1}^d 1_{[0,z_j)}(x_{i,j}) - \prod_{j=1}^d z_i&lt;/math&gt; is the discrepancy function.

==The &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; version of the Koksma–Hlawka inequality==

Applying the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] for integrals and sums to the Hlawka–Zaremba identity, we obtain an &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; version of the Koksma–Hlawka inequality:

: &lt;math&gt;
\left|\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)
      - \int_{\bar I^s} f(u)\,du\right|\le
\|f\|_d \operatorname{disc}_d (\{t_i\}),
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{disc}_d(\{t_i\})=\left(\sum_{\emptyset\neq u\subseteq D}
\int_{[0,1]^{|u|}} \operatorname{disc}(x_u,1)^2 \, dx_u\right)^{1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\|f\|_d = \left(\sum_{u\subseteq D}
\int_{[0,1]^{|u|}}
\left|\frac{\partial^{|u|}}{\partial x_u} f(x_u,1)\right|^2 dx_u\right)^{1/2}.
&lt;/math&gt;
L2 discrepancy has a high practical importance because fast explicit calculations are possible for a given point set. This way it is easy to create point set optimizers using L2 discrepancy as criteria.

==The Erd&amp;#337;s–Turán–Koksma inequality==

It is computationally hard to find the exact value of the discrepancy of large point sets. The [[Paul Erd&amp;#337;s|Erd&amp;#337;s]]–[[Turán]]–[[Jurjen Ferdinand Koksma|Koksma]] inequality provides an upper bound.

Let ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; be points in ''I''&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; and ''H'' be an arbitrary positive integer. Then

:&lt;math&gt;
D_{N}^{*}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\leq
\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^s
\left(
\frac{2}{H+1}+
\sum_{0&lt;\|h\|_{\infty}\leq H}\frac{1}{r(h)}
\left|
\frac{1}{N}
\sum_{n=1}^{N} e^{2\pi i\langle h,x_n\rangle}
\right|
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
r(h)=\prod_{i=1}^s\max\{1,|h_i|\}\quad\mbox{for}\quad h=(h_1,\ldots,h_s)\in\Z^s.
&lt;/math&gt;

==The main conjectures==

'''Conjecture 1.''' There is a constant ''c''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; depending only on the dimension ''s'', such that

:&lt;math&gt;D_{N}^{*}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\geq c_s\frac{(\ln N)^{s-1}}{N}&lt;/math&gt;

for any finite point set  {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}.

'''Conjecture 2.'''  There is a constant ''c''&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; depending only on ''s'', such that

:&lt;math&gt;D_{N}^{*}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\geq c'_s\frac{(\ln N)^{s}}{N}&lt;/math&gt;

for infinite number of ''N'' for any infinite sequence  ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,....

These conjectures are equivalent. They have been proved for ''s'' ≤ 2 by [[W. M. Schmidt]]. In higher dimensions, the corresponding problem is still open. The best-known lower bounds are due to [[K. F. Roth]].

==Lower bounds==

Let ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. Then

:&lt;math&gt;
D_N^*(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\geq\frac{1}{2N}
&lt;/math&gt;

for any finite point set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}.

Let ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. W. M. Schmidt proved that for any finite point set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;},

:&lt;math&gt;
D_N^*(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\geq C\frac{\log N}{N}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
C=\max_{a\geq3}\frac{1}{16}\frac{a-2}{a\log a}=0.023335\dots
&lt;/math&gt;

For arbitrary dimensions ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, K.F. Roth proved that

:&lt;math&gt;
D_N^*(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\geq\frac{1}{2^{4s}}\frac{1}{((s-1)\log2)^\frac{s-1}{2}}\frac{\log^{\frac{s-1}{2}}N}{N}
&lt;/math&gt;

for any finite point set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}.
This bound is the best known for ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;3.

==Construction of low-discrepancy sequences==

Because any distribution of random numbers can be mapped onto a uniform distribution, and subrandom numbers are mapped in the same way, this article only concerns generation of subrandom numbers on a multidimensional uniform distribution.

There are constructions of sequences known such that
:&lt;math&gt;
D_N^{*}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\leq C\frac{(\ln N)^{s}}{N}.
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''C'' is a certain constant, depending on the sequence. After Conjecture 2, these sequences are believed to have the best possible order of convergence. Examples below are the [[van der Corput sequence]], the [[Halton sequence]]s, and the [[Sobol sequence]]s. One general limitation is that construction methods can usually only guarantee the order of convergence. Practically, low discrepancy can be only achieved if N is large enough, and for large given s this minimum N can be very large. This means running a Monte-Carlo analysis with e.g. s=20 variables and N=1000 points from a low-discrepancy sequence generator may offer only a very minor accuracy improvement.

===Random numbers===

Sequences of subrandom numbers can be generated from random numbers by imposing a negative correlation on those random numbers. One way to do this is to start with a set of random numbers &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;[0,0.5)&lt;/math&gt; and construct subrandom numbers &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; which are uniform on &lt;math&gt;[0,1)&lt;/math&gt; using:

&lt;math&gt;s_i = r_i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; odd and &lt;math&gt;s_i = 0.5 + r_i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; even.

A second way to do it with the starting random numbers is to construct a random walk with offset 0.5 as in:

: &lt;math&gt;s_i = s_{i-1} + 0.5+ r_i \pmod 1. \, &lt;/math&gt;

That is, take the previous subrandom number, add 0.5 and the random number, and take the result [[modular arithmetic|modulo]]&amp;nbsp;1.

For more than one dimension, [[Latin squares]] of the appropriate dimension can be used to provide offsets to ensure that the whole domain is covered evenly.

[[Image:Subrandom 2D.gif|thumb|270px|right|Coverage of the unit square. Left for additive subrandom numbers with ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.5545497...,&amp;nbsp;0.308517... Right for random numbers. From top to bottom. 10, 100, 1000, 10000 points.]]

===Additive recurrence===

For any irrational &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the sequence

: &lt;math&gt;s_n = \{s_0 + n\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt;

has discrepancy tending to 0. (Note the sequence can be defined recursively by &lt;math&gt;s_{n+1} = (s_n + \alpha)\bmod\, 1&lt;/math&gt;.) A good value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; gives lower discrepancy than a sequence of independent uniform random numbers.

The discrepancy can be bounded by the [[approximation exponent]] of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. If the approximation exponent is &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, then for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the following bound holds:&lt;ref name="kn05"&gt;Kuipers and Niederreiter, 2005, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; D_N((s_n)) = O_\varepsilon (N^{-1/(\mu-1)+\varepsilon}).&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem]], the approximation exponent of any irrational algebraic number is 2, giving a bound of &lt;math&gt;N^{-1+\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; above.

The value of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; with lowest discrepancy is &lt;ref&gt;http://mollwollfumble.blogspot.com/, Subrandom numbers&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;c = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2} \approx 0.618034.&lt;/math&gt;

Another value that is nearly as good is:

: &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{2}-1 \approx 0.414214. \, &lt;/math&gt;

In more than one dimension, separate subrandom numbers are needed for each dimension.  In higher dimensions, one set of values that can be used is the square roots of [[primes]] from two up, all taken modulo 1:

: &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{7}, \sqrt{11}, \ldots \, &lt;/math&gt;

The recurrence relation above is similar to the recurrence relation used by a [[Linear congruential generator]], a poor-quality pseudorandom number generator:&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Knuth ''The Art of Computer Programming'' Vol. 2, Ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;r_i = \bmod(a r_{i-1} + c, m)&lt;/math&gt;

For the low discrepancy additive recurrence above, a and m are chosen to be 1.  Note, however, that this will not generate independent random numbers, so should not be used for purposes requiring independence.  The [[list of pseudorandom number generators]] lists methods for generating independent pseudorandom numbers.
Note: In few dimensions, recursive recurrence leads to uniform sets of good quality, but for larger s (like s&gt;8) other point set generators can offer much lower discrepancies.

===van der Corput sequence===
{{Main article|van der Corput sequence}}

Let

:&lt;math&gt;
n=\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}d_k(n)b^k
&lt;/math&gt;

be the ''b''-ary representation of the positive integer ''n'' ≥ 1, i.e. 0 ≤ ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &lt; ''b''. Set

:&lt;math&gt;
g_b(n)=\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}d_k(n)b^{-k-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then there is a constant ''C'' depending only on ''b'' such that (''g''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''))&lt;sub&gt;''n'' ≥ 1&lt;/sub&gt;satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;
D^*_N(g_b(1),\dots,g_b(N))\leq C\frac{\log N}{N},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; is the  
'''[[Low-discrepancy sequence#Definition of discrepancy|star discrepancy]]'''.

===Halton sequence===
[[Image:Halton sequence 2D.svg|thumb|right|First 256 points of the (2,3) Halton sequence]]
{{Main article|Halton sequence}}

The Halton sequence is a natural generalization of the van der Corput sequence to higher dimensions. Let ''s'' be an arbitrary dimension and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; be arbitrary [[coprime]] integers greater than 1. Define

:&lt;math&gt;
x(n)=(g_{b_1}(n),\dots,g_{b_s}(n)).
&lt;/math&gt;

Then there is a constant ''C'' depending only on ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, such that sequence {''x''(''n'')}&lt;sub&gt;''n''≥1&lt;/sub&gt; is a ''s''-dimensional sequence with

:&lt;math&gt;
D^*_N(x(1),\dots,x(N))\leq C'\frac{(\log N)^s}{N}.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Hammersley set===

[[File:Hammersley set 2D.svg|thumb|right|2D Hammersley set of size 256]]
Let ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''b''&lt;sub&gt;s-1&lt;/sub&gt; be [[coprime]] positive integers greater than 1. For given ''s'' and ''N'', the ''s''-dimensional [[John Hammersley|Hammersley]] set of size ''N'' is defined by&lt;ref name="HammersleyHandscomb1964"&gt;{{cite book|title=Monte Carlo Methods|last1=Hammersley|first1=J. M.|last2=Handscomb|first2=D. C.|year=1964|doi=10.1007/978-94-009-5819-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
x(n)=(g_{b_1}(n),\dots,g_{b_{s-1}}(n),\frac{n}{N})
&lt;/math&gt;

for ''n'' = 1, ..., ''N''. Then

:&lt;math&gt;
D^*_N(x(1),\dots,x(N))\leq C\frac{(\log N)^{s-1}}{N}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is a constant depending only on ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
Note: The formulas show that the Hammersley set is actually the Halton sequence, but we get one more dimension for free by adding a linear sweep. This is only possible if N is known upfront. A linear set is also the set with lowest possible one-dimensional discrepancy in general. Unfortunately, for higher dimensions, no such "discrepancy record sets" are known. For s=2, most low-discrepancy point set generators deliver at least near-optimum discrepancies.

===Sobol sequence===
{{Main article|Sobol sequence}}

The Antonov–Saleev variant of the Sobol sequence generates numbers between zero and one directly as binary fractions of length &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, from a set of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; special binary fractions, &lt;math&gt;V_i, i = 1, 2, \dots, w&lt;/math&gt; called direction numbers. The bits of the [[Gray code]] of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G(i)&lt;/math&gt;, are used to select direction numbers. To get the Sobol sequence value &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; take the [[exclusive or]] of the binary value of the Gray code of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; with the appropriate direction number. The number of dimensions required affects the choice of &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Poisson disk sampling ===
{{main article|Supersampling#Poisson_disc}}
[[Supersampling#Poisson disc|Poisson disk sampling]] is popular in video games to rapidly placing objects in a way that appears random-looking
but guarantees that every two points are separated by at least the specified minimum distance.&lt;ref&gt;
Herman Tulleken.
[http://devmag.org.za/2009/05/03/poisson-disk-sampling/ "Poisson Disk Sampling"].
''Dev.Mag'' Issue 21, March 2008.
&lt;/ref&gt; This does not guarantee low discrepancy (as e. g. Sobol), but at least a significantly lower discrepancy than pure random sampling.

==Graphical examples==
The points plotted below are the first 100, 1000, and 10000 elements in a sequence of the Sobol' type.
For comparison, 10000 elements of a sequence of pseudorandom points are also shown.
The low-discrepancy sequence was generated by [[ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software|TOMS]] algorithm 659.&lt;ref&gt;P. Bratley and B.L. Fox in ''ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software'', vol. 14, no. 1, pp 88—100&lt;/ref&gt;
An implementation of the algorithm in [[Fortran]] is available from [[Netlib]].

[[File:Daniel McNaughton c 1856.jpg|thumb|Daniel M'Naghten ''circa'' 1856]]
The '''M'Naghten rule''' (pronounced, and sometimes spelled, '''McNaughton''') is any variant of the 1840s jury instruction in a [[criminal case]] when there is a [[defense of insanity]]: 
{{blockquote|that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and{{nbsp}}... that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|632}} }}

The rule was formulated as a reaction to the acquittal in 1843 of [[Daniel M'Naghten]] on the charge of murdering [[Edward Drummond]], whom M'Naghten had mistaken for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]].&lt;ref&gt;''M’Naghten’s Case'' [1843] All ER Rep 229&lt;/ref&gt; M'Naghten fired a pistol at the back of Peel's secretary, Edward Drummond, who died five days later. The [[House of Lords]] asked a panel of judges, presided over by [[Nicolas Conyngham Tindal|Sir Nicolas Conyngham Tindal]], [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]], a series of hypothetical questions about the defence of insanity. The principles expounded by this panel have come to be known as the ''M'Naghten Rules'', though they have gained any status only by usage in the common law and M'Naghten himself would have been found guilty if they had been applied at his trial.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Elliott, ''The rules of insanity: moral responsibility and the mentally ill offender'', SUNY Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-7914-2951-2}}, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael T. Molan, Mike Molan, Duncan Bloy, Denis Lanser, ''Modern criminal law'' (5 ed), Routledge Cavendish, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85941-807-4}}, p.352&lt;/ref&gt;  

The rules so formulated as ''M'Naghten's Case'' 1843 10 C &amp; F 200&lt;ref name="m'naghtenscase"&gt;{{cite web|last=United Kingdom House of Lords Decisions|title=DANIEL M'NAGHTEN'S CASE. May 26, June 19, 1843.|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1843/J16.html|publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute|accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been a standard test for criminal liability in relation to mentally disordered defendants in [[common law]] jurisdictions ever since, with some minor adjustments. When the tests set out by the Rules are satisfied, the accused may be adjudged "not guilty by reason of insanity" or "guilty but insane" and the [[sentence (law)|sentence]] may be a mandatory or discretionary (but usually indeterminate) period of treatment in a secure hospital facility, or otherwise at the discretion of the [[court]] (depending on the country and the offence charged) instead of a punitive disposal.

The insanity defence is recognized in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[England and Wales]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]] and most [[U.S. state]]s with the exception of Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Utah, and Vermont&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullsection.cfm?Title=13&amp;Chapter=157&amp;Section=04802|title=Vermont Statutes Online|website=www.leg.state.vt.us|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not all of these jurisdictions still use the M'Naghten Rules.

==Historical development==
There are various justifications for the exemption of the insane from criminal responsibility. When mental incapacity is successfully raised as a [[defense (legal)|defence]] in a criminal trial it absolves a defendant from liability: it applies [[public policy (law)|public policies]] in relation to criminal responsibility by applying a rationale of [[compassion]], accepting that it is [[morality|morally]] wrong to punish a person if that person is deprived permanently or temporarily of the capacity to form a necessary mental intent that the definition of a crime requires. Punishment of the obviously mentally ill by the state may undermine public confidence in the penal system. A [[utilitarian]] and [[humanitarian]] approach suggests that the interests of society are better served by treatment of the illness rather than punishment of the individual.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Historically, insanity was seen as grounds for leniency. In pre-Norman times in England there was no distinct criminal code&amp;nbsp;– a murderer could [[Weregild|pay compensation to the victim's family]] under the principle of "buy off the spear or bear it". The insane person's family were expected to pay any compensation and look after. In Norman times insanity was not seen as a defence in itself but a special circumstance in which the jury would deliver a guilty verdict and refer the defendant to the King for a pardon&lt;ref&gt;Walker, N. (1968).

In ''R v Arnold'' 1724 16 How St. Tr. 765, the test for insanity was expressed in the following terms
&lt;blockquote&gt;
whether the accused is totally deprived of his understanding and memory and knew what he was doing "no more than a wild beast or a brute, or an infant".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The next major advance occurred in ''[[James Hadfield|Hadfield's Trial]]'' 1800 27 How St. Tr. 765 in which the court decided that a crime committed under some delusion would be excused only if it would have been excusable had the delusion been true. This would deal with the situation, for example, when the accused imagines he is cutting through a loaf of bread, whereas in fact he is cutting through a person's neck.

Each jurisdiction may have its own standards of the insanity defense. More than one standard can be applied to any case based on multiple jurisdictions.

==The M'Naghten Rules==
The [[House of Lords]] delivered the following exposition of the Rules:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:the jurors ought to be told in all cases that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.&lt;ref name="m'naghtenscase" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The central issue of this definition may be stated as "did the defendant know what they were doing, or, if so, that it was wrong?", and the issues raised have been analysed in subsequent appellate decisions:

===Presumption of sanity and burden of proof===
Sanity is a [[rebuttable presumption]] and the burden of proof is on the party denying it; the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities, that is to say that mental incapacity is more likely than not. If this burden is successfully discharged, the party relying upon it is entitled to succeed. In Lord Denning's judgement in ''[[Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland]]'' 1963 AC 386, whenever the defendant makes an issue of his state of mind, the prosecution can adduce evidence of insanity. However, this will normally only arise to negate the defence case when [[automatism (law)|automatism]] or [[diminished responsibility]] is in issue. In practical terms, the defence will be more likely to raise the issue of mental incapacity to negate or minimise criminal liability. In ''R v Clarke'' 1972 1 All E R 219 a defendant charged with a [[shoplifting]] claimed she had no ''[[mens rea]]'' because she had absent-mindedly walked out of the shop without paying because she suffered from [[Clinical depression|depression]]. When the prosecution attempted to adduce evidence that this constituted insanity within the Rules, she changed her plea to guilty, but on appeal the Court ruled that she had been merely denying [[mens rea]] rather than raising a defence under the Rules and her conviction was quashed. The general rule was stated that the Rules apply only to cases in which the defect of reason is substantial.

===Disease of the mind===
Whether a particular condition amounts to a disease of the mind within the Rules is not a medical but a legal question to be decided in accordance with the ordinary rules of interpretation. It seems that any disease which produces a malfunctioning of the mind is a disease of the mind and need not be a disease of the brain itself. The term has been held to cover numerous conditions:
{{unordered list
| In ''R v Kemp'' [1957] 1 QB 399 [[arteriosclerosis]] or a hardening of the arteries caused loss of control during which the defendant attacked his wife with a hammer. This was an internal condition and a disease of the mind.
| In ''[[R v Sullivan]]'' [1984] AC 156 during an [[epilepsy|epileptic]] episode, the defendant caused [[grievous bodily harm]]: epilepsy was an internal condition and a disease of the mind, and the fact that the state was transitory was irrelevant.
| In ''R v Quick; R v Paddison'' [1973] QB 910&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1973/1.html BAILII]&lt;/ref&gt; committed an assault while in a state of [[hypoglycaemia]] caused by the insulin he had taken, the alcohol he had consumed and not eating properly. It was ruled that the judge should have left the defence of automatism open to him, so his conviction was quashed (he had pleaded guilty rather than not guilty by reason of insanity). This was where the internal/external divide doctrine was first expressed, probably due to judicial reluctance to hospitalise someone for a condition that could be cured by a sugar lump. It is doubtful that a jury would have accepted a defence of automatism, but nonetheless the issue should have been left to them.
| In ''R v Hennessy'' [1989] 1 WLR 287&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1989/1.html BAILII]&lt;/ref&gt; a diabetic stole a car and drove it while suffering from a mild attack of [[hyperglycaemia]] caused by stress and a failure to take his insulin. [[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|Lane LCJ]] said at 294
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:In our judgment, stress, anxiety and depression can no doubt be the result of the operation of external factors, but they are not, it seems to us, in themselves separately or together external factors of the kind capable in law of causing or contributing to a state of automatism. They constitute a state of mind which is prone to recur. They lack the feature of novelty or accident, which is the basis of the distinction drawn by [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] in ''R v Sullivan'' 1984 AC 156, 172. It is contrary to the observations of Devlin J., to which we have just referred in ''Hill v Baxter'' (1958) 1 QB 277, 285. It does not, in our judgment, come within the scope of the exception of some external physical factor such as a blow on the head or the administration of an anaesthetic.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
| In ''Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland'' [1963] AC 386&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1961/3.html BAILII]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Denning]] observed ''[[obiter dicta|obiter]]'' that a crime committed while sleepwalking would appear to him to be one committed as an automaton. However, the ruling in ''R v Sullivan'' that diseases of the mind need have no permanence led many academics to suggest that sleepwalkers might well be found to be suffering from a disease of the mind with internal causes unless there was clear evidence of an external causal factor.
| In ''[[R v Burgess]]''[1991] 2 QB 92 the Court of Appeal ruled that the defendant, who wounded a woman by hitting her with a video recorder while sleepwalking, was insane under the M'Naghten Rules. Lord Lane said, "We accept that sleep is a normal condition, but the evidence in the instant case indicates that sleepwalking, and particularly violence in sleep, is not normal."
}}

The courts have clearly drawn a distinction between internal and external factors affecting a defendant's mental condition. This is partly based on risk of recurrence, whereby the High Court of Australia has expressed that the defence of automatism is unable considered when the mental disorder has been proved transient and as such not likely to recur.&lt;ref&gt;R v Falconer (1990) 171 CLR 30 at 30 [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/49.html AUSTLII]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the distinction between insanity and automatism is difficult because the distinction between internal and external divide is difficult. Many diseases consist of a predisposition, considered an internal cause, combined with a precipitant, which would be considered an external cause. Actions committed while sleepwalking would normally be considered as "non-insane automatism", but often alcohol and stress trigger bouts of sleepwalking and make them more likely to be violent. The diabetic who takes insulin but does not eat properly&amp;nbsp;– is that an internal or external cause?

===Nature and quality of the act===
This phrase refers to the physical nature and quality of the act, rather than the moral quality. It covers the situation where the defendant does not know what he is physically doing. Two common examples used are:
* The defendant cuts a woman's throat under the delusion that he is cutting a loaf of bread,
* The defendant chops off a sleeping man's head because he has the deluded idea that it would be great fun to see the man looking for it when he wakes up.
The judges were specifically asked if a person could be excused if he committed an offence in consequence of an insane delusion. They replied that if he labours under such partial delusion only, and is not in other respects insane, "he must be considered in the same situation as to responsibility as if the facts with respect to which the delusion exists were real". This rule requires the court to take the facts as the accused believed them to be and follows ''Hadfield's Trial'', above. If the delusions do not prevent the defendant from having mens rea there will be no defence. In ''R v Bell'' 1984 Crim. LR 685 the defendant smashed a van through the entrance gates of a holiday camp because "It was like a secret society in there, I wanted to do my bit against it" as instructed by God. It was held that, as the defendant had been aware of his actions, he could neither have been in a state of automatism nor insane, and the fact that he believed that God had told him to do this merely provided an explanation of his motive and did not prevent him from knowing that what he was doing was wrong in the legal sense.

===Knowledge that the act was wrong===
The interpretation of this clause is a subject of controversy among legal authorities, and different standards may apply in different jurisdictions.

"Wrong" was interpreted to mean ''legally'' wrong, rather than ''morally'' wrong, in the case of ''Windle'' 1952 2QB 826; 1952 2 All ER 1 246, where the defendant killed his wife with an overdose of [[aspirin]]; he telephoned the police and said, "I suppose they will hang me for this." It was held that this was sufficient to show that although the defendant was suffering from a mental illness, he was aware that his act was wrong, and the defense was not allowed. Under this interpretation, there may be cases where the mentally ill know that their conduct is legally prohibited, but it is arguable that their mental condition prevents them making the connection between an act being legally prohibited and the societal requirement to conform their conduct to the requirements of the criminal law.

As an example of a contrasting interpretation in which defendant lacking knowledge that the act was ''morally'' wrong meets the M'Naghten standards, there are the instructions the judge is required to provide to the jury in cases in New York State when the defendant has raised an insanity plea as a defense:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... with respect to the term "wrong", a person lacks substantial capacity to know or appreciate that conduct is wrong if that person, as a result of mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate either that the conduct was against the law or that it was against commonly held moral principles, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CJI2d[NY] INSTRUCTIONS OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY
|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/judges/cji/1-General/cjigc.shtml|publisher=New York State Unified Court System|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jury Instructions for trying plea of "INSANITY (LACK OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY BY REASON OF MENTAL DISEASE OR DEFECT) Penal Law S.40.15"|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/judges/cji/1-General/Defenses/CJI2d.Insanity.pdf|publisher=New York State Unified Court System|accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is other support in the authorities for this interpretation of the standards enunciated in the findings presented to the House of Lords regarding M'Naghten's case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If it be accepted, as can hardly be denied, that the answers of the judges to the questions asked by the House of Lords in 1843 are to be read in the light of the then existing case-law and not as novel pronouncements of a legislative character, then the [Australian] High Court's analysis in ''Stapleton's Case'' is compelling.  Their exhaustive examination of the extensive case-law concerning the defense of insanity prior to and at the time of the trial of M'Naughten establishes convincingly that it was morality and not legality which lay as a concept behind the judges' use of "wrong" in the M'Naghten rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Norval|title='WRONG' IN THE M'NAUGHTEN RULES|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2230.1953.tb02133.x/abstract|publisher=Modern Law Review|accessdate=2012-08-05|date=October 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Offences of strict liability===
In ''DPP v Harper'' (1997) it was held that insanity is not generally a defense to [[strict liability]] offences. In this instance, the accused was driving with excess alcohol. By definition, the accused is sufficiently aware of the nature of the activity to commit the ''actus reus'' of driving and presumably knows that driving while drunk is legally wrong. Any other feature of the accused's knowledge is irrelevant.

===The function of the jury===
Section 1 of the [[Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991]] provides that a jury shall not return a special verdict that "the accused is not guilty by reason of insanity" except on the written or oral evidence of two or more registered medical practitioners of whom at least one has special experience in the field of mental disorder. This may require the jury to decide between conflicting medical evidence which they are not necessarily equipped to do, but the law goes further and allows them to disagree with the experts if there are facts or surrounding circumstances which, in the opinion of the court, justify the jury in coming to that conclusion.

===Sentencing===
Under section 3 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991:
# Where the sentence for the offence to which the finding relates is fixed by law (e.g. [[murder]]), the court must make a hospital order restricting discharge without limitation of time. Otherwise, if there is adequate medical evidence and the defendant has been convicted of an imprisonable offence, a hospital order requires that the defendant be admitted to and detained in a hospital for treatment for a mental disorder (see sections 37–43 of the [[Mental Health Act 1983]]).
# In any other case the court may make:
#* a hospital order and an order restricting discharge either for a limited or unlimited period of time;
#* or in appropriate circumstances,
#** a guardianship order;
#** a supervision and treatment order; or
#** an order for absolute discharge.

===Criticisms===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2009}}
There have been four major criticisms of the law as it currently stands:
* '''Medical irrelevance''' - The legal definition of insanity has not advanced significantly since 1843; in 1953 evidence was given to the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment that doctors even then regarded the legal definition to be obsolete and misleading. This distinction has led to absurdities such as
** even though a legal definition suffices, mandatory hospitalisation can be ordered in cases of murder; if the defendant is not ''medically'' insane, there is little point in requiring medical treatment.
** [[diabetes]] has been held to facilitate a defence of insanity when it causes [[hyperglycemia]], but not when it causes [[hypoglycemia]].
** Article 5 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], imported into English law by the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], provides that a person of unsound mind may be detained only where proper account of objective medical expertise has been taken. As yet, no cases have occurred in which this point has been argued.
* '''Ineffectiveness''' - The rules currently do not distinguish between defendants who represent a public danger and those who do not. Illnesses such as diabetes and epilepsy can be controlled by medication such that sufferers are less likely to have temporary aberrations of mental capacity, but the law does not recognise this.
* '''Sentencing for murder''' - A finding of insanity may well result in indefinite confinement in a hospital, whereas a conviction for murder may well result in a determinate sentence of between ten and 15 years; faced with this choice, it may be that defendants would prefer the certainty of the latter option. The defence of diminished responsibility in section 2(1) of the Homicide Act would reduce the conviction to voluntary manslaughter with more discretion on the part of the judge in regards to sentencing.
* '''Scope''' - A practical issue is whether the fact that an accused is labouring under a "mental disability" should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for negating responsibility i.e. whether the test should also require an incapacity to understand what is being done, to know that what one is doing is wrong, or to control an impulse to do something and so demonstrate a causal link between the disability and the potentially criminal acts and [[omission (criminal law)|omissions]]. For example, the Irish insanity defence comprises the M'Naghten Rules and a control test that asks whether the accused was debarred from refraining from committing the act because of a defect of reason due to mental illness (see ''Doyle v Wicklow County Council'' 1974) 55 IR 71. The [[Butler Committee]] recommended that proof of severe mental disorder should be sufficient to negate responsibility, in effect creating an [[irrebuttable presumption]] of irresponsibility arising from proof of a severe mental disorder. This has been criticized as it assumes a lack of criminal responsibility simply because there is evidence of some sort of mental dysfunction, rather than establishing a standard of criminal responsibility. According to this view, the law should be geared to [[culpability]] not mere psychiatric diagnosis.

==Alternative rules==
The [[insanity defense]] article has a number of alternative tests that have been used at different times and places. As one example, the [[ALI test]] replaced the M'Naughten rule in many parts of the United States for many years until the 1980s; when in the aftermath of [[John Hinckley]] shooting [[President Ronald Reagan]] many ALI states returned to a variation of M'Naughten.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|615}}

==In fiction==
The M'Naghten rules are at the focus of [[John Grisham]]'s legal thriller ''[[A Time to Kill (Grisham novel)| Time to Kill]]''. The M'Naghten rules apply in the US State of [[Mississippi]], where the plot is set, and using them is the only way for the lawyer protagonist to save his client.

The '''Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination''' (MCAD) is the primary agency for [[civil rights]] [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]], outreach, and training in the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]]. Following the recommendation of a 1944 committee appointed by [[Governor of Massachusetts]] [[Maurice Tobin]] to establish a commission to enforce laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religious creed, national origin, or ancestry, the [[Massachusetts General Court]] created the Fair Employment Practices Commission in 1946. The Commission took 96 complaints, conducted 60 interviews, and handled 500 phone inquiries in its first year alone.&lt;ref name="MCAD history"/&gt; The name was changed to the current name in 1950 to reflect the expansion of its jurisdiction and power from employment to housing and public accommodations.&lt;ref name="MCAD history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/mcad/history.html |title=The History of MCAD |accessdate=2008-08-12 |publisher=Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4390">'''Meaning''' is a concept used in psychology as well as in other fields such as philosophy, linguistics, semiotics and sociology. 

These [[multidisciplinary]] uses of the term are not independent and can more or less overlap. Within each of these fields, there are different ways in which the term ''meaning'' is constructed and used; each construction can match related constructions in other fields. At the deepest level, each construction is associated with an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] position. The concept of "meaning" is thus used differently in different epistemological traditions in each field. The [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]], for example, associated meaning with scientific verification.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[The verifiability theory of meaning]].&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of meaning is therefore understood differently in different schools of psychology (as well as in different schools overall).

==Behaviorism==

According to [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]], meaning is the modern version of "idea". Like an idea, a meaning is said to be expressed or communicated by an utterance. A meaning explains the occurrence of a particular word in the sense that if there had been a different meaning to be expressed, a different word would probably have appeared. Meaning has certain advantages over ideas because they have the possibility to be located outside the skin, and thus, according to Skinner, meanings can be observed directly.&lt;ref&gt;Sellars, Wilfrid (1980). ''Behaviorism, language and meaning''. Pacific Philosophical Quarterly, 61, 3-30. http://www.ditext.com/sellars/blm.html&lt;/ref&gt; (Verbal Behavior. Chapter One. B.F. SKINNER. 1947

==Cognitive psychology==
[[Jerome Bruner]], one of the founding fathers of cognitive psychology, wrote: "Very early on, ... emphasis began shifting from 'meaning' to 'information', from the construction of meaning to the processing of information. These are profoundly different matters. The key factor in the shift was the introduction of computation as the ruling metaphor and of computability as a necessary criterion of a good theoretical model. Information is indifferent with respect to meaning..." (Bruner, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;4).&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, Jerome (1990). Acts of meaning. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==German critical psychology== 
German [[critical psychology]] provides a metatheoretical framework for research on both psychological and computational tasks. One important part of this is the logical-historical development of the meaning category. It is shown that meaning is nothing absolute but subjective. Meaning is neither a property of things nor only present as an imagination of cognition. Thus, meanings cannot be "defined" or "assigned" as commonly thought. Meanings arise from societal production of use-value." (Meretz, 1999, p. 126)&lt;ref&gt;Meretz, Stefan (1999). Meaning concepts used in psychology and computer sciences. In: Maiers, Wolfgang et al. ''Challenges to theoretical psychology'' North York, Ontario: Captus Press, Inc. (pp. 120-128).&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar understanding developed in cultural studies of science: "Cultural studies thereby articulate dynamic, expressive conceptions of meaning, knowledge, and power, which contrast sharply with the standard approaches to these phenomena within philosophy and social theory (Rouse 1996,&lt;ref&gt;Rouse J. (1996). ''Engaging Science: How to Understand its Practices Philosophically''. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt; 1999&lt;ref&gt;Rouse J. (1999). Understanding scientific practices. In: Biagioli M (ed.) ''The Science Studies Reader''. Routledge, New York,
pp. 442-456.&lt;/ref&gt;). On such accounts, meaning is not a property of utterances or actions; the term `meaning' instead articulates the ways in which such performances inferentially draw upon and transform the field of prior performances in which they are situated." (Rouse, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;3126)&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, J. (2001). Cultural Studies of Science. In: Smelser, N. J. &amp; Baltes, P. B. (eds.) International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences. Amsterdam: Elsevier. (Pp. 3125-3127).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9890">'''Metatheatre''', and the closely related term '''metadrama''', describes the aspects of a [[Play (theatre)|play]] that draw attention to its nature as [[drama]] or [[theatre]], or to the circumstances of its performance.

These may include: the direct address of the audience (especially in [[Soliloquy|soliloquies]], [[aside]]s, [[prologue]]s, and [[epilogue]]s); expression of an awareness of the presence of the audience (whether they are addressed directly or not); an acknowledgement of the fact that the people performing are [[actor]]s (and not actually the [[Character (arts)|character]]s they are playing); an element whose meaning depends on the difference between the [[Representation (arts)|represented]] time and place of the drama (the fictional world) and the time and place of its theatrical presentation (the reality of the theatre event); plays-within-plays (or masques, spectacles, or other forms of performance within the drama); [[Metareference|references]] to [[acting]], theatre, dramatic writing, [[Audience|spectatorship]], and the frequently employed [[metaphor]] according to which "[[all the world's a stage]]" (''Theatrum mundi''); scenes involving [[eavesdropping]] or other situations in which one or several characters observe another or others, such that the former relate to the behaviour of the latter as if it were a staged performance for their benefit.

The words "metatheatre" and "metadrama" combine [[theatre]] or [[drama]] with the Greek prefix "meta—", which implies "a level beyond" the subject that it qualifies.

Metatheatre has in modern times involved into the term "meta acting", usually in reference to movies, whereas the character gives an indication that he realizes he is in a movie, also called "breaking the fourth wall."

==In the history of drama==

===Greece and Rome===
Metatheatricality has been a dimension of drama ever since its invention in the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatre of]] [[classical Greece]] 2,500 years ago. One major purpose of this metatheatricality was to keep then spectators away from utter involvement or belief in the development of the plot presented.  [[Ancient Greek comedy]] in particular made frequent use of it (though examples can also be found in [[tragedy]]).

===Early modern theatre===
In [[English Renaissance theatre|early modern English theatre]], characters often adopt a downstage position in close contact with the audience and comment on the actions of others sarcastically or critically, while the other actors assume the convention that the first remains unheard and unseen while so doing. Following the work of Robert Weimann and others, [[theatre studies]] uses the terms ''locus'' and ''platea'' (relating to "location" and "place", borrowed from [[medieval theatre]]) to describe this performance effect—the ''locus'' is localised within the drama such that its characters are absorbed in its fiction and unaware of the presence of the audience; while the ''platea'' is a neutral space in close contact with the spectators that exists on the boundary between the fiction and the audience's reality.

When the defeated [[Cleopatra]], performed by a [[boy player]] in act five of Shakespeare's ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', fears her humiliation in the theatres of Rome in plays staged to ridicule her, she says: "And I shall see some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness in the posture of a whore". While the actor is not necessarily engaged at this point in the direct address of the audience, the reality of the male performer beneath the female character is openly, and comically, acknowledged (qualifying in important ways, supported further in the scene and the play as a whole, the tragic act of her imminent suicide). Metatheatricality of this kind is found in most plays of that period.

In ''Hamlet'', there occurs the following exchange between [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] and [[Polonius]]:
{{poemquote
|text=Hamlet: ... ''My lord, you played once i'th'university, you say.''
Polonius: ''That I did my lord, and was accounted a good actor.''
Hamlet: ''And what did you enact?''
Polonius: ''I did enact [[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]. I was killed i'th'Capitol. [[Brutus]] killed me.''
Hamlet: ''It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.''
|title=''[[Hamlet]]'' (3.2.95–100).}}
If the only significance of this exchange lay in its reference to characters within another play, it might be called a [[metadrama]]tic (or "[[Intertextuality|intertextual]]") moment. Within its original performance context, however, there is a more specific, metatheatrical reference. Historians assume that Hamlet and Polonius were played by the same actors who had played the roles mentioned in Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' a year or two earlier on the same stage.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (1985, 5).&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the dramatic linking of the character of Hamlet with the murderer Brutus (foreshadowing Hamlet's murder of Polonius later in the play), the audience's awareness of the identities of the actors and their previous roles is comically referenced.

===Modern theatre===

====The fourth wall====
In the modern era, the rise of [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] and [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] led to the development of a performance [[Dramatic convention|convention]] known as the "[[fourth wall]]". The metaphor suggests a relationship to the [[mise-en-scène]] behind a [[proscenium]] arch. When a scene is set indoors and three of the walls of its room are presented onstage, the "fourth" of them would run along the line dividing the room from the auditorium (technically called the "proscenium"). The fourth wall is thus an invisible, imagined wall that separates the actors from the audience. While the audience can see through this "wall", the convention assumes, the actors act as if they cannot. In this sense, the "fourth wall" is a convention of [[acting]], rather than of [[set design]]. It can be created regardless of the presence of any actual walls in the set, or the physical arrangement of the [[Theater (building)|theatre building]] or performance space, or the actors' distance from or proximity to the audience.

"Breaking the fourth wall" is any instance in which this performance convention, having been adopted more generally in the drama, is disregarded. The temporary suspension of the convention in this way draws attention to its use in the rest of the performance. This act of drawing attention to a play's performance conventions is metatheatrical.

A similar effect of metareference is achieved when the performance convention of avoiding direct contact with the camera, generally used by actors in a television drama or film, is temporarily suspended. The phrase "breaking the fourth wall" is used to describe such effects in those media.

====Modernism====
Instances of metatheatricality ''other'' than "breaking the fourth wall" occur in plays by many of the realist playwrights, including [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[August Strindberg]], and [[Anton Chekhov]]. As with [[modernism]] more generally, metareference in the form of metatheatricality comes to play a far more central and significant role in the modernist theatre, particularly in the work of [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Thornton Wilder]], [[Samuel Beckett]], and many others.

In more recent times, ''[[With the People from the Bridge]]'' by [[Dimitris Lyacos]] employs metatheatrical techniques whereby a makeshift play centered on the vampire legend is viewed from the angle of a spectator who records in his diary the setting and preparations as well as the sequence of the actors' soliloquies interspersed with personal notes on the development of the performance.

==Origin of the term==
The term "metatheatre" was coined by [[Lionel Abel]] in 1963 and has since entered common critical usage. Abel described metatheatre as reflecting comedy and tragedy, at the same time, where the audience can laugh at the protagonist while feeling empathetic simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Abel 2003, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Abel relates it to the character of [[Alonso Quijano|Don Quixote]], whom he considers to be the prototypical, metatheatrical, self-referring character. Don Quixote looks for situations of which he wants to be a part, not waiting for life to oblige, but replacing reality with imagination when the world is lacking in his desires.&lt;ref&gt;Abel 2003, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The character is aware of his own theatricality.

Having started his musical career as a [[folk rock]] singer, in the late 1960s, he developed a fusion between [[Romanian folklore]] and [[Music of Asia|Eastern music]], especially [[Music of India|Indian sound]], moving into [[psychedelic music]]. He founded ''[[Ceata Melopoică]]'' ensemble, with whom he recorded a [[concept album]]. These and his solo acts earned him a cult following among rebellious youth, establishing his reputation as one of the most original contributors to Romanian pop music. Florian was also an early member of ''[[Cenaclul Flacăra]]'', a traveling music and literature circle, but parted with it when it became increasingly [[nationalism|nationalistic]].

Before 1980, Florian was turning his attention to [[electronic music]] and [[New wave music|new wave]]. In parallel, like other artists on the Romanian folk scene, he was pursuing his interest in non-pop ventures, from [[experimental rock]] and [[minimal music]] to [[biomusic]], and exhibiting his [[installation art]]. In 1986, Florian escaped Communist Romania, having by then been exposed to much [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]], and took up cultural and scientific projects in [[West Germany]]. Since the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian Revolution]], he has made frequent returns, playing at numerous festivals and composing film scores.

==Biography==

===Beginnings===
Born in [[Satu Mare]], Mircea Florian began his musical education as a pianist and [[saxophonist]], before turning to guitar, [[blockflute]], [[mandolin]] and various other instruments.&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Plămădeală, Horia Diaconescu, [http://www.muzicisifaze.com/interviu.php?id=10 "Interviu cu Mircea Florian"], ''Muzici şi Faze'', October 3, 2005; retrieved September 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He first took classes at the Satu Mare Art School,&lt;ref name="floriandoctor"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/mircea-florian-titlul-doctor-honoris-causa-din-partea-universitatii-vasile-goldis-932415.html "Mircea Florian, titlul Doctor Honoris Causa din partea Universităţii 'Vasile Goldiş' "], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', June 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and first became interested in [[performing arts]] while an avid spectator of the local ''Medrano'' Circus (the place where he also witnessed the first concert by a rock band).&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt;

Florian then studied at the [[Mihai Eminescu National College (Satu Mare)|Eminescu High School]], where he had musical appearances with the band ''Zburătorii'' (1965).&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; A while after, he also gave his first [[one-man show]], which included a dance routine.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; In parallel to state-run education, he took private courses in music and visual arts.&lt;ref name="floriandoctor"/&gt; Florian first came into contact with the burgeoning [[hippie]] movement of the [[Western world|West]], and met Romanians who, despite facing tight scrutiny from the communist authorities, wanted to replicate it locally. In 2005, he stated that the fundamental difference was in the [[drug culture]], which Romanians had little access to, adding: "In any case the manner in which the artistic act was supposed to be carried out here was different from what one could experience in the West. Romanian artists created for a tighter circle, of (proper) connoisseurs."&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; Elsewhere, he also noted that hippie culture was essentially becoming more accessible to Romanians by the end of the 1960s: "I remember that, once a record came out, fresh off the Western market, no more than a week would pass before it got to Romania, brought over by some sailor or an acquaintance who had been visiting 'out on the outside', or through heaven knows what channels..."&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://freshgoodminimal.ro/?p=1944 "Mircea Florian: 'M-am născut la ţanc!' "], [http://freshgoodminimal.ro/ freshgoodminimal.ro]; retrieved September 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the decade's pop acts, Florian was most impressed by [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Beatles]] and [[Leonard Cohen]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; At the time, he became an avid listener of clandestine Western radio, where he first heard the music of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Steve Reich]] and especially [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]]: "Nono's music was so new, so captivating, so rich in meanings... I got hooked on it forever!"&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; He carried out his first experiments with electronic music at the age of 16, when, in his search for new "[[tone color]]s", he turned a [[sound generator]] into a keyboard instrument.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

''Zburătorii'' disbanded in 1967, and Florian left Satu Mare for [[Bucharest]], the capital.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; He studied [[cybernetics]] at the [[Politehnica University of Bucharest|Politehnica University]], from 1967 to 1972, and was part of the first-ever graduating class at Politehnica's Faculty of Economic Calculations.&lt;ref name="floriandoctor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; After arriving in Bucharest, he played for a while with a band called ''Lotus'', which, he recalls, was a "pretty interesting" folk project.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; In 1968, during the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]], Florian also had his first brush-in with communist censorship: a song of his, which was transparently critical of the [[Soviet Union]], was banned from [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|public radio]]. According to popular account, DJ [[Cornel Chiriac]] ignored such commands and played the song, being promptly sacked as a result (the other version attributes his dismissal to having played The Beatles' ambiguous record "[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.europalibera.org/author/21228.html "Cornel Chiriac"], at [[Radio Free Europe]] Romanian edition; retrieved September 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lotus''{{'}} major breakthrough came in 1969, when they performed at the ''3-Gaură-3'' Club, where music critic [[Florin Silviu Ursulescu]] organized Romania's first [[American folk revival|American folk]]-inspired music festival.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; As noted by Florian, ''Lotus'' appeared alongside the "first wave" of Romanian folk singers, among them [[Mircea Vintilă]], [[Dorin Liviu Zaharia]] and [[Doru Stănculescu]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; At around the same time, Florian joined the ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'' literary club,&lt;ref name="llpaunescu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Lucian Laszlo, [http://www.adevarul.ro/locale/satu_mare/Satu_Mare-_Octavian_Bud-_-Paunescu_a_fost_ca_un_zeu_pentru_noi_0_366563634.html "Octavian Bud: 'Păunescu a fost ca un zeu pentru noi' "], in ''[[Adevărul]]'' Satu Mare edition, November 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dan C. Mihăilescu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/tema-saptamanii/articol/acasa-%E2%80%9E-d%C3%BCrftiger-zeit%E2%80%9D "Acasă... ''in dürftiger Zeit''"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 311, January–February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and provided the [[avant-garde jazz]] background to the [[Surrealism|Surrealistic]] poems recited live by [[Valery Oisteanu]].&lt;ref name="psvalery"&gt;{{ro icon}} Peter Sragher, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/cum-dispare-valery-oisteanu-in-sunetele-vocii-sale-6473645/ "Cum dispare Valery Oişteanu în sunetele vocii sale"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', July 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, Florian's work in mathematics opened new fields for his musical experimentation. The major factor, he notes, was his familiarization with [[transistor computer]]s at the Economic Calculations laboratory and the [[Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies]], during an era of "sheer luck"—that is, when [[liberalization]] allowed Romania to trade in electronics with the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; He had a free hand to work in [[algorithmic composition]] and [[computer music]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; He was officially employed by the computer industry from age 22, supplementing his salary with semi-compulsory dispatches "on location", which allowed him to invest his own money in various cutting-edge musical instruments.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

===''Florian în Labirint'' to ''Ceata Melopoică''===
By 1971, Mircea Florian had grown dissatisfied with the band concept,&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; and committed himself mainly to solo projects. As such, in what he calls his "white period" of [[acoustic rock]], he notably became the opening act for the celebrated rock band [[Transsylvania Phoenix]].&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"&gt;{{ro icon}} Iulia Popovici, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Tot-ce-ne-nconjoara-e-un-instrument-muzical.-Interviu-cu-Mircea-FLORIAN*articleID_9537-articles_details.html " 'Tot ce ne-nconjoară e un instrument muzical'. Interviu cu Mircea Florian"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 193, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; He also played at the [[Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism|Ion Mincu University]] hangout, ''Club A'', in live concerts with Vintilă and actor-singer [[Florian Pittiş]]. The coincidence of names with the latter was a running joke, and it was here that he began using the stage name ''Florian din Transilvania'' (literally, "Florian from [[Transylvania]]").&lt;ref name="cdmfecunoi"&gt;{{ro icon}} Claudia Daboveanu, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/campaniile-jurnalul/folk-you/mircea-florian-e-cu-noi-38513.html "Mircea Florian e cu noi"], in ''[[Jurnalul Naţional]]'', August 26, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It has endured as one of the singer's main pseudonyms, alongside ''M. A. N. Florian''.&lt;ref name="mpbanda"/&gt;

His focus was on playing string instruments such as guitar or ''[[cobza]]'', as well as being a singer-songwriter. He established a concept-band, known initially as ''Florian în Labirint'' ("Florian in the Labyrinth"), and later as ''Ceata de dubaşi, ceteraşi, kitarozi şi alţi meşteri lăutari'' ("A Band of Drummers, [[Cittern]]-players, Guitarists and Other Master ''[[Lăutari]]''"), and also involving [[Gabi Căciulă]] and [[Sorin Chifiriuc]] as guitarists and Alexandru Beno as violinist.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; The project broke musical ground when it added [[Music of India|Indian influences]] and [[sitar]] backing, which was contributed by [[Ljubiša Ristić]], of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; The occasional [[tabla]] rhythm and [[flute]] melodies were played by a [[Pakistan]]i performer, Arif Djafri.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;

The music was described by Florian as combining "archaic and [[Electric instrument|electric]] elements" into "a science",&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; and covering successive colored "periods" in his creative history, when he was into amassing musical instruments.&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt; The new Western inspirations on his work were [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Todd Rundgren]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; Emerging from the core group of ''Florian în Labirint'', ''[[Ceata Melopoică]]'' ("The Melo-poetic Band") became Florian's main project of the 1970s. Its often-changing membership included: Beno, Căciulă, Chifiriuc, Ristić, Zaharia, [[Andrei Oişteanu]], [[Alexandru Beno]], [[Valentin Andronescu]], [[Günther Reininger]], [[Andrei Cristea (musician)|Andrei Cristea]], [[Eugen Gondi]], [[Dietrich Krauser]], [[Mihai Creţu]], [[Costin Petrescu (musician)|Costin Petrescu]], [[Alexandru Mitaru]], [[Alexe Conta]], [[Mircea Dordoi]], [[Ortansa Păun]], [[Sorin Baroţi]], [[Gheorghe Popescu (musician)|Gheorghe Popescu]] and [[Mihai Pintilie]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"&gt;{{ro icon}} Vlad Radovan, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/mircea-florian-tot-ce-fac-este-pentru-initiati-nu-cer-ceva-special-147362/ "Mircea Florian: Tot ce fac este pentru iniţiaţi. Nu cer ceva special"], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', May 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

From its choice of name, this new project also reflected its leader's mounting interest in [[Ancient Greek philosophy]], the ideological source of his [[Psychedelic folk|psych-folk]], which he describes as more profound than generic folk rock.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; He referred to his earlier folk songs as "singable" and "more accessible" than his later work.&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; Although psychedelic music was not well seen in Communist Romania in the 1970s, Florian's psych-folk earned a cult following. According to critic Mihai Plămădeală, there was a transition at the end of which Florian became "one of the most peculiar Romanian musicians": "While he started his career as a folk-singer, with several calm and usual songs, Florian slowly began to get distance from standard means of expression."&lt;ref name="mptainicul"&gt;Mihai Plămădeală, Horia Diaconescu, [http://www.muzicisifaze.com/trupa.php?cat=1&amp;id=31&amp;alb=37&amp;lang=en "''Tainicul vîrtej''"], ''Muzici şi Faze'', February 11, 2003; retrieved September 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protest singer===
There was a political aspect to Florian's reputation. He later spoke about the cultural shock at the end of liberalization, when the ''[[July Theses]]'' introduced [[People's Republic of China|Sino]]-[[North Korea]]n-style state control.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; As noted by critic [[Marius Chivu]], Florian's opposition to the communist regime led him into "the great quad of folk [[Protest song|protest singers]]", with [[Nicu Vladimir]], [[Valeriu Sterian]] and [[Horia Stoicanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Marius Chivu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/carte/articol/o-legenda-folkului "O legendă a folkului"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 357, December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, he was a presence at ''[[Cenaclul Flacăra]]'', the folk-singing club organized with communist approval. The singer later stated that he was one of the club's founding members, together with poet [[Adrian Păunescu]], his colleague at ''Luceafărul'', and that he intended to create "a movement to bring together people interested in poetry and music."&lt;ref name="llpaunescu"/&gt;

In the end, Florian was thrown out for performing songs punctuated with [[double entendre]]s.&lt;ref name="mparipile"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Plămădeală, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ARTE-VIZUALE.-Aripile-negre-ale-lui-Mircea-Florian*articleID_25685-articles_details.html "Aripile negre ale lui Mircea Florian"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 585, July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Literary critic and folk music fan [[Dan C. Mihăilescu]] suggests that these disagreements reflected a larger cultural conflict. He describes Florian, [[Marcela Saftiuc]], Sterian and Zaharia as fundamentally different from the "[[Maoism|Maoist]]" agenda of Romanian communism, and notes that they also became irreconcilable with Păunescu when the latter committed himself to "embarrassing" indoctrination.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dan C. Mihăilescu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/carte/articol/voia-mea-adrian-paunescu "Fără voia mea, despre Adrian Păunescu"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 353, November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting back on his childhood attendance of ''Cenaclul'', writer-politician [[Varujan Vosganian]] noted a similar issue: "I liked Marcela Saftiuc, [...] Mircea Florian, Doru Stănculescu and many others, I did not like it when we were made to stand up clapping and chanting."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romlit.ro/adrian_punescu2 "In memoriam Adrian Păunescu"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 43/2010&lt;/ref&gt; As asserted by literary critic [[Ion Bogdan Lefter]], "Few authentic artists of the [folk] genre could prevent its rapid absorption into the melodious, lyricaloid and often jingoistic kitsch promoted by the propagandistic ''Cenaclul Flacăra''."&lt;ref name="iblmultim"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Bogdan Lefter]], [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/65_viata-romaneasca-nr-3-4-2010/4_viata-literaturii/585_cit-de-multimedia-poate-deveni-literatura.html "Cît de 'multimedia' poate deveni literatura?"], in ''[[Viaţa Românească]]'', Nr. 3-4/2010&lt;/ref&gt; Florian's account mentions the "controlled diversions" of such ventures, adding that the "real folk" of the 1970s was lost to indoctrination and commercialization.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

Florian recalls that his lyrics, and especially his long-haired looks, were a growing cause for irritation among [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censors]], and that as a consequence he devised various "strategies" for getting his message across to the public.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; He also explained: "In general the text that was very trenchant stood no chance—they would pick you up then and there and out you were [...]. But everybody would metaphorize. One would get what it was all about from the text, but the most important bit was the state of mind, the attitude sent out by the author, by the artist... [...] Very often [my] message was a simple one: I refused enrollment, I refused that social formula, I would not let myself be lied to and I would let the public know that, I called for 'general cleanup' actions, I also expressed my position on the fact that freedom had been taken away from me. That was fundamental."&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

Florian and Zaharia had a friendly relationship with writer [[Dorin Tudoran]], who was in the process of becoming an outspoken [[dissident]]. According to Tudoran, it was around 1974 when the three of them first became aware that agents of the [[Securitate]] secret police were keeping them under surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Rodica Palade, [[Dorin Tudoran]], [http://www.revista22.ro/turn259toria-ca-voca355ie-irepresibil259-i-9216.html "Turnătoria ca vocaţie irepresibilă (I)"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 1077, October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ceata'' member Andrei Oişteanu, who made his career in religious studies, also noted that the Securitate was at the time closing in on himself and other non-conformists or hippies.&lt;ref name="aorasuplansu1"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Oişteanu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/rasu-plansu-i-574.html "Râsu'-Plânsu' (I)"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 702, August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Florian's solo music was included on the 1973 [[Split album|split EP]] ''Muzică folk'' ("Folk Music"), which he shared with Saftiuc,&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; then, in 1975, on the [[Single (music)|single]] ''Pădure liniştitoare/La făgădău' de piatră/Cu pleoapa de argint'' ("Quieting Forest/At the Stone Tavern/With the Silver Eyelid"). The songs, recorded with Chifiriuc, Reininger and Căciulă, were based on texts written by Florian or selected from Romanian folklore, particularly [[hajduk]] songs. The instrumental arrangement comprised a wide assortment of instruments: [[acoustic guitar]], flute, drum kit, ''cobza'', [[jaw harp]], [[idiophone]]s (all played by Florian himself), alongside [[electric guitar]], tabla, [[conga]], [[electric piano]], [[celesta]], [[synthesizer]] and [[electronic organ]].&lt;ref name="mppadure"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Plămădeală, [http://www.muzicisifaze.com/trupa.php?id=238&amp;cat=1 "''Pădure liniştitoare/La făgădău' de piatră/Cu pleoapa de argint''"], ''Muzici şi Faze'', September 5, 2005; retrieved September 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Mihai Plămădeală describes the result as a unique project in [[Music of Romania|Romanian music]]: "Nothing of what can be listened to or heard on it finds a direct correspondent in anything that anyone, anywhere, has achieved."&lt;ref name="mppadure"/&gt; He notes Florian's fusion of "hippie culture", "[[mantra]]" singing and the "maximal liberty of [[progressive rock]]".&lt;ref name="mppadure"/&gt; Reputedly, Florian remains the first Romanian singer to have employed the synthesizer in one of their works.&lt;ref name="smmeola"&gt;{{ro icon}} Sebastian Mihalcea, [http://www1.romanialibera.ro/index.php?section=articol&amp;screen=print&amp;id=47996&amp;page=0&amp;order=0&amp;redactie=0 "Al di Meola şi-a vrăjit ascultătorii la Festivalul multicultural PLAI"], in ''[[România Liberă]]'', September 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Florian continued with live performances, including the concert of [[Orăştioara de Sus]], where he went on stage alongside Transsylvania Phoenix and the traditionalist drumming band of [[Făget|Brăneşti]], performing what Florian calls "unfiltered, clean, unprocessed music."&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt; Like Nicu Vladimir, he gave concerts at the "fires on the beach" gatherings in the remote [[Romanian Black Sea resorts|Black Sea resort]] of [[2 Mai]], a hippie hotspot, before such events were altogether banned on grounds of border security.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mircea Kivu, [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/tema-saptamanii/articol/capital-social-inainte-si-dupa "Capital social, înainte şi după"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 233, July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He also provided the music to Oişteanu's play ''Vlacea, regele nebun'' ("Mad King Vlacea"), performed on tour by the [[Ţăndărică Theater]], and reportedly poking fun at the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] leader [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]].&lt;ref name="aorasuplansu1"/&gt; Florian later made an appearance as actor-pupeteer and multi-instrumentalist performer in ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'', directed by [[Cătălina Buzoianu]] for Ţăndărică. As he recalls, this involved him playing some 30 or 40 instruments in quick succession, from celesta, [[sackbut]] and [[melodica]] to guitar; Florian does not consider himself a consummate player of all such instruments: "it's like painting and needing some yellow just for a tiny highlight. You can't say you've painted in yellow."&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

''Pădure...'' was followed in 1977 by another single, ''Fîntîna'' ("The Well").&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; An [[electronic rock]] product, it included a collaboration with rock drummer Radu Răducanu.&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; In 1979, Florian was included on a compilation album, also titled ''Muzică folk''.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; However, most of the music he composed and produced at that stage went unrecorded, or was only preserved on [[fidelipac]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; As noted by his former promoter [[Florin Silviu Ursulescu]], who was working for the [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Radio Company]], his supervisors had simply banned some of Florian's songs for containing what they called "inane lyrics".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Tudor Călin Zărojanu, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/80-de-ani-in-eter-3387201 "80 de ani în eter"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', October 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalism and new wave===
Over the following period, Florian became more interested in [[electronic music]], familiarizing himself with new technologies while working as an engineer for the Computer Science Institute, Bucharest.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; He also had access to the recordings kept in the Radu Stan collection at the [[National Library of Romania|State Central Library]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; According to his own reference system, this inaugurated a "green period".&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt; Beyond the early pop influences, Florian was increasingly inspired by the classics of electronic, [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric]] or [[minimal music]]: [[Léon Theremin]], [[Pierre Schaeffer]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Morton Subotnick]], [[Lejaren Hiller]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[John Cage]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;

With collaborators Belu Alexandru and Valentin Antonescu, he tested minimalist recordings on [[magnetic tape]], glued into various sequences.&lt;ref name="mpbanda"/&gt; Florian also composed and, with the help of Transsylvania Phoenix drummer [[Costin Petrescu (musician)|Costin Petrescu]], recorded the [[experimental rock]] song ''Nicodim şi toaca ascunsă'' ("Nicodim and the Hidden [[Semantron]]"), which was visually supported by Florian's performance art and reworked on a [[music sequencer]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; The musical pieces were played at Florian's exhibits, including his contribution to the major multimaedia show ''Scrierea'' ("Writing"), or in special "new music" concerts held in classical concert halls such as the [[Romanian Atheneum]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; His other activity as a multimedia artist was in [[biomusic]]: in 1976, Kalinderu Palace hosted his live study, ''Corpul uman'' ("The Human Body"), during which he mixed the body resonance of one friend into a musical arrangement.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;

In reference to this phase, Lefter includes Florian among the young men who reached out of the folk and hippie scenes and into the field of multimedia experiments, in what was largely an attempt to circumvent the official art of communism. This "pre-[[Postmodernism|postmodern]]" transition, Lefter notes, was also affected by the [[Sfinx (band)|Sfinx]], Transsylvania Phoenix, "the weird" Dorin Zaharia and Nicu Vladimir, but Florian's work remained the "most interesting".&lt;ref name="iblmultim"/&gt; Florian, who first began introducing himself as an "[[Intermedia|InterMedia artist]]" during the 1970s,&lt;ref name="mpbanda"/&gt; collaborated with draftsman Anton Petraşincu, who created the first [[Opaque projector|opaque projections]] to go with Florian's live singing.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

By 1977, Florian's interest in [[electronic musical instrument]]s, particularly synthesizers, created splits within ''Ceata Melopoică'', which was also affected by some of its members' decisions to emigrate.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; In the early 1980s, Florian was again interested in setting up a classic rock band, but also sought to preserve the trademark combination of folklore and electronics.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; He switched to [[new wave music]], with his new band ''Florian din Transilvania''; among his new wave and electronic influences, Florian called to mind [[David Byrne]], [[Brian Eno]]&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; and [[Depeche Mode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Marius Chivu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/la-zi-cultura/articol/dilemeche-mode "Dilemeche Mode"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 118, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting back on this time, he spoke of Sfinx's [[Dan Andrei Aldea]] as the "saint" of Romanian electronic music, one "more important than anyone else" on this scene.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

The group only released one album, the 1986 [[Gramophone record|vinyl-edition]] ''Tainicul vîrtej'' ("The Secret Swirl"), with the state-run recording company [[Electrecord]].&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mptainicul"/&gt; The lyricist and composer Florian did most of the vocals, and played ''cobza'', guitar and synthesizer. The other members of the team came from various Romanian rock and pop acts: Andronescu was on keyboards, [[Doru Căplescu]] on additional synthesizer, [[Dan Cimpoieru]] on second guitar, [[Doru Istudor]] on drums, [[Zsolt Kerestely]] on [[electronic drum]]s, with [[Mircea Baniciu]] providing backing vocals and [[Mihaela Hoaja]] the violin parts.&lt;ref name="mptainicul"/&gt; Reportedly, the record went through the hands of official censors before being released, and Florian's song ''Madama Butterfly'' had to be discarded, leaving space for other songs such as ''Nunta lui Harap Alb'' ("[[Harap Alb]]'s Wedding").&lt;ref name="mptainicul"/&gt; The song ''AS'' ("Ace"), also included on the album, was altogether banned after the Electrecord producers picked up on its political hints.&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

Plămădeală argues that ''Tainicul vîrtej'' follows its composer's "metaphysical" inclination, being notable for its "shock element",&lt;ref name="mptainicul"/&gt; while journalist and musician Maria Balabaş describes the record as "psychedelic" with an "electronic sound".&lt;ref name="mbferit"&gt;{{ro icon}} Maria Balabaş, [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/muzica/articol/ferit-intemperii "Ferit de intemperii"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 377, May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to its author, it should also be seen as "intellectualized" and "elitist", but not in fact a "hiatus" in his artistic development.&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; Florian additionally argued that, from "stupor", the public's reaction to his compositions became "very positive, even enthusiastic."&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

Although short-lived, the act became known on the underground scene for both its music and the [[conceptual art]] of its live performances, drawing comparisons with [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Popol Vuh (German band)|Popol Vuh]] and the [[Third Ear Band]]; during such events, Florian would appear dressed up in a [[hazmat suit]].&lt;ref name="mptainicul"/&gt; Florian and his collaborators toured the country, and were awarded the first prize at the ''Constelaţii rock'' event in [[Râmnicu Vâlcea]].&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; ''Tainicul vîrtej'' also led to shows at various underground venues, from [[Stelian Tănase]]'s rock evenings at the [[Constantin Tănase Revue Theater|Revue Theater]] to the [[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|State Jewish Theater]] stage and [[Arenele Romane]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

The artist was several times invited to exhibit his work outside Romania, and even beyond the [[Iron Curtain]], receiving a scholarship from the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] and attending the ''[[Darmstädter Ferienkurse]]'', where he worked under Stockhausen's supervision.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; In 1982, he was among those collaborating with the ''[[Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk]]'' studio of electronic music, in [[Cologne]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; His concerts abroad were probably the reason why his ''Tainicul vîrtej'' was never on general release: the communist government allegedly presumed that he would not be returning, and tried to prevent the public from glorifying his departure.&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt; Florian accuses Electrecord of having mismanaged the distribution, by not printing sufficient copies and by oversupplying shops located outside Bucharest.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

===Defection and return===
Mircea Florian continued his work in other media, joining with the ''SubReal'' performance artists, with whom he staged a 1986 event in the city of [[Sibiu]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; He notes having been increasingly frustrated by censorship, which prevented him from participating in some exhibits and concerts, and eventually pondering about leaving the country.&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt;

After receiving a visa for the [[United States]], where he had been invited to present his [[sound installation]]s, he [[Defector|defected]] and later settled down in [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; He changed residence between the cities of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]: [[Mettmann]], [[Wuppertal]], [[Düsseldorf]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; He decided not to work as a musician, because he could only conceive of singing in his native [[Romanian language]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;

Florian focused on his work as an artist and computer scientist.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; Since the late 1980s he has been combining visual arts with music to create [[sound sculpture]]s, [[sound installation]]s, and [[collage]]s. By 2009, his work had received some 21 awards, including, alongside Romanian ones, German, [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Japan]]ese distinctions.&lt;ref name="mpbanda"/&gt; He was present with his work at the [[Venice Biennale]] of 1999,&lt;ref name="mpbanda"/&gt; and managed a Romanian festival in Wuppertal.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Aurelia Mocanu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ARTE-VIZUALE.-%C4%B9%C5%BEeptar-norocos-pe-Ruhr*articleID_24625-articles_details.html "Şeptar norocos pe Ruhr"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 552, November 2010; [[Cezar Paul-Bădescu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/din-polul-plus/articol/romania-compozitorului-german "România compozitorului german"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 98, December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Florian has resumed his collaboration with Romanian artists, including [[Nicu Covaci]]: in 1992, he wrote the title song on Covaci's "Symphoenix" album ''Timişoara''.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; Also in 1992, he participated in setting up ''Deutsch-Rumänische Kulturbegegnungen'' ("German-Romanian Cultural Encounters", or DeR KuB), a cultural society dedicated to cooperation between artists; its Romanian branch is the ''Mircea Florian Association''.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; Two years later, some of his work was reissued on the ''Club A'' compilation.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; Florian also contributed the preface to Vlad Arghir's book, the first Romanian-language monograph on [[Leonard Cohen]], published in Hungary by [[Pont Kiadó]].&lt;ref name="ficohen"&gt;{{ro icon}} Florin Irimia, [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=6661 "Leonard Cohen, cartonat"], in ''aLtitudini'', Nr. 1/2006 (republished by [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Florian and DeR KuB have organized several events reuniting Romanian folkloric ensembles from [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]] and [[Ukraine]] with bands representing the various traditions of [[Minorities of Romania|minority groups in Romania]].&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; He personally spent a week in Satu Mare Prison, coaching the detainees' own musical project, and created portrait projection shows in Satu Mare and [[Bratislava]].&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; In addition to opening for Phoenix and Covaci at reunion concerts in 2003,&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt; Florian has performed with the [[Shukar Collective]] project, which mixes electronic music with [[Romani music|Romani tradition]]. He and Shukar's DJ Vasile remixed several ''[[Ursari]]'' renditions of old songs, "some five out of eleven" entries on the Collective's album, and including the single ''Anna e Manole''.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; He intended to continue work with this group, but it disbanded following lead singer Tamango's illness.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;

Florian's performance art was showcased in exhibits at the [[National Theater Bucharest]], the International Center for Contemporary Art, the [[Technical University of Cluj-Napoca|Cluj-Napoca Technical College]] etc.&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt; In addition, he was [[visiting scholar]] at the [[Caragiale Academy of Theatrical Arts and Cinematography]] and [[Babeş-Bolyai University]].&lt;ref name="mpbanda"/&gt; Florian was also invited to sing at the ''Stufstock'' event of [[Vama Veche]], in 2004, but refused to perform on stage, and gave an impromptu concert on one of the side alleys, in hopes of addressing only his real fans.&lt;ref name="cdmfecunoi"/&gt; Florian was later a guest at ''Festivalul Plai'', a multicultural music event held in [[Timişoara]] city.&lt;ref name="smmeola"/&gt; He also returned to attend the [[Gărâna Jazz Festival]],&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; and tried to set up his own [[world music]] festival project, in [[Certeze]].&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; His presences at ''Folk You!'' in Vama Veche were included on the festival's "best of" compilation for 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Dana Andronie, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/jurnalul-national/jurnalul-national/marturia-faptelor-316194.html "Mărturia faptelor"], in ''[[Jurnalul Naţional]]'', August 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, after polling the Romanian music critics, ''Sunete'' magazine ranked Florian the 11th most important musician in the country's pop history.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Alex Revenco, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/cultura/arte-vizuale/under-more-113700.html "Under &amp; more"], in ''[[Jurnalul Naţional]]'', January 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later projects===
Florian composed the musical score to [[Ioan Cărmăzan]]'s drama film ''[[Margo (2006 film)|Margo]]'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Iulia Blaga, [http://agenda.liternet.ro/articol/3229/Iulia-Blaga/Fericirea-nu-tine-cont-de-marimea-sinilor-Margo.html "Fericirea nu ţine cont de mărimea sînilor!"], [[Editura LiterNet]] (originally published in ''[[România Liberă]]'', September 2006); retrieved September 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="agunul/an"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Gorzo]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/tilc-show/articol/unul-pe "Unul pe an"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 137, September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Like the film itself, his contribution received strong criticism from film critic [[Andrei Gorzo]]: "Margo travels a lot by train, then walks even more, [...] forever accompanied by the chirps, electronic farts and [[spaghetti western]] ding-dongs in Mircea Florian's music."&lt;ref name="agunul/an"/&gt; Florian was later the composer of music for [[Alexandru Solomon]]'s political documentary ''[[Kapitalism: Our Improved Formula]]'' (2010). It was received with interest by film journalist Mihai Fulger, who described Solomon as a "trendsetter", for attaching Florian's original music to animation and archive footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Fulger, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Kapitalism-si-cinema-%28VIDEO%29*articleID_23563-articles_details.html "Kapitalism şi cinema"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 521, April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Florian's contribution was nominated for the [[Gopo Awards]] of 2011, in the "Best Original Music in Short Film" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.mediafax.ro/cultura-media/premiile-gopo-2011-vezi-aici-lista-completa-a-nominalizarilor-8001016/ "Premiile Gopo 2011: Vezi aici lista completă a nominalizărilor"], [[Mediafax]] release, February 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

He was additionally working with [[Cătălina Buzoianu]], arranging the music to her various productions, including a 2005 version of [[August Strindberg]]'s ''[[The Father (Strindberg)|Father]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Valentin Dumitrescu, [http://www.revista22.ro/autor-valentin-dumitrescu-4 "Unicul şi multiplul"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 774, January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2008 staging of [[Mircea Cărtărescu]]'s ''Dream''. Theater manager and poet Ion Cocora was impressed by the latter show and its "fairy tale state", describing Florian's music as "a continuous oscillation between the real and the unreal."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Cocora, [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=417&amp;editie=24 "Visul lui Mircea Cărtărescu şi al Cătălinei Buzoianu"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 20/2008&lt;/ref&gt; Theater critic Alice Georgescu also described Florian's music for ''Dream'' as "felicitously reusing childish rhymes".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Alice Georgescu, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/jocurile-amintirii-3057828 "Jocurile amintirii"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', December 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The collaborative project was later taken up for the 2009 productions of [[Matei Vişniec]]'s ''Joan and the Fire'' and ''We're Banning Richard III'' ([[Bulandra Theater]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/TEATRU*articleID_21239-articles_details.html "Teatru"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 461, February 2009; [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/TEATRU*articleID_22451-articles_details.html "Teatru"], in ''Observator Cultural'', Nr. 492, September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to the 2010 adaptation of [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]'s ''[[The Magician of Lublin (novel)|The Magician of Lublin]]'' ([[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|State Jewish Theater]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/TEATRU*articleID_23259-articles_details.html "Teatru"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 513, February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2007, Florian's work in art again centered on magnetic tape, used in collages and sound sculptures. One example is his work ''The Last Supper'', exhibited in [[Berlin]]: it is a combination of three [[analog recording]]s, on different colors of tape, played in unison.&lt;ref name="mpbanda"/&gt; His work in Romania covered graphic art, and he designed the layout to the cultural review ''aLtitudini''.&lt;ref name="ficohen"/&gt; Some of his other projects again bridged avant-garde jazz and literature. Around 2004, he toured with novelist [[Gheorghe Crăciun]], who was promoting his book ''Pupa Russa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Vitalie Ciobanu]], [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=415 "Evocare Gheorghe Crăciun"], in ''[[Contrafort]]'', Nr. 1-3/2007 (republished by [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }})&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he resumed his work with [[Valery Oisteanu]], upon the latter's return from the United States. Their mix of Surrealism and electronic music was hosted by the ''Green Hours'' pub, in Bucharest.&lt;ref name="psvalery"/&gt;

While experimenting with a new generation of [[electronica]] gear ([[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[Ableton Live]] and [[Max (software)|Max]] programs, [[Korg]] adapters etc.), Florian still saw string instruments as his first love, and noted that he had also begun playing the [[guitalele]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; In February 2011, Florian, DJ Vasile and their new music project, ''FloriMan'', performed live at the ''Cinema Total'', part of the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlinale festivities]].

In June, the [[Vasile Goldiş West University of Arad|Vasile Goldiş West University]] made Florian an ''[[honoris causa]]'' doctor.&lt;ref name="floriandoctor"/&gt; The same year, he returned to Romania with a re-release of ''Tainicul vîrtej'' as a Bucharest musical show, part of the Club A Festival,&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; and a personal exhibit at the Bucharest Municipal Art Galleries, ''Negrele-mi aripi'' ("Black My Wings"), turned into a film directed by fellow artist Victor Velculescu. It recorded Florian's installations, which comprised brushes, a [[laptop]], an [[oscilloscope]] and other instruments, creating the illusion of a winged figure attached to his body.&lt;ref name="mparipile"/&gt; Also in 2011, the [[alternative rock]] act [[byron (band)|byron]] covered one of his ''Tainicul vîrtej'' songs on their own album ''Perfect''.&lt;ref name="mbferit"/&gt;

Dame '''Nellie Robinson''', '''DC''', '''MBE''' (1880-1972) was an [[Antigua]]n teacher and school founder who was a pioneer in education. She broke down color and class barriers believing all children should have access to learning. As of 2017, she was the only woman to have received the [[Order of the National Hero (Antigua and Barbuda)|Order of the National Hero]] from the government of [[Antigua and Barbuda]].

==Early life==
Georgiana Ellen Robinson was born on 7 December 1880 in [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|St. John’s]] on the island of [[Antigua]] in the [[West Indies]] to Margaret and George Robinson.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} As the second of eight children, she was raised in the family home on Newgate Street in St John's,{{sfn|TOR Memorial School|2008}} until the age of around ten, when she was sent to the United States to study in the American school system. By age thirteen, she was acting as a household helper and [[nanny]] and the following year, she returned to Antigua. To further her education, Robinson enrolled in Coke Memorial College. Though it was a Methodist school and Robinson was Anglican, Coke allowed students of [[Afro-Antiguan and Barbudan|African heritage]], which the elite Anglican schools prohibited, unless the children were of the elite upper class.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}}{{sfn|TOR Memorial School|2008}} The school was only operational for about a decade due to the lack of funding available, since the government only provided funds for the Anglican schools.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} When Coke closed, Robinson pursued education on her own, studying for her [[Senior Cambridge]] examination with Mr. D. S. B, Jones. She passed her examination and furthered her studies, obtaining certificates in music and music theory with Mrs. Lamond (née Tull).{{sfn|Quinn|28 September 2010}}

==Career==
When Robinson completed her schooling, she was determined to improve the educational opportunities of black students.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} Her brother, Thomas Oliver Robinson, suggested she found a school herself.{{sfn|Quinn|28 September 2010}} She did so, and named it in remembrance him, as he had recently died of [[typhoid fever]].{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} In 1898, when she was eighteen, Robinson opened the [[Thomas Oliver Robinson Memorial School]] (most often known as TOR or TOR Memorial) for children of all [[Race (human categorization)|race]]s,{{sfn|Spencer|2010}}{{sfn|Johnson|2010}} classes, and faiths—her doors were open to anyone desiring to improve their education and life. In a pioneering move for the time, Robinson admitted [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate children]] and lobbied for the change of official practice barring illegitimate children from secondary school.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}}{{sfn|TOR Memorial School|2008}} She established the first coeducational secondary school on the island, successfully challenging the officials which tried to close her school by claiming the teachers were unqualified and that the conditions were unsanitary.{{sfn|TOR Memorial School|2008}}

In the beginning, most of her students were [[mulatto]]s because most blacks could not afford schooling. Only forty years had lapsed since slavery was [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolished]]{{sfn|Quinn|28 September 2010}} and [[British colonialism]] imposed class and race inequalities upon [[people of color|people of non-white]] backgrounds.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} As soon as she was financially able to do so, Robinson began funding scholarships for poor, black children. TOR Memorial students were encouraged in both intellectual and artistic pursuits, and the school staged entertainment such as [[musicals]] and [[operettas]]. As the reputation of the school became known, enrollment increased and soon Robinson's classes represented the social spectrum of the country. Sir [[Ernest Bickham Sweet-Escott]] recommended that Robinson be given a grant to further the school's educational aims.{{sfn|Quinn|28 September 2010}}

In 1912, Robinson served on the Water Preservation Committee, formed to expand the access to [[Water supply network|piped water]] in the country.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} In 1915, during [[World War I]], Robinson was the only black woman to serve on the Antiguan [[Mobilization#Mobilization in World War I|Mobilization Committee]]. Robinson recruited men to travel to Canada or Britain to enlist, but also lobbied for improvements in the living conditions for men being shipped overseas for service.{{sfn|Foreign and Commonwealth Office|n.d.|p=2}} She was one of the people who helped establish [[The Girl Guides Association of Antigua and Barbuda]] and served as a committee member of the association. In 1935, she was given a commemorative medal at the [[Silver Jubilee]] of [[King George V]] in recognition of her contributions to education and in 1941 she was honored as a Member of [[Order of the British Empire]].{{sfn|TOR Memorial School|2008}} 

In 1950, after having served over sixty years as headmistress of TOR Memorial, Robinson retired, leaving the running of the school to Ina Loving.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1972|p=20}}{{sfn|Quinn|12 October 2010}} She continued to be active, encouraging participation in cultural activities and in the 1950s supported the development of [[Antigua Carnival]].{{sfn|Quinn|5 October 2010}}

==Death and legacy==
Robinson died on 29 April 1972 in St. John's{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} and was buried at the St John’s Public Cemetery.{{sfn|''The Daily Observer''|2011}} Her funeral was attended by the [[Governor-General of Antigua and Barbuda|Governor-General]] Sir [[Wilfred Jacobs]] and the Premier [[George Walter]].{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1972|p=20}} In 1999, a panel organized by the Professional Organization of Women in Antigua reviewing outstanding contributions from women in Antigua and Barbuda, named Robinson as the Outstanding Woman of the Century.{{sfn|Quinn|5 October 2010}}{{sfn|''The Daily Observer''|2013}} In 2006, at the celebrations for Antigua's twenty-fifth independence anniversary, she was named a Dame Companion of the Order of the National Heroes.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} A decade after she was honored, she is the only woman to be declared a national hero and is recognized, along the other designees with an annual wreathe–laying on their graves.{{sfn|Hillhouse|2011}}{{sfn|''The Daily Observer''|2016}}

'''Non Violent Resistance''' (NVR) is a psychological approach for overcoming destructive, aggressive, controlling and risk-taking behaviour. It was originally developed to address serious behaviour problems in young people, although it is now also being utilised in many different areas, such as adult entitled dependence, anxiety-related problems, problems linked to paediatric illness, internet dependency and misuse, and domestic violence perpetrated by adults.

Empirical research is on-going and relatively new. However, the outcome studies carried out so far has shown it to be effective for reducing childhood violence and aggression, improved relationships within the family, as well as increasing parents’ confidence levels and improving parental mental health.

NVR's principles are based on the socio-political practice of [[nonviolent resistance]] (or [[nonviolent action]]), which refers to achieving goals through nonviolent methods, such as [[symbolic protests]], [[civil disobedience]], and economic or political noncooperation.  The modern leading father of nonviolent resistance as a form of political struggle is [[Mahatma Gandhi]], the Indian leader who used peaceful protests to seek independence from the British. NVR draws upon the approaches used by Gandhi &lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, A. (2004). Nonviolence as a comprehensive philosophy. Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 10: 87-90.&lt;/ref&gt; to develop interventions aimed at the violent or self-destructive behaviour of young people who act in controlling ways. More recently, the practice of NVR has spawned the concept of the “anchoring function of attachment”, a contribution to attachment theory which emphasises the child's need to become secure in the relationship with a ‘strong and wise adult’,&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, J. (1982). Attachment and loss: retrospect and prospect. [[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]], 52, 664–678.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the conceptualisation of the “New Authority”, which is based on principles such as transparency, inter-personal closeness, accountability of the adult within the community, rather than the principles of positional power, hierarchy and distance which marked more traditional forms of authority.

==Description==

As a therapeutic or coaching process, NVR involves the individual's family, and generally extends to include family friends, professionals, schools and members of the community in its network. The approach believes parents, carers or teachers overcome their isolation by adopting such a large support network, and drawing on interpersonal support. A course of NVR lasts for about 3 months, or longer in more serious cases.  Parents or carers of the aggressive young person typically attend one session with an NVR practitioner weekly, and may receive additional support such as telephone calls 1-2 times a week initially, gradually reducing as the intervention progresses. The violent child does not have to participate; NVR has been designed specifically to help families in which a young person does not cooperate in the therapeutic process. It is thought that the parents’ perseverance in the face of the child's non-cooperation sends a message of resistance.

The purposes of NVR is to help adults develop a positive form of authority, develop effective, non-punitive strategies of addressing the young person's [[controlling behaviour]] without escalation, restore a sense of balance in the family, and improve family relationships. NVR is a stable alternative to violent conflict and unproductive attempts at verbal persuasion.

The intervention is used for a variety of aggressive people, including children, adolescents and adults. It is currently used with children in care, children with mental health issues, and people with [[Autistic Spectrum Disorder]] (ASD). The methods are concrete, specific, and are not overly reliant on the spoken word, which is why the approach is offered to families of people with ASD. The techniques can also be easily adapted into story boards and other methods, which may help the child understand what changes are being made to resist their behaviour.

===The Principles and Aims of NVR===

The intervention is based on a number of principles and assumptions. Most young people who act in defiant, aggressive or violent ways do this to control others around them.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., and Seligman, M.E. (1983). Learned Helplessness and Victimization. Journal of Social Issues, 39, 103-116.&lt;/ref&gt; A key element of NVR is an understanding of the concept of ‘parental (or adult) presence.’ This refers to an awareness of the person of the parent and their authority at home, in school, and when the child is with their peers. It also includes parents not being pushed aside, and regaining their parental space in the family unit. Practitioners find that parents of violent children often feel helpless and isolated, and claim this is largely due to a lowered parental presence. NVR aims to increase the parents’ presence in their child's mind, and to reduce the parent's helplessness. One necessary measure in achieving this is the development of an adult support network. This is an essential element in this therapeutic process, where supporters in the network play vital roles, such as mentor, mediator, witness and protector. Some of the other methods for raising parental presence are briefly mentioned in the next section.

Another important principle in NVR is that of a delayed reaction: this refers to ‘striking when the iron is cold,’ or not reacting immediately to a situation, which avoids [[Conflict escalation|escalation]]. Instead, the issue is dealt with later at the resistor's choosing. This gives back power to the parent, and helps them regain parental authority and presence.
Finally, the therapy works on the premise of using action, not words. This is particularly useful when NVR is applied to people with ASD, who struggle with social communication.

The approach endeavours to help parents gain authority. This is achieved through supporting parents to become active in four main areas:

====De-escalation====
De-escalation refers to refusing to be drawn into a battle with the other (escalation). Escalation can be symmetrical &lt;ref&gt;Watzlawick, P., Beavin, J.H., and Jackson, D.D. (1967). Pragmatics of human communication:  a study of interactional patterns, pathologies and paradoxes. W.W.Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; where parent and child each attempt to gain control over the other and raise levels of aggression in an upward spiral, or complementary,&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G.R., Dishion, T.J., and Bank, L. (1984). Family interaction: a process model of deviancy training. Aggressive Behavior, 10: 253-267.&lt;/ref&gt; where parents give in to child demands or the threat of violence or other controlling responses and acquiesce to the child. In each case, the parents are believed to lose more of their authority, and family members are weakened and left more vulnerable. By developing strategies to manage risk with an NVR practitioner, the aim is that parents can build up their authority without getting involved in fruitless power struggles.

====Breaking taboos====

The parents seen in NVR therapy often attempt to “keep the peace” by following rules explicitly or implicitly set in place by their child. It is important to break the rules, in order to resist the violence. Parents therefore learn to break the rules that their child has set up; this ‘parental disobedience,’ is a key principle of the approach.

====Taking non-violent action====

NVR does not rely mainly on punishments or consequences for reducing unacceptable behaviours, but instead on increasing the parents ability to become present and resist aggressive or self-risk behaviours.

====Reconciliation gestures====

Reconciliation gestures play an important role in the therapy process. The purpose of the gestures is to show the young person that their families care for and love them. The gestures are also thought to help the individual and their parents relate to one another beyond the aggression, and reestablish a loving connection.

====Child focus====

It is believed within the NVR field that when young people have experienced physical or sexual child abuse or neglect, their aggressive or dismissive behaviour can mask vulnerability, such as anxiety or fear, and/or an unmet need. Some areas of unmet needs are said to be:

*	The need to feel safe and protected
*	The need to feel a sense of belonging
*	The need to have a coherent and benign self- and family narrative
*	The need for support in one's development.

The child's behavioural problems divert the attention of adult and child away from any unmet need and vulnerability. NVR claims that by raising their own sense of agency and strength in resisting the destructive behaviour, and then using their efforts at reconciliation to address the child's unmet needs, the adults can re-sensitise themselves for the child's distress and re-instate themselves in a caring position.&lt;ref&gt;Jakob, P. (2011). Re-connecting Parents and Young People with Serious Behaviour Problems – Child-Focused Practice and Reconciliation Work in Non Violent Resistance Therapy, found at: [http://www.newauthority.net/data/cntfiles/146_.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Techniques NVR uses===

NVR uses a variety of methods, many of which are outlined in the NVR parents’ manual.&lt;ref&gt;Omer, H. (2004/1). Nonviolent resistance. A new approach to violent and self-destructive children. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The resistance process is developed step by step with the NVR practitioner, in order to increase the parents’, carers’ or teachers’ confidence. Initially, the intervention begins with a written announcement; the therapist or NVR coach/practitioner supports and guides the parents and/or other adults in writing and planning how to carry out the announcement without escalation or engaging in unproductive communication.

A support network is developed by the parents with the aid of a NVR practitioner throughout the process. The aim of this is to help them to remove the secrecy and expose the violence, and help them to feel supported in their actions. The support network also plays a role in carrying out action, such as participating in ‘sit ins,’ where parents and supporters sit in with the child after an aggressive incident and express their expectation that the child will develop a solution to the violence. Parents are encouraged to document acts of violence or self-destructive acts, as well as their own behaviour and responses around these, and to pass this information on to their supporters, in order to enable public accountability for their own and the young person's behaviour.

The supporters also play a role in a ‘campaign of concern’ or ‘message campaign,’ by contacting the young person and expressing their concern for them and others affected by their aggression. This is done to reinforce the parents’ or carers’ message of resistance.

After any demonstration of resistance to the child's aggression, adults use reconciliation gestures to communicate their unconditional care, respect and love for the young person.

Further techniques are the telephone round and tailing, which are used as methods for raising adult presence where young people withdraw from their families into dangerous environments. Parents and other adults use these and other methods, draw upon their inter-personal resources, to effectively resist their child's violence and self-destructive behaviour by raising parental (adult) presence.

==Applications==

NVR can be utilised with a range of difficulties such as anxiety and aggression in young people on the autistic spectrum, [[Obsessive Compulsive Disorder]] (OCD) and other severe anxiety-related problems, when the child does not collaborate in treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Lebowitz, E., &amp; Omer, H. (2013).Treating Childhood and Adolescent Anxiety: A Guide for Caregivers&lt;/ref&gt; NVR is now being used for self-isolation,&lt;ref&gt;Omer, H. (2004/2). Children who take control of the house. In: Nonviolent resistance. A new approach to violent and self-destructive children. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; adult entitled dependency,&lt;ref&gt;Lebowitz, E., Dolberger, D., Nortov, E., &amp; Omer, H. (2012). Parent Training in Nonviolent Resistance for Adult Entitled Dependence. Family Process, 51 (1), 90-106.&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of other problem areas.

Recently NVR has been developed as an intervention in a variety of different settings, such as residential care &lt;ref&gt;Körner, B., and Uschold-Meier, E. (2007). Carer presence in children’s homes. Non Violent Resistance in residential care contexts? (German) in A. von Schlippe and M. Grabbe (Eds.) Werkstattbuch Elterncoaching, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht.&lt;/ref&gt; and foster care (Jakob and van Holen, in process). It is also being developed for other problematic areas, such as [[childhood obesity]] &lt;ref&gt;Eberding, A. and Lemme, M. (2007). Child obesity – parental presence. Coaching in the context of obesity training for children and adolescents. (German) in A. von Schlippe and M. Grabbe (Eds.) Werkstattbuch Elterncoaching, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht.&lt;/ref&gt; and chronic paediatric illness.&lt;ref name="Ollefs"&gt;Ollefs, B., Von Schlippe, A., Omer, H., and Kriz, J. (2009). Adolescents showing externalising problem behaviour. Effects of parent coaching (German). Familiendynamik, 3: 256-265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

NVR is a relatively new intervention amongst other psychological interventions. It was developed by Haim Omer and colleagues at the University of Tel Aviv,&lt;ref&gt;Omer, H. (2001). Helping parents deal with children’s acute disciplinary problems without escalation: the principle of non-violent resistance.  Family Process, 40: 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; to support parents/carers in developing effective resistance against violence.

NVR is widely used in Israel, Germany and a number of other European countries. In the English – speaking world, it has been mainly introduced to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Jakob, P. (2006). Bringing non-violent resistance to Britain. Context, 84, 36-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family therapy roots===

Reviews indicate that systemic and multi-modal approaches are effective in decreasing destructive behaviour in adolescents with behavioural problems.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, A. (2009). The effectiveness of family therapy and systemic interventions for child-focused problems. Journal of Family Therapy, 31: 3-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The NVR approach applies traditions of Systemic (Family) Therapy, involving family members and institutions surrounding the individual in the therapy process, and change is brought about through the interactions between them.

===Other roots===

NVR has its roots in the philosophy and methods of socio-political nonviolent resistance, such as those used by Mahatma Gandhi and [[Martin Luther King]]. Gandhi practised and advocated non-violence when leading protests against those seeking to oppress him and his fellow men and women.  He famously spoke out about non-violently fighting the British without arms, through being peaceful and non-retaliatory. The principle of non-violently resisting a child's controlling behaviour derives from the same ideas and beliefs. Gandhi also promoted solidarity, which is one of the aims the supporters’ network strives to evoke in the parents.

Finally, the stance of de-escalation and refusal to be drawn into conflict can be summed up by a famous quote from Gandhi: “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind”.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, M E. (2009). Encyclopedia of the Literature of Empire, p. 316. New York: Facts on File.&lt;/ref&gt; It is these non-violent beliefs that provided the foundation for NVR.

==Evaluation of Effectiveness==

NVR has an emerging evidence base. A recent study showed that NVR was highly effective at improving the problematic behaviour of a large percentage of young people, with no differences between children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Weinblatt, U. and Omer, H. (2008). Non-violent resistance: a treatment for parents of children with acute behavior problems.  Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, 34: 75-92.&lt;/ref&gt; It was further found that NVR reduced parents’ feelings of helplessness, increased their confidence, and it also improved parental mental health. Parental escalation also decreased within the first four months of the intervention. There was also a very low drop-out rate: over 90% of all families completed the programme.

A study conducted in Germany compared NVR against TEEN Triple-P (a parenting programme for parents of teenagers) and a waiting list group.&lt;ref name="Ollefs" /&gt; It was found that the TEEN triple-P and NVR groups showed significant improvements in parenting behaviour, parental presence, reduced parental depression and helplessness. NVR was superior to TEEN Triple-P in showing significant improvements in the 11- to 18-year-old children's [[externalising behaviour problems]], assessed by Achenbach's.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbach, T. M. (1991). Manual for the Child Behavior Checklist 4‐18 and 1991 profile. Burlington: University of Vermont, Department of Psychiatry.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Child Behaviour Checklist]] (CBCL).

Finally, research has shown an improvement in reduced parental submission, fewer power struggles and improvements in children's behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Lavi-Levavi, I., (2010). Improvement in systemic intra- familial variables by "Non- Violent Resistance" treatment for parents of children and adolescents with behavioral problems, PhD dissertation, Tel- Aviv University, Tel Aviv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, there is a [[Randomized controlled trial]] (RCT) of NVR for looked after children being conducted in Belgium (Opvang).

'''Norbert Brunner''' (born 1969, [[Hohenems]], [[Austria]]) is an Austrian object, [[Conceptual art|conceptual]] and installation artist. Brunner’s mirror objects reflect not only the viewer, but also superimpose messages across their visual path, insisting they become an interactive part of the installation. He studied on the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna]]. Currently Brunner lives and works in [[Vienna]] and [[New York City]].

His works are part of important museum collections like the [[20er Haus|21 Haus]] in Vienna, the [[New Britain Museum of American Art]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://nbmaa.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/contemporary-art-glass-featured-at-the-54th-venice-biennale-at-the-nbmaa/#more-2086] "NBMAA." Norbert Brunner. Contemporary Art Glass Featured at the 54th Venice Biennale. June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vorarlberg museum|Vorarlberger Landesmuseum]].

==Work==

Norbert Brunner's works are meant to inspire for the beholder to get a "broader" attitude of mind. In his objects he translates two dimensional images into a multi-dimensional design. His objects demand that the viewer examines them closely for full visual appreciation and understanding. This spatial interaction with the sculpture is forcing the viewer into a more extensive contention with the artwork. Brunner's mirror objects reflect not only the viewer, but also superimpose written messages. Using few but compelling words, Brunner’s texts reflect infinite possibilities asking us to formulate our own interpretation of reality.

Brunner employs acrylic glass, [[Swarovski]] crystal, mirror, photographic prints, paint, and foil in his creations that range in size from personal and intimate to monumental and communal. In his objects he defines the dot as the lowest common denominator. Everything consists of these dots, which are located next or above one another and make up the image. 
By putting foil dots on several layers of acrylic glass and mirrors he arranges layers in a sandwich system. When the viewer changes his position towards the object these images dissolve into many individual parts and reassemble only when seen from the right angle.

Brunner is always dreaming up new techniques and mediums to employ new means of "communication". As source material for his works, Brunner uses well-known objects or texts from everyday life which are universally familiar. They become his vocabulary of global communication with the aim to reach as many people as possible.

[[File:U.S. 30 in Center Township.jpg|right|thumb|Open fields near [[Lisbon, Ohio|Lisbon, OH]].|alt=Rolling countryside with fields, some cultivated, others not. There is a small house at the left center.]]
The '''open-fields doctrine''' (also '''open-field doctrine''' or '''open-fields rule'''), in the [[U.S. law]] of [[criminal procedure]], is the [[legal doctrine]] that a "[[warrantless search]] of the area outside a [[property]] owner's [[curtilage]]" does not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (9th ed. 2009), open-fields doctrine&lt;/ref&gt; However, "unless there is some other legal basis for the search," such a search "must exclude the home and any adjoining land (such as a yard) that is within an enclosure or otherwise protected from public scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'' (9th ed. 2009), open-fields doctrine&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The open fields doctrine was first articulated by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Hester v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hester v. U.S.]]'', 265 U.S. 57 (1924)&lt;/ref&gt; which stated that "the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to the people in their 'persons, houses, papers, and effects,' is not extended to the open fields."&lt;ref&gt;''Hester v. U.S.'', 265 U.S. 57, 57 (1924)&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion appears to be decided on the basis that "open fields are not a "constitutionally protected area" because they cannot be construed as "persons, houses, papers, [or] effects."

This method of reasoning gave way with the arrival of the landmark case ''[[Katz v. U.S.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Katz v. U.S.]]'', 389 U.S. 347 (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; which established a two-part test for what constitutes a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The relevant criteria are "first that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) [[expectation of privacy]] and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable'."&lt;ref&gt;''Katz v. U.S.'', 389 U.S. 347, 361 (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Under this new analysis of the Fourth Amendment, a search of an object or area where a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy is, in a legal sense, not a search at all. That search, therefore, does not trigger the protections of the Fourth Amendment.

In ''[[Oliver v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oliver v. U.S.]]'', 466 U.S. 170 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that a privacy expectation regarding an open field is unreasonable:

&lt;blockquote&gt;… open fields do not provide the setting for those intimate activities that the Amendment is intended to shelter from government interference or surveillance. There is no societal interest in protecting the privacy of those activities, such as the cultivation of crops, that occur in open fields.&lt;ref&gt;''Oliver v. U.S.'', 466 U.S. 170, 179 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Courts have continuously held that entry into an open field—whether [[trespass]] or not—is not a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. No matter what steps a person takes, he or she cannot create a reasonable privacy expectation in an open field, because it is an area incapable of supporting an expectation of privacy as a matter of constitutional law. In situations where the police allege that what was searched was an open field, this has the practical effect of shifting the argument from whether any given expectation of privacy is reasonable, to whether the given place is actually an open field or some other type of area like [[curtilage]]. This is because a person ''can'' have a reasonable expectation of privacy in areas classed as such.

== Distinguishing open fields from curtilage ==

While open fields are not protected by the Fourth Amendment, the [[curtilage]], or outdoor area immediately surrounding the home, may be protected. Courts have treated this area as an extension of the house and as such subject to all the privacy protections afforded a person's home (unlike a person's open fields) under the Fourth Amendment.
An area is curtilage if it "harbors the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life."&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Dunn]]'', 480 U.S. 294, 300 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Courts make this determination by examining "the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home, whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by."&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Dunn]]'', 480 U.S. 294, 301 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, many structures might extend the curtilage protection to the areas immediately surrounding them. The courts have gone so far as to treat a tent as a home for Fourth Amendment purposes in the past.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Gooch]]'', 6 F.3d 673 (9th Cir. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[LaDuke v. Nelson]]'', 762 F.2d 1318 (9th Cir. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[LaDuke v. Castillo]]'', 455 F.Supp. (E.D. Wash. 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; (Note:  these are 9th Circuit Court of Appeals cases and would not be binding authority in many, if not most, cases.) It is possible that the area immediately surrounding a tent (or any structure used as a home) might be considered curtilage.

Despite this rather broad interpretation of curtilage, the courts seem willing to find areas to be outside of the curtilage if they are in any way separate from the home (by a fence, great distance, other structures, even certain plants).&lt;ref&gt;''[[U.S. v. Hatch]]'', 931 F.2d 1478 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 883 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philo-Semitism''' (also spelled '''philosemitism''') or '''Judeophilia''' is an interest in, respect for and an appreciation of [[Jews|Jewish people]], [[Jewish history|their history]] and the influence of [[Judaism]], particularly on the part of a [[gentile]].

Within the Jewish community, philo-Semitism includes an interest in [[Jewish culture]] and a love of things considered Jewish.

==Overview==
The concept of philo-Semitism is not new, and it was arguably avowed by such thinkers as the 19th-century philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who described himself as an "anti-anti-Semite,"&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Christianity'', Volume 4 by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley&lt;/ref&gt; though he also criticized the Jewish people for their historical role in forming modern morality.&lt;ref&gt; "The Genealogy of Morals", Part I, Section 16, tr. Walter Kaufmann&lt;/ref&gt;  Enjoying a recent surge, it is characterized by an interest in [[Jewish culture]] and [[Jewish history|history]] and it is also manifested in increasing university enrollment by non-Jews in courses such as [[Judaism]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Jewish languages]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Philo-Semitism has been met by a mixed response from the Jewish community. Some warmly welcome it and argue that it must lead Jews to reconsider their identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com ''The Forward''], (Editorial, 10 November 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Others, {{Who|date=November 2009}} citing the special status that it implicitly gives to Jews even as its apparent opposite [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] does, reject it as running contrary to the [[Zionism|Zionist]] goal of making Jewry "a nation among nations."{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Philo-Semitism is an expression of the larger phenomenon of [[allophilia]], admiration for foreign cultures as embodied in the more widely known [[Anglophilia]] and [[Francophilia]]. The rise of philo-Semitism has also prompted some{{who|date=November 2017}} to reconsider Jewish history, and they argue that while anti-Semitism must be acknowledged, it is wrong to reduce the history of the Jewish people to one merely of suffering (as has been fostered by well-meaning gentile philo-Semites).{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Even though a non-Jew is not required to convert to Judaism or may even be advised against doing so, [[Halakha]] (Jewish [[religious law]]) does require all non-Jews to abide by certain commandments. These are the [[Seven Laws of Noah]], and gentiles who accept the Seven Laws in their traditional interpretation identify themselves as [[Noahide]]s.

From history, one notable example of philo-Semitism is [[Casimir III the Great#Relationship with Polish Jews|that of]] the Polish king [[Casimir III the Great]]. While the [[Jewish emancipation]] wouldn't begin in other countries until towards the end of the 1700s, in Poland Jews had been granted the freedom of worship, trade and travel in 1264 by [[Bolesław the Pious]]. In 1334 Jews persecuted across Europe were invited to Poland by Casimir the Great, who, in particular, vowed to protect them as "people of the king".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Poland, a Jewish Revival Thrives—Minus Jews|quote=Probably about 70 percent of the world's European Jews, or Ashkenazi, can trace their ancestry to Poland—thanks to a 14th-century king, Casimir III, the Great, who drew Jewish settlers from across Europe with his vow to protect them as "people of the king",|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 15th century more than half of all [[diaspora Jews]] were living in Poland, which kept its status as the main center of [[Ashkenazi Jewry]] until the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="Ashkenazim"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Ashkenazim.html|title=Ashkenazim|first=Shira|last=Schoenberg|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=24 May 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060427032733/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Ashkenazim.html| archivedate= 27 April 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few Jews live in [[East Asia]]n countries, but Jews are viewed in an especially positive light in some of them, partly owing to their shared wartime experiences during the [[Second World War]]. Examples include  [[South Korea]]&lt;ref name="Korea"&gt;Alper, Tim. "[http://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-features/48771/why-south-koreans-are-love-judaism Why South Koreans are in love with Judaism]". ''The Jewish Chronicle''. May 12, 2011. Retrieved February 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagler-Cohen, Liron. "[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4216893,00.html Chinese: 'Jews make money']". ''Ynetnews''. April 23, 2012. Retrieved February 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Jews are positively stereotyped as intelligent, business savvy and committed to family values and responsibility, while in the Western world, the first of the two aforementioned stereotypes more often have the negatively interpreted equivalents of guile and greed. In South Korean primary schools the [[Talmud]] is mandatory reading.&lt;ref name="Korea"/&gt; During World War II, Japan [[History of the Jews in Japan|made efforts]] to help Jews escape their demise at the hands of the Nazis, despite the fact that the country was then a member of the [[Axis powers|Axis alliance]]. The Japanese diplomat [[Chiune Sugihara]] facilitated the escape of more than 6,000 [[Jewish refugees]] to Japanese territory, risking his career and the lives of his family members; in 1985, he was honored by the [[State of Israel]] as [[Righteous Among the Nations]].  Annual surveys of a large number of countries conducted by the ADL have consistently shown very low levels of anti-Semitism in [[Southeast Asia]], persisting only at [[permyriad]] levels (hundredths of a per cent, i.e. 0.02 per cent in 2014) in [[Laos]].  These surveys, others, and polling and analysis about Israel have shown that [[India]] has low levels of anti-Semitism and relatively strong support for [[ADL 2014 Annual Report|Israel]], at the 55-65 per cent level, now surpassing the United States in the last respect.

The American singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] once called herself an "ambassador for Judaism"—during a meeting with Prime Minister of Israel [[Shimon Peres]], where they exchanged gifts, Madonna giving him a volume of the [[Zohar]] inscribed "To Shimon Peres, the man I admire and love, Madonna".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Madonna Says She's an 'Ambassador for Judaism' |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/09/16/madonna-says-ambassador-for-judaism/ |newspaper=The New York Sun |location= |publisher=Associated Press |date=September 17, 2007 |accessdate=February 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she herself does not practice Judaism, she has studied [[Kabbalah]], given her son a [[bar mitzva]] celebration and taken a Hebrew name: [[Esther]] (אסתר).

The controversial term "philosemitism" arose as a pejorative in [[Germany]] to describe positive prejudice towards Jews, in other words a philosemite is a "Jew-lover" or "Jew-friend".&lt;ref&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/book/review/philosemitism-history-sutcliffe-karp/ ''With Friends Like These''] Review of ''Philosemitism in History'' in the New Republic by Adam Karp&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12954">The '''Plastic Principle''' is an idea introduced into Western thought by the English philosopher [[Ralph Cudworth]] (1617–1689) to explain the function of nature and life in the face of both the mechanism and materialism of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. It is a dynamic functional power that contains all of natural law, and is both sustentative and generative, organizing matter according to Platonic Ideas, that is, archetypes that lie beyond the physical realm coming from the Mind of God or Deity, the ground of Being.

== Background ==

The role of nature was one faced by philosophers in the Age of Reason or Enlightenment. The prevailing view was either that of the Church of a personal deity intervening in his creation, producing miracles, or an ancient pantheism (atheism relative to theism) – deity pervading all things and existing in all things. However, the "ideas of an all-embracing providential care of the world and of one universal vital force capable of organizing the world from within."&lt;ref name=Giglioni&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giglioni|first=Guido|title=The cosmoplastic system of the universe: Ralph Cudworth on Stoic naturalism|journal=Revue d'histoire des sciences|year=2008/2|volume=Tome 61|pages=313–331|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-revue-d-histoire-des-sciences-2008-2-page-313.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  presented difficulties for philosophers of a spiritual as well as materialistic bent.

== Cambridge Platonists ==
The Cartesian idea of nature as mechanical, and Hobbes' materialistic views were countered by the English philosopher, Ralph Cudworth (1617–1689), who, in his ''True intellectual system of the universe'' (1678), addressing the tension between theism and atheism, took both the Stoic idea of Divine Reason poured into the world, and the Platonic idea of the world soul (''anima mundi'') to posit a power that was polaric – "either as a ruling but separate mind or as an informing vital principle – either nous hypercosmios or nous enkosmios.&lt;ref name=Giglioni /&gt;

Cudworth was a member of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], a group of English seventeenth-century thinkers associated with the University of Cambridge who were stimulated by Plato's teachings but also were aware or and influenced by Descartes, Hobbes, Bacon, Boyle and Spinoza. The other important philosopher of this group was Henry More (1614–1687). More held that spiritual substance or mind controlled inert matter. Out of his correspondence with Descartes, he developed the idea that everything, whether material or non, had extension, an example of the latter being space, which is infinite (Newton) and which then is correlative to the idea of God (set out in his Enchiridion metaphysicum 1667). In developing this idea, More also introduced a causal agent between God and substance, or Nature in his Hylarchic Principle, derived from Plato's ''anima mundi'' or world soul, and the Stoic's pneuma, which encapsulates the laws of nature, both for inert and vital nature, and involves a sympathetic resonance between soul (''psyche'') and ''soma''.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web|last=Stanford U. Encyc. of Philosophy|title=The Cambridge Platonists|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cambridge-platonists/|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cudworth's idea of 'the Plastick Life of Nature' ==

Like More, Cudworth put forward the idea of 'the Plastick Life of Nature', a formative principle that contains both substance and the laws of motion, as well as a nisus or direction that accounts for design and goal in the natural world. He was stimulated by the Cartesian idea of the mind as self-consciousness to see God as consciousness. He first analysed four forms of atheism from ancient times to present, and showed that all misunderstood the principle of life and knowledge, which involved unsentient activity and self-consciousness.

:It is in connection with the refutation of hylozoic atheism that he brings forward the celebrated hypothesis, which he held in common with More, of a plastic nature,—a substance intermediate between matter and spirit,—a power which prosecutes certain ends but not freely or intelligently,—an instrument by which laws are able to act without the immediate agency of God...&lt;ref name="1902 Encyc."&gt;{{cite web|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=1902|title=Ralph Cudworth|url=http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/C/CUD/ralph-cudworth.html|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All of the atheistic approaches posted nature as unconscious, which for Cudworth was ontologically unsupportable, as a principle that was supposed to be the ultimate source of life and meaning could only be itself self-conscious and knowledgeable, that is, rational, otherwise creation or nature degenerates into inert matter set in motion by random external forces (Coleridge's 'chance whirlings of unproductive particles'). Cudworth saw nature as a vegetative power endowed with plastic (forming) and spermatic (generative) forces, but one with Mind, or a self-conscious knowledge. This idea would later emerge in the Romantic period in German science as [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Blumenbach's ''Bildungstreib'']] (generative power) and the ''Lebenskraft'' (or ''Bildungskraft'').

:...the life of the universe splits into two principles&amp;nbsp;– the one transcendent and intellectual (« an animalish, sentient and intellectual nature, or a conscious soul and mind, that presided over the whole world »), the other immanent and devoid of perception (« a certain plastic nature, or spermatic principle which was properly the fate of all things »)&lt;ref name=Giglioni /&gt;

The essence of atheism for Cudworth was the view that matter was self-active and self-sufficient, whereas for Cudworth the plastic power was unsentient and under the direct control of the universal Mind or ''Logos''. For him atheism, whether mechanical or material could not solve the "phenomenon of nature." Henry More argued that atheism made each substance independent and self-acting such that it 'deified' matter. Cudworth argued that materialism/mechanism reduced "substance to a corporeal entity, its activity to causal determinism, and each single thing to fleeting appearances in a system dominated by material necessity."&lt;ref name=Giglioni /&gt;

Cudworth had the idea of a general plastic nature of the world, containing natural laws to keep all of nature, inert and vital in orderly motion, and particular plastic natures in particular entities, which serve as 'Inward Principles' of growth and motion, but ascribes it to the Platonic tradition:
:The Platonists seem to affirm both these together, namely that there is a Plastick Nature lodged in all particular Souls of Animals, Brutes, and Men, and also that there is a Plastick or Spermatick Principle of the whole Universe distinct from the Higher Mundane Soul, though subordinate to it.(Cudworth, TIS, p. 165)&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Justin E. H.|title=The Leibnizian Organism Between Cudworth's Plastic Natures and Locke's Thinking Matter|url=http://www.bib.umontreal.ca/colloqueNE/textes_des_communications/Smith.pdf|publisher=Concordia University, Montreal|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further, Cudsworth's plastic principle was also a functional polarity. As he wrote:
:The Seminary Reason or Plastick Nature of the Universe opposing the Parts to one another and making them severally Indigent, produces by that means War and Contention. And therefore though it be One, yet notwithstanding it consists of Different and Contrary things. For there being Hostility in its Parts, it is nevertheless Friendly and Agreeable in the Whole; after the same manner as in a Dramatick Poem, Clashings and Contentions are reconciled into one Harmony. And therefore the Seminary or Plastick Nature of the World, may fitly be resembled to the Harmony of Disagreeing things.&lt;ref name=Raiger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raiger|first=Michael|title=The Intellectual Breeze, the Corporeality of Thought, and the Eolian Harp|journal=Coleridge Bulletin|date=Winter 2002|series=New Series|issue=20|pages=76–84|url=http://www.friendsofcoleridge.com/MembersOnly/CB20Raiger.htm|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As another historian notes in conclusion, "Cudworth’s theory of plastic natures is offered as an alternative to the interpretation of all of nature as either governed by blind chance, or, on his understanding of the Malebranchean view, as micro-managed by God."&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

== Plastic Principle and mind ==
Cudworth's plastic principle also involves a theory of mind that is active, that is, God or the Supreme Mind is "the spermatic reason" which gives rise to individual mind and reason. Human mind can also create, and has access to spiritual or super-sensible 'Ideas' in the Platonic sense.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; Cudworth challenged Hobbesian determinism in arguing that will is not distinct from reason, but a power to act that is internal, and therefore, the voluntary will function involves self-determination, not external compulsion, though we have the power to act either in accordance with God's will or not. Cudworth's 'hegemonikon' (taken from Stoicism) is a function within the soul that combines the higher functions of the soul (voluntary will and reason) on the one hand with the lower animal functions (instinct), and also constitutes the whole person, thus bridging the Cartesian dualism of body and soul or ''psyche'' and ''soma''. This idea provided the basis for a concept of self-awareness and identity of an individual that is self-directed and autonomous, an idea that anticipates John Locke.

== Influence on Locke ==
Locke examined how man came to knowledge via stimulus (rather than seeing ideas as inherent), which approach led to his idea of the 'thinking' mind, which is both receptive and pro-active. The first involves receiving sensations ('simple ideas') and the second by reflection – "observation of its own inner operations" (inner sense which leads to complex ideas), with the second activity acting upon the first. Thought is set in motion by outer stimuli which 'simple ideas' are taken up by the mind's self-activity, an "active power" such that the outer world can only be real-ized as action (natural cause) by the activity of consciousness. Locke also took the issue of life as lying not in substance but in the capacity of the self for consciousness, to be able to organize (associate) disparate events, that is to participate life by means of the [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]s, which have the capacity to produce every kind of experience in consciousness. These ideas of Locke were taken over by Fichte and influenced German Romantic science and medicine. (See [[Romantic medicine]] and [[Brunonian system of medicine]]).
[[Thomas Reid]] and his "Common Sense" philosophy, was also influenced by Cudworth, taking his influence into the Scottish Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;

Berkeley later developed the idea of a plastic life principle with his idea of an 'aether' or 'aetherial medium' that causes 'vibrations' that animate all living beings. For Berkeley, it is the very nature of this medium that generates the 'attractions' of entities to each other.

:The refraction of light is also thought to proceed from the different density and elastic force of this æthereal medium in different places. The vibrations of this medium, alternately concurring with or obstructing the motions of the rays of light, are supposed to produce the fits of easy reflection and transmission. Light by the vibrations of this medium is thought to communicate heat to bodies. Animal motion and sensation are also accounted for by the vibrating motions of this æthereal medium, propagated through the solid capillaments of the nerves. In a word, all the phenomena and properties of bodies that were before attributed to attraction, upon later thoughts seem ascribed to this æther, together with the various attractions themselves. (Berkeley V 107–8)&lt;ref name="Raiger"/&gt;

Berkeley meant this 'aether' to supplant Newton's gravity as the cause of motion (neither seeing the polarity involved between two forces, as Cudworth had in his plastic principle). However, in Berkeley's conception, aether is both the movement of spirit and the motion of nature.

Both Cudworth's views and those of Berkeley were taken up by Coleridge in his metaphor of the eolian harp in his 'Effusion XXXV' as one commentator noted: "what we see in the first manuscript is the articulation of Cudworth’s principle of plastic nature, which is then transformed in the published version into a Berkeleyan expression of the causal agency of motion performed by God’s immanent activity."&lt;ref name="Raiger"/&gt;

Cudworth's idea of the plastic principle and that of mind will also be taken up in a new way in the idea of [[emergent evolution]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11807">In [[mathematics]], a '''quiver''' is a [[directed graph]] where loops and multiple arrows between two [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] are allowed, i.e. a [[multidigraph]]. They are commonly used in [[representation theory]]: a representation&amp;nbsp;''V'' of a quiver assigns a [[vector space]]&amp;nbsp;''V''(''x'') to each vertex&amp;nbsp;''x'' of the quiver and a [[linear map]]&amp;nbsp;''V''(''a'') to each arrow&amp;nbsp;''a''.

In [[category theory]], a quiver can be understood to be the underlying structure of a [[category (mathematics)|category]], but without composition or a designation of identity morphisms.  That is, there is a [[forgetful functor]] from '''Cat''' to '''Quiv'''.  Its [[left adjoint]] is a [[free functor]] which, from a quiver, makes the corresponding [[free category]].

==Definition==

A quiver Γ consists of:
* The set ''V'' of vertices of Γ
* The set ''E'' of edges of Γ
* Two functions: ''s'': ''E'' → ''V'' giving the ''start'' or ''source'' of the edge, and another function, ''t'': ''E'' → ''V'' giving the ''target'' of the edge.

This definition is identical to that of a [[multidigraph]].

A [[morphism]] of quivers is defined as follows.  If &lt;math&gt;\Gamma=(V,E,s,t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma'=(V',E',s',t')&lt;/math&gt; are two quivers, then a morphism &lt;math&gt;m=(m_v, m_e)&lt;/math&gt; of quivers consist of two functions &lt;math&gt;m_v: V\to V'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_e: E\to E'&lt;/math&gt; such that following [[commuting diagram|diagrams commute]]:  
:&lt;math&gt;m_v \circ s = s' \circ m_e&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;m_v \circ t = t' \circ m_e&lt;/math&gt;

==Category-theoretic definition==
The above definition is based in [[set theory]]; the category-theoretic definition generalizes this into a [[functor]] from the ''free quiver''  to the [[category of sets]].

The '''free quiver''' (also called the '''walking quiver''', '''Kronecker quiver''', '''2-Kronecker quiver''' or '''Kronecker category''') ''Q'' is a category with two objects, and four morphisms: The objects are ''V'' and ''E''.  The four morphisms are ''s'': ''E'' → ''V'', ''t'': ''E'' → ''V'', and the [[identity morphism]]s id&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''V'' → ''V'' and id&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''E'' → ''E''.  That is, the free quiver is

:&lt;math&gt;E 
\;\begin{matrix}  s \\[-6pt] \rightrightarrows \\[-4pt] t \end{matrix}\; V&lt;/math&gt;

A quiver is then a [[functor]] Γ: ''Q'' → '''Set'''.

More generally, a quiver in a category ''C'' is a functor Γ: ''Q'' → ''C''.  The category '''Quiv'''(''C'') of quivers in ''C'' is the [[functor category]] where:

* objects are functors Γ: ''Q'' → ''C'',
* morphisms are [[natural transformation]]s between functors.

Note that '''Quiv''' is the [[category of presheaves]] on the [[opposite category]] ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Path algebra==
If Γ is a quiver, then a '''path''' in Γ is a sequence of arrows ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; such that the head of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;tail of&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, using the convention of concatenating paths from right to left.

If ''K'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] then the '''quiver algebra''' or  '''path algebra''' ''K''Γ is defined as a vector space having all the paths (of length&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0) in the quiver as basis (including, for each vertex ''i'' of the quiver Γ, a ''trivial path'' &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; of length 0; these paths are ''not'' assumed to be equal for different ''i''), and multiplication given by concatenation of paths. If two paths cannot be concatenated because the end vertex of the first is not equal to the starting vertex of the second, their product is defined to be zero. This defines an [[associative algebra]] over ''K''. This algebra has a unit element if and only if the quiver has only finitely many vertices. In this case, the [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over ''K''Γ are naturally identified with the representations of Γ. If the quiver has infinitely many vertices, then ''K''Γ has an [[approximate identity]] given by &lt;math&gt;e_E:=\sum_{v\in E} 1_v&lt;/math&gt; where ''E'' ranges over finite subsets of the vertex set of Γ.

If the quiver has finitely many vertices and arrows, and the end vertex and starting vertex of any path are always distinct (i.e. ''Q'' has no oriented cycles), then ''K''Γ is a finite-[[dimension of a vector space|dimensional]] [[hereditary algebra]] over ''K''. Conversely, if ''K'' is algebraically closed, then any finite-dimensional, hereditary, associative algebra over ''K'' is [[Morita equivalence|Morita equivalent]] to the path algebra of its [[Ext quiver]] (i.e., they have equivalent module categories).

== Representations of quivers ==

A representation of a quiver ''Q'' is an association of an ''R''-module to each vertex of ''Q'', and a morphism between each module for each arrow.

A representation ''V'' of a quiver ''Q'' is said to be ''trivial'' if ''V''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all vertices ''x'' in&amp;nbsp;''Q''.

A ''morphism'', ''f'':&amp;nbsp;''V''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''V′'', between representations of the quiver ''Q'', is a collection of linear maps &lt;math&gt;f(x):V(x)\rightarrow V'(x)&lt;/math&gt; such that for every arrow ''a'' in ''Q'' from ''x'' to ''y'' &lt;math&gt;V'(a) f(x) = f(y) V(a) &lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the squares that ''f'' forms with the arrows of ''V'' and ''V′'' all commute.  A morphism, ''f'', is an ''isomorphism'', if ''f''(''x'') is invertible for all vertices ''x'' in the quiver.  With these definitions the representations of a quiver form a [[Category (mathematics)|category]].

If ''V'' and ''W'' are representations of a quiver ''Q'', then the direct sum of these representations, &lt;math&gt;V\oplus W&lt;/math&gt;, is defined by &lt;math&gt;(V\oplus W)(x)=V(x)\oplus W(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all vertices ''x'' in ''Q'' and &lt;math&gt;(V\oplus W)(a)&lt;/math&gt; is the direct sum of the linear mappings ''V''(''a'') and&amp;nbsp;''W''(''a'').

A representation is said to be ''decomposable'' if it is isomorphic to the direct sum of non-zero representations.

A [[Category theory|categorical]] definition of a quiver representation can also be given.  The quiver itself can be considered a category, where the vertices are objects and paths are morphisms.  Then a representation of ''Q'' is just a covariant [[functor]] from this category to the category of finite dimensional [[vector space]]s.  Morphisms of representations of ''Q'' are precisely [[natural transformations]] between the corresponding functors.

For a finite quiver Γ (a quiver with finitely many vertices and edges), let ''K''Γ be its path algebra.  Let ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the trivial path at vertex&amp;nbsp;''i''.  Then we can associate to the vertex&amp;nbsp;''i'' the [[projective module|projective]] ''K''Γ-module ''K''Γ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' consisting of linear combinations of paths which have starting vertex&amp;nbsp;''i''.  This corresponds to the representation of Γ obtained by putting a copy of ''K'' at each vertex which lies on a path starting at ''i'' and 0 on each other vertex.  To each edge joining two copies of ''K'' we associate the identity map.

== Quiver with relations ==
To enforce commutativity of some squares inside a quiver a generalization is the notion of quivers with relations (also named bound quivers).
A relation on a quiver &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; linear combination of paths from &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.
A quiver with relation is a pair &lt;math&gt;(Q, I)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; a quiver and &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq K\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; an
ideal of the path algebra. The quotient &lt;math&gt;K\Gamma/I&lt;/math&gt; is the path algebra of &lt;math&gt;(Q, I)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Quiver Variety===

Given the dimensions of the vector spaces assigned to every vertex, one can form a variety which characterizes all representations of that quiver with those specified dimensions, and consider stability conditions. These give quiver varieties, as constructed by {{harvtxt|King|1994}}.

== Gabriel's theorem ==

{{main|Gabriel's theorem}}
A quiver is of '''finite type''' if it has only finitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable representations. {{harvtxt|Gabriel|1972}} classified all quivers of finite type, and also their indecomposable representations. More precisely, Gabriel's theorem states that:

# A (connected) quiver is of finite type if and only if its underlying graph (when the directions of the arrows are ignored) is one of the [[ADE classification|ADE]] [[Dynkin diagram]]s: &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_6&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_7&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_8&lt;/math&gt;.
# The indecomposable representations are in a one-to-one correspondence with the positive roots of the [[root system]] of the Dynkin diagram.

{{harvtxt|Dlab|Ringel|1973}} found a generalization of Gabriel's theorem in which all Dynkin diagrams of finite dimensional semisimple Lie algebras occur.

A '''reasonable accommodation''' is an adjustment made in a system to accommodate or make fair the same system for an individual based on a proven need. That need can vary.   Accommodations can be religious, physical, mental or emotional, academic, or employment related and are often mandated by law. Each country has its own system of reasonable accommodations. The [[United Nations]] use this term in the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], saying refusal to make accommodation results in [[discrimination]]. It defines a "reasonable accommodation" as:

{{quote|... necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or undue burden, where needed in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights and fundamental freedoms;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?navid=13&amp;pid=150 |title=Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities |date= |author= |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Canada==

In [[Canada]] [[equality rights]], as set out in provincial and [[Canadian Human Rights Act|federal anti-discrimination laws]] and in [[section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], require that accommodation be made to various minorities. (The origin of the term ''reasonable accommodation'' in Canadian law is found in its labour law jurisprudence, specifically ''[[Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v Simpsons-Sears Ltd]]'', [1985] 2 SCR 536, and is argued to be the obligation of employers to change some general rules for certain employees, under the condition that this does not cause "[[undue hardship]]".)

===Quebec===
In Quebec, under the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] and the provincial charter of human rights, politicians engaged in "values" clarifications on accommodation from at least 2007. In that time, various ideologies attempted to impose onto Quebecers definitions of values, without consensus or even legislative success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/dan-delmar-why-quebec-values-remain-undefined-after-a-decade-of-debate|title=Dan Delmar: Why Quebec Values Remain Undefined After a Decade of Debate|date=22 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question on what was and will be the national identity has been contested, such as the court decision on the wearing of the Sikh [[kirpan]] in ''[[Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys]].''

The municipal council of the town of [[Hérouxville, Quebec|Hérouxville]] passed a "[[Hérouxville Standards|code of conduct]]" for residents. It provided details of expectations of behaviour, and defined practices of other countries that were not acceptable in the town, such as stoning women or [[death by burning|burning them alive]], and [[female genital mutilation]]. The code of conduct also explained common practices in Canadian culture. It said that carrying a weapon to school (a reference to the [[Sikh]] ceremonial [[kirpan]]), covering one's face (some particular forms of the Muslim [[veil]]), and making accommodation for prayer in public schools would not be permitted. It attests that "Our people eat to nourish the body, not the soul," in reference to [[Kashrut|Jewish]] and [[Halal|Muslim dietary laws]], and that health-care professionals "do not have to ask permission to perform blood transfusions."

This code of conduct was developed as the town and province absorbed more immigrants from other cultures. Other cultural questions arose. In 2007 a [[YMCA]] set up [[clouded windows]] to shield ultra-Orthodox Jews who had complained that youngsters could see girls and women in gym attire. There have been questions about whether voters are allowed to fill out and submit ballots while clothed in a [[niqab]] or [[burqa|burka]], which can hide identity. A Muslim spokesman said that women are always required to show identity for public purposes, so it was a question raised unnecessarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=CTV.ca|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070911/{{Not a typo|accom|odation}}_quebec_070911/20070911?hub=Canada|title=Immigrants Source of Enrichment to Quebec: Group|date=11 September 2007|accessdate=4 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most residents in Quebec have identified as Catholic on surveys, the province has become increasingly secular, with declining rates of church attendance. The provincial government has worked to reach an accommodation with the Roman Catholic Church on guidelines for conversion or disposal of underused churches.  The church has allowed local parishes to work with municipalities to develop the buildings as community centres, for example, rather than for private condominium construction.

====Judaism====
In 2007, Benjamin Rubin, a forward with the [[Gatineau Olympiques]] [[ice hockey]] team, refused to play several key matches because they fell on a [[Jewish holiday]].  Some claimed the [[Jews]] would end up forcing the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] to reschedule all their matches on Fridays and Saturdays. Rubin and the Olympiques came to an agreement, and "he will only miss a handful of games."

In 2007 [[Elections Canada]] ruled that Muslim women wearing the [[niqab]] (veil) or [[Burqa|burka]] would be allowed to vote in all upcoming national elections, by-elections and referendums without showing their faces to an Elections Canada official.&lt;ref name="veil"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=a3170edf-a111-443d-b2fe-2b2361274eb2&amp;k=52399|title=Canadians with Faces Veiled Can Vote|date=8 September 2007|work=[[National Post]]|last=Offman|first=Craig|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910124149/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=a3170edf-a111-443d-b2fe-2b2361274eb2&amp;k=52399|archivedate=10 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same policy applies to all Canadians under federal Bill C-31, in that photo identification is not strictly required if two other pieces of acceptable official identification are provided, or another voter vouches for them. The proclamation created social animosity towards Muslims in Quebec.&lt;ref name="veil"/&gt; Premier [[Jean Charest]] of Quebec described this as a bad decision. He noted that Quebec's [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] had voted to forbid Muslim women from voting if they would not reveal their faces as a confirmation of identity.&lt;ref name="veil"/&gt;

The national [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government challenged Elections Canada to review this decision. The federal [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] and the [[Bloc Québécois]] also requested such a reversal, to demand that all voters be required to show their faces in order to vote, even those whose faces are normally covered for religious reasons. They joined other federal and provincial politicians from Quebec who attacked the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/politics/story.html?id=4a1a8fe7-60f0-4dff-9f05-9686c31cbb2e |title=No Veils at the Polls, Feds Urge |date=8 September 2007 |location=Montreal |work=The Gazette |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102181239/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/politics/story.html?id=4a1a8fe7-60f0-4dff-9f05-9686c31cbb2e |archivedate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Elgazzar, an advocate for the [[Canadian Council on American–Islamic Relations]] in Montreal, declared that it is improbable that very many Muslim women will have hidden faces when voting. Elgazzar insisted that women using niqabs usually take them off to distinguish themselves and do not sport them for photo identification. This fact was echoed by Salam Elmenyawi of the Muslim Council of Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=e3bb831c-31fd-4988-a486-190b5d472ba1 |title=Hey, Here's an Idea: Let's Ask Muslims What They Think |date=8 September 2007 |location=Montreal |work=The Gazette |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102174601/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=e3bb831c-31fd-4988-a486-190b5d472ba1 |archivedate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Media exposure====

There was extensive coverage of related issues in Quebec's news media in 2006 and 2007. Some analysts attributed this more to competition among media than a measure of citizen concern. The [[premier of Quebec]] declared several non-negotiable values, such as "the equality of women and men; the primacy of French; the separation between the state and religion".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The conservative political party [[Action démocratique du Québec]] (ADQ) appeared to gain support from these debates. It formed the official opposition in the provincial legislature for one term from 2007 to 2008, until the increasing prominence of the global economic crisis relegated reasonable accommodation to an issue of less importance.&lt;ref name=debatebegin&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=ec4ec029-c021-4571-a25e-fa73850b3857&amp;k=99148|publisher=The Gazette (Montreal)|title=Let the Debate Begin|last=Carroll|first=Ann|date=15 August 2007|accessdate=14 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026051327/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=ec4ec029-c021-4571-a25e-fa73850b3857&amp;k=99148|archivedate=26 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Employment integration====

A 2006 examination from [[Statistics Canada]] demonstrated that Quebec had the highest newcomer unemployment rate in Canada.&lt;ref name="Bryan2007"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bryan|first1=Jay|title=Wanted: Reasonable Accommodation in the Job Market|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal-gazette/20070911/281590941183811|accessdate=4 May 2017|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=11 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The newest immigrants endured an unemployment ratio of 17.8 per cent in 2006, or almost three times the 6.3 per cent ratio of native-born help.  In contrast, joblessness among current newcomers in Ontario was 11 per cent contrasted with 4.4 per cent among the Canadian born. In British Columbia, the numbers were 9.5 per cent and 3.7 per cent, respectively.&lt;ref name="Bryan2007"/&gt;

The study's coauthor, Danielle Zietsma, was reported to have cautioned that she and her colleagues would need some time to conduct the analyses necessary to explain the basis of these findings. The ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' columnist Jay Bryan suggested that Quebec was exceptional in the degree to which it imposed hurdles on new immigrants seeking employment in the province, including "the devaluation of allegedly inadequate foreign credentials, language tests that have little to do with professional performance, and 'Canadian experience' requirements that serve as an all-purpose excuse to lock out job applicants who don't already have a job."&lt;ref name="Bryan2007"/&gt; However, the column reported that the study had found similar numbers of surveyed immigrants had indicated that the demand for Canadian experience (26 per cent) or foreign credentialing and work experience recognition problems (21 per cent) as principal barriers to employment.&lt;ref name="Bryan2007"/&gt;

====Political reaction====

Former leader of the [[Parti Québécois]] [[André Boisclair]] noted, "We're not talking about reasonable accommodation [if] it has nothing to do with public services", Boisclair said. At the same time, Boisclair blamed Premier [[Jean Charest]] for pandering to Quebecers who balk at adjustments made for immigrants in civil society. Charest declined to defend them when girls wearing [[hijab]] were prohibited from soccer and tae kwon do, and when prejudiced remarks were offered about Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/columnists/article/256056 |title=One Law for One and All, Consistently Applied |date=13 September 2007 |author=Haroon Siddiqui |work=The Star |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mario Dumont]], leader of the [[Action démocratique du Québec]] (ADQ) said in an interview in ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' that Quebec needs more immigration for economic and demographic reasons, but that he believes that Quebec had met its limits of immigrant acculturation, and that any further increase in rates of immigration would create [[ghettos]]. (At present, the province accepts a smaller percentage of newcomers than elsewhere in Canada.)
He criticized Charest for a plan to raise such levels when the Liberal government has cut funds for integration of newcomers into French culture. "We're a linguistic minority...and immigrants need francization", Dumont said. "It's quite a challenge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/quebec-to-reconsider-integration-of-immigrants-1.252497 |title=Quebec to Reconsider Integration of Immigrants |date=14 August 2007 |author= |publisher=Canadian Press |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then Parti Québécois leader [[Pauline Marois]] said that Quebec should assume all control over its immigration, not the 60 per cent that it has now under a bilateral agreement with the government of Canada. She also said the province should make the message clear to immigrants that Quebec is a francophone "state", not officially bilingual as are the federal government and Quebec's neighbouring province [[New Brunswick]].

Marois said that Quebec is in need of more immigrants, to offset a low birth rate for future labour needs. She further believes that Quebec is a francophone state in which the rights of the [[English-speaking Quebecker|anglophone minority]] are respected, and where all the inhabitants live in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=2c1f14fb-f55f-45a9-abee-4167c3b702c6&amp;k=58090 |title=Let Quebec Control Its Immigration, Marois Says |date=15 August 2007 |author= |work=National Post |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charest criticized his political adversaries in the provincial legislature, and blamed them for encouraging "intolerance" in the continuing controversy. He published an open letter in regional dailies, saying he is worried the province's image of openness will diminish outside Quebec.

Dumont's statements about immigration, he said, led to the passing of a code of conduct by the town of [[Hérouxville]] that notified Muslims that face veils or stoning women would not be accepted there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20071030/charest_lashesout_071030/20071030?hub=Canada |title=Charest Lashes Out on Reasonable Accommodation |date=30 October 2007 |author= |publisher=The Canadian Press |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bouchard–Taylor Commission====
Premier [[Jean Charest]], citing several instances of "unreasonable" accommodation, [[advice (constitutional)|advised]] the [[Lieutenant Governor of Quebec]] to appoint a two-man commission in February 2007, to investigate the issue of reasonable accommodation, and report back by 31 March 2008. The formal title for the commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/article/266436 |title=Canadian Reality Is Multicultural |date=15 October 2007 |author= |work=The Star |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the ''Consultation Commission on Accommodation Practices Related to Cultural Differences'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=dd9de1f7-279d-4ca1-9c8d-e3f176f8501d |title=Quebecers Could Use a Primer on the History of Immigration |date=22 August 2007 |author= |location=Montreal |work=The Gazette |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026055500/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=dd9de1f7-279d-4ca1-9c8d-e3f176f8501d |archivedate=26 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is sometimes called the ''Bouchard–Taylor Commission''.  Its commissioners are professors [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], a well-known federalist and philosopher, and [[Gérard Bouchard]], a historian and sociologist. Bouchard said in an interview that ''sovereignty'' was the solution to calm Franco-Quebecers' cultural insecurity. Co-chair Taylor stated, however, that Quebecers need to demonstrate the "openness and generosity of spirit" that majorities should have towards minorities.&lt;ref name=debatebegin /&gt;

The commission conducted hearings in various Quebec regions. The committee listened to individuals, organizations, and so-called experts on Quebec identity, religion, and integration of cultural communities ([[minority groups]]). Before formal proceedings began, Bouchard and Taylor said they heard in focus groups across the province that there was insecurity among Quebec's traditional ethnic French population. They believed that hearings would help with educating the public; for instance, they thought the perception of Muslim influence was higher among some groups than is justified by data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=4e87dde2-987c-4872-9cb9-d0f430ec8ccd |title=Bouchard and Taylor Will Have to Speak, Too |date=22 August 2007 |location=Montreal |work=The Gazette |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026062803/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=4e87dde2-987c-4872-9cb9-d0f430ec8ccd |archivedate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor underlined that Quebecers need to show an "openness and generosity of spirit" for 'cultural communities. As well, the report recommended that accommodation be made in public schools to allow students who want to wear religious attire in class, such as the hijab, kippah or turban, to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-dumb-to-say-niqab-is-anti-women-charles-taylor-says-1.3013427|title=Former Quebec Commission Chair Calls Harper's Niqab Line 'Dumb'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bouchard–Taylor report recommended that judges, Crown prosecutors, prison guards and police officers refrain from wearing any religious attire or symbols. "We believe that a majority of Quebecers accept that a uniform prohibition applying to all government employees regardless of the nature of their position is excessive, but want those employees who occupy positions that embody at the highest level the necessary neutrality of the state&amp;nbsp;... to impose on themselves a form of circumspection concerning the expression of their religious convictions", Bouchard and Taylor wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/chris-selley-charles-taylor-niqab-defender|title=Chris Selley: Charles Taylor ... Niqab Defender?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission also recommended that the crucifix in the National Assembly, placed above the Speaker's chair by Premier [[Maurice Duplessis]], be removed to another part of the building. This is a recommendation that successive governments have rejected.&lt;ref&gt;https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/dangerous-appalling-divisive-destructive-charles-taylor-on-the-caqs-religious-symbols-plan&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, In the aftermath of the [[Charter of Quebecois Values]] debate, Taylor stated that he no longer supports that opinion, and said it was misinterpreted by many politicians. The Bouchard–Taylor report deliberately did not include teachers, civil servants and health-care professionals from those that should be forbidden to wear religious symbols.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-legault-gets-ahead-of-himself-on-the-notwithstanding-clause/&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

In the United States, federal law requires that reasonable accommodations be made for employment, education, housing, courts, and public venues.

===Employment===
The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans With Disabilities Act]], known as ADA, was signed into law on 26 July 1990. It carried forward material from Section 504 of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]]. 'A reasonable accommodation' is defined by the US Department of Justice as "any modification or adjustment to a job or the work environment that will enable a qualified applicant or employee with a disability to participate in the application process or to perform essential job functions. Reasonable accommodation also includes adjustments to assure that a qualified individual with a disability has [[employment equity|rights and privileges in employment]] equal to those of employees without disabilities."{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In September 2012, [[Home Depot]] company agreed to pay $100,000 and furnish other relief to settle a [[disability]] discrimination lawsuit filed by the US [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], for the alleged failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for a cashier with cancer at its [[Towson, Maryland]], store, and then for purportedly firing her because of her condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Depot to Pay $100,000 to Settle EEOC Disability Discrimination Suit
|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/home-depot-to-pay-100000-to-settle-eeoc-disability-discrimination-suit |publisher=US [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] |work=The National Law Review|date=10 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State and local government services, programs, and activities===
Title II of the ADA provides that "no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subject to discrimination by any such entity".&lt;ref&gt;Civil Rights. (2012). US Department of Health &amp; Human Services. Retrieved 28 January 2014 from https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; State and local governments must provide reasonable accommodations to ensure such access, unless a fundamental alteration would result.

===Public accommodations===
Title III of the ADA requires private businesses open to the public and commercial facilities to provide reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities to ensure that they have equal access to goods and services.

===Housing===
Under Title VIII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, codified in the United States Code at 42 USC §§ 3601–3619, and commonly known as the Fair Housing Act, virtually all housing providers must make reasonable accommodations in their rules, policies, practices, or services under certain circumstances.  A reasonable accommodation must be granted when such an accommodation is necessary to afford a prospective or existing tenant with a disability an [[right to housing|opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling]] (including but not limited to apartments, single family homes, and other types of private and public housing) to the same extent as a person who does not have that disability.  The Fair Housing Act covers "dwellings", and in many situations that term encompasses such non-traditional housing as homeless shelters and college dormitories. It bears noting that in regard to larger dwellings such as apartment buildings, the right to a reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing Act requires that housing providers grant a requested reasonable accommodation that is necessary to enable a disabled tenant to enjoy an indoor or outdoor common area to the same extent as a non-disabled tenant enjoys such areas.

In regard to reasonable accommodations, there is no requirement that a housing provider initiate the reasonable accommodation process; the Fair Housing Act contemplates that a tenant will approach his or her landlord with a request for a change in the landlord's policies that will reasonably accommodate the tenant's disability.  For example, a prospective or actual tenant whose disability requires him to use crutches may request a reasonable accommodation in the form of an assigned parking space close to the entrance of his or her apartment building.  If the disability is of a kind covered by the Fair Housing Act, and there is a genuine relationship between the requested accommodation and the disability, and granting the reasonable accommodation would not fundamentally alter the nature of the landlord's operations or impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the landlord, then the landlord must grant the requested reasonable accommodation or else find himself in violation of the Fair Housing Act and liable for substantial civil money penalties as well as payment to the disabled person for the injury suffered by him or her.

The Fair Housing Act is enforced by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), whose regulations governing reasonable accommodations are found at 24 CFR § 100.204.  Sometimes it is easy to tell when (for example) a tenant has a disability and the tenant's reasonable accommodation request must be granted; other times it is not quite so apparent that a tenant suffers from a recognized disability.  But a housing provider has an obligation to engage in an interactive process in order to honestly try to figure out whether the requested accommodation is reasonable and must be granted.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development and the US Department of Justice have issued a joint statement to provide guidance on the concept of reasonable accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hud.gov/offices/fheo/library/huddojstatement.pdf | title=Joint Statement of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Justice&amp;nbsp;– Reasonable Accommodations Under the Fair Housing Act | date=17 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (including the amendments made by the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008), overlaps with the Fair Housing Act in its coverage of [[public housing]].  As noted on HUD's website: "Public housing was established to provide decent and safe rental housing for eligible low-income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/ph|title=Public Housing |publisher=HUD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a million US households live in public housing.

==United Kingdom==

The laws of England, Wales, and Scotland require employers to make reasonable accommodations for disabled employees, initially under the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]], and now under the [[Equality Act 2010]]. Failure to do so can give rise to a complaint by an employee to an [[employment tribunal]].

The '''''Republic''''' ({{lang-el|Πολιτεία}}) was a work written by [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy at the beginning of the 3rd century BC. Although it has not survived, it was his most famous work, and various quotes and paraphrases were preserved by later writers. The purpose of the work was to outline the ideal society based on Stoic principles, where virtuous men and women would live a life of simple asceticism in an equal society.

==Content==
Written, it would seem, in conscious opposition to [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On Stoic self-contradictions'', 1034F&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno's ''Republic'' (''politeia'') outlined the principles of an ideal [[Sovereign state|state]] written from the point of view of early Stoic philosophy. The work has not survived; but it was widely known in antiquity and more is known about it than any of his other works. [[Plutarch]] provides a summary of its intent:
{{quote|It is true indeed that the so much admired ''Republic'' of Zeno, first author of the Stoic sect, aims singly at this, that neither in cities nor in towns we should live under laws distinct one from  another, but that we should look upon all people in general to be our fellow-countryfolk  and citizens, observing one manner of living and one kind of order, like a flock  feeding together with equal right in one common pasture. This Zeno wrote, fancying to himself, as in a dream, a certain scheme of civil order, and the image of a philosophical commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On the Fortune of Alexander'', 329A–B&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is not obvious from Plutarch's remarks whether he had read the work himself. One person who had read it was an otherwise unknown figure known as "Cassius the Skeptic", whose polemic written against Zeno's ''Republic'' is paraphrased by [[Diogenes Laërtius]]:
{{quote|Some there are, and among them Cassius the Sceptic and his disciples, who accuse Zeno at length. Their first count is that in the beginning of his ''Republic'' he pronounced the ordinary education useless: the next is that he applies to all men who are not virtuous the opprobrious epithets of foemen, enemies, slaves, and aliens to one another, parents to children, brothers to brothers, friends to friends. Again, in the ''Republic'', making an invidious contrast, he declares the good alone to be true citizens or friends or kindred or free men; and accordingly in the view of the Stoics parents and children are enemies, not being wise. Again, it is objected, in the ''Republic'' he lays down community of wives, and at line 200 prohibits the building of temples, law-courts and [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasia]] in cities; while as regards a currency he writes that we should not think it need be introduced either for purposes of exchange or for travelling abroad. Further, he bids men and women wear the same dress and keep no part of the body entirely covered. {{sfn|Laërtius|1925b|loc=§ 32–33}} }}

Further on, Laërtius makes some further remarks which also seem to be from the same work by Cassius:
{{quote|Further, they say that the wise man will feel affection for the youths who by their countenance show a natural endowment for virtue. So Zeno in his ''Republic''. ... It is also their doctrine that amongst the wise there should be a community of wives with free choice of partners, as Zeno says in his ''Republic'' and Chrysippus in his treatise ''On the Republic'', ... under such circumstances we shall feel paternal affection for all the children alike, and there will be an end of the jealousies arising from adultery. {{sfn|Laërtius|1925b|loc=§ 129–131}} }}

These paraphrases by Cassius are not a neutral summary of the ''Republic'', his purpose seems to be to describe all the doctrines in the work which he found shocking. These include Zeno's denouncement of general education; his exhortation that only the virtuous can be regarded as true citizens; his view that men and women should wear the same clothes; and the idea that "there should be a community of wives", which in practice seems to have meant "recognizing no other form of marriage than the union of the man who lives freely with a consenting woman".&lt;ref&gt;A description of a "community of wives" which Diogenes Laërtius uses when discussing the views of [[Diogenes of Sinope]] {{harv|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few other statements from the ''Republic'' are preserved by other writers. We learn from Laërtius that Zeno stated that the wise man will marry and produce children,{{sfn|Laërtius|1925b|loc=§ 121}} and several writers mention Zeno's view that there is no need to build temples to the gods, "for a temple not worth much is also not sacred, and nothing made by builders or workmen is worth much".&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On Stoic self-contradictions'', 1034B; [[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Stromata]]'', v.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athenaeus]] also preserves a quote on the need for a city to be built on the principle of love:
{{quote|And Pontianus said that Zeno of Citium thought that [[Eros|Love]] was the God of Friendship and Liberty and the author of concord among people, but nothing else. Hence, he says in his ''Republic'', that "Love is a God, who cooperates in securing the safety of the city."&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophists'', xiii. 561C.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reception==
Zeno's ''Republic'' seems to have been viewed with some embarrassment by some of the later Stoics. This was not helped when [[Chrysippus]], Zeno's most illustrious successor as the [[scholarch|head]] of the Stoic school, wrote his own treatise ''On the Republic'' (probably a commentary on Zeno's work), in which (among many other things) he defended both [[incest]] and [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', 3.205, 3.247; Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 188&lt;/ref&gt; It is unlikely that Chrysippus urged the adoption of such behaviors; Chrysippus was probably responding to criticisms that in a society practicing [[free love]], in which people often did not know who their relatives were, rare instances of incest would unintentionally occur; his discussion of cannibalism is probably connected with the Stoic contempt for dead bodies as an empty shell. Nevertheless, these points provided extra ammunition for those people who wished to attack both Zeno and Stoicism in general. Some blamed the influence which [[Crates of Thebes]], the famous [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosopher and teacher of Zeno, may have had when he wrote the ''Republic'': it was joked that Zeno "had written it at the tail of the dog."&lt;ref&gt;The word "Cynic" is derived from the word for "dog" {{harv|Laërtius|1925b|loc=§ 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1st century BC, there was an attempt among the Stoics to downplay the involvement which Cynic philosophy had played in the development of early Stoicism; it was said that Zeno had been "young and thoughtless" when he wrote his ''Republic''.&lt;ref&gt;A view attributed to some contemporary Stoics by [[Philodemus]], ''On the Stoics'', c. 2. col 9. ed. Dorandi.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also said that "by Zeno things were written which they [the Stoics] do not readily allow disciples to read, without their first giving proof whether or not they are genuine philosophers."&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, ''Stromata'', v.9.58&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of these views, it is clear that Zeno was one of the first philosophers in a long tradition begun by Plato of depicting an ideal society in order to understand ethical principles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9810">In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''Reynolds stress''' is the component of the [[Cauchy stress tensor|total stress tensor]] in a [[fluid]] obtained from the averaging operation over the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] to account for [[turbulence|turbulent]] fluctuations in fluid [[momentum]].

==Definition==
The [[flow velocity|velocity field of a flow]] can be split into a mean part and a fluctuating part using [[Reynolds decomposition]]. We write

:&lt;math&gt;u_i = \overline{u_i} + u_i',\,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; being the flow velocity vector having components &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; coordinate direction (with &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; denoting the components of the coordinate vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;). The mean velocities &lt;math&gt;\overline{u_i}&lt;/math&gt; are determined by either time [[average|averaging]], spatial averaging or [[ensemble average|ensemble averaging]], depending on the flow under study. Further &lt;math&gt;u'_i&lt;/math&gt; denotes the fluctuating (turbulence) part of the velocity.

We consider a homogeneous fluid, whose [[density]] ''ρ'' is taken to be a constant. For such a fluid, the components ''τ'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; of the Reynolds stress tensor are defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau'_{ij} \equiv \rho\,\overline{ u'_i\, u'_j},\,&lt;/math&gt;

Another – often used – definition, for constant density, of the Reynolds stress components is:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau''_{ij} \equiv \overline{u'_i\, u'_j},\,&lt;/math&gt;

which has the dimensions of velocity squared, instead of stress.

==Averaging and the Reynolds stress==

To illustrate, [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian]] [[Euclidean vector|vector]] index notation is used. For simplicity, consider an [[incompressible flow|incompressible fluid]]:

Given the fluid velocity &lt;math&gt; u_i &lt;/math&gt; as a function of position and time, write the average fluid velocity as &lt;math&gt;\overline{u_i}&lt;/math&gt;, and the velocity fluctuation is &lt;math&gt;u'_i&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;u_i = \overline{u_i} + u'_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The conventional [[ensemble average|ensemble]] rules of averaging are that

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \overline{\bar a}   &amp;= \bar a, \\
    \overline{a + b}    &amp;= \bar a + \bar b, \\
    \overline{a \bar b} &amp;= \bar a \bar b.
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

One splits the [[Euler equations]] or the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] into an average and a fluctuating part. One finds that upon averaging the fluid equations, a stress on the right hand side appears of the form &lt;math&gt; \rho \overline{ u'_i u'_j} &lt;/math&gt;. This is the Reynolds stress, conventionally written &lt;math&gt; R_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; R_{ij} \ \equiv\   \rho \overline{ u'_i u'_j} &lt;/math&gt;

The [[divergence]] of this stress is the force density on the fluid due to the turbulent fluctuations.

==Reynolds averaging of the Navier–Stokes equations==

{{Main|Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations}}

For instance, for an incompressible, [[viscosity|viscous]], [[Newtonian fluid]], the [[continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|continuity]] and [[momentum]] equations—the incompressible [[Navier–Stokes equations]]—can be written (in a non-conservative form) as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_i}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \frac{Du_i}{Dt} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_i} + \mu \left(
\frac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial x_j \partial x_j} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D/Dt&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lagrangian derivative]] or the [[substantial derivative]],

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{Dt} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + u_j \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Defining the flow variables above with a time-averaged component and a fluctuating component, the continuity and momentum equations become

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial x_i} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \left[ \frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial t} + \left( \overline{u_j} + u_j' \right) \frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial x_j} \right] = -\frac{\partial \left( \bar{p} + p' \right) }{\partial x_i} + \mu \left[ \frac{\partial^2 \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial x_j \partial x_j} \right].&lt;/math&gt;

Examining one of the terms on the left hand side of the momentum equation, it is seen that

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \overline{u_j} + u_j' \right) \frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial x_j} = \frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right) \left( \overline{u_j} +
u_j' \right)}{\partial x_j} - \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right) \frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_j} + u_j' \right)}{\partial x_j}, &lt;/math&gt;

where the last term on the right hand side vanishes as a result of the continuity equation. Accordingly, the momentum equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \left[ \frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right) \left( \overline{u_j} + u_j' \right) }{\partial x_j} \right] = 
-\frac{\partial \left( \bar{p} + p' \right) }{\partial x_i} + \mu \left[ \frac{\partial^2 \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial x_j \partial x_j} \right].&lt;/math&gt;

Now the continuity and momentum equations will be averaged. The ensemble rules of averaging need to be employed, keeping in mind that the average of products of fluctuating quantities will not in general vanish. After averaging, the continuity and momentum equations become

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_i} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \left[ \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}\, \overline{u_j}}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial \overline{u_i' u_j'}}{\partial x_j} \right] =  -\frac{\partial \bar{p}}{\partial x_i} + \mu \frac{\partial^2 \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j \partial
  x_j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the chain rule on one of the terms of the left hand side, it is revealed that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \overline{u_i}\, \overline{u_j}}{\partial x_j} = \overline{u_j} \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j} + \overline{u_i} {\frac{\partial \overline{u_j}}{\partial x_j}},&lt;/math&gt;

where the last term on the right hand side vanishes as a result of the averaged continuity equation. The averaged momentum equation now becomes, after a rearrangement:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \left[ \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial t} + \overline{u_j} \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j} \right] = - \frac{\partial \bar{p}}{\partial x_i} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \left( \mu \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j} - \rho \overline{u_i' u_j'} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the Reynolds stresses, &lt;math&gt;\rho \overline{u_i' u_j'}&lt;/math&gt;, are collected with the viscous normal and shear stress terms, &lt;math&gt;\mu \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Discussion ==
The question then is, what is the value of the Reynolds stress? This has been the subject of intense modeling and interest, for roughly the past century. The problem is recognized as a [[Moment closure|closure problem]], akin to the problem of closure in the [[BBGKY hierarchy]]. A [[transport equation]] for the Reynolds stress may be found by taking the [[outer product]] of the fluid equations for the fluctuating velocity, with itself.

One finds that the transport equation for the Reynolds stress includes terms with higher-order correlations (specifically, the triple correlation &lt;math&gt; \overline{v'_i v'_j v'_k} &lt;/math&gt;) as well as correlations with pressure fluctuations (i.e. momentum carried by sound waves). A common solution is to model these terms by simple ''ad hoc'' prescriptions.

It should also be noted that the theory of the Reynolds stress is quite analogous to the [[kinetic theory of gases]], and indeed the stress tensor in a fluid at a point may be seen to be the ensemble average of the stress due to the thermal velocities of molecules at a given point in a fluid. Thus, by analogy, the Reynolds stress is sometimes thought of as consisting of an isotropic pressure part, termed the turbulent pressure, and an off-diagonal part which may be thought of as an effective turbulent viscosity.

In fact, while much effort has been expended in developing good models for the Reynolds stress in a fluid, as a practical matter, when solving the fluid equations using computational fluid dynamics, often the simplest turbulence models prove the most effective. One class of models, closely related to the concept of turbulent viscosity, are the [[k-epsilon turbulence model]]s, based upon coupled transport equations for the turbulent energy density &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; (similar to the turbulent pressure, i.e. the trace of the Reynolds stress) and the turbulent dissipation rate &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;.

Typically, the average is formally defined as an ensemble average as in [[statistical ensemble]] theory. However, as a practical matter, the average may also be thought of as a spatial average over some length scale, or a temporal average. Note that, while formally the connection between such averages is justified in [[equilibrium statistical mechanics]] by the [[ergodic theorem]], the statistical mechanics of hydrodynamic turbulence is currently far from understood. In fact, the Reynolds stress at any given point in a turbulent fluid is somewhat subject to interpretation, depending upon how one defines the average.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13317">In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[abstract algebra]], a '''rng''' (or '''[[pseudo-ring]]''' or '''non-unital ring''') is an [[algebraic structure]] satisfying the same properties as a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], without assuming the existence of a multiplicative identity. The term "rng" (pronounced ''rung'') is meant to suggest that it is a "ring" without "i", i.e. without the requirement for an "identity element".

There is no consensus in the community as to whether the existence of a multiplicative identity must be one of the ring axioms (see the [[Ring (mathematics)#History|history section]] of the article on [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]]). The term "rng" was coined to alleviate this ambiguity when people want to refer explicitly to a ring without the axiom of multiplicative identity.

A number of algebras of functions considered in [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] are not unital, for instance the algebra of functions decreasing to zero at infinity, especially those with [[compact support]] on some (non-[[compact space|compact]]) space.

{{Algebraic structures |Ring}}

== Definition ==

Formally, a '''rng''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''R'' with two [[binary operations]] {{nowrap|(+, ·)}} called ''addition'' and ''multiplication'' such that
* (''R'', +) is an [[abelian group]],
* (''R'', ·) is a [[semigroup]],
* Multiplication [[distributive law|distributes]] over addition.

Rng [[homomorphism]]s are defined in the same way as [[ring homomorphism]]s except that the requirement {{nowrap|1=''f''(1) = 1}} is dropped. That is, a '''rng homomorphism''' is a function {{nowrap|''f'': ''R'' → ''S''}} from one rng to another such that
* ''f''(''x'' + ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') + ''f''(''y'')
* ''f''(''x'' · ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') · ''f''(''y'')
for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R''.

== Examples ==

All rings are rngs. A simple example of a rng that is not a ring is given by the [[even number|even integers]] with the ordinary addition and multiplication of integers. Another example is given by the set of all 3-by-3 real [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] whose bottom row is zero. Both of these examples are instances of the general fact that every (one- or two-sided) [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] is a rng.

Rngs often appear naturally in [[functional analysis]] when [[linear operator]]s on infinite-[[dimension (linear algebra)|dimensional]] [[vector space]]s are considered.  Take for instance any infinite-dimensional vector space ''V'' and consider the set of all linear operators {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' → ''V''}} with finite [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] (i.e. {{nowrap|dim ''f''(''V'') &lt; ∞}}). Together with addition and [[functional composition|composition]] of operators, this is a rng, but not a ring. Another example is the rng of all real [[sequence]]s that [[limit of a sequence|converge to]] 0, with component-wise operations.

Also, many [[test function]] spaces occurring in the [[theory of distributions]] consist of functions
decreasing to zero at infinity, like e.g. [[Schwartz space]]. Thus, the function everywhere equal to one, which would be the only possible identity element for pointwise multiplication, cannot exist in such spaces, which therefore are rngs (for pointwise addition and multiplication). In particular, the real-valued [[continuous function]]s with [[compact space|compact]] [[support (mathematics)|support]] defined on some [[topological space]], together with pointwise addition and multiplication, form a rng; this is not a ring unless the underlying space is [[compact space|compact]].

== Properties ==

Ideals and [[quotient ring]]s can be defined for rngs in the same manner as for rings. The ideal theory of rngs is complicated by the fact that a nonzero rng, unlike a nonzero ring, need not contain any [[maximal ideal]]s. Some theorems of [[ring theory]] are false for rngs.

A rng homomorphism {{nowrap|''f'': ''R'' → ''S''}} maps any [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent element]] to an idempotent element; this applies in particular to 1&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; if it exists.

If ''R'' and ''S'' are rings, a rng homomorphism {{nowrap|''f'': ''R'' → ''S''}} whose image contains a non-zero-divisor maps 1&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; to 1&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Adjoining an identity element ==

Every rng ''R'' can be turned into a ring ''R''^ by adjoining an identity element.  The most general way in which to do this is to formally add an identity element 1 and let ''R''^ consist of integral linear combinations of 1 and elements of ''R''.  That is, elements of ''R''^ are of the form
:''n'' &amp;middot; 1 + ''r''
where ''n'' is an [[integer]] and {{nowrap|''r'' ∈ ''R''}}.  Multiplication is defined by linearity:
:(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;middot; (''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

More formally, we can take ''R''^ to be the [[cartesian product]] {{nowrap|'''Z''' × ''R''}} and define addition and multiplication by
:(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + (''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;),
:(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;middot; (''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
The multiplicative identity of ''R''^ is then {{nowrap|(1, 0)}}.  There is a natural rng homomorphism {{nowrap|''j'' : ''R'' → ''R''^}} defined by {{nowrap|1=''j''(''r'') = (0, ''r'')}}.  This map has the following [[universal property]]:
:Given any ring ''S'' and any rng homomorphism {{nowrap|''f'' : ''R'' → ''S''}}, there exists a unique ring homomorphism {{nowrap|''g'' : ''R''^ → ''S''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''f'' = ''gj''}}.
The map ''g'' can be defined by {{nowrap|1=''g''(''n'', ''r'') = ''n'' · 1&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''f''(''r'')}}.  In a sense then, ''R''^ is "the most general" ring containing ''R''.

There is a natural surjective ring homomorphism {{nowrap|''R''^ → '''Z'''}} which sends {{nowrap|(''n'', ''r'')}} to ''n''.  The [[kernel (ring theory)|kernel]] of this homomorphism is the image of ''R'' in ''R''^.  Since ''j'' is injective, we see that ''R'' is embedded as a (two-sided) [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in ''R''^ with the [[quotient ring]] ''R''^/''R'' isomorphic to '''Z'''.  It follows that
:''Every rng is an ideal in some ring, and every ideal of a ring is a rng.''

Note that ''j'' is never surjective.  So even when ''R'' already has an identity element the ring ''R''^ will be a larger one with a different identity.

The process of adjoining an identity element to a rng can be formulated in the language of [[category theory]].  If we denote the [[category of all rings]] and ring homomorphisms by '''Ring''' and the category of all rngs and rng homomorphisms by '''Rng''', then '''Ring''' is a (nonfull) [[subcategory]] of '''Rng'''.  The construction of ''R''^ given above yields a [[left adjoint]] to the  [[inclusion functor]] {{nowrap|''I'' : '''Ring''' → '''Rng'''}}.  This means that '''Ring''' is a [[reflective subcategory]] of '''Rng''' with reflector {{nowrap|''j'' : ''R'' → ''R''^}}.

== Properties weaker than having an identity ==

There are several properties that have been considered in the literature that are weaker than having an identity element, but not so general. 
For example:

* Rings with enough idempotents: A rng ''R'' is said to be a ring with enough idempotents when there exists a subset ''E'' of ''R'' given by idempotents (i.e. {{nowrap|1=''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e''}} for all ''e'' in ''E'') orthogonal (i.e. {{nowrap|1=''ef'' = 0}} for all {{nowrap|''e'' ≠ ''f''}} in ''E'') such that {{nowrap|1=''R'' = {{big|⊕}}&lt;sub&gt;''e''∈''E''&lt;/sub&gt; ''eR'' = {{big|⊕}}&lt;sub&gt;''e''∈''E''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Re''}}.
* Rings with local units: A rng ''R'' is said to be a ring with local units in case for every finite set ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''r&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''R'' we can find ''e'' in ''R'' such that {{nowrap|1=''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e''}} and {{nowrap|1=''er&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;e''}} for every ''i''.
* ''s''-unital rings: A rng ''R'' is said to be ''s''-unital in case for every finite set ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''r&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''R'' we can find ''s'' in ''R'' such that {{nowrap|1=''sr&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;s''}} for every ''i''.
* Firm rings: A rng ''R'' is said to be firm if the canonical homomorphism {{nowrap|''R'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ''R'' → ''R''}} given by {{nowrap|''r'' ⊗ ''s'' ↦ ''rs''}} is an isomorphism.
* Idempotent rings: A rng ''R'' is said to be idempotent (or an irng) in case {{nowrap|1=''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''R''}}, that is, for every element ''r'' of ''R'' we can find elements ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''R'' such that &lt;math&gt;r = \Sigma_i r_i s_i&lt;/math&gt;.

It is not hard to check that these properties are weaker than having an identity element and weaker than the previous one.

* Rings are rings with enough idempotents, using {{nowrap|1=''E'' = {1}.}} A ring with enough idempotents that has no identity is for example the ring of infinite matrices over a field with just a finite number of nonzero entries. The matrices that have just 1 over one element in the main diagonal and 0 otherwise are the orthogonal idempotents.
* Rings with enough idempotents are rings with local units just taking finite sums of the orthogonal idempotents to satisfy the definition.
* Rings with local units are in particular ''s''-unital; ''s''-unital rings are firm and firm rings are idempotent.

== Rng of square zero ==

A '''rng of square zero''' is a rng ''R'' such that {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = 0}} for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;See Bourbaki, p.&amp;nbsp;102, where it is called a pseudo-ring of square zero.  Some other authors use the term "zero ring" to refer to any rng of square zero; see e.g. {{harvtxt|Szele|1949}} and {{harvtxt|Kreinovich|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Any [[abelian group]] can be made a rng of square zero by defining the multiplication so that {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = 0}} for all ''x'' and ''y'';&lt;ref&gt;Bourbaki, p.&amp;nbsp;102.&lt;/ref&gt; thus every abelian group is the additive group of some rng.
The only rng of square zero with a multiplicative identity is the [[zero ring]] {0}.&lt;ref&gt;Bourbaki, p.&amp;nbsp;102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any additive [[subgroup]] of a rng of square zero is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]].  Thus a rng of square zero is [[simple ring|simple]] if and only if its additive group is a simple abelian group, i.e., a [[cyclic group]] of prime order.&lt;ref&gt;Zariski and Samuel, p.&amp;nbsp;133.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unital homomorphism ==

Given two unital algebras ''A'' and ''B'', an algebra [[homomorphism]]

:''f'' : ''A'' → ''B''

is '''unital''' if it maps the identity element of ''A'' to the identity element of ''B''.

If the associative algebra ''A'' over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' is ''not'' unital, one can adjoin an identity element as follows: take {{nowrap|''A'' × ''K''}} as underlying ''K''-[[vector space]] and define multiplication ∗ by

:(''x'',''r'') ∗ (''y'',''s'') = (''xy'' + ''sx'' + ''ry'', ''rs'')

for ''x'',''y'' in ''A'' and ''r'',''s'' in ''K''. Then ∗ is an associative operation with identity element (0,1). The old algebra ''A'' is contained in the new one, and in fact {{nowrap|1=''A'' × ''K''}} is the "most general" unital algebra containing ''A'', in the sense of [[universal construction]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7002">[[File:Self-regulated learning.png|thumb|300px|A feedback model of the motivation-volition process. Lower labels are terminology of Zimmerman.&lt;ref name=Schmitz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zimmerman/&gt;]]
In [[cognitive psychology|psychological]] theories of [[motivation]], the '''Rubicon model''', more completely the '''Rubicon model of action phases''', makes a distinction between motivational and volitional processes. The Rubicon model "defines clear boundaries between motivational and action phases". The first boundary "separates the motivational process of the predecisional phase from the volitional processes of postdecisional phase."&lt;ref name=Achtziger/&gt;  Another boundary is that between initiation and conclusion of an action.&lt;ref name=Achtziger/&gt; A self-regulatory feedback model incorporating these interfaces was proposed later by others, as illustrated in the figure.&lt;ref name=Schmitz/&gt;

The name "Rubicon model" derives from the tale of Caesar's [[Point of no return|crossing the Rubicon River]], a point of no return, thereby revealing his intentions. According to the Rubicon model, every action includes such a point of no return at which the individual moves from goal setting to goal striving.&lt;ref name=Rauber/&gt;&lt;ref name=Corno/&gt;
:"Once subjects move from planning and goal-setting to the implementation of plans, they cross a metaphorical Rubicon. That is, their goals are typically protected and fostered by self-regulatory activity rather than reconsidered or changed, often even when challenged."
::— Lyn Corno, ''The best laid plans'', p. 15 (quoted by Rauber)

The Rubicon model addresses four questions, as identified by Achtziger and [[Peter Gollwitzer|Gollwitzer]]:&lt;ref name=Achtziger/&gt;
#How do people select their goals?
#How do they plan the execution of their goals?
#How do they enact their plans?
#How do they evaluate their efforts to accomplish a specific goal?

The study of these issues is undertaken by both the fields of [[cognitive neuroscience]] and [[social psychology]]. A possible connection between these approaches is brain imaging work attempting to relate volition to [[neuroanatomy]].&lt;ref name=Brass/&gt;

==Background==
Human action coordinates such aspects of human behavior as perception, thought, emotion, and skills to classify goals as attainable or unattainable and then to engage or disengage in trying to attain these goals. According to Heckhausen &amp; Heckhausen,&lt;ref name=Heckhausen/&gt; "Research based on the Rubicon model of action phases has provided a wealth of empirical evidence for mental and behavioral resources being orchestrated in this manner." Engagement and disengagement with goals affects personal distress over the unachievable. "By having new goals available, and reengaging in those new goals, a person can reduce distress....while continuing to derive a sense of purpose in life by finding other pursuits of value."&lt;ref name=Wrosch/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34240">'''Social behavior''' is [[behavior]] among two or more [[Organism|organisms]], and encompasses any behavior in which one member effects another within the same species. This is due to an [[interaction]] among those members. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/the-laboratory-rat/suckow/978-0-12-074903-4|title=The Laboratory Rat - 2nd Edition|last=Elsevier|website=www.elsevier.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/handbook-of-biologically-active-peptides/kastin/978-0-12-385095-9|title=Handbook of Biologically Active Peptides - 2nd Edition|last=Elsevier|website=www.elsevier.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social behavior can be seen as similar to an exchange of goods, with the expectation that when you give, you will receive the same. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Homans|first=George C.|date=1958|title=Social Behavior as Exchange|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2772990|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=63|issue=6|pages=597–606}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior can be effected by both the qualities of the individual, along with environmental (situational) factors, and result from an interaction between the two. This means that, in regards to humans, social behavior can be determined by both the individual characteristics of the person, and the situation they are in. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Mark|last2=Ickes|first2=W.|date=1985|title=Personality and social behavior|url=https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/personality-and-social-behavior|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major aspect of social behavior is [[communication]], which is the basis for survival and [[reproduction]] due to the need for interaction. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Gene E.|last2=Fernald|first2=Russell D.|last3=Clayton|first3=David F.|date=2008-11-07|title=Genes and Social Behavior|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/322/5903/896|journal=Science|language=en|volume=322|issue=5903|pages=896–900|doi=10.1126/science.1159277|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18988841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social behavior is said to be determined by two different processes, that can either work together or oppose one another. The dual-systems model of reflective and impulsive determinants of social behavior came out of the realization that behavior cannot just be determined by one single factor, whether that be consciously behaving or by pure impulse. Instead, these factors that determine behavior can work in different situations and moments, and even oppose one another. While at times one can behave with a specific goal in mind, other times they can behave without rational control, and driven by impulse instead. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strack|first=Fritz|last2=Deutsch|first2=Roland|date=2004|title=Reflective and impulsive determinants of social behavior|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15454347|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review: An Official Journal of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc|volume=8|issue=3|pages=220–247|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0803_1|issn=1088-8683|pmid=15454347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also distinctions between different types of social behavior, such as [[mundane]] versus [[defence mechanisms|defensive]] social behavior. Mundane social behavior is a result of interactions in day-to-day life, and are behaviors learned as one is exposed to different situations. On the other hand, defensive behavior arises out of impulse, when one is faced with conflicting desires. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whiting|first=Beatrice Blyth|date=1980|title=Culture and Social Behavior: A Model for the Development of Social Behavior|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/640018|journal=Ethos|volume=8|issue=2|pages=95–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Development of Social Behavior ==
'''Social behavior''' constantly changes as one continues to grow and develop, reaching different stages of life. The development of behavior is deeply tied with the biological and cognitive changes one is experiencing at any given time, and thus creates general patterns of social behavior development in humans. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/childrens-social-behavior/strain/978-0-12-673455-3|title=Children's Social Behavior - 1st Edition|last=Elsevier|website=www.elsevier.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as social behavior is influenced by both the situation and an individual's characteristics, the development of behavior is due to the combination of the two as well--the [[temperament]] of the child along with the settings they are exposed to. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothbart|first=Mary K.|last2=Ahadi|first2=Stephan A.|last3=Hershey|first3=Karen L.|date=1994|title=Temperament and Social Behavior in Childhood|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23087906|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|volume=40|issue=1|pages=21–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whiting|first=Beatrice Blyth|date=1980|title=Culture and Social Behavior: A Model for the Development of Social Behavior|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/640018|journal=Ethos|volume=8|issue=2|pages=95–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Culture]] (parents and individuals that influence socialization in children) play a large role in the development of a child's social behavior, as the parents or caregivers are typically those who decide the settings and situations that the child is exposed to. These various settings the child is placed in (for example, the playground and classroom) form habits of interaction and behavior insomuch as the child being exposed to certain settings more frequently than others. What takes particular precedence in the influence of the setting are the people that the child must interact with--their age, sex, and at times culture. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Emotions also plays a large role in the development of social behavior, as it is intertwined with the way an individual behaves. Through social interactions, emotion is understood through various verbal and nonverbal displays, and thus plays a large role in communication. Many of the processes that occur in the brain and underly emotion often greatly correlate with the processes that are needed for social behavior as well. A major aspect of interaction is understanding how the other person thinks and feels, and being able to detect emotional states becomes necessary for individuals to effectively interact with one another and behave socially. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/advances-in-child-development-and-behavior/kail/978-0-12-374317-6|title=Advances in Child Development and Behavior, Volume 36 - 1st Edition|last=Elsevier|website=www.elsevier.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the child continues to gain social information, their behavior develops accordingly. &lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Gene E.|last2=Fernald|first2=Russell D.|last3=Clayton|first3=David F.|date=2008-11-07|title=Genes and Social Behavior|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/322/5903/896|journal=Science|language=en|volume=322|issue=5903|pages=896–900|doi=10.1126/science.1159277|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18988841}}&lt;/ref&gt; One must learn how to behave according to the interactions and people relevant to a certain setting, and therefore begin to intuitively know the appropriate form of social interaction depending on the situation. Therefore, behavior is constantly changing as required, and maturity brings this on. A child must learn to balance their own desires with those of the people they interact with, and this ability to correctly respond to contextual cues and understand the intentions and desires of another person improves with age. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; That being said, the individual characteristics of the child (their temperament) is important to understanding how the individual learns social behaviors and cues given to them, and this learnability is not consistent across all children. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Patterns of Development Across the Lifespan ===
When studying patterns of biological development across the human lifespan, there are certain patterns that are well-maintained across humans. These patterns can often correspond with social development, and biological changes lead to respective changes in interactions. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In '''pre and post-natal infancy,''' the behavior of the infant is correlated with that of the mother. In infancy, there is already a development of the awareness of a stranger, in which case the individual is able to identify and distinguish between people. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Come '''childhood,''' the individual begins to attend more to their peers, and communication begins to take a verbal form. One also begins to classify themselves on the basis of their own gender and other qualities salient about themselves, like race and age. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

When the child reaches '''school age,''' one typically becomes more aware of the structure within society in regards to gender, and how their own gender plays a role in this. They become increasingly reliant on verbal forms of communication, and more likely to form groups and awareness of their own role within the group. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

By '''puberty,''' general relations among same and opposite sex individuals are much more salient, and individuals begin to behave according to the norms of these situations. With the increasing awareness of their sex and thus stereotypes that go along with it, the individual begins to choose how much they align with these stereotypes and thus behaves either according to those stereotypes or not. This is also the time that individuals more often form sexual pairs. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Once the individual reaches '''childrearing''' age, one must begin to undergo changes within the own behavior in accordance to major life-changes of a developing family. The potential new child requires the parent to modify their behavior to accommodate a new member of the family. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Come '''senescence''' and '''retirement,''' behavior is more stable as the individual as often established their social circle (whatever it may be) and is more committed to their social structure. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

With the advent of the field '''social cognitive neuroscience''' came interest in studying social behavior's correlates within the brain, to see what is happening beneath the surface as organisms act in a social manner. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behrens|first=Timothy E. J.|last2=Hunt|first2=Laurence T.|last3=Rushworth|first3=Matthew F. S.|date=2009-05-29|title=The Computation of Social Behavior|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5931/1160|journal=Science|language=en|volume=324|issue=5931|pages=1160–1164|doi=10.1126/science.1169694|issn=0036-8075|pmid=19478175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is debate about which particular regions of the brain are responsible for social behavior, some have claimed that the paracingulate cortex is activated when one person is thinking about the motives or aims of another, a means of understanding the social world and behaving accordingly. The medial prefrontal lobe was also been seen to have activation during social cognition &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amodio|first=David M.|last2=Frith|first2=Chris D.|date=April 2006|title=Meeting of minds: the medial frontal cortex and social cognition|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1884|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|language=En|volume=7|issue=4|pages=268–277|doi=10.1038/nrn1884|issn=1471-003X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also discovered through studies on [[Rhesus macaque|rhesus monkeys]] that the [[amygdala]]''',''' a region known for expressing fear, was activated specifically when the monkeys were faced with a social situation they had never been in before. This region of the brain was shown to be sensitive to the fear that comes with a novel social situation, inhibiting social interaction. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amaral|first=David G.|date=December 2003|title=The amygdala, social behavior, and danger detection|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14766647|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1000|pages=337–347|issn=0077-8923|pmid=14766647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of studying which brain regions may be responsible for social behavior has been through looking at patients with brain injuries who have an impairment in social behavior. Lesions in the [[prefrontal cortex]] that occurs in adulthood can effect the functioning of social behavior. When these lesions or a dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex occur in infancy/early on in life, the development of proper moral and social behavior is effected and thus atypical. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Steven W.|last2=Bechara|first2=Antoine|last3=Damasio|first3=Hanna|last4=Tranel|first4=Daniel|last5=Damasio|first5=Antonio R.|date=November 1999|title=Impairment of social and moral behavior related to early damage in human prefrontal cortex|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1199_1032|journal=Nature Neuroscience|language=En|volume=2|issue=11|pages=1032–1037|doi=10.1038/14833|issn=1097-6256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological Correlates ===
[[File:Prairie vole.gif|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prairie%20vole.gif|thumb|A prairie vole]]
Along with neural correlates, research has investigated what happens within the body (and potentially modulates) social behavior. [[Vasopressin]] is a [[posterior pituitary]] [[hormone]] that is seen to potentially play a role in affiliation for young rats. Along with young rats, vasopressin has also been associated with paternal behavior in [[Prairie vole|prairie voles]]. Research has tried to connect animal research to humans, and found that vasopressin ''may'' play a role in the social responses of males in human research. &lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Positive_Psychology.html?id=TLtRmAEACAAJ|title=Handbook of Positive Psychology|last=Snyder|first=C. R.|last2=Lopez|first2=Shane J.|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195135336|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oxytocin]] was also correlated with positive social behavior, and elevated levels were even seen to work to potentially help improve social behavior that may have been suppressed due to stress. Thus, targeting levels of oxytocin may play a role in interventions of disorders that deal with atypical social behavior. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-01-01|title=Peptides and Behavior|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123850959002542|journal=Handbook of Biologically Active Peptides|language=en|pages=1858–1863|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-385095-9.00254-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with vasopressin, [[serotonin]] has also been inspected in relation to social behavior in humans. It was found to be associated with human feelings of social connection, and we see a drop in serotonin when one is socially isolated or has feelings of social isolation. Serotonin has also been associated with social confidence. &lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

== Affect and Social Behavior ==
[[Positive affectivity|Positive affect]] (emotion) has been seen to have a large impact on social behavior, particularly by inducing more helping behavior, [[cooperation]], and sociability. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=xFc1oeDgOZ0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA203&amp;ots=MXXkHCmW4l&amp;sig=0pB2499gMjgi1aA27mcp6GR70Qo#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1987-11-05|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780080567341|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that even subtly inducing [[Positive affectivity|positive affect]] within individuals caused greater social behavior and helping. This phenomena, however, is not one-directional. Just as positive affect can influence social behavior, social behavior can have an influence on positive affect. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Isen|first=Alice M.|last2=Levin|first2=Paula F.|date=1972|title=Effect of feeling good on helping: Cookies and kindness.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0032317|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=384–388|doi=10.1037/h0032317|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronic Media and Social Behavior ==
Social behavior has typically been seen as a changing of behaviors relevant to the situation at hand, acting appropriately with the setting one is in. However, with the advent of electronic media, people began to find themselves in situations they may have not been exposed to in everyday life. Novel situations and information presented through electronic media has formed interactions that are completely new to people. While people typically behaved in line with their setting, the lines were now becoming blurred. This led to a cascade of results, as gender norms started to merge, and people were coming in contact with information they had never been exposed to through face-to-face interaction. A political leader could no longer tailor a speech to just one audience, for their speech would be translated and heard by anyone through the media. People can no longer play drastically different roles when put in different situations, because the situations overlap more and information is more readily available. Communication flows more quickly and fluidly through media, causing behavior to merge accordingly. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RMrQCwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=types+of+social+behavior&amp;ots=Q6mw4_keQ5&amp;sig=B7eK6e-Bqe75zNciNTKAgux1_yA#v=onepage&amp;q=conclusion&amp;f=false|title=No Sense of Place: The Impact of Electronic Media on Social Behavior|last=Meyrowitz|first=Joshua|date=1986-12-11|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198020578|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media has also been shown to have an impact on promoting different types of social behavior, such as prosocial and aggressive behavior. For example, violence shown through the media has been seen to lead to more aggressive behavior in its viewers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Craig A.|last2=Shibuya|first2=Akiko|last3=Ihori|first3=Nobuko|last4=Swing|first4=Edward L.|last5=Bushman|first5=Brad J.|last6=Sakamoto|first6=Akira|last7=Rothstein|first7=Hannah R.|last8=Saleem|first8=Muniba|date=2010|title=Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in Eastern and Western countries: A meta-analytic review.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0018251|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=136|issue=2|pages=151–173|doi=10.1037/a0018251|issn=1939-1455}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bushman|first=Brad J.|last2=Huesmann|first2=L.

In various studies looking specifically at how video games with prosocial content effect behavior, it was shown that exposure influenced subsequent helping behavior in the video-game player. &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; The processes that underly this effect point to the prosocial thoughts being more readily available after playing a video game related to this, and thus the person playing the game is more likely to behave accordingly. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greitemeyer|first=Tobias|last2=Osswald|first2=Silvia|date=2010|title=Effects of prosocial video games on prosocial behavior.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0016997|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=98|issue=2|pages=211–221|doi=10.1037/a0016997|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greitemeyer|first=Tobias|last2=Osswald|first2=Silvia|date=2011-02-17|title=Playing Prosocial Video Games Increases the Accessibility of Prosocial Thoughts|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00224540903365588|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=151|issue=2|pages=121–128|doi=10.1080/00224540903365588|issn=0022-4545}}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects were not only found with video games, but also with music, as people listening to songs involving aggression and violence in the lyrics were more likely to act in an aggressive manner. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Peter|last2=Greitemeyer|first2=Tobias|date=September 2006|title=Music and Aggression: The Impact of Sexual-Aggressive Song Lyrics on Aggression-Related Thoughts, Emotions, and Behavior Toward the Same and the Opposite Sex|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0146167206288670|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=32|issue=9|pages=1165–1176|doi=10.1177/0146167206288670|issn=0146-1672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, people listening to songs related to prosocial acts (relative to a song with neutral lyrics) were shown to express greater helping behaviors and more empathy afterwards. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greitemeyer|first=Tobias|date=January 2009|title=Effects of songs with prosocial lyrics on prosocial thoughts, affect, and behavior|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2008.08.003|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=45|issue=1|pages=186–190|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.08.003|issn=0022-1031}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greitemeyer|first=Tobias|date=2009-07-31|title=Effects of Songs With Prosocial Lyrics on Prosocial Behavior: Further Evidence and a Mediating Mechanism|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0146167209341648|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=35|issue=11|pages=1500–1511|doi=10.1177/0146167209341648|issn=0146-1672}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these songs were played at restaurants, it even led to an increase in tips given (relative to those who heard neutral lyrics). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Céline|last2=Guéguen|first2=Nicolas|last3=Boulbry|first3=Gaëlle|date=December 2010|title=Effects of songs with prosocial lyrics on tipping behavior in a restaurant|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2010.02.004|journal=International Journal of Hospitality Management|volume=29|issue=4|pages=761–763|doi=10.1016/j.ijhm.2010.02.004|issn=0278-4319}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Autism Spectrum Disorder ===
''Main Article:'' [[Autism spectrum|Autism Spectrum Disorder]]

Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder that effects the functioning of social interaction and communication. People who fall on the autism spectrum scale may have difficulties in understanding social cues and the emotional states of others. Due to this, one may find it difficult to modulate behavior according to the situation, and acting according to the setting's standards. &lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/terminology/icd_10/en/|title=WHO {{!}} ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders|website=www.who.int|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the spectrum of autism includes [[Asperger syndrome|Aspergers Syndrome]], which contains the atypical functioning of social interaction and communication seen in autism, but without a clinically significant delay on cognitive and language abilities. &lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008-02-08|title=Structural Variation of Chromosomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929707000353|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|language=en|volume=82|issue=2|pages=477–488|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.12.009|issn=0002-9297}}&lt;/ref&gt;Research is still being done to investigate which brain regions are involved in Autism Spectrum Disorder. &lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-09-01|title=Autism spectrum disorders|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476179306000449|journal=Psychiatry|language=en|volume=5|issue=9|pages=320–324|doi=10.1053/j.mppsy.2006.06.007|issn=1476-1793}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to abnormalities that often occur in Autism Spectrum Disorder, one who classifies as among the spectrum may have a series of symptoms, such as difficulty or inability to maintain eye-contact with another person, and communicate via face and body expression. One may have a hard time forming relationships with their peers, and have a difficult time forming mutual interests with others and sharing a common excitement in something. Language may be impaired to those on the low-end of the spectrum, which effects conversation and communication with others. &lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1555">In the [[statistics|statistical analysis]] of the results from [[factorial experiment]]s, the '''sparsity-of-effects principle''' states that a system is usually dominated by [[main effect]]s and low-order [[Interaction (statistics)|interactions]].  Thus it is most likely that main (single factor) effects and two-factor interactions are the most significant responses in a factorial experiment.  In other words, higher order interactions such as three-factor interactions are very rare.  This is sometimes referred to as the ''hierarchical ordering principle''.&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt;  The sparsity-of-effects principle actually refers to the idea that only a few effects in a factorial experiment will be statistically significant.&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt;

This principle is only valid on the assumption of a factor space far from a stationary point.&lt;ref name=Box/&gt;

'''Subjective well-being''' ('''SWB''') is a self-reported measure of [[well-being]], typically obtained by questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oecd.org/site/worldforum06/38331839.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160107223341/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/well-being/publications/measuring-subjective-well-being-in-the-uk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ed Diener]] developed a tripartite model of subjective well-being in 1984, which describes how people experience the [[quality of life|quality of their lives]] and includes both [[emotion]]al reactions and [[cognitive]] judgments.&lt;ref name="Diener1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Diener|first=Ed| title= Subjective well-being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year= 1984|volume= 95|pages=542–575|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/95/3/542/|issue=3|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.95.3.542|pmid= 6399758}}&lt;/ref&gt; It posits "three distinct but often related components of wellbeing: frequent positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]], infrequent negative [[affect (psychology)|affect]], and cognitive evaluations such as [[life satisfaction]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tov &amp; Diener (2013), ''Subjective Well-Being''. Research Collection School of Social Sciences. Paper 1395. http://ink.library.sju.edu.sg/soss_research/1395&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49658154_A_Review_of_the_Tripartite_Structure_of_Subjective_Well-Being_Implications_for_Conceptualization_Operationalization_Analysis_and_Synthesis&lt;/ref&gt;

SWB therefore encompasses [[mood (psychology)|moods]] and emotions as well as evaluations of one's satisfaction with general and specific areas of one's life.&lt;ref name=Diener1999&gt;{{cite journal|last= Diener|first=Ed |author2=Suh, E.M. |author3=Lucas, R.E. |author4=Smith, H.L|title=Subjective well-being: Three Decades of Progress|journal= Psychological Bulletin |year=1999|volume=125|pages=276–302|url =http://stat.psych.uiuc.edu/~ediener/Documents/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.276|issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts encompassed by SWB include [[happiness]]. 

SWB tends to be stable over time&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; and is strongly related to [[personality psychology|personality traits]].&lt;ref name=Steel&gt;{{cite journal|last= Steel|first=Piers |author2=Schmidt, Joseph |author3=Shultz, Jonas|title=Refining the relationship between personality and Subjective well-being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2008|volume=134|pages=138–161|url=http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y4person/3_happiness/Steel2008_5FM_and_happiness_psych_bull.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.134.1.138|pmid= 18193998|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that health and SWB may mutually influence each other, as good health tends to be associated with greater happiness,&lt;ref name=Okunmeta-analysis/&gt; and a number of studies have found that positive emotions and [[optimism]] can have a beneficial influence on health.&lt;ref name=Dienerhealth/&gt;

==Construction of SWB==
[[Ed Diener|Diener]] et al.  argued that the various components of SWB represent distinct constructs that need to be understood separately, even though they are closely related. Hence, SWB may be considered "a general area of scientific interest rather than a single specific construct".&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; Due to the specific focus on the ''subjective'' aspects of well-being, definitions of SWB typically exclude ''objective'' conditions such as material conditions or [[health]], although these can influence ratings of SWB.&lt;ref name=Diener1984/&gt; Definitions of SWB therefore focus on how a person evaluates his/her own life, including emotional experiences of [[pleasure]] versus [[suffering|pain]] in response to specific events and cognitive evaluations of what a person considers a [[Eudaimonia|good life]].&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt; Components of SWB relating to [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] include positive affect (experiencing pleasant emotions and moods) and low negative affect (experiencing unpleasant, distressing emotions and moods), as well as "overall affect" or "[[valence (psychology)|hedonic]] balance", defined as the overall equilibrium  between positive and negative affect, and usually measured as the difference between the two.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;  High positive affect and low negative affect are often highly correlated, but not always.&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt;

==Components of SWB==
There are two components of SWB. One is [[affect (psychology)|Affective Balance]] and the other is Life Satisfaction. An individual's scores on the two measures are summed to produce a total SWB score. In some cases, these scores are kept separate.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;
* Affective balance
Affective balance refers to the emotions, moods, and feelings a person has. These can be all positive, all negative, or a combination of both positive and negative.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt; Some research shows also that feelings of reward are separate from positive and negative affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = M | last2 = Dolan | first2 = P | year = 2009 | title = Accounting for the richness of our daily activities | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02392.x | pmid = 19549079 | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 8| pages = 1000–1008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Life satisfaction
[[Life satisfaction]] (global judgments of one's life) and satisfaction with specific life domains (e.g. work satisfaction) are considered cognitive components of SWB.&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt; The term "[[happiness]]" is also commonly used in regards to SWB and has been defined variously as "satisfaction of desires and goals" (therefore related to life satisfaction), as a "preponderance of positive over negative affect" (therefore related to emotional components of SWB),&lt;ref name=Diener1984/&gt; as "contentment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a "consistent, [[optimistic]] mood state"&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; and may imply an affective evaluation of one's life as a whole.&lt;ref name=deneve&amp;cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeNeve|first=Kristina M.|author2=Cooper, Harris |title=The Happy Personality: A Meta-Analysis of 137 Personality Traits and Subjective Well-Being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1998|volume=124|pages=197–229|url=http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y5_ID/personality/wellbeing/1998_Deneve_cooper_psych_bull.pdf|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.197|pmid=9747186|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Life satisfaction can also be known as the "stable" component in one's life.&lt;ref name=Diener1984/&gt;  Affective concepts of SWB can be considered in terms of momentary emotional states as well as in terms of longer-term moods and tendencies (i.e. how much positive and/or negative affect a person generally experiences over any given period of time).&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; Life satisfaction and in some research happiness are typically considered over long durations, up to one's lifetime.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; "[[Quality of life]]" has also been studied as a conceptualization of SWB. Although its exact definition varies, it is usually measured as an aggregation of well-being across several life domains and may include both subjective and objective components.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;

===Measurement of SWB components===

Life satisfaction and Affect balance are generally measured separately and independently.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  
* Life satisfaction is generally measured using a self-report method. A common measurement for life satisfaction is questionnaires. 
* Affective balance is also generally measured using a self-report method. An example of a measurement of affective balance is the [[Positive and Negative Affect Schedule|PANAS]] (Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule).&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  
Sometimes a single SWB question attempts to capture an overall picture.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. "''The most basic way of measuring it involves asking individuals how they feel about their lives - known as subjective well being. A typical question is, "Taking all things together, how happy are you?" - with possible answers from 0 (extremely unhappy) to 10 (extremely happy).''" Can Happiness be Measured?, http://www.actionforhappiness.org/why-happiness&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue with the such measurements of life satisfaction and affective balance is that they are self-reports. The problem with self-reports is that the participants may be lying or at least not telling the whole truth on the questionnaires. Participants may be lying or holding back from revealing certain things because they are either embarrassed or they may be filling in what they believe the researcher wants to see in the results. To gain more accurate results, other methods of measurement have been used to determine one’s SWB. 

Another way to corroborate or confirm that the self-report results are accurate is through informant reports.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  Informant reports are given to the participant’s closest friends and family and they are asked to fill out either a survey or a form asking about the participants mood, emotions, and overall lifestyle. The participant may write in the self-report that they are very happy, however that participant’s friends and family record that he/she is always depressed. This would obviously be a contradiction in results which would ultimately lead to inaccurate results. 

Another method of gaining a better understanding of the true results is through ESM, or the Experience Sampling Method.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  In this measure, participants are given a beeper/pager that will randomly ring throughout the day. Whenever the beeper/pager sounds, the participant will stop what he/she is doing and record the activity they are currently engaged in and their current mood and feelings. Tracking this over a period of a week or a month will give researchers a better understanding of the true emotions, moods, and feelings the participant is experiencing, and how these factors interact with other thoughts and behaviors.&lt;ref name= HGIN&gt;{{cite journal |author1=van der Krieke et al., L. | year = 2015 | title = HowNutsAreTheDutch (HoeGekIsNL): A crowdsourcing study of mental symptoms and strengths | journal = International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research | volume = 25| issue = 2| pages = 123–44| doi=10.1002/mpr.1495 | pmid=26395198}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third measurement to ensure validity is the Day Reconstruction Method.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  In this measure, participants fill out a diary of the previous days’ activities. The participant is then asked to describe each activity and provide a report of how they were feeling, what mood they were experiencing, and any emotions that surfaced. Thus to ensure valid results, a researcher may tend to use self-reports along with another form of measurement mentioned above. Someone with a high level of life satisfaction and a positive affective balance is said to have a high level of SWB.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;

==Theories==
Theories of the causes of SWB tend to emphasise either top-down or bottom-up influences.&lt;ref name="Diener1984"/&gt;

===Top-down perspective===

In the top-down view, global features of personality influence the way a person perceives events. Individuals may therefore have a global tendency to perceive life in a consistently positive or negative manner, depending on their stable personality traits.&lt;ref name=deneve1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeNeve|first=Kristina M. |title=Happy as an Extraverted Clam? The Role of Personality for Subjective Well-Being
|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science
|year=1999|volume=8|pages=141–144|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/8/5/141.abstract|issue=5|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Top-down theories of SWB suggest that people have a [[genetic predisposition]] to be happy or unhappy and this predisposition determines their SWB "setpoint". Set Point theory implies that a person's baseline or equilibrium level of SWB is a consequence of hereditary characteristics and therefore, almost entirely predetermined at birth.&lt;ref name="Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lykken|author2=Tellegen |title=Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon|journal=Psychological Science|year=1996|volume=7|issue=3|doi= 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00355.x |url=http://www.theiahe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Happiness-is-a-Stochastic-Phenomenon.-by-David-Lykken-and-Auke-Tellegen.-APS.-May-1996.pdf|first1=David|pages=186–189 |citeseerx=10.1.1.613.4004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence for this genetic predisposition derives from behavior-genetic studies that have found that positive and negative affectivity each have high [[heritability]] (40% and 55% respectively in one study).&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; Numerous twin studies confirm the notion of set point theory, however, they do not rule out the possibility that is it possible for individuals to experience long term changes in SWB.&lt;ref name="Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Matt |last=McGue |author2=Bacon, Steve |author3=Lykken, David|title=Personality stability and change in early adulthood: A behavioral genetic analysis|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1993|volume=29|issue=1|pages=96–109 |url =  http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/Personality_McGue01.pdf|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.29.1.96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diener et al. note that heritability studies are limited in that they describe long-term SWB in a sample of people in a modern [[western society]] but may not be applicable to more extreme environments that might influence SWB and do not provide absolute indicators of genetic effects. Additionally, heritability estimates are inconsistent across studies.

Further evidence for a genetically influenced predisposition to SWB comes from findings that personality has a large influence on long-term SWB. This has led to the ''dynamic equilibrium model'' of SWB. This model proposes that personality provides a baseline for emotional responses. External events may move people away from the baseline, sometimes dramatically, but these movements tend to be of limited duration, with most people returning to their baseline eventually.&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt;

===Bottom-up perspective===

From a bottom-up perspective, happiness represents an accumulation of happy experiences. Bottom-up influences include external events, and broad situational and demographic factors, including health and marital status. Bottom-up approaches are based on the idea that there are universal [[basic human needs]] and that happiness results from their fulfilment. In support of this view, there is evidence that daily pleasurable events are associated with increased positive affect, and daily unpleasant events or hassles are associated with increased negative affect.

However, research suggests that external events account for a much smaller proportion of the variance in self-reports of SWB than top-down factors, such as personality.&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; A theory proposed to explain the limited impact of external events on SWB is hedonic adaptation.&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt; Based originally on the concept of a "[[hedonic treadmill]]", this theory proposes that positive or negative external events temporarily increase or decrease feelings of SWB, but as time passes people tend to become habituated to their circumstances and have a tendency to return to a personal SWB "setpoint" or baseline level.

The hedonic treadmill theory originally proposed that most people return to a neutral level of SWB (i.e. neither happy nor unhappy) as they habituate to events. However, subsequent research has shown that for most people, the baseline level of SWB is at least mildly positive, as most people tend to report being at least somewhat happy in general and tend to experience positive mood when no adverse events are occurring. Additional refinements to this theory have shown that people do not adapt to all life events equally, as people tend to adapt rapidly to some events (e.g. imprisonment), slowly to others (e.g. the death of a loved one), and not at all to others (e.g. noise and sex).&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt;

==Factors affecting SWB==

===Personality and genetics===
A number of studies have found that SWB constructs are strongly associated with a range of personality traits, including those in the [[five factor model]].&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; Findings from numerous personality studies show that genetics account for 20-48% of the variance in Five-Factor Model and the variance in subjective well-being is also heritable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bouchard | first = Thomas J., Jr. |author2=Loehlin, J.C.  | year = 2001 | title = Genes, evolution, and personality | journal = Behavior Genetics | volume = 31 | pages = 243–273 | doi =  10.1023/A:1012294324713 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/qt0138g23w8720j1/ | issue = 3 | pmid = 11699599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[neuroticism]] predicts poorer subjective well-being whilst [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[conscientiousness]] and [[openness to experience]] tend to predict higher subjective well-being. A [[meta-analysis]] found that neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were significantly related to all facets of SWB examined (positive, negative, and overall affect; happiness; life satisfaction; and quality of life). Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of overall SWB and is the strongest predictor of negative affect.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;

A large number of personality traits are related to SWB constructs, although [[intelligence]] has negligible relationships.&lt;ref name=deneve&amp;cooper/&gt; Positive affect is most strongly predicted by extraversion, to a lesser extent agreeableness, and more weakly by openness to experience. Happiness was most strongly predicted by extraversion, and also strongly predicted by neuroticism, and to a lesser extent by the other three factors. Life satisfaction was significantly predicted by neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Quality of life was very strongly predicted by neuroticism, and also strongly predicted by extraversion and conscientiousness, and to a modest extent by agreeableness and openness to experience.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;   One study found that subjective well-being was genetically indistinct from personality traits, especially those that reflected emotional stability (low Neuroticism), and social and physical activity (high Extraversion), and constraint (high Conscientiousness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weiss | first = A. |author2=Bates, T. C. |author3=Luciano, M.  |year = 2008 | title = Happiness is a personal(ity) thing: The genetics of personality and well-being in a representative sample |journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 |pages = 205–210 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02068.x | pmid = 18315789 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeNeve (1999) argued that there are three trends in the relationship between personality and SWB. Firstly, SWB is closely tied to traits associated with emotional tendencies ([[neuroticism#Emotional stability|emotional stability]], positive affectivity, and tension). Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], affiliation) are important for subjective well-being. Happy people tend to have strong relationships and be good at fostering them. Thirdly, the way people think about and explain events is important for subjective well-being. Appraising events in an [[optimistic]] fashion, having a sense of control, and making active coping efforts facilitates subjective well-being. Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions about others. Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates subjective well-being.&lt;ref name=deneve1999/&gt;

The related trait of [[eudaimonia]] or [[psychological well-being]], is also heritable. Evidence from one study supports 5 independent genetic mechanisms underlying the Ryff facets of psychological well-being, leading to a genetic construct of eudaimonia in terms of general [[self-control]], and four subsidiary biological mechanisms enabling the psychological capabilities of purpose, agency, growth, and positive social relations&lt;ref name=Archontaki2012&gt;D.

===Social influences===
{{expand section|date=December 2012}}
A person's level of subjective well-being is determined by many different factors and social influences prove to be a strong one. Results from the famous [[Framingham Heart Study]] indicate that friends three [[degrees of separation]] away (that is, friends of friends of friends) can affect a person's happiness. From abstract: "A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25%."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fowler|first=J. H|author2=Christakis, N. A |title=Dynamic spread of happiness in a large social network: longitudinal analysis over 20 years in the Framingham Heart Study|journal=BMJ|date=4 December 2008|volume=337|issue=dec04 2|pages=a2338|doi=10.1136/bmj.a2338|pmid=19056788|pmc=2600606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wealth===
Research indicates that wealth is related to many positive outcomes in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Furnham &amp; Argyle|title=The psychology of money|year=1998|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such outcomes include: improved health and mental health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Langner &amp; Michael|title=Life stress and mental health: The Midtown Manhattan study|year=1963|publisher=Free Press of Glencoe  (New York)}}&lt;/ref&gt; greater longevity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|title=Unhealthy societies: the afflictions of inequality|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; lower rates of infant mortality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith |author2=Eikeseth |author3=Klevstrand |author4=Lovaas |title=Intensive behavioral treatment for preschoolers with severe mental retardation and pervasive developmental disorder|journal=American Journal on Mental Retardation|year=1997|volume=102|issue=3|pages=238–249|doi=10.1352/0895-8017(1997)102&lt;0238:IBTFPW&gt;2.0.CO;2|pmid=9394133|first1=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; experience fewer stressful life events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = RM | last2 = Runciman | first2 = WB | last3 = Gibberd | first3 = RW | last4 = Harrison | first4 = BT | last5 = Newby | first5 = L | last6 = Hamilton | first6 = JD.  | year = 1995 | title = The quality in Australian health care study | url = | journal = Med J Aust | volume = 163 | issue = | pages = 458–471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and less frequently the victims of violent crimes&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, J.

New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; However, research suggests that wealth has a smaller impact on SWB than people generally think, even though higher incomes do correlate substantially with life satisfaction reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aknin|author2=Norton, Dunn |title=From wealth to well-being? Money matters, but less than people think|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|year=2009|volume=4|issue=6|pages=523–527|doi=10.1080/17439760903271421|first1=Lara B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative influence of [[wealth]] together with other material components on overall subjective [[well-being]] of a person is being studied through new researches. The Well-being Project at Human Science Lab investigates how material [[well-being]] and [[perceptual]] well-being works as relative determinants in conditioning our [[mind]] for positive [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk| title=Understanding Positive Emotions |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study done by Aknin, Norton, &amp; Dunn (2009), researchers asked participants from across the income spectrum to report their own happiness and to predict the happiness of others and themselves at different income levels.  In study 1, predicted happiness ranged between 2.4-7.9 and actual happiness ranged between 5.2-7.7.  In study 2, predicted happiness ranged between 15-80 and actual happiness ranged between 50-80.  These findings show that people believe that money does more for happiness than it really does.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, M.I., Dunn, E.W., &amp; *Aknin, L.B. (2009). From wealth to well-being: Spending money on others promotes happiness. Invited talk at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Tampa, FL&lt;/ref&gt; However, some research indicates that while [[socioeconomic]] measures of status do not correspond to greater happiness, measures of [[sociometric status]] (status compared to people encountered face-to-face on a daily basis) do correlate to increased subjective well-being, above and beyond the effects of extroversion and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=C.|author2=Kraus, M. W. |author3=Galinsky, A. D. |author4= Keltner, D. |title=The Local-Ladder Effect: Social Status and Subjective Well-Being|journal=Psychological Science|date=31 May 2012|volume=23|issue=7|pages=764–771|doi=10.1177/0956797611434537 |pmid=22653798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Easterlin Paradox also suggests that there is no connection between a society's [[economic]] development and its average level of [[happiness]].   Through time, the Easterlin has looked at the relationship between [[happiness]] and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across countries and within countries.  There are three different phenomena to look at when examining the connection between money and Subjective well-being; rising GDP within a country, relative income within a country, and differences in GDP between countries.&lt;ref&gt;Easterlin,  Richard  A.,  1973,  Does  Money  Buy  Happiness?  The  Public  Interest,  30  (Winter),  3-10&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, when making comparisons between countries, a principle called the Diminishing Marginal Utility of Income (DMUI) stands strong.  Veenhoven (1991) said, "[W]e not only see a clear positive relationship [between happiness and GNP per capita], but also a curvilinear pattern; which suggest that wealth is subject to a law of diminishing happiness returns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Veenhoven | first1 = Ruut | year = 1991 | title = Is Happiness Relative? | url = http://repub.eur.nl/pub/16148| journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 1–34 | doi=10.1007/bf00292648| format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meaning a $1,000 increase in real income, becomes progressively smaller the higher the initial level of income, having less of an impact on subjective well-being. Easterlin (1995) proved that the DMUI is true when comparing countries, but not when looking at rising gross domestic product within countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Easterlin | first1 = Richard A. | year = 1995 | title = Will Raising the Incomes of All Increase the Happiness of All? | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 35–48 | doi=10.1016/0167-2681(95)00003-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
There are substantial positive associations between [[health]] and SWB so that people who rate their general health as "good" or "excellent" tend to experience better SWB compared to those who rate their health as "fair" or "poor". A meta-analysis found that self-ratings of general health were more strongly related to SWB than physician ratings of health.&lt;ref name=Okunmeta-analysis&gt;

A review of longitudinal studies found&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt; that measures of baseline subjective well-being constructs such as [[optimism]] and positive affect predicted longer-term health status and mortality. Conversely, a number of studies found that baseline [[depression (mood)|depression]] predicted poorer longer-term health status and mortality. Baseline health may well have a causal influence on subjective well-being so causality is difficult to establish.
A number of studies found that positive emotions and optimism had a beneficial impact on cardiovascular health and on immune functioning. Changes in mood are also known to be associated with changes in immune and cardiovascular response.
There is evidence that interventions that are successful in improving subjective well-being can have beneficial effects on aspects of health. For example, [[meditation]] and [[relaxation training]] have been found to increase positive affect and to reduce blood pressure. The effect of specific types of subjective well-being is not entirely clear. For example, how durable the effects of mood and emotions on health are  remains unclear. Whether some types of subjective well-being predict health independently of others is also unclear.&lt;ref name=Dienerhealth/&gt; Meditation has the power to increase happiness because it can improve self-confidence and reduces anxiety, which increases your well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Howard|title=The Pursuit of Happiness|year=1953|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultivating personal strengths and resources, like humour, social/animal company, and daily occupations, also appears to help people preserve acceptable levels of SWB despite the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.&lt;ref name="BosPrSWB" /&gt;

Research suggests that probing a patient's happiness is one of the most important things a doctor can do to predict that patient's health and longevity.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  In health-conscious modern societies, most people overlook the emotions as a vital component of one's health, while over focusing on diet and exercise. According to Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener, people who are happy become less sick than people who are unhappy. There are three types of health: morbidity, survival, and longevity.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  Evidence suggests that all three can be improved through happiness:

# Morbidity, simply put, is whether or not someone develops a serious illness, such as the flu or cancer.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  In a 30-year longitudinal study, participants who were high in positive emotions were found to have lower rates of many health problems. Some of these illnesses/problems include lower death rates from heart disease, suicide, accidents, homicides, mental illnesses, drug dependency, and liver disease related to alcoholism.  Additionally, results showed that depressed participants were more likely to have heart attacks and recurrences of heart attacks when compared to happy people.
# Survival is the term used for what happens to a person after he/she has already developed or contracted a serious illness.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  Although happiness has been shown to increase health, with survival, this may not be the case. Survival may be the only area of health that evidence suggests happiness may actually be sometimes detrimental. It is unclear why exactly research results suggest this is the case, however Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener offer an explanation. It is possible that happy people fail to report symptoms of the illness, which can ultimately lead to no treatment or inadequate treatment. Another possible reason may be that happy people tend to be optimistic, leading them to take their symptoms too lightly, seek treatment too late, and/or follow the doctor’s instructions half-heartedly. And lastly, Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener suggest that people with serious illnesses may be more likely to choose to live out the rest of their days without painful or invasive treatments.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;
# Longevity, the third area of health, is measured by an individual's age of death.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  Head researcher Deborah Danner of the University of Kentucky researched links between an individual's happiness and that individual's longevity. Danner recruited 180 Catholic nuns from a nearby convent as the participants of her study. She chose nuns because they live very similar lives. This eliminates many confounding variables that might be present in other samples, which can lead to inaccurate results. Such confounding variables could include drug use, alcohol abuse, diet, and sexual risk-taking. Since there are few differences among the nuns as far as the confounding variables, this sample offered the best option to match a controlled laboratory setting. Results showed that nuns who were considered{{by whom|date=September 2014}} happy or positive in their manner and language on average lived 10 years longer than the nuns who were considered unhappy or negative in their manner and language. A follow-up study by health researcher Sarah Pressman examined 96 famous psychologists to determine if similar results from the nun research would be seen as well. Pressman's results showed that the positive or happy psychologists lived, on average, 6 years longer. The psychologists who were considered{{by whom|date=September 2014}} negative or unhappy lived, on average, 5 years less.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;

===Physical characteristics===
A positive relationship has been found between the volume of gray matter in the right [[precuneus]] area of the brain, and the subject's subjective happiness score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep16891 | doi=10.1038/srep16891| pmid=26586449| pmc=4653620| title=The structural neural substrate of subjective happiness| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=5| pages=16891| year=2015| last1=Sato| first1=Wataru| last2=Kochiyama| first2=Takanori| last3=Uono| first3=Shota| last4=Kubota| first4=Yasutaka| last5=Sawada| first5=Reiko| last6=Yoshimura| first6=Sayaka| last7=Toichi| first7=Motomi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 6 week [[mindfulness]] based intervention was found to correlate with a significant gray matter increase within the precuneus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 4306280 | pmid=25632405 | doi=10.17140/NOJ-1-106 | volume=1 | issue=1 | title=Brain Gray Matter Changes Associated with Mindfulness Meditation in Older Adults: An Exploratory Pilot Study using Voxel-based Morphometry | year=2014 | journal=Neuro | pages=23–26 | last1 = Kurth | first1 = F | last2 = Luders | first2 = E | last3 = Wu | first3 = B | last4 = Black | first4 = DS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leisure===
There are a number of domains that are thought to contribute to subjective well-being. In a study by Hribernik and Mussap (2010), leisure satisfaction was found to predict unique variance in life satisfaction, supporting its inclusion as a distinct life domain contributing to subjective well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hribernik | first1 = J. | last2 = Mussap | first2 = A. J. | year = 2010 | title = Research note: Leisure satisfaction and subjective well-being | url = | journal = Annals of Leisure Research | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 701–708 | doi=10.1080/11745398.2010.9686871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, relationship status interacted with age group and gender on differences in leisure satisfaction. The relationship between leisure satisfaction and life satisfaction, however, was reduced when considering the impact of core affect (underlying mood state). This suggests that leisure satisfaction may primarily be influenced by an individual's subjective well-being level as represented by core affect. This has implications for possible limitations in the extent to which leisure satisfaction may be improved beyond pre-existing levels of well-being and mood in individuals.

===Cultural variations===

Although all cultures seem to value happiness, cultures vary in how they define happiness. There is also evidence that people in more individualistic cultures tend to rate themselves as higher in subjective well-being compared to people in more collectivistic cultures.&lt;ref name=science&gt;
{{cite book
|title=The Science of Subjective Well-Being|year=2008|publisher=Guildford Press

| editor=Michael Eid &amp; Randy J. Larsen

| chapter = Comparing subjective well-being across cultures and nations: the "what" and "why" questions}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western culture]]s, predictors of happiness include elements that support personal independence, a sense of personal agency, and self-expression. In [[Eastern culture]]s, predictors of happiness focus on an interdependent self that is inseparable from significant others. Compared to people in individualistic cultures, people in collectivistic cultures are more likely to base their judgments of life satisfaction on how significant others appraise their life than on the balance of inner emotions experienced as pleasant versus unpleasant. Pleasant emotional experiences have a stronger social component in East Asian cultures compared to Western ones. For example, people in Japan are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally engaging emotions (such as friendly feelings), whereas people in the United States are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally disengaging emotions (pride, for example).&lt;ref name=science/&gt; There are also cultural differences in motives and goals associated with happiness. For example, Asian Americans tend to experience greater happiness after achieving goals that are pleasing to or approved of by significant others compared to European Americans. There is also evidence that high self-esteem, a sense of personal control and a consistent sense of identity relate more strongly to SWB in Western cultures than they do in Eastern ones. However, this is not to say that these things are unimportant to SWB in Eastern cultures. Research has found that even within Eastern cultures, people with high self-esteem and a more consistent sense of identity are somewhat happier than those who are low in these characteristics. There is no evidence that low self-esteem and so on{{vague|date=September 2014}} are actually beneficial to SWB in any known culture.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

A large body of research evidence has confirmed that people in individualistic societies report higher levels of happiness than people in collectivistic ones and that socioeconomic factors alone are insufficient to explain this difference.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; In addition to political and economic differences, individualistic versus collectivistic nations reliably differ in a variety of psychological characteristics that are related to SWB, such as emotion norms and attitudes to the expression of individual needs. Collectivistic cultures are based around the belief that the individual exists for the benefit of the larger social unit, whereas more individualistic cultures assume the opposite. Collectivistic cultures emphasise maintaining social order and harmony and therefore expect members to suppress their personal desires when necessary in order to promote collective interests. Such cultures therefore consider self-regulation more important than self-expression or than individual rights. Individualistic cultures by contrast emphasise the inalienable value of each person and expect individuals to become self-directive and self-sufficient. Although people in collectivistic cultures may gain happiness from the social approval they receive from suppressing self-interest, research seems to suggest that self-expression produces a greater happiness "payoff" compared to seeking approval outside oneself.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

===Positive psychology===
[[Positive psychology]] is particularly concerned with the study of SWB.&lt;ref name=Diener2000&gt;{{cite journal|last= Diener|first=Ed| title= Subjective well-being: The Science of Happiness and a Proposal for a National Index|journal=American Psychologist|year=2000|volume=55|pages=34–43|url=http://mina.education.ucsb.edu/janeconoley/ed197/documents/Dienersubjectivewell-being.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.34|pmid= 11392863|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sonja"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyubomirsky|first=Sonja|title=Why are some happier than others?

P.|citeseerx=10.1.1.183.6660 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in positive psychology have pointed out that in almost every [[culture]] studied the pursuit of happiness is regarded as one of the most valued goals in life. Understanding [[individual differences psychology|individual differences]] in SWB is of key interest in positive psychology, particularly the issue of why some people are happier than others. Some people continue to be happy in the face of adversity whereas others are chronically unhappy at the best of times.&lt;ref name=BosPrSWB&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bos, E.H.|author2=Snippe, E.|author3=de Jonge, P.|author4=Jeronimus, B.F.| year = 2016 | title = Preserving Subjective Wellbeing in the Face of Psychopathology: Buffering Effects of Personal Strengths and Resources | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = e0150867| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | pmid=26963923|pmc=4786317}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Positive psychology has investigated how people might improve their level of SWB and maintain these improvements over the longer term, rather than returning to baseline.&lt;ref name="Sonja"/&gt; [[Sonja Lyubomirsky|Lyubomirsky]] (2001) argued that SWB is influenced by a combination of personality/genetics (studies have found that genetic influences usually account for 35-50% of the variance in happiness measures), external circumstances, and activities that affect SWB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Røysamb | first1 = E. | last2 = Harris | first2 = J. | last3 = Magnus | first3 = P. | last4 = Vittersø | first4 = J. | last5 = Tambs | first5 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Subjective well-being.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6819">'''Subjunctive possibility''' (also called '''[[Aletheia|alethic]] possibility''') is the form of modality most frequently studied in [[modal logic]]. Subjunctive possibilities are the sorts of possibilities we consider when we conceive of counterfactual situations; subjunctive modalities are modalities that bear on whether a statement ''might have been'' or ''could be'' true—such as ''might'', ''could'', ''must'', ''possibly'', ''necessarily'', ''contingently'', ''essentially'', ''accidentally'', and so on. Subjunctive possibilities include [[logical possibility]], metaphysical possibility, nomological possibility, and temporal possibility.

Subjunctive possibility is contrasted with (among other things) [[epistemic possibility]] (which deals with how the world ''may'' be, ''for all we know'') and [[Deontological ethics|deontic possibility]] (which deals with how the world ''ought'' to be). {{further|Counterfactual conditional}}

=== Epistemic possibility ===

The contrast with epistemic possibility is especially important to draw, since in ordinary language the same phrases ("it's possible," "it can't be", "it must be") are often used to express either sort of possibility. But they are not the same. We do not ''know'' whether [[Goldbach's conjecture]] is true or not (no-one has come up with a proof yet); so it is (epistemically) ''possible that'' it is true and it is (epistemically) ''possible that'' it is false. But if it ''is'', in fact, provably true (as it may be, for all we know), then it would have to be (subjunctively) ''necessarily'' true; what being provable ''means'' is that it would not be (logically) ''possible for'' it to be false. Similarly, it might not be at all (epistemically) ''possible that'' it is raining outside—we might ''know'' beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is not—but that would hardly mean that it is (subjunctively) ''impossible for'' it to rain outside. This point is also made by Norman Swartz and Raymond Bradley.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Swartz and Raymond Bradley, ''Possible Worlds — An Introduction to logic and its philosophy'', 1979, Hackett Publishing company, inc., {{ISBN|0-631-16130-9}}. Pp. 329-330&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deontic possibility ===

There is some overlap in language between subjunctive possibilities and deontic possibilities: for example, we sometimes use the statement "You can/cannot do that" to express (i) what it is or is not subjunctively possible for you to do, and we sometimes use it to express (ii) what it would or would not be right for you to do. The two are less likely to be confused in ordinary language than subjunctive and epistemic possibility as there are some important differences in the logic of subjunctive modalities and deontic modalities. In particular, subjunctive necessity entails truth: if people logically must such and such, then you can infer that they actually do it. But in this non-ideal world, a deontic ‘must’ does not carry the moral certitude that people morally must do such and such.

== Types of subjunctive possibility ==

There are several different types of subjunctive modality, which can be classified as broader or more narrow than one another depending on how restrictive the rules for what counts as "possible" are. Some of the most commonly discussed are:

* '''[[Logical possibility]]''' is usually considered the broadest sort of possibility; a proposition is said to be logically possible if there is no logical contradiction involved in its being true. "[[Dick Cheney]] is a bachelor" is logically possible, though in fact false; most philosophers have thought that statements like "If I flap my arms very hard, I will fly" are ''logically'' possible, although they are ''nomologically'' impossible. "[[Dick Cheney]] is a married bachelor," on the other hand, is ''logically impossible''; anyone who is a bachelor is ''therefore'' not married, so this proposition is logically self-contradictory (though the sentence isn't, because it is logically possible for  "bachelor" to mean "married man").
* '''Metaphysical possibility''' is either equivalent to logical possibility or narrower than it (what a philosopher thinks the relationship between the two is depends, in part, on the philosopher's view of [[logic]]). Some philosophers have held that ''discovered identities'' such as [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]]'s "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" are metaphysically necessary but not [[logical truth|logically necessary]] (they would claim that there is no formal contradiction involved in "Water is ''not'' H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" even though it turns out to be metaphysically impossible). In reality though, water also contains H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions.
* '''Nomological possibility''' is ''possibility under the actual laws of nature''. Most philosophers since [[David Hume]] have held that the laws of nature are ''metaphysically contingent''—that there could have been different natural laws than the ones that actually obtain. If so, then it would not be ''logically'' or ''metaphysically'' impossible, for example, for you to travel to [[Alpha Centauri]] in one day; it would just have to be the case that you could travel faster than the [[speed of light]]. But of course there is an important sense in which this is ''not'' possible; ''given'' that the laws of nature are what they are, there is no way that you could do it. (Some philosophers, such as [[Sydney Shoemaker]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}, have argued that the laws of nature are in fact ''necessary'', not contingent; if so, then nomological possibility is equivalent to metaphysical possibility.)
* '''Temporal possibility''' is ''possibility given the actual history of the world''. [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] ''could have'' chosen to take his degree in Accounting rather than Philosophy; but there is an important sense in which he ''cannot now''. The "could have" expresses the fact that there is no logical, metaphysical, or even nomological impossibility involved in Lewis's having a degree in Economics instead of Philosophy; the "cannot now" expresses the fact that that possibility is no longer open to becoming actual, given that the past is as it actually is.

Similarly David Lewis could have taken a degree in Economics but not in, say, Aviation (because it was not taught at Harvard) or Cognitive Neuroscience (because the so-called 'conceptual space' for such a major did not exist). There is some debate whether this final type of possibility in fact constitutes a type of possibility distinct from Temporal, and is sometimes called Historical Possibility by thinkers like [[Ian Hacking]].

==Awards and honours==
From 1993 until 1997, she received a Fulbright-MacArthur Scholarship to pursue her studies at Harvard.&lt;ref name="Pass"/&gt; In 2003, she won the University of Minnesota Award for International Distinguished Leadership for her work at the university.&lt;ref name="Pambazuka"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.international.umn.edu/awards/leader/2003/tamale.php| title=Distinguished Leadership Award for Internationals, 2003 Recipient, Dr. Sylvia Tamale, Uganda| date=11 January 2007| publisher=Office of International Programs, University of Minnesota| accessdate=18 October 2016| last=University of Minnesota| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513103458/http://www.international.umn.edu/awards/leader/2003/tamale.php| archivedate=13 May 2007| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, she was awarded the Akina Mama wa Afrika Award by [[Akina Mama wa Afrika]], an international, Pan-African, [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental development organisation]] for African women based in the United Kingdom with its African headquarters in Kampala, Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanrightshouse.org/noop/page.php?p=Articles/6431.html&amp;print=1&amp;d=1 | title=President accused of using culture to undermine women's rights | accessdate=18 October 2016 | date=6 March 2005 | publisher=Human Rights House Quoting  [[Inter Press Service]]| author=Evelyn Kiapi Matsamura}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, she was recognized by several women's organisations in Uganda, for her for human rights activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| accessdate=18 October 2016 | date=2 December 2004 | url=http://www.pambazuka.org/activism/honouring-sylvia-tamale | title=Honouring Sylvia Tamale - Outstanding contributor to the advancement of women's rights |author=Contributor |publisher=Pambazuka.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 2016, she became the first female lecturer to give a professorial inaugural lecture at Makerere University. Her lecture was entitled ''Nudity, Protests and the Law,'' inspired, in part, by the earlier-in-the-year nude protest of [[Stella Nyanzi]] at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=Makerere professor defends Dr Nyanzi nude protest |newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] |location=Kampala, Uganda | first=Blanshe | url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Makerere-professor-defends-Dr-Nyanzi-nude-protest/688334-3434278-13khqvq/index.html |date=30 October 2016 |accessdate=12 November 2017 | last=Musinguzi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her speech, Tamale called for a revision of the Ugandan laws that discriminate against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prof. Tamale gives inaugural lecture on nudity, protest and the law in Uganda  | date=31 October 2016| url=http://ugandajournalistsresourcecentre.com/prof-tamale-gives-inaugural-lecture-nudity-protests-law-uganda/  |accessdate=12 November 2017 |publisher=Uganda Journalists Resource Centre (UJRC) |author=UJRC |location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==
In March 2018, Makerere University selected Dr Tamale to chair a select committee to investigate "sexual harassment" at the public institution of higher learning. The report of the committee is expected in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=16 March 2018 | url=http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/Uganda-Makerere-University-investigate-sexual-harassment/2558-4344654-pss35s/index.html |title=Uganda's Makerere University to investigate sexual harassment |access-date=17 March 2018 | newspaper=[[The EastAfrican]] Quoting [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) |author=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has spoken out in support of the traditional practice of [[labia stretching]], arguing that any comparison to [[female genital mutilation]] is invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Akumu|first1=Patience|title=Labia elongation: Invaluable culture or dangerous practice?|url=http://www.observer.ug/lifestyle/73-people-society/8909-labia-elongation-invaluable|accessdate=24 April 2018|work=The Observer - Uganda|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides object types, the terminology model allows defining hierarchical classifications, definitions for object type and [[property]] behavior and definition of casual relations.

The terminology model is a means for subject matter experts to express their knowledge about the subject in subject specific terms. Since the terminology model is structured rather similar to an [[object-oriented]] database schema, is can be transformed without loss of information into an object-oriented [[database schema]]. Thus, the terminology model is a method for problem analysis on the one side and a mean of defining database schema on the other side.

Several terminology models have been developed and published in the field of statistics:

== Cause ==
Some academics argue that International Resource Privilege remains because arrangements between global institutions tend to be struck without adequate concern for their thoroughgoing effects on the global poor. One example is that it provides additional incentive to overthrowing governments, which in turn contributes to a cycle of political instability where a promising government might just as soon be toppled as a brutal military regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rasper|first1=Anke|title='Poverty is a massive crime against humanity'|url=http://www.dw.de/poverty-is-a-massive-crime-against-humanity/a-16936635|accessdate=1 March 2015|agency=Deutsche Welle|date=December 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schweickart|first1=David|title=Global Poverty: Alternative Perspectives on What We Should Do-and Why|journal=Journal of Social Philosophy|date=December 2008|volume=39|issue=4|pages=471–491|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9833.2008.00438.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little incentive for foreign governments to challenge the situation because they benefit from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKinnon|first1=edited by Catriona|title=Issues in political theory|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199572823|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Washington Post quotes [[Thomas Pogge]] as saying “most of us do not merely let people starve, but also participate in starving them.” &lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matthews|first1=Dylan|title=Americans already think a third of the budget goes to foreign aid.

Thomas Pogge argues that we are.

== Philosophical Response ==

[[Mathias Risse]] calls the resource and borrowing privilege "The Cosmopolitan Complaint". He does acknowledge that the global order provides incentives for it but attributes oppression to the sheer desire to rule. Risse rejects the  belief that the global order Pogge is referring to is shaped by the "sheer existence of states" but Pogge rejects this idea also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Risse|first1=Mathias|title=Do We Owe the Global Poor Assistance or Rectification?|journal=Ethics &amp; International Affairs|date=28 September 2012|volume=19|issue=01|pages=9–18|doi=10.1111/j.1747-7093.2005.tb00485.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=Severe Poverty as a Violation of Negative Duties|journal=Ethics &amp; International Affairs|date=28 September 2012|volume=19|issue=01|pages=55–83|doi=10.1111/j.1747-7093.2005.tb00490.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

''Thinking and Destiny'' by [[Harold W. Percival]] on "The law of thought". Its basic premise is that thinking creates karma or destiny. The book shows how to perfect our thinking and learn how to think without creating thoughts.

==Ideas==
The book is based on what Percival called “The law of thought.” It was produced over a period of 34 years and has 14 chapters, each with sections. Percival also provides succinct definitions of many words, from Accident and Alcoholism to Wrong, as they are used in his book. In ''Thinking and Destiny'' he offers a complete cosmology of the universe, with ideas such as the universe having nature and intelligent sides. Percival defines the nature side of the universe, in part, as an unintelligent mechanism through which units that are conscious only as their functions become self-conscious intelligences by means of what he termed “The Eternal Order of Progression.”

===The Law of Thought===
In ''Thinking and Destiny'', Percival explains how all of life’s lessons are the result of our own thinking and can be used to learn what to do and what not to do, and that we can perfect our thinking and learn how to think without creating thoughts. Thinking without creating thoughts is said to be the way to stop creating [[karma]] or destiny. Thinking is shown to be the cause and solution to reincarnation, otherwise known as the wheel of birth, life and death. Percival leaves it to the reader to choose what to do with the often startling information provided and assures that the lessons will be learned eventually.

===Conscious of Consciousness===
In his Foreword to the book, the author explained that his experiences of being “conscious of Consciousness” allowed him to focus the Conscious Light within on subjects to see their essence. He further stated that the book was dictated because it was difficult to do this kind of thinking and write at the same time. While the contents of ''Thinking and Destiny'' are from no other book or body of authority, he indicated that the authority for the truth in the book is in the reader who can judge the statements by the truth that is in him or her. To be able to think in this concentrated way and to be “conscious of Consciousness” are shown to be potentially within the grasp of all humans.

===The Great Way===
In a postscript to ''Thinking and Destiny'' it is stated that the most one person can do for another is to tell him or her that there is the Great Way, as shown in the book. The Great Way is how and where the human body is transformed into an immortal body. The author offers specific information for the few who really want it, and shows why each person must do the work in life, not after death. The individual will embrace the ideas or put them off, but death remains the cost of life until conscious immortality is attained. The truth is faced as a matter of honesty and courage.

===The Word Foundation===
In 1950 Harold W. Percival established [[The Word Foundation]], Inc., a non-profit organization, to keep ''Thinking and Destiny'' and all of his other works in print and to share with the people of the world what he called “the royal good news” about the doer said to be indwelling in every human body. Three of his other books expanded on themes from ''Thinking and Destiny''. They are: ''Man and Woman and Child, Democracy Is Self-Government, and Masonry and Its Symbols.''

==Editions==
''Thinking and Destiny'', by [[Harold W. Percival]], was originally published by The Word Publishing Company, New York in 1946 and is now in its fourteenth printing. Its subtitle is: “With a Brief Account of the Descent of Man into this Human World, and, How He Will Return to the Eternal Order of Progression.” To support the text, Percival included sections for Symbols, Illustrations and Charts and Definitions of Terms and Phrases as they are used in the book.

==Influence==
Percival’s works were noted as a major influence upon [[Richard Matheson]], the famous author and screenwriter. He said that his book The Path was based largely on ''Thinking and Destiny''.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson, Richard. The Path: Metaphysics for the 90’s. (1998) The Word Foundation, Inc. {{ISBN|091165013X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, ''The Bhagavad Gita: The Song of the Exalted Self'', 1999, by Owen Slight, the author states that [[Harold W. Percival]]’s ''Thinking and Destiny'', like the [[Bhagavad Gita]], reveals relevant, instructive and long lasting lessons regarding the higher self and the human plight—long lost lessons of everlasting truth contained both in the Sanskrit ''Bhagavad Gita'' and ''Thinking and Destiny''. Both books contain complete systems of knowledge. The plight of [[Arjuna]] is shown by Percival to be our own.&lt;ref&gt;Slight, Owen, The Bhagavad Gita: The Song of the Exalted Self, Owen Slight Publisher, 1999 {{ISBN|064635602X}}, 9780646356020&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="68134">On various occasions violence has been committed by unions or union members during labor disputes in the United States. When [[union violence]] has occurred, it has frequently been in the context of [[industrial unrest]].&lt;ref name="commission1969"&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed.

[[Anti-union violence]] has also occurred frequently in the context of industrial unrest, and has often involved the collusion of management and government authorities, private agencies, or citizens' groups in organising [[Strikebreaking|violence against unions and their members]].&lt;ref name="smith179"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first=Robert Michael|title=From blackjacks to briefcases: a history of commercialized strikebreaking in the United States|year=2003|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-8214-1466-8|pages=xvi-xvii, 179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4m963NRvPg|location=Athens OH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norwood"&gt;{{cite book |last=Norwood|first=Stephen Harlan|title=Strikebreaking &amp; intimidation: mercenaries and masculinity in twentieth-century America|year=2002|publisher=UNC Press|isbn=978-0-8078-5373-3|page=328|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJJOl7SMWIoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google79"&gt;{{cite book |title=Union organizing: campaigning for trade union recognition|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-26781-6|pages= 79–96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8E2E-NxvfcC|first=Gregor|last=Gall|chapter=Employer opposition to union recognition|editor=Gregor Gall|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ituc-csi1"&gt;{{cite web |title=2010 Annual survey of violations of trade union rights|url=http://survey.ituc-csi.org/+-Whole-World-+.html?lang=en|publisher=International Trade Union Confederation|accessdate=13 June 2010|author=ITUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mixer and server , Volume 12, Hotel and Restaurant Employee's International Alliance and Bartenders' International League of America., 1903, page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study in 1969, the United States has had the bloodiest and most violent labor history of any industrial nation in the world, and there have been few industries which have been immune.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; Researchers in industrial relations, criminology, and wider cultural studies have examined violence by workers or trade unions in the context of industrial disputes.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones (1979), Theories of American Labour Violence, Journal of American Studies, 13, pp 245-264, {{doi|10.1017/S0021875800011439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armand J.

==Overview==
According to a 1969 study, no major labor organization in American history has ever openly advocated violence as a policy, although some, in the  early part of the 20th century, systematically used violence, most notably the Western Federation of Miners, and the International Association of Bridge Structural Iron Workers.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; However, violence does occur in the context of industrial disputes. When violence has been committed by, or in the name of, the union, it has tended to be narrowly focused upon targets which are associated with the employer.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; Violence was greater in conflicts in which there was a question of whether union recognition would be extended.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;

Both employers and workers have each been the aggressor and victim at different times.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; The "most virulent" violence in United States industrial disputes occurred when management tried to destroy a union or deny recognition to a union.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;282&lt;/sup&gt;

Union violence most typically occurs in specific situations, and has more frequently been aimed at preventing [[Strikebreaker|replacement workers]] from taking jobs during a strike, than at managers or employers.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;

Protest and verbal abuse are routinely aimed against union members or replacement workers who cross picket lines ("blacklegs") during industrial disputes. The inherent aim of a union is to create a labor [[monopoly]] so as to balance the [[monopsony]] a large employer enjoys as a purchaser of labor. Strikebreakers threaten that goal and undermine the union's bargaining position, and occasionally this erupts into violent confrontation, with violence committed either by, or against, strikers.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; Some who have sought to explain such violence observe, if labor disputes are accompanied by violence, it may be because labor has no legal redress.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bernard Hogg, "Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question," Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171--199, citing John Bascom, "Civil Law and Social Progress," The Independent, vol. xliv (September 15, 1892), p. 1279.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, some workers declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;..."the right of employers to manage their own business to suit themselves," is fast coming to mean in effect nothing less than a right to manage the country to suit themselves.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bernard Hogg, "Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question," Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171--199, citing the advisory committee of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers during the Homestead Strike&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 1969 study of labor conflict violence in the United States examined the era following the 1947 passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, and concluded that violence had substantially abated. In the 16 years from 1947 through 1962, 29 people died in labor conflicts, a rate much lower than in previous eras. The study noted that attacks on strikers by company guards had all but disappeared. They estimated from NLRB records that 80 to 100 acts of violence by union members or supporters occurred each year, most of the attacks on people being unplanned fights with strikebreakers crossing picket lines. In the 1960s, the most common complaint of union violence was of sabotage during labor disputes. Numerous incidents included dynamite explosions, but targeting property, and without any dynamite-related injuries.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;

===Great Railroad Strike of 1877===
{{main|Great Railroad Strike of 1877}}

[[File:Harpers 8 11 1877 6th Regiment Fighting Baltimore.jpg|thumb|Sixth Regiment of the Maryland Militia fighting its way through [[Baltimore, Maryland]], 20 July 1877]]

The great railroad strike of 1877 saw considerable violence by, and against, workers, and occurred before unions were widespread. It started on July 14 in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]], in response to the cutting of wages for the second time in a year by the [[Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad]] (B&amp;O). Striking workers would not allow any of the stock to roll until this second wage cut was revoked. The governor sent in state militia units to restore train service, but the soldiers refused to use force against the strikers and the governor called for federal troops.

Violent street battles occurred in Maryland between the striking workers and the Maryland militia.  When the outnumbered troops of the 6th Regiment fired on an attacking crowd, they killed 10 and wounded 25.&lt;ref name="scharf"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scharf|first=J. Thomas|title=History of Maryland From the Earliest Period to the Present Day|publisher=Tradition Press|date=1967 |origyear=1879 |location = Hatboro, PA|volume=3|pages=733–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rioters injured several members of the militia, damaged engines and train cars, and burned portions of the train station.&lt;ref name="scharf"/&gt; On July 21–22, the President sent federal troops and Marines to [[Baltimore]] to restore order.

In Pittsburgh, strikers threw rocks at militiamen, who [[bayoneted]] their antagonists, killing twenty people and wounding twenty-nine others.

[[File:Harpers 8 11 1877 Steeple View of Pittsburgh Conflagaration.jpg|thumb|Burning of Pennsylvania Railroad and Union Depot, [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], 21–22 July 1877]]
In [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], workers conducted mass marches, blocked rail traffic, committed trainyard arson, and burned a bridge. The state militia shot sixteen citizens in the [[Reading Railroad Massacre]]. The militia responsible for the shootings was mobilized by Reading Railroad management, not by local public officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Zinn |first=Howard |authorlink= |title=A People's History of the United States 1492-present |publisher=Harper Collins | year=1995 |location=New York |page=248 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8V7J5qm5-YC&amp;dq=People's+History+of+the+United+States&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q= |doi= |accessdate= 2009-10-05 |isbn =978-0-06-052842-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago was paralyzed when angry mobs of unemployed citizens wreaked havoc in the rail yards. The strike was eventually suppressed by thousands of vigilantes, National Guard, and federal troops.

===Haymarket affair of 1886===
{{main|Haymarket affair}}

In 1886 the [[Haymarket affair]] (also known as the Haymarket massacre or Haymarket riot) was a protest rally and subsequent violence on May 4 at the Haymarket Square&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/S/SiteHaymarket.html|title=COC - Landmarks web - Home|work=cityofchicago.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506053947/http://www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/S/SiteHaymarket.html|archivedate=2009-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Chicago]]. The rally supported [[Strike action|striking]] workers. When [[Chicago Police Department|police]] began to disperse the public meeting, an unknown person threw a dynamite [[bomb]] into their midst. The bomb blast and ensuing [[Shooting|gunfire]] resulted in the deaths of eight police officers, mostly from [[friendly fire]], and an unknown number of civilians.&lt;ref name=degan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/3972-patrolman-mathias-j.-degan |title=Patrolman Mathias J. Degan |accessdate=2008-12-31 |publisher=The Officer Down Memorial Page, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the internationally publicized legal proceedings that followed, eight [[anarchism|anarchists]] were tried for murder. Four men were convicted and executed, and one committed [[suicide]] in prison, although the prosecution conceded none of the defendants had thrown the bomb.

The Haymarket affair is generally considered significant for the origin of international [[May Day]] observances for workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trachtenberg |first=Alexander |title=The History of May Day |origyear=1932 |url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/mayday/articles/tracht.html |accessdate=2008-01-19 |date=March 2002 |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive|Marxists.org]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foner |first=Philip S. |authorlink=Philip Foner |title=May Day: A Short History of the International Workers' Holiday, 1886-1986 |year=1986 |publisher=International Publishers |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7178-0624-9 |pages=27–39 |chapter=The First May Day and the Haymarket Affair}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes of the Haymarket Affair are still controversial, but can be traced in part to an incident the previous day, in which police fired into a crowd of agitated workers during shift change at the McCormick Works, where the regular work force was on strike, and at least two workers were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |page=190 |isbn=978-0-691-04711-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular literature, the Haymarket Affair inspired the caricature of "a bomb-throwing anarchist."

Illinois Governor [[John Peter Altgeld]] later pardoned the three living survivors of the Haymarket prosecution, concluding (as have subsequent scholars) that there had been a serious miscarriage of justice in their prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Laurence Danver, Revolts, protests, demonstrations, and rebellions in American history: an encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2010, page 575&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlotta R. Anderson, All-American anarchist: Joseph A. Labadie and the labor movement, Wayne State University Press, 1998, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burlington strike of 1888===
During [[Burlington Railroad Strike of 1888|the 1888 strike]] against the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]], workers were arrested for wrecking a train.  When one of those arrested turned out to be a detective, organized labor complained that the detective had incited the others.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bernard Hogg, "Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question," Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171--199, page 175, citing Journal of United Labor, July 12, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor unrest in 1892===
"In the 1890s violent outbreaks occurred in the North, South, and West, in small communities and metropolitan cities, testifying to the common attitudes of Americans in every part of the United States."&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; Workers with different ethnic origins who worked under very different conditions in widely separated parts of the United States nonetheless responded with equal ferocity when unions came under attack.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; "Serious violence erupted in several major strikes of the 1890s, the question of union recognition being a factor in all of them."&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;

1892 in particular was a year of considerable labor unrest. Governors of five states called out the national guard and/or the army to quell unrest—against miners in East [[Tennessee]] and in [[Coeur D'Alene, Idaho]], where a [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor strike of 1892|shooting war followed the discovery]] of a [[Labor spies|labor spy]], against switchmen in [[Buffalo, New York]], against a [[general strike]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], and against the [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]] steel strike.&lt;ref name="documentary23"&gt;Emma Goldman, Candace Falk, Emma Goldman, Vol. 1: A Documentary History of the American Years, Volume 1: Made for America, 1890-1901, University of Illinois Press, 2008, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor strike====
{{main|Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor strike of 1892}}

The strike of 1892 in [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]] erupted in violence when a union miner was killed by mine guards,&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; and was further inflamed when [[labor union|union]] miners discovered they had been infiltrated by a [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agent who had routinely provided union information to the mine owners.

On Sunday night, July 10, armed union miners gathered on the hills above the Frisco mine. More union miners were arriving from surrounding communities. At five in the morning, shots rang out, and the firing became continuous. Both sides blamed the other for starting the shooting. The union miners, exposed on the logged-off hillside, hadn't positioned themselves for a gunfight, while mine guards were able to shelter in buildings. The union men circled above the mill, and got into a position where they could send a box of [[black powder]] down the [[flume]] into one of the mine buildings. The building exploded, killing one company man and injuring several others. The union miners fired into a remaining structure where the guards had taken shelter. A second company man was killed, and sixty or so guards surrendered. Union men marched their prisoners to the union hall.

The violence caused the governor to declare Martial Law,&lt;ref name="Mark Wyman 1910, page 170"&gt;Mark Wyman, Hard Rock Epic, Western Miners and the Industrial Revolution, 1860-1910, 1979, page 170.&lt;/ref&gt; and bring in six companies of the [[Idaho National Guard]] to "suppress insurrection and violence." Federal troops also arrived, and they confined six hundred miners in [[Bullpen#Response to labor unrest .28United States.29|bullpens]] without any hearings or formal charges. Some were later "sent up" for violating injunctions, others for obstructing the United States mail.&lt;ref name="Labor's Greatest Conflicts 1908, page 13"&gt;Labor's Greatest Conflicts, Emma F. Langdon, 1908, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Homestead Strike, and an assassination attempt====
{{main|Homestead Strike}}

One of the most notorious incidents of violence against management occurred in 1892 during the [[Homestead Strike]]—one of the most violent industrial disputes in American history—when [[Alexander Berkman]] attempted to assassinate [[Henry Clay Frick]], chairman of the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] and manager of the mill where the strike occurred. Frick had locked out the workers, and later hired three hundred armed guards from the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton Detective Agency]] to break the union's [[picketing (protest)|picket lines]], resulting in gunfire and flaming barges on the Ohio River. There was a consensus of all parties that the presence of the Pinkertons inflamed the attitudes of the strikers.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; The strikers defeated the Pinkertons, but could not keep the mills from operating after the National Guard was deployed.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;

Berkman, an avowed [[anarchist]], had no connection to the union involved in the strike, but believed he was acting in the workers' interests. He was motivated by newspaper reports of,

&lt;blockquote&gt;...Henry Clay Frick, whose attitude toward labor is implacably hostile; his secret military preparations while designedly prolonging the peace negotiations with the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers|Amalgamated]]; the fortification of the Homestead steel-works; the erection of a high board fence, capped by barbed wire and provided with loopholes for sharpshooters; the hiring of an army of Pinkerton thugs; the attempt to smuggle them, in the dead of night, into Homestead; and, finally, the terrible carnage.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Berkman, Prison memoirs of an anarchist, Mother earth publishing association, 1912, pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Berkman's attack, called an [[Propaganda of the deed|attentat]] by the anarchists, injured but failed to kill Frick. Having anticipated that his act would launch a worker uprising, Berkman was surprised when a carpenter hit him with a hammer after he had been restrained. The attempted murder alienated the anarchist community from much of the labor movement, as well as dividing the anarchist community itself.&lt;ref name="documentary23"/&gt; Frick had been widely hated, but in at least one analysis, becoming the victim of such an attack transformed him into a "folk hero" in the public view.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;

During the Homestead strike, Carnegie Steel Company employees in Duquesne joined the strike that was occurring across the river. A riot broke out, and a number of the workers were arrested. It turned out that two of the strikers were Pinkerton detectives, and convictions were secured.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bernard Hogg, "Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question," Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171--199, citing Pittsburgh Commercial Gazette, July 24, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Virden, 1898===
In 1897, the Pana Coal Company attempted to import African-American strikebreakers. A train car was intercepted by armed striking miners, and the strikebreakers were sent home unharmed.

The following year, however, another company, the Chicago-Virden Coal Company, attempted a similar strike-breaking effort, this time with an armed escort on the train car. The result was called the [[Battle of Virden]].  Guards fired their rifles as they disembarked from the train. In the ensuing gun battle, fourteen men, including eight strikers, were killed.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; [[John Riley Tanner|Governor Tanner]] criticized the company, and called up the National Guard, who were able to restore order. The National Guard prevented a similar incident by turning away additional strikebreakers the day after the riot.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;

===Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor confrontation of 1899===
{{main|Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor confrontation of 1899}}

In April 1899, as the [[Western Federation of Miners]] (WFM) was launching an organizing drive of the few locations not yet unionized, superintendent Albert Burch declared that the company would rather "shut down and remain closed twenty years" than to recognize the union. He then fired seventeen workers that he believed to be union members and demanded that all other union men collect their back pay and quit.&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 111&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 250 angry union members belonging to the WFM seized a train in [[Burke, Idaho|Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;schwantes, carlos (1996). ""The Pacific Northwest: An Interpretive history"". University of Nebraska Press. p.320&lt;/ref&gt; At each stop through [[Burke-Canyon]], more miners climbed aboard. At Frisco, the train stopped to load eighty wooden boxes, each containing fifty pounds of dynamite. Nearly a thousand men&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 112.&lt;/ref&gt; rode the train to [[Wardner, Idaho|Wardner]], the site of a $250,000 mill of the [[Bunker Hill Mining Company|Bunker Hill mine]]. After carrying three thousand pounds of dynamite into the mill, they set their charges and scattered. Two men were killed,&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck—The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; one of them a non-union miner, the other a union man accidentally shot by other miners. Their mission accomplished, the miners once again boarded the "Dynamite Express" and left the scene.&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, pages 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;From Kellog to Wallace, ranchers and laboring people lined the tracks and, according to one eyewitness, "cheered the [union] men lustily as they passed."&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 114.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Once again, miners were rounded up and herded into [[bullpen]]s and held there for months.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Haywood, The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, page 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorado Labor Wars of 1903-04===
{{main|Colorado Labor Wars}}

During the [[Western Federation of Miners]] strike of 1903-04, there was considerable violence, including an explosion at the Vindicator mine which killed two, and an explosion at the Independence Depot which killed thirteen. The Cripple Creek Mining District was under occupation by the Colorado National Guard, the [[Citizens' Alliance]] was active in the district, and historians continue to debate who was responsible for each incident of violence.&lt;ref&gt;All That Glitters—Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Labor History of the Cripple Creek District, Benjamin McKie Rastall, 1905, pages 150,153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, George G. Suggs, Jr., 1972, pages 114,189&lt;/ref&gt; One likely perpetrator was convicted assassin [[Harry Orchard]]. A major in the National Guard later testified that the militia was responsible for orchestrated beatings of striking miners.&lt;ref name="freeland487"&gt;Louis Freeland Post, The Public, November 5, 1904, page 487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Durango Democrat, "Startling Exposure, Member of State Militia Makes Affidavit As To Cause Of Disturbances in Cripple Creek", October 29, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Association of Bridge Structural Iron Workers, 1906-1911===
Perhaps the most significant example of a campaign of union violence, the [[International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers|International Association of Bridge Structural Iron Workers]] employed dynamite attacks and assault from 1906 to 1911 over employers' demands for an [[open shop]]. After an initial peace offer, employers refused to talk to the union, and the union leadership adopted violent tactics as a direct response. Approximately one hundred structures were damaged or destroyed by dynamite, and about a hundred non-union workers were assaulted. In the Chicago area alone, there were 12 dynamite attacks on non-union construction sites from 1906 to 1911, six of them taking place in 1910. The attacks on construction sites were aimed at property, not people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwlocal1.com/history/TheDynamiteCampaign.html The dynamite campaign] Bridge, Structural &amp; Reinforcing Iron Workers Local Union #1, accessed 8 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide, nearly 100 dynamite bombs had exploded at non-union iron workers construction sites from 1906 to 1911.&lt;ref&gt;http://historicindianapolis.com/indianapolis-collected-the-great-dynamite-conspiracy/&lt;/ref&gt;

The most powerful foe of labor unions in Los Angeles was [[Harrison Gray Otis (publisher)|Harrison Gray Otis]], publisher of the [[Los Angeles Times]]. On 1 October 1910, [[Los Angeles Times bombing|a dynamite bomb exploded at the Los Angeles Times building]]. The explosion and subsequent fire killed 21 Times workers, and injured 100 more. Ortie McManigal, one of the Iron Workers Union members who participated in the bombing, confessed.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Martinez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RQG_AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=ironworkers+los+angeles+times+bombing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VTlmo7oqFR&amp;sig=qXnc72rgtU3t6ViKbKTrxDA-vMk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgoahUKEwiap7-swo3JAhXKMSYKHaZBDIY#v=onepage&amp;q=ironworkers%20los%20angeles%20times%20bombing&amp;f=false Terrorist Attacks on American Soil], (Rowman and Littlefield, 25 Oct. 2012) 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, a mysterious suitcase was found outside the home of Times publisher Otis; police moved the suitcase away from the building. When they opened it, they heard ticking, and ran. They were 60 feet away when the dynamite went off, creating a crater and rattling windows, but without injuring anyone. Another dynamite bomb was discovered and disarmed at the Los Angeles home of the president of the anti-union Merchants and Manufacturers Association.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Farrell, [http://www.jafarrell.com/clarencedarrowexcerpt.htmlexploded.http://www.jafarrell.com/clarencedarrowexcerpt.html Clarence  Darrow: Attorney for the Damned (excerpt)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern California crew of Ortie McManigal and James B. Macnamara were still not through, and set off eight more explosions, including a Christmas Day 1910 explosion at the Llewellyn Iron Works in Los Angeles.

Police found bomb-making equipment, including dynamite, at the Ironworkers Union office in San Francisco, and at the union headquarters in Indianapolis. Ortie McManigal confessed and testified against the others. James B. Macnamara pled guilty to placing the Los Angeles Times bomb, and his brother John J. Macnamara, secretary-treasurer of the union, pled guilty to planning the bombing of the Llewellyn Iron Works. In all, 40 members of the Iron Workers Union were convicted in the dynamite campaign, including union president Frank Ryan.

As of 2016, the Ironworkers Union website on the history of the union commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;McNamara, Ryan, Clancy, Butler, Morrin and the others may have done what they thought they had to do to preserve the International Association.  And despite other consequences of the dynamite campaign, they did save the Union.  The International Officers stretched the limits of zeal in a righteous cause.  Their strategy and tactics suffered - not the cause or validity of unionism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.ws/ironworkers373/iwhistory4b.html A History of the Ironworkers Union, Part 2], website of the International Association of Bridge, Structural,

===Battle of Blair Mountain, 1921===
{{main|Battle of Blair Mountain}}

Two years of conflict between miners and mine owners, characterized by utilization of the [[Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency]] for [[Labor spies|infiltrating, sabotaging]] and [[Union busting|attacking the United Mine Workers union]], culminated in the Battle of Blair Mountain in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;George D. Torok, A guide to historic coal towns of the Big Sandy River Valley, Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2004, page 119&lt;/ref&gt; The largest armed insurrection since the [[American Civil War]] was touched off by the murders of [[Sid Hatfield]] and Ed Chambers on the courthouse steps of [[Welch, West Virginia]].&lt;ref name="mountain149"&gt;Chuck Kinder, Last Mountain Dancer: Hard-Earned Lessons in Love, Loss, and Honky-Tonk, Da Capo Press, 2005, page 149&lt;/ref&gt; The Battle of Blair Mountain was a spontaneous uprising of ten thousand [[coal miner]]s from throughout West Virginia who fought the coal company's hired guns and their allies, the state police for three days before federal troops intervened.&lt;ref name="mountain149"/&gt;

===The Herrin Massacre, 1922===
{{main|Herrin massacre}}

Williamson County, Illinois, a county with a "unique history of violence" for a rural county, was the location of the Herrin Massacre, one of the most horrific and perplexing incidents of union violence.&lt;ref name="williamson10"&gt;Harry Spiller, Sheriff: a memoir of a lawman from Bloody Williamson County, Illinois, Turner Publishing Company, 1999, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; The 1922 incident is considered the most notorious of the United Mine Workers' struggles in Illinois.&lt;ref name="williamson10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stu Fliege, Tales and trails of Illinois, University of Illinois Press, 2002, page 180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chicagoreader1"&gt;James Ballowe, The Work of Our Fathers, http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-work-of-our-fathers/Content?oid=887838 retrieved April 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The massacre was committed by members (and possibly at the instruction of local leadership) of the United Mine Workers.&lt;ref name="chicagoreader1"/&gt; Three union men died in the exchange of gunfire during an afternoon-long armed siege of a non-union mine. The next day, the non-union miners surrendered and were disarmed in exchange for safe passage out of the county. However, union miners killed 20 men of the 50 strikebreakers and mine guards who surrendered. The ruthless retaliation occurred against the backdrop of broken promises, double dealing, and missed opportunities on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Illinois: A Descriptive and Historical Guide, US History Publishers, A.C. McClurg &amp; Company, Chicago, 1939, page 453&lt;/ref&gt;

== False flags and frameups ==
False flag operations are efforts to turn public opinion against an adversary, while pretending to be in the camp of that adversary. Historian [[J. Bernard Hogg]] observed of such operations as practiced in 1888:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A detective will join the ranks of the strikers and at once become an ardent champion of their cause. He is next found committing an aggravated assault upon some man or woman who has remained at work, thereby bringing down upon the heads of the officers and members of the assembly or union directly interested, the condemnation of all honest people, and aiding very materially to demoralize the organization and break their ranks.&lt;ref&gt;"Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question," J. Bernard Hogg, Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171--199, page 175, citing ''Journal of United Labor'', July 12, 1888. Hogg block-quotation contains a typo, interpretation is assumed as a single quote rendered as a comma.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some [[Labor spies|labor spy agencies]] advertised their false flag operations; for example, [[Corporations Auxiliary Company]], a labor spy agency which boasted 499 corporate clients in the early 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;John J. Abt, Michael Myerson, Advocate and activist: memoirs of an American communist lawyer, University of Illinois Press, 1993, page 63&lt;/ref&gt; told prospective clients,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In [the event other methods of sabotaging the union fail, our operative in the union] turns extremely radical. He asks for unreasonable things and keeps the union embroiled in trouble. If a strike comes, he will be the loudest man in the bunch, and will counsel violence and get somebody in trouble. The result will be that the union will be broken up.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Wellington Laidler, Boycotts and the labor struggle economic and legal aspects, John Lane company, 1913, pages 291-292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Deputy Prosecutor in Indiana's Johnson County, Carlos Lam, suggested in an email that Wisconsin's Governor Walker mount a "[[false flag]]" operation to make it appear that the union was committing violence in the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]]. After initially claiming that his email account was hacked, Lam admitted to sending the suggestion and resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Cassens Weiss, American Bar Association Journal, posted Mar 25, 2011, http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/a_second_indiana_prosecutor_is_out_of_a_job_for_unusual_advice_to_wisconsin/ retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CBS News, posted March 25, 2011, {{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412225147/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |archivedate=April 12, 2012 }} retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Walker's office disclaimed support for the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian |last=Montopoli |title=Indiana prosecutor resigns for encouraging fake attack on Wisconsin governor |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=March 25, 2011 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |accessdate=April 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412225147/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |archivedate=April 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Colorado Labor Wars]], the Colorado National Guard had been called into the [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] Mining District to put down a strike, and Colorado National Guard leadership became concerned that the [[Mine Owners Association]] had not lived up to their agreement to cover the payroll of the soldiers. In February 1904, General Reardon ordered Major Ellison to shoot up one of the mines. When such violence occurred, the blame would be placed upon the union.&lt;ref&gt;The Westerners brand book, 1963, page 430&lt;/ref&gt; In the dark of night, Major Ellison and Sergeant Gordon Walter fired sixty shots from their revolvers into the Vindicator and Lillie shaft house.&lt;ref name="freeland487"/&gt; The plan worked, and the mine owners paid up.&lt;ref name="freeland487"/&gt;

During the same strike, detectives were accused of attempting to frame union leaders for a plot to derail a train. A jury of non-union ranchers and timbermen unanimously acquitted three accused union men, and some testimony during the trial pointed at a plot by the detectives.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Carlson, Roughneck—The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983, pages 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William D.

[[Labor spies#Frameups|Frameups in labor disputes]] sometimes swung public opinion against the perpetrators. [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|During a 1912 strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts]], police acting on a tip discovered dynamite and blamed it on the union. National media echoed an anti-union message. Later the police revealed that the dynamite had been wrapped in a magazine addressed to the son of the former mayor. The man had received an unexplained payment from the largest of the employers. Exposed, the plot swung public sympathy to the union.&lt;ref&gt;

===1979 Imperial Valley Lettuce Strike===
The [[United Farm Workers]] 1979 strike against Imperial Valley lettuce growers was organized by Cesar Chavez to dispute wages for produce workers. Despite his outspoken calls for peaceful protests and the UFW's policy of non-violence, several instances of widespread violence and damage occurred during the strike. "UFW pickets engaged in rock-throwing, blocking access to and from grower facilities or fields, rushing into fields towards replacement workers, throwing nail-type devices on the ground to cause flat tires in grower vehicles, overturning grower vehicles, carrying or using sticks, clubs, sling shots or other weapons.....There was evidence that the picket captains urged strikers to throw rocks and to vandalize grower equipment. There was evidence that King and the picket captains made threats to kill the replacement workers. There was evidence that the UFW could discipline picketers who violated strike rules by pulling them off the picket line and having them work elsewhere yet the evidence tended to show the UFW rarely disciplined picketers....There was testimony picket captains encouraged strikers to throw rocks and vandalize grower equipment. In particular, there was evidence of a "Fantasma" or "Phantom Crew" organized by the strikers to intimidate growers and replacement workers. This phantom crew was composed of five or six "real strong young men" who would use a black van at night to attack replacement workers and to vandalize irrigation equipment, vehicles and homes belonging to growers and replacement workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/227/847.html,"] ''Justia'', 15 February 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, a judge would later find the actions of the UFW were "acts of unlawful picketing" and held them financially liable for damages to the growers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-14/local/me-5351_1_ufw,"] ''LA Times'', 14 May 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1985 Massey Energy strike===
The [[United Mine Workers Union]] 1985 strike against Massey Energy included attacks on company vehicles with rifle fire. Trucks hauling coal from the mines were fired upon with rifles a number of times, and three drivers had previously been wounded by the rifle fire before June 1985, when another truck convoy was hit by rifle fire, killing driver Hayes West when his truck was hit by at least 21 rifle rounds, and the driver of another truck was wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959201,00.html "Labor: war in the coalfields,"] ''Time'', 17 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

State and local law enforcement did not charge anyone in the death of Hayes West. Five members of the United Mine Workers Union, including Donnie Thornsbury, president of UMW Local 2496, were indicted by a federal grand jury, arrested, and charged with conspiracy to damage and disable motor vehicles used in interstate commerce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Five-Suspects-in-1985-Sniper-Slaying-Arrested/id-d35f2ff3ee9930c23af17c21ef64aafd "Five suspects in 1985 sniper slaying arrested"], Associated Press, 7 Aug. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; After a trial in federal court, four out of the five were convicted, including union official Thornsbury, and their convictions were upheld on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/972/349/177628/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1989-01-07/news/8901070449_1_thornsbury-sentences-convictions "Federal Appeals Court on Friday"], Orlando (Fla.)

Three union workers [[Dupont Plaza Hotel arson|set fire to the Hotel Dupont Plaza]] in San Juan, Puerto Rico, while other union members staged a fight as a distraction. The union, said to be affiliated with the Teamsters, was having a labor dispute with management over pay and health care. Ninety-seven people were killed, none of whom were union members. Most bodies were burned beyond recognition.

===1989 Pittston coal strike===
The 1989 strike by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) against the Pittston Coal Company's mines in Virginia and West Virginia was marked by shots fired at strikebreakers. In July 1989, a car bomb exploded in the parking lot of Pittston headquarters at [[Lebanon, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-14/business/fi-3977_1_car-bomb "Car Bomb, Gunfire Mark Coal Unrest"], Los Angeles Times, 14 July 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1993 Arch Mineral Corporation strike===
Eight members of the striking United Mine Workers Union were arrested after Eddie York was shot and killed in Logan County, West Virginia, as he drove away from the coal mine, through the picket line. York, an employee of an environmental contractor, was at the mine to perform government-mandated maintenance of sedimentation ponds, work unrelated to the labor dispute. In the same incident, a truck driven by a mine guard was struck by rocks thrown by strikers on the picket line, which smashed the windshield. Howard Green, a member of the UMW executive board, accused Arch Corporation mine guards of murdering York, to give bad publicity to the union.&lt;ref name="Randy Fitzgerald 1995, p.65-69"&gt;Randy Fitzgerald, "Murder in Logan County," ''Reader's Digest'', Feb. 1995, v.146 n.2 p.65-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Miami, during a 1997 Teamsters Union strike against UPS, a group of men pulled UPS truck driver Rod Carter out of his truck, beat him, and stabbed him six times with an ice pick. Carter had earlier received a threatening phone call from the home of Anthony Cannestro, Sr., president of Teamsters Local 769.&lt;ref name=LosAngelesTimes&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/apr/13/business/fi-50418 |title=Beaten UPS Driver Wins Teamsters Settlement - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1997-08-02 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nrtw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrtw.org/foundation-action/fa_15.htm |title=Foundation Attorneys Sock Teamsters with Racketeering Suit |publisher=NRTW |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter sued Teamsters local 769, charging that union officials had encouraged violent behavior by its members.

===Laborers Local 91, Niagara, New York, 1995-2001===
For years, officials of Laborers Local 91, in Niagara, New York, directed a strongarm squad&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niagarafallsreporter.com/editorial260.html Editorial:] ''Niagara Falls Reporter, 29 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; of union members to make death threats and to commit criminal acts against nonunion construction workers and work sites. In 1997, the union fire-bombed a residence used by non-union workers in Niagara Falls, New York, causing permanent injury to one of the inhabitants. In 1998, union members attacked four tile-layers at a supermarket construction site, beating them so badly that they were all hospitalized, one so badly that he had not returned to work four years later.

State and local law enforcement did not charge anyone in the beatings. After a four-year federal investigation, the FBI arrested 14 union members for the violence, including the local's vice president, business manager, assistant business manager, and a former president. Andrew Shomers confessed to the fire-bombing, and also to the beatings at the supermarket site. Another union member, confessed to driving the getaway car in the fire bombing.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Pfeiffer, [http://www.niagara-gazette.com/news/local_news/local-butler-sentencing-delayed/article_ed71e77c-8a6e-59c2-9d30-088ceca5044c.html "Local 91: Butler sentencing delayed,"] ''Niagara Gazette'', 15 Nov. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011, Longshoremen===
It was reported on September 9, 2011 that members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) frightened security guards, dumped grain, and vandalized property belonging to EGT, LLC, over a labor dispute. No one was hurt, and no one had been arrested at the time the incident was reported. District Judge Ronald Leighton later issued a preliminary injunction against the ILWU citing their reported behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/wash-police-longshore-protesters-storm-grain-terminal-at-port-of-longview-damage-rr-cars/2011/09/08/gIQAjGTICK_story.html Judge warns Wash. union to halt illegal tactics after 500 storm grain terminal, trap guards,] ''Associated Press'' September 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012, Lansing, Michigan===
Union workers protesting [[Right-to-work law|right-to-work legislation]] in [[Lansing, Michigan]] destroyed a tent run by [[Americans for Prosperity]]. People were inside the tent but managed to escape before the collapse. Additionally, hot dog stand operator Clinton Tarver, a popular vendor around the Capital area who was hired to provide catering for AFP, lost his equipment, condiments, coolers, and food in the collapse. According to Tarver (an African American), union workers, who had incorrectly assumed he was supporting AFP, called Tarver an "Uncle Tom nigger". A union worker also punched conservative comedian and Fox News contributor [[Steven Crowder]], resulting in a chipped tooth and a minor cut on the forehead. Another worker threatened to kill Crowder with a gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/blog/2012/12/11/VIDEO-Michigan-union-protesters-clash-with-Americans-for-Prosperity/2491355261225/|title=VIDEO: Michigan union protesters tear down Americans for Prosperity tent|work=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2012/12/lansing_business_owner_alleges.html|title=Lansing business owner alleges racial abuse, loses equipment in Right to Work protests at state Capitol|work=MLive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20121211/NEWS15/121211011/Michigan-Capitol-capacity-House-session-begins|title=3 arrested as anger grows among protesters; pepper spray used outside Capitol|work=Detroit Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/12/12/lansing-locals-raise-funds-for-hot-dog-guy-after-protesters-destroy-his-supplies/ | work=Fox News | title=Michigan locals raise funds for 'hot dog guy' after union protesters destroy his supplies | date=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asl_JkAY8gY&amp;feature=player_embedded|title=12-12-12 Clint Tarver on The Dana Show|date=12 December 2012|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nation.foxnews.com/steven-crowder/2012/12/11/union-thugs-attack-steven-crowder | title=NEW VIDEO ADDED: Union Thugs Attack Steven Crowder |date=December 11, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123105805/http://nation.foxnews.com/steven-crowder/2012/12/11/union-thugs-attack-steven-crowder |archivedate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ironworkers Local 401, Philadelphia, 2013===
Although the violence, property destruction and arson had been going on for years, it intensified after the economic downturn of 2008-2009, as construction work became scarcer. In 2012, Ironworkers union members caused $500,000 in damage to the non-union construction site of a Quaker meetinghouse in Chestnut Hill.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/us/philadelphia-vandalism-seen-by-some-as-union-intimidation.html?_r=1 "Philadelphia vandalism seen by some as union intimidation,"] ''New York Times'', 18 Jan. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In another incident, Ironworkers beat nonunion workers outside a Toys-R-Us store with baseball bats.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.philly.com/2015-07-17/news/64499119_1_ironworkers-local-401-union-ironworkers-nonunion-construction-sites }.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the violence was directed at union construction sites staffed by other craft unions, such as the Carpenters Union, in an attempt to get the work for the Ironworkers.

After an FBI investigation, federal prosecuters filed racketeering and arson charges against ten officers and members of Ironworkers Local 401.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/philadelphia/press-releases/2014/racketeering-and-arson-charges-filed-against-members-of-ironworkers-union Racketeering and arson charges filed against members of Ironworkers Union], Federal Bureau of Investigation, Press Release, 18 Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/philadelphia/press-releases/2014/additional-charges-filed-against-members-of-ironworkers-union Additional charges filed against members of Ironworkers], Federal Bureau of Investigation, Press Release.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the repeat perpetrators said that they called themselves "the helpful union guys" (THUGs)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/union-leader-convicted-in-philadelphia-racketeering-case/ "Union leader convicted in Philadelphia racketeering case,"] CBS News, July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Those who pled guilty testified that their crimes were at the direction of the Ironworkers Local's business manager, Joseph Dougherty. Dougherty was convicted in July 2015, and sentenced to 19 years in prison by a federal judge.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Roebuck, [http://articles.philly.com/2015-07-22/news/64687857_1_carpenters-union-nonunion-workers-union-leader "Ironnworkers' union boss, 73, sentenced to 19 years in prison,"] ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 22 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carpenters Union, Philadelphia, 2015===
In 2015, the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority sued the Carpenters Union local in Philadelphia for racketeering, under the federal RICO statute. The Authority charged that the union had engaged in a pattern of "illegal and disruptive mass picketing and protests; physical intimidation, harassment, stalking, and assault and battery; verbal intimidation, harassment, race-baiting, and threats; and the destruction of property." The Carpenters Union denied the charges.

==Union-on-union violence==
Sometimes, unions are accused of violence or threats of violence by other unions.

===Railroad Trainmen versus Street Railway Employees, 1940===
In June 1940, a bus driver member of the Amalgamated Association of Street Railway &amp; Motor Coach Employees, which was not on strike, was killed at the hands of members of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, which claimed to represent the bus drivers. The Railroad Trainmen blamed the bus driver, calling him a strikebreaker. The Street Railway &amp; Motor Coach Employees union later won an NLRB representation election, defeating the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.&lt;ref name=Taft-Ross&gt;{{cite book|title="American labor violence: its causes, character, and outcome," in Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr (eds.), Violence in America | first=Philip, and Philip Ross|last= Taft| publisher=Bantam|location =New York, USA|date= June 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;364

===United Mine Workers versus Progressive Mine Workers, 1941===
In 1932, some southern Illinois coal miners dissatisfied with the concessions made by the United Mine Workers Union, and what they regarded as the autocratic ways of its leader, [[John L. Lewis]], broke away and formed the Progressive Miners of America (PMA), later renamed the [[Progressive Mine Workers of America]]. The rival unions clashed violently from the start, resulting in numerous deaths on both sides, as well as police officers killed trying to prevent the violence.

The violence was especially intense in southern Illinois in 1932 and 1933, when PMA picketers tried to stop UMWA members from entering the mines. Officers and members of both unions were shot on the street and bombed in their homes. In addition, PMA members set off bombs to stop rail shipments of UMWA-mined coal, trying to force the companies to recognize the PMA. In 1937 the federal government charged 36 PMA members and officers with racketeering, in connection with 44 dynamite explosions at mines and rail facilities. The PMA maintained that the charges resulted from collusion between the FBI, UMWA, and Peabody Coal, and that their methods were no different from those of the UMWA. All 36 were convicted. Although the prison sentences were no more than 16 months, the fines and legal expenses had drained the PMA treasury, and the verdicts labelled the PMA as an outlaw organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sangamoncountyhistory.org/wp/?p=3316 Coal miner union war], Sangamon County History, 26 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Progressive Mine Workers union survived, and PMWA-UMWA violence flared up occasionally over the years, as one union would strike while the other continued to work, and they both claimed to represent miners at various coal mines. In 1946, two miners died in clashes between the rival unions at a mine at Benham, Kentucky, which was represented by the Progressive Mine Workers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19460507&amp;id=y98oAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JoUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5400,6051059&amp;hl=en "2 killed in Kentucky gun battle,"] Victoria (Tex.) ''Advocate'', 7 May 1946, p.1 c.5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the Progressive Mine Workers of America represented 4,500 coal miners, compared to the UMWA's membership of 160,000 The union dissolved in 1999.

== Legal status ==
In the United States, union violence often goes unpunished because of pro-union sympathies, or political pressure not to prosecute.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Roebuck, [http://articles.philly.com/2014-02-25/news/47639621_1_chestnut-hill-quaker-federal-authorities-meetinghouse Philly labor violence rarely punished], Philadelphia ''Inquirer'', 14 feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1966 study cited numerous examples of local and state police failing to interfere with, and state and local prosecutors failing to prosecute, union violence. The authors concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A public official sees many votes on the picket line; few in the office. Perhaps in 1932 it was true that local officials were ignorant of union objectives and brutal in the extreme toward peaceful picketers. Nothing could be further from the truth in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Frank H. Stewart and Robert J. Townsend, "Strike violence: the need for federal injunctions," University of Pennsylvania Law Review,  Feb. 1966, v.114 n.4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although replacement workers have the legal right to be free from violence or intimidation in labor disputes, many law enforcement officials will not interfere with union intimidation, for fear of being accused of being anti-union. When Democratic governor of Arizona Bruce Babbitt sent the national guard to prevent threatened violence by strikers in the Phelps Dodge copper strike of 1982, a union official charged that he was "in the pocket" of Phelps Dodge.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph M. Baily, [http://www.mininghistoryassociation.org/Journal/MHJ-v3-1996-Bailey.pdf “Keeping people from being killed”], Mining History Association Journal, 1996, v.3 p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal exceptions for labor unions===
The US Chamber of Commerce has pointed out that a number of states have made legal exceptions for labor disputes in their criminal laws. For example, California, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Illinois have exempted labor disputes from their laws against stalking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/documents/files/1208_StateLawReview_R2.pdf. Sabotage, stalking &amp; stealth exemptions: special state laws for labor unions], US Chamber of Commerce, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hobbs act makes extortion a federal crime, but under the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s 1973 Enmons decision ([[United States v. Enmons]]), the actions of union officials in organizing strikes and other united acts of workers are exempt from Hobbs Act prosecutions, as long as the labor dispute is over pay for work performed. This exemption does not confer any immunity from state prosecution for violent acts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-2403-hobbs-act-extortion-force-violence-or-fear Hobbs Act], US Department of Justice, accessed 12 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Union policies===
No American labor union currently has a policy of openly advocating violence, and some, such as the United Mine Workers in the Pittston Coal strike, have publicly emphasized peaceful means; the UMWA has striking members watch videos about the union's rules to assure peaceful picketing.&lt;ref name="Randy Fitzgerald 1995, p.65-69"/&gt; Labor unions have an incentive to keep strikes, and especially picket lines, peaceful, because if an activity organized and supervised by union officials such as picketing, becomes violent, the union itself may be found liable, in addition to the individuals.

===Public sympathies===
Some union sympathizers believe that labor union violence is justified, especially when directed at strikebreakers. Some hold that the law allowing and protecting strikebreakers is unfair, so that violence and intimidation are the only ways labor unionists can stage an effective strike.&lt;ref&gt;The crime of staging an effective strike.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waldo L. Cook, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HMNaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA337&amp;lpg=PA337&amp;dq=labor+union+violence+justification&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fEmqwNVHSj&amp;sig=7qnMiSQ8_QaOXi7XWsHpEcoqFCY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwA2oVChMIh6D4u8CDyQIVEOhjCh0SPA_t#v=onepage&amp;q=labor%20union%20violence%20justification&amp;f=false "Wars and labor wars,"] ''International Journal of Ethics'', 1907-1908.&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe that, although violence is wrong, it should be tolerated as an excess done for the greater good. [[Clarence Darrow]] voiced this view in his courtroom defense of labor leader [[Big Bill Haywood]], charged with ordering the assassination of the governor of Idaho:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't care how many wrongs they committed, I don't care how many crimes these weak, rough, rugged, unlettered men who often know no other power but the brute force of their strong right arm, who find themselves bound and confined and impaired whichever way they turn, who look up and worship the god of might as the only god that they know--I don't care how often they fail, how many brutalities they are guilty of. I know their cause is just.&lt;ref&gt;D. O. Linder, [http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/haywood/HAY_ACCT.HTM The trial of Big Bill Haywood], University of Missouri, Kansas City, School of Law, accessed 8 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Law enforcement sympathies===
Examples of local government inaction before or after union violence include the [[Herrin Massacre]], where the county sheriff was a member of the United Mine Workers, and did nothing to prevent or stop the killing of 21 nonstriking workers, after the strikebreakers had given up their weapons on a promise of safe passage out of the county.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyregister.com/article/20120622/NEWS/306229950 "Herrin Massacre still stands out 90 years later,"] Harrisburg (Penn.)

McClurg &amp; Company|location=Chicago|year=1939|page=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a nationwide Teamsters Union strike against UPS in 1987, the president of the Houston policeman's union faxed a message to all Houston police stations, urging them to stop UPS drivers, and "go into zero tolerance mode, to get the nonstriking drivers off the street.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/08/us/a-union-is-criticized-for-a-message-of-solidarity.html "A union is criticized for a Message of solidarity"], ''New York Times''. 8 August 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political support===
On 12 October 1898, at Virden, Illinois, a crowd of strikers armed with rifles tried to prevent a railroad car of strikebreakers from disembarking, and 8 strikers and 6 strikebreakers died in the gunfight. governor Tanner of Illinois ordered in the National Guard, and on his orders, the following day the Guard prevented the companies from bringing in more strikebreakers. Unable to continue operating, the companies gave in.&lt;ref&gt;Violence in America, p.301-302.&lt;/ref&gt; The governor admitted that he had no legal authority for his action in preventing the arrival of strikebreakers, but said that he was doing the will of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Paul D. Moreno, [https://books.google.com/books?id=URDl2NuzZzAC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=virden+illinois+strike+legality+governor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sAchO2a7Uh&amp;sig=e2zVazYroLVBhXrzc67V-oN3r78&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7lJjhnI3MAhUC5GMKHZTtBYo4ChDoAQhHMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=virden%20illinois%20strike%20legality%20governor&amp;f=false Blacks and Organized Labor: a New History], (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 2008) 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employer reluctance to press charges===
When local, state, or federal officials try to prosecute union violence, they sometimes find that employers are reluctant to cooperate, for fear of union repraisal.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Oreskes, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/27/nyregion/construction-corruption-inquiry-hampered-fears-retaliation-tainted-industry.html?pagewanted=all "Construction corruption inquiry hampered by fears of retaliation in tainted industry,"] ''New York Times'', 27 April 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Valence (disambiguation)}}

'''Valence''', as used in psychology, especially in discussing [[emotion]]s, means the intrinsic [[pleasure|attractiveness]]/"good"-ness (positive valence) or [[suffering|averseness]]/"bad"-ness (negative valence) of an event, object, or situation.&lt;ref&gt;Nico H. Frijda, The Emotions. Cambridge(UK): Cambridge University Press, 1986. p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; The term also characterizes and categorizes specific emotions. For example, emotions popularly referred to as "negative", such as [[anger]] and [[fear]], have ''negative valence''. [[Joy]] has ''positive valence''. Positively valenced emotions are evoked by positively valenced events, objects, or situations. The term is also used to describe the '''hedonic tone''' of [[feeling]]s, [[affect (psychology)|affect]], certain [[behavior]]s (for example, approach and avoidance), goal attainment or nonattainment, and conformity with or violation of [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]. [[Ambivalence]] can be viewed as conflict between positive and negative valence-carriers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Theorists taking a valence-based approach to studying affect, judgment, and choice posit that emotions with the same valence (e.g., anger and fear or [[pride]] and [[Surprise_(emotion)|surprise]]) produce a similar influence on judgments and choices.
Stress is negative valence and opposite of this is pleasure or happiness. Stress can mean all unpleasant emotions.

==History of usage==
The term entered English in psychology with the translation from German ("Valenz") in 1935 of works of [[Kurt Lewin]]. Ambivalence has a longer history.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Criterion for emotion==
Valence is one criterion used in some definitions of emotion. The possible absence of valence is cited as a reason to exclude [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]] from the list of emotions, though some would include it.

==Measurement==
Valence could be assigned a number and treated as if it were measured, but the validity of a [[measurement]] based on a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] report is questionable. Measurement based on observations of facial expressions, using the [[Facial Action Coding System]] and [[microexpressions]] (see [[Paul Ekman]]) or muscle activity detected through [[facial electromyography]], or on modern functional [[brain imaging]] may overcome this objection. Emotional valence is represented in right posterior superior temporal sulcus and medial prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kliemann|first=Dorit|last2=Jacoby|first2=Nir|last3=Anzellotti|first3=Stefano|last4=Saxe|first4=Rebecca R.|date=2016-11-16|title=Decoding task and stimulus representations in face-responsive cortex|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02643294.2016.1256873|journal=[[Cognitive Neuropsychology (journal)|Cognitive Neuropsychology]] |volume=33|issue=7–8|pages=362–377|doi=10.1080/02643294.2016.1256873|issn=0264-3294|pmid=27978778|pmc=5673491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vertical farming''' is the practice of producing food and medicine in vertically stacked layers, vertically inclined surfaces and/or integrated in other structures (such as in a skyscraper, used warehouse, or shipping container). The modern ideas of vertical farming use indoor farming techniques and [[controlled-environment agriculture]] (CEA) technology, where all environmental factors can be controlled. These facilities utilize artificial control of light, environmental control (humidity, temperature, gases...) and [[fertigation]]. Some vertical farms use techniques similar to [[greenhouse]]s, where natural [[sunlight]] can be augmented with artificial [[lighting]] and [[metal]] [[Mirror|reflectors]].&lt;ref name="Hix, John 1974"&gt;Hix, John. 1974.

Hydroponic systems can be lit by LEDs that mimic sunlight. Software can ensure that all the plants get the same amount of light, water and nutrients. Proper managements means that no herbicides or pesticides are required.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129524-100-vertical-farms-sprouting-all-over-the-world/|title=Vertical farms sprouting all over the world|last=Marks|first=Paul|date=15 January 2014|work=New Scientist|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The term "vertical farming" was coined by Gilbert Ellis Bailey in 1915 in his book ''Vertical Farming''. His use of the term differs from the current meaning—he wrote about [[farming]] with a special interest in soil origin, its nutrient content and the view of plant life as "vertical" life forms, specifically relating to their underground root structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924000349328 |title=Vertical farming (1915) |publisher=E. I. duPont de Nemours Powder Co. |location=Wilmington, Del.  |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern usage of the term "vertical farming" usually refers to growing plants in layers, whether in a multistory skyscraper, used warehouse, or shipping container.

===Mixed-use skyscrapers===
Mixed-use skyscrapers were proposed and built by architect [[Ken Yeang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.architecture.org.au/news/enews/354-ken-yeang-and-bioclimatic-architecture|title=Ken Yeang and Bioclimatic Architecture|website=www.architecture.org.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeang proposes that instead of hermetically sealed mass-produced agriculture, plant life should be cultivated within open air, mixed-use skyscrapers for climate control and consumption. This version of vertical farming is based upon personal or community use rather than the wholesale production and distribution that aspires to feed an entire city.

===Despommier's skyscrapers===
Ecologist [[Dickson Despommier]] argues that vertical farming is legitimate for environmental reasons. He claims that the cultivation of plant life within skyscrapers will require less [[embodied energy]] and produce less pollution than some methods of producing plant life on natural landscapes. He moreover claims that natural landscapes are too toxic for natural agricultural production, despite the ecological and environmental costs of extracting materials to build skyscrapers for the simple purpose of agricultural production.{{citation needed|reason=the 2nd part of the sentence sounds like a reader's inserted opinion, not Despommier's|date=February 2016}}

Despommier's concept of the vertical farm emerged in 1999 at [[Columbia University]]. It promotes the mass cultivation of plant life for commercial purposes in skyscrapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/science/15farm.html |title=Country, the City Version: Farms in the Sky Gain New Interest  |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date= 2008-07-15|accessdate=2011-01-05 |first=Bina |last=Venkataraman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stackable shipping containers===
Several companies have developed stacking recycled [[Intermodal_container|shipping containers]] in urban settings. Brighterside Consulting created a complete off-grid container system. [[Freight Farms]] produces a "leafy green machine" that is a complete [[farm-to-table]] system outfitted with vertical hydroponics, [[LED]] lighting and intuitive climate controls built within a 12&amp;nbsp;m &amp;times; 2.4&amp;nbsp;m shipping container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t-PUIXUPgw|title=2015 Leafy Green Machine by Freight Farms|first=|last=Freight Farms|date=12 April 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Podponics built a vertical farm in Atlanta consisting of over 100 stacked "growpods".&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=zWommg6JVfY|title=PodPonics Info Video 3d Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar farm is under construction in Oman.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=r-Iymp-gdbo|title=PodPonics Oman Video Blog Part 1|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=PrLTuGKcvPA|title=Oman Video Blog Part 2: Ramadan}}&lt;/ref&gt; TerraFarms offer a proprietary&lt;ref name="localrootsfarms-how-we-farm-tech"&gt;{{cite web

Controlling light governs the growth cycle of the plant. E.g., infrared LEDs can mimic 5 minutes of sunset, stimulating some plants to begin flowering.&lt;ref name="arstechnica-science-2017-12-local-roots-farm-in-a-box"/&gt;

==Technology==
Lighting can be natural or via LEDs. As of 2018 commercial LEDs were about 28 per cent efficient, which keeps the cost of produce high and prevents vertical farms from competing in regions where cheap vegetables are abundant. However, lighting engineers at [[Philips]] have demonstrated LEDs with 68 per cent efficiency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Energy costs can be reduced because full-spectrum white light is not required. Instead, red and blue or purple light can be generated with less electricity.

==History==
One of the earliest drawings of a tall building that cultivates food was published in ''[[Life Magazine]]'' in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[https://store.ctbuh.org/PDF_Previews/Journal/CTBUHJournal_2009-2.pdf Nakheel Harbor and Tower] &lt;/ref&gt; The reproduced drawings feature vertically stacked homesteads set amidst a farming landscape. This proposal can be seen in [[Rem Koolhaas]]'s ''Delirious New York''.  Koolhaas wrote that this 1909 theorem is 'The Skyscraper as Utopian device for the production of unlimited numbers of virgin sites on a metropolitan location'.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas2014"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=163oAwAAQBAJ}}|title=Delirious New York: A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan|last=Koolhaas|first=Rem|date=1 July 2014|publisher=Monacelli Press|isbn=978-1-58093-410-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydroponicum ===
Early architectural proposals that contributge to VF include [[Le Corbusier]]'s Immeubles-Villas (1922) and SITE's Highrise of Homes (1972).&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruby|first1=Ilka|last2=Ruby|first2=Andreas|title=Groundscapes: el reencuentro con el suelo en la arquitectura contemporánea|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=mglNAAAAYAAJ}}|year=2006|publisher=G.

Images of the vertical farms at the School of Gardeners in Langenlois, Austria, and the glass tower at the Vienna International Horticulture Exhibition (1964) show that vertical farms existed.&lt;ref name="Hix, John 1974" /&gt; The technological precedents that make vertical farming possible can be traced back to horticultural history through the development of [[greenhouse]] and [[Hydroponics|hydroponic]] technology. Early [[Hydroponicum|hydroponicums]] integrated hydroponic technology into building systems. These [[horticultural building system]]s evolved from greenhouse technology.  The British Interplanetary Society developed a [[hydroponicum]] for lunar conditions, while other building prototypes were developed during the early days of space exploration. The first Tower Hydroponic Units were developed in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Hydroponics problems|url=http://academy.academy-info.com/index.php?LMID=National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20Armenia&amp;ID=11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811024138/http://academy.academy-info.com/index.php?LMID=National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20Armenia&amp;ID=11 |archivedate=August 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armenian tower hydroponicums are the first built examples of a vertical farm, and are documented in Sholto Douglas' ''[[Hydroponics]]: The Bengal System,'' first published in 1951 with data from the then-[[East Pakistan]], today's [[Bangladesh]], and the [[India]]n state of [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps-survival.com/PS/Hydroponics/Hydroponics_The_Bengal_System_1959.pdf|title=link|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ps-survival.com/PS/Hydroponics/Hydroponics_The_Bengal_System_1959.pdf Hydroponics The Bengal System]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sholto Douglas 1975"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=obVOSgAACAAJ}}|title=Hydroponics: The Bengal System|last1=Douglas|first1=James Sholto|date=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195605662|edition=5th|location=New Dehli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later precursors that have been published, or built, are Ken Yeang's Bioclimatic Skyscraper (Menara Mesiniaga, built 1992); MVRDV's PigCity, 2000; MVRDV's Meta City/ Datatown (1998–2000); Pich-Aguilera's Garden Towers (2001).&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;

Ken Yeang is perhaps the most widely known architect who has promoted the idea of the 'mixed-use' Bioclimatic Skyscraper which combines living units and food production.

=== Vertical farm ===
[[Dickson Despommier]] is a professor of [[environmental health]] sciences and [[microbiology]]. He reopened the topic of VF in 1999 with graduate students in a medical ecology class. He speculated that a 30-floor farm on one city block could provide food for 50,000 people including vegetables, fruit, eggs and meat, explaining that hydroponic crops could be grown on upper floors; while the lower floors would be suited for chickens and fish that eat plant waste.

Although many of Despommier's suggestions have been challenged from an environmental science and engineering point of view, Despommier successfully popularized his assertion that food production can be transformed. Critics claimed that the additional energy needed for artificial lighting, heating and other operations would outweigh the benefit of the building's close proximity to the areas of consumption.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21154137/|title=Could vertical farming be the future? Nelson, B. (2008).|last=Nelson|first=Bryn|date=2007-12-12|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/16/green-ivory-towers-farm-skyscrapers|title=Monbiot, G.

Despommier originally challenged his class to feed the entire population of [[Manhattan]] (about 2,000,000 people) using only {{convert|13|acre|ha|order=flip|0}} of [[rooftop gardens]]. The class calculated that rooftop gardening methods could feed only two percent of the population. Unsatisfied with the results, Despommier made an off-the-cuff suggestion of growing plants indoors, vertically. By 2001 the first outline of a vertical farm was introduced. In an interview Despommier described how vertical farms would function:

{{quote|Each floor will have its own watering and nutrient monitoring systems. There will be sensors for every single plant that tracks how much and what kinds of nutrients the plant has absorbed. You'll even have systems to monitor plant diseases by employing DNA chip technologies that detect the presence of plant pathogens by simply sampling the air and using snippets from various viral and bacterial infections. It's very easy to do.

Moreover, a gas [[chromatograph]] will tell us when to pick the plant by analyzing which [[Flavonoid|flavenoids]] the produce contains. These flavonoids are what gives the food the flavors you're so fond of, particularly for more aromatic produce like tomatoes and peppers. These are all right-off-the-shelf technologies. The ability to construct a vertical farm exists now. We don't have to make anything new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Arnie Cooper |date=May 19, 2009 |url=http://www.miller-mccune.com/science_environment/farming-in-high-rises-raises-hopes-1226 |title=Going up?

In 2011 the Plant in [[Chicago]] was building an [[anaerobic digestion#Power generation|anaerobic digester]] into the building. This will allow the farm to operate off the energy grid. Moreover, the anaerobic digester will be recycling waste from nearby businesses that would otherwise go into landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantchicago.com/about-the-plant/|title=About The Plant|publisher=The Plant|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204102733/http://www.plantchicago.com/about-the-plant/|archivedate=2011-12-04|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Association for Vertical Farming]] was founded in [[Munich]], Germany.

As of 2014, Vertical Fresh Farms was operating in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, specializing in [[salad greens]], [[herb]]s and sprouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vertical Fresh Farms LLC, Buffalo, NY {{!}} StateLog|url = http://www.statelog.com/vertical-fresh-farms-llc-buffalo-ny|website = www.statelog.com|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March the world’s then largest vertical farm opened in Scranton, Pennsylvania, built by Green Spirit Farms (GSF). The firm is housed in a single story building covering 3.25 hectares, with racks stacked six high to house 17 million plants. The farm was to grow 14 lettuce crops per year, as well as spinach, kale, tomatoes, peppers, basil and strawberries. Water is scavenged from the farm's atmosphere with a [[dehumidifier]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2015 study utilized inexpensive [[metal]] [[Mirror|reflectors]] to supply sunlight to the plants, reducing energy costs.&lt;ref name="bowenpublishing.com" /&gt;

Kyoto-based Nuvege (pronounced “new veggie”) operates a windowless farm. Its LED lighting is tuned to service two types of chlorophyll, one preferring red light and the other blue. Nuvege produces 6 million lettuce heads a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Problems==

===Economics===
Opponents question the potential profitability of vertical farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clive Clifton says: |url=http://e4capital.com/2009/08/24/vertical-farming/ |title=Vertical Farming: Too Far Outside the Box? &amp;#124; |publisher=E4capital.com |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its economic and environmental benefits rest partly on the concept of minimizing [[food miles]], the distance that food travels from farm to consumer.{{original research inline|date=September 2011}} However, a recent analysis suggests that transportation is only a minor contributor to the economic and environmental costs of supplying food to urban populations. The analysis concluded that "food miles are, at best, a marketing fad."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, P. (July 22, 2009). Local food no green panacea: professor. CBC News http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2009/07/22/consumer-local-food.html&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the facility would have to lower costs or charge higher prices to justify remaining in a city.

Similarly, if power needs are met by fossil fuels, the environmental effect may be a net loss;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/17647627?story_id=17647627&amp;fsrc=rss | work=The Economist | title=Does it really stack up? | date=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; even building low-carbon capacity to power the farms may not make as much sense as simply leaving traditional farms in place, while burning less coal.

The initial building costs would exceed $100 million, for a 60 hectare vertical farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/greenbus.htm |title=Starting a Commercial Greenhouse Business |publisher=Omafra.gov.on.ca |date=2003-07-28 |accessdate=2010-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024230113/http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/greenbus.htm |archivedate=2005-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Office [[occupancy cost]]s can be high in major cities, with office space in cities such as [[Tokyo]], [[Moscow]], [[Mumbai]], [[Dubai]], [[Milan]], [[Zurich]], and [[Sao Paulo]] ranging from $1850 to $880 per square meter.&lt;ref&gt;Pocket World in Figures, [[The Economist]], 2011 ed. pg 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy use===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:B11architecture exteriors040.jpg|thumb|A [[greenhouse]] with its lights on at night, contributing to ''[[light pollution]]'']] --&gt;

During the growing season, the sun shines on a vertical surface at an extreme angle such that much less light is available to crops than when they are planted on flat land. Therefore, supplemental light would be required. Bruce Bugbee claimed that the power demands of vertical farming would be uncompetitive with traditional farms using only natural light.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roach |first=J. |date=June 30, 2009 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090630-farm-towers-locally-grown.html |title=High-Rise Farms: The Future of Food?|publisher=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental writer [[George Monbiot]] calculated that the cost of providing enough supplementary light to grow the grain for a single loaf would be about $15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2010/08/16/towering-lunacy/ |title=George Monbiot – Towering Lunacy |publisher=Monbiot.com |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the Economist argued that "even though crops growing in a glass skyscraper will get some natural sunlight during the day, it won't be enough" and "the cost of powering artificial lights will make indoor farming prohibitively expensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Economist |date=December 9, 2010 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17647627 |title=Vertical farming: Does it really stack up?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As "The Vertical Farm" proposes a controlled environment, heating and cooling costs will resemble those of any other tower. Plumbing and elevator systems are necessary to distribute nutrients and water. In the northern continental United States, fossil fuel heating cost can be over $200,000 per hectare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/crops/greenhouse/bng01s01.html |title=Crops &amp;#124; Greenhouse &amp;#124; Greenhouse Energy Calculations &amp;#124; Manitoba Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives &amp;#124; Province of Manitoba |publisher=Gov.mb.ca |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution===
Depending on the method of electricity generation used, greenhouse [[produce]] can create more greenhouse gases than field produce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcafood.dk/Material/How%20to%20prepare.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719125741/http://www.lcafood.dk/Material/How%20to%20prepare.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; largely due to higher energy use per kilogram. Vertical farms require much greater energy per kilogram versus regular greenhouses, mainly through increased lighting. The amount of pollution produced is dependent on how the energy is generated.

Greenhouses commonly supplement [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] levels to 3–4 times the atmospheric rate. This increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases photosynthesis rates by 50%, contributing to higher yields.&lt;ref name="Blom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Dioxide In Greenhouses|last=Blom|first=T.J.|author2=W.A. Straver |author3=F.J. Ingratta |author4=Shalin Khosla |author5= Wayne Brown |url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/00-077.htm|date=December 2002|accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some greenhouses burn fossil fuels purely for this purpose, as other CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sources, such as those from furnaces, contain pollutants such as [[sulphur dioxide]] and [[ethylene]] which significantly damage plants.&lt;ref name="Blom"/&gt;  This means a vertical farm requires a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; source, most likely from [[combustion]]. Also, necessary ventilation may allow CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to leak into the atmosphere.

Greenhouse growers commonly exploit [[photoperiodism]] in plants to control whether the plants are in a vegetative or reproductive stage. As part of this control, the lights stay on past sunset and before sunrise or periodically throughout the night. Single story greenhouses have attracted criticism over [[light pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=61B_RV3EdIcC|page=163}}|title=Light pollution handbook – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |accessdate=2010-11-10|isbn=978-1-4020-2665-2|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydroponic greenhouses regularly change the water, producing water containing fertilizers and pesticides that must be disposed of. The most common method of spreading the effluent over neighbouring farmland or [[wetlands]] would be more difficult for an urban vertical farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/greenhouse/nursery/environ/wmrecyc.html |title=Treating and Recycling Irrigation Runoff |publisher=Aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, Vertical Harvest was raising funds for an urban, small-scale vertical farm in [[Jackson Hole]], [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/vertical-harvest-of-jackson-hole-will-grow-organic-produce-even-in-the-winter/|title=Vertical Harvest of Jackson Hole Will Grow Organic Produce Even in the Winter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Many of VF's potential benefits are obtained from scaling up hydroponic or [[aeroponic]] growing methods.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"&gt;{{cite web |last= Despommier |first= D. |title= Vertical Farm Essay I |publisher= Vertical Farm |date= 2008 |url= http://www.verticalfarm.com/essay_print.htm |accessdate= 2009-06-26 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090701091951/http://www.verticalfarm.com/essay_print.htm |archivedate= 2009-07-01 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study estimated that the value of four ecosystem services provided by existing vegetation in urban areas was on the order of $33 billion annually. The study's quantitative framework projected annual food production of 100–180 million tonnes, energy savings ranging from 14 to 15 billion kilowatt hours, nitrogen sequestration between 100,000 and 170,000 tonnes and stormwater runoff reductions between 45 and 57 billion cubic meters annually. Food production, nitrogen fixation, energy savings, pollination, climate regulation, soil formation and biological pest control could be worth as much as $80–160 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clinton|first=Nicholas|last2=Stuhlmacher|first2=Michelle|last3=Miles|first3=Albie|last4=Uludere Aragon|first4=Nazli|last5=Wagner|first5=Melissa|last6=Georgescu|first6=Matei|last7=Herwig|first7=Chris|last8=Gong|first8=Peng|date=2018-01-01|title=A Global Geospatial Ecosystem Services Estimate of Urban Agriculture|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017EF000536/abstract|journal=Earth's Future|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=40–60|doi=10.1002/2017ef000536|issn=2328-4277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation for the future===
It is estimated that by the year 2050, the world's population will increase by 3 billion people and close to 80% will live in urban areas.&lt;ref name=vf&gt;{{cite web|website=The Vertical Farm Project |year=2009 |title=Agriculture for the 21st Century and Beyond |url=http://www.verticalfarm.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical farms have the potential to reduce or eliminate the need to create additional farmland.&lt;ref name=vf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frediani |first=K. L. |title=Feeding time at the Zoo. |journal=The Horticulturalist |date=April 2010 |pp=12–15 |publisher=Institute of Horticulture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frediani |first=K. L. |date= October 2011|title=High rise food |journal=The Horticulturalist |pp=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased crop production===
Unlike traditional farming in non-tropical areas, indoor farming can produce crops year-round. All-season farming multiplies the productivity of the farmed surface by a factor of 4 to 6 depending on the crop. With crops such as strawberries, the factor may be as high as 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Despommier |first= D. |title= Vertical Farm Essay I|publisher= Vertical Farm |date= 2008 |url= http://www.verticalfarm.com/?page_id=36 |accessdate= 2009-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Vertical Farm Video |publisher= Discovery Channel |date= 2009-04-23 |url= http://watch.discoverychannel.ca/daily-planet/april-2009/daily-planet-april-23-2009/#clip164926 |accessdate= 2009-06-26 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090510091346/http://watch.discoverychannel.ca/daily-planet/april-2009/daily-planet-april-23-2009/#clip164926 |archive-date= 2009-05-10 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as the crops would be consumed where they are grown, long-distance transport with its accompanying time delays, should reduce spoilage, infestation and energy needs. Globally some 30% of harvested crops are wasted due to spoilage and infestation, though this number is much lower in developed nations.&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt;

Despommier suggests that once dwarf versions of crops (e.g. [[dwarf wheat]] which is smaller in size but richer in nutrients&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web| title = Dwarf Wheat grown aboard the International Space Station | publisher = NASA| date = 9 February 2003| url = http://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/abstracts.php?p=2889| accessdate = 17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), year-round crops and "stacker" plant holders are accounted for, a 30-story building with a base of a building block ({{convert|5|acre|ha|0|order=flip}}) would yield a yearly crop analogous to that of {{convert|2400|acre|ha|order=flip|sigfig=1}} of traditional farming.&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt;

===Weather disruption===
Crops grown in traditional outdoor farming depend on supportive weather, and suffer from undesirable temperatures rain, monsoon, hailstorm, tornadoe, flooding, wildfires and drought.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"/&gt; "Three recent floods (in 1993, 2007 and 2008) cost the United States billions of dollars in lost crops, with even more devastating losses in topsoil. Changes in rain patterns and temperature could diminish India's agricultural output by 30 percent by the end of the century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/opinion/10pollan.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Big Food vs. Big Insurance|last=Pollan|first=Michael|date=2009-09-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VF productivity is mostly independent of weather, although earthquakes and tornadoes still pose threats.

=== Conservation ===
Up to 20 units of outdoor farmland per unit of VF could return to its natural state,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/24/opinion/24Despommier.html|title=Opinion {{!}} A Farm on Every Floor|last=Despommier|first=Dickson D.|date=2009-08-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainweb.org/pdf/11/ch_vertical_farming.pdf Vertical take off], ''Fresh Produce Journal'', 28 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; due to VR's increased productivity.

Vertical farming would thus reduce the amount of farmland, thus saving many natural resources.&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Despommier| first = Dickson| authorlink = Dickson Despommier| title = The Rise of Vertical Farms| journal = Scientific American| volume = 301| issue = 5| pages = 60–67| publisher = Scientific American Inc.| location = New york| date = November 2009| url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-rise-of-vertical-farms| issn = 0036-8733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation and [[desertification]] caused by agricultural encroachment on natural [[biome]]s could be avoided. Producing food indoors reduces or eliminates conventional plowing, planting, and harvesting by farm machinery, protecting soil and reducing emissions.

===Resource scarcity===
The scarcity of fertilizer components like phosphorus&lt;ref name="phosphorus"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100311092124.htm Expertanswer. "Scarcity of phosphorus threat to global food production". ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 17 March 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; poses a threat to industrial agriculture. The closed-cycle design of vertical farm systems minimizes the loss of nutrients, while traditional field agriculture loses nutrients to runoff and leeching.&lt;ref name="runoff"&gt;[https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR009i003p00658 Timmons, D. R., et al. “Nitrogen and Phosphorus Losses in Surface Runoff from Agricultural Land as Influenced by Placement of Broadcast Fertilizer.” Water Resources Research , June 1973, doi:https://doi.org/10.1029/WR009i003p00658.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass extinction===
Withdrawing human activity from large areas of the Earth's land surface may be necessary to address [[Holocene extinction event|anthropogenic mass extinction]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

Traditional agriculture disrupts wild populations and may be [[Ethics of eating meat#Argument that plant consumption also kills animals|unethical]] given a viable alternative. One study showed that [[wood mouse]] populations dropped from 25 per hectare to 5 per hectare after harvest, estimating 10 animals killed per hectare each year with conventional farming.&lt;ref name="sldavis"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human health===
Traditional farming is a hazardous occupation that often affects the health of farmers. Such risks include: exposure to infectious diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[schistosomes]], exposure to toxic pesticides and fungicides, confrontations with wildlife such as venomous snakes, and injuries that can occur when using large industrial farming equipment. VF reduces some of these risks.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"/&gt; The modern industrial food system makes unhealthy food cheap while fresh produce is more expensive, encouraging poor eating habits. These habits lead to health problems such as [[obesity]], [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]]. 

===Poverty and culture===
Food security is one of the primary factors leading to absolute poverty.  Constructing farms will allow continued growth of culturally significant food items without sacrificing sustainability or basic needs, which can be significant to the recovery of a society from poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/anthropology/21a-265-food-and-culture-spring-2011/|title=Food and Culture Spring 2011 course|work=ocw.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban growth===
Vertical farming, used in conjunction with other technologies and socioeconomic practices, could allow cities to expand while remaining substantially self-sufficient in food. This would allow large urban centers to grow without food constraints.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"/&gt;

===Energy sustainability===
Vertical farms could exploit [[methane digesters]] to generate energy.  Methane digesters could be built on site to transform the organic waste generated at the farm into [[biogas]] that is generally composed of 65% methane along with other gases. This biogas could then be burned to generate electricity for the greenhouse.&lt;ref&gt;Case Study&amp;nbsp;— Landfill Power Generation, H.

==Technologies and devices==
Vertical farming relies on the use of various physical methods to become effective. Combining these technologies and devices in an integrated whole is necessary to make Vertical Farming a reality. Various methods are proposed and under research. The most common technologies suggested are:

* [[Greenhouses]]
* The [[Folkewall]] and other vertical growing architectures&lt;ref name="Folkewalls"&gt;{{cite web|author=Folke Günther |url=http://www.holon.se/folke/projects/openliw/openlev_en.shtml |title=The folkewall, greywater purification AND vertical growing |publisher=Holon.se |date=2013-01-06 |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aeroponics]]
* [[Agricultural robot]]
* [[Aquaponics]]
* [[Composting]]
* [[Controlled-environment agriculture]]

In 2009, the world's first pilot production system was installed at Paignton Zoo Environmental Park in the United Kingdom. The project showcased vertical farming and provided a physical base to conduct research into sustainable urban food production. The produce is used to feed the zoo's animals while the project enables evaluation of the systems and provides an educational resource to advocate for change in unsustainable land use practices that impact upon global biodiversity and [[ecosystem services]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgci.org/files/Dublin2010/papers/Frediani-Kevin.pdf|title=Vertical plant production as a public exhibit at Paignton Zoo|publisher= Proceedings of the 4th World Botanic Garden Congress, Botanic Gardens Conservation International|date= June 2010 |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Association for Vertical Farming]] (AVF) was founded in Munich (Germany). By May 2015 the AVF had expanded with regional chapters all over Europe, Asia, USA, Canada and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agritecture.com/post/92942014432/vertical-farming-infoday-munich-what-is-the-avf4 |title= vertical farming infoday munich - agritecture.com | accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This organization unites growers and inventors to improve food security and sustainable development.
