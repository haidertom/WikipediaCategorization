      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4907">'''AVT Statistical filtering algorithm''' is an approach to improving quality of raw data collected from various sources. It is most effective in cases when there is inband noise present. In those cases AVT is better at filtering data then, [[band-pass filter]] or any digital filtering based on variation of.

Conventional filtering is useful when signal/data has different frequency than noise and signal/data is separated/filtered by frequency discrimination of noise. Frequency discrimination filtering is done using Low Pass, High Pass and Band Pass filtering which refers to relative frequency filtering criteria target for such configuration. Those filters are created using passive and active components and sometimes are implemented using software algorithms based on FFT.

AVT filtering is implemented in software and its inner working is based on statistical analysis of raw data.

When signal frequency/(useful data distribution frequency) coincides with noise frequency/(noisy data distribution frequency) we have inband noise. In this situations frequency discrimination filtering does not work since the noise and useful signal are indistinguishable and where AVT excels. To achieve filtering in such conditions there are several methods/algorithms available which are briefly described below.

== Averaging Algorithm ==
#Collect n samples of data
#Calculate average value of collected data
#Present/record result as actual data

== Median Algorithm ==
#Collect n samples of data
#Sort the data in ascending or descending order. Note that order does not matter
#Select the data that happen to be in n/2 position and present/record it as final result representing data sample

== AVT Algorithm ==
[[File:AVT inner working.png|thumb|AVT inner working]]
AVT algorithm stands for Antonyan Vardan Transform and its implementation explained below.
#Collect n samples of data
#Calculate the standard deviation and average value
#Drop any data that is greater or less than average ± one standard deviation  
#Calculate average value of remaining data
#Present/record result as actual value representing data sample

This algorithm is based on amplitude discrimination and can easily reject any noise that is not like actual signal, otherwise statistically different then 1 standard deviation of the signal. Note that this type of filtering can be used in situations where the actual environmental noise is not known in advance.

==Filtering algorithms comparison==
Using a system that has signal value of 1 and has noise added at 0.1% and 1% levels will simplify quantification of algorithm performance. The R&lt;ref name="r-project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.r-project.org/ |title=The R Project for Statistical Computing |publisher=r-project.org|accessdate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; script is used to create pseudo random noise added to signal and analyze the results of filtering using several algorithms. Please refer to "Reduce Inband Noise with the AVT Algorithm" &lt;ref name="electronicdesign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronicdesign.com/embedded/reduce-inband-noise-avt-algorithm |title=Reduce Inband Noise with the AVT Algorithm &amp;#124; Embedded content from Electronic Design |publisher=electronicdesign.com|accessdate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; article for details.
This graphs show that AVT algorithm provides best results compared with Median and Averaging algorithms while using data sample size of 32, 64 and 128 values. Note that this graph was created by analyzing random data array of 10000 values. Sample of this data is graphically represented below.&lt;br/&gt;

[[File:AVT test data sample.png|AVT test data sample]]

==AVT algorithm variations==

===Cascaded AVT===
In some situations better results can be obtained by cascading several stages of AVT filtering. This will produce singular constant value which can be used for equipment that has known stable characteristics like thermometers, thermistors and other slow acting sensors.

===Reverse AVT===
#Collect n samples of data
#Calculate the standard deviation and average value
#Drop any data that is within one standard deviation ± average band
#Calculate average value of remaining data
#Present/record result as actual data
This is useful for detecting minute signals that are close to background noise level.

==Possible applications and uses==
*Used in planet detection to filter out raw data from [[Kepler (spacecraft)]]
*Filter out noise from sound sources where all other filtering methods ([[Low-pass filter]], [[High-pass filter]], [[Band-pass filter]], [[Digital filter]]) fail.
*Preprocess scientific data for data analysis ([[Smoothness]]) before plotting see ([[Plot (graphics)]])
*Used in SETI ([[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence]]) for detecting/distinguishing extraterrestrial signals from cosmic background

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]]''' ('''FOI''') refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Access to public information builds on the principle that in a democratic system people should be in the condition of accessing a wide range of information in order to effectively participate in public life as well as on matters affecting them.

The right of access to public information is a component of the fundamental right of [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] set forth by Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948) which states that the fundamental right of freedom of expression encompasses the freedom "to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers". Access to public information and freedom of information are recognised as human rights in the three main regional systems of human rights, namely within the Americas, Europe and Africa, as well as in major international instruments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, The Public's Right to Know. Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation, 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to access information places two obligations on public bodies. First, the proactive duty  to make public key information on the activities of authorities and governments; second, the reactive obligation to respond to  people's requests for information, either by releasing public original documents or copies of the documents held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), LegalLeaks - Toolkit. A guide for journalists on how to access governmental information, June 2014.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past 10 years, the right to information and access to public information has been recognised in an increasing number of countries and several [[Freedom of information laws by country|FOI laws]] have been adopted all over the world, including in the developing countries. If in 1990 only 13 countries had a national freedom of information law, today there are 100 such laws across the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information/ UNESCO.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, Statement by European RTI Community on the world's First Official Access to Information Day, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 The [[UNESCO]] General Conference voted to designate Sept. 28 as "International Day for the Universal Access to Information" or, as it is more commonly known, [[Access to Information Day]]. The date had previously been celebrated as "Right to Know Day" since 2002.  The UNESCO resolution recommends approval by the [[UN General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2015/11/unesco-names-sept-28-access-to-information-day/|title=UNESCO Names Sept. 28 Access to Information Day|last=|first=|date=17 November 2015|publisher=freedominfo.org|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{See also|Freedom of information}}
{{See also|Freedom of information laws by country}}

The right to access information builds on the principle that the public has a right to know how power is exercised and public money is spent, given that public bodies are elected by people and sustained by taxpayers. The access to public information is a precondition  for governments' and public officials' accountability and it enables the adoption of informed decisions by citizens, hence representing a fundamental element for the proper functioning of democratic systems. International standards and evolving jurisprudence have confirmed that information held by public bodies belong to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/what-is-the-right-to-know Access-Info Europe, What is the right to know?{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents]] (2009) states that "all official documents are in principle public and can be withheld subject only to the protection of other rights and legitimate interests".&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680084826 Council of Europe, Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents. Council of Europe Treaty Series - No. 205, 2009.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 100 countries around the world have now adopted national [[Freedom of information laws by country|access to information laws]] to make the right to know effective. The first law on access to public information was adopted in [[Sweden]] in 1766, but after that one should wait almost one century to have the second law approved in [[Finland]] in 1951 and in the [[United States]] in 1966. During the 1970s and 1980s there has been a small but constant growth in FOI's laws, with a real expansion after 1989 due to the activism of civil society groups in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] during the post-Communist transitions to democracy. Indeed, the big push forward in the field of access to information leading to the broadening of the definition and of the scope of the right of access to information came together with a coordinated civil society reaction to contrast the control over the information exercised by Communist regimes in the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]]. It was this movement which gave a sound contribution to the development of access to information as a right in the sense of a human right. A 1992 decision of the Hungary's Constitutional Court established that access to information is a "fundamental right" essential for citizen oversight on the lawfulness and efficiency of the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/CriticalPerspectivesonRightofAccesstoInfo_HelenDarbishire.pdf Helen Darbishire, "Ten Challenges for the Right to Information in the Era of Mega-Leaks"] in Tarlach McGonagle and Yvonne Donders (edited by), The United Nations and Freedom of Expression and Information. Critical perspectives, June 2015, {{ISBN|9781107083868}} {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, environmentalist groups and consumer associations also contributed to the affirmation of the right to know.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessinitiative.org/sites/default/files/companies_and_the_right_to_access_public_information.pdf Associación por los Derechos Civiles; Instituto del Banco Mundial; Inter-American Investment Corporation, 2007, Companies and the right to access public information. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-24}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

All the eight former communists countries which joined the [[Enlargement of the European Union|European Union in 2004]] had a freedom of information law; also [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] had their own law when joined the EU in 2007 and [[Croatia]] had already had an access to information law in force for ten years when it joined the EU in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/CriticalPerspectivesonRightofAccesstoInfo_HelenDarbishire.pdf Helen Darbishire, June 2015. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-20}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, in the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] region 48 of the 56 member states have specific access to information laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to access information places two obligations on governments and public bodies. First, the duty to make public key information on the activities implemented by public bodies; second, the obligation to respond to people's requests of accessing documents, either by making available the original documents or by sharing copies of documents and information held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to information is a right which comprises two parts. The first is a proactive component, namely the positive obligation of public bodies to provide, make public and disseminate information about their activities, budgets and policies so that citizens can understand what public bodies are doing, can participate in public life and can monitor the behaviour of public authorities. The second component is a reactive one, entailing the right of all persons to requests information and documents to public bodies, along with the right to receive an answer. In principle, all the main information held by public bodies should be available, while exceptions to disclosure should be grounded on the protection of other values, such as privacy, national security or commercial interests.

On the occasion of the first officially recognised [[Access to Information Day]] celebrated on 28 September 2016, European civil society groups working to enhance the right of access to public information raised some concerns as, despite significant progress, there are still far-reaching shortcomings especially with regard to transparency of decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt; According to such organisations, among the main obstacles to government openness there is the inadequate record keeping of public bodies’ information: minutes of public officials’ meetings are not recorded, exchange with lobbyists are not available, public decisions are adopted without proper justification or documented evidence available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/decision-making-transparency Access-Info Europe, Opening up decision-making. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt; An additional problem concerns the over-application of exceptions with particular regard to the use of the privacy reasons, applied to not disclose the activities of public officials when performing public functions. Moreover, European civil society organisations are particularly concerned for the lack of transparency around the decision-making process at both national and EU level, as in the case of the refusal by the EU to disclose documents on the [[EU-Turkey refugee deal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to information as a human right==

A big push forward the advancement of the right to access information as a fundamental right was due to the activism of civil society movements which contrasted the regimes' control over information in the Communist countries in the Soviet bloc. A fundamental document in this sense is a 1992's decision of the Hungarian Constitutional Court which established that access to information is a "fundamental right" essential for citizen oversight on the lawfulness and efficiency of the government.&lt;ref&gt;See Decision 32/1992 (V.29) AB, 183-84 (as translated by the Office of the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information)&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressively, several national and international courts decisions have been treating access to information as a basic human right, thus providing a strong legal case for citizens resorting to courts to defend any refusals by authorities to provide access to public information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such decisions are grounded on a series of international declarations, human rights covenants and conventions at international, regional and EU levels. In the first place, the right to access public information is recognised as a fundamental right and as a component of the right of freedom of expression in the Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]; in the Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights]]; and in the Article 13 of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]]. At regional level, all the three main regional systems of human rights, namely within the Americas, Europe and Africa, have recognised freedom of information as a universal human right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] confirmed that the right to freedom of expression enshrined in Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] includes the right of access public information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the European Union level, Article 42 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|European Charter of Fundamental Rights]] establishes the right of access to EU institutions documents, as recognised also by Article 15 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|Treaty on the Functioning of the EU]] ("Treaty of Lisbon"). In 2009, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] on the basis of Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which is the article on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], acknowledged the fundamental right of access to information held by public bodies. Specifically, the Court established that the right to information is protected in particular in case of "[[information monopoly]]", namely when the public bodies are the only ones owning the requested information, and when the information is needed by media or civil society organisations for public accountability purposes. The decision of the European Court embraced a 2006 decision by the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] which endorsed Article 13 of the [[American Convention on Human Rights|American Human Rights convention]] stating that individuals have the right to request information to public authorities and public authorities have the positive obligation to provide such information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, many countries across the world recognise the right to information or access to documents in their [[Constitution]]s, either within the frame of the right to freedom of expression or separately and specifically as the right of access to information or documents. At least 50 countries all over the world, including 29 [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] countries, have Constitutions including such provisions .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal benefits of access to public information: accountability, participation, efficiency==
[[Transparency (behavior)|Transparency]] enhanced through the right to access public information entails a series of core benefits for democratic societies, in particular [[accountability]], [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] and efficiency. First, access to public information enhances public accountability as it contributes to make governments and public officials more accountable for their actions and decisions. Second, the right to know boost people participation as it makes available information that can help citizens to make more effective decisions on matters that directly affect their lives and to participate with informed opinions in public debates and in the decision-making process. Third, access to public  information contributes to the efficiency of decision-making as disclosure encourages public institutions to better manage and organise information and may help to improve communication between public bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, access to information serve some other social goals. For instance, access to medical records can help individuals to improve personal decision-making and make better decisions about medical treatment, financial planning and the like. Finally, access to information can facilitate effective business practices as some of the information held by public bodies related to economic issues can be very useful for enterprises and can therefore contribute to increasing the effectiveness of the business sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, International 7standards: Right to information. 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessinitiative.org/sites/default/files/companies_and_the_right_to_access_public_information.pdf Associación por los Derechos Civiles; Instituto del Banco Mundial; Inter-American Investment Corporation, 2007. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-24}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International standards and laws==
At national level access to public information is regulated by [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information laws]]. In addition to national legislation, principles and standards for access to public information are set forth into several international declarations and treaties that have authoritatively recognised the fundamental and legal nature of the right to freedom of information along with the need for effective legislations that should guarantee the respect of that right in practice.&lt;ref&gt;.[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such international laws and standards include:

* '''Civil society standards and declarations''': these include the Ten Principles on the Right to Know by the Justice Initiative (2005); the Public's Right to Know - Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation by Article 19 (1999); the Atlanta Declaration and Plan of Action for the Advancement of the Right of Access to Information (2008); the Budapest Declaration on Right of Access to Information (2008); the Transparency Charter for International Financial Institutions: Claiming our Right to Know by the Global Transparency Initiative (2006); the Declaration on Parliamentary Openness (2012);
* '''International treaties''': these include the [[Council of Europe Convention on Access to Documents]] (2009) and the [[Aarhus Convention]] on Access to Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (1999);
* '''Inter-governmental Principles and Recommendations''': these include the Principles on the Right of Access to Information by the [[Organization of American States|Organisation of American States]] (2000); the [[Council of Europe]] Recommendation 2002(2) on access to official documents (2002); the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa by the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights]] (2002); the [[UNESCO]]'s Maputo Declaration on Fostering Freedom of Expression, Access to Information and Empowerment of People (2008); the [[UNESCO]]'s Brisbane Declaration on Freedom of Information; the Dakar Declaration on Media and Good Governance (2005);
* '''Annual reports of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression''': the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|UN Special Rapporteur]] has addressed the issue of freedom of information in its annual reports since 1997. After that, the Commission on Human Rights endorsed the commentaries of the Special Rapporteur and asked him to elaborate further on the right to seek and receive information. As a consequence, the UN Special Rapporteur expanded significantly his commentary on freedom of information in his 2000 annual Reports.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, International standards: Right to information. 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to public information: guiding principles==
The non-governmental organisation [[Article 19|ARTICLE 19]] has published a set of principles called "The Public's Right To Know: Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation" which describes the best practices and standards on freedom of information legislation based on international and regional laws as well as on evolving national practices and legislations. Such principles, which are designed mainly for national laws, are also applicable to inter-governmental bodies such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, The Public's Right to Know. Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 1: Maximum disclosure===
The principle of maximum disclosure sets a presumption that all information held by public bodies should be covered by the scope of access to information laws. This presumption accepts only limited circumstances for exceptions. This principle incorporates the very basic rationale underpinning the concept of freedom of information. It entails that public authorities seeking to deny access to public information have the obligation to justifying their refusal. The principle of maximum disclosure provides for a broad definition of "public bodies" which are subject to the duty of releasing information. Such a broad interpretation includes all branches of government, e.g. local governments, elected bodies, nationalised industries and public corporations, judicial bodies and also private bodies carrying out public functions. Principle 1 requires the law to establish minimum standards regarding the maintenance and preservation of documents by public bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 2: Obligation to publish===
This principle implies the obligation for public bodies to respond to access to information requests and to publish and disseminate documents of public interest. Few reasonable limits based, for instance, on resources and capacity can be accepted. As a minimum, public authorities should make public the following types of information:
* operational information on the functioning of public bodies, including objectives, results and costs;
* information on any requests or complaints that people may take in relation of a given public body;
* information on how members of the public may provide their contribution to the policy-making process;
* the types and formats of information held by public bodies;
* information on decisions and policies affecting the public, along with background information on those decisions and the evidence that led to their formulation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 3: Promotion of open government===
This principle calls governments to actively promote a culture of openness in order to enhance the respect of the right to know. This is important as experiences in different countries have shown that recalcitrant public authorities can undermine the application of even the most progressive legislations. National laws should therefore allocate adequate resources to the promotion of an [[open government]] culture and the goals of FOI laws, including by means of internal codes on access and openness, educational programmes, media coverage and communications campaigns. Such activities should also be aimed at contrasting the culture of official secrecy within government for example through trainings for public officials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt; An important step in this direction has been adopted in 2011 with the establishment of a new global alliance of democratic countries committed to the promotion of transparency, accountability and participation under the label [[Open Government Partnership]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/CriticalPerspectivesonRightofAccesstoInfo_HelenDarbishire.pdf Helen Darbishire, June 2015. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-20}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 4: Limited scope of exceptions===
Exceptions to disclosure should be grounded on clearly and narrowly defined exceptions. Public authorities should show that a refusal to provide the required information has passed a test through which to assess if the disclosure of a given information threaten to cause substantial harm to a legitimate aim and if the harm is greater than the public interest in having the information. Non-disclosure decisions should be taken on a case-by-case basis. National laws should provide an exhaustive list of the legitimate reasons that may justify non-disclosure. Such a list should be narrowly defined and include only highly relevant interests to be protected, such as [[law enforcement]], [[privacy]], [[national security]], commercial and other confidentiality, public or individual safety and the integrity of the decision-making process. However, even if can be demonstrated that disclosure would cause substantial harm to a legitimate interest, the information should be released when the benefits of disclosure prevail over the harm. In other words, the harm to the legitimate interest must be weighed against the public interest in having a given information publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 5: Processes to facilitate access===
According to this principle requests for public information should be processed quickly and fairly and an independent review of any refusals should be made available to the applicant. Also, public bodies are called to set up open, accessible systems for implementing freedom of information laws and thus ensuring the public's right to receive the required information. Furthermore, the law should establish an individual right to [[appeal]] to an independent body for any refusal by a public body to release information. All members of the public should be in the condition of accessing to appeal procedures without incurring in undue costs and complicated procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 6: Costs===
This principle states that costs for accessing public information should not be so high as to deter applicants from making the request. Around the world there are different cost regimes, including, for instance, flat fees systems for each request and graduated fees depending on the actual cost of retrieving and reproducing the information and / or the documents requested.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 7: Open meetings===
Freedom of information comprises the public's right to know how the government behaves on behalf of people and to participate to decision-making. Freedom of information law should thus incorporates the presumption that all relevant meetings of governing bodies, i.e. those involved in decision-making, should be open to the public. Meetings may be closed, but only when sound reasons for closure exist. Such reasons have to be clearly explained and closure have to comply to established procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 8: Disclosure takes precedence===
Other laws dealing with publicly held information should be consistent with the principle of maximum disclosure and the other principles underpinning freedom of information. In particular, the regime of exceptions  should be clearly defined in the freedom of information legislation; extensions of the exceptions regime should not be allowed by other laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 9: Protection for whistleblowers===
[[Whistleblower]]s, i.e. individuals who make publicly available information on government's wrongdoings - including for instance corruption, dishonesty, maladministration, serious threat to health, safety or the environment, etc. - should be protected from any legal, administrative or other kind of sanctions. In this context the public interest refers to situations where the benefit of disclosure prevails over the harm, no matter how the disclosure has been conducted. This applies in particular when there are exceptionally serious reasons for releasing a certain information, such as a serious threat to public health or safety, or when there is a strong evidence that wrongdoing will be concealed or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to public information: main features==

===Universal access===
Being a fundamental and universal right, in principle access to information is a right to everyone: almost all national [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information laws]] recognise this by establishing that "anyone" may make a request to access public information. One noteworthy exception among the world's democracies is [[Canada]] where only citizens and residents are entitled to submit access to information requests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, a major practical obstacle to the universal exercise of the right to access information is due to the obligation to submit the requests in the official language of the country which may hamper the exercise of the right to know for people that does not have a command of a country's official language.

In the EU, according to the treaties the right to access documents and the right to appeal to the [[European Ombudsman]] applies only to EU citizens, residents and companies registered inside the EU. While in general anyone whose right has been violated can appeal to the [[European Court of Justice]], in the case of the right to access information the Court is obliged to accept cases made by EU citizens, residents and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kind of information and documents to be made available under access to information laws===
In principle, all information held by public bodies can be accessed upon a FOI's request, unless some exceptions can be applied (e.g. on the ground of protecting state interests; private interests or human rights, or to ensure effective governments). Some national laws refer to "access to information" while others to "access to documents": even if these definitions actually overlap, it can be useful for the applicant to be aware of the exact phrasing used by the law in order to formulate properly the access to information request, and thus, having more chance of success. Usually "documents" and "information" should be made available whatever its medium, e.g. written on paper or in electronic format, or as a sound, visual or audiovisual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The EU Regulation 1049/2001 specifies that documents subject to access to information are those concerning "policies, activities and decisions falling within the institutions’ sphere of responsibility" and this applies to all documents held by the EU institutions "in all areas of activity of the European Union".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/register/pdf/r1049_en.pdf REGULATION (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public bodies concerned by access to information===
In general in Europe the right of access to information applies to all administrative bodies, at any level of government, from central government to local authorities. Some rare exceptions to this can be found, as in the case of [[Ireland]] where police forces are exempted. In addition to administrative bodies, in national legislations which have been progressively approved the obligation to disclose information has been extended also to legislative and judicial bodies. Moreover, in many countries also some private bodies performing public functions or receiving public funds are obliged to respond to access to information requests. For instance, in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] which adopted an access to information law in 2006, the right to access applies to local and national governments, legislative bodies and judicial authorities, and encompasses also private bodies with public functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inter-governmental organisations====
Many inter-governmental bodies hold information about policies and decisions affecting people's lives. While the EU has defined a set of rules regulating access to information held by EU institutions, the debate is still open about whether the right of access information applies to inter-governmental organisations which are outside the scope of national laws and have not signed international human rights conventions. Campaigning organisations have worked for the adoption of internal rules - called "disclosure policies" or "access to information policies" - so that inter-governmental organisations could apply rules similar to national access to information laws. The [[World Bank]] adopted its Access to Information Policy in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard exceptions to the right to information==
Although in  principles the right of access to information applies to all information held by public bodies, it is not an absolute right as there can be some exceptions not allowing the disclosure of certain kind of information. If released this information can violate some "legitimate interests", disturb public life or undermine other societal values. To justify the withhold of public information, authorities have the burden of the proof, thus have to demonstrate that disclosure would cause harm to a legitimate interest as specified by the law.

International laws and standards in the field of access to public information provide for three categories of standard exceptions. Specifically,

'''Exceptions to protect state interests or international relations''', such as:
* National security and defence of the state;
* International relations;
* Public safety or public order;
* Economic, monetary and exchange rate policies of the state;

'''Exceptions aimed at ensuring effective government''':
* Protection of internal public bodies’ deliberations prior to decision-making (known as "space to think" exception);
* Protection of criminal enquiries;

'''Exceptions to protect private interests and human rights''', such as:
* Privacy and other legitimate private interests;
* Commercial and other economic interests like, for instance, trade secrets;
* The environment;
* Guaranteeing the effective administration of justice and equality of parties before the courts.

However, even if the requested information or documents are sensitive and exceptions apply, some part of it could be released by public bodies on the ground of two factors. The first is the right of partial access according to which authorities have the duty of removing sensitive information and release the rest of the document. The second "exception to exceptions" applies when transparency overrides secrecy, thus even if the information is sensitive the public interest in knowing it is stronger. In this particular case public officials have to apply the so-called "public interest test", meaning that they have to scrutinize and ponder both the exceptions for not releasing information and the reasons of public interest in knowing the information required. Many national access to information laws foresees this kind of test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Right to appeal==
Applicant have the [[Appeal|right to appeal]] in case of "[[administrative silence]]" (i.e. the request is not answered), when public authorities reject the disclosure request or when their reply is not satisfying and does not meaningfully answer the question. Rules regulating the right to appeal depends on national legislations and vary from country to country. Generally, there are four main appeals mechanisms:

* '''Internal or Administrative Appeal''': internal review is addressed to the same authority that issued the denial or made a non-satisfying disclosure or to the administrative body which is immediately superior;
* '''Administrative or Higher Court Appeal''': appeal to administrative court is usually the step following internal review. This is regulated by administrative law and the competent authority entitled to examine the appeal are regional or national administrative courts. A further appeal to a higher court, including the [[European Court of Human Rights]], is also possible.
* '''Information Commission/er Appeal''': in this case the appeal is scrutinised by a dedicated body whose specific role is to protect the right to access information. Such bodies can issue binding decisions as well as non-binding recommendations, depending on national laws. The decisions of the [[Information commissioner|Information Commissioner]] can always go to appeal. In the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] region, Information Commissions exist in 16 countries.
* '''Ombudsman Appeal''': in some countries, the [[Ombudsman]] - which is the institution whose role is to protect the rights of citizens vis à vis public authorities - has also the function to examine complains related to access to information. In many cases the Ombudsman's decision is only a recommendation, i.e. a non-binding measure, although usually his/her opinion is taken in due consideration by public authorities. At the EU level, the [[European Ombudsman]] is responsible for processing complaints concerning access to documents.

==Access to public information in practice==

===Request's contents===
Requests for accessing public information to the public authorities covered by the scope of national laws should be as clear and specific as possible about the information or documents required. A well-formulated request will facilitate the work of public officials and will more likely result in a positive answer or at least reducing the reasons for rejecting the request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the name and address of the person filing the request have to be provided. Giving also the e-mail address as well as a phone number might facilitate the exchange with public officials. In some countries requests made by resorting to pseudonyms or anonymously are permitted.

===Procedure===
In general, the procedure for requesting public information under national laws is simple and does not foresees many formalities. Usually requests can be filed in writing, either by post or hand-delivered to the concerned public authority. In most countries, submission is allowed also by e-mail. Moreover, some access to information laws permit oral requests, made, for instance, by phone or in person. However, in some cases, such as in [[Slovenia]], oral request are not considered to be a formal basis for going to appeal. In some countries, such as in [[Armenia]] or [[Romania]], rules and timeframes for written requests and oral requests are different.

===Fees===
Filing a request for accessing public information should always be free of charge, as confirmed by the [[Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents]] which allows only costs for copying and delivering the documents, such as photocopying, postage costs, or costs of reproduction into other formats or materials in case of DVDs or CDs. As a rule, electronic delivery is free of charge. The majority of countries in the [[Council of Europe]] region comply with this rule, even if there are notable exceptions, such as [[Ireland]] and [[Germany]] where, however, the required fees can be significantly reduced on the ground of public interest.

===Modalities of getting the information===
In reply of a formal request of accessing public information, the examination of the required information can be allowed in different ways, including the inspection of original documents; photocopies sent by post or e-mails; copies in DVDs or CDs.

===Timeframes for getting a reply===
There is a great variability across Europe on the timeframes for public authorities to answer requests as well as for notifying the extension of the timeframe for justified reasons or for issuing a refusal. However, the average time is about 15 working days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the countries with the shortest timeframe for response are [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] (1–3 days). On the contrary, the Albanian and Austrian access to information laws give the authorities a period of respectively 40 and 60 days to respond to people's requests. Most national laws allow the extension of the timeframe in case of requests which are particularly complex. In all cases such extension should be notified to the applicant, along with an explanation of the reasons that led to it. At the EU level, the Regulation 1049/2001 establishes 15 working days for issuing a response; an extension of up 15 additional working days may be applied in exceptional cases, for instance when the request relates to long documents or a large number of documents.

The '''act-of-state doctrine''' or '''foreign act of state doctrine''' is a principle in [[English law|English]] and United States law which states that every [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] state is bound to respect the independence of every other sovereign state, and the courts will not sit in judgment of another government's acts done within its own territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Twomey|first=David|title=Business Law: Principles for Today's Commercial Environment|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Masson, OH|isbn=978-0-324-78669-9|pages=G-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name=DLA&gt;Chalk, E., ''et al'', [https://www.lexology.com/library/document.ashx?g=315b1de8-df72-49ff-8b66-829a697c3df9 A reliable decision: foreign act of state doctrine applies in English arbitration], published 16 July 2018, accessed 23 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine is not required by [[international law]] (neither [[customary international law]] nor [[treaty]] law), but it is a principle recognized and adhered to by [[United States federal courts|United States federal and state courts]].&lt;ref&gt;''3rd Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States,'' §443, comment g (citing ''Sabbatino'': "the act of state doctrine . . . must be treated exclusively as an aspect of federal law," 376 U.S. at 425, and stating that "State courts are bound by the federal doctrine, and a decision of a State court sitting in judgment on the act of a foreign state would be subject to review by the Supreme Court.")&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the rationales for the doctrine include respect for other nations' sovereignty and protection of the U.S. [[executive (government)|Executive]]'s prerogative in foreign affairs, both of which may be frustrated by a decision issuing from U.S. courts.&lt;ref&gt;''3rd Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States,'' §443, comment a.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act of State Doctrine enters consideration most often in cases where a foreign sovereign has expropriated the property of a U.S. national located in that foreign territory (e.g. through nationalization). Rather than pursuing recourse through the courts, United States nationals are to take their claims against foreign sovereign governments to the Executive so that the government can either espouse the claims of all U.S. nationals as a group or seek recourse through diplomatic channels. The United States employs the Act of State Doctrine more broadly and with more frequency than other countries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Background==
The Act of State Doctrine, which arose out of [[Thirteen American colonies|colonial]] practice in the 17th Century, entered into American jurisprudence in the case '''''Underhill v. Hernandez''''', {{ussc|168|250|1897}}.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis A. Bradley and Jack L. Goldsmith. ''Foreign Relations Law, 4th ed.''  Wolters Kluwer, 2011. p96&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1892 revolution, General [[José Manuel "Mocho" Hernández]] expelled the existing [[Venezuela]]n government and took control of [[Ciudad Bolivar]], where plaintiff Underhill lived and ran a waterworks system for the city. Underhill, an American citizen, repeatedly applied to Hernandez for an exit passport, but his requests were refused, and Underhill was forced to stay in Ciudad Bolivar and run the waterworks. Hernandez finally relented and allowed Underhill to return to the United States, where he instituted an action to recover damages for his detention in Venezuela. In finding for the Defendant, a New York Court determined that Hernandez had acted in his official capacity as a military commander so his actions were those of the Venezuelan government. The Court therefore refused to hear Underhill's claim against the government based on the Act of State Doctrine. The Court reasoned, "Every sovereign state is bound to respect the independence of every other sovereign state, and the courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another, done within its own territory."&lt;ref&gt;''Underhill v. Hernandez'', 168 U.S. 250, 252 (1897).&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino''==

In ''[[Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino]]'', {{ussc|376|398|1964}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] applied the Act of State Doctrine even where the state action likely violated international law. The case arose when [[Cuba]] nationalized its [[sugar]] industry, taking control of sugar refineries and other companies in the wake of the Cuban revolution. A large number of Americans who had invested in those companies lost their investments without compensation when the Cuban government assumed control. However, despite the loss suffered by United States nationals, the Supreme Court upheld the Act of State Doctrine by assuming the validity of Cuba's domestic action and therefore rejected the claim of US nationals against Cuba for their lost investments.

The ''Sabbatino'' Court stated that although the Doctrine is not found in the [[Constitution]], explicitly or implicitly, it does have "constitutional underpinnings" in the concept of [[separation of powers]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] reasoned that because the Executive had exclusive authority to conduct foreign affairs with other nations on behalf of [[the United States]], disputes arising from the official actions of foreign sovereign powers should not be settled by the Judiciary because those decisions could interfere with the Executive's conduct of foreign affairs.&lt;ref&gt;''Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino'', 376 U.S. 398 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the outcome of the case, Congress enacted {{UnitedStatesCode|22|2370}}, more commonly referred to as the "Second Hickenlooper Amendment", named after the bill's sponsor, [[Bourke B. Hickenlooper]], an [[Iowa]] Senator. Generally, under the Hickenlooper Amendment, courts are not to apply the Act of State Doctrine as a bar against hearing cases of expropriation by a foreign sovereign. There is an exception if the Executive requests that the courts consider the Act of State Doctrine because foreign policy interests may be damaged by judicial interference:
:"this subparagraph shall not be applicable . . . (2) in any case with respect to which the President determines that application of the act of state doctrine is required in that particular case by the foreign policy interests of the United States and a suggestion to this effect is filed on his behalf in that case with the court." &lt;ref&gt;22 U.S.C. 2370(e)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==English law==
The foreign act of state doctrine applies in English law.&lt;ref&gt;United Kingdom Supreme Court, [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/3.html Belhaj and another (Respondents) v Straw and others (Appellants); Rahmatullah (No 1) (Respondent) v Ministry of Defence and another (Appellants)] 17 January 2017, accessed 26 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, the English [[Commercial Court (England and Wales)|Commercial Court]] ruled that it also applies in English [[arbitration]].&lt;ref name=DLA /&gt;

'''Anger management''' is a psycho-therapeutic program for [[anger]] prevention and control. It has been described as deploying anger successfully.&lt;ref name="Schwarts"&gt;Schwarts, Gil. July 2006. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lscDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=%22Anger%20management%22&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Anger%20management%22&amp;f=false Anger Management]'', July 2006 The Office Politic. Men's Health magazine. Emmaus, PA: Rodale, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Anger is frequently a result of frustration, or of feeling blocked or thwarted from something the subject feels is important. Anger can also be a defensive response to underlying fear or feelings of vulnerability or powerlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.union.edu/offices/health-counseling/counseling/_forms/anger-management.pdf|title=Anger Management|publisher=www.union.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anger management programs consider anger to be a motivation caused by an identifiable reason which can be logically analyzed, and if suitable worked toward.&lt;ref name="Schwarts" /&gt; 

== Overview ==

The ideal goal of anger management is to control and regulate [[anger]] so that it does not result in problems.  Anger is an active emotion that calls the person feeling it to respond.&lt;ref name="W. Doyle Gentry 2007"&gt;W. Doyle Gentry, Ph.D. 2007. ''Anger Management for Dummies''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} People get into anger issues because both the instigator and instigated lack interpersonal and social skills to maintain self-control.&lt;ref name="W. Doyle Gentry 2007"/&gt;{{rp|5}} They can train to respond to their anger as unwanted and unpleasant rather than react to its need.&lt;ref name="W. Doyle Gentry 2007"/&gt;{{rp|5}} [[Turning a blind eye]] or forgiveness is a tool to turn anger off.&lt;ref name="W. Doyle Gentry 2007"/&gt;{{rp|5}} Getting enough sleep, exercise and good diet are tools which can assist in preventing anger.&lt;ref name="W. Doyle Gentry 2007"/&gt;{{rp|6}} Professionals who deal with those who have trouble managing anger include occupational therapists, mental health counselors, drug and alcohol counselors, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists.

==History==

The negative effects of anger have been observed throughout history. Advice for countering seemingly uncontrollable rage has been offered by ancient philosophers, pious men, and modern psychologists. In ''[[de Ira]],''&lt;ref name="L.D.Reynolds, M.T.Griffin, E.Fantham"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVWcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=first+extant+copy+of+Seneca+de+beneficiis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LEsEVYjFK8vvaLOqgNAD&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20extant%20copy%20of%20Seneca%20de%20beneficiis&amp;f=false|author =L.

Eidinow) |isbn=0199545561| accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger]] (4 BC – 65 AD) advised for pre-emptively guarding against confrontational situations, perspective taking, and not inciting anger in anger-prone individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, L. A. (1928). De ira [Anger]. In J. W. Basore (Ed. and Trans.), Seneca's moral essays (Vol. 1). London: Heinemann. (Original work written about 45)&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers echoed Seneca with [[Galen]] recommending seeking out a mentor for aid in anger reduction.&lt;ref&gt;(Galen, C. (1963). On the Passions and errors of the soul (P.W. Harkins, Trans.). Columbus, OH: Ohio State University Press. (Original work written about 180)&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Ages, the people would serve as both examples of self-control and mediators of anger-induced disputes.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kemp, S.|author2=Strongman, K. T.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1995|title=Anger theory and management: A historical analysis|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|volume=108|issue=3|pages=397–417|pmid=7573610|jstor=1422897|doi=10.2307/1422897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of intercession for the common people from the wrath of local rulers abound in hagiographies. The story of [[St. Francis of Assisi]] and the metaphorical Wolf of Gubbio is one famous instance.

In modern times, the concept of controlling anger has translated into anger management programs based on the research of psychologists. Classical psychotherapy based anger management interventions originated in the 1970s. Success in treating [[anxiety]] with [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) interventions developed by Meichebaum inspired Novaco to modify the stress inoculation training to be suitable for anger management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Meichenbaum‚ D. H. |year=1975|title=Stress inoculation training|location=New York|publisher=Pergamon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Novaco‚ R. W.|year=1975|title=Anger control: The development and evaluation of an experimental treatment|location=Lexington‚ MA|publisher=D.C. Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress and anger are sufficiently similar that such a modification was able to create a successful branch of treatment. Both stress and anger are caused by external stimuli, mediated by internal processing, and expressed in either adaptive or maladaptive forms. Meichebaum, and later Novaco, used each aspect of experiencing the relevant emotion as an opportunity for improvement to the patient's overall well-being.

== Potential causes for development of problems ==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}

===Medical causes===
Drug addiction, [[alcoholism]], a [[Mental disability (disambiguation)|mental disability]], biochemical changes and [[PTSD]] can all lead to a person committing an aggressive act against another person. Not having sufficient skills on how to handle oneself when faced with aggression can lead to very undesirable outcomes. These factors are typically associated with a heightened chance of anger, but there are other, less-known factors that can lead to people acting in a negative way. Prolonged or intense anger and frustration contributes to physical conditions such as [[headache]]s, digestive problems, [[high blood pressure]] and [[heart disease]]. Problems dealing with angry feelings may be linked to psychological disorders such as anxiety or [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Angry outbursts can be a way of trying to cope with unhappiness or depression.

'''Migraines''': Frequent [[migraine]] can be associated with levels of aggression and the need for anger management. A 2013 study examined migraines and its association with anger problems in young children (m = 11.2 years of age).  The patients in the study were split into low migraine attack frequency (AF), intermediate AF, high frequency, and chronic migraine AF. The tendency for a participant to inhibit their anger and not lash out was found more in children with higher AF.  Children that qualified for low migraine AF actually had more anger expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tarantino, S.|author2=De Ranieri, C.|author3=Dionisi, C.|author4=Citti, M.|author5=Capuano, A.|author6=Galli, F.|author7=Valeriani, M.|displayauthors=etal|lastauthoramp=y|year=2013|title=Clinical features, anger management and anxiety: A possible correlation in migraine children|journal=The Journal of Headache and Pain|volume=14|issue=1|page=39|doi=10.1186/1129-2377-14-39|pmc=3653764|pmid=23651123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychosocial causes===
Psychosocial factors such as stress, abuse, poor social or familial situations, and poverty can cause anger problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://www.nasponline.org/publications/booksproducts/nas-cbiii-05-1001-009-r02.pdf|title=Children's Needs III|chapter=Anger and Aggression|author1=John E.

Bear|editor2=Kathleen M. Minke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trauma ===
A history of [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], particularly sexual trauma, can result in anger management problems.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

== Types of treatment ==

Some effective anger management techniques include relaxation techniques, monitored breathing exercises, [[cognitive restructuring]] and [[guided imagery|imagery]] (e.g. Stosny's '''H'''ealing imagery '''E'''xplain oneself emphatically what and why it makes you respond angrily '''A'''pply kindness and compassion to self '''L'''ove oneself '''S'''olving the co-morbid problems phases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200506/the-lion-tamer|title=The Lion Tamer|work=Psychology Today|author=Cecilia Capuzzi Simon|date=July 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;), problem solving,  improving communication strategies and interpersonal skills ('''DEAR MAN''' &amp; '''GIVE''').&lt;ref&gt;APA, apa.org 2013. ''Controlling anger before it controls you, [http://www.apa.org/topics/anger/control.aspx?item=4 Strategies To Keep Anger At Bay]'', part 4. Washington, DC: APA's Office of Publications and Databases&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.srmhp.org/0302/anger.html|title=Nonspecific Factors and the Efficacy of Psychosocial Treatments for Anger|publisher=srmhp.org|date=2005|volume=3|number=2|author1=Bunmi O. Olatunji|author2=Jeffery M. Lohr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are specific types of anger management treatment approaches supported by empirical studies.  Several of the studies examined used [[self-report]], which some psychologists{{who|date=August 2015}} feel could be a limitation for results. People do not want others to think of them as angry individuals, so their answers could be changed to fit how society wants them to behave.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program ===

The Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP) is a program that was used in a study consisting of [[Air Force]] families.  The families were assigned to either a traditional multi-couple group format or a self-directed book version focusing on relationship satisfaction and anger management skills.  There was a significant main effect for time related to both relationship satisfaction (pretest M = 49.8, SD = 17.6; post-test M = 53.8, SD = 17.6, F(1, 76) = 6.91, p &lt; .01), and anger management skills, (pretest M = 32.2, SD = 4.2; post-test M = 34.6, SD = 4.0, F(1, 74) = 31.79, p &lt; .001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Anderson, J. R.|author2=Stith, S. M.|author3=Johnson, M. D.|author4=Strachman-Miller, M. M.|author5=Amanor-Boadu, Y.|author6=Linkh, D. J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2013|title=Multi-couple group and self-directed PREP formats enhance relationship satisfaction and improve anger management skills in Air Force couples|journal=American Journal of Family Therapy|volume=41|issue=2|pages=121–133|doi=10.1080/01926187.2012.671104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-directed book version did not show as positive of results. Improving a couple's anger management skills can be a vital step in ensuring there are no violent outbreaks throughout the relationship.

=== Cognitive behavioral therapy ===

The use of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is frequent in anger management treatment.  By trying to get a patient to open up about their emotions and feelings and being driven to accomplish a specific task (in this case controlling anger), a person is cognitively motivated to use positive skills towards their behavior.

Studies show using a mix of CBT as well as other therapies on the participants/clients increased the effective usage of the anger management techniques and that they also felt more in control of their own anger. Personal changes like these can lead to less aggression and fewer violent acts. The use of play therapy with this is also found efficient in tackling anger issues among children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lianalowenstein.com/anger_frey_edited.pdf|title=Creative Strategies for the Treatment of Anger|author=Diane E Frey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive mentalization and personal development ===

This is a style that is commonly used in elementary schools for students expressing anger outbursts.  Researchers who have looked into the reason for young student anger have found that one common reason could be the inability to adjust socially.  Students that were selected for this study received a daily one-hour session throughout one week of school.  The researchers of the [[mentalization]] program educated children through group therapy in [[positive psychology]] and tried to do activities that put the child in a happy mood while interacting.  At the end of the week, research showed that there was a negative correlation between anger and social adjustment.  This process lowered the overall anger levels of the students involved in social adjustment deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rohini, N. S.|author2=Devi, R.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=Management of anger and enhancement of social adjustment among school students with the application of positive therapy|journal=Indian Journal of Community Psychology|volume=7|issue=2|pp=249–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of [[personal development]] (PD) led to higher views of themselves and more positive [[self-esteem]].  Aggression has been shown to be a result of poor self-worth as well as thinking that those around us do not care or support us, so this PD is vital in helping change a person's [[self-perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Down, R.|author2=Willner, P.|author3=Watts, L.|author4=Griffiths, J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=Anger management groups for adolescents: A mixed-methods study of efficacy and treatment preferences|journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry|volume=16|issue=1|pages=33–52|doi=10.1177/1359104509341448|pmid=20223794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anger journaling ===
{{See also|Journal therapy|Writing therapy}}
Understanding one's own emotions can be a crucial piece of learning how to deal with anger.  Children who wrote down their negative emotions in an "anger diary" actually ended up improving their emotional understanding, which in turn led to less aggression.  When it comes to dealing with their emotions, children show the ability to learn best by seeing direct examples of instances that led to certain levels of anger. By seeing the reasons why they got angry, they can in the future try to avoid those actions or be prepared for the feeling they experience if they do find themselves doing something that typically results in them being angry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Renati, R.|author2=Cavioni, V.|author3=Zanetti, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title='Miss, I got mad today!' The Anger Diary, a tool to promote emotion regulation|journal=The International Journal of Emotional Education|volume=3|issue=1|pages=48–69|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303913674_Miss_I_got_mad_today_The_anger_diary_a_tool_to_promote_emotion_regulation_strategies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is not sufficient evidence of this needing to be implemented in elementary schools, but this activity is a common tool used in therapies, so it could lead to children writing down their negative feelings and anger and help them to re-evaluate their position and take personal time to cool down instead of lashing out and doing aggressive actions in person.

=== Other evidence-based approaches ===

Anger management interventions are based in cognitive behavioral techniques and follow in a three-step process.&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Beck, R.|author2=Fernandez, E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1998|title=Cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of anger: A meta-analysis|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=22|issue=1|pp=63–74|doi=10.1023/A:1018763902991}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the client learns to identify situations that can potentially trigger the feeling of anger. A situation that elicits anger is often referred to as an anger cue.&lt;ref name="Deffenbacher, L. J. 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Deffenbacher, L. J.|year=1999|title=Cognitive-behavioral conceptualization and treatment of anger|journal=Psychotherapy in Practice|volume=55|issue=3|pp=295–309|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(199903)55:3&lt;295::AID-JCLP3&gt;3.0.CO;2-A|pmid=10321745}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a potential trigger can be avoided, the individual can not only avoid unwanted outbursts, but also avoid internal conflict. Often anger occurs through automatic thought and irrational beliefs, these pose a problem for treatment because the patient may respond too quickly to change the thought or behavior. Wright, Day, &amp; Howells referred to this phenomenon as the "hijacking of the cognitive system by the emotional system".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wright, S.|author2=Day, A.|author3=Howells, K.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Mindfulness and the treatment of anger problems|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|volume=14|issue=5|pp=396–401|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2009.06.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Second, relaxation techniques are taught as appropriate responses to the identified situations. Common techniques include regulating breathing and physically removing themselves from the situation. Finally, [[role-play]] is used to practice the application of the learned techniques for future encounters with anger-inducing situations in the individual's life. The end result of repetition is an automatic response of learned beneficial techniques.&lt;ref name="Beck" /&gt; Modifications of each general step result in distinctive programs. Additionally, different fields of psychology will change aspects of the above three-step process, which is primarily based in cognitive-behavioral therapy. Group, family, and relaxation only therapies each contribute to the wider range of available anger management programs.

[[Relaxation therapy]] can reduce cognition and motivations to act out, and through relaxation, clients gain coping skills to better manage their anger. This therapy addresses various aspects of anger such as physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and social. These aspects combined are what make relaxation an effective treatment for anger.&lt;ref name="Deffenbacher, L. J. 1999"/&gt; The mindfulness therapy technique attempts to teach clients acceptance of bodily sensations and emotions. Mindfulness originated in Eastern spiritual traditions that are practiced through meditation. A two-prong component of mindfulness includes: self-regulation and orientation toward the present moment. The center of this therapy technique is experiencing the present moment in a non-judgmental manner that is reflective of meditation. In practice, clients observe breathing, sitting and walking during meditations. The goal is for clients to understand that his or her thoughts of anger are merely thoughts rather than reality. Mindfulness is also a technique used in the relaxation approach, because the technique halts physiological arousal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Rational emotive behavior therapy]] explains anger through the client's beliefs and emotion, rather than the event itself. The concept involves clients interpreting events in a rational manner in order to avoid irrational thoughts that lead to anger. Delayed reaction technique is when clients attempt to uncover what is making them angry before acting out on their anger. This allows them to have time to change what is making them angry and increase time before their response; this encourages thought on a more rational level. In addition, clients are also encouraged to avoid demands in an [[Anti-oppressive practice|anti-oppressive]] order to avoid anger.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Potts, L.|year=2008|title=Anger management|editor=L. Krueger|location=Farmington Hills, MI|publisher=Greenhaven Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a demand placed on a client may be that, "I have to have this done by my standards". Research is starting to show that the better individuals understand what anger management is and how it can help them personally and in relationships, aggressive actions are less likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freeanger.blogspot.com/|title=Free Anger|publisher=Free Anger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anger treatments' success rates can be difficult to estimate because excessive, severe anger is not a recognized disorder in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''. This manual is used as a reference for mental health professionals. Some research does exist on comparing various treatments for anger, but they also describe methodological difficulties in making accurate comparisons. The best practice for anger treatment is to use multiple techniques than a single technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kassinove, H.|year=2007|contribution=Finding a useful model for the treatment of anger and aggression|editor1=T. A. Cavell|editor2=K. T. Malcolm|title=Anger, Aggression, &amp; Interventions for Interpersonal Violence|pp=77–94|location=Mahwah, NJ|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relaxation approach had the highest success rate as a standalone treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mayne, J. T.|author2=Ambrose, K. T.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Research review on anger in psychotherapy|journal=Psychotherapy in Practice|volume=55|issue=3|pages=353–363|pmid=10321749|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(199903)55:3&lt;353::AID-JCLP7&gt;3.0.CO;2-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the CBT-based anger management therapies has been evaluated by a number of [[meta-analyses]]. In a 1998 meta-analysis with 50 studies and 1640 individuals, measures of anger and aggression were used to compare the effects of the anger management intervention with no treatment. A significant effect for anger management was found with a 67% chance of improvement for individuals having received the anger management as compared to the individuals without the therapy.&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt; In addition, a 2009 meta-analysis compared psychological treatments for anger across 96 studies. After an average of 8 sessions, a significant improvement in anger reduction resulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Saini, M.|year=2009|title=A meta-analysis of the psychological treatment of anger: Developing guidelines for evidence-based practice|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|volume=37|issue=4|pp=473–488|pmid=20018996|url=http://jaapl.org/content/37/4/473.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the completion of an anger management program is likely to result in long-lasting positive changes in behavior. Successful interventions can result in not only a reduction of the outward display of [[aggression]], but also a decrease in the internal level of anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=DiGiuseppe, R.|author2=Tafrate, R. C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|title=Anger Treatment for Adults: A Meta-Analytic Review. Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice|volume=10|issue=1|pp=70–84|doi= 10.1093/clipsy.10.1.70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medication ===
As anger is a psychological concern, treating with medication is a secondary line of approach. However, if there is a medical reason for an anger response certain psychotropic medications are prescribed by doctors to complement the psychotherapy intervention. Medications include Antidepressants, Anti-psychotics, Anti-seizure and Beta blockers. These drugs specifically do not target anger directly, but they have a calming outcome that can support control of rage and negative feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles H. Elliott|author2=Laura L. Smith|author3=W. Doyle Gentry|title=Anger Management For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idplCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA289|year=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-03000-3|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antidepressants may have a particular role when anger is a manifestation of depression. Anger attacks are found in 40% of those with [[major depressive disorder]] with 64–71% of cases responding to an [[SSRI]] such as [[fluoxetine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fava et al |first1=M |title=Fluoxetine treatment of anger attacks: a replication study |journal=Annals of Clinical Psychiatry |date=1996 |volume=8 |page=7-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Valerian (herb)|Valerian]] roots and [[saffron]] threads are herbal supplements that supposedly help in lowering stress and promotes calm feelings. Passionflower and chamomile are generally consumed in tea for supporting mood by reducing anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title= Anger management by medication | url= http://www.worldofchemicals.com/596/chemistry-articles/vital-role-of-chemistry-behind-anger.html  | publisher=''[[WorldOfChemicals]]''| date=Oct 17, 2017 |accessdate=October  20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affected populations==

===Adults===
One motivation for seeking anger management can be career related. As both a preventative and corrective tool, anger management is available to help individuals [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with potentially anger-inducing aspects of their jobs. One such situation applies to caretakers of individuals with [[mental illness]]. The daily stress combined with slow or no progress with the people under their care can create a high level of frustration. Skills training for caretakers of relatives with dementia has been developed to help cope with these feelings of frustration in a positive manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Coon, D.|author2=Thompson, L.|author3=Steffen, A.|author4=Sorocco, K.|author5=Gallagher-Thompson, D.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|title=Anger and depression management: Psychoeducational skill training interventions for women caregivers of a relative with dementia|journal=Gerontologist|volume=43|issue=5|pp= 678–689|pmid=14570964|url=http://gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/5/678.long|doi=10.1093/geront/43.5.678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anger management is also beneficial in [[law enforcement]]. The role of police officers is to protect civilians, however, conflicts between the police and the general public can develop. The goal of anger management would be to reduce such occurrences like police brutality from negatively impacting the relationship between law enforcement and citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Abernethy, A. D.|author2=Cox, C.|year=1994|lastauthoramp=y|title=Anger management training for law enforcement personnel|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|volume=22|issue=5|pp=459–466|doi=10.1016/0047-2352(94)90036-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anger management programs tailored towards this goal could orient themselves towards these means by focusing on [[conflict resolution]] and including specific law enforcement scenarios in the training. This need was noticed by Novaco, who originally designed an intervention for anger management based on cognitive behavioral therapy, resulting in a specialized skills training program for law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Novaco, R.|year=1977|title= Stress inoculation approach to anger management in training of law-enforcement officers|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|volume=5|issue=3|pp=327–346|pmid=910754|doi=10.1007/BF00884700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Couples also in the brink of dissolution of their marriage need to understand what to do about [[intimate partner violence]], and the more knowledgeable the individuals are on how to manage their anger, the better prepared they are when confronted with a problem with another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Shorey, R.

===Children and adolescents===
The ability for young children to understand their emotions and how to react in certain situations can greatly increase their chance of expressing themselves in an appropriate manner.  A 2010 study from the ''Journal of Applied School Psychology'' looked at four 4th grade boys who took part in different activities with the [[school psychologist]], ranging from how to deal with emotions to practicing anger reduction strategies. They found a positive correlation between partaking in these meetings and less anger expressing in a multitude of locations (school, home, etc.).&lt;ref name="Sportsman"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sportsman, E. L.|author2=Carlson, J. S.|author3=Guthrie, K. M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2010|title=Lesson learned from leading an anger management group using the "seeing red" curriculum within an elementary school|journal=Journal of Applied School Psychology|volume=26|issue=4|pp=339–350|doi=10.1080/15377903.2010.518823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anger management programs with a cognitive-behavioral basis have been modified for children and adolescents. There are three common types of CBT aimed at the youth. First, [[life skills]] development (communication, empathy, assertiveness, etc.) uses modeling to teach appropriate reactions to anger. Second, effective education focuses on identifying the feelings of anger and relaxation. Finally, problem solving conveys a view of cause and effect for situations as an alternative to anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=P.C Kendall|title=Cognitive-behavioral therapies with youth: Guiding theory, current status, and emerging developments|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=61|issue=2|year=1993|pp=235–247|pmid=8473577|doi=10.1037/0022-006X.61.2.235}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of methods can be used to convey these three components, with both age and severity being important factors. For younger children, involvement can be increased by presenting anger management in more of a fun format with educational games and activities being available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Plummer, D. M.|year=2008|title=Anger management games for children|location=London, GBR|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; For adolescents, group therapy can be an effective form given the resemblance to the individual's natural social environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Snyder, K. v.|author2=Kymissis, P.|author3=Kessler, K.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1999|title=Anger management for adolescents: Efficacy of brief group therapy|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=38|issue=11|pp= 1409–1416|pmid=10560228|doi=10.1097/00004583-199911000-00016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The severity of expressed anger issues often relates to the intensity of the subsequent anger management program. A few violent outbursts in a classroom setting could result in several sessions with the school's counselor. However, more severe [[juvenile delinquency]] could result in court-mandated anger management sessions in a juvenile correctional facility.

The effectiveness of anger management has been studied in children and adolescents for the purpose of evaluating existing programs and designing more effective programs. In a meta-analyses of 40 studies, an overall effect size of 0.67 was found for CBT anger management treatment, suggesting anger management as a legitimate approach to problematic levels of anger. Skills development (0.79) and problem solving (0.67) both had a higher impact than affective education (0.36). This was believed to be due to behavioral aspects being more easily conveyed than cognitive for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sukhodolsky, D.|author2=Kassinove, H.|author3=Gorman, B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2004|title=Cognitive-behavioral therapy for anger in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|volume= 9|issue=3|pp=247–269|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2003.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The true value from early interventions aimed at youths comes from the preventative aspect. Curbing negative behaviors early in life could lead to a more positive outlook as an adult.&lt;ref name=Candelaria&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Candelaria, A. M.|author2=Fedewa, A.

===Individuals with intellectual disabilities===
{{Main|Intellectual disabilities}}
Individuals with intellectual disabilities can struggle with managing anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kiely, J.|author2=Pankhurst, H.|title=Violence faced by staff in a learning disability service|journal=Disability and Rehabilitation|volume=20|issue=3|pp=81–89|year=1998|pmid=9548019|doi=10.3109/09638289809166060}}&lt;/ref&gt; When faced with aggression from individuals with an intellectual disability, caretakers often employ a combination of four different strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Taylor, J.|year=2002|title=A review of the assessment and treatment of anger and aggression in offenders with intellectual disability|journal=Journal of Intellectual Disability Research|volume=46|pp= 57–73|pmid=12031019|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2788.2002.00005.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on both the setting and individual, the following strategies for aggression minimization present in different ways.

# '''Reactive strategies''' – Aim to minimize impact of overtly aggressive behavior by using established protocols. Ex. Enforced isolation after the start of a violent outburst.
# '''Ecological interventions''' – Attempt to reduce aggression level by changing an aspect of the environment for a more calming effect. Ex. Reducing ambient noise to lower irritation.
# '''Contingency management''' – Focuses on modifying behavior through a combination of reinforcement and punishment. Ex. Using a token economy to enforce rules concerning behavior.
# '''Positive programming''' – Teaches positive reaction skills as an alternative to aggression. Ex. Anger management with a CBT background.

The need for anger management is also evident in situations where individuals with intellectual disabilities are prescribed psychotropic medication as the result of aggressive or self-injurious behavior. The medication's role as a chemical restraint does not help modify the underlying cause of aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Matson J. L.|author2=Bamburg J. W.|author3=Mayville E.

This is a group that a majority of the population might not associate with having AM problems, but research shows over half of the population of Americans with intellectual disabilities displays violent and aggressive actions somewhat regularly.  People with a [[learning disability]] tend to express anger and aggression to even those who help them on a daily basis.  Adults with intellectual disabilities are at high risk of acting aggressive and being sent to clinics due to their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Willner, P.|author2=Jahoda, A.|author3=Larkin, P.|year=2013|chapter=Management of anger in people with intellectual disabilities|editor=E.

The "[[theory of the mind]]" approach states that people with anger management problems tend to be unsteady mentally and are not able to internalize any blame for their actions. One of the main reasons for anger outbursts is externalizing blame and having a quick impulse to lash out.  These individuals need to have a better understanding of what their actions mean and that they should understand that blaming themselves for problems can sometimes be the right thing to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Josephs, L.|author2=McLeod, B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2014|title=A theory of mind–focused approach to anger management|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychology|volume=31|issue=1|pp=68–83|doi=10.1037/a0034175|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263922830_A_theory_of_mind-focused_approach_to_anger_management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violent criminals ===
{{Main|Violence}}
One study found that offenders who were currently in high-security hospitals that went through a self-report 20 class training program actually had very positive results.  Results of the self-report showed a decrease in aggression and a lack of responding when angry.  There were two issues to keep in mind though; a hospital setting and a setting in which the researchers did not want to provoke much anger due to the instability of the patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wilson, C.|author2=Gandolfi, S.|author3=Dudley, A.|author4=Thomas, B.|author5=Tapp, J.|author6=Moore, E. |lastauthoramp=y|year=2013|title=Evaluation of anger management groups in a high‐security hospital|journal=Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health|volume=23|issue=5|pp=356–371|doi=10.1002/cbm.1873|pmid=23881899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one meta-analysis study composed of studies completed from 1979 to 2010, school-aged children who were identified as having aggressive personalities were given several different anger management classes.  Overall, results showed slightly positive results for children receiving the classes (less aggression).  The courses aimed at reducing negative emotions in the children and trying to help them with [[self-control]].  While no overarching conclusions could be made, researchers state that children going through anger management courses are more prepared to combat their anger internally and less likely to act out.&lt;ref name=Candelaria/&gt;

=== Substance abusers ===
{{Main| Substance abuse}}
There is no statistical information that shows people who substance abuse also have high rates of aggressive actions.  However, researchers believe this is a group of people that should be studied due to their questionable decision-making and typically unstable mental health. Substance abusers could benefit from anger management to prevent potential aggression.

=== Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) individuals ===
{{Main|Posttraumatic stress disorder}}
This group can benefit from extended CBT dealing with anger management issues.  One study dealing with n= 86 war veterans found that during the 12 sessions of training, anger traits slightly dropped as well as small reductions in expressing anger. Research also indicates that their antisocial personality traits upon return can put them behind in society, so finding the right anger management courses is of vital importance.  There were not significant enough findings from this study to definitely recommend veterans with PTSD to use CBT anger management courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Marshall, A.

=== People with traumatic brain injuries ===
{{Main|Traumatic brain injury}}
People with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) can display impulsive, aggressive and dangerous actions.  A study in the ''[[Brain Injury (journal)|Brain Injury]]'' showed that one way to prevent such actions is a community-based treatment of people with TBI.  Results indicated that the need to lash out diminished after the 12-week program, and a series of post-treatment testing showed a decline in self-reported frequency of angry actions. Other specific results included: significant decreases in the frequency of experiencing angry feelings and the frequency of outward expression of anger as well as significant increases in the frequency of controlling feelings of anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Walker, A. J.|author2=Nott, M. T.|author3=Doyle, M.|author4=Onus, M.|author5=McCarthy, K.|author6=Baguley, I.

== Associated people ==

=== Seneca ===
{{Main|Seneca the Younger}}
One of the first people to study anger and the control of anger was the Roman philosopher Seneca.  He studied anger during his lifetime, c. 4 BC – AD 65, and from his experiences and observations he formulated ways to control anger.  This could be considered an early form of anger management. Seneca noted the importance of how to avoid becoming angry, how to quit being angry, and how to deal with anger in other people.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

Another theorist who came after Seneca was Galen, a Roman era philosopher, who built on the work of Seneca to formulate new ideas in the area of anger management.  Galen stresses the importance of a mentor to help deal with excess anger.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Peter Stearns ===
{{Main|Peter Stearns}}
Peter Stearns played an important part in researching the differences in anger between genders. Stearns concluded that there are similarities between male and females experience of anger. June Crawford came up with an opposing idea about how the two genders deal with anger. Her research concluded that men and women deal with anger by different means.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Raymond Novaco ===
Works from Raymond Novaco in the 1970s have contributed to many of the recent ideas on the management of anger. These ideas have led to the implementation of different anger management programs. Novaco stressed the importance of looking at the situations that led up to the anger in order to have control over the anger. He stated that anger is an emotional response to situations, and that anger occurs in three modalities, either cognitive, somaticaffective or behavioral.  After discovering the anger, there should be discussion and self-examination in order to relieve the anger. This process was thought to help the client identify the situations that lead to anger and deal with the anger depending on the step that the anger is occurring in. The client is able to use different relaxation skills to reduce their anger before it advances.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Benefits==
The benefits of undergoing anger management brings around the successful reduction in anger and violent outbursts. Personal relationships that have been previously strained by a high level of aggression may undergo improvement. Professionally, workplace relationships have a similar outcome that are beneficial to an individual's career and personal sense of satisfaction. Legally, continued attendance to anger management programs, mandated or not, can be seen as a sign of good faith. For incarcerated individuals, an earlier parole time can be the result of good behavior learned from anger management classes. From an emotional standpoint, reducing the internal level of anger results in a decrease in stress and an increase in overall happiness as a result.

From a medical standpoint, physical illnesses also improve from positive emotional and behavioral changes. Anger management style and overall level of anger has been associated with both acute and chronic pain sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Burns, J.|author2=Bruehl, S.|author3=Caceres, C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2004|title=Anger management style, blood pressure reactivity, and acute pain sensitivity: Evidence for "trait X situation" models|journal=Annals of Behavioral Medicine|volume=27|issue=3|pp=195–204|pmid=15184095|doi=10.1207/s15324796abm2703_7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blood pressure]] is another physiological aspect effected by anger, with increased levels of anger being correlated with higher blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Faber, S.|author2=Burns, J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1996|title=Anger management style, degree of expressed anger, and gender influence cardiovascular recovery from interpersonal harassment|journal=Journal of Behavioral Medicine|volume=19|issue=1|pp=31–53|pmid=8932660|doi=10.1007/BF01858173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of an effect on blood pressure for overall health is made evident by the link between high blood pressure and the increased risk of [[cardiovascular disease]]. An increase in the immune system's efficacy has also been observed as a result of the increased level of relaxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Weber, C.|author2=Arck, P.|author3=Mazurek, B.|author4=Klapp, B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|title=Impact of a relaxation training on psychometric and immunologic parameters in tinnitus sufferers|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|volume=52|issue=1|pp=29–33|pmid=11801262|doi=10.1016/S0022-3999(01)00281-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful anger management could also lead to an overall longer life span due to the decrease in reckless behavior and violent altercations.

==Impediments==
There are a number of factors that can lower the probability of a successful anger management intervention. One such obstacle is the level of the individual's [[motivation]]. Overall low readiness is an impediment to the effectiveness of anger management due to the lower attendance rates and negative effect on the [[therapeutic alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Howells, K.|author2=Day, A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|title=Readiness for anger management: Clinical and theoretical issues|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=23|issue=2|pp=319–337|pmid=12573674|doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(02)00228-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Involuntary assignment to an anger management program, for example court mandated sessions, will result in a lower average motivation level than voluntary admission. In one study with incarcerated inmates, there was a correlation found between individual readiness and improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heseltine, K.|year=2010|title=Brief anger interventions with offenders may be ineffective: A replication and extension|type=report|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|volume=48|issue=3|p=246|pmid=19896643|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2009.10.005|url=http://www.hsjcc.on.ca/Resource%20Library/Forensic%20Clinical/Brief%20anger%20interventions%20with%20offenders%20may%20be%20ineffective%20-%202010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, given the component of anger as a [[social construct]], difficulty with communication between cultures can serve as another impediment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.R. Averill|year=1993|contribution=Putting the social in social cognition, with special reference to emotion|editor1=R.S. Wyer|editor2=T.K. Srull|title=Perspectives on anger and emotion: advances in social cognition|volume=VI|pp=47–56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-2aYAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|isbn=9780805813272|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is deemed an appropriate expression of anger is culturally dependent. Therefore, a mismatch between client and therapist could result in a misunderstanding as to the end goal of the program. For example, a client could only wish to decrease physical violence, while the therapist aims to decrease both verbal and physical outbursts. Gender-dependent expectations of anger expression can contribute as well to societal standards. The same [[Violence|violent]] outburst for a man and woman is subject to different interpretations due to anger being seen as more permissible in males.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

The cost of taking anger management could also be a significant obstacle if the person does not have health insurance.  The time required for anger management depends on the program. Weekly one-hour sessions with eight to 12 sessions per program are common, but a single intensive all-day session variety exists as well. The monetary cost can amount to $90–$120 per session for general therapy, or much higher fees for specialized coaching. The availability of anger management programs locally can be problematic for more isolated areas, creating an additional cost for travel. However, online options can follow the same structure as an in-person intervention with similar outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Morland, L. A.|author2=Greene, C. J.|author3=Rosen, C.

An '''associative entity''' is a term used in [[relational model| relational]] and [[entity–relationship model|entity–relationship]] theory. A relational database requires the implementation of a base relation (or base table) to resolve [[Many-to-many (data model)|many-to-many relationships]]. A base relation representing this kind of entity is called, informally, an '''associative table'''.  [[Image:Associate_Entity.png|frame|An associative entity (using [[Peter Chen|Chen]] notation)]]

As mentioned above, associative entities are implemented in a database structure using associative tables, which are tables that can contain references to columns from the same or different database tables within the same database.

[[File:mapping_table_concept.png|right|Concept of a mapping table]]
An associative (or junction) table maps two or more tables together by referencing the primary keys of each data table. In effect, it contains a number of foreign keys, each in a many-to-one relationship from the junction table to the individual data tables. The PK of the associative table is typically composed of the FK columns themselves.

Associative tables are colloquially known under many names, including '''association table''', '''bridge table''', '''cross-reference table''', '''crosswalk''', '''intermediary table''', '''intersection table''', '''join table''', '''junction table''', '''link table''', '''linking table''', '''many-to-many resolver''', '''map table''', '''mapping table''', '''pairing table''', '''pivot table''' (as used incorrectly in [[Laravel]] - not to be confused with the correct use of [[pivot table | pivot table in spreadsheets]]), or  '''transition table'''.

==Using associative tables==

An example of the practical use of an associative table would be to assign permissions to users. There can be multiple users, and each user can be assigned zero or more permissions.  Individual permissions may be granted to one or more users. 

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserLogin varchar(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    UserPassword varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    UserName varchar(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Permissions (
    PermissionKey varchar(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    PermissionDescription varchar(500) NOT NULL
);

-- This is the junction table.
CREATE TABLE UserPermissions (
    UserLogin varchar(50) REFERENCES Users (UserLogin),
    PermissionKey varchar(50) REFERENCES Permissions (PermissionKey),
    PRIMARY KEY (UserLogin, PermissionKey)
);
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Junction Table.svg|center|A visual depiction of the table schema described, with relationships indicated]]
{{-}}

A [[Select (SQL)|SELECT]]-statement on a junction table usually involves [[Join (SQL)|joining]] the main table with the junction table:
&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT * FROM Users
JOIN UserPermissions USING (UserLogin);
&lt;/source&gt;

This will return a list of all users and their permissions.

[[Insert (SQL)|Inserting]] into a junction table involves multiple steps: first inserting into the main table(s), then updating the junction table.

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
-- Creating a new User
INSERT INTO Users (UserLogin, UserPassword, UserName)
VALUES ('SomeUser', 'SecretPassword', 'UserName');

-- Creating a new Permission
INSERT INTO Permissions (PermissionKey, PermissionDescription)
VALUES ('TheKey', 'A key used for several permissions');

-- Finally, updating the junction
INSERT INTO UserPermissions (UserLogin, PermissionKey)
VALUES ('SomeUser', 'TheKey');
&lt;/source&gt;

Using foreign keys, the database will automatically dereference the values of the UserPermissions table to their own tables.

'''''Āyatana''''' ([[Pāli]]; [[Sanskrit]]: आयतन) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term that has been translated as "sense base", "sense-media" or "sense sphere."&lt;ref&gt;"Sense base" is used for instance by Bodhi (2000b) and Soma (1999).  "Sense-media" is used by Thanissaro (e.g., cf. [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.149.than.html Thanissaro, 1998c]).  "Sense sphere" is used for instance by VRI (1996) and suggested by [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:2840.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–5), p. 105], whose third definition for ''Āyatana'' is: 
:sphere of perception or sense in general, object of thought, sense-organ &amp; object; relation, order. – [Aung &amp; Rhys Davids (1910),] p. 183 says rightly: 'āyatana cannot be rendered by a single English word to cover both sense-organs (the mind being regarded as 6th sense) and sense objects'. – These āyatanāni (relations, functions, reciprocalities) are thus divided into two groups, inner (ajjhattikāni) and outer (bāhirāni)....&lt;/ref&gt;  In Buddhism, there are six ''internal'' sense bases (Pali: ''ajjhattikāni āyatanāni''; also known as, "organs", "gates", "doors", "powers" or "roots"&lt;ref name="pine102"&gt;Pine 2004, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;) and six ''external'' sense bases (''bāhirāni āyatanāni'' or "sense objects"; also known as ''vishaya'' or "domains"&lt;ref name="pine103"&gt;Pine 2004, pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt;). Thus, there are six internal-external (organ-object) pairs of sense bases:&lt;ref&gt;One may ''logically'' deduce from the existence of six internal sense bases and six external sense bases that there are a total of twelve ''individual'' sense bases; the Pali canon, however, never references "twelve" sense bases per se, e.g., see MN 137: ''"[S]a{{IAST|ḷ}}āyatanavibhaṅgaṃ vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi.... Cha  ajjhattikāni āyatanāni veditabbāni, cha bāhirāni āyatanāni veditabbāni...."''  Also see MN 148, 149, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

:* eye and [[rupa (Buddhism)|visible objects]]&lt;ref&gt;The Pāli word translated here as "visible objects" is ''[[rūpa]]''. In terms of the Buddhist notion of the sense bases, rūpa refers to ''visual'' objects (or objects knowable by the eye through light).  This should not be confused with the use of the word rūpa in terms of the Buddhist notion of [[skandha|aggregates]] where rūpa refers to ''all'' material objects, both of the world and the body.  Thus, when comparing these two uses of rūpa, the rūpa aggregate (''rūpakkhandha'') includes the rūpa sense-object (''rūpāyatana'') as well as the four other material sense-objects (sound, odor, taste and touch).&lt;/ref&gt;
:* ear and sound
:* nose and odor
:* tongue and taste
:* body and touch
:* mind&lt;ref name="mano"&gt;The Pāli word translated here as "mind" is ''mano''.  Other common translations include "intellect" [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html (e.g., Thanissaro, 2001a)] and "consciousness" [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.010.soma.html (e.g., Soma, 1999).]  In the [[Suttapitaka]], ''mano'' does not necessarily refer to all mental processing.  Other oft-mentioned complementary mental processes include "consciousness" (''[[viññāṇa]]'') and "mental states" (''citta'').  Nonetheless, in the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]] and later texts, these terms are at times used synonymously.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dharma (Buddhism)|mental objects]]&lt;ref&gt;The Pāli word translated here as "mental objects" is ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|dhammā]]''.  Other frequently seen translations include "mental phenomena" (e.g., Bodhi, 2000b, pp. 1135''ff''.), "thoughts," "ideas" [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html (e.g., Thanissaro, 2001a)] and "contents of the mind"  (VRI, 1996, p. 39) while some translators simply leave this word untranslated due to its complex overtones in the [[Pali literature]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism and other Indian epistemologies&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (2001), p. 53, writes: "... six senses, including one relating to non-sensory mental activity, are recognized in Buddhism and other Indian schools of thought...."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pine101"&gt;See also Pine 2004, pg. 101.  Red Pine argues that this scheme probably predates Buddhism, because it has ten external members (ear, sound, nose, odor, tongue, taste, body, touch) corresponding to the single external skandha (form), and only two internal members (mind and thought) corresponding to the four internal skandhas.&lt;/ref&gt; identify six "senses" as opposed to the Western identification of five. In Buddhism, "mind" denotes an internal sense organ which interacts with sense objects that include [[phassa|sense impressions]], [[vedana|feelings]], [[sañña|perceptions]] and [[Saṅkhāra|volition]].&lt;ref name="mano" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Bodhi (2000a), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{IAST|Saḷāyatana}}''''' (Pāli; Skt. '''''[[Sadayatana|{{IAST|ṣaḍāyatana}}]]''''') refers to all six sense objects and six sense organs and is generally used in the context of the [[Twelve Nidanas|Twelve Causes (''nidāna'')]] of the chain of [[Pratitya-Samutpada|Dependent Origination]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3909.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–5), p. 699.]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Pali Canon==
In the [[Four Noble Truths]], [[the Buddha]] identifies that the origin of suffering (Pali, Skt.: ''[[dukkha]]'') is craving (Pali: ''[[Tanha|{{IAST|taṇhā}}]]''; Skt.: ''{{IAST|tṛṣṇā}}'').  In the chain of [[Twelve Nidanas|Dependent Origination]], the Buddha identifies that craving arises from [[Vedana|sensations]] that result from [[Sparśa|contact]] at the six sense bases.  (See Figure 2 below.)  Therefore, to overcome craving and its resultant suffering, one should develop restraint of and insight into the sense bases.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005b), starting at time 50:00. Bodhi (2005b) references, for instance, [[Majjhima Nikaya]] Sutta No. 149, where the Buddha instructs:
:"...[K]nowing &amp; seeing the eye as it actually is present, knowing &amp; seeing [visible] forms... consciousness at the eye... contact at the eye as they actually are present, knowing &amp; seeing whatever arises conditioned through contact at the eye – experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain – as it actually is present, one is not infatuated with the eye... forms... consciousness at the eye... contact at the eye... whatever arises.... The craving that makes for further becoming – accompanied by passion &amp; delight, relishing now this &amp; now that – is abandoned by him. His bodily disturbances &amp; mental disturbances are abandoned. His bodily torments &amp; mental torments are abandoned. His bodily distresses &amp; mental distresses are abandoned. He is sensitive both to ease of body &amp; ease of awareness..." [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.149.than.html (Thanissaro, 1998c).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, reference to the [[Four Noble Truths]] in this context is redundant as the whole endless cycle of the [[Twelve Nidanas|Twelve Causes]] is a form of [[dukkha|suffering]] and the last two causes, [[Jati (Buddhism)|Birth]] and [[Jaramarana|Old Age &amp; Death]], are ''explicitly'' identified as components of suffering by the Buddha in the Four Noble Truths (for instance, see the [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|Dhammacakka Sutta]]).  Nonetheless, Bodhi's formulation here provides a conciseness – both conceptually and, in this diagram, visually – that might otherwise not be as compelling and readily comprehended.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Throughout the [[Pali Canon]], the sense bases are referenced in hundreds of discourses.&lt;ref&gt;The greatest concentration of discourses related to the sense bases is in the [[Samyutta Nikaya]], chapter 35, entitled "The Book of the Six Sense Bases" (''{{IAST|Saḷāyatana-vagga}}'').  For instance, in Bodhi (2000b) edition of the Samyutta Nikaya, this chapter alone has 248 discourses.  The Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25) entry for [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:2840.pali "Āyatana" (p. 105)] also mentions other discourses in each of the Pali nikayas.&lt;/ref&gt;  In these diverse discourses, the sense bases are contextualized in different ways including:

* '''Sextets''' (Pali: ''chakka''):&lt;br&gt;The sense bases include two sets of six: six sense organs (or internal sense bases) and six sense objects (or external sense bases).  Based on these six pairs of sense bases, a number of mental factors arise.  Thus, for instance, when an ear and sound are present, the associated consciousness (Pali: ''[[Vijñāna|{{IAST|viññāṇa}}]]'') arises.  The arising of these three elements (''dhātu'') – ear, sound and ear-related consciousness – lead to what is known as "contact" (''[[phassa]]'') which in turn causes a pleasant or unpleasant or neutral "feeling" or "sensation" (''[[vedanā]]'') to arise.  It is from such a feeling that "craving" (''{{IAST|[[taṇhā]]}}'') arises.  (See Figure 1.)  Such an enumeration can be found, for instance, in the "Six Sextets" discourse (''Chachakka Sutta'', [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 148), where the "six sextets" (six sense organs, six sense objects, six sense-specific types of consciousness, six sense-specific types of contact, six sense-specific types of sensation and six sense-specific types of craving) are examined and found to be [[anatta|empty of self]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}} &amp; Bodhi (2001), pp. 1129–36; and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.148.than.html Thanissaro (1998a).]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''"The All"''' (Pali: ''sabba''):&lt;br&gt;In a discourse entitled, "The All" ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.23), the Buddha states that there is no "all" outside of the six pairs of sense bases.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), p. 1140; and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html  Thanissaro (2001b).] According to Bodhi (2000b), p. 1399, ''n''. 7, the Pali commentary regarding the ''Sabba Sutta'' states: "...[I]f one passes over the twelve sense bases, one cannot point out any real phenomenon."  Also see [https://archive.is/20120707171513/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3261.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25), p. 680, "Sabba" entry] where ''{{IAST|sabbaŋ}}'' is defined as "the (whole) world of sense-experience."&lt;/ref&gt;  In the next codified discourse (SN 35.24), the Buddha elaborates that the All includes the first five aforementioned sextets (sense organs, objects, consciousness, contact and sensations).&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), p. 1140; and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.024.than.html Thanissaro (2001a).]&lt;/ref&gt; References to the All can be found in a number of subsequent discourses.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.25 through 35.29, including the famed "Fire Sermon" (SN 35.28).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the [[Abhidhamma]] and post-canonical Pali literature further conceptualize the sense bases as a means for classifying ''all'' factors of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), p. 1122.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Twelve Nidanas|The Twelve Causes]]''' (Pali, Skt.: ''nidāna''):&lt;br&gt;As described in the [[#Related Buddhist concepts|"Related Buddhist concepts"]] section below and illustrated in Figure 2, the sense bases are a critical link in the endless round of rebirth known as the Twelve Causes and as depicted in the [[Bhavacakra|Wheel of Becoming]] (Skt.: ''bhavacakra'').&lt;ref&gt;Note that the Twelve Causes and Six Sextets describe the relationship between the sense bases and consciousness in different ways.  Relatedly, there are canonical discouses that put forth hybrid models of these various psychophysical factors, such as described in "The World Discourse" (''Loka Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.44) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.044.than.html (Thanissaro, 1998b;] and, Bodhi, 2005a, pp.&amp;nbsp;358–59) where the aforementioned six "sextets" (from the eye and form to craving) condition the last four "causes" (clinging, becoming, birth, old age &amp; death) and suffering.  In reference to this and similar "variant" discourses, Bodhi (2005a) notes:
:"These variants make it plain that the sequence of factors should not be regarded as a linear causal process in which each preceding factor gives rise to its successor through the simple exercise of efficient causality. Far from being linear, the relationship among the factors is always complex, involving several interwoven strands of conditionality." (Bodhi, 2005a, p. 316.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Aflame with lust, hate and delusion" ===

In "The Vipers" discourse (''Asivisa Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.197), [[the Buddha]] likens the internal sense bases to an "empty village" and the external sense bases to "village-plundering bandits."  Using this metaphor, the Buddha characterizes the "empty"&lt;ref&gt;In the context of SN 35.197, the term "empty" might simply be meant to convey "passive."  It could also be used in the Buddhist sense of self-less, as in ''[[anatta]]'' (''see''). In fact, in [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.85, the Buddha applies this latter notion of emptiness (''[[Shunyata|suññata]]'') to all internal ''and'' external sense bases (Bodhi, 2000b, pp. 1163–64; and  [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.085.than.html Thanissaro, 1997c)].&lt;/ref&gt; sense organs as being "attacked by agreeable &amp; disagreeable" sense objects.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), pp. 1237–1239 (where this discourse is identified as SN 35.238); Buddhaghosa (1999), p. 490 (where this discourse is identified as S.iv,175); and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.197.than.html Thanissaro (2004)].

Similarly, in the last sutta of the Samyutta Nikaya's ''Salayatana-samyutta'', entitled "The Sheaf of Barley" (which Bodhi, 2000b, identifies as SN 35.248 and Thanissaro, 1998d, as SN 35.207), the Buddha describes the sense organs as "struck" or "thrashed" by "agreeable and disagreeable" sense objects (Bodhi, 2000b, pp. 1257–59; [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.207.than.html Thanissaro, 1998d]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in the same collection of discourses ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.191), the Buddha's Great [[Sravaka|Disciple]] [[Sariputta]] clarifies that the actual [[dukkha|suffering]] associated with sense organs and sense objects is not ''inherent'' to these sense bases but is due to the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|"fetters"]] (here identified as "desire and lust") that arise when there is contact between a sense organ and sense object.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), pp. 1230–1231 (where this discourse is identified as SN 35.232); and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.191.than.html Thanissaro (1997b)].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "[[Fire Sermon]]" (''Adittapariyaya Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.28), delivered several months after the Buddha's [[bodhi|awakening]], the Buddha describes all sense bases and related mental processes in the following manner:
:"Monks, the All is aflame. What All is aflame? The eye is aflame. [[Rupa (Buddhism)|Forms]] are aflame. [[Vinnana|Consciousness]] at the eye is aflame. [[Phassa|Contact]] at the eye is aflame. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye – experienced as [[Vedana|pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain]] – that too is aflame. Aflame with what? Aflame with the fire of [[Kilesa|passion]], the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. Aflame, I tell you, with [[Dukkha|birth, aging &amp; death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, &amp; despairs]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.028.than.html Thanissaro, 1993.]  For other references to the sense bases as "the All," see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html Thanissaro (2001b)] and [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.024.than.html Thanissaro (2001a).]  The sense bases are "the All" insomuch that all we know of the world is known through the sense bases.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extinguishing suffering's flame ===

The Buddha taught that, in order to escape the dangers of the sense bases, one must be able to apprehend the sense bases without [[kilesa|defilement]].  In "Abandoning the Fetters" ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.54), the Buddha states that one abandons the fetters "when one knows and sees ... as [[impermanence|impermanent]]" (Pali: ''anicca'') the six sense organs, objects, sense-[[vinnana|consciousness]], [[Sparśa|contact]] and [[Vedana|sensations]].&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), p. 1148.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in "Uprooting the Fetters" (SN 35.55), the Buddha states that one uproots the fetters "when one knows and sees ... as [[Anatta|nonself]]" (''anatta'') the aforementioned five sextets.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), p. 1148. For a correspondence between impermanence and nonself, see [[Three marks of existence]].&lt;/ref&gt;

To foster this type of penetrative knowing and seeing and the resultant release from suffering, in the [[Satipatthana Sutta]] ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 10)  the Buddha instructs monks to meditate on the sense bases and the dependently arising fetters as follows:
:"How, O [[bhikkhus]], does a bhikkhu live contemplating mental object in the mental objects of the six internal and the six external sense-bases?
:"Here, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands the eye and material forms and the fetter that arises dependent on both (eye and forms); he understands how the arising of the non-arisen fetter comes to be; he understands how the abandoning of the arisen fetter comes to be; and he understands how the non-arising in the future of the abandoned fetter comes to be. [''In a similar manner:''] He understands the ear and sounds ... the organ of smell and odors ... the organ of taste and flavors ... the organ of touch and tactual objects ... the consciousness and mental objects....
:"Thus he lives contemplating mental object in mental objects ... and [[upadana|clings]] to naught in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.010.soma.html Soma (1999)], section entitled, "The Six Internal and the Six External Sense-bases."&lt;/ref&gt;

==In post-canonical Pali texts==
The ''[[Vimuttimagga]]'', the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', and associated [[Atthakatha|Pali commentaries]]&lt;ref&gt;In terms of the Pali commentaries, for instance, there is overlap between the Visuddhimagga and the commentary to the [[Dhammasangani]], ''Atthasālinī'' (e.g., cf. Vsm. XIV,49 [Buddhaghosa, 1999, p. 446] and Asl. 310 [Rhys Davids, 1900, p. 178 n. 2]).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|subcommentaries]] all contribute to traditional knowledge about the sense bases.

===Understanding sense organs===

When the Buddha speaks of "understanding" the eye, ear, nose, tongue and body, what is meant?

According to the first-century CE Sinhalese meditation manual, ''Vimuttimagga'', the sense organs can be understood in terms of the object sensed, the consciousness aroused, the underlying "sensory matter," and an associated [[mahabhuta|primary or derived element]] that is present "in excess."&lt;ref&gt;In regards to defining the sense bases in terms of excess primary elements, the Visuddhimagga (Vsm. XIV, 42) is critical:
:"... Others say that the eye is sensitivity of those [primary elements] that have fire in excess, and that the ear, nose, tongue, and body are [sensitivity] of those [primary elements] that have [respectively] aperture, air, water and earth in excess.  They should be asked to quote a sutta.  They will certainly not find one." (Buddhaghosa, 1999, p. 444, para. 42.)&lt;/ref&gt;  These characteristics are summarized in the table below.

The compendious fifth-century CE ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' provides similar descriptors, such as "the size of a mere louse's head" for the location of the eye's "sensitivity" (Pali: ''pasāda''; also known as, "sentient organ, sense agency, sensitive surface"),&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25), p. 446, entry for "Pasāda" (retrieved 2008-04-16 from "U. Chicago" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:2481.pali).&lt;/ref&gt; and "in the place shaped like a goat's hoof" regarding the nose sensitivity ([[Visuddhimagga|Vsm]]. XIV, 47–52).&lt;ref&gt;Buddhaghosa (1999), pp. 445–6.  While this Visuddhimagga chapter (XIV) actually pertains to the [[Skandha|Five Aggregates]], this characterization is referenced in the Visuddhimagga chapter (XV) on the Sense Bases (Buddhaghosa, 1999, p. 489, verse 8).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the Visuddhimagga describes the sense organs in terms of the following four factors:
:* characteristic or sign (''lakkha{{IAST|ṇ}}a'')
:* function or "taste" (''rasa'')
:* manifestation (''paccupa{{IAST|ṭṭ}}hāna'')
:* proximate cause (''pada{{IAST|ṭṭ}}hāna'')
Thus, for instance, it describes the eye as follows:
:Herein, the eye's characteristic is sensitivity of [[mahabhuta|primary elements]] that is ready for the impact of visible data; or its characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements originated by [[Karma|kamma]] sourcing from desire to see.  Its function is to pick up [an object] among visible data.  It is manifested as the footing of eye-[[vijnana|consciousness]].  Its proximate cause is primary elements born of kamma sourcing from desire to see.&lt;ref&gt;Vsm. XIV, 37 (trans. Buddhaghosa, 1999, p. 443; square-bracketed text in original).  The Pali (from the Burmese CSCD, retrieved 2008-04-16 from "VRI" at http://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/e0102n.mul2.xml) associated with this passage is:
:{{IAST|Tattha rūpābhighātārahatappasādalakkhaṇaṃ daṭṭhukāmatānidānakammasamuṭṭhānabhūtappasādalakkhaṇaṃ vā cakkhu, rūpesu āviñchanarasaṃ, cakkhuviññāṇassa ādhārabhāvapaccupaṭṭhānaṃ, daṭṭhukāmatānidānakammajabhūtapadaṭṭhānaṃ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the sixth internal sense base of mind (''mano''), Pali [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|subcommentaries]] (attributed to Dhammapāla Thera) distinguish between consciousness arising from the five physical sense bases and that arising from the primarily post-[[Pali Canon|canonical]] notion of a "life-continuum" or "unconscious mind" (''bhava{{IAST|ṅ}}ga-mana''):&lt;ref&gt;Regarding ''bhava{{IAST|ṅ}}ga'' being a primarily post-canonical concept, see Matthews (1995, p. 128) where he states for instance: "''Bhava{{IAST|ṅ}}ga'' does not occur in the [[Sutta Pitaka]], but its appearance in both the ''[[Dhammasangani|Dhammasa{{IAST|ṅ}}ga{{IAST|ṇ}}i]]'' and the ''[[Patthana|Pa{{IAST|ṭṭ}}hāna]]'' assured that it received much post-classical attention in the Theravāda." He further amplifies this in an endnote (p. 140, ''n''. 34): "... [A]lthough ''bhava{{IAST|ṅ}}ga'' does appear in the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka|Abhidhamma Pi{{IAST|ṭ}}aka]], it is not until the post-classical era that it receives much attention." Citing Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli and others, Matthews (1995, p. 123) defines the "classical age" as "ended about the 4th century A.D.," just prior to the "great age of [[Atthakatha|commentaries]]."&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Of the consciousness or mind aggregate included in a course of cognition of eye-consciousness, just the eye-base [not the mind-base] is the 'door' of origin, and the [external sense] base of the material form is the visible object.  So it is in the case of the others [that is, the ear, nose, tongue and body sense bases].  But of the sixth sense-base the part of the mind base called the life-continuum, the unconscious mind, is the 'door' of origin...."&lt;ref&gt;Soma (2003), p. 133.  This excerpt is from the subcommentary to the [[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhima Nikāya]], the ''Līnatthapakāsanā Tīkā''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The roots of wisdom===
In the fifth-century CE exegetical ''Visuddhimagga'', [[Buddhaghosa]] identifies knowing about the sense bases as part of the "soil" of liberating [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]].  Other components of this "soil" include the [[skandha|aggregates]], the [[indriya|faculties]], the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Dependent Origination]].&lt;ref&gt;Buddhaghosa &amp; Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli (1999), pp. 442–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related Buddhist concepts==

*'''[[Skandha|Aggregates]]''' (Pali, ''khandha''; Skt., ''skandha''):&lt;br&gt;In a variety of suttas, the aggregates, elements (''see below'') and sense bases are identified as the "soil" in which [[tanha|craving]] and [[upadana|clinging]] grow.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.91 where the Buddha proclaims:
:"Whatever, [[bhikkhu]]s, is the extent of the aggregates, the elements, and the sense bases, [a right-practicing monk] does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive, 'This is mine.' Since he does not conceive anything thus, he does not cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, he is not agitated.  Being unagitated, he personally attains [[Nirvana (concept)|Nibbāna]]..." (Bodhi, 2000b, p. 1171).&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, in the [[Pali Canon]], the aggregate of material form includes the five material sense organs (eye, ear, nose, tongue and body) and associated sense objects (visible forms, sounds, odors, tastes and tactile objects); the aggregate of consciousness is associated with the sense organ of mind; and, the mental aggregates (sensation, perception, mental formations) are mental sense objects.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Bodhi (2000b), pp. 1122–24. Beyond the five aggregates, ''[[Nibbana]]'' is also identified as a "mental object" perceivable by "mind" (''mano'') (see, for instance, Bodhi, 2000a, p. 288).&lt;/ref&gt;    &lt;br&gt;Both the aggregates and the sense bases are identified as objects of [[Sati (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] in the [[Satipatthana Sutta]]. In terms of pursuing liberation, meditating on the aggregates eradicates self-doctrine and wrong-view [[upadana|clinging]] while meditating on the sense bases eradicates sense-pleasure clinging.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Bodhi (2000b), pp. 1124–26; and, Bodhi (2005b), starting at time 48:47.  Also see the article on ''[[upadana]]'' for the [[Pali Canon|canonical]] explanation of the four types of clinging: sense-pleasure, wrong-view, rites-and-rituals and self-doctrine.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Pratitya-samutpada|Dependent Origination]]''' (Pali: ''{{IAST|paṭicca-samuppāda}}''; Skt.: ''pratitya-samutpada''):&lt;br&gt;As indicated in Figure 2 above, the six sense bases (Pali: ''{{IAST|saḷāyatana}}''; Skt.: ''{{IAST|ṣaḍāyatana}}'') are the fifth link in the [[Twelve Nidanas|Twelve Causes]] (''nidāna'') of the chain of Dependent Origination and thus likewise are the fifth position on the [[Bhavacakra|Wheel of Becoming]] (''bhavacakra''). The arising of the six sense bases is dependent on the arising of [[namarupa|material and mental objects]] (Pali, Skt.: ''nāmarūpa''); and, the arising of the six sense bases leads to the arising of "[[Sparśa|contact]]" (Pali: ''phassa''; Skt.: ''sparśa'') between the sense bases and [[Vijnana|consciousness]] (Pali: ''{{IAST|viññāṇa}}''; Skt.: ''visjñāna'') which results in pleasant, unpleasant and neutral [[vedana|feelings]] (Pali, Skt.: ''vedanā'').
*'''Elements''' (Pali, Skt.: ''dhātu''):&lt;ref&gt;The Pāli word referenced here as "element," ''dhātu'', is used in multiple contexts in the [[Pali canon|Pāli canon]]. For instance, Bodhi (2000b), pp. 527–8, identifies four different ways that ''dhātu'' is used including in terms of the "eighteen elements" and in terms of "the four primary elements" (''[[mahabhuta|catudhātu]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;The eighteen elements include the twelve sense bases. The eighteen elements are six triads of elements where each triad is composed of a sense object (the external sense bases), a sense organ (the internal sense bases) and the associated sense-organ-consciousness (''{{IAST|viññāṇa}}'').&lt;ref&gt;In Buddhist literature, when a sense object and sense organ make contact (Pali, ''phassa''), sense-consciousness arises.  (See for instance [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 148.)&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, the eighteen elements are made up of the twelve sense bases and the six related sense-consciousnesses.
*'''[[Karma in Buddhism|Karma]]''' (Skt.; Pali: ''kamma''):&lt;br&gt;In a [[Samyutta Nikaya]] discourse, the Buddha declares that the six internal senses bases (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind) are "old kamma, to be seen as generated and fashioned by volition, as something to be felt."&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005b), pp. 1211–12.  See also [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.145.than.html Thanissaro (1997a).]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this discourse, "new kamma" is described as "whatever action one does now by body, speech, or mind."  In this way, the internal sense bases provide a link between our volitional actions and subsequent perceptions.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7193">In [[mathematics]], the [[infinite set|infinite]] [[cardinal number]]s are represented by the [[Hebrew letter]] &lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt; ([[Aleph (letter)|aleph]]) indexed with a subscript that runs over the [[ordinal number]]s (see [[aleph number]]).  The second [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letter]] &lt;math&gt;\beth&lt;/math&gt; ([[bet (letter)|beth]]) is used in a related way, but does not necessarily index all of the numbers indexed by &lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition ==
To define the '''beth numbers''', start by letting

:&lt;math&gt;\beth_0=\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;

be the cardinality of any [[countably infinite]] [[set (mathematics)|set]]; for concreteness, take the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; of [[natural number]]s to be a typical case. Denote by ''P''(''A'') the [[power set]] of ''A''; i.e., the set of all subsets of ''A''. Then define

:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\alpha+1}=2^{\beth_{\alpha}},&lt;/math&gt;

which is the cardinality of the power set of ''A'' if &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the cardinality of ''A''.

Given this definition,

:&lt;math&gt;\beth_0,\ \beth_1,\ \beth_2,\ \beth_3,\ \dots&lt;/math&gt;

are respectively the cardinalities of

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N},\ P(\mathbb{N}),\ P(P(\mathbb{N})),\ P(P(P(\mathbb{N}))),\ \dots.&lt;/math&gt;

so that the second beth number &lt;math&gt;\beth_1&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c&lt;/math&gt;, the [[cardinality of the continuum]], and the third beth number &lt;math&gt;\beth_2&lt;/math&gt; is the cardinality of the power set of the continuum.

Because of [[Cantor's theorem]] each set in the preceding sequence has cardinality strictly greater than the one preceding it. For infinite [[limit ordinal]]s λ the corresponding beth number is defined as the [[supremum]] of the beth numbers for all ordinals strictly smaller than λ:

:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\lambda}=\sup\{ \beth_{\alpha}:\alpha&lt;\lambda \}.&lt;/math&gt;

One can also show that the [[von Neumann universe]]s &lt;math&gt;V_{\omega+\alpha} &lt;/math&gt; have cardinality &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;.

== Relation to the aleph numbers ==
Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], infinite cardinalities are [[total order|linearly ordered]]; no two cardinalities can fail to be comparable.  Thus, since by definition no infinite cardinalities are between &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that 
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_1 \ge \aleph_1.&lt;/math&gt;
Repeating this argument (see  [[transfinite induction]]) yields 
&lt;math&gt;\beth_\alpha \ge \aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; 
for all ordinals &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[continuum hypothesis]] is equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_1=\aleph_1.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Continuum hypothesis#The generalized continuum hypothesis|generalized continuum hypothesis]] says the sequence of beth numbers thus defined is the same as the sequence of [[aleph number]]s, i.e., 
&lt;math&gt;\beth_\alpha = \aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; 
for all ordinals &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

== Specific cardinals ==

=== Beth null ===
Since this is defined to be &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; or [[aleph null]] then sets with cardinality &lt;math&gt;\beth_0&lt;/math&gt; include:

*the [[natural number]]s '''N'''
*the [[rational number]]s '''Q'''
*the [[algebraic number]]s
*the [[computable number]]s and [[computable set]]s
*the set of [[finite set]]s of [[integer]]s
*the set of [[Multiset|finite multiset]]s of [[integer]]s
*the set of [[finite sequence]]s of [[integer]]s

=== Beth one ===

{{main|cardinality of the continuum}}

Sets with cardinality &lt;math&gt;\beth_1&lt;/math&gt; include:

*the [[transcendental numbers]]
*the [[irrational number]]s
*the [[real number]]s '''R'''
*the [[complex number]]s '''C'''
*the [[uncomputable real number]]s
*[[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
*the [[power set]] of the [[natural number]]s (the set of all subsets of the natural numbers)
*the set of [[sequence]]s of integers (i.e. all functions '''N''' → '''Z''', often denoted '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt;)
*the set of sequences of real numbers, '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt;
*the set of all [[real analytic function]]s from '''R''' to '''R'''
*the set of all [[continuous function]]s from '''R''' to '''R'''
*the set of finite subsets of real numbers
*the set of all [[analytic function]]s from '''C''' to '''C'''

=== Beth two ===
&lt;math&gt;\beth_2&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced ''beth two'') is also referred to as '''2&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;''' (pronounced ''two to the power of c'').

Sets with cardinality &lt;math&gt;\beth_2&lt;/math&gt; include:

* The [[power set]] of the set of [[real number]]s, so it is the number of [[subset]]s of the [[real line]], or the number of sets of real numbers
* The power set of the power set of the set of natural numbers
* The set of all [[function (mathematics)|functions]] from '''R''' to '''R''' ('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sup&gt;)
* The set of all functions from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
* The power set of the set of all functions from the set of natural numbers to itself, so it is the number of sets of sequences of natural numbers

=== Beth omega ===
&lt;math&gt;\beth_\omega&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced ''beth omega'') is the smallest uncountable [[strong limit cardinal]].

==Generalization==
The more general symbol &lt;math&gt;\beth_\alpha(\kappa)&lt;/math&gt;, for ordinals α and cardinals κ, is occasionally used. It is defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_0(\kappa)=\kappa,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\alpha+1}(\kappa)=2^{\beth_{\alpha}(\kappa)},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\lambda}(\kappa)=\sup\{ \beth_{\alpha}(\kappa):\alpha&lt;\lambda \}&lt;/math&gt; if λ is a limit ordinal.

So
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\alpha}=\beth_{\alpha}(\aleph_0).&lt;/math&gt;

In ZF, for any cardinals κ and μ, there is an ordinal α such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa \le \beth_{\alpha}(\mu).&lt;/math&gt;

And in ZF, for any cardinal κ and ordinals α and β:

:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\beta}(\beth_{\alpha}(\kappa)) = \beth_{\alpha+\beta}(\kappa).&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] absent [[ur-element]]s with or without the [[axiom of choice]], for any cardinals κ and μ, the equality

:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\beta}(\kappa) = \beth_{\beta}(\mu)&lt;/math&gt;

holds for all sufficiently large ordinals β (that is, there is an ordinal α such that the equality holds for every ordinal β ≥ α).

This also holds in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with ur-elements with or without the axiom of choice provided the ur-elements form a set which is equinumerous with a [[pure set]] (a set whose [[transitive set#Transitive closure|transitive closure]] contains no ur-elements). If the axiom of choice holds, then any set of ur-elements is equinumerous with a pure set.

'''COBIT''' ('''Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies''') is a good-practice [[Software framework|framework]] created by international professional association [[ISACA]] for [[Information technology management|information technology (IT) management]] and [[Corporate governance of information technology|IT governance]]. COBIT provides an implementable "set of controls over information technology and organizes them around a logical framework of IT-related processes and enablers."&lt;ref name="HaesCOBIT15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zNgRBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 |chapter=Chapter 5: COBIT as a Framework for Enterprise Governance of IT |title=Enterprise Governance of Information Technology: Achieving Alignment and Value, Featuring COBIT 5 |author1=Haes, S.D. |author2=Grembergen, W.V. |publisher=Springer |edition=2nd |year=2015 |pages=103–128 |isbn=9783319145471 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ISACA first released COBIT in 1996, originally as a set of control objectives{{clarify|date=June 2018}} to help the financial audit community better maneuver in IT-related environments.&lt;ref name="HaesCOBIT15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="StroudIntro12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaca.org/education/upcoming-events/documents/intro-cobit5.pdf |format=PDF |title=Introduction to COBIT 5 |author=Stroud, R.E. |publisher=ISACA |date=2012 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing value in expanding the framework beyond just the auditing realm, ISACA released a broader version 2 in 1998 and expanded it even further by adding management guidelines in 2000's version 3. The development of both the [[AS 8015]]: ''Australian Standard for Corporate Governance of Information and Communication Technology'' in January 2005&lt;ref name="Cruz10AS8015_06"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtREBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95 |chapter=10: AS 8015-2005 - Australian Standard for Corporate Governance of ICT |title=Frameworks for IT Management |author=da Cruz, M. |editor1=van Bon, J. |editor2=Verheijen, T. |publisher=Van Haren Publishing |year=2006 |pages=95–102 |isbn=9789077212905 |accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the more international draft standard ISO/IEC DIS 29382 (which soon after became [[ISO/IEC 38500]]) in January 2007&lt;ref name="ISODIS29382Arch"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?&amp;item_s_key=00490704 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623191716/https://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?&amp;item_s_key=00490704 |title=ISO/IEC DIS 29382: 2007 Edition, February 1, 2007 |work=IHS Standards Store |publisher=IHS, Inc |archivedate=23 June 2016 |accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased awareness of the need for more information and communication technology (ICT) governance components. ISACA inevitably added related components/frameworks with versions 4 and 4.1 in 2005 and 2007 respectively, "addressing the IT-related business processes and responsibilities in value creation ([[Val IT]]) and risk management ([[Risk IT]])."&lt;ref name="HaesCOBIT15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="StroudIntro12" /&gt;

In April 2012, COBIT 5 was released. Several drivers were responsible for the transition from 4.1 to 5:&lt;ref name="ProtivitiISACA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protivit.us/en-UK/Documents/Insights/IT-Flash-Report-COBIT5.PDF |format=PDF |title=ISACA Releases COBIT 5: Updated Framework for the Governance and Management of IT |publisher=Provitivi, Inc |date=18 May 2012 |accessdate=23 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* need for a more coherent understanding of how existing standards, best practices, and other tools relate and augment each other;
* need for a more end-to-end business/organization scope that covers all business and IT functions;
* need for improved guidance on hot-topic items such as [[enterprise architecture]] and emerging technologies;
* need for tighter integration among COBIT and other ISACA research, recommendations, and frameworks;
* need for tighter integration with external standards, recommendations, and frameworks; and
* need for improved information organization and dissemination concerning the framework.

An add-on for COBIT 5 related to information security was released in December 2012, and one related to assurance was released in June 2013.&lt;ref name="C5InfoSec"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/Information-Security-Product-Page.aspx |title=COBIT 5 for Information Security |publisher=ISACA |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C5Assur"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/Assurance-product-page.aspx |title=COBIT 5 for Assurance |publisher=ISACA |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November and December of 2018, the next version of COBIT, COBIT 2019, was released.

==The COBIT framework==
COBIT was initially "Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies," though before the release of the framework people talked of "CobiT" as "Control Objectives for IT"&lt;ref name="KatsikasInfo96"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_pLAAAAYAAJ |title=Information Systems Security: Facing the Information Society of the 21st Century |series=IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology |editor1=Katsikas, S. |editor2=Gritzalis, D. |publisher=Springer |page=358 |year=1996 |isbn=9780412781209 |quote=The [[McCumber cube|McCumber model]] has great similarities with the CobiT - Control Objectives for IT - framework (CobiT 1995).}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology."&lt;ref name="ISACAFirstArch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaca.org/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961107101619/http://www.isaca.org/ |title=Welcome to the ISACA/F |publisher=ISACA |date=18 October 1996 |archivedate=7 November 1996 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework defines a set of generic processes for the management of IT, with each process defined together with process inputs and outputs, key process-activities, process objectives, performance measures and an elementary [[Capability Maturity Model|maturity model]]. COBIT also provides a set of recommended best practices for governance and control process of information systems and technology with the essence of aligning IT with business. COBIT 5 consolidates COBIT 4.1, Val IT and Risk IT into a single framework acting as an enterprise framework aligned and interoperable with other frameworks and standards.&lt;ref name="HaesCOBIT15" /&gt;

===Framework and components===
The business orientation of COBIT consists of linking business goals to IT goals, providing metrics and maturity models to measure their achievement, and identifying the associated responsibilities of business and IT process owners.

The process focus of COBIT is illustrated by a process model that subdivides IT into four domains (Plan and Organize; Acquire and Implement; Deliver and Support; and Monitor and Evaluate) and 34 processes inline with the responsibility areas of plan, build, run, and monitor. It is positioned at a high level and has been aligned and harmonized with other, more detailed IT standards and good practices such as [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission|COSO]], [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library|ITIL]], [[Business Information Services Library|BiSL]], [[ISO 27000]], [[Capability Maturity Model Integration|CMMI]], [[TOGAF]] and [[PMBOK]]. COBIT acts as an integrator of these different guidance materials, summarizing key objectives under one umbrella framework that link the good practice models with governance and business requirements.&lt;ref name="HaesCOBIT15" /&gt; COBIT 5 further consolidated and integrated the COBIT 4.1, Val IT 2.0 and Risk IT frameworks and drew from ISACA's ''IT Assurance Framework'' (ITAF) and the ''Business Model for Information Security'' (BMIS).

The framework and its components can, when utilized well, also contribute to ensuring regulatory compliance. It can encourage less wasteful information management, improve retention schedules, increase business agility, and lower costs while better complying with data retention and management regulations.&lt;ref name="LuelligACOBIT13"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.isaca.org/Journal/archives/2013/Volume-5/Pages/A-COBIT-Approach-to-Regulatory-Compliance-and-Defensible-Disposal.aspx |title=A COBIT Approach to Regulatory Compliance and Defensible Disposal |journal=ISACA Journal |author1=Luellig, L. |author2=Frazier, J. |volume=5 |year=2013 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COBIT components include:
* Framework: Organizes IT governance objectives and good practices by IT domains and processes and links them to business requirements.
* Process descriptions: A reference process model and common language for everyone in an organization. The processes map to responsibility areas of plan, build, run, and monitor.
* Control objectives: Provides a complete set of high-level requirements to be considered by management for effective control of each IT process.
* Management guidelines: Helps assign responsibility, agree on objectives, measure performance, and illustrate interrelationship with other processes.
* Maturity models: Assesses maturity and capability per process and helps to address gaps.

==Statement==
The principle states that a [[Turing completeness|universal]] [[computer|computing device]] can [[simulation|simulate]] every [[physical process]].

==History==
The principle was stated by Deutsch in 1985 with respect to [[finitary]] machines and processes.&lt;!-- so who (re)interpreted it in the form stated here? --&gt; He observed that [[classical physics]], which makes use of the concept of [[real number]]s, cannot be simulated by a [[Turing machine]], which can only represent [[computable real]]s. Deutsch proposed that [[quantum computer]]s may actually obey the CTD principle, assuming that the laws of [[quantum physics]] can completely describe every physical process.

An earlier version of this thesis for classical computers was stated by Alan Turing's friend and student [[Robin Gandy]] in 1980&lt;ref&gt;Gandy, R. (1980).

'''Contingent self-esteem''' (CSE) is [[self-esteem]] based on the approval of others or on [[Social comparison theory|social comparisons]]. Certain events will shape one's self-esteem when the individual bases their self-worth on the outcome of those events.&lt;ref name="Ups and Downs"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knee|first=Chip|author2=Amber L. Bush |author3=Amy Canevello |author4=Astrid Cook |title=Relationship-Contingent Self-Esteem and the Ups and Downs of Romantic Relationships|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2008|volume=95 |issue=3|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.3.608|url=http://www.class.uh.edu/enews/2008/11/__docs/Knee_study.pdf|accessdate=16 October 2011 |pages=608–627 |pmid=18729698}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success or failure of any situation can result in fluctuations of an individual's self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Ups and Downs" /&gt; A manifestation of someone with contingent self-esteem is excessive [[self-consciousness]]. Such excessive self-consciousness, as occurs with contingent self-esteem, involves extreme criticism of one's self, concern of how they are perceived by their peers, and feelings of discomfort in social settings.&lt;ref name="Ups and Downs" /&gt; One's [[self-esteem]] is directly affected when domains of [[contingencies]] are used to measure one's [[self worth]]. [[Self-esteem]] can also be affected when an [[individual]] compares their [[human physical appearance|appearance]]  or [[objective (goal)|success]] to that of someone else or when their [[self-esteem]] is [[contingent]] to the [[interpersonal|relationships]] around them.

==Self-esteem and contingent self-worth==
According to William James in his journal ''The Principles of Psychology'', [[self-esteem]] can be a stable and unstable trait.&lt;ref name="self worth"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crocker|first=Jennifer|author2=Katherine M. Knight|title=Contingencies of Self-Worth|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2005|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/14/4/200.full.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2011|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00364.x  | volume=14 | pages=200–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's self-esteem fluctuates in response to different events.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; Men and women alike are also selective about which events affect their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; This instability of self-esteem is the result of having contingent [[self worth]].&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; Good and bad events can momentarily raise or lower feelings of self-esteem.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; Those fluctuations can cause an individual to seek those positive feelings associated with success and avoid the negative feelings associated with failure.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; Therefore, contingencies of self-worth have control over one's behavior.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt;

Students who base their self-esteem on their [[academic]] successes use their school work to prove their intelligence.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; Since [[objective (goal)|failure]]s in domains of contingency have negative effects on one's self-esteem, students will avoid failure by increasing their effort, by abandoning their goals and becoming completely unmotivated, or by making excuses to lessen the impact on their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; In [[Jennifer Crocker]]'s journal ''Contingencies of self-worth: Implications for self-regulation and [[psychology|psychological]] [[vulnerability]]'', the author states that contingencies of self-worth are used as a source of [[motivation]] and a [[psychology|psychological]] [[vulnerability]].&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; This means that contingencies of self-worth can cause one to strive for success or weaken one's self-esteem.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; Contingencies of self-worth are associated with validation of one's abilities in the domain of contingency, and students spend more time on activities related to their specific domains of contingency.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; When individuals have self-validation goals, mistakes, failures, [[criticism]], and [[negative feedback]] are seen as [[threat]]s rather than learning opportunities.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; A solution would be to replace self-validating goals with learning goals. Adopting goals that are good for the individual as well as others around them may lessen the impact of contingent self-esteem.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt;

==Appearance Related Social Comparisons==
People with high levels of CSE are prone to making [[social comparison theory|social comparisons]] based on [[human physical appearance|appearance]] . As a result, these individuals more than often feel diminished.&lt;ref name="SPA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patrick|first=Heather|author2=Clayton Neighbors |author3=C. Raymond Knee |title=Appearance-Related Social Comparison: The Role of Contingent Self Esteem and Self Perceptions of Attractiveness|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=April 1, 2004|doi=10.1177/0146167203261891|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/30/4/501.full.pdf+html|accessdate=19 November 2011|volume=30|pages=501–514}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Appearance Related Social Comparisons''' are comparisons of one's perceived [[human physical appearance|appearance]] to the [[human physical appearance|appearance]] of other people.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; Those who make [[social comparison theory|social comparisons]] base their feelings of self-worth on meeting social standards and expectations.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; Appearance Related Social Comparisons can affect one's [[self-esteem]] in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, appearance related social comparisons can help develop and maintain one's level of [[self worth]]. On the negative side, [[human physical appearance|appearance]]  related social comparisons can cause the decline of an individual's [[self worth]] and value.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; Women who measure their self-worth based on cultural standards may be affected more by [[social comparison theory|social comparisons]], particularly when they have a low [[Self-perception theory|Self perception]] of [[attractiveness]].&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt;

Images in the media are notorious for creating unrealistic standards of [[beauty]], most especially for women.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; Comparisons with [[mass media|media]] standards can cause an individual with high levels of CSE to acquire feelings of inadequacy. Mass media provides examples of beauty that are often unattainable by the average male or female.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; Although this is true in most cases, everyone is not equally affected by unrealistic standards of beauty in the media and social comparisons with the people they are surrounded by.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; One's [[Self-perception theory|Self perception]] of [[human physical appearance|appearance]]  is how an individual measures his/her own beauty.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; Women with lower [[Self-perception theory|Self perceptions]] of [[human physical appearance|appearance]]  tend to be more dissatisfied after viewing "ideal" images of women in the media. This same issue can also be seen in the male population but isn't as prevalent and widespread as in the female population.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; In the journal "Media Images and Women's Self-evaluations", researchers D. Henderson-King, Henderson-King, and Hoffman demonstrated that the importance that women place on [[physical attractiveness]] is associated with images displayed in the [[mass media|media]].&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt;

===Body image===
'''Body image''' is a very important developmental concern for children and young adults.&lt;ref name="Body Image"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grossbard|first=Joel R.|author2=Christine M.

[[Body mass index]] (BMI) has a great influence on the attitudes and behaviors in men and women.&lt;ref name="Body Image" /&gt; Women in the [[western world|westernized society]] believe being thin is the cultural [[norm (social)|norm]], while men are thriving to gain weight and muscles.&lt;ref name="Body Image" /&gt; Both men and women are striving for a lower BMI in order to fit in with "society".&lt;ref name="Body Image" /&gt; Joel R. Grossbard, Christine M. Lee, Clayton Neighbors, and Mary E.

==Relationship Contingent Self-Esteem==
{{Main|Relationship-contingent self-esteem}}
Relationship contingent self-esteem (RCSE) is a [[psychological disorder]] that has been researched by Chip Knee and his colleagues at the [[University of Houston]].&lt;ref name="RCSE"&gt;{{cite web|last=Science Daily|title=Too Much Commitment May be Unhealthy for Relationships, Professor Says|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081202170828.htm|publisher=ScienceDaily LLC|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; RCSE is the way one determines how they feel about themselves based on the outcome of their [[intimate relationship|relationship]].&lt;ref name="RCSE" /&gt; Individuals with RCSE take problems in their relationship personally.&lt;ref name="rcsesteem" /&gt; They do not tend to think rationally about situations, which may result to them feeling bad for themselves in the end.&lt;ref name="rcsesteem" /&gt; Any setback in a relationship can lead to many negative feelings such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and changes in mood.&lt;ref name="RCSE" /&gt; Individuals with high levels of relationship based self-esteem are highly committed to their relationships, but become devastated when faced with challenges in their relationship. In extreme cases, they may resort to [[Self-harm|hurting]] or [[Suicide|killing themselves]].&lt;ref name="rcsesteem"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vjeru|first=Tudor|title=Wrong Kind of Commitment Undermines Relationships|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Wrong-Kind-of-Commitment-Undermines-Relationships-99129.shtml|publisher=Softpedia|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; RCSE is seen as a negative and unhealthy factor of a relationship, which can be mediated if identified in its early stages.&lt;ref name="RCSE" /&gt;

Chip Knee and a group of researchers also studied [[heterosexual]] relationships in college and how they are affected by RCSE.&lt;ref name="RCSE" /&gt; They presented the results of this study in a paper entitled “Relationship Contingent Self-Esteem – The Ups and Downs of Romantic Relationship”.&lt;ref name="RCSE" /&gt; RCSE was present in some of these relationships; however, some levels were higher than others.&lt;ref name="RCSE" /&gt; Relationships with higher levels of RCSE are placed under unnecessary strain.&lt;ref name="rcsesteem" /&gt; The point of the study is to show how relationships can guide one’s thoughts, emotions, and behaviors; and the unhealthy way people attach themselves to relationships.&lt;ref name="RCSE" /&gt;

The '''Defence Evaluation and Research Agency''' (normally known as '''DERA''') was a part of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) between 1995 and 2 July 2001. At the time it was the United Kingdom's largest science and technology organisation. 

== Formation and Operation ==
DERA was formed in April 1995 as an [[wikt:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of the following organisations: 
*[[Defence Research Agency]] (DRA) which was set up in April 1991 and comprised 
**[[Royal Aircraft Establishment|Royal Aerospace Establishment]] (RAE)
**[[Admiralty Research Establishment]] (ARE)
**[[Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment]] (RARDE)
**[[Royal Signals and Radar Establishment]] (RSRE)
*[[Defence Test and Evaluation Organisation]] (DTEO)
*[[Defence CBRN Centre|Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment]] (CBDE at [[Porton Down]]), which became part of the Protection and Life Sciences Division (PLSD)
*[[Centre for Defence Analysis]] (CDA).

The chief executive throughout DERA's existence was [[John Chisholm (executive)|John Chisholm]]. DERA's staffing level was around 9000 scientists, technologists and support staff.

== Dissolution ==
DERA was split into two organisations, based on short-lived transition bodies known as PDERA ("privatised" DERA) - becoming a [[commerce|commercial]] firm, [[QinetiQ]] - and "RDERA" ( "retained" in Government DERA) - becoming the [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory]] (Dstl).

At the split, QinetiQ was formed from the majority (about 3/4 of the staff and most of the facilities) of DERA, with Dstl assuming responsibility for those aspects which were best done in government. A few examples of the work undertaken by Dstl include [[nuclear reaction|nuclear]], [[chemical]], and [[Biological warfare|biological]] [[research]]. In the time since the split both organisations have undergone significant change programmes. QinetiQ has increased its focus on overseas research with a number of US and other foreign acquisitions, whereas Dstl has a major rationalisation programme.

An '''explanation''' is a set of [[Statement (logic)|statements]] usually constructed to [[description|describe]] a set of facts which clarifies the [[causality|cause]]s, [[wiktionary:context|context]], and [[Logical consequence|consequences]] of those facts. This description of the facts et cetera may establish [[rule of inference|rule]]s or [[axiom|law]]s, and may clarify the existing rules or laws in relation to any objects, or phenomena examined.  The components of an explanation can be [[wikt:implicit|implicit]], and interwoven with one another.

An explanation is often underpinned by an [[understanding]] or norm that can be represented by different media such as music, text, and graphics. Thus, an explanation is subjected to [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], and discussion.

In [[scientific research]], explanation is one of several purposes for empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;Babbie, Earl (2007) ''The Practice of Social Research.'' (11th edition) Belmont, CA: Thompson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Remler, D.K. and Van Ryzin, G (2011). ''Research Methods in Practice.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Explanation is a way to uncover new knowledge, and to report relationships among different aspects of studied [[phenomena]]. Explanation attempts to answer the "why"  and "how" questions. Explanations have varied [[explanatory power]]. The formal [[hypothesis]] is the theoretical tool used to verify explanation in empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Patricia M.|last1=Shields|authorlink1=Patricia M. Shields|last2= Rangarjan|first2= N. |year=2013|title= A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVYbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Patricia+M.+Shields%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3iIU6X7HdOYyASjlIDwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location= Stillwater, OK|publisher= New Forums Press|chapter=See chapter 3 for an extended discussion of the connection between explanation as purpose and hypotheses as framework in empirical research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Shields, Hassan Tajalli (2006). "Intermediate Theory: The Missing Link in Successful Student Scholarship". ''Journal of Public Affairs Education'' 12 (3): 313–334.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments ==
{{Main|Argument}}

While arguments attempt to show that something is, will be, or should be the case, explanations try to show ''why'' or ''how'' something is or will be. If Fred and Joe address the issue of ''whether'' or not Fred's cat has fleas, Joe may state: "Fred, your cat has fleas. Observe the cat is scratching right now." Joe has made an ''argument that'' the cat has fleas. However, if Fred and Joe agree on the fact that the cat has fleas, they may further question ''why'' this is so and put forth an ''explanation'': "The reason the cat has fleas is that the weather has been damp." The difference is that the attempt is not to settle whether or not some [[claim (logic)|claim]] is true, but to show ''why'' it is true.

In this sense, arguments aim to contribute ''knowledge'', whereas explanations aim to contribute ''understanding''.

Arguments and explanations largely resemble each other in [[rhetoric]]al use. This is the cause of much difficulty in [[critical thinking|thinking critically]] about [[proposition|claims]]. There are several reasons for this difficulty.

* People often are not themselves clear on whether they are arguing for or explaining something.
* The same types of words and phrases are used in presenting explanations and arguments.
* The terms 'explain' or 'explanation,' et cetera are frequently used in arguments.
* Explanations are often used within arguments and presented so as to serve ''as arguments''.

== Justification ==
{{Main|Theory of justification}}

Justification is the reason why someone properly holds a [[belief]], the explanation as to why the belief is a true one, or an account of how one knows what one knows. In much the same way arguments and explanations may be confused with each other, so too may explanations and justifications. Statements which are justifications of some action take the form of arguments. For example, attempts to justify a theft usually explain the motives (e.g., to feed a starving family).

It is important to be aware when an explanation is ''not'' a justification. A criminal profiler may offer an explanation of a suspect's behavior (e.g.; the person lost their job, the person got evicted, etc.). Such statements may help us understand why the person committed the crime, however an uncritical listener may believe the speaker is trying to gain sympathy for the person and his or her actions. It does not follow that a person proposing an explanation has any sympathy for the views or actions being explained. This is an important distinction because we need to be able to understand and explain terrible events and behavior in attempting to discourage or prevent them.

== Types ==
There are many and varied events, objects, and facts which require explanation. So too, there are many different types of explanation. [[Aristotle]] recognized at least [[Four causes|four types]] of explanation. Other types of explanation are [[Deductive-nomological model|Deductive-nomological]], Functional, Historical, Psychological, Reductive, Teleological, Methodological explanations.

== Meta-explanation ==
The notion of meta-explanation is important in behavioral scenarios that involve conflicting agents. In these scenarios, implicit or explicit conflict can be caused by contradictory agents' interests, as communicated in their explanations for why they behaved in a particular way, by a lack of knowledge of the situation, or by a mixture of explanations of multiple factors. In many cases to assess the plausibility of explanations, one must analyze two following components and their interrelations: (1) explanation at the actual object level (explanation itself) and (2) explanation at the higher level (meta-explanation). Comparative analysis of the roles of both is conducted to assess the plausibility of how agents explain the scenarios of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Galitsky, Boris, de la Rosa, Josep-Lluis  and Kovalerchuk, Boris ''Assessing plausibility of explanation and meta-explanation in inter-human conflict'' [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2047062 Engineering Application of AI] V 24 Issue 8, pp 1472-1486, (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Object-level explanation assesses the plausibility of individual claims by using a traditional approach to handle argumentative structure of a dialog. Meta-explanation links the structure of a current scenario with that of previously learned scenarios of multi-agent interaction. The scenario structure includes agents' communicative actions and argumentation defeat relations between the subjects of these actions. The data for both object-level and meta-explanation can be visually specified, and a plausibility of how agent behavior in a scenario can be visually explained. Meta-explanation in the form of machine learning of scenario structure can be augmented by conventional explanation by finding arguments in the form of defeasibility analysis of individual claims, to increase the accuracy of plausibility assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Galitsky, B.,  Kuznetsov SO ''Learning communicative actions of conflicting human agents'' [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1451477 J. Exp. Theor. Artif. Intell.] 20(4): 277-317 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

A ratio between object-level and meta-explanation can be defined as the relative accuracy of plausibility assessment based on the former and latter sources. The groups of scenarios can then be clustered based on this ratio; hence, such a ratio is an important parameter of human behavior associated with explaining something to other humans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4981">{{short description|A confession obtained from a person under duress}}
A '''forced confession''' is a confession obtained from a suspect or a [[prison]]er by means of [[torture]] (including [[enhanced interrogation technique]]s) or other forms of [[duress]]. Depending on the level of coercion used, a forced confession is not valid in revealing the truth. The person being interrogated may agree to the story presented to him or even make up falsehoods himself in order to satisfy the interrogator and discontinue his suffering.&lt;ref name="illum2016-07-08"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boffa|first1=Christa|title=Palazz Castellania|url=http://www.illum.com.mt/ahbarijiet/socjali/42432/palazz_castellania#.V5yZyPl961t|work=Illum|date=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730125955/http://www.illum.com.mt/ahbarijiet/socjali/42432/palazz_castellania|archivedate=30 July 2016|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries the Latin phrase "''Confessio est regina probationum''" (In [[English language|English]]: Confession is the [[Queen of evidence]]) justified the use of forced confession in the European legal system. When especially during the [[Middle Ages]] acquiring a confession was the most important thing during preparations before a trial, than the method used to get the confession seemed irrelevant, [[de facto]] sanctioning the use of torture to extract forced confession. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

By the late 18th century, most scholars and lawyers thought of the forced confession not only as a relic of past times and morally wrong but also ineffective as the victim of torture may confess to anything just to ease their suffering.

Developments in the 20th century, notably the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], greatly reduced the legal acceptance of forced confessions.  However, for most of legal history they have been accepted in most of the world, and are still accepted in some jurisdictions.

==Modern day usage==
Since 2001, as part of its [[War on Terror]] the United States using the [[CIA]] operates a network of off shore prisons, called [[black site]]s, probably the most famous of which is [[Guantánamo Bay detention camp]].
State officials have admitted to the press and in court to be using various torture techniques (authorised by the District attorney) to interrogate suspects of terrorism, sometimes after [[forced disappearance]] or [[extraordinary rendition by the United States]]. 

When these systematic acts were made public by the international media, the [[European Union]], [[United Nations]], the international press and various human rights movements condemned their practice.
The US Supreme Court did not discontinue their usage and repeatedly ruled against hearing citizens that underwent forced confessions, even after they were found innocent, claiming that a trial would constitute a breach of national security.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/safefree/extraordinaryrendition/22201res20051206.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous case is that of [[Khalid El-Masri]]. He appealed several times aided by different international human rights movements and lawyers, yet the US Supreme Court retained its usage of forced confession techniques, and denied a hearing of the evidence.

===Forced televised confessions in China===

The [[People's Republic of China]] systematically employed forced televised confession against [[list of Chinese dissidents|Chinese dissidents]] and workers of various [[human rights group]] in an attempt to discredit, smear and suppress dissident voices and activism, as well as part of the state propaganda. These scripted confessions, obtained via systematic [[duress]] and [[torture]], are broadcast on the [[China Central Television|state television]]. Notable victims includes [[Wang Yu (lawyer)|Wang Yu]], a female [[human rights]] [[lawyer]], and [[Sweden|Swedish]] citizen [[Peter Dahlin]], an [[NGO]] worker and [[human rights activist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/world/asia/china-confession-cctv.html|title=China Uses Foreigners’ Televised Confessions to Serve Its Own Ends|last=Wong|first=Edward|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theinitium.com/article/20180709-opinion-luosiling-peter-dahlin-forced-confession/|title=瑞典人彼得·達林：我在中國上電視認罪，《1984》噩夢成為現實|website=theinitium.com|language=zh-Hant|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/world/asia/china-forced-confessions-propaganda.html|title=How China Uses Forced Confessions as Propaganda Tool|last=Myers|first=Steven Lee|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8624">'''General set theory (GST)''' is [[George Boolos]]'s (1998) name for a fragment of the [[axiomatic set theory]] [[Zermelo set theory|Z]]. GST is sufficient for all mathematics not requiring [[infinite set]]s, and is the weakest known set theory whose [[theorem]]s include the [[Peano axioms]].

==Ontology==
The ontology of GST is identical to that of [[ZFC]], and hence is thoroughly canonical. GST features a single [[primitive notion|primitive]] [[ontology|ontological]] notion, that of [[set (mathematics)|set]], and a single ontological assumption, namely that all individuals in the [[universe of discourse]] (hence all [[mathematical object]]s) are sets. There is a single [[primitive notion|primitive]] [[binary relation]], [[element (mathematics)|set membership]]; that set ''a'' is a member of set ''b'' is written ''a''∈''b'' (usually read "''a'' is an [[element (mathematics)|element]] of ''b''").

==Axioms==
The  symbolic axioms below are from Boolos (1998: 196), and govern how sets behave and interact. The natural language versions of the axioms are intended to aid the intuition. The background logic is [[first order logic]] with [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]].
&lt;!-- The symbolic axioms should not be changed without discussion on the talk page. Altering these axioms would constitute original research. However the English descriptions may be changed. The choice of Boolos is open for discussion on the talk page. --&gt;

1) [[Axiom of Extensionality]]: The sets ''x'' and ''y'' are the same set if they have the same members.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y [\forall z [z \in x \leftrightarrow z \in y] \rightarrow x = y].&lt;/math&gt;
The converse of this axiom follows from the substitution property of equality.

2) [[axiom schema of specification|Axiom Schema of Specification]] (or ''Separation'' or ''Restricted Comprehension''):  If ''z'' is a set and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is any property which may be satisfied by all, some, or no elements of ''z'', then there exists a subset ''y'' of ''z'' containing just those elements ''x'' in ''z'' which satisfy the property &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. The [[restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] to ''z'' is necessary to avoid [[Russell's paradox]] and its variants. More formally, let &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; be any formula in the language of GST in which ''x'' is free and ''y'' is not. Then all instances of the following schema are axioms:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall z \exists y \forall x [x \in y \leftrightarrow ( x \in z \land \phi(x))].&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
3) [[Axiom of Adjunction]]: If ''x'' and ''y'' are sets, then there exists a set ''w'', the ''adjunction'' of ''x'' and ''y'', whose members are just ''y'' and the members of ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;''Adjunction'' is seldom mentioned in the literature. Exceptions are Burgess (2005) ''passim'', and QIII in Tarski and Givant (1987: 223).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- :&lt;math&gt; \forall x \forall z \exist y \forall v [v \in y \leftrightarrow (v \in z \or v=x)].&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y \exist w \forall z [ z \in w \leftrightarrow (z \in x \or z=y)].&lt;/math&gt;

''Adjunction'' refers to an elementary operation on two sets, and has no bearing on the use of that term elsewhere in mathematics, including in [[adjoint functor|category theory]].

==Discussion==
GST is the fragment of [[Zermelo set theory|Z]] obtained by omitting the axioms [[axiom of union|Union]], [[axiom of power set|Power Set]], Elementary Sets (essentially [[Pairing axiom|Pairing]]) and [[axiom of infinity|Infinity]], then taking Adjunction, a theorem of Z, as an axiom. The result is a [[first order theory]].

Setting &amp;phi;(''x'') in ''Separation'' to ''x''&amp;ne;''x'', and assuming that the [[Domain of a function|domain]] is nonempty, assures the existence of the [[empty set]]. ''Adjunction'' implies that if ''x'' is a set, then so is &lt;math&gt;S(x) = x \cup \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;. Given ''Adjunction'', the usual construction of the [[successor ordinal]]s from the [[empty set]] can proceed, one in which the [[natural number]]s are defined as &lt;math&gt;\varnothing,\,S(\varnothing),\,S(S(\varnothing)),\,\ldots,&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Peano's axioms]]). More generally, given any model ''M'' of ZFC, the collection of [[hereditarily finite set]]s in ''M'' will satisfy the GST axioms. Therefore, GST cannot prove the existence of even a countable [[infinite set]], that is, of a set whose cardinality is ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Even if GST did afford a countably infinite set, GST could not prove the existence of a set whose [[cardinality]] is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, because GST lacks the [[axiom of power set]]. Hence GST cannot ground [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[geometry]], and is too weak to serve as a [[foundation of mathematics|foundation for mathematics]].

Boolos was interested in GST only as a fragment of [[Zermelo set theory|Z]] that is just powerful enough to interpret [[Peano arithmetic]]. He never lingered over GST, only mentioning it briefly in several papers discussing the systems of [[Frege]]'s ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic|Grundlagen]]'' and ''Grundgesetze'', and how they could be modified to eliminate [[Russell's paradox]]. The system '''A&amp;xi;''''[&amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;] in Tarski and Givant (1987: 223) is essentially GST with an [[Peano axioms|axiom schema of induction]] replacing [[axiom schema of specification|Specification]], and with the existence of an [[empty set]] explicitly assumed.

GST is called STZ in Burgess (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;223.&lt;ref&gt;The [[axiom of empty set|Empty Set]] axiom in STZ is redundant, because the existence of the empty set is derivable from the axiom schema of Specification.&lt;/ref&gt; Burgess's theory ST&lt;ref&gt;Called S' in Tarski et al. (1953: 34).&lt;/ref&gt; is GST with [[axiom of empty set|Empty Set]] replacing the [[axiom schema of specification]]. That the letters "ST" also appear in "GST" is a coincidence.

==Metamathematics==
The most remarkable fact about ST (and hence GST), is that these tiny fragments of set theory give rise to such rich metamathematics. While ST is a small fragment of the well-known canonical set theories [[ZFC]] and [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]], ST [[interpretability|interprets]] [[Robinson arithmetic]] (Q), so that ST inherits the nontrivial metamathematics of Q. For example, ST is [[decidability (logic)|essentially undecidable]] because Q is, and every consistent theory whose theorems include the ST axioms is also essentially undecidable.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess (2005), 2.2, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes GST and every axiomatic set theory worth thinking about, assuming these are consistent. In fact, the [[decidability (logic)|undecidability]] of ST implies the undecidability of [[first-order logic]] with a single [[binary predicate]] letter.&lt;ref&gt;Tarski et al. (1953), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Q is also incomplete in the sense of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]. Any axiomatizable theory, such as ST and GST, whose theorems include the Q axioms is likewise incomplete. Moreover, the [[consistency]] of GST cannot be proved within GST itself, unless GST is in fact inconsistent.

GST is:
*Mutually interpretable with [[Peano arithmetic]] (thus it has the same proof-theoretic strength as PA);
*Immune to the three great antinomies of [[naïve set theory]]: [[Russell's paradox|Russell's]], [[Burali-Forti paradox|Burali-Forti's]], and [[Cantor's paradox|Cantor's]];
*Not [[axiom schema|finitely axiomatizable]]. Montague (1961) showed that [[ZFC]] is not finitely axiomatizable, and his argument carries over to GST. Hence any axiomatization of GST must either include at least one [[axiom schema]] such as [[Axiom schema of specification|Separation]];
*Interpretable in [[relation algebra]] because no part of any GST axiom lies in the scope of more than three [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s. This is the [[necessary and sufficient condition]] given in Tarski and Givant (1987).

'''Grievous bodily harm''' (often abbreviated to '''GBH''') is a term used in [[English criminal law]] to describe the severest forms of [[assault]]. It refers to two offences that are respectively created by sections 18 and 20 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]. The distinction between these two sections is the requirement of [[intention (criminal law)|specific intent]] for section 18; the offence under section 18 is variously referred to as "wounding with intent" or "causing grievous bodily harm with [[specific intent|intent]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, paragraph 19-201 at page 1614&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the offence under section 20 is variously referred to as "unlawful wounding",&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, paragraph 19-201 at page 1614&lt;/ref&gt; "malicious wounding"&lt;ref&gt;The [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], section 29(1)(a)&lt;/ref&gt; or "inflicting grievous bodily harm".&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, paragraph 19-201 at page 1614&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statute==

===Section 18===
This section now reads:

{{Blockquote|Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously by any means whatsoever wound or cause any grievous bodily harm to any person,&amp;nbsp;... with intent,&amp;nbsp;... to do some&amp;nbsp;... grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist or prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of any person, shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable&amp;nbsp;... to be kept in penal servitude for life&amp;nbsp;...}}

The words from "or shoot" to "some other", except the words "with intent to do some" were repealed by section 10(2) of, and Part III of Schedule 3 to, the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]].

The words omitted in the penultimate place were repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision (No. 2) Act 1893]].

The words omitted at the end were repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1892]] and the [[Statute Law Revision (No. 2) Act 1893]].

This section replaces section 4 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1837]], which in turn replaced section 12 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]], which in turn replaced section 1 of [[Lord Ellenborough's Act]] (1803).

====Felony====

See the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] and the [[Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967]].

====Penal servitude====

See the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] and the [[Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953]].

===Section 20===
In England and Wales, section 20 now reads:

{{Blockquote|Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously wound or inflict any grievous bodily harm upon any other person, either with or without any weapon or instrument, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and being convicted thereof shall be liable&amp;nbsp;... to be kept in penal servitude&amp;nbsp;...}}

The words omitted were repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1892]].

====Misdemeanour====

See the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]].

====Liable to be kept in penal servitude====

See the [[Penal Servitude Act 1891]] and the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]].

==The offences==
None of the words used in these sections are defined elsewhere in the Act, but they have been defined by case law.

===Wound===

{{About|the legal definition of 'wound'|the medical definition|Wound|section=yes}}

For this purpose, a '''wound''' is an [[injury]] that breaks the continuity of the [[skin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wm8DAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA278,M1 ''Rex v Wood and M'Mahon''] (1830) 1 Mood CC 278; {{cite BAILII|court=EWHC |division=Exch |year=1834 |num=J79 |courtname=auto |litigants=Moriarty v Brookes}}; [[Carrington and Payne's Reports|C &amp; P]] 684; ''Rex v Beckett'' (1836) 1 Mood &amp; R 526; See also {{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|351|2003|litigants=R v Shepherd |date=28 November 2003 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There must be a division of the whole skin and not merely a division of the [[cuticle]] or upper layer.&lt;ref&gt;''Reg v M'Loughlin'' (1838) 8 C &amp; P 635; ''C (a minor) v Eisenhower'' [1984] QB 331 (1984) 78 Cr App R 48&lt;/ref&gt;

A single drop of blood is sufficient, but it must fall outside the body: see ''JJC (a minor) v. Eisenhower'' (1984) 78 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 48. In this case, a pellet gun was fired at the victim. The bullet ruptured blood vessels above his eye, causing his eye to fill with fluid. Lord Justice Robert Goff said the rupturing of blood vessels is an internal wound; only the breaking of whole skin would warrant a wounding charge.

A bruise or internal rupturing of blood vessels is not a wound,&lt;ref&gt;''C (a minor) v Eisenhower'' [1984] QB 331 (1984) 78 Cr App R 48&lt;/ref&gt; and neither is a broken bone.&lt;ref&gt;''Reg v M'Loughlin'' (1838) 8 C &amp; P 635&lt;/ref&gt;

Wounding does not imply the use of a weapon; a kick may be wounding.

'''Grievous bodily harm''' means "really serious bodily harm": ''DPP v Smith'' [1961] AC 290, HL; ''R v Cunningham'' [1982] AC 566, HL; ''R v Brown (A)'' [1994] 1 AC 212, HL; ''R v Brown and Stratton'' [1998] [[Criminal Law Review|Crim LR]] 485, CA. It encompasses a range of injuries: ''R v Woodland'' (2007) 48 MVR 360.

However, ''R v Saunders'' [1985] Crim LR 230, [1985] LS Gaz R 1005, allows "serious injury" as a sufficient direction to the [[jury]]. It is for the judge to decide whether the word "really" needs to be used in their direction to the jury: ''R v Janjua and Choudhury'' [1999] 1 Cr App R 91, The Times, 8 May 1998, CA (in this case, as a knife with a blade at least 5½ inches long had been used, it was not possible that something less than really serious harm was intended).

===Inflict and cause===
{{See also|Causation (law)}}

Where, shortly before the conclusion of a performance at a theatre, the defendant put out the lights on a staircase which a large number of persons had to descend in order to leave the theatre, and he also obstructed the exit by placing an iron bar across a doorway which they had in leaving to pass, and upon the lights being thus extinguished, a large proportion of the audience were seized by panic and rushed in fright down the staircase forcing those in front against the iron bar, he "inflicted" injuries which resulted by reason of the pressure and struggling of the crowd thus created on the staircase.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Martin'' (1881) 8 QBD [https://archive.org/stream/lawreportsqueen07unkngoog#page/n86/mode/1up 54]; (1881) 51 LJMC 36; (1881) 45 [[Law Times Reports|LT]] 444; (1881) 46 JP 228; (1881) 30 WR 106; (1881) 14 [[Cox's Criminal Cases|Cox CC]] 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Ormerod said that the effect of the decision in ''R v Gibbins and Proctor''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Gibbins and Proctor'' (1918) 13 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 134, (1918) 82 JP 287, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]&lt;/ref&gt; appears to be that the offence of causing grievous bodily harm under section 18 can be committed by an omission.&lt;ref&gt;Ormerod, David. Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law. Thirteenth Edition. Oxford University Press. 2011. p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''R v Mandair'',&lt;ref&gt;[1994] 2 All ER 715, [1995] 1 AC 208, 99 Cr App R 250, [1994] 2 WLR 700, HL&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Mackay of Clashfern LC. said, with the agreement of the majority of the House of Lords, "In my opinion&amp;nbsp;... the word 'cause' is wider or at least not narrower than the word 'inflict'".&lt;ref&gt;''R v Mandair'' [1995] 1 AC 208 at 215, HL&lt;/ref&gt;

In [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/34.html ''R v Burstow, R v Ireland''],&lt;ref&gt;''R v Ireland, R v Burstow'' [1998] 1 Cr App Rep 177, [1997] 3 WLR 534, [1998] AC 147, [1997] 4 All ER 225, [[House of Lords|HL]] (24 July 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm under section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 can be committed where no physical violence is applied directly or indirectly to the body of the victim.&lt;ref&gt;This is the point of law that the Court of Appeal certified as being of general importance.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Hope of Craighead said "the word "inflict" implies that the consequence of the act is something which the victim is likely to find unpleasant or harmful." He said that, in the context of a criminal act, the words "cause" and "inflict" may be taken to be interchangeable.

Lord Steyn described the actions of Burstow as follows: "During an eight month period in 1995 covered by the indictment he continued his campaign of harassment. He made some silent telephone calls to her. He also made abusive calls to her. He distributed offensive cards in the street where she lived. He was frequently, and unnecessarily, at her home and place of work. He surreptitiously took photographs of the victim and her family. He sent her a note which was intended to be menacing, and was so understood."

Neither offence requires that a [[common assault]] be committed.

====1983 to 1997====
In ''R v Wilson, R v Jenkins'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Wilson, R v Jenkins'' [1984] AC 242, [1983] 3 WLR 686, 77 Cr App R 319, [1983] Crim LR 36, [[House of Lords|HL]], reversing [1983] 1 WLR 356&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Roskill said:
{{quote|In our opinion,  grievous bodily harm may be inflicted … either where the accused has directly and violently "inflicted" it by assaulting the victim, or where the accused has "inflicted" it by doing something, intentionally, which, although it is not itself a direct application of force  to the body of the victim, does directly result in force  being applied violently to the body of the victim, so that he suffers grievous bodily harm.}}

====Before 1983====
In ''R v Clarence'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23, (1888) 16 Cox CC 511, (1888) 5 TLR 61, (1888) 53 JP 149, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; it appeared that at a time when the prisoner knew, but his wife did not know, that he was suffering from [[Gonorrhea|gonorrhoea]], he had "connection" with her; that the result was that the disease was communicated to her, and that had she been aware of the prisoner's condition she would not have submitted to the intercourse.

Clarence's conviction under section 20 was quashed by the [[Court for Crown Cases Reserved]] by a majority of 9 to 4. [[Alfred Wills|Wills]],&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 36 to 37, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archibald Levin Smith|A L Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 37 to 38, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Fitzjames Stephen|Stephen]]&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 41 to 42, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; JJ. specifically said that they thought the disease had not been inflicted within the meaning of the word "inflict" in section 20. [[James Charles Mathew|Mathew J.]]&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 38, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; said that he agreed with Stephen. Stephen&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 46, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; said that he had been informed that [[William Grantham|Grantham J.]] agreed with him. [[John Walter Huddleston|Huddleston B.]]&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 56, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; said that he thoroughly agreed with Stephen. [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge CJ.]]&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 66, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; said that he agreed with all or almost all of what Wills and Stephen said. [[Henry Hawkins, 1st Baron Brampton|Hawkins J.]]&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 47 to 50, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; specifically said that he thought it had been inflicted within the meaning of the word "inflict" in section 20.

Wills J said (footnotes have been included in the body of the text, indicated by "(1)"):

{{Blockquote|But I think the section clearly points to the infliction of direct and intentional violence, whether with a weapon, or the fist, or the foot, or any other part of the person or in any other way not involving the use of the weapon, as for instance by creating a panic at a theatre whereby people trampled on one another: Reg. v. Martin. (1) 8 Q. B. D. 54 The prisoner in that case did what was certain to make people crush one another, perhaps to death, and the grievous bodily harm was as truly inficted by him as if he had hurled a stone at someone's head. Take also the illustration of my brother Stephen, of a man who digs a pit for another to fall into, whereby that other is injured. I do not think that this section was ever intended to apply to the administration of poison, and most of the arguments I have used to shew that sexual offences were not intended to be dealt with in s. 47 apply with equal force to s. 20. The Court for the consideration of Crown Cases Reserved in Reg. v. Taylor (1) Law Rep. 1 C. c. R. 194. decided that in the offence of "unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm", an assault is necessarily included. So far as the decision is concerned, the same question may be said to arise under s. 20 as under s. 47. But I think the argument is even stronger here, for the context seems to me to shew that direct personal violence of some kind was intended, so that even if the constructive assault contended for by those who support a conviction under s. 47 were established, a conviction under this section would still be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 36 to 37, CCR&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stephen J said:

{{Blockquote|But is there an "infliction of bodily harm either with or without any weapon or instrument"? I think not for the following reasons.

The words appear to me to mean the direct causing of some grievous injury to the body itself with a weapon, as by a cut with a knife, or without a weapon, as by a blow with the fist, or by pushing a person down. Indeed, though the word "assault" is not used in the section, I think the words imply an assault and battery of which a wound or grievous bodily harm is the manifest immediate and obvious result.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 41, CCR&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A L Smith J. said "it appears to me that this offence cannot be committed unless an assault has in fact been committed, and indeed this has been so held".&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 37 to 38, CCR&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkins J. said that he thought that the contention that bodily harm cannot be legally said to be "inflicted" unless it has been brought about by some act amounting to an assault was untenable.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 47, CCR&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maliciously===
In [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1967/1.html ''R v Mowatt'']&lt;ref&gt;[1967] 3 WLR 1192, [1967] EWCA Crim 1, [1968] 1 QB 421, 51 Cr App Rep 402, 131 JP 463, [1969] 3 All ER 47&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Diplock]] said:

{{Cquote|In the offence under section 20 … the word "maliciously" does import upon the part of the person who unlawfully inflicts the wound or other grievous bodily harm an awareness that his act may have the consequence of causing some physical harm to some other person … It is quite unnecessary that the accused should have foreseen that his unlawful act might cause physical harm of the gravity described in the section, i.e. a wound or serious physical injury. It is enough that he should have foreseen that some physical harm to some person, albeit of a minor character, might result.}}

Therefore, the defendant must at least be reckless as to whether some harm, albeit not necessarily serious harm, is likely to be caused, (see [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/1.html ''R v Savage, DPP v Parmenter''],&lt;ref&gt;[1992] 1 AC 699, [1991] 3 WLR 914, [1991] 4 All ER 698, (1991) 94 Cr App R 193, [1992] Crim LR 288, [[House of Lords|HL]]&lt;/ref&gt;) but a mere intention to frighten is not enough (see ''R v Sullivan'').

In ''R v Sullivan'' [1981] Crim LR 46, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]], the appellant was tried on charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and inflicting grievous bodily harm. The victim said that the appellant and a companion were drunk. He said that while he was in a street that was eight feet wide and had a narrow pavement, the appellant drove a car through that street at twenty five to thirty miles an hour, mounted the pavement and injured him. The appellant denied that he was the driver of the car in a written statement to the police and said he could add nothing to that statement in an unsworn statement from the dock. However, during his closing speech, [[counsel for the defence]] suggested that all the appellant intended to do was frighten the victim and no more. The jury were directed that if there was an intention to frighten, and injury took place as a result, the appellant was guilty of an offence under section 20. The appellant was acquitted of the offence under section 18, but convicted of offences under section 20. The Court of Appeal held that an intention to frighten was not enough to constitute the necessary mens rea for section 20, and that the direction to the contrary effect was a misdirection. However, they dismissed the appellant's appeal. They said that a properly directed jury could not in the circumstances have come to any other conclusion than that the appellant must have been aware that what he was doing was likely to cause physical injury to the victim.

In practice, malice in the case of these offences means no more than foresight of the risk of bodily harm: ''R v Barnes'' [2005] 1 Cr App R 30.

===Specific intent===
{{Main article|Intention in English law}}

{{Cleanup rewrite|2=paragraph|date=August 2011}}
Section 18 has two separate ''[[mens rea]]'' requirements and is therefore an offence of specific rather than basic intent. ''R v Belfon'' [1976] 1 WLR 741, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]], confirmed that references to mere foresight or recklessness that harm was likely to result are sufficient for the element "unlawfully and maliciously inflict/cause" for the basic intent in both sections 18 and 20 but insufficient for the specific element. The intention either to cause or to resist arrest must be proved subjectively, say, in the charge "malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm".

The Crown Prosecution Service said that the following factors may indicate the specific intent: "a repeated or planned attack; deliberate selection of a weapon or adaptation of an article to cause injury, such as breaking a glass before an attack; making prior threats; and using an offensive weapon against, or kicking the victim's head".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offences_against_the_person/#P242_19963|title=Offences against the Person, incorporating the Charging Standard|last=Crown Prosecution Service|first=|date=|website=www.cps.gov.uk|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative verdicts===
{{Rewrite section|date=August 2011}}
Sections 20 and 47 are offences of basic intent and can be an alternative charge to section 18, and/or section 47 is a [[lesser included offense|lesser included offence]].

===Consent===

[[Consent (criminal law)|Consent]] is only an allowed defence to either section if there is considered to be a good reason.

==Mode of trial==

In England and Wales, the offence under section 18 is an [[indictable-only offence]].

In England and Wales, the offence under section 20 is [[hybrid offence|triable either way]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] (c.43), section 17(1) and Schedule 1,  paragraph 5(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentence==

===Section 18===
In England and Wales, an offence under section 18 is punishable with [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales|imprisonment for life]] or for any shorter term.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (24 &amp; 25 Vict c 100), section 18; the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] (11 &amp; 12 Geo 6 c 58), section 1(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

See the Crown Prosecution Service Sentencing Manual for case law on sentencing of section 18 [http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/wounding_or_inflicting_grievous_bodily_harm_with_intent/]. Relevant cases are:

In Northern Ireland, an offence under section 18 is punishable with imprisonment for life or for any shorter term.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (24 &amp; 25 Vict c 100), section 18; the [[Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953]], section 1(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section 20===
In England and Wales, a person guilty of an offence under section 20 is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (24 &amp; 25 Vict c 100), section 20; the [[Penal Servitude Act 1891]] (54 &amp; 55 Vict c 69), section 1(1); the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] (11 &amp; 12 Geo 6 c 58), section 1(1)&lt;/ref&gt; or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the [[prescribed sum]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] (c 43), section 32(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a person is convicted on indictment of an offence under section 20, other than an offence for which the sentence falls to be imposed under section 227 or 228 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], the court, if not precluded from sentencing an offender by its exercise of some other power, may impose a fine instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way in which the court has power to deal with him, subject however to any enactment requiring the offender to be dealt with in a particular way.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], section 163; this power was previously created by section 30(1) of the [[Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973]] and then by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/6/section/127 section 127] of the [[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An offence under section 20 is a specified offence for the purposes of chapter 5 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] because it is a specified violent offence.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], section 224(1) as read with section 224(3) and paragraph 7 Part 1 of Schedule 15 (where the offence is described as "malicious wounding")&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a serious offence for the purposes of that Chapter because it is not, apart from section 225, punishable in the case of a person aged 18 or over by imprisonment for life, or by imprisonment for a determinate period of ten years or more.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], section 224(2)&lt;/ref&gt; This means that sections 227 and 228 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] (which relate to extended sentences) apply where a person is convicted of an offence under section 20, committed after the commencement of section 227 or 228 (as the case may be) and the court considers that there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by the offender of further specified offences.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], sections 227(1) and 228(1)(a) and (b)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racially or religiously aggravated offence==

In England and Wales, section 29(1)(a) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] (c 37) creates the distinct offence of [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998#Racially or religiously aggravated offences|racially or religiously aggravated wounding or infliction of bodily harm]]. This is an aggravated version of the offence under section 20.

Collected guesses are used to better understand how humans perceive correlations in scatter plots by identifying features within scatter plots, such as outliers, that cause players to over or under estimate the true correlation.&lt;ref name=Tarran/&gt; 

By 1 February 2016, over 2 million guesses had been collected from 100,000 participants.&lt;ref name=Tarran/&gt; 

==Gameplay==



In the single-player mode, players are presented with a stream of scatter plots depicting the relationship between two random variables. The aim is to guess the true [[Pearson correlation coefficient]], where the guess can range from 0 (no correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation). Players start out with three lives and no points. Guesses made within 0.05 of the true correlation are awarded a life and five points. Guesses made within 0.10 are awarded one point, and guesses over 0.10 are not awarded any points and a life is deducted. The game ends when the player has run out of lives.&lt;ref name=Wagih/&gt;

In the two player mode, opponents challenge each other at guessing the true correlation. Once a session has been initiated between two players, both players are presented with the same scatter plot. The player with the closest guess to true correlation is awarded a point. In the event of a draw, no points are awarded to either player. The first player to reach 10 points is declared the winner.&lt;ref name=Wagih/&gt;

{{General relativity sidebar |solutions}}

The '''Gödel metric''' is an [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solution]] of the [[Einstein field equations]] in which the [[stress–energy tensor]] contains two terms, the first representing the matter density of a homogeneous distribution of swirling dust particles ([[dust solution]]), and the second associated with a nonzero [[cosmological constant]] (see [[lambdavacuum solution]]). It is also known as the '''Gödel solution''' or '''Gödel universe'''.

This solution has many unusual properties—in particular, the existence of [[closed timelike curve]]s that would allow [[time travel]] in a universe described by the solution. Its definition is somewhat artificial in that the value of the cosmological constant must be carefully chosen to match the density of the dust grains, but this [[spacetime]] is an important pedagogical example.

The solution was found in 1949 by [[Kurt Gödel]].&lt;ref&gt;Gödel, K., [http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.21.447 "An Example of a New Type of Cosmological Solutions of Einstein's Field Equations of Gravitation"], ''[[Rev. Mod. Phys.]]'' '''21''', 447, published July 1, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Like any other [[Pseudo-Riemannian manifold#Lorentzian manifold|Lorentzian spacetime]], the Gödel solution presents the [[metric tensor]] in terms of some local [[coordinate chart]]. It may be easiest to understand the Gödel universe using the cylindrical coordinate system (presented below), but this article uses the chart that Gödel originally used. In this chart, the [[line element]] is
:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = \frac{1}{2\omega^2} \left[ -(dt + e^x dz)^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} e^{2x} dz^2 \right], \qquad -\infty &lt; t, x, y, z &lt; \infty,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a nonzero real constant, which turns out to be the angular velocity of the surrounding dust grains around the ''y'' axis, as measured by a "non-spinning" observer riding one of the dust grains. "Non-spinning" means that it doesn't feel centrifugal forces, but in this coordinate frame it would actually be turning on an axis parallel to the ''y'' axis. As we shall see, the dust grains stay at constant values of ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''. Their density in this coordinate chart increases with ''x'', but their density in their own frames of reference is the same everywhere.

==Properties==
To study the properties of the Gödel solution, we will adopt the [[Frame fields in general relativity|frame field]] (dual to the coframe read off the metric as given above),
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_0 = \sqrt{2} \omega \, \partial_t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_1 = \sqrt{2} \omega \, \partial_x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_2 = \sqrt{2} \omega \, \partial_y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_3 = 2 \omega \, \left( \exp(-x) \, \partial_z - \, \partial_t \right).&lt;/math&gt;
This frame defines a family of inertial observers who are ''comoving with the dust grains''. However, computing the [[Fermi–Walker differentiation|Fermi–Walker derivative]]s with respect to &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_0&lt;/math&gt; shows that the spatial frames are ''spinning'' about &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_2&lt;/math&gt; with angular velocity &lt;math&gt;-\omega&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that the ''nonspinning inertial frame'' comoving with the dust particles is
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{f}_0 = \vec{e}_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{f}_1 = \cos(\omega t) \, \vec{e}_1 - \sin(\omega t) \, \vec{e}_3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{f}_2 = \vec{e}_2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{f}_3 = \sin(\omega t) \, \vec{e}_1 + \cos(\omega t) \, \vec{e}_3.&lt;/math&gt;

===Einstein tensor===
The components of the [[Einstein tensor]] (with respect to either frame above) are
:&lt;math&gt;G^{\hat{a}\hat{b}} = \omega^2 \, \operatorname{diag} (-1,1,1,1) + 2 \omega^2 \, \operatorname{diag} (1,0,0,0).&lt;/math&gt;
Here, the first term is characteristic of a [[lambdavacuum solution]] and the second term is characteristic of a pressureless [[perfect fluid]] or dust solution. Notice that the cosmological constant is carefully chosen to partially cancel the matter density of the dust.

===Topology===
The Gödel spacetime is a rare example of a ''regular'' (singularity-free) solution of the Einstein field equation. Gödel's original chart (given here) is [[Riemannian manifold#Geodesic completeness|geodesically complete]] and singularity free; therefore, it is a global chart, and the spacetime is [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and therefore, simply connected.

===Curvature invariants===
In any Lorentzian spacetime, the fourth-rank [[Riemann tensor]] is a multilinear operator on the four-dimensional space of [[tangent vector]]s (at some event), but a [[linear operator]] on the six-dimensional space of [[bivector]]s at that event. Accordingly, it has a [[characteristic polynomial]], whose roots are the [[eigenvalue]]s. In the Gödel spacetime, these eigenvalues are very simple:
* triple eigenvalue zero,
* double eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;-\omega^2&lt;/math&gt;,
* single eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\omega^2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Killing vectors===
This spacetime admits a five-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] of [[Killing vector]]s, which can be generated by ''[[time translation]]'' &lt;math&gt; \partial_t &lt;/math&gt;, two ''spatial translations'' &lt;math&gt; \partial_y, \; \partial_z&lt;/math&gt;, plus two further Killing vector fields:
:&lt;math&gt; \partial_x - z \, \partial_z &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; -2 \exp(-x) \, \partial_t + z \, \partial_x + \left( \exp(-2x) -z^2/2 \right) \, \partial_z.&lt;/math&gt;
The isometry group acts ''transitively'' (since we can translate in &lt;math&gt;t,y,z&lt;/math&gt;, and using the fourth vector we can move along &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as well), so the spacetime is ''homogeneous''. However, it is not ''isotropic'', as we shall see.

It is obvious from the generators just given that the slices &lt;math&gt;x=x_0&lt;/math&gt; admit a [[transitive group action|transitive]] [[abelian group|abelian]] three-dimensional [[transformation group]], so a quotient of the solution can be reinterpreted as a stationary cylindrically symmetric solution. Less obviously, the slices &lt;math&gt;y=y_0&lt;/math&gt; admit an [[SL2(R)|SL(2,'''R''')]] action, and the slices &lt;math&gt;t=t_0&lt;/math&gt; admit a Bianchi III (c.f. the fourth Killing vector field). We can restate this by saying that our symmetry group includes as three-dimensional subgroups examples of Bianchi types I, III and VIII. Four of the five Killing vectors, as well as the curvature tensor, do not depend upon the coordinate y. Indeed, the Gödel solution is the [[Cartesian product]] of a factor '''R''' with a three-dimensional Lorentzian manifold ([[signature]] -++).

It can be shown that the Gödel solution is, up to [[local isometry]], the ''only'' perfect fluid solution of the Einstein field equation admitting a five-dimensional Lie algebra of Killing vectors.

===Petrov type and Bel decomposition===
The [[Weyl tensor]] of the Gödel solution has [[Petrov type D|Petrov type '''D''']]. This means that for an appropriately chosen observer, the tidal forces have ''[[Coulomb form]]''.

To study the tidal forces in more detail, we compute the [[Bel decomposition]] of the Riemann tensor into three pieces, the tidal or electrogravitic tensor (which represents tidal forces), the magnetogravitic tensor (which represents [[spin-spin force]]s on spinning test particles and other gravitational effects analogous to magnetism), and the topogravitic tensor (which represents the spatial sectional curvatures).

Observers comoving with the dust particles find that the ''tidal tensor'' (with respect to &lt;math&gt;\vec{u} = \vec{e}_0&lt;/math&gt;, which components evaluated in our frame) has the form
:&lt;math&gt;{E\left[ \vec{u} \right]}_{\hat{m}\hat{n}} = \omega^2 \, \operatorname{diag}(1,0,1).&lt;/math&gt;
That is, they measure isotropic tidal tension orthogonal to the distinguished direction &lt;math&gt;\partial_y&lt;/math&gt;.

The gravitomagnetic tensor ''vanishes identically''
:&lt;math&gt;{B\left[ \vec{u} \right]}_{\hat{m}\hat{n}} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
This is an artifact of the unusual symmetries of this spacetime, and implies that the putative "rotation" of the dust does not have the gravitomagnetic effects usually associated with the gravitational field produced by rotating matter.

The principal [[Lorentz invariant]]s of the Riemann tensor are
:&lt;math&gt;R_{abcd} \, R^{abcd} = 12 \omega^4, \; R_{abcd} {{}^\star R}^{abcd} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The vanishing of the second invariant means that some observers measure no gravitomagnetism, which is consistent with what was just said. The fact that the first invariant (the [[Kretschmann invariant]]) is constant reflects the homogeneity of the Gödel spacetime.

===Rigid rotation===

The frame fields given above are both ''inertial'', &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\vec{e}_0} \vec{e}_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, but the ''vorticity vector'' of the timelike geodesic congruence defined by the timelike unit vectors is 
:&lt;math&gt;-\omega \vec{e}_2&lt;/math&gt;
This means that the world lines of nearby dust particles are twisting about one another. Furthermore, the ''shear tensor'' of the congruence &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_0&lt;/math&gt; ''vanishes'', so the dust particles exhibit ''rigid rotation''.

===Optical effects===

If we study the past [[light cone]] of a given observer, we find that null geodesics moving orthogonally to &lt;math&gt;\partial_y&lt;/math&gt; ''spiral inwards'' toward the observer, so that if he looks ''radially'', he sees the other dust grains in progressively ''time-lagged positions''. However, the solution is stationary, so it might seem that an observer riding on a dust grain will ''not'' see the other grains rotating about himself. However, recall that while the first frame given above (the &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_j&lt;/math&gt;) appears static in our chart, the Fermi–Walker derivatives show that, in fact, it is ''spinning'' with respect to gyroscopes. The second frame (the &lt;math&gt;\vec{f}_j&lt;/math&gt;) appears to be spinning in our chart, but it is ''gyrostabilized'', and a nonspinning inertial observer riding on a dust grain will indeed see the other dust grains rotating clockwise with angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; about his axis of symmetry. It turns out that in addition, optical images are expanded and sheared in the direction of rotation.

If a nonspinning inertial observer looks along his axis of symmetry, he sees his coaxial nonspinning inertial peers apparently nonspinning with respect to himself, as we would expect.

===Shape of absolute future===

According to Hawking and Ellis, another remarkable feature of this spacetime is the fact that, if we suppress the inessential y coordinate, light emitted from an event on the world line of a given dust particle spirals outwards, forms a ''circular cusp'', then spirals inward and ''reconverges at a subsequent event'' on the world line of the original dust particle. This means that observers looking orthogonally to the &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_2&lt;/math&gt; direction can see only finitely far out, and also see themselves at an earlier time.

The cusp is a nongeodesic closed null curve. (See the more detailed discussion below using an alternative coordinate chart.)

===Closed timelike curves===

Because of the homogeneity of the spacetime and the mutual twisting of our family of timelike geodesics, it is more or less inevitable that the Gödel spacetime should have [[closed timelike curve]]s (CTCs). Indeed, ''there are CTCs through every event in the Gödel spacetime''. This causal anomaly seems to have been regarded as the whole point of the model by Gödel himself, who was apparently striving to prove, and arguably succeeded in proving, that Einstein's equations of spacetime are not consistent with what we intuitively understand time to be (i. e. that it passes and the past no longer exists, the position philosophers call [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]], whereas Gödel seems to have been arguing for something more like the philosophy of [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]), much as he, conversely, succeeded with [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|his incompleteness theorems]] in showing that intuitive mathematical concepts could not be completely described by formal mathematical systems of proof. See the book ''A World Without Time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Yourgrau | first = Palle | title = A world without time: the forgotten legacy of Gödel and Einstein | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 0465092942 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein was aware of Gödel's solution and commented in ''Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/einstein/works/1940s/reply.htm |title= Einstein's Reply to Criticisms |last1=Einstein |first1=Albert |last2= |first2= |year= 1949 |work= Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that if there are a series of causally-connected events in which "the series is closed in itself" (in other words, a closed timelike curve), then this suggests that there is no good physical way to define whether a given event in the series happened "earlier" or "later" than another event in the series:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In that case the distinction "earlier-later" is abandoned for world-points which lie far apart in a cosmological sense, and those paradoxes, regarding the direction of the causal connection, arise, of which Mr. Gödel has spoken.

Such cosmological solutions of the gravitation-equations (with not vanishing A-constant) have been found by Mr. Gödel. It will be interesting to weigh whether these are not to be excluded on physical grounds.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Globally nonhyperbolic===

If the Gödel spacetime admitted any boundaryless temporal hyperslices (e.g. a [[Cauchy surface]]), any such CTC would have to intersect it an odd number of times, contradicting the fact that the spacetime is simply connected. Therefore, this spacetime is not [[globally hyperbolic]].

==A cylindrical chart==

In this section, we introduce another coordinate chart for the Gödel solution, in which some of the features mentioned above are easier to see.

===Derivation===

Gödel did not explain how he found his solution, but there are in fact many possible derivations. We will sketch one here, and at the same time verify some of the claims made above.

Start with a simple frame in a ''cylindrical'' type chart, featuring two undetermined functions of the radial coordinate:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_0=\partial_t, \; \vec{e}_1=\partial_z, \; \vec{e}_2=\partial_r, \, \vec{e}_3=\frac{1}{b(r)} \, \left( -a(r) \, \partial_t + \partial_\phi \right)&lt;/math&gt;
Here, we think of the timelike unit vector field &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_0&lt;/math&gt; as tangent to the world lines of the dust particles, and their world lines will in general exhibit nonzero vorticity but vanishing expansion and shear. Let us demand that the Einstein tensor match a dust term plus a vacuum energy term. This is equivalent to requiring that it match a perfect fluid; i.e., we require that the components of the Einstein tensor, computed with respect to our frame, take the form
:&lt;math&gt; G^{\hat{i}\hat{j}} = \mu \, \operatorname{diag}(1,0,0,0) + p \, \operatorname{diag}(0,1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt;
This gives the conditions
:&lt;math&gt; b^{\prime\prime\prime} = \frac{b^{\prime\prime} \, b^{\prime}}{b}, \; \left( a^\prime \right)^2 = 2 \, b^{\prime\prime} \, b&lt;/math&gt;
Plugging these into the Einstein tensor, we see that in fact we now have &lt;math&gt;\mu = p&lt;/math&gt;. The simplest nontrivial spacetime we can construct in this way evidently would have this coefficient be some nonzero but ''constant'' function of the radial coordinate. Specifically, with a bit of foresight, let us choose &lt;math&gt;\mu = \omega^2&lt;/math&gt;. This gives
:&lt;math&gt; b(r) = \frac{\sinh(\sqrt{2} \omega \,r)}{\sqrt{2} \omega}, \; a(r) = \frac{\cosh(\sqrt{2} \omega r)}{\omega} + c&lt;/math&gt;
Finally, let us demand that this frame satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_3 = \frac{1}{r} \, \partial_\phi + O \left( \frac{1}{r^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
This gives &lt;math&gt;c=-1/\omega&lt;/math&gt;, and our frame becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_0=\partial_t, \; \vec{e}_1=\partial_z, \; \vec{e}_2=\partial_r, \; \vec{e}_3 = \frac{ \sqrt{2} \omega }{ \sinh( \sqrt{2} \omega r ) } \, \partial_\phi - \frac{\sqrt{2}\sinh(\sqrt{2} \omega r)}{1+\cosh(\sqrt{2} \omega r)} \, \partial_t&lt;/math&gt;

===Appearance of the light cones===

From the metric tensor we find that the vector field &lt;math&gt;\partial_\phi&lt;/math&gt;, which is ''spacelike'' for small radii, becomes ''null'' at &lt;math&gt;r=r_c&lt;/math&gt; where
:&lt;math&gt;r_c = \frac{\operatorname{arccosh}(3)}{\sqrt{2} \omega}&lt;/math&gt;
This is because at that radius we find that &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_3 = \frac{ \omega }2 \, \partial_\phi - \partial_t,&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;\frac{ \omega }2 \, \partial_\phi=\vec{e}_3+\vec{e}_0&lt;/math&gt; and is therefore null. The circle &lt;math&gt;r = r_c&lt;/math&gt; at a given ''t'' is a closed null curve, but not a null geodesic.

Examining the frame above, we can see that the coordinate &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is inessential; our spacetime is the direct product of a factor '''R''' with a signature -++ three-manifold. Suppressing &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; in order to focus our attention on this three-manifold, let us examine how the appearance of the light cones changes as we travel out from the axis of symmetry &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt;:
[[File:Goedel lambdadust samplecones.gif|frame|center|Two light cones (with their accompanying frame vectors) in the cylindrical chart for the Gödel lambda dust solution. As we move outwards from the nominal symmetry axis, the cones ''tip forward'' and ''widen''. Vertical coordinate lines (representing the world lines of the dust particles) are ''timelike''.]]
When we get to the critical radius, the cones become tangent to the closed null curve.
&lt;!-- I'm taking out this figure because I don't think it's right. The cones should remain conical at the critical radius. e0+e2 and e0-e2 are always in the cone, but e0 is not.
[[File:Goedel lambdadust tiltcones.gif|frame|center|A closed null curve depicted in the cylindrical chart for the Gödel lambdadust solution.]]--&gt;

===A congruence of closed timelike curves===

At the critical radius &lt;math&gt;r = r_c&lt;/math&gt;, the vector field &lt;math&gt;\partial_\phi&lt;/math&gt; becomes null. For larger radii, it is ''timelike''. Thus, corresponding to our symmetry axis we have a timelike [[Congruence (general relativity)|congruence]] made up of ''circles'' and corresponding to certain observers. This congruence is however ''only defined outside the cylinder'' &lt;math&gt;r=r_c&lt;/math&gt;.

This is not a geodesic congruence; rather, each observer in this family must maintain a ''constant acceleration'' in order to hold his course. Observers with smaller radii must accelerate harder; as &lt;math&gt;r \rightarrow r_c&lt;/math&gt; the magnitude of acceleration diverges, which is just what is expected, given that &lt;math&gt;r=r_c&lt;/math&gt; is a null curve.

===Null geodesics===

If we examine the past light cone of an event on the axis of symmetry, we find the following picture:
[[File:Goedel lambdadust centralcone inspiral.gif|frame|center|The null geodesics spiral counterclockwise toward an observer on the axis of symmetry. This shows them from "above".]]
Recall that vertical coordinate lines in our chart represent the world lines of the dust particles, but ''despite their straight appearance in our chart'', the congruence formed by these curves has nonzero vorticity, so the world lines are actually ''twisting about each other''. The fact that the null geodesics spiral inwards in the manner shown above means that when our observer looks ''radially outwards'', he sees nearby dust particles, not at their current locations, but at their earlier locations. This is just what we would expect if the dust particles are in fact rotating about one another.

The null geodesics are ''geometrically straight''; in the figure, they appear to be spirals only because the coordinates are "rotating" in order to permit the dust particles to appear stationary.

===The absolute future===

According to Hawking and Ellis (see monograph cited below), all light rays emitted from an event on the symmetry axis reconverge at a later event on the axis, with the null geodesics forming a circular cusp (which is a null curve, but not a null geodesic):
[[File:Goedel lambdadust centralcone.gif|frame|center|Hawking and Ellis picture of expansion and reconvergence of light emitted by an observer on the axis of symmetry.]]
This implies that in the Gödel lambdadust solution, the [[absolute future]] of each event has a character very different from what we might naively expect.

==Cosmological interpretation==

Following Gödel, we can interpret the dust particles as galaxies, so that the Gödel solution becomes a ''cosmological model of a rotating universe''. Besides rotating, this model exhibits no [[Hubble expansion]], so it is not a realistic model of the universe in which we live, but can be taken as illustrating an alternative universe, which would in principle be allowed by general relativity (if one admits the legitimacy of a nonzero cosmological constant). Less well known solutions of Gödel's exhibit both rotation and Hubble expansion and have other qualities of his first model, but travelling into the past is not possible. According to S. W. Hawking, ''these models could well be a reasonable description of the universe that we observe'', however observational data are compatible only with a very low rate of rotation.&lt;ref name="Hawking"&gt;S. W. Hawking, ''Introductory note to 1949 and 1952'' in Kurt Gödel, ''Collected works'', Volume II (S. Feferman et al., eds).&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of these observations improved continually up until Gödel's death, and he would always ask "is the universe rotating yet?" and be told "no, it isn't".&lt;ref&gt;''Reflections on Kurt Gödel'', by Hao Wang, MIT Press, (1987), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

We have seen that observers lying on the ''y'' axis (in the original chart) see the rest of the universe rotating clockwise about that axis. However, the homogeneity of the spacetime shows that the ''direction'' but not the ''position'' of this "axis" is distinguished.

Some have interpreted the Gödel universe as a counterexample to Einstein's hopes that general relativity should exhibit some kind of [[Mach's principle]],&lt;ref name="Hawking" /&gt; citing the fact that the matter is rotating (world lines twisting about each other) in a manner sufficient to pick out a preferred direction, although with no distinguished axis of rotation.

Others{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} take ''Mach principle'' to mean some physical law tying the definition of nonspinning inertial frames at each event to the global distribution and motion of matter everywhere in the universe, and say that because the nonspinning inertial frames are precisely tied to the rotation of the dust in just the way such a Mach principle would suggest, this model ''does'' accord with Mach's ideas.

Many other exact solutions that can be interpreted as cosmological models of rotating universes are known. See the book{{which|date=January 2018}} by Ryan and Shepley for some of these generalizations.

In [[mathematics]], particularly in the theories of [[Lie group]]s, [[algebraic group]]s and [[topological group]]s, a '''homogeneous space''' for a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' is a non-empty [[manifold]] or [[topological space]] ''X'' on which ''G'' acts [[Group action#Types of actions|transitively]].  The elements of ''G'' are called the '''symmetries''' of ''X''. A special case of this is when the group ''G'' in question is the [[automorphism group]] of the space ''X'' – here "automorphism group" can mean [[isometry group]], [[diffeomorphism group]], or [[homeomorphism group]]. In this case, ''X'' is homogeneous if intuitively ''X'' looks locally the same at each point, either in the sense of isometry (rigid geometry), diffeomorphism (differential geometry), or homeomorphism (topology). Some authors insist that the action of ''G'' be [[effective group action|faithful]] (non-identity elements act non-trivially), although the present article does not. Thus there is a [[group action]] of ''G'' on ''X'' which can be thought of as preserving some "geometric structure" on ''X'', and making ''X'' into a single [[orbit (group theory)|''G''-orbit]].

==Formal definition==
Let ''X'' be a non-empty set and ''G'' a group. Then ''X'' is called a ''G''-space if it is equipped with an action of ''G'' on ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;We assume that the action is on the ''left''. The distinction is only important in the description of ''X'' as a coset space.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that automatically ''G'' acts by automorphisms (bijections) on the set. If ''X'' in addition belongs to some [[category (mathematics)|category]], then the elements of ''G'' are assumed to act as [[automorphism]]s in the same category. Thus, the maps on ''X'' affected by ''G'' are structure preserving. A homogeneous space is a ''G''-space on which ''G'' acts transitively.

Succinctly, if ''X'' is an object of the category '''C''', then the structure of a ''G''-space is a [[homomorphism]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho : G \to \mathrm{Aut}_{\mathbf{C}}(X)&lt;/math&gt;

into the group of [[automorphism]]s of the object ''X'' in the category '''C'''. The pair (''X'', ρ) defines a homogeneous space provided ρ(''G'') is a transitive group of symmetries of the underlying set of ''X''.

===Examples===
For example, if ''X'' is a [[topological space]], then group elements are assumed to act as [[homeomorphism]]s on ''X''. The structure of a ''G''-space is a group homomorphism ρ : ''G'' → Homeo(''X'') into the [[homeomorphism group]] of ''X''.

Similarly, if ''X'' is a [[differentiable manifold]], then the group elements are [[diffeomorphism]]s. The structure of a ''G''-space is a group homomorphism ρ : ''G'' → Diffeo(''X'') into the diffeomorphism group of ''X''.

[[Riemannian symmetric space]]s are an important class of homogeneous spaces, and include many of the examples listed below.

Concrete examples include:

;Isometry groups
*Positive curvature:
# Sphere ([[orthogonal group]]): &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1} \cong \mathrm{O}(n)/\mathrm{O}(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;. This is true because of the following observations: First, &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of vectors in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; with norm &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. If we consider one of these vectors as a base vector, then any other vector can be constructed using an orthogonal transformation. If we consider the span of this vector as a one dimensional subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, then the complement is an &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vector space which is invariant under an orthogonal transformation from &lt;math&gt;\text{O}(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;. This shows us why we can construct &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; as a homogeneous space.

* [[Topological vector space]]s (in the sense of topology)

==Geometry==
From the point of view of the [[Erlangen program]], one may understand that "all points are the same", in the [[geometry]] of ''X''. This was true of essentially all geometries proposed before [[Riemannian geometry]], in the middle of the nineteenth century.

Thus, for example, [[Euclidean space]], [[affine space]] and [[projective space]] are all in natural ways homogeneous spaces for their respective [[symmetry group]]s. The same is true of the models found of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] of constant [[curvature]], such as [[hyperbolic space]].

A further classical example is the space of lines in projective space of three dimensions (equivalently, the space of two-dimensional subspaces of a four-dimensional [[vector space]]). It is simple linear algebra to show that GL&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; acts transitively on those. We can parameterize them by ''line co-ordinates'': these are the 2×2 [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]] of the 4×2 matrix with columns two basis vectors for the subspace. The geometry of the resulting homogeneous space is the [[line geometry]] of [[Julius Plücker]].

==Homogeneous spaces as coset spaces==
In general, if ''X'' is a homogeneous space, and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''o''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[stabilizer (group theory)|stabilizer]] of some marked point ''o'' in ''X'' (a choice of [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]), the points of ''X'' correspond to the left [[coset]]s ''G''/''H''&lt;sub&gt;''o''&lt;/sub&gt;, and the marked point ''o'' corresponds to the coset of the identity. Conversely, given a coset space ''G''/''H'', it is a homogeneous space for ''G'' with a distinguished point, namely the coset of the identity. Thus a homogeneous space can be thought of as a coset space without a choice of origin.

In general, a different choice of origin ''o'' will lead to a quotient of ''G'' by a different subgroup ''H&lt;sub&gt;o′&lt;/sub&gt;'' which is related to ''H&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' by an [[inner automorphism]] of ''G''.  Specifically,

:&lt;math&gt;H_{o'} = gH_og^{-1} \qquad \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is any element of ''G'' for which ''go''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''o''′. Note that the inner automorphism (1) does not depend on which such ''g'' is selected; it depends only on ''g'' modulo ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''o''&lt;/sub&gt;.

If the action of ''G'' on ''X'' is continuous, then ''H'' is a [[closed subgroup]] of ''G''. In particular, if ''G'' is a [[Lie group]], then ''H'' is a [[Lie subgroup]] by [[Closed subgroup theorem|Cartan's theorem]].  Hence ''G''/''H'' is a [[smooth manifold]] and so ''X'' carries a unique [[smooth structure]] compatible with the group action.

If ''H'' is the identity subgroup {''e''}, then ''X'' is a [[principal homogeneous space]].

One can go further to [[double coset|''double'' coset]] spaces, notably [[Clifford–Klein form]]s ''Γ''\''G''/''H'', where ''Γ'' is a discrete subgroup (of ''G'') acting [[properly discontinuously]].

==Example==
For example, in the line geometry case, we can identify H as a 12-dimensional subgroup of the 16-dimensional [[general linear group]], GL(4), defined by conditions on the matrix entries

:''h''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; = 0,

by looking for the stabilizer of the subspace spanned by the first two standard basis vectors. That shows that ''X'' has dimension 4.

Since the [[homogeneous coordinates]] given by the minors are 6 in number, this means that the latter are not independent of each other. In fact, a single quadratic relation holds between the six minors, as was known to nineteenth-century geometers.

This example was the first known example of a [[Grassmannian]], other than a projective space. There are many further homogeneous spaces of the classical linear groups in common use in mathematics.

==Prehomogeneous vector spaces==
The idea of a [[prehomogeneous vector space]] was introduced by [[Mikio Sato]].

It is a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] ''V'' with a [[group action]] of an [[algebraic group]] ''G'', such that there is an orbit of ''G'' that is open for the [[Zariski topology]] (and so, dense). An example is GL(1) acting on a one-dimensional space.

The definition is more restrictive than it initially appears: such spaces have remarkable properties, and there is a classification of irreducible prehomogeneous vector spaces, up to a transformation known as "castling".

==Homogeneous spaces in physics==
[[Physical cosmology]] using the [[general theory of relativity]] makes use of the [[Bianchi classification]] system. Homogeneous spaces in relativity represent the [[space (physics)|space part]] of background [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] for some [[Physical cosmology|cosmological model]]s; for example, the three cases of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] may be represented by subsets of the Bianchi I (flat), V (open), VII (flat or open) and IX (closed) types, while the [[Mixmaster universe]] represents an [[isotropy|anisotropic]] example of a Bianchi IX cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Course of Theoretical Physics vol. 2: The Classical Theory of Fields |author=[[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]] |isbn=978-0-7506-2768-9 |year=1980 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A homogeneous space of ''N'' dimensions admits a set of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}N(N+1)&lt;/math&gt; [[Killing vectors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Gravitation and Cosmology |author=[[Steven Weinberg]] |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; For three dimensions, this gives a total of six linearly independent Killing vector fields; homogeneous 3-spaces have the property that one may use linear combinations of these to find three everywhere non-vanishing Killing vector fields &lt;math&gt;\xi^{(a)}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\xi^{(a)}_{[i;k]}=C^{a}_{\ bc}\xi^{(b)}_i \xi^{(c)}_k&lt;/math&gt;

where the object &lt;math&gt;C^{a}_{\ bc}&lt;/math&gt;, the "structure constants", form a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]] [[tensor|order-three tensor]] [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetric]] in its lower two indices (on the left-hand side, the brackets denote antisymmetrisation and ";" represents the [[covariant derivative|covariant differential operator]]). In the case of a [[Lambda-CDM|flat isotropic universe]], one possibility is &lt;math&gt;C^{a}_{\ bc}=0&lt;/math&gt; (type I), but in the case of a closed FLRW universe, &lt;math&gt;C^{a}_{\ bc}=\varepsilon^{a}_{\ bc}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^{a}_{\ bc}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]].

The '''Honneurs de la Cour''' ('''Honors of the Court''') were ceremonious presentations to the sovereign at the [[Palace of Versailles|Royal Court of France]] that were formal for women but more casual for men. It was an honour granted only to the families of [[Noblesse d'épée|ancient nobility]]. It allowed them to approach the [[King of France|King]] and the [[Queen of France|Queen]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isgn.fr/autres/img358a.pdf |title=Notice historique sur les honneurs de la Cour |language=French |publisher=Institution Saint Georges pour la Noblesse |quote=...''(etre admis aux) honneurs de la Cour, c'est-a-dire aux cercles, aux receptions, aux bals du Roi et de la Reine, pour monter dans les carrosses de Sa majeste et l'accompagner a la chasse''; in English: ''[the Honors of the Court meant] to be allow to attend the circles, receptions and balls of the King and the Queen, to get into His Majesty's carriages and to go hunting with the King''. |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721001229/http://www.isgn.fr/autres/img358a.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Honors of the Court "were the most prestigious noble honour of the 18th century, meant to honour the most ancient and representing noble families".&lt;ref name="Valette"&gt;Régis Valette, ''Catalogue de la noblesse française au XXIe siècle'', éd. Robert Laffont, Paris, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally such presentations were only granted to noble families able to prove a lineage dating back to 1400 A.D. without tracks of ennoblement. However, the king could grant exemptions to families that had been dedicated to serve him. He could also refuse a valid candidate with sufficient nobility whose family was not involved enough in the king's wars as nobles were primarily mounted warriors who had sworn allegiance to their sovereign and promised to fight for him. On a list of candidates he would then place a remark next to the name of the refused applicant saying "ne se peut" (can't be) or "attendre" (wait).

The Honors of the Court should not be mistaken for court life. The oldest nobility did not always match the court nobility. Many families living at court were descendants from [[Noblesse de robe|less ancient nobility]] while many nobles of [[Noblesse d'épée|antique nobility]] did not stay at court. Moreover, life at the Versailles Court was expensive and many were unable to afford it.

The nobleman who was granted the presentation would follow a royal hunt on board of one of the king's carriages. At that point he would be casually introduced to the king. A noblewoman's presentation was much more formal, taking place during a specific ceremony.

From 1715 to 1790,&lt;ref&gt;The ''Honneurs'' were codified in 1715 (the first year of [[Louis XV]]'s reign), there were no more presentation after the [[French Revolution|fall of the monarchy]] in 1790.&lt;/ref&gt; 942 families were granted the Honors of the Court; 880 of them were French. François Bluche, who studied the royal genealogical archives, said that among the 942 families "462 were able to prove a noble lineage dating back to 1400, if excluding sovereign houses and foreign nobles who, unlike one can think, made up more than half of the French nobleman received at Court".&lt;ref name="Bluche"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=François |last=Bluche |title=Les Honneurs de la Cour |location=Paris | series=Les Cahiers nobles |date=1957 |magazine=[[L'intermédiaire des Chercheurs et des Curieux]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has limited his work to a list of 43 [[Noble family|Houses]] especially flattered by the King's archive, these 43 families are considered of major regional or national importance and members of the highest 18th century nobility. 

According to Régis Valette&lt;ref name="Valette"/&gt; only 280 of the 880 French families who were granted the Honors of the Court still remain today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3740">In [[category theory]], a '''Krull–Schmidt category''' is a generalization of categories in which the [[Krull–Schmidt theorem]] holds. They arise, for example, in the study of finite-dimensional [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over an [[algebra over a field|algebra]].

== Definition ==

Let ''C'' be an [[additive category]], or more generally an additive [[preadditive category#R-linear categories|{{mvar|R}}-linear category]] for a [[commutative ring]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|R}}. We call ''C'' a '''Krull–Schmidt category''' provided that every object decomposes into a finite direct sum of objects having local endomorphism rings. Equivalently, ''C'' has [[split idempotent]]s and the endomorphism ring of every object is [[perfect ring#semiperfect ring|semiperfect]].

== Properties ==

One has the analogue of the Krull–Schmidt theorem in Krull–Schmidt categories:

An object is called ''indecomposable'' if it is not isomorphic to a direct sum of two nonzero objects. In a Krull–Schmidt category we have that
*an object is indecomposable if and only if its endomorphism ring is local.
*every object is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of indecomposable objects.
*if &lt;math&gt;X_1 \oplus X_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus X_r \cong Y_1 \oplus Y_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus Y_s&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_j&lt;/math&gt; are all indecomposable, then &lt;math&gt;r=s&lt;/math&gt;, and there exists a permutation &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;X_{\pi(i)} \cong Y_i&lt;/math&gt; for all {{mvar|i}}.

One can define the [[Auslander–Reiten quiver]] of a Krull–Schmidt category.

== Examples ==

* An [[abelian category]] in which every object has [[finite length]].&lt;ref&gt;This is the classical case, see for example Krause (2012), Corollary 3.3.3.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes as a special case the category of finite-dimensional modules over an algebra.
* The category of finitely-generated modules over a '''finite'''&lt;ref&gt;A finite {{mvar|R}}-algebra is an {{mvar|R}}-algebra which is finitely generated as an {{mvar|R}}-module.&lt;/ref&gt; [[associative algebra|{{mvar|R}}-algebra]], where {{mvar|R}} is a [[commutative]] [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[complete local ring]].&lt;ref&gt;Reiner (2003), Section 6, Exercises 5 and 6, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The category of [[coherent sheaves]] on a [[complete variety]] over an [[algebraically closed|algebraically-closed field]].&lt;ref&gt;Atiyah (1956), Theorem 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A non-example ===

The category of finitely-generated [[projective module]]s over the integers has split idempotents, and every module is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of copies of the regular module, the number being given by the [[invariant basis number|rank]]. Thus the category has unique decomposition into indecomposables, but is not Krull-Schmidt since the regular module does not have a local endomorphism ring.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2927">'''Legal syllogism''' is a legal concept concerning the law and its application. It is based upon deductive reasoning applied for the sake of law, hence it is also called '''legal deduction''' or '''deductive legal reasoning'''.

In legal syllogism there are two premises, minor and major, and one conclusion.

The place of the major premise is taken by a legal norm (or rule). This norm (rule) may be derived from canonical text (text of statutes, constitutions, regulations, international treaties and agreements, ordinances, bylaws etc) or from a judicial precedent. In the latter case, it can be called ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' or ruling. In the main, it can be considered as a general expression which, in generic terms, states what one ought to do or ought not to do in a certain type of circumstances. 

The facts of the case at hand (also called pending, instant, ''[[sub judice]]'', at bar or under argument) serve as the minor premise. These facts may be understood as all elements of the factual setting of the case at hand, i.e. the details of the events, things and persons which occurred in a case to which the rule/norm that constitutes the major premise is to be applied deductively.

The conclusion is formed by the legal consequence for the case at hand.

If the norm that forms the major premise is valid (binding in a given legal system) and the facts of the case at hand are proven or posited as true, the conclusion of legal syllogism which flows from subsuming these facts under this norm (rule) is supposed to be correct as well.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, "Legal Analogy as an Alternative to the Deductive Mode of Legal Reasoning." The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no 1/2017: 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, "Intricacies, Fallacy and Madness of Legal Deduction." Archiv für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie no. 4/2017: 495-496.&lt;/ref&gt;

In that sense, legal syllogism can be deemed to be equally infallible  as 'ordinary' ('logical') [[syllogism]]. Such a claim is, however, ill-founded and, in fact, subsumption of a concrete case under a general rule proves to be a value-laden and goal-oriented process. Neither is it 'logical', nor 'mechanical'.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, "Legal Analogy as an Alternative to the Deductive Mode of Legal Reasoning." The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no 1/2017: 76-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, "Intricacies, Fallacy and Madness of Legal Deduction."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4504">'''Anti-[[mimesis]]''' is a philosophical position that holds the direct opposite of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[mimesis]].  Its most notable proponent is [[Oscar Wilde]], who opined in his 1889 essay ''[[The Decay of Lying]]'' that, "Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life".  In the essay, written as a [[Platonic dialogue]], Wilde holds that anti-[[mimesis]] "results not merely from Life's imitative instinct, but from the fact that the self-conscious aim of Life is to find expression, and that Art offers it certain beautiful forms through which it may realise that energy."&lt;ref name=McGrath1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilde1889 /&gt;

What is found in life and nature is not what is really there, but is that which artists have taught people to find there, through art.  As in an example posited by Wilde, although there has been fog in London for centuries, one notices the beauty and wonder of the fog because "poets and painters have taught the loveliness of such effects...They did not exist till Art had invented them."&lt;ref name=McGrath1999 /&gt;

McGrath places the antimimetic philosophy in a tradition of [[Irish literature|Irish writing]], including Wilde and writers such as Synge and [[James Joyce|Joyce]] in a group that "elevate [[wikt:blarney|blarney]] (in the form of linguistic idealism) to aesthetic and philosophical distinction", noting that Terry Eagleton observes an even longer tradition that stretches "as far back in Irish thought as the ninth-century theology of [[John Scottus Eriugena]]" and "the fantastic hyperbole of the ancient sagas".  Wilde's antimimetic idealism, specifically, McGrath describes to be part of the late nineteenth century debate between [[Romanticism]] and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]].&lt;ref name=McGrath1999 /&gt; Wilde's antimimetic philosophy has also had influence on later Irish writers, including [[Brian Friel]].

Halliwell asserts that the idea that life imitates art derives from classical notions that can be traced as far back as the writings of [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], and does not negate mimesis but rather "displace[s] its purpose onto the artlike fashioning of life itself".  Halliwell draws a parallel between Wilde's philosophy and Aristophanes' famous question about the comedies written by [[Menander]]: "O Menander and Life!  Which of you took the other as your model?", noting, however, that Aristophanes was a precursor to Wilde, and not necessarily espousing the positions that Wilde was later to propound.&lt;ref name=Halliwell2002 /&gt;

In [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s preface to ''[[Three Plays for Puritans|Three Plays]]'' he wrote, "I have noticed that when a certain type of feature appears in painting and is admired as beautiful, it presently becomes common in nature; so that the Beatrices and Francescas in the picture galleries of one generation come to life as the parlor-maids and waitresses of the next." He stated that he created the aristocratic characters in [[Cashel Byron's Profession]] as unrealistically [[wikt:priggish|priggish]] even without his later understanding that "the real world does not exist...men and women are made by their own fancies in the image of the imaginary creatures in my youthful fictions, only much stupider." Shaw, however, disagreed with Wilde on some points. He considered most attempts by life to imitate art to be reprehensible, in part because the art that people generally chose to imitate was idealistic and romanticized.&lt;ref name=Adams1971 /&gt;

The '''many-worlds interpretation''' is an [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] that asserts the [[Philosophical realism|objective reality]] of the [[universal wavefunction]] and denies the actuality of [[wavefunction collapse]]. Many-worlds implies that all [[probability|possible]] alternate histories and futures are real, each representing an actual "world" (or "universe").

The theory is also referred to as '''MWI''', the '''relative state formulation''', the '''Everett interpretation''', the '''theory of the universal wavefunction''', '''many-universes interpretation''',  '''multiverse theory''' or just '''many-worlds'''.

The original relative state formulation is due to [[Hugh Everett III|Hugh Everett]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=everett56&gt;[[Hugh Everett]] [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/manyworlds/pdf/dissertation.pdf Theory of the Universal Wavefunction], Thesis, Princeton University, (1956, 1973), pp 1–140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=everett57&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Everett | first1 = Hugh | authorlink = Hugh Everett | year = 1957 | title = Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics | url = http://www.univer.omsk.su/omsk/Sci/Everett/paper1957.html | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 454–462 | bibcode = 1957RvMP...29..454E | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.29.454 | access-date = 2011-10-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111027191052/http://www.univer.omsk.su/omsk/Sci/Everett/paper1957.html | archive-date = 2011-10-27 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, this formulation was popularized and renamed ''many-worlds'' by [[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]] in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=dewitt71&gt;[[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], Quantum Mechanics and Reality: Could the solution to the dilemma of indeterminism be a universe in which all possible outcomes of an experiment actually occur?, ''Physics Today'', 23(9) pp 30–40 (September 1970) "every quantum transition taking place on every star, in every galaxy, in every remote corner of the universe is splitting our local world on earth into myriads of copies of itself."

Before many-worlds, reality had always been viewed as a single unfolding history. Many-worlds, however, views historical reality as a many-branched tree, wherein every possible quantum outcome is realised.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Deutsch]] argues that a great deal of fiction is close to a fact somewhere in the so called [[multiverse]], ''Beginning of Infinity'', p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Many-worlds reconciles the observation of non-[[Determinism|deterministic]] events, such as [[Radioactive decay|random radioactive decay]], with the fully deterministic [[partial differential equations|equations]] of [[quantum physics]].

In many-worlds, the [[Phenomenalism|subjective appearance]] of wavefunction collapse is explained by the mechanism of [[quantum decoherence]], and this is supposed to resolve all of the [[quantum paradox|correlation paradoxes]] of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], such as the [[EPR paradox]]&lt;ref name=dewitt73paradox&gt;[[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], [[R.

==Origin==
In Dublin in 1952 [[Erwin Schrödinger]] gave a lecture in which at one point he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say might "seem lunatic". He went on to assert that what the [[Schrödinger equation|equation]] that won him a Nobel prize seems to be describing is several different histories, they are "not alternatives but all really happen simultaneously". This is the earliest known reference to the many-worlds.&lt;ref&gt;David Deutsch. The Beginning of infinity. Page 310.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9188438/Erwin-Schrodinger-and-the-Quantum-Revolution-by-John-Gribbin-review.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline==
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Hugh-Everett.jpg|188px|thumb|right|Hugh Everett III (1930–1982) was the first [[physicist]] who proposed the many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of [[quantum physics]], which he termed his "relative state" formulation.]] --&gt;
Although several versions of many-worlds have been proposed since [[Hugh Everett III|Hugh Everett]]'s original work,&lt;ref name=everett57/&gt; they all contain one key idea: the equations of physics that model the time evolution of systems ''without'' embedded observers are sufficient for modelling systems which ''do'' contain observers; in particular there is no observation-triggered [[wave function collapse]] which the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] proposes. Provided the theory is [[linear]] with respect to the wavefunction, the exact form of the [[quantum]] dynamics modelled, be it the non-relativistic [[Schrödinger equation]], [[relativistic quantum field theory]] or some form of [[quantum gravity]] or [[string theory]], does not alter the validity of MWI since MWI is a [[metatheory]] applicable to all linear [[quantum mechanics|quantum theories]], and there is no experimental evidence for any non-linearity of the wavefunction in physics.&lt;ref name="weinberglinearitydoft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weinberglinearityannalsop"/&gt; MWI's main conclusion is that the universe (or [[multiverse]] in this context) is composed of a [[quantum superposition]] of very many, possibly even [[Uncountable set|non-denumerably]] [[Infinity|infinitely]]&lt;ref name="Heresy"/&gt; many, increasingly divergent, non-communicating parallel universes or quantum worlds.&lt;ref name=dewitt73/&gt;

The idea of MWI originated in Everett's [[Princeton University|Princeton]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis "The Theory of the [[Universal Wavefunction]]",&lt;ref name=dewitt73/&gt; developed under his thesis advisor [[John Archibald Wheeler]], a shorter summary of which was published in 1957 entitled "Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics" (Wheeler contributed the title "relative state";&lt;ref name=wheeler&gt;[[John Archibald Wheeler]], ''Geons, Black Holes &amp; Quantum Foam'', {{ISBN|0-393-31991-1}}. pp 268–270&lt;/ref&gt; Everett originally called his approach the "Correlation Interpretation", where "correlation" refers to [[quantum entanglement]]). The phrase "many-worlds" is due to [[Bryce DeWitt]],&lt;ref name=dewitt73/&gt; who was responsible for the wider popularisation of Everett's theory, which had been largely ignored for the first decade after publication. DeWitt's phrase "many-worlds" has become so much more popular than Everett's "Universal Wavefunction" or Everett–Wheeler's "Relative State Formulation" that many forget that this is only a difference of terminology; the content of both of Everett's papers and DeWitt's popular article is the same.

The many-worlds interpretation shares many similarities with later, other "post-Everett" interpretations of quantum mechanics which also use [[decoherence]] to explain the process of measurement or wavefunction collapse. MWI treats the other histories or worlds as real since it regards the universal wavefunction as the "basic physical entity"&lt;ref name="reality wf57"&gt;Everett 1957, section 3, 2nd paragraph, 1st sentence&lt;/ref&gt; or "the fundamental entity, obeying at all times a deterministic wave equation".&lt;ref name="reality wf73"&gt;Everett [1956]1973, "Theory of the Universal Wavefunction", chapter 6 (e)&lt;/ref&gt; The other decoherent interpretations, such as [[consistent histories]], the [[Existential Interpretation]] etc., either regard the extra quantum worlds as metaphorical in some sense, or are [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] about their reality; it is sometimes hard to distinguish between the different varieties. MWI is distinguished by two qualities: it assumes [[philosophical realism|realism]],&lt;ref name="reality wf57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reality wf73"/&gt; which it assigns to the wavefunction, and it has the minimal formal structure possible, rejecting any [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]], [[quantum potential]], any form of a collapse postulate (i.e., [[Copenhagen Interpretation|Copenhagenism]]) or mental postulates (such as the [[many-minds interpretation]] makes).

Decoherent interpretations of many-worlds using [[einselection]] to explain how a small number of classical [[pointer state]]s can emerge from the enormous [[Hilbert space]] of superpositions have been proposed by [[Wojciech H. Zurek]]. "Under scrutiny of the environment, only pointer states remain unchanged. Other states decohere into mixtures of stable pointer states that can persist, and, in this sense, exist: They are einselected."&lt;ref name="ZurekNature2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zurek | first = Wojciech | authorlink = Wojciech Hubert Zurek | title = Quantum Darwinism | date = March 2009 | arxiv = 0903.5082 |bibcode = 2009NatPh...5..181Z |doi = 10.1038/nphys1202 | volume=5 | issue=3 | journal=Nature Physics | pages=181–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas complement MWI and bring the interpretation in line with our perception of reality.

Many-worlds is often referred to as a [[theory]], rather than just an interpretation, by those who propose that many-worlds can make testable predictions (such as [[David Deutsch]]) or is [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] (such as Everett) or by those who propose that all the other, non-MW interpretations, are inconsistent, illogical or unscientific in their handling of measurements; [[Hugh Everett]] argued that his formulation was a [[metatheory]], since it made statements about other interpretations of quantum theory; that it was the "only completely coherent approach to explaining both the contents of quantum mechanics and the appearance of the world."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/everett/ Everett&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch is dismissive that many-worlds is an "interpretation", saying that calling it an interpretation "is like talking about dinosaurs as an 'interpretation' of fossil records."&lt;ref name="MAD"/&gt;

==Interpreting wavefunction collapse==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
As with the other interpretations of quantum mechanics, the many-worlds interpretation is motivated by behavior that can be illustrated by the [[double-slit experiment]]. When [[photon|particles of light]] (or anything else) are passed through the double slit, a calculation assuming wave-like behavior of light can be used to identify where the particles are likely to be observed. Yet when the particles are observed in this experiment, they appear as particles (i.e., at definite places) and not as non-localized waves.

Some versions of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics proposed a process of "[[wavefunction collapse|collapse]]" in which an indeterminate quantum system would probabilistically collapse down onto, or select, just one determinate outcome to "explain" this phenomenon of observation. Wavefunction collapse was widely regarded as artificial and ''[[ad hoc]]''{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}, so an alternative interpretation in which the behavior of measurement could be understood from more fundamental physical principles was considered desirable.

Everett's Ph.D. work provided such an alternative interpretation. Everett stated that for a composite system &amp;ndash; for example a subject (the "observer" or measuring apparatus) observing an object (the "observed" system, such as a particle) &amp;ndash; the statement that either the observer or the observed has a well-defined state is meaningless; in modern parlance, the observer and the observed have become [[quantum entanglement|entangled]]; we can only specify the state of one ''relative'' to the other, i.e., the state of the observer and the observed are correlated ''after'' the observation is made. This led Everett to derive from the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone (i.e., without assuming wavefunction collapse) the notion of a ''relativity of states''.

Everett noticed that the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone decreed that after an observation is made each element of the [[quantum superposition]] of the combined subject–object wavefunction contains two "relative states": a "collapsed" object state and an associated observer who has observed the same collapsed outcome; what the observer sees and the state of the object have become correlated by the act of measurement or observation. The subsequent evolution of each pair of relative subject–object states proceeds with complete indifference as to the presence or absence of the other elements, ''as if'' wavefunction collapse has occurred, which has the consequence that later observations are always consistent with the earlier observations. Thus the ''appearance'' of the object's wavefunction's collapse has emerged from the unitary, deterministic theory itself. (This answered Einstein's early criticism of quantum theory, that the theory should define what is observed, not for the observables to define the theory).&lt;ref name="einstein26"&gt;"Whether you can observe a thing or not depends on the theory which you use. It is the theory which decides what can be observed." [[Albert Einstein]] to [[Werner Heisenberg]], objecting to placing observables at the heart of the new quantum mechanics, during Heisenberg's 1926 lecture at Berlin; related by Heisenberg in 1968, quoted by [[Abdus Salam]], ''Unification of Fundamental Forces'', Cambridge University Press (1990) {{ISBN|0-521-37140-6}}, pp 98–101&lt;/ref&gt; Since the wavefunction merely appears to have collapsed then, Everett reasoned, there was no need to actually assume that it had collapsed. And so, invoking [[Occam's razor]], he removed the postulate of wavefunction collapse from the theory.

==The unreal/real interpretation==

According to [[Martin Gardner]], the "other" worlds of MWI have two different interpretations: real or unreal; he claims that [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Steven Weinberg]] both favour the unreal interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071021033103/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_3_26/ai_85932634 A response to Bryce DeWitt], Martin Gardner, May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner also claims that the nonreal interpretation is favoured by the majority of physicists, whereas the "realist" view is only supported by MWI experts such as Deutsch and [[Bryce DeWitt]]. Hawking has said that "according to Feynman's idea", all the other histories are as "equally real" as our own,&lt;ref name="hawkingreal"&gt;Award winning 1995 Channel 4 documentary "Reality on the rocks: Beyond our Ken" {{cite web|url=http://www.windfallfilms.com/html/awards.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022030220/http://www.windfallfilms.com/html/awards.htm |archivedate=2007-10-22 |df= }} where, in response to [[Ken Campbell]]'s question "all these trillions of Universes of the Multiverse, are they as real as this one seems to be to me?" Hawking states, "Yes.... According to Feynman's idea, every possible history (of Ken) is equally real."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Gardner]] reports Hawking saying that MWI is "trivially true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gardner | first = Martin | authorlink = Martin Gardner | title = Are universes thicker than blackberries? | publisher = W.W. Norton | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-393-05742-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z9jH9mYiO5IC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10 | page = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1983 interview, Hawking also said he regarded the MWI as "self-evidently correct" but was dismissive towards questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying, "When I hear of [[Schrödinger's cat]], [[Hanns Johst#Schlageter|I reach for my gun]]." In the same interview, he also said, "But, look: All that one does, really, is to calculate conditional probabilities—in other words, the probability of A happening, given B. I think that that's all the many worlds interpretation is. Some people overlay it with a lot of mysticism about the wave function splitting into different parts. But all that you're calculating is conditional probabilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ferris | first = Timothy | authorlink = Timothy Ferris | title = The Whole Shebang | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | year= 1997 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=qjYbQ7EBAKwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA345#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 345] | isbn = 978-0-684-81020-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere Hawking contrasted his attitude towards the "reality" of physical theories with that of his colleague [[Roger Penrose]], saying, "He's a [[Platonic realism|Platonist]] and I'm a [[Positivism|positivist]]. He's worried that Schrödinger's cat is in a quantum state, where it is half alive and half dead. He feels that can't correspond to reality. But that doesn't bother me. I don't demand that a theory correspond to reality because I don't know what it is. Reality is not a quality you can test with litmus paper. All I'm concerned with is that the theory should predict the results of measurements. Quantum theory does this very successfully."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hawking | first = Stephen |author2=Roger Penrose | title = The Nature of Space and Time | publisher = Princeton University Press | year= 1996 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=LstaQTXP65cC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 121] | isbn = 978-0-691-03791-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his own part, Penrose agrees with Hawking that QM applied to the universe implies MW, although he considers the current lack of a successful theory of [[quantum gravity]] negates the claimed universality of conventional QM.&lt;ref name="penrose"&gt;{{cite web|last=Penrose |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Penrose |title=Roger Penrose Looks Beyond the Classic-Quantum Dichotomy |publisher=Sciencewatch |date=August 1991 |url=http://www.sciencewatch.com/interviews/roger_penrose2.htm |accessdate=2007-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023063403/http://www.sciencewatch.com/interviews/roger_penrose2.htm |archivedate=2007-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarities with the de Broglie–Bohm interpretation===
Kim Joris Boström has proposed a non-relativistic quantum mechanical theory that combines elements of the de Broglie–Bohm mechanics and that of Everett’s many-‘worlds’. In particular, the unreal MW interpretation of Hawking and Weinberg is similar to the Bohmian concept of unreal empty branch ‘worlds’:

{{quote|The second issue with Bohmian mechanics may at first sight appear rather harmless, but which on a closer look develops considerable destructive power: the issue of empty branches. These are the components of the post-measurement state that do not guide any particles because they do not have the actual configuration ''q'' in their support. At first sight, the empty branches do not appear problematic but on the contrary very helpful as they enable the theory to explain unique outcomes of measurements. Also, they seem to explain why there is an effective “collapse of the wavefunction”, as in ordinary quantum mechanics. On a closer view, though, one must admit that these empty branches do not actually disappear. As the wavefunction is taken to describe a really existing field, all their branches really exist and will evolve forever by the Schrödinger dynamics, no matter how many of them will become empty in the course of the evolution. Every branch of the global wavefunction potentially describes a complete world which is, according to Bohm’s ontology, only a possible world that would be the actual world if only it were filled with particles, and which is in every respect identical to a corresponding world in Everett’s theory. Only one branch at a time is occupied by particles, thereby representing the actual world, while all other branches, though really existing as part of a really existing wavefunction, are empty and thus contain some sort of “zombie worlds” with planets, oceans, trees, cities, cars and people who talk like us and behave like us, but who do not actually exist. Now, if the Everettian theory may be accused of ontological extravagance, then Bohmian mechanics could be accused of ontological wastefulness. On top of the ontology of empty branches comes the additional ontology of particle positions that are, on account of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis, forever unknown to the observer. Yet, the actual configuration is never needed for the calculation of the statistical predictions in experimental reality, for these can be obtained by mere wavefunction algebra. From this perspective, Bohmian mechanics may appear as a wasteful and redundant theory. I think it is considerations like these that are the biggest obstacle in the way of a general acceptance of Bohmian mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint=1208.5632|author1=Kim Joris Boström|title=Combining Bohm and Everett: Axiomatics for a Standalone Quantum Mechanics|class=quant-ph|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Probability===
Attempts have been made, by many-world advocates and others, over the years to ''derive'' the [[Born rule]], rather than just conventionally ''assume'' it, so as to reproduce all the required statistical behaviour associated with quantum mechanics. There is no consensus on whether this has been successful.&lt;ref&gt;N.P. Landsman, [http://www.math.ru.nl/~landsman/Born.pdf "The conclusion seems to be that no generally accepted derivation of the Born rule has been given to date, but this does not imply that such a derivation is impossible in principle."], in ''Compendium of Quantum Physics'' (eds.)

===Frequency-based approaches===
Everett (1957) briefly derived the Born rule by showing that the Born rule was the only possible rule, and that its derivation was as justified as the procedure for defining probability in [[classical mechanics]]. Everett stopped doing research in theoretical physics shortly after obtaining his Ph.D., but his work on probability has been extended by a number of people. [[Andrew Gleason]] (1957) and [[James Hartle]] (1965) independently reproduced Everett's work&lt;ref&gt;[[James Hartle]], Quantum Mechanics of Individual Systems, ''American Journal of Physics'', 1968, vol 36 (#8), pp. 704–712&lt;/ref&gt; which was later extended.&lt;ref&gt;E.

[[Bryce DeWitt]] and his doctoral student R. Neill Graham later provided alternative (and longer) derivations to Everett's derivation of the Born rule.&lt;ref name="dewitt73"/&gt; They demonstrated that the [[Normed vector space|norm]] of the worlds where the usual statistical rules of quantum theory broke down vanished, in the limit where the number of measurements went to infinity.

==MWI overview==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Many-worlds-bloch.png|thumb|400px|Schematic representation of pair of "smallest possible" quantum mechanical systems prior to interaction: Measured system '''S''' and measurement apparatus '''M'''. Systems such as '''S''' are referred to as 1-[[qubit]] systems.]] --&gt;
In Everett's formulation, a measuring apparatus '''M''' and an object system '''S''' form a composite system, each of which prior to measurement exists in well-defined (but time-dependent) states. Measurement is regarded as causing '''M''' and '''S''' to interact. After '''S''' interacts with '''M''', it is no longer possible to describe either system by an independent state. According to Everett, the only meaningful descriptions of each system are relative states: for example the relative state of '''S''' given the state of '''M''' or the relative state of '''M''' given the state of '''S'''. In DeWitt's formulation, the state of '''S''' after a sequence of measurements is given by a quantum superposition of states, each one corresponding to an alternative measurement history of '''S'''.

[[Image:Splittings-1.png|thumb|left|350px|Schematic illustration of splitting as a result of a repeated measurement.]]
For example, consider the smallest possible truly quantum system '''S''', as shown in the illustration. This describes for instance, the spin-state of an electron. Considering a specific axis (say the ''z''-axis) the north pole represents spin "up" and the south pole, spin "down". The superposition states of the system are described by (the surface of) a sphere called the [[Bloch sphere]]. To perform a measurement on '''S''', it is made to interact with another similar system '''M'''. After the interaction, the combined system is described by a state that ranges over a six-dimensional space (the reason for the number six is explained in the article on the Bloch sphere). This six-dimensional object can also be regarded as a quantum superposition of two "alternative histories" of the original system '''S''', one in which "up" was observed and the other in which "down" was observed. Each subsequent binary measurement (that is interaction with a system '''M''') causes a similar split in the history tree. Thus after three measurements, the system can be regarded as a quantum superposition of 8 = 2 × 2 × 2 copies of the original system '''S'''.

The accepted terminology is somewhat misleading because it is incorrect to regard the universe as splitting at certain times; at any given instant there is one state in one universe.

===Relative state===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
In his 1957 doctoral dissertation, Everett proposed that rather than modeling an isolated quantum system subject to external observation, one could mathematically model an object as well as its observers as purely physical systems within the mathematical framework developed by [[Paul Dirac]], [[von Neumann]] and others, discarding altogether the ''ad hoc'' mechanism of [[wave function collapse]].

Since Everett's original work, there have appeared a number of similar formalisms in the literature. One such is the relative state formulation. It makes two assumptions: first, the wavefunction is not simply a description of the object's state, but that it actually is entirely equivalent to the object, a claim it has in common with some other interpretations. Secondly, observation or measurement has no special laws or mechanics, unlike in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] which considers the wavefunction collapse as a special kind of event which occurs as a result of observation. Instead, measurement in the relative state formulation is the consequence of a configuration change in the memory of an observer described by the same basic wave physics as the object being modeled.

The many-worlds interpretation is DeWitt's popularisation of Everett's work, who had referred to the combined observer–object system as being split by an observation, each split corresponding to the different or multiple possible outcomes of an observation. These splits generate a possible tree as shown in the graphic below. Subsequently, DeWitt introduced the term "world" to describe a complete measurement history of an observer, which corresponds roughly to a single branch of that tree. Note that "splitting" in this sense is hardly new or even quantum mechanical. The idea of a space of complete alternative histories had already been used in the theory of probability since the mid-1930s for instance to model [[Brownian motion]]. [[Image:Many-worlds.svg|thumb|300px|Partial trace as relative state. Light blue rectangle on upper left denotes system in pure state. Trellis shaded rectangle in upper right denotes a (possibly) mixed state. Mixed state from observation is partial trace of a linear superposition of states as shown in lower right-hand corner.]][[Image:Paths-many-worlds.svg|thumb|right|300px|Successive measurements with successive splittings]]

Under the many-worlds interpretation, the [[Schrödinger equation]], or relativistic analog, holds all the time everywhere. An observation or measurement is modeled by applying the wave equation to the entire system comprising the observer ''and'' the object. One consequence is that every observation can be thought of as causing the combined observer–object's wavefunction to change into a quantum superposition of two or more non-interacting branches, or split into many "worlds". Since many observation-like events have happened and are constantly happening, there are an enormous and growing number of simultaneously existing states.

If a system is composed of two or more subsystems, the system's state will be a superposition of products of the subsystems' states. Each product of subsystem states in the overall superposition evolves over time independently of other products. Once the subsystems interact, their states have become correlated or [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] and it is no longer possible to consider them independent of one another. In Everett's terminology each subsystem state was now ''correlated'' with its ''relative state'', since each subsystem must now be considered relative to the other subsystems with which it has interacted.

===Properties of the theory===

MWI removes the observer-dependent role in the [[quantum measurement]] process by replacing [[wavefunction collapse]] with [[quantum decoherence]]. Since the role of the observer lies at the heart of most if not all "quantum paradoxes," this automatically resolves a number of problems; see for example [[Schrödinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]], the [[EPR paradox]], [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]'s "boundary problem" and even [[wave-particle duality]]. [[Quantum cosmology]] also becomes intelligible, since there is no need anymore for an observer outside of the universe.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

MWI is a [[philosophical realism|realist]], [[deterministic]], arguably [[local realism|local]] theory, akin to [[classical physics]] (including the [[theory of relativity]]), at the expense of losing [[counterfactual definiteness]]. MWI achieves this by removing [[wavefunction collapse]], which is indeterministic and non-local, from the [[deterministic]] and [[local realism|local]] equations of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].&lt;ref name=rubinlocality&gt;[[Mark A. Rubin]], Locality in the Everett Interpretation of Heisenberg-Picture Quantum Mechanics, ''Foundations of Physics Letters'', 14, (2001) , pp.&amp;nbsp;301–322, {{arxiv|quant-ph/0103079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MWI (or other, broader [[multiverse]] considerations) provides a context for the [[anthropic principle]] which may provide an explanation for the [[fine-tuned universe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul C.W. Davies]], ''Other Worlds'', chapters 8 &amp; 9 ''The Anthropic Principle'' &amp; ''Is the Universe an accident?'', (1980) {{ISBN|0-460-04400-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul C.W. Davies]], ''The Accidental Universe'', (1982) {{ISBN|0-521-28692-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MWI, being a [[quantum decoherence|decoherent]] formulation, is axiomatically more streamlined than the [[Copenhagen Interpretation|Copenhagen]] and other [[wavefunction collapse|collapse]] interpretations; and thus favoured under certain interpretations of [[Occam's razor]].&lt;ref name="FAQ occam"/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2013}} Of course there are other decoherent interpretations that also possess this advantage with respect to the collapse interpretations.

===Comparative properties and possible experimental tests===
One of the salient properties of the many-worlds interpretation is that it does not require an exceptional method of wave function collapse to explain it. "It seems that there is no experiment distinguishing the MWI from other no-collapse theories such as [[Bohmian mechanics]] or other variants of MWI... In most no-collapse interpretations, the evolution of the quantum state of the Universe is the same. Still, one might imagine that there is an experiment distinguishing the MWI from another no-collapse interpretation based on the difference in the correspondence between the formalism and the experience (the results of experiments)."&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web |last=Vaidman |first=Lev |title=Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/ |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1985, David Deutsch published three related thought experiments which could test the theory vs the Copenhagen interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, D., (1986) 'Three experimental implications of the Everett interpretation', in R. Penrose and C.J. Isham (eds.), Quantum Concepts of Space and Time, Oxford: The Clarendon Press, pp. 204–214.&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments require macroscopic quantum state preparation and [[quantum erasure]] by a hypothetical quantum computer which is currently outside experimental possibility. Since then Lockwood (1989), Vaidman and others have made similar proposals.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; These proposals also require an advanced technology which is able to place a macroscopic object in a coherent superposition, another task which it is uncertain will ever be possible to perform. Many other controversial ideas have been put forward though, such as a recent claim that cosmological observations could test the theory,&lt;ref&gt;Page, D., (2000) '[http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/0001001 Can Quantum Cosmology Give Observational Consequences of Many-Worlds Quantum Theory?]'&lt;/ref&gt; and another claim by Rainer Plaga (1997), published in ''[[Foundations of Physics]]'', that communication might be possible between worlds.&lt;ref name="plaga"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Plaga | first1 = R. | year = 1997 | title =  On a possibility to find experimental evidence for the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics| url = | journal = Foundations of Physics | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 559–577 |arxiv = quant-ph/9510007 |bibcode = 1997FoPh...27..559P |doi = 10.1007/BF02550677 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copenhagen interpretation===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
In the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], the mathematics of quantum mechanics allows one to predict [[probability|probabilities]] for the occurrence of various events. When an event occurs, it becomes part of the definite reality, and alternative possibilities do not. There is no necessity to say anything definite about what is not observed.

===The universe decaying to a new vacuum state===
Any event that changes the number of observers in the universe may have experimental consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Page, Don N. |doi=10.1063/1.1301589 |title=Can Quantum Cosmology Give Observational Consequences of Many-Worlds Quantum Theory? |year=2000|arxiv = gr-qc/0001001 |journal=Eighth Canadian conference on general relativity and relativistic astrophysics|volume=493 |pages=225 |isbn=156396905X |bibcode=1999AIPC..493..225P }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum tunnelling]] to a new [[vacuum state]] would reduce the number of observers to zero (i.e., kill all life).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Some [[Physical cosmology|cosmologists]]{{citation needed|reason=Who?|date=March 2015}} argue that the [[universe]] is in a [[False vacuum|false vacuum state]] and that consequently the universe should have already experienced quantum tunnelling to a true vacuum state. This has not happened and is cited as evidence in favor of many-worlds. In some worlds, quantum tunnelling to a true vacuum state has happened but most other worlds escape this tunneling and remain viable. This can be thought of as a variation on [[Quantum suicide and immortality|quantum suicide]].

===Many-minds===
{{Main|Many-minds interpretation}}
The ''many-minds'' interpretation is a multi-world interpretation that defines the splitting of reality on the level of the observers' minds.  In this, it differs from Everett's many-worlds interpretation, in which there is no special role for the observer's mind.&lt;ref name="plaga" /&gt;

==Common objections==
The many-worlds interpretation is very vague about the ways to determine when splitting happens, and nowadays usually the criterion is that the two branches have [[Quantum decoherence|decohered]]. However, present day understanding of decoherence does not allow a completely precise, self-contained way to say when the two branches have decohered/"do not interact", and hence many-worlds interpretation remains arbitrary. This objection is saying that it is not clear what is precisely meant by branching, and point to the lack of self-contained criteria specifying branching.
::MWI response: the decoherence or "splitting" or "branching" is complete when the [[quantum measurement|measurement]] is complete. In [[Bra–ket notation|Dirac notation]] a measurement is complete when:
:::&lt;math&gt;\lang O_i|O_j\rang = \delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=dewitt71ortho&gt;[[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], Quantum Mechanics and Reality: Could the solution to the dilemma of indeterminism be a universe in which all possible outcomes of an experiment actually occur?, ''Physics Today'', 23(9) pp 30–40 (September 1970); see equation 10&lt;/ref&gt;
::where &lt;math&gt;O_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the observer having detected the object system in the ''i''th state. Before the measurement has started the observer states are identical; after the measurement is complete the observer states are [[Orthonormality|orthonormal]].&lt;ref name=everett57/&gt;&lt;ref name=dewitt73/&gt; Thus a measurement defines the branching process: the branching is as well- or ill-defined as the measurement is; the branching is as complete as the measurement is complete – which is to say that the delta function above represents an idealised measurement. Although true "for all practical purposes" in reality the measurement, and hence the branching, is never fully complete, since delta functions are unphysical,&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, R. ''The Road to Reality'', §21.11&lt;/ref&gt;
::Since the role of the observer and measurement per se plays no special role in MWI (measurements are handled as all other interactions are) there is no need for a precise definition of what an observer or a measurement is — just as in [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]] no precise definition of either an observer or a measurement was required or expected. In all circumstances the [[universal wavefunction]] is still available to give a complete description of reality.
::Also, it is a common misconception to think that branches are completely separate. In Everett's formulation, they may in principle [[Quantum interference|quantum interfere]] (i.e., "merge" instead of "splitting") with each other in the future,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/9709032|last1=Tegmark|first1=Max|title=The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: Many Worlds or Many Words?|journal=Fortschritte der Physik|volume=46|issue=6–8|pages=855–862|year=1997|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3978(199811)46:6/8&lt;855::AID-PROP855&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q}}. To quote: "What Everett does NOT postulate: ''"At certain magic instances, the world undergoes some sort of metaphysical 'split' into two branches that subsequently never interact."'' This is not only a misrepresentation of the MWI, but also inconsistent with the Everett postulate, since the subsequent time evolution could in principle make the two terms...interfere. According to the MWI, there is, was and always will be only one wavefunction, and only decoherence calculations, not postulates, can tell us when it is a good approximation to treat two terms as non-interacting."&lt;/ref&gt; although this requires all "memory" of the earlier branching event to be lost, so no observer ever sees two branches of reality.&lt;ref name="davis86"/&gt;&lt;ref name=csimon&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=0908.0322|last1=Simon|first1=Christoph|title=Conscious observers clarify many worlds|class=quant-ph|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MWI states that there is no special role, or need for precise definition of measurement in MWI, yet Everett uses the word "measurement" repeatedly throughout its exposition.
::MWI response: "measurements" are treated as a subclass of interactions, which induce subject–object correlations in the combined wavefunction. There is nothing special about measurements (such as the ability to trigger a [[wave function collapse]]), that cannot be dealt with by the usual [[Unitarity (physics)|unitary]] time development process.&lt;ref name=everett56/&gt; This is why there is no precise definition of measurement in Everett's formulation, although some other formulations emphasize that measurements must be effectively irreversible or create classical information.

The splitting of worlds forward in time, but not backwards in time (i.e., merging worlds), is time asymmetric and incompatible with the time symmetric nature of [[Schrödinger's equation]], or [[CPT invariance]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Gerver, The past as backward movies of the future, ''Physics Today'', letters followup, 24(4), (April 1971), pp 46–7&lt;/ref&gt;
::MWI response: The splitting is time asymmetric; this observed temporal asymmetry is due to the [[boundary conditions]] imposed by the [[Big Bang]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], ''Physics Today'', letters followup, 24(4), (April 1971), pp 43&lt;/ref&gt;

There is circularity in Everett's measurement theory. Under the assumptions made by Everett, there are no 'good observations' as defined by him, and since his analysis of the observational process depends on the latter, it is void of any meaning. The concept of a 'good observation' is the [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]] postulate in disguise and Everett's analysis simply derives this postulate by having assumed it, without any discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~neum/manyworlds.txt Arnold Neumaier's comments on the Everett FAQ, 1999 &amp; 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2013}}

We cannot be sure that the universe is a quantum multiverse until we have a [[theory of everything]] and, in particular, a successful theory of [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref name="penrose"/&gt; If the final theory of everything is non-[[linear]] with respect to [[wave function|wavefunctions]] then many-worlds would be invalid.&lt;ref name="dewitt71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="everett57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dewitt67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dewitt72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dewitt73"/&gt;

[[Conservation of energy]] is grossly violated if at every instant near-infinite amounts of new matter are generated to create the new universes.
::MWI response: There are two responses to this objection. First, the law of conservation of energy says that energy is conserved ''within each universe''. Hence, even if "new matter" were being generated to create new universes, this would not violate conservation of energy. Second, conservation of energy is not violated since the energy of each branch has to be weighted by its probability, according to the standard formula for the [[Conservation of energy#Quantum theory|conservation of energy in quantum theory]]. This results in the total energy of the multiverse being conserved.&lt;ref name="FAQ energy conservation"&gt;[http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#conservation Everett FAQ "Does many-worlds violate conservation of energy?"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2013}}

[[Occam's razor]] rules against a plethora of unobservable universes – Occam would prefer just one universe; i.e., any non-MWI.
::MWI response: Occam's razor actually is a constraint on the complexity of physical theory, not on the number of universes. MWI is a simpler theory since it has fewer postulates.&lt;ref name="FAQ occam"&gt;[http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#ockham's Everett FAQ "Does many-worlds violate Ockham's Razor?"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2013}} Occams's razor is often cited by MWI adherents as an advantage of MWI.

Unphysical universes: If a state is a superposition of two states &lt;math&gt;\Psi_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Psi_B&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\Psi = (a \Psi_A + b \Psi_B)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., weighted by coefficients ''a'' and ''b'', then if &lt;math&gt;b \ll a&lt;/math&gt;, what principle allows a universe with vanishingly small probability ''b'' to be instantiated on an equal footing with the much more probable one with probability ''a''? This seems to throw away the information in the probability amplitudes.
::MWI response: The magnitude of the coefficients provides the weighting that makes the branches or universes "unequal", as Everett and others have shown, leading the emergence of the [[Born rule|conventional probabilistic rules]].&lt;ref name="dewitt71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="everett57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dewitt67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dewitt72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dewitt73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAQ probability"&gt;[http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#probabilities Everett FAQ "How do probabilities emerge within many-worlds?"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2013}}

Violation of the [[principle of locality]], which contradicts [[special relativity]]: MWI splitting is instant and total: this may conflict with relativity, since an alien in the Andromeda galaxy can't know I collapse an electron over here before she collapses hers there: the relativity of [[simultaneity]] says we can't say which electron collapsed first – so which one splits off another universe first? This leads to a hopeless muddle with everyone splitting differently. Note: [[EPR paradox|EPR]] is not a get-out here, as the alien's and my electrons need never have been part of the same quantum, i.e., [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]].
::MWI response: the splitting can be regarded as causal, local and relativistic, spreading at, or below, the speed of light (e.g., we are not split by [[Schrödinger's cat]] until we look in the box).&lt;ref name="FAQ splithow"&gt;[http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#splitsh Everett FAQ "When does Schrodinger's cat split?"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2013}} For [[spacelike]] separated splitting you can't say which occurred first — but this is true of all spacelike separated events, [[simultaneity]] is not defined for them. Splitting is no exception; many-worlds is a local theory.&lt;ref name=rubinlocality/&gt;

==Reception==
There is a wide range of claims that are considered "many-worlds" interpretations. It was often claimed by those who do not believe in MWI&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey A. Barrett]], ''The Quantum Mechanics of Minds and Worlds'', Oxford University Press, 1999. According to Barrett (loc. cit. Chapter 6) "There are many many-worlds interpretations."&lt;/ref&gt; that Everett himself was not entirely clear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Barrett |first=Jeffrey A. |title=Everett's Relative-State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/qm-everett/ |year=2010 |edition=Fall 2010}} Again, according to Barrett "It is... unclear precisely how this was supposed to work."&lt;/ref&gt; as to what he believed; however, MWI adherents (such as [[Bryce DeWitt|DeWitt]], [[Max Tegmark|Tegmark]], [[David Deutsch|Deutsch]] and others) believe they fully understand Everett's meaning as implying the literal existence of the other worlds. Additionally, recent biographical sources make it clear that Everett believed in the literal reality of the other quantum worlds.&lt;ref name="MAD"&gt;Peter Byrne, [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0199552274 The Many Worlds of Hugh Everett III: Multiple Universes, Mutual Assured Destruction, and the Meltdown of a Nuclear Family], {{ISBN|978-0-19-955227-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Oliver Everett|Everett's son]] reported that Hugh Everett "never wavered in his belief over his many-worlds theory".&lt;ref name="newsciMark"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Aldhous | first = Peter | title = Parallel lives can never touch | magazine = New Scientist | issue = 2631 |date=2007-11-24 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626311.800-interview-parallel-lives-can-never-touch.html | accessdate = 2007-11-21 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also Everett was reported to believe "his many-worlds theory guaranteed him [[Quantum suicide and immortality|immortality]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/everett/everett.html#e23 Eugene Shikhovtsev's Biography of Everett, in particular see "''Keith Lynch remembers 1979–1980''"]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of MWI's strongest advocates is [[David Deutsch]].&lt;ref name="deutsch98"&gt;[[David Deutsch]], ''The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes And Its Implications'', Penguin Books (1998), {{ISBN|0-14-027541-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Deutsch, the single photon interference pattern observed in the [[double slit experiment]] can be explained by interference of photons in multiple universes. Viewed in this way, the single photon interference experiment is indistinguishable from the multiple photon interference experiment. In a more practical vein, in one of the earliest papers on quantum computing,&lt;ref name="deutsch85"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = David | authorlink = David Deutsch | year = 1985 | title = Quantum theory, the Church–Turing principle and the universal quantum computer | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A | volume = 400 | issue = 1818| pages = 97–117 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1985.0070|bibcode = 1985RSPSA.400...97D | citeseerx = 10.1.1.144.7936 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he suggested that parallelism that results from the validity of MWI could lead to "''a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it''". Deutsch has also proposed that when [[Reversible computing|reversible computers]] become conscious then MWI will be testable (at least against "naive" Copenhagenism) via the reversible observation of spin.&lt;ref name="davis86"&gt;[[Paul C.W. Davies]], J.R. Brown, ''The Ghost in the Atom'' (1986) {{ISBN|0-521-31316-3}}, pp. 34–38: "The Many-Universes Interpretation", pp 83–105 for [[David Deutsch]]'s test of MWI and reversible quantum memories&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asher Peres]] was an outspoken critic of MWI.  For example, a section in his 1993 textbook had the title ''Everett's interpretation and other bizarre theories''. Peres not only questioned whether MWI is really an "interpretation", but rather, if ''any'' interpretations of quantum mechanics are needed at all. An interpretation can be regarded as a purely formal transformation, which adds nothing to the rules of the [[quantum mechanics]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Peres seems to suggest{{according to whom|date=January 2016}} that positing the existence of an infinite number of non-communicating [[Multiverse|parallel universes]] is highly suspect per those{{who|date=January 2016}} who interpret it as a violation of [[Occam's razor]], i.e., that it does not minimize the number of hypothesized entities. However, it is understood{{by whom|date=January 2016}} that the number of elementary particles are not a gross violation of Occam's razor, one counts the types, not the tokens. [[Max Tegmark]] remarks{{where|date=January 2016}} that the alternative to many-worlds is "many words", an [[allusion]] to the complexity of [[von Neumann]]'s collapse postulate. On the other hand, the same derogatory qualification "many words" is often applied to MWI by its critics{{who|date=January 2016}} who see it as a word game which obfuscates rather than clarifies by confounding the von Neumann branching of possible worlds with the Schrödinger parallelism of many worlds in superposition.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

MWI is considered by some{{who|date=January 2016}} to be [[unfalsifiable]] and hence unscientific because the multiple [[Multiverse|parallel universes]] are non-communicating, in the sense that no information can be passed between them. Others&lt;ref name="davis86"/&gt; claim MWI is directly testable. Everett regarded MWI as falsifiable since any test that falsifies conventional [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] would also falsify MWI.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

=== Polls ===
Advocates of MWI often cite a poll of 72 "leading [[cosmologist]]s and other quantum field theorists" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=35–36 |title= The Universe – Solved! |first= Jim |last= Elvridge. |isbn= 978-1-4243-3626-5 |date= 2008-01-02 |oclc= 247614399 |quote= 58% believed that the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) was true, including Stephen Hawking and Nobel Laureates [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and Richard Feynman }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by the American political scientist [[David Raub]] in 1995 showing 58% agreement with "Yes, I think MWI is true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote= [the poll was] published in the French periodical ''Sciences et Avenir'' in January 1998 |page= 33 |title= Beyond the bleep : the definitive unauthorized guide to What the bleep do we know!? |first= Alexandra |last= Bruce. |isbn= 978-1-932857-22-1 |chapter= How does reality work?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the poll is controversial. For example, [[Victor J. Stenger]] remarks that [[Murray Gell-Mann]]'s published work explicitly rejects the existence of simultaneous parallel universes. Collaborating with [[James Hartle]], Gell-Mann is working toward the development a more "palatable" ''post-Everett quantum mechanics''. Stenger thinks it's fair to say that most physicists dismiss the many-world interpretation as too extreme, while noting it "has merit in finding a place for the observer inside the system being analyzed and doing away with the troublesome notion of wave function collapse".&lt;ref name="stenger1995"&gt;{{cite book |first=V.J. |last=Stenger |year=1995 |title=The Unconscious Quantum: Metaphysics in Modern Physics and Cosmology |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-57392-022-3 |lccn=lc95032599 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZbvAAAAMAAJ |page=176 |quote=Gell-Mann and collaborator James Hartle, along with a score of others, have been working to develop a more palatable interpretation of quantum mechanics that is free of the problems that plague all the interpretations we have considered so far. This new interpretation is called, in its various incarnations, '''post-Everett quantum mechanics''', alternate histories, consistent histories, or decoherent histories. I will not be overly concerned with the detailed differences between these characterizations and will use the terms more or less interchangeably.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Tegmark]] also reports the result of a "highly unscientific" poll taken at a 1997 quantum mechanics workshop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/quantum.html Max Tegmark on many-worlds (contains MWI poll)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tegmark, "The many worlds interpretation (MWI) scored second, comfortably ahead of the [[consistent histories]] and [[Bohm interpretation|Bohm&amp;nbsp;interpretations]]." Such polls have been taken at other conferences, for example, in response to [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]]'s observation, "As crazy as it sounds, most working physicists buy into the many-worlds theory" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://preposterousuniverse.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_preposterousuniverse_archive.html#108087902367974365 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040908014703/http://preposterousuniverse.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_preposterousuniverse_archive.html#108087902367974365 |first=Sean |last=Caroll |title=Preposterous Universe |date=1 April 2004 |archivedate=8 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Nielsen]] counters: "at a quantum computing conference at Cambridge in 1998, a many-worlder surveyed the audience of approximately 200 people... Many-worlds did just fine, garnering support on a level comparable to, but somewhat below, Copenhagen and decoherence." However, Nielsen notes that it seemed most attendees found it to be a waste of time: [[Asher Peres]] "got a huge and sustained round of applause… when he got up at the end of the polling and asked 'And who here believes the laws of physics are decided by a democratic vote?'" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qinfo.org/people/nielsen/blog/archive/000060.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040520222807/http://www.qinfo.org/people/nielsen/blog/archive/000060.html |first=Michael |last=Nielsen |title=Michael Nielsen: The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics | archivedate=20 May 2004 |date=3 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 poll of fewer than 40 students and researchers taken after a course on the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics at the Institute for Quantum Computing University of Waterloo found "Many Worlds (and decoherence)" to be the least favored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iqc.ca/~qipcourse/interpret/survey.html Survey Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104152717/http://www.iqc.ca/~qipcourse/interpret/survey.html |date=2010-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 poll of 33 participants at an Austrian conference found 6 endorsed MWI, 8 "Information-based/information-theoretical", and 14 Copenhagen;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1301.1069|last1=Schlosshauer|first1=Maximilian|title=A Snapshot of Foundational Attitudes Toward Quantum Mechanics|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|volume=44|issue=3|pages=222–230|last2=Kofler|first2=Johannes|last3=Zeilinger|first3=Anton|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2013.04.004|bibcode=2013SHPMP..44..222S}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors remark that the results are similar to the previous Tegmark's 1998 poll.

==Speculative implications==
Speculative physics deals with questions which are also discussed in science fiction.

===Quantum suicide thought experiment===
{{main|Quantum suicide and immortality}}
'''Quantum suicide''', as a [[thought experiment]], was published independently by [[Hans Moravec]] in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestargarden.co.uk/ManyMinds.html |title=The Many Minds Approach |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=7 December 2010 |quote=This idea was first proposed by Austrian mathematician Hans Moravec in 1987...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moravec1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moravec |first=Hans |year=1988 |title=Mind Children: The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence |chapter=The Doomsday Device |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Harvard |page=188 |isbn=978-0-674-57618-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=56mb7XuSx3QC&amp;lpg=PP188&amp;pg=PA188}} (If MWI is true, apocalyptic particle accelerators won't function as advertised).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruno Marchal]] in 1988&lt;ref name="Marchal1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marchal |first=Bruno |year=1988 |title=Informatique théorique et philosophie de l'esprit |journal=Acte du 3ème colloque international Cognition et Connaissance [Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference Cognition and Knowledge] |location=Toulouse |pages=193–227 |trans-title=Theoretical Computer Science and Philosophy of Mind}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marchal1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marchal |first=Bruno |year=1991 |title=Mechanism and personal identity |editor1-last=De Glas |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Gabbay |editor2-first=D. |journal=Proceedings of WOCFAI 91 |pages=335–345 |location=Paris.

'''Quantum immortality''' refers to the subjective experience of surviving quantum suicide regardless of the odds.&lt;ref name="mit_edu"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tegmark |first=Max |title=Quantum immortality |url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/quantum.html#immortality |date=November 1998 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weak coupling===
Another speculation is that the separate worlds remain weakly coupled (e.g., by gravity) permitting "communication between parallel universes". A possible test of this using quantum-optical equipment is described in a 1997 ''[[Foundations of Physics]]'' article by [[Rainer Plaga]].&lt;ref name="plaga"/&gt; It involves an isolated [[ion]] in an [[ion trap]], a quantum measurement that would yield two parallel worlds (their difference just being in the detection of a single photon), and the [[Excited state|excitation]] of the ion from only one of these worlds. If the excited ion can be detected from the other parallel universe, then this would constitute direct evidence in support of the many-worlds interpretation and would automatically exclude the orthodox, "logical", and "many-histories" interpretations. The reason the ion is isolated is to make it not participate immediately in the decoherence which insulates the parallel world branches, therefore allowing it to act as a gateway between the two worlds, and if the measure apparatus could perform the measurements quickly enough before the gateway ion is decoupled then the test would succeed (with electronic computers the necessary time window between the two worlds would be in a time scale of [[millisecond]]s or [[nanosecond]]s, and if the measurements are taken by humans then a few seconds would still be enough). R. Plaga shows that macroscopic decoherence timescales are a possibility. The proposed test is based on technical equipment described in a 1993 ''[[Physical Review]]'' article by Itano et al.&lt;ref name="itano"&gt;W.M.Itano et al., Phys. Rev. A47,3354 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; and R. Plaga says that this level of technology is enough to realize the proposed inter-world communication experiment. The necessary technology for precision measurements of single ions already exists since the 1970s, and the ion recommended for excitation is &lt;sup&gt;199&lt;/sup&gt;Hg&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The excitation methodology is described by Itano et al. and the time needed for it is given by the [[Rabi flopping]] formula.&lt;ref&gt;M. SargentIII, M. O. Scully and W. E. Lamb, Laser physics (Addison-Wesley, Reading, 1974), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a test as described by R. Plaga would mean that energy transfer is possible between parallel worlds. This does not violate the fundamental principles of physics because these require energy conservation only for the whole universe and not for the single parallel branches.&lt;ref name="plaga" /&gt; Neither the excitation of the single ion (which is a [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] of the proposed system) leads to decoherence, something which is proven by [[Welcher Weg]] detectors which can excite atoms without momentum transfer (which causes the loss of coherence).&lt;ref&gt;M.O. Scully and H. Walther, Phys. Rev. A 39,5229 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed test would allow for low-bandwidth inter-world communication, the limiting factors of bandwidth and time being dependent on the technology of the equipment. Because of the time needed to determine the state of the partially decohered isolated excited ion based on Itano et al.'s methodology, the ion would decohere by the time its state is determined during the experiment, so Plaga's proposal would pass just enough information between the two worlds to confirm their parallel existence and nothing more. The author contemplates that with increased bandwidth, one could even transfer television imagery across the parallel worlds.&lt;ref name="plaga" /&gt; For example, Itano et al.'s methodology could be improved (by lowering the time needed for state determination of the excited ion) if a more efficient process were found for the detection of fluorescence radiation using 194&amp;nbsp;nm photons.&lt;ref name="plaga" /&gt;

A 1991 article by J. Polchinski also supports the view that inter-world communication is a theoretical possibility.&lt;ref&gt;J. Polchinski, Phys. Rev. Lett. 66,397 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors in a 1994 preprint article also contemplated similar ideas.&lt;ref&gt;M. Gell-Mann and J. B. Hartle, Equivalent Sets of Histories and Multiple Quasiclassical Domains, preprint University of California at Santa Barbara UCSBTH-94-09 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason inter-world communication seems like a possibility is because [[decoherence]] which separates the parallel worlds is never fully complete,&lt;ref name="zeh16"&gt;H. D. Zeh, Found.Phys. 3,109 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. D. Zeh, Phys. Lett. A 172,189 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; therefore weak influences from one parallel world to another can still pass between them,&lt;ref name="zeh16" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Albrecht, Phys. Rev. D 48, 3768 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; and these should be measurable with advanced technology. Deutsch proposed such an experiment in a 1985 ''[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]]'' article,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=David|date=1985|title=Quantum theory as a universal physical theory|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00670071|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–41|doi=10.1007/bf00670071|issn=0020-7748|quote=The actual performance of this experiment, involving as it does fairly detailed adjustments inside an observer's brain and sense organs, is far beyond present-day technology, but perhaps not quite as far as it might seem at first sight.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the technology it requires involves human-level [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="plaga" /&gt;

===Absurd or highly improbable timelines===
Many MWI proponents assert that every physically possible event has to be represented in the multiversal stack, and by definition this would include highly unlikely scenarios and timelines.
Bryce Seligman DeWitt has stated that "[Everett, Wheeler and Graham] do not in the end exclude any element of the superposition. All the worlds are there, even those in which everything goes wrong and all the statistical laws break down." &lt;ref&gt;DeWitt, B (1970). "Quantum mechanics and reality".

White]]'s [[The Once and Future King]], Murray Gell-Mann describes the implications of his [[Totalitarian principle]], as "Everything not forbidden is compulsory."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, G. (1999).

Max Tegmark has affirmed in numerous statements that absurd or highly unlikely events are inevitable under the MWI interpretation. To quote Tegmark, "Things inconsistent with the laws of physics will never happen - everything else will... it's important to keep track of the statistics, since even if everything conceivable happens somewhere, really freak events happen only exponentially rarely".&lt;ref&gt;Max Tegmark: Q and A (Multiverse Philosophy) http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/crazy.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Frank J. Tipler]], although a strong advocate for the many-worlds interpretation, has expressed some skepticism regarding this aspect of the theory. In a 2015 interview he stated "We simply don't know...it might be that the modulus over the wavefunction of that possibility [i.e. an extremely absurd yet physically possible event] is zero in which case there is no such world...There are universes out there, which you could imagine which...would not be actualized." &lt;ref&gt;Audio interview with Frank Tipler- White Gardenia interview with Frank Tipler, December 2015

===Similarity to modal realism===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
The many-worlds interpretation has some similarity to [[modal realism]] in [[philosophy]], which is the view that the [[possible world]]s used to interpret modal claims exist and are of a kind with the actual world. Unlike the possible worlds of philosophy, however, in quantum mechanics counterfactual alternatives can influence the results of experiments, as in the [[Elitzur–Vaidman bomb-testing problem]] or the [[Quantum Zeno effect]]. Also, while the worlds of the many-worlds interpretation all share the same physical laws, modal realism postulates a world for every way things could conceivably have been.

===Time travel===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
The many-worlds interpretation could be one possible way to resolve the paradoxes&lt;ref name="deutsch98"/&gt; that one would expect to arise ''if'' [[time travel]] turns out to be permitted by physics (permitting [[closed timelike curves]] and thus violating [[causality]]). Entering the past would itself be a quantum event causing branching, and therefore the timeline accessed by the time traveller simply would be another timeline of many. In that sense, it would make the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]] unnecessary.

==Many-worlds in literature and science fiction==
{{Main|Parallel universe (fiction)}}
{{See also|Alternate History}}

''[[Star Trek]]'' uses many-worlds in many stories. In the ''[[Star Trek: Original Series|Original Series]]'', Spock and Kirk [[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|make a crossover into a mirror universe]] and encounter versions of themselves from the other universe. This [[Mirror Universe]] is continued in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space 9|Deep Space 9]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]],'' and ''[[Star Trek: Discovery|Discovery]]'', with episodes arching between the Terran empire and the Alliance, where characters find mirror versions of themselves and other characters who are currently dead in the central universe, or dead in the parallel universe. In [[Parallels (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|an episode]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', Worf crosses over into a parallel universe while piloting a shuttlecraft and manages to encounter several other universes. The TNG finale "[[All Good Things... (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|All Good Things...]]" uses the concept heavily, as Picard jumps between times. 

[[Michael Crichton]]'s 1999 novel, ''[[Timeline (novel)|Timeline]]'', is about time travel into the past. The technology used in the book is based upon the existence of the MWI's multiverse as described by Everett.&lt;ref&gt;The book erroneously attributes the phrase "many worlds" to Everett. 
 It was actually coined by [[Bryce DeWitt]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crichton2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Crichton|title=Timeline|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQL2n6NrQ_MC|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-345-53901-4|pages=121–123, 127-128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author [[Neal Stephenson]] drew on the many-worlds theory for some aspects of his 2008 novel ''[[Anathem]]''.

A more recent iteration, ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', uses the many-worlds interpretation as a basis for the occurrences in the show, with Rick using a portal gun to casually travel between timelines. The cartoon also makes an allusion to [[Schrödinger's Cat]] in an episode in which they split their existence into two hypothetical, equally possible existences.

In [[Stranger Things#Season 1 (2016)|episode 5]] of the [[Netflix]] series, ''[[Stranger Things]]'', the protagonists' middle school teacher Scott Clarke specifically mentions the many-worlds theory when asked about the possibility of "theoretical" alternate dimensions.

Many worlds interpretation was also used in [[The Time Ships]] by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="97850">'''Mental health''' is a level of [[psychological]] [[well-being]] or an absence of [[mental illness]]. It is the "psychological state of someone who is functioning at a satisfactory level of emotional and behavioural adjustment".&lt;ref name=Princeton&gt;{{cite web |title=mental health |website=WordNet Search |publisher=Princeton university |accessdate=4 May 2014 |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=mental+health&amp;sub=Search+WordNet }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of [[positive psychology]] or [[holism]], mental health may include an individual's ability to enjoy life, and create a balance between life activities and efforts to achieve [[psychological resilience]].
According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), mental health includes "subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, inter-generational dependence, and self-actualization of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others."&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2001/en/whr01_en.pdf?ua=1|title=The world health report 2001 – Mental Health: New Understanding, New Hope|publisher=WHO |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO further states that the well-being of an individual is encompassed in the realization of their abilities, coping with normal stresses of life, productive work and contribution to their community.&lt;ref name="WHO factsheet"&gt;{{cite web|date=August 2014|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs220/en/|title=Mental health: strengthening our response|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how "mental health" is defined.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;

==Mental health and mental illness==
According to the U.K. surgeon general (1999), mental health is the successful performance of mental function, resulting in productive activities, fulfilling relationships with other people, and providing the ability to adapt to change and cope with adversity. The term ''mental illness'' refers collectively to all diagnosable [[mental disorder]]s—health conditions characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior associated with distress or impaired functioning.&lt;ref&gt;National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, 2011{{Full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person struggling with their mental health may experience this because of stress, [[loneliness]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], relationship problems, death of a loved one, [[suicidal thoughts]], [[grief]], [[addiction]], [[ADHD]],     [[Cutting]], [[Self-harm]], [[Self-Injury]], [[burning]], various [[mood disorder]]s, or other mental illnesses of varying degrees, as well as [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Practicing Effective Prevention |date=11 January 2016 |website=Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies |publisher=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |url=http://captus.samhsa.gov/prevention-practice/prevention-and-behavioral-health/behavioral-health-lens-prevention/1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kitchener, BA 2002, p 5"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kitchener |first1=Betty |last2=Jorm |first2=Anthony |date=2002 |title=Mental Health First Aid Manual |edition= 1st |publisher=Center for Mental Health Research, Australian National University |location=Canberra |isbn=978-0-7315-4891-0 |oclc=62228904 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Therapist]]s, [[psychiatrist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[social work]]ers, [[nurse practitioner]]s or [[physicians]] can help manage mental illness with treatments such as therapy, counseling, or medication.

==History==
{{See also|History of mental disorders}} 
In the mid-19th century, William Sweetser was the first to coin the term "mental hygiene", which can be seen as the precursor to contemporary approaches to work on promoting positive mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Shook |editor-first=John R. |date=April 2012 |chapter=Sweetser, William |pages=1016–1020 |title=Dictionary of Early American Philosophers |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |isbn=978-1-4411-7140-5 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oOqoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mandell1995&gt;{{cite web |first=Wallace |last=Mandell |date=1995 |title=Origins of Mental Health, The Realization of an Idea |website=Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |location=Baltimore, MD |access-date=9 June 2015 |url=http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/mental-health/about-us/origins-of-mental-health.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Ray]], one of the founders and the fourth president &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isaac Ray Award|url=https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/awards-leadership-opportunities/awards/isaac-ray-award|website=www.psychiatry.org|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[American Psychiatric Association]], further defined mental hygiene as "the art of preserving the mind against all incidents and influences calculated to deteriorate its qualities, impair its energies, or derange its movements."&lt;ref name=Mandell1995/&gt;

[[Dorothea Dix]] (1802–1887) was an important figure in the development of the "mental hygiene" movement. Dix was a school teacher who endeavored throughout her life to help people with mental disorders, and to bring to light the deplorable conditions into which they were put.&lt;ref name=Barlow1&gt;Barlow, D.H., Durand, V.M., Steward, S.H. (2090). ''Abnormal psychology: An integrative approach'' (Second Canadian Edition). Toronto: Nelson. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; This was known as the "mental hygiene movement".&lt;ref name=Barlow1/&gt; Before this movement, it was not uncommon that people affected by mental illness in the 19th century would be considerably neglected, often left alone in deplorable conditions, barely even having sufficient clothing.&lt;ref name=Barlow1/&gt; Dix's efforts were so great that there was a rise in the number of patients in mental health facilities, which sadly resulted in these patients receiving less attention and care, as these institutions were largely understaffed.&lt;ref name=Barlow1/&gt;

[[Emil Kraepelin]] in 1896 developed the [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of mental disorders which has dominated the field for nearly 80 years. Later the proposed disease model of abnormality was subjected to analysis and considered normality to be relative to the physical, geographical and cultural aspects of the defining group.

At the beginning of the 20th century, [[Clifford Whittingham Beers|Clifford Beers]] founded "Mental Health America – National Committee for Mental Hygiene", after publication of his accounts from lived experience in [[lunatic asylums]], ''A Mind That Found Itself'', in 1908&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Peck (2013),''Mental Health America – Origins'', Retrieved June 9, 2015, from [http://www.socialwelfarehistory.com/organizations/mental-health-america-origins The Social Welfare History Project].&lt;/ref&gt; and opened the first outpatient mental health [[clinic]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=CliffordBeersClinic&gt;Clifford Beers Clinic. (2006, October 30). ''About Clifford Beers Clinic''. Retrieved June 1, 2007, from [http://www.cliffordbeers.org/aboutus.htm CliffordBeers.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409125103/http://www.cliffordbeers.org/aboutus.htm |date=2007-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mental hygiene movement, related to the [[social hygiene movement]], had at times been associated with advocating [[eugenics]] and [[sterilisation (medicine)|sterilisation]] of those considered too mentally deficient to be assisted into productive work and contented family life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C9IOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%27moral+hygiene%27+%27social+hygiene%27+%27mental+hygiene%27+movement&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Social Hygiene in 20th Century Britain] Taylor &amp; Francis, Page 80 to 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/childhood/Gr-Im/Hygiene.html Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society: Hygiene] Jacqueline S. Wilkie.&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-WWII years, references to mental hygiene were gradually replaced by the term 'mental health' due to its positive aspect that evolves from the treatment of illness to preventive and promotive areas of healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bertolote |first1=José |date=June 2008 |title=The roots of the concept of mental health |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=113–116 |pmc=2408392 |pmid=18560478 |doi=10.1002/j.2051-5545.2008.tb00172.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie Jahoda]] described six major, fundamental categories that can be used to categorize mentally healthy individuals: a positive attitude towards the self, personal growth, integration, autonomy, a true perception of reality, and environmental mastery, which include adaptability and healthy interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jahoda|first1=Marie|title=Current concepts of positive mental health|date=1958|doi=10.1037/11258-000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Mental illnesses are more common than [[cancer]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], or [[heart disease]]. Over 26 percent of all Americans over the age of 18 meet the criteria for having a mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Mental Health, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A WHO report estimates the global cost of mental illness at nearly $2.5 trillion (two-thirds in indirect costs) in 2010, with a projected increase to over $6 trillion by 2030.

Evidence from the [[World Health Organization]] suggests that nearly half of the world's population are affected by mental illness with an impact on their self-esteem, relationships and ability to function in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Storrie|first=K|author2=Ahern, K. |author3=Tuckett, A. |title=A systematic review: Students with mental health problems—a growing problem|journal=International Journal of Nursing Practice |year=2010|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1111/j.1440-172x.2009.01813.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An individual's emotional health can also impact physical health and poor mental health can lead to problems such as [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name="Richards 2010 247"&gt;

Maintaining good mental health is crucial to living a long and healthy life. Good mental health can enhance one's life, while poor mental health can prevent someone from living an enriching life. According to Richards, Campania, &amp; Muse-Burke, "There is growing evidence that is showing emotional abilities are associated with prosocial behaviors such as stress management and physical health."&lt;ref name="Richards 2010 247"/&gt; Their research also concluded that people who lack emotional expression are inclined to anti-social behaviors (e.g., [[drug]] and [[alcohol abuse]], physical fights, [[vandalism]]), which are a direct reflection of their mental health and suppress emotions.&lt;ref name="Richards 2010 247"/&gt; Adults and children with mental illness may experience [[social stigma]], which can exacerbate the issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heary|first=Caroline|last2=Hennessy|first2=Eilis|last3=Swords|first3=Lorraine|last4=Corrigan|first4=Patrick|date=2017-11-01|title=Stigma towards Mental Health Problems during Childhood and Adolescence: Theory, Research and Intervention Approaches|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10826-017-0829-y|journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies|language=en|volume=26|issue=11|pages=2949–2959|doi=10.1007/s10826-017-0829-y|issn=1062-1024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Well-being|Mental wellness]] is generally viewed as a positive attribute, even if the person does not have any diagnosed mental health condition. This definition of mental health highlights [[emotion]]al well-being, the capacity to live a full and [[creativity|creative]] life, and the flexibility to deal with life's inevitable challenges. Some discussions are formulated in terms of contentment or happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Michael C. |title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment |date=2014 |publisher=Outskirts Press |isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5 |pages=6–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many therapeutic systems and self-help books offer methods and philosophies espousing strategies and techniques vaunted as effective for further improving the mental wellness.

=== Children and young adults ===
{{see also|Depression in childhood and adolescence}}
Mental health and stability is a very important factor in a person’s everyday life. [[Social skills]], behavioral skills, and someone’s way of thinking are just some of the things that the human brain develops at an early age. Learning how to interact with others and how to focus on certain subjects are essential lessons to learn from the time we can talk all the way to when we are so old that we can barely walk. However, there are some people out there who have difficulty with these kind of skills and behaving like an average person. This is a most likely the cause of having a mental illness. A mental illness is a wide range of conditions that affect a person’s mood, thinking, and behavior. About 26% of people in the United States, ages 18 and older, have been diagnosed with some kind of mental disorder. However, not much is said about children with mental illnesses even though there are many that will develop one, even as early as age three.

The most common mental illnesses in children include, but are not limited to, [[ADHD]], [[autism]] and [[anxiety disorder]], as well as [[Depression in childhood and adolescence|depression]] in older children and teens. Having a mental illness at a younger age is much different from having one in your thirties. Children's brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five.&lt;ref name="Lee, Francis S. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lee|first1=Francis S. |last2=Heimer|first2=Hakon |last3=Giedd|first3=Jay N. |last4=Lein|first4=Edward S. |last5=Šestan|first5=Nenad |last6=Weinberger|first6=Daniel R. |last7=Casey|first7=B.J. |title=Adolescent Mental Health—Opportunity and Obligation |journal=Science |volume=346 |issue=6209 |pages=547–549 |date=31 October 2014 |pmid=25359951 |doi=10.1126/science.1260497 |pmc=5069680}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a mental illness is thrown into the mix, it becomes significantly harder for a child to acquire the necessary skills and habits that people use throughout the day. For example, behavioral skills don’t develop as fast as motor or sensory skills do.&lt;ref name="Lee, Francis S. 2014"/&gt; So when a child has an anxiety disorder, they begin to lack proper social interaction and associate many ordinary things with intense fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Staikova|first1=Ekaterina |last2=Gomes|first2=Hilary |last3=Tartter|first3=Vivien |last4=McCabe|first4=Allyssa |last5=Halperin|first5=Jeffrey M. |date=December 2013 |title=Pragmatic Deficits and Social Impairment in Children with ADHD |journal=[[Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry]] |volume=54 |issue=12 |pages=1275–283 |pmid=23682627 |pmc=3648855 |doi=10.1111/jcpp.12082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be scary for the child because they don’t necessarily understand why they act and think the way that they do. Many researchers say that parents should keep an eye on their child if they have any reason to believe that something is slightly off.&lt;ref name="Lee, Francis S. 2014"/&gt; If the children are evaluated earlier, they become more acquainted to their disorder and treating it becomes part of their daily routine.&lt;ref name="Lee, Francis S. 2014"/&gt; This is opposed to adults who might not recover as quickly because it is more difficult for them to adapt.

Mental illness affects not only the person themselves, but the people around them. Friends and family also play an important role in the child’s mental health stability and treatment. If the child is young, parents are the ones who evaluate their child and decide whether or not they need some form of help.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hinshaw |first1=Stephen P. |date=July 2005 |title=The Stigmatization of Mental Illness in Children and Parents: Developmental Issues, Family Concerns, and Research Needs. |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=7 |pages=714–34 |pmid=15972067 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01456.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends are a support system for the child and family as a whole. Living with a mental disorder is never easy, so it’s always important to have people around to make the days a little easier. However, there are negative factors that come with the social aspect of mental illness as well. Parents are sometimes held responsible for their child’s own illness.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005"/&gt; People also say that the parents raised their children in a certain way or they acquired their behavior from them. Family and friends are sometimes so ashamed of the idea of being close to someone with a disorder that the child feels isolated and thinks that they have to hide their illness from others.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005"/&gt; When in reality, hiding it from people prevents the child from getting the right amount of social interaction and treatment in order to thrive in today’s society.

[[Social stigma|Stigma]] is also a well-known factor in mental illness. Stigma is defined as “a mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance, quality, or person.” Stigma is used especially when it comes to the mentally disabled. People have this assumption that everyone with a mental problem, no matter how mild or severe, is automatically considered destructive or a criminal person. Thanks to the media, this idea has been planted in our brains from a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wahl|first1=Otto F. |title=Depictions of Mental Illnesses in Children's Media |journal=[[Journal of Mental Health]] |volume=12 |issue=3 |date=June 2003 |pages=249–58 |doi=10.1080/0963823031000118230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Watching movies about teens with depression or children with Autism makes us think that all of the people that have a mental illness are like the ones on TV. In reality, the media displays an exaggerated version of most illnesses. Unfortunately, not many people know that, so they continue to belittle those with disorders. In a recent study, a majority of young people associate mental illness with extreme sadness or violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fox|first1=C. |last2=Buchanan‐Barrow|first2=E. |last3=Barrett|first3=M. |date=January 2008 |title=Children's Understanding of Mental Illness: An Exploratory Study |journal=Child: Care, Health and Development |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=10–18 |pmid=18171438 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2214.2007.00783.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Now that children are becoming more and more open to technology and the media itself, future generations will then continue to pair mental illness with negative thoughts. The media should be explaining that many people with disorders like [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and [[anxiety]], with the right treatment, can live ordinary lives and should not be punished for something they cannot help.

''Sueki'', (2013) carried out a study titled “''The effect of suicide–related internet use on users’ mental health: A longitudinal Study”''. This study investigated the effects of suicide-related internet use on user’s suicidal thoughts, predisposition to depression and anxiety and loneliness. The study consisted of 850 internet users; the data was obtained by carrying out a questionnaire amongst the participants. This study found that browsing websites related to suicide, and methods used to commit suicide, had a negative effect on suicidal thoughts and increased depression and anxiety tendencies. The study concluded that as suicide-related internet use adversely affected the mental health of certain age groups it may be prudent to reduce or control their exposure to these websites. These findings certainly suggest that the internet can indeed have a profoundly negative impact on our mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sueki|title=The Effect of Suicide-Related Internet Use on Users’ Mental Health.|date=2013|pages= 348–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] compared that 50 years ago children were either categorized as good or bad, and today "all children are good, but some are mentally healthy and others are mentally ill". The social control and forced identity creation is the cause of many mental health problems among today's children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.szasz.com/latimes3152001.html "With Friends Like These, Pity America's Kids" Author Szasz. The Los Angeles Times, Op-Ed, March 15, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; A behaviour or misbehaviour might not be an illness but exercise of their [[free will]] and today's immediacy in drug administration for every problem along with the [[law|legal]] over-guarding and regard of a [[Minor (law)|child]]'s status as a [[Child#Age of responsibility|dependent]] shakes their personal self and invades their internal growth.

===Prevention===
{{See also | Mental disorder#Prevention }}
Mental health is conventionally defined as a hybrid of absence of a [[Mental disorders|mental disorder]] and presence of well-being. Focus is increasing on [[Mental disorders#Prevention|preventing mental disorders]].
Prevention is beginning to appear in mental health strategies, including the 2004 WHO report "''Prevention of Mental Disorders''", the 2008 EU "Pact for Mental Health" and the 2011 US National Prevention Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=National Research Council |author2=Institute of Medicine |editor1-last=England|editor1-first=Mary Jane |editor2-last=Sim|editor2-first=Leslie J. |date=2009 |title=Depression in parents, parenting, and children: Opportunities to improve identification, treatment, and prevention |location=Washington, DC |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=978-0-309-12178-1 |doi=10.17226/12565 |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12565/depression-in-parents-parenting-and-children-opportunities-to-improve-identification }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=January 2016}} Some commentators have argued that a pragmatic and practical approach to mental disorder prevention at work would be to treat it the same way as physical injury prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.humanengineers.com/hr_library/staffs-mental-health-workplace-safety-issue/|title=Your Staff's Mental Health Is a Workplace Safety Issue - Humanengineers|date=2017-06-20|work=Humanengineers|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prevention of a disorder at a young age may significantly decrease the chances that a child will suffer from a disorder later in life, and shall be the most efficient and effective measure from a public health perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jeronimus BF, Kotov R, Riese H, Ormel J | year = 2016| title = Neuroticism's prospective association with mental disorders: a meta-analysis on 59 longitudinal/prospective studies with 443 313 participants | url = | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 46 | issue = 14| pages = 2883–2906 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291716001653 | pmid=27523506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prevention may require the regular consultation of a [[physician]] for at least twice a year to detect any signs that reveal any mental health concerns.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Cultural and religious considerations===
Mental health is a socially constructed and socially defined concept; that is, different societies, groups, [[culture]]s, institutions and professions have very different ways of conceptualizing its nature and causes, determining what is mentally healthy, and deciding what interventions, if any, are appropriate.&lt;ref name=Weare2000_p12&gt;{{cite book |last=Weare |first=Katherine |title=Promoting Mental, Emotional and Social Health: A Whole School Approach |publisher=RoutledgeFalmer |year=2000 |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-16875-5 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, different professionals will have different cultural, class, political and religious backgrounds, which will impact the [[methodology]] applied during treatment.

Research has shown that there is [[Social stigma|stigma]] attached to mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Deputy Prime Minister – Social Exclusion Unit: "[https://web.archive.org/web/20081229152129/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/factsheet_stigma.pdf Factsheet 1: Stigma and Discrimination on Mental Health Grounds]". 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] organized the campaign ''Changing Minds'' (1998–2003) to help reduce stigma.&lt;ref&gt;Royal College of Psychiatrists: [http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/campaigns/previouscampaigns/changingminds.aspx Changing Minds].&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this stigma, responses to a positive diagnosis may be a display of [[denialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=Phil|title=Mental Health Ethics: The Human Context |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136881930 |date=2010 |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing and eliminating the social stigma and [[Treatment of mental disorders|perceived stigma]] attached to mental illness has been recognized as a crucial part to addressing the education of mental health issues. In the United States, the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness|National Alliance of Mental Illness]] is an institution that was founded in 1979 to represent and advocate for victims struggling with mental health issues. NAMI also helps to educate about mental illnesses and health issues, while also working to eliminate the stigma&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.curestigma.org/|title=NAMI Presents: Cure Stigma|website=NAMI Presents: Cure Stigma|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; attached to these disorders such as anxiety and depression.

Many [[mental health professional]]s are beginning to, or already understand, the importance of competency in religious diversity and [[spirituality]]. The [[American Psychological Association]] explicitly states that [[religion]] must be respected. Education in [[spirituality|spiritual]] and religious matters is also required by the [[American Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref name=HandbookofPsychotherapyandReligousDiversity_p4&gt;{{cite book |last1=Richards |first1=PS |last2=Bergin |first2=AE |title=Handbook of Psychotherapy and Religious Diversity |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |year=2000 |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-1-55798-624-5 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotional improvement==
{{see also|Dignity of risk}}
Unemployment has been shown to have a negative impact on an individual's emotional well-being, [[self-esteem]] and more broadly their mental health. Increasing unemployment has been show to have a significant impact on mental health, predominantly depressive disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Extremera, Rey, Duan.  “Attenuating the Negative Impact of Unemployment: The Interactive Effects of Perceived Emotional Intelligence and Well-Being on Suicide Risk.” 29 Sep. 2016, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5042532/. Web. Accessed 29 Sep. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important consideration when reviewing the triggers for mental health disorders in any population survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879109000037|title = Unemployment impairs mental health: Meta-analysis|last = Paul|first = Karsten|date = 2009|journal = Journal of Vocational Behavior|doi = 10.1016/j.jvb.2009.01.001|pmid = |access-date = 2015-04-16|volume=74|pages=264–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to improve your emotional mental health, the root of the issue has to be resolved. "Prevention emphasizes the avoidance of risk factors; promotion aims to enhance an individual's ability to achieve a positive sense of [[self-esteem]], mastery, well-being, and social inclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Power|first=A|title=Transforming the Nation's Health: Next Steps in Mental Health Promotion|journal=American Journal of Public Health|year=2010|volume=100|issue=12|pages=2343–6|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2010.192138|pmid=20966366|pmc=2978180}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very important to improve your emotional mental health by surrounding yourself with positive relationships. We as humans, feed off companionships and interaction with other people. Another way to improve your emotional mental health is participating in activities that can allow you to relax and take time for yourself. [[Yoga]] is a great example of an activity that calms your entire body and nerves. According to a study on well-being by Richards, Campania and Muse-Burke, "[[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] is considered to be a purposeful state, it may be that those who practice it believe in its importance and value being mindful, so that valuing of self-care activities may influence the intentional component of mindfulness."&lt;ref name="Richards 2010 247"/&gt;

===Care navigation===
{{main|Mental health care navigator}} 
Mental health care navigation helps to guide patients and families through the fragmented, often confusing mental health industries. Care navigators work closely with patients and families through discussion and collaboration to provide information on best therapies as well as referrals to practitioners and facilities specializing in particular forms of emotional improvement. The difference between therapy and care navigation is that the care navigation process provides information and directs patients to therapy rather than providing therapy. Still, care navigators may offer diagnosis and treatment planning. Though many care navigators are also trained therapists and doctors. Care navigation is the link between the patient and the below therapies. A clear recognition that mental health requires medical intervention was demonstrated in a study by Kessler et al. of the prevalence and treatment of mental disorders from 1990 to 2003 in the United States. Despite the prevalence of mental health disorders remaining unchanged during this period, the number of patients seeking treatment for mental disorders increased threefold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kessler|first1=Ronald C. |last2=Demler|first2=Olga |last3=Frank|first3=Richard G. |last4=Olfson|first4=Mark |last5=Pincus|first5=Harold Alan |last6=Walters|first6=Ellen E. |last7=Wang|first7=Philip |last8=Wells|first8=Kenneth B. |last9=Zaslavsky|first9=Alan M. |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa043266 |title=Prevalence and Treatment of Mental Disorders, 1990 to 2003 |date=16 June 2005 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=352 |pages=2515–2523 |doi= 10.1056/nejmsa043266|pmid=15958807 |pmc=2847367 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotional issues==

Emotional mental disorders are a leading cause of disabilities worldwide. Investigating the degree and severity of untreated emotional mental disorders throughout the world is a top priority of the [[World Mental Health survey initiative|World Mental Health]] (WMH) survey initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The World Mental Health Survey Initiative |url=http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmh/ |publisher=Harvard Medical School |access-date=23 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was created in 1998 by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thornicroft|first=G|journal=The Lancet|year=2007|volume=370|issue=9590|pages=841–850|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61414-7|title=Use of mental health services for anxiety, mood, and substance disorders in 17 countries in the WHO world mental health surveys|pmid=17826169|pmc=2847360}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Neuropsychiatric]] disorders are the leading causes of disability worldwide, accounting for 37% of all healthy life years lost through disease.These disorders are most destructive to low and middle-income countries due to their inability to provide their citizens with proper aid. Despite modern treatment and rehabilitation for emotional mental health disorders, "even economically advantaged societies have competing priorities and budgetary constraints".

The World Mental Health survey initiative has suggested a plan for countries to redesign their mental health care systems to best allocate resources. 
"A first step is documentation of services being used and the extent and nature of unmet needs for treatment. A second step could be to do a cross-national comparison of service use and unmet needs in countries with different mental health care systems. Such comparisons can help to uncover optimum financing, national policies, and delivery systems for mental health care."

Knowledge of how to provide effective emotional mental health care has become imperative worldwide. Unfortunately, most countries have insufficient data to guide decisions, absent or competing visions for resources, and near constant pressures to cut insurance and entitlements. WMH surveys were done in Africa ([[Nigeria]], South Africa), the Americas (Colombia, Mexico, United States), Asia and the Pacific ([[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine), and the middle east (Israel, Lebanon). Countries were classified with [[World Bank]] criteria as [[Low income|low-income]] ([[Nigeria]]), lower middle-income ([[China]], [[Colombia]], [[South Africa]], [[Ukraine]]), higher middle-income ([[Lebanon]], [[Mexico]]), and high-income.

The coordinated surveys on emotional mental health disorders, their severity, and treatments were implemented in the aforementioned countries. These surveys assessed the frequency, types, and adequacy of mental health service use in 17 countries in which WMH surveys are complete. The WMH also examined unmet needs for treatment in strata defined by the seriousness of mental disorders. Their research showed that "the number of respondents using any 12-month mental health service was generally lower in developing than in developed countries, and the proportion receiving services tended to correspond to countries' percentages of [[gross domestic product]] spent on health care".
"High levels of unmet need worldwide are not surprising, since [[WHO]] Project [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]]' findings of much lower mental health expenditures than was suggested by the magnitude of burdens from mental illnesses. Generally, unmet needs in [[low-income]] and [[middle-income]] countries might be attributable to these nations spending reduced amounts (usually &lt;1%) of already diminished health budgets on mental health care, and they rely heavily on out-of-pocket spending by citizens who are ill equipped for it".

==Treatment==

===Older methods of treatment===

===Trepanation ===

Archaeological records have shown that [[trepanation]] was a procedure used to treat "headaches, insanities or [[epilepsy]]" in several parts of the world in the Stone age. It was a surgical process used in the [[Stone Age]]. [[Paul Broca]] studied trepanation and came up with his own theory on it. He noticed that the fractures on the skulls dug up weren't caused by wounds inflicted due to violence, but because of careful surgical procedures. "Doctors used sharpened stones to scrape the skull and drill holes into the head of the patient" to allow evil spirits which plagued the patient to escape. There were several patients that died in these procedures, but those that survived were revered and believed to possess "properties of a mystical order".[http://mentalillness.umwblogs.org/stone-age/trepanation/] [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=wisNNoceOzoC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=kidd+1946+trepanation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NcyMWx28o2&amp;sig=JLGpBlHq4kuDp0ow1B0hc5Rj_ik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibl-6_u6TXAhUH2o8KHS9sB3cQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kidd%201946%20trepanation&amp;f=false]

===Lobotomy===

[[Lobotomy]] was used in the 20th century as a common practice of alternative treatment for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. The first ever modern [[leucotomy]] meant for the purpose of treating a mental illness occurred in 1935 by a Portuguese neurologist, [[António Egas Moniz|Antonio Egas Moniz]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize]] in medicine in 1949. [https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/03/21/the-surprising-history-of-the-lobotomy/]. This belief that mental health illnesses could be treated by surgery came from Swiss neurologist, [[Gottlieb Burckhardt]]. After conducting experiments on six patients with schizophrenia, he claimed that half of his patients recovered or calmed down.
Psychiatrist [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Walter Freeman]] believed that "an overload of emotions led to mental illness and “that cutting certain nerves in the brain could eliminate excess emotion and stabilize a personality,” according to a [[National Public Radio]] article [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5014565&amp;ps=rs]."

===Exorcisms===

"[[Exorcism]] is the religious or spiritual practice of evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person, or an area, they are believed to have possessed."

Mental health illnesses such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntington’s Disease]] (HD), [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[schizophrenia]] were believed to be signs of [[Demonic possession|possession]] by the [[Devil]]. This led to several mentally ill patients being subjected to [[exorcism]]s. This practice has been around for a long time, though decreasing steadily until it reached a low in the 18th century. It seldom occurred until the 20th century when the numbers rose due to the attention the media was giving to exorcisms. Different belief systems practice exorcisms in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jumreornvong|first1=Natty|title=Exorcism and Mental Illness Across Different Cultures|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/hopes/cgi-bin/hopes_test/exorcism-and-mental-illness-across-different-cultures/|website=web.stanford.edu|publisher=HOPES|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Methods of Treatment===

=== Pharmacotherapy ===

Pharmacotherapy is therapy that uses pharmaceutical drugs. Pharmacotherapy is used in the treatment of mental illness through the use of antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and the use of elements such as lithium.

=== Physical Activity ===

=={{anchor|Psychiatric social work}}Social work in mental health==

[[Social work]] in mental health, also called psychiatric social work, is a process where an individual in a setting is helped to attain freedom from overlapping internal and external problems (social and economic situations, family and other relationships, the physical and organizational environment, psychiatric symptoms, etc.). It aims for harmony, [[quality of life]], self-actualization and personal adaptation across all systems. Psychiatric social workers are [[mental health professional]]s that can assist patients and their family members in coping with both mental health issues and various economic or social problems caused by mental illness or psychiatric dysfunctions and to attain improved mental health and well-being. They are vital members of the treatment teams in Departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences in hospitals. They are employed in both outpatient and inpatient settings of a hospital, nursing homes, state and local governments, substance abuse clinics, correctional facilities, health care services...etc.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham P. Francis, Social Work in Mental Health: Contexts and Theories for Practice&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychiatric social work there are three distinct groups. One made up of the [[social work]]ers in psychiatric organizations and hospitals. The second group consists members interested with mental hygiene education and holding designations that involve functioning in various mental health services and the third group consist of individuals involved directly with treatment and recovery process.&lt;ref name="FrenchStandards1940"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lois Angelina Meredith French|author2=American Association of Psychiatric Social Workers. Advisory Committee on Standards|title=Psychiatric social work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bo9pAAAAIAAJ|year=1940|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, social workers provide most of the mental health services. According to government sources, 60 percent of mental health professionals are clinically trained [[social worker]]s, 10 percent are [[psychiatrist]]s, 23 percent are [[psychologist]]s, and 5 percent are [[psychiatric nurse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Social Workers, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental health social workers in Japan have professional knowledge of health and welfare and skills essential for person's well-being. Their social work training enables them as a professional to carry out Consultation assistance for mental disabilities and their social reintegration; Consultation regarding the rehabilitation of the victims; Advice and guidance for post-discharge residence and re-employment after hospitalized care, for major life events in regular life, money and self-management and in other relevant matters in order to equip them to adapt in daily life. Social workers provide individual home visits for mentally ill and do welfare services available, with specialized training a range of procedural services are coordinated for home, workplace and school. In an administrative relationship, Psychiatric social workers provides consultation, leadership, conflict management and work direction. Psychiatric social workers who provides assessment and psychosocial interventions function as a clinician, counselor and municipal staff of the health centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=精神保健福祉士の受験資格を取得するための養成課程 |trans-title=Psychiatric Social Worker Training Course |website=Japan College of Social Work |url=http://www.jcsw.ac.jp/faculty/tsushin/seishin/index.html |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roles and functions===
Social workers play many roles in mental health settings, including those of [[case management (mental health)|case manager]], [[advocate]], administrator, and [[Therapy|therapist]]. The major functions of a psychiatric social worker are promotion and [[preventive healthcare|prevention]], [[Therapy|treatment]], and [[Psychiatric rehabilitation|rehabilitation]]. Social workers may also practice:

* [[Counseling]] and [[psychotherapy]]
* [[Case management (mental health)|Case management]] and support services
* [[Crisis intervention]]
* [[Psychoeducation]]
* [[Psychiatric rehabilitation]] and [[Recovery approach|recovery]]
* Care coordination and [[Monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]]
* Program management/administration
* Program, policy and resource development
* Research and evaluation

Psychiatric social workers conduct [[psychosocial]] assessments of the patients and work to enhance patient and family communications with the medical team members and ensure the inter-professional cordiality in the team to secure patients with the best possible care and to be active partners in their care planning. Depending upon the requirement, social workers are often involved in illness education, counseling and [[psychotherapy]]. In all areas, they are pivotal to the aftercare process to facilitate a careful transition back to family and community.

===History===

====United States====
During the 1840s, [[Dorothea Lynde Dix]], a retired Boston teacher who is considered the founder of the Mental Health Movement, began a crusade that would change the way people with mental disorders were viewed and treated. Dix was not a social worker; the profession was not established until after her death in 1887. However, her life and work were embraced by early psychiatric social workers, and she is considered one of the pioneers of psychiatric social work along with Elizabeth Horton, who in 1907 was the first psychiatric social worker in the New York hospital system, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, 1969; Shapiro, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The early twentieth century was a time of progressive change in attitudes towards mental illness. Community Mental Health Centers Act was passed in 1963. This policy encouraged the [[deinstitutionalisation]] of people with mental illness. Later, mental health consumer movement came by 1980s. A consumer was defined as a person who has received or is currently receiving services for a psychiatric condition. People with mental disorders and their families became advocates for better care. Building public understanding and awareness through consumer advocacy helped bring mental illness and its treatment into mainstream medicine and social services.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph &amp; Corrigan, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s focus was on Managed care movement which aimed at a health care delivery system to eliminate unnecessary and inappropriate care in order to reduce costs &amp; Recovery movement in which by principle acknowledges that many people with serious mental illness spontaneously recover and others recover and improve with proper treatment.&lt;ref&gt;SAMHSA, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Role of social workers made an impact with [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)]] social workers worked out of the [[NATO]] hospital in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] bases. They made visits to provide counseling services at forward operating bases. Twenty-two percent of the clients were diagnosed with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], 17 percent with depression, and 7 percent with [[alcohol abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;Dao, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a high level of [[suicide]]s was reached among active-duty soldiers: 160 confirmed or suspected Army suicides. In 2008, the Marine Corps had a record 52 suicides.&lt;ref&gt;Zoroya, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The stress of long and repeated deployments to war zones, the dangerous and confusing nature of both wars, wavering public support for the wars, and reduced troop morale have all contributed to the escalating mental health issues.&lt;ref&gt;Knickerbocker, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Military and civilian social workers are primary service providers in the veterans’ health care system.

Mental health services, is a loose network of services ranging from highly structured [[Inpatient care|inpatient]] psychiatric units to informal support groups, where psychiatric social workers indulges in the diverse approaches in multiple settings along with other [[paraprofessional]] workers.

====Canada====
A role for psychiatric social workers was established early in Canada’s history of service delivery in the field of population health. Native North Americans understood mental trouble as an indication of an individual who had lost their equilibrium with the sense of place and belonging in general, and with the rest of the group in particular. In native healing beliefs, health and mental health were inseparable, so similar combinations of natural and spiritual remedies were often employed to relieve both mental and physical illness. These communities and families greatly valued holistic approaches for preventative health care. Indigenous peoples in Canada have faced cultural oppression and social marginalization through the actions of European colonizers and their institutions since the earliest periods of contact. Culture contact brought with it many forms of depredation. Economic, political, and religious institutions of the European settlers all contributed to the displacement and [[oppression]] of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kirmayer |editor1-first=Laurence J. |editor2-last=Valaskakis |editor2-first=Gail Guthrie |date=2009 |title=Healing Traditions: The Mental Health of Aboriginal Peoples in Canada |publisher=UBC Press |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-0-7748-1523-9 |url=http://www.ubcpress.ca/books/pdf/chapters/2008/HealingTraditions.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}}

The first officially recorded treatment practices were in 1714, when [[Quebec]] opened wards for the mentally ill. In the 1830s social services were active through charity organizations and church parishes ([[Social Gospel]] Movement). Asylums for the insane were opened in 1835 in Saint John and New Brunswick. In 1841 in [[Toronto]], when care for the mentally ill became institutionally based. Canada became a self-governing dominion in 1867, retaining its ties to the British crown. During this period age of [[Capitalism#Industrial capitalism|industrial capitalism]] began, which lead to a social and economic dislocation in many forms. By 1887 asylums were converted to hospitals and nurses and attendants were employed for the care of the mentally ill. The first social work training began at the University of Toronto in 1914. In 1918 Clarence Hincks &amp; [[Clifford Whittingham Beers|Clifford Beers]] founded the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene, which later became the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]]. In the 1930s Dr. Clarence Hincks promoted prevention and of treating sufferers of mental illness before they were incapacitated/early detection.

[[World War II]] profoundly affected attitudes towards mental health. The medical examinations of recruits revealed that thousands of apparently healthy adults suffered mental difficulties. This knowledge changed public attitudes towards mental health, and stimulated research into preventive measures and methods of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of CMHA |website=Canadian Mental Health Association: Ontario |url=https://ontario.cmha.ca/about-us/history-of-cmha}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 Mental Health Week was introduced across Canada. For the first half of the twentieth century, with a period of [[deinstitutionalisation]] beginning in the late 1960s psychiatric social work succeeded to the current emphasis on community-based care, psychiatric social work focused beyond the medical model’s aspects on individual diagnosis to identify and address social inequities and structural issues. In the 1980s Mental Health Act was amended to give consumers the right to choose treatment alternatives. Later the focus shifted to workforce mental health issues and environment.&lt;ref&gt;Mental Health Social Work Practice in Canada, Cheryl Regehr &amp; Graham Glancy&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
The earliest citing of mental disorders in [[India]] are from Vedic Era (2000 BC – AD 600).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Gautam, S.| year = 1991 | title = Mental health in ancient india and its relevance to modern psychiatry | journal = Indian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=41| issue=5 |pages=5–18|pmc= 2962283 | pmid=21455347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charaka Samhita, an ayurvedic textbook believed to be from 400–200 BC describes various factors of mental stability. It also has instructions regarding how to set up a care delivery system.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons and Petrucelli, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; In the same era In south India Siddha was a medical system, the great sage [[Agastya]], one of the 18 siddhas contributing to a system of medicine has included the Agastiyar Kirigai Nool, a compendium of psychiatric disorders and their recommended treatments.&lt;ref&gt;McGilvray, 1998 &amp; Nichter, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; In Atharva Veda too there are descriptions and resolutions about mental health afflictions. In the Mughal period Unani system of medicine was introduced by an Indian physician Unhammad in 1222.&lt;ref&gt;Parkar, Dawani and Apte 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Then existed form of psychotherapy was known then as ilaj-i-nafsani in Unani medicine.

The 18th century was a very unstable period in Indian history, which contributed to psychological and social chaos in the Indian subcontinent. In 1745 of lunatic asylums were developed in Bombay (Mumbai) followed by Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1784, and Madras (Chennai) in 1794. The need to establish hospitals became more acute, first to treat and manage Englishmen and Indian ‘sepoys’ (military men) employed by the British East India Company.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, 2004; Thara, Padmavati &amp; Srinivasan, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The First Lunacy Act (also called Act No. 36) that came into effect in 1858 was later modified by a committee appointed in Bengal in 1888. Later, the Indian Lunacy Act, 1912 was brought under this legislation. A rehabilitation programme was initiated between 1870s and 1890s for persons with mental illness at the Mysore Lunatic Asylum, and then an occupational therapy department was established during this period in almost each of the lunatic asylums. The programme in the asylum was called ‘work therapy’. In this programme, persons with mental illness were involved in the field of agriculture for all activities. This programme is considered as the seed of origin of psychosocial rehabilitation in India.

Berkeley-Hill, superintendent of the European Hospital (now known as the [[Central Institute of Psychiatry|Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP)]], established in 1918), was deeply concerned about the improvement of mental hospitals in those days. The sustained efforts of Berkeley-Hill helped to raise the standard of treatment and care and he also persuaded the government to change the term ‘asylum’ to ‘hospital’ in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques similar to the current token-economy were first started in 1920 and called by the name ‘habit formation chart’ at the CIP, Ranchi. In 1937, the first post of psychiatric social worker was created in the child guidance clinic run by the Dhorabji Tata School of Social Work (established in 1936), It is considered as the first documented evidence of social work practice in Indian mental health field.

After Independence in 1947, general hospital psychiatry units (GHPUs) where established to improve conditions in existing hospitals, while at the same time encouraging outpatient care through these units. In Amritsar a Dr. Vidyasagar, instituted active involvement of families in the care of persons with mental illness. This was advanced practice ahead of its times regarding treatment and care. This methodology had a greater impact on social work practice in the mental health field especially in reducing the stigmatisation. In 1948 Gauri Rani Banerjee, trained in the United States, started a master’s course in medical and psychiatric social work at the Dhorabji Tata School of Social Work (Now TISS). Later the first trained psychiatric social worker was appointed in 1949 at the adult psychiatry unit of Yervada mental hospital, Pune.

In various parts of the country, in mental health service settings, social workers were employed—in 1956 at a mental hospital in Amritsar, in 1958 at a child guidance clinic of the college of nursing, and in Delhi in 1960 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and in 1962 at the [[Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital]]. In 1960, the Madras Mental Hospital (Now [[Institute of Mental Health (Chennai)|Institute of Mental Health]]), employed social workers to bridge the gap between doctors and patients. In 1961 the social work post was created at the NIMHANS. In these settings they took care of the psychosocial aspect of treatment. This had long-term greater impact of social work practice in mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ratna Varma, Psychiatric Social Work in India&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 by the recommendation Mental Health Advisory Committee, Ministry of Health, Government of India, NIMHANS commenced Department of Psychiatric Social Work started and a two-year Postgraduate Diploma in Psychiatric Social Work was introduced in 1968. In 1978, the nomenclature of the course was changed to MPhil in Psychiatric Social Work. Subsequently, a PhD Programme was introduced. By the recommendations Mudaliar committee in 1962, Diploma in Psychiatric Social Work was started in 1970 at the European Mental Hospital at Ranchi (now CIP), upgraded the program and added other higher training courses subsequently.

A new initiative to integrate mental health with general health services started in 1975 in India. The Ministry of Health, [[Government of India]] formulated the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) and launched it in 1982. The same was reviewed in 1995 and based on that, the District Mental Health Program (DMHP) launched in 1996 and sought to integrate mental health care with public health care.&lt;ref&gt;Khandelwal et al. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This model has been implemented in all the states and currently there are 125 DMHP sites in India.

[[National Human Rights Commission]] (NHRC) in 1998 and 2008 carried out systematic, intensive and critical examinations of mental hospitals in India. This resulted in recognition of the human rights of the persons with mental illness by the NHRC. From the NHRC's report as part of the NMHP, funds were provided for upgrading the facilities of mental hospitals. This is studied to result in positive changes over the past 10 years than in the preceding five decades by the 2008 report of the [[National Human Rights Commission of India|NHRC]] and [[National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences|NIMHANS]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagaraja &amp; Murthy, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Mental Health Care Bill was passed which ensures and legally [[Entitlement|entitles]] access to treatments with coverage from insurance, safeguarding dignity of the afflicted person, improving legal and healthcare access and allows for free medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 August 2016 |title=Mental Health Care Bill Gets Clearance From Rajya Sabha |newspaper=The Huffington Post India |publisher=Times Internet Limited |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/08/09/mental-health-care-bill-gets-clearance-from-rajya-sabha/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 August 2016 |title=Rajya Sabha passes ‘patient-centric’ Mental Health Care Bill 2013 |newspaper=Hindustan Times |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-passes-patient-centric-mental-health-care-bill-2013/story-p2ul6lWwLuX1wCvlCD5i3H.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://indianexpress.com/article/what-is/mental-healthcare-bill-passed-parliament-lok-sabha-4588288/&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, [[Disabilities Act]] 1995 was repealed with [[Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016|Rights of Persons with Disabilities Ac]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t (RPWD), 2016 from the 2014 Bill which ensures benefits for a wider population with disabilities. The Bill before becoming an Act was pushed for amendments by stakeholders mainly against alarming clauses in the "Equality and Non discrimination" section that diminishes the power of the act and allows establishments to overlook or discriminate against persons with disabilities and against the general lack of directives that requires to ensure the proper implementation of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.disabilityaffairs.gov.in/upload/uploadfiles/files/RPWD%20ACT%202016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livelaw.in/salient-features-rights-persons-disabilities-rpwd-bill/&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of any universally accepted single licensing authority compared to foreign countries puts social workers at general in risk. But general bodies/councils accepts automatically a university-qualified social worker as a professional licensed to practice or as a qualified clinician. Lack of a centralized council in tie-up with Schools of Social Work also makes a decline in promotion for the scope of social workers as mental health professionals. Though in this midst the service of social workers has given a facelift of the mental health sector in the country with other allied professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Sahu, K.K. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence and programs==
{{See also|Global mental health}}
Evidence suggests that 450 million people worldwide are impacted by mental health, [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] ranks fourth among the top 10 leading causes of disease worldwide. Within 20 years, mental illness is predicted to become the leading cause of disease worldwide. Women are more likely to have a mental illness than men. One million people commit suicide every year and 10 to 20 million attempt it.&lt;ref&gt;Sowers, Rowe, &amp; Clay, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
A survey conducted by [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] in 2008 regarding adults with manageable to severe neurosis reveals almost half of the population had a mental disorder at some point of their life and one in five people had a sustained disorder in the preceding 12 months. In neurotic disorders, 14% of the population experienced anxiety disorders, comorbidity disorders were the next common mental disorder with vulnerability to substance abuse and relapses. There were distinct gender differences in disposition to mental health illness. Women were found to have high rate of mental health disorders and Men had higher propensity of risk for substance abuse. The SMHWB survey showed low socioeconomic status and high dysfunctional pattern in the family was proportional to greater risk for mental health disorders. A 2010 survey regarding adults with psychosis revealed 5 persons per 1000 in the population seeks professional mental health services for [[psychotic disorders]] and the most common psychotic disorder was [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ruth Elder|author2=Katie Evans|author3=Debra Nizette|title=Psychiatric &amp; Mental Health Nursing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jpnzp7D64XcC|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-7295-8098-9|chapter=Mental Health and Illness in Australia and New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mental health services and the integration of employment support in Australia|year=2015|issn=2225-7977|doi=10.1787/9789264246591-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
According to statistics released by the Centre of Addiction and Mental Health one in five people in [[Ontario]] experience a mental health or addiction problem. Young people ages 15 to 25 are particularly vulnerable. Major depression is found to affect 8% and anxiety disorder 12% of the population. Women are 1.5 times more likely to suffer from mood and anxiety disorders. WHO points out that there are distinct gender differences in patterns of mental health and illness. The lack of power and control over their socioeconomic status, gender based violence; low social position and responsibility for the care of others render women vulnerable to mental health risks. Since more women than men seek help regarding a mental health problem, this has led to not only gender stereotyping but also reinforcing social stigma. WHO has found that this stereotyping has led doctors to diagnose depression more often in women than in men even when they display identical symptoms. Often communication between health care providers and women is authoritarian leading to either the under-treatment or over-treatment of these women.&lt;ref name="WHO factsheet"/&gt;

====Organizations====
[[Women's College Hospital]] is specifically dedicated to women's health in Canada. This hospital is located in downtown Toronto where there are several locations available for specific medical conditions. WCH is an organization that helps educate women on mental illness due to its specialization with women and mental health. The organization helps women who have symptoms of mental illnesses such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[menstruation]], [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], and [[menopause]]. They also focus on psychological issues, abuse, neglect and mental health issues from various medications.&lt;ref name="womenscollegehospital.ca"&gt;{{cite web |title=Programs &amp; Clinics |website=Women’s College Hospital |url=http://www.womenscollegehospital.ca/programs-and-services }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The countless aspect about this organization is that WCH is open to women of all ages, including pregnant women that experience poor mental health. WCH not only provides care for good mental health, but they also have a program called the "Women's Mental Health Program" where doctors and nurses help treat and educate women regarding mental health collaboratively, individually, and online by answering questions from the public.&lt;ref name="womenscollegehospital.ca"/&gt;

The second organization is the [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] (CAMH). CAMH is one of Canada's largest and most well-known health and addiction facilities, and it has received international recognitions from the [[Pan American Health Organization]] and [[WHO Collaborating Centres|World Health Organization Collaborating Centre]]. They practice in doing research in areas of addiction and mental health in both men and women. In order to help both men and women, CAMH provides "clinical care, research, education, policy development and health promotion to help transform the lives of people affected by mental health and addiction issues."&lt;ref name=WhoWeAreCAMH&gt;{{cite web |title=Who We Are |website=Centre for Addiction and Mental Health |url=http://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/about_camh/who_we_are/Pages/who_we_are.aspx |access-date=7 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CAMH is different from Women's College Hospital due to its widely known rehab centre for women who have minor addiction issues, to severe ones. This organization provides care for mental health issues by assessments, interventions, residential programs, treatments, and doctor and family support.&lt;ref name=WhoWeAreCAMH/&gt;

There are many factors that influence mental health including:

*[[Mental illness]], [[disability]], and [[suicide]] are ultimately the result of a combination of biology, environment, and access to and utilization of mental health treatment.
*Public health policies can influence access and utilization, which subsequently may improve mental health and help to progress the negative consequences of depression and its associated disability.

Emotional mental illnesses should be a particular concern in the United States since the U.S. has the highest annual prevalence rates (26 percent) for mental illnesses among a comparison of 14 developing and developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Demyttenaere|first=K|title=WHO World Mental Health Survey Consortium.

===={{anchor|Mental health policies in the United States}}Policies====
The mental health policies in the United States have experienced four major reforms: the American asylum movement led by [[Dorothea Dix]] in 1843; the "mental hygiene" movement inspired by [[Clifford Whittingham Beers|Clifford Beers]] in 1908; the [[deinstitutionalization]] started by Action for Mental Health in 1961; and the community support movement called for by The CMCH Act Amendments of 1975.&lt;ref name="U.S. Public Health Service"&gt;{{cite book |author=U.S. Public Health Service |date=1999 |title=Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General |chapter=Overview of Mental Health Services |access-date=19 February 2012 |chapter-url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/chapter2/sec7.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211145002/http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/chapter2/sec7.html |archive-date=11 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, [[Dorothea Dix]] submitted a Memorial to the Legislature of Massachusetts, describing the abusive treatment and horrible conditions received by the mentally ill patients in jails, cages, and almshouses. She revealed in her Memorial: "I proceed, gentlemen, briefly to call your attention to the present state of insane persons confined within this Commonwealth, in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dix |first=D | date=April 2006 | title=‘I Tell What I Have Seen’—The Reports of Asylum Reformer Dorothea Dix. 1843 |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=622–624 |doi=10.2105/ajph.96.4.622 |pmid=16551962 |pmc=1470564 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many asylums were built in that period, with high fences or walls separating the patients from other community members and strict rules regarding the entrance and exit. In those asylums, traditional treatments were well implemented: drugs were not used as a cure for a disease, but a way to reset equilibrium in a person's body, along with other essential elements such as healthy diets, fresh air, middle class culture, and the visits by their neighboring residents.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In 1866, a recommendation came to the New York State Legislature to establish a separate asylum for chronic mentally ill patients. Some hospitals placed the chronic patients into separate wings or wards, or different buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luchins |first=AS |date=November 1989 |title=Moral Treatment in Asylums and General Hospitals in 19th-Century America |journal=The Journal of Psychology |volume=123 |issue=6 |pages=585–607 |pmid=2691669 |doi=10.1080/00223980.1989.10543013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Mind That Found Itself'' (1908) [[Clifford Whittingham Beers]] described the humiliating treatment he received and the deplorable conditions in the mental hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beers |first=Clifford Whittingham |author-link=Clifford Whittingham Beers |date=8 April 2004 |orig-year=1908 |title=A Mind That Found Itself: An Autobiography |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11962/11962-h/11962-h.htm |publisher=Project Gutenberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene (NCMH) was founded by a small group of reform-minded scholars and scientists – including Beer himself – which marked the beginning of the "mental hygiene" movement. The movement emphasized the importance of childhood prevention. [[World War I]] catalyzed this idea with an additional emphasis on the impact of maladjustment, which convinced the hygienists that prevention was the only practical approach to handle mental health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Sol |date=1983 |title=The Mental Hygiene Movement, the Development of Personality and the School: The Medicalization of American Education |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=123–149 |jstor=368156 |doi=10.2307/368156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, prevention was not successful, especially for chronic illness; the condemnable conditions in the hospitals were even more prevalent, especially under the pressure of the increasing number of chronically ill and the influence of the depression.&lt;ref name="U.S. Public Health Service"/&gt;

In 1961, the Joint Commission on Mental Health published a report called Action for Mental Health, whose goal was for community clinic care to take on the burden of prevention and early intervention of the mental illness, therefore to leave space in the hospitals for severe and chronic patients. The court started to rule in favor of the patients' will on whether they should be forced to treatment. By 1977, 650 community mental health centers were built to cover 43 percent of the population and serve 1.9 million individuals a year, and the lengths of treatment decreased from 6 months to only 23 days.&lt;ref name="Koyanagi, C. 1991 p.899-905"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koyanagi |first1=C |last2=Goldman |first2=H |date=September 1991 |title=The quiet success of the national plan for the chronically mentally ill |journal=Hospital &amp; Community Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=899–905 |pmid=1743659 |doi=10.1176/ps.42.9.899}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, issues still existed. Due to inflation, especially in the 1970s, the community nursing homes received less money to support the care and treatment provided. Fewer than half of the planned centers were created, and new methods did not fully replace the old approaches to carry out its full capacity of treating power.&lt;ref name="Koyanagi, C. 1991 p.899-905"/&gt; Besides, the community helping system was not fully established to support the patients' housing, vocational opportunities, income supports, and other benefits.&lt;ref name="U.S. Public Health Service"/&gt; Many patients returned to [[welfare]] and criminal justice institutions, and more became [[homeless]]. The movement of deinstitutionalization was facing great challenges.&lt;ref name=Torrey_Book&gt;{{cite web |last1=Torrey|first1=E. Fuller|authorlink1=E.

After realizing that simply changing the location of mental health care from the state hospitals to nursing houses was insufficient to implement the idea of [[deinstitutionalization]], the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] in 1975 created the Community Support Program (CSP) to provide funds for communities to set up a comprehensive mental health service and supports to help the mentally ill patients integrate successfully in the society. The program stressed the importance of other supports in addition to medical care, including housing, living expenses, employment, transportation, and education; and set up new national priority for people with serious mental disorders. In addition, the Congress enacted the [[Mental Health Systems Act of 1980]] to prioritize the service to the mentally ill and emphasize the expansion of services beyond just clinical care alone.&lt;ref name="Koyanagi, C. 2007"&gt;{{citation |last1=Koyanagi |first1=Chris |date=August 2007 |title=Learning From History: Deinstitutionalization of People with Mental Illness As Precursor to Long-Term Care Reform |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] |location=Menlo Park, CA |pages=1–22 |url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7684.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 1980s, under the influence from the Congress and the Supreme Court, many programs started to help the patients regain their benefits. A new Medicaid service was also established to serve people who were diagnosed with a "chronic mental illness." People who were temporally hospitalized were also provided aid and care and a pre-release program was created to enable people to apply for reinstatement prior to discharge.&lt;ref name="Koyanagi, C. 1991 p.899-905"/&gt; Not until 1990, around 35 years after the start of the deinstitutionalization, did the first state hospital begin to close. The number of hospitals dropped from around 300 by over 40 in the 1990s, and finally a Report on Mental Health showed the efficacy of mental health treatment, giving a range of treatments available for patients to choose.&lt;ref name="Koyanagi, C. 2007"/&gt;

However, several critics maintain that deinstitutionalization has, from a mental health point of view, been a thoroughgoing failure. The seriously mentally ill are either homeless, or in prison; in either case (especially the latter), they are getting little or no mental health care. This failure is attributed to a number of reasons over which there is some degree of contention, although there is general agreement that community support programs have been ineffective at best, due to a lack of funding.&lt;ref name=Torrey_Book/&gt;

The 2011 National Prevention Strategy included mental and emotional well-being, with recommendations including better parenting and early intervention programs, which increase the likelihood of prevention programs being included in future US mental health policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=National Prevention Council |date=16 June 2011 |title=National Prevention Strategy |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General |location=Washington, DC |format=PDF |url=http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004043040/http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=January 2016}} The [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] is researching only suicide and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention, but the National Prevention Strategy could lead to it focusing more broadly on longitudinal prevention studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prevention of Mental Disorders|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml|website=National Institute of Mental Health|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|accessdate=7 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705041918/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml |archive-date=5 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification |reason=Source contains a list of publications.

[[File:Obedience (1965).webm|thumb|thumbtime=13|''Obedience'' (1965), Stanley Milgram's documentary film on the experiment.]]
[[File:Milgram experiment v2.svg|right|thumb|200px|The experimenter (E) orders the teacher (T), the subject of the experiment, to give what the latter believes are painful electric shocks to a learner (L), who is actually an actor and [[wikt:confederate|confederate]]. The subject is led to believe that for each wrong answer, the learner was receiving actual electric shocks, though in reality there were no such punishments. Being separated from the subject, the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electro-shock generator, which played pre-recorded sounds for each shock level.&lt;ref name="ObedStudy" /&gt;]]

The '''Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures''' was a series of [[social psychology]] [[experimental psychology|experiments]] conducted by [[Yale University]] psychologist [[Stanley Milgram]]. They measured the willingness of study participants, men from a diverse range of occupations with varying levels of education, to [[Obedience (human behavior)|obey]] an [[authority|authority figure]] who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal [[conscience]]. Participants were led to believe that they were assisting an unrelated experiment, in which they had to administer electric shocks to a "learner." These fake electric shocks gradually increased to levels that would have been fatal had they been real.&lt;ref name="blass"/&gt;

The experiment found, unexpectedly, that a very high proportion of men would fully obey the instructions, albeit reluctantly. Milgram first described his [[research]] in a 1963 article in the ''[[Journal of Abnormal Psychology|Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]]''&lt;ref name="ObedStudy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milgram |first=Stanley |year=1963 |title=Behavioral Study of Obedience |journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=371–8 |pmid=14049516 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/67/4/371 |doi=10.1037/h0040525 }} [http://library.nhsggc.org.uk/mediaAssets/Mental%20Health%20Partnership/Peper%202%2027th%20Nov%20Milgram_Study%20KT.pdf as PDF.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404094832/http://academic.evergreen.edu/curricular/social_dilemmas/fall/Readings/Week_06/milgram.pdf |date=April 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later discussed his findings in greater depth in his 1974 book, ''[[Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Milgram |first=Stanley |title=Obedience to Authority; An Experimental View |publisher=Harpercollins |year=1974 |isbn=0-06-131983-X |ref=harv |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MlpEAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
[[File:Milgram Experiment advertising.png|right|250px|thumb|Milgram Experiment advertisement]]

Three individuals took part in each session of the experiment:
*The "experimenter", who was in charge of the session.
*The "teacher", a volunteer for a single session. The "teacher" was led to believe that they were merely assisting, whereas they were actually the subject of the experiment.
*The "learner", an actor and a [[wikt:confederate|confederate]] of the experimenter, who pretended to be a volunteer.
The subject and the actor arrived at the session together. The experimenter told them that they were taking part in "a scientific study of memory and learning", to see what the effect of punishment is on a subject's ability to memorize content. Also, he always clarified that the payment for their participation in the experiment was secured regardless of its development. The subject and actor drew slips of paper to determine their roles. Unknown to the subject, both slips said "teacher". The actor would always claim to have drawn the slip that read "learner", thus guaranteeing that the subject would always be the "teacher".

Next, the teacher and learner were taken into an adjacent room where the learner was strapped into what appeared to be an electric chair. The experimenter told the participants this was to ensure that the learner would not escape.&lt;ref name="ObedStudy" /&gt; In a later variation of the experiment, the confederate was sure to mention to the participant that he had a [[Cardiovascular disease|heart condition]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} At some point prior to the actual test, the teacher was given a sample [[electric shock]] from the electroshock generator in order to experience firsthand what the shock that the learner would supposedly receive during the experiment would feel like.

The teacher and learner were then separated such that they could communicate, but not see each other. The teacher was then given a list of word pairs that he was to teach the learner. The teacher began by reading the list of word pairs to the learner. The teacher would then read the first word of each pair and read four possible answers. The learner would press a button to indicate his response. If the answer was incorrect, the teacher would administer a shock to the learner, with the voltage increasing in 15-[[volt]] increments for each wrong answer. If correct, the teacher would read the next word pair.&lt;ref name=ObedStudy/&gt;

The subjects believed that for each wrong answer, the learner was receiving actual shocks. In reality, there were no shocks. After the learner was separated from the teacher, the learner set up a tape recorder integrated with the electroshock generator, which played prerecorded sounds for each shock level. As the voltage of the fake shocks increased, the learner began making audible protests, such as banging repeatedly on the wall that separated him from the teacher. When the highest voltages were reached, the learner fell silent.&lt;ref name=ObedStudy/&gt;

If at any time the teacher indicated a desire to halt the experiment, the experimenter was instructed to give specific verbal prods. The prods were, in this order:&lt;ref name=ObedStudy/&gt;
# Please ''continue''.
# The experiment requires that you ''continue''.
# It is absolutely essential that you ''continue''.
# You have no other choice, you ''must'' go on.

If the subject still wished to stop after all four successive verbal prods, the experiment was halted. Otherwise, it was halted after the subject had given the maximum 450-volt shock three times in succession.&lt;ref name=ObedStudy/&gt;

The experimenter also had prods to use if the teacher made specific comments. If the teacher asked whether the learner might suffer permanent physical harm, the experimenter replied, "Although the shocks may be painful, there is no permanent tissue damage, so please go on." If the teacher said that the learner clearly wants to stop, the experimenter replied, "Whether the learner likes it or not, you must go on until he has learned all the word pairs correctly, so please go on."&lt;ref name="ObedStudy" /&gt;

==Results==
Before conducting the experiment, Milgram polled fourteen Yale University senior-year psychology majors to predict the behavior of 100 hypothetical teachers. All of the poll respondents believed that only a very small fraction of teachers (the range was from zero to 3 out of 100, with an average of 1.2) would be prepared to inflict the maximum voltage. Milgram also informally polled his colleagues and found that they, too, believed very few subjects would progress beyond a very strong shock.&lt;ref name="ObedStudy" /&gt; He also reached out to honorary Harvard University graduate Chaim Homnick, who noted that this experiment would not be concrete evidence of the Nazis' innocence, due to fact that "poor people are more likely to cooperate." Milgram also polled forty psychiatrists from a medical school, and they believed that by the tenth shock, when the victim demands to be free, most subjects would stop the experiment. They predicted that by the 300-volt shock, when the victim refuses to answer, only 3.73 percent of the subjects would still continue and, they believed that "only a little over one-tenth of one percent of the subjects would administer the highest shock on the board."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milgram |first=Stanley |title=Some Conditions of Obedience and Disobedience to Authority |journal=Human Relations |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=57–76 |year=1965 |doi=10.1177/001872676501800105 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Milgram's first set of experiments, 65 percent (26 of 40) of experiment participants administered the experiment's final massive 450-volt shock,&lt;ref name="ObedStudy" /&gt; and all administered shocks of at least 300 volts. Subjects were uncomfortable doing so, and displayed varying degrees of tension and stress. These signs included sweating, trembling, stuttering, biting their lips, groaning, digging their fingernails into their skin, and some were even having nervous laughing fits or seizures.&lt;ref name="ObedStudy" /&gt; Every participant paused the experiment at least once to question it. Most continued after being assured by the experimenter. Some said they would refund the money they were paid for participating.

Milgram summarized the experiment in his 1974 article, "The Perils of Obedience", writing:

{{Quote|The legal and philosophic aspects of [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] are of enormous importance, but they say very little about how most people behave in concrete situations. I set up a simple experiment at Yale University to test how much [[pain]] an ordinary citizen would inflict on another person simply because he was ordered to by an experimental scientist. Stark authority was pitted against the subjects' [participants'] strongest moral imperatives against hurting others, and, with the subjects' [participants'] ears ringing with the screams of the victims, authority won more often than not. The extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority constitutes the chief finding of the study and the fact most urgently demanding explanation.

Ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process. Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work become patently clear, and they are asked to carry out actions incompatible with fundamental standards of morality, relatively few people have the resources needed to resist authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Milgram, Stanley |title=The Perils of Obedience |journal=Harper's Magazine |year=1974 |url=http://home.swbell.net/revscat/perilsOfObedience.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216075927/http://home.swbell.net/revscat/perilsOfObedience.html |archivedate=December 16, 2010 }} Abridged and adapted from ''Obedience to Authority''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The original Simulated Shock Generator and Event Recorder, or ''shock box'', is located in the [[Archives of the History of American Psychology]].

Later, Milgram and other psychologists performed variations of the experiment throughout the world, with similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milgram|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milgram later investigated the effect of the experiment's locale on obedience levels by holding an experiment in an unregistered, backstreet office in a bustling city, as opposed to at Yale, a respectable university. The level of obedience, "although somewhat reduced, was not significantly lower." What made more of a difference was the proximity of the "learner" and the experimenter. There were also variations tested involving groups.

[[Thomas Blass]] of the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] performed a [[meta-analysis]] on the results of repeated performances of the experiment. He found that while the percentage of participants who are prepared to inflict fatal voltages ranged from 28% to 91%, there was no significant trend over time and the average percentage for US studies (61%) was close to the one for non-US studies (66%).&lt;ref name="blass"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blass |first=Thomas |title=The Milgram paradigm after 35 years: Some things we now know about obedience to authority |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=955–978 |year=1999 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1999.tb00134.x|ref=harv}} [http://neuron4.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc591Readings/Blass1999.pdf as PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331122626/http://neuron4.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc591Readings/Blass1999.pdf |date=March 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blass02"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blass, Thomas |title=The Man Who Shocked the World |journal=Psychology Today |volume=35 |issue=2 |date=Mar–Apr 2002 |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200203/the-man-who-shocked-the-world}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants who refused to administer the final shocks neither insisted that the experiment be terminated, nor left the room to check the health of the victim without requesting permission to leave, as per Milgram's notes and recollections, when fellow psychologist [[Philip Zimbardo]] asked him about that point.&lt;ref&gt;Discovering Psychology with Philip Zimbardo Ph.D. Updated Edition, "Power of the Situation," http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6059627757980071729, reference starts at 10min 59 seconds into video.&lt;/ref&gt;

Milgram created a documentary film titled ''Obedience'' showing the experiment and its results. He also produced a series of five social psychology films, some of which dealt with his experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanleymilgram.com/films.php Milgram films.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905054126/http://www.stanleymilgram.com/films.php |date=September 5, 2009 }} Accessed October 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

===Ethics===
The Milgram Shock Experiment raised questions about the [[research ethics]] of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress and [[inflicted insight]] suffered by the participants. Some critics such as Gina Perry argued that participants were not properly debriefed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Perry |first=Gina |date=2013 |title=Deception and Illusion in Milgram's Accounts of the Obedience Experiments |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gina_Perry2/publication/317914282_Deception_and_Illusion_in_Milgram%27s_accounts_of_the_Obedience_Experiments/links/5951ab510f7e9b329234d3c4/Deception-and-Illusion-in-Milgrams-accounts-of-the-Obedience-Experiments.pdf |journal=Theoretical &amp; Applied Ethics, University of Nebraska Press |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=79–92 |doi= |access-date=October 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Milgram's defense, 84 percent of former participants surveyed later said they were "glad" or "very glad" to have participated; 15 percent chose neutral responses (92% of all former participants responding).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milgram|1974|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many later wrote expressing thanks. Milgram repeatedly received offers of assistance and requests to join his staff from former participants. Six years later (at the height of the [[Vietnam War]]), one of the participants in the experiment sent correspondence to Milgram, explaining why he was glad to have participated despite the stress:

{{Quote|While I was a subject in 1964, though I believed that I was hurting someone, I was totally unaware of why I was doing so. Few people ever realize when they are acting according to their own beliefs and when they are meekly submitting to authority&amp;nbsp;... To permit myself to be [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] with the understanding that I am submitting to authority's demand to do something very wrong would make me frightened of myself&amp;nbsp;... I am fully prepared to go to jail if I am not granted [[Conscientious Objector]] status. Indeed, it is the only course I could take to be faithful to what I believe. My only hope is that members of my board act equally according to their conscience&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raiten-D'Antonio, Toni |title=Ugly as Sin: The Truth about How We Look and Finding Freedom from Self-Hatred |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j4ijAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89 |date=1 September 2010 |publisher=HCI |isbn=978-0-7573-1465-0|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milgram|1974|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his book ''[[Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View]]'', Milgram argued that the ethical criticism provoked by his experiments was because his findings were disturbing and revealed unwelcome truths about [[human nature]]. Others have argued that the ethical debate has diverted attention from more serious problems with the experiment's [[methodology]].

===Applicability to the Holocaust===
Milgram sparked direct critical response in the scientific community by claiming that "a common psychological process is centrally involved in both [his laboratory experiments and Nazi Germany] events." [[James Waller]], Chair of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Keene State College, formerly Chair of Whitworth College Psychology Department, expressed the opinion that Milgram experiments ''do not correspond well'' to the Holocaust events:&lt;ref name="Waller-111" /&gt;
# The subjects of Milgram experiments, wrote James Waller (''Becoming Evil''), were assured in advance that ''no permanent physical damage would result from their actions.'' However, the Holocaust perpetrators were fully aware of their hands-on killing and maiming of the victims.
# The laboratory subjects themselves did not know their victims and were not motivated by racism or other biases. On the other hand, the Holocaust perpetrators displayed an ''intense devaluation of the victims'' through a lifetime of personal development.
# Those serving punishment at the lab were not sadists, nor hate-mongers, and often ''exhibited great anguish and conflict'' in the experiment, unlike the designers and executioners of the Final Solution (see [[:Category:Holocaust trials|Holocaust trials]]), who had a clear "goal" on their hands, set beforehand.
# The experiment lasted for an hour, with no time for the subjects to ''contemplate the implications of their behavior''. Meanwhile, the Holocaust lasted for years with ample time for a moral assessment of all individuals and organizations involved.&lt;ref name="Waller-111"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QRHKMa_rqgC&amp;pg=PA111 | title=What Can the Milgram Studies Teach Us... | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | work=Becoming Evil: How Ordinary People Commit Genocide and Mass Killing | date=February 22, 2007 | accessdate=June 9, 2013 | author=[[James Waller]] | pages=111–113 | format=Google Book | isbn=0199774854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of Thomas Blass—who is the author of a scholarly monograph on the experiment (''The Man Who Shocked The World'') published in 2004—the historical evidence pertaining to actions of the Holocaust perpetrators speaks louder than words:

{{Quote|My own view is that Milgram's approach does not provide a fully adequate explanation of the Holocaust. While it may well account for the dutiful destructiveness of the dispassionate bureaucrat who may have shipped Jews to Auschwitz with the same degree of routinization as potatoes to Bremerhaven, it falls short when one tries to apply it to the more zealous, inventive, and hate-driven atrocities that also characterized the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="Blass"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://analyse-und-kritik.net/en/1998-1/AK_Blass_1998.pdf | title=The Roots of Stanley Milgram's Obedience Experiments and Their Relevance to the Holocaust | publisher=Analyse und Kritik.net | year=2013 | accessdate=20 July 2013 | author=Blass, Thomas | format=PDF file, direct download 733 KB | page=51 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190232/http://analyse-und-kritik.net/en/1998-1/AK_Blass_1998.pdf | archivedate=29 October 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Validity===
In a 2004 issue of the journal ''[[Jewish Currents]]'', Joseph Dimow, a participant in the 1961 experiment at Yale University, wrote about his early withdrawal as a "teacher", suspicious "that the whole experiment was designed to see if ordinary Americans would obey immoral orders, as many Germans had done during the Nazi period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dimow |first=Joseph |url=http://www.jewishcurrents.org/2004-jan-dimow.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202065547/https://jewishcurrents.org/2004-jan-dimow.htm |archive-date=February 2, 2004|title=Resisting Authority: A Personal Account of the Milgram Obedience Experiments |journal=Jewish Currents |date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Australian psychologist Gina Perry investigated Milgram's data and writings and concluded that Milgram had manipulated the results, and that there was "troubling mismatch between (published) descriptions of the experiment and evidence of what actually transpired." She wrote that "only half of the people who undertook the experiment fully believed it was real and of those, 66% disobeyed the experimenter".&lt;ref name="perry"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gina |last=Perry |date=April 26, 2012 |title=Behind the Shock Machine: the untold story of the notorious Milgram psychology experiments |publisher=[[The New Press]] |isbn=978-1921844553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lamb120630"&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Lamb |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/the-shocking-truth-of-psychologist-stanley-milgrams-create-a-nazi-experiment/news-story/f0fa43783268a32ab95d2795c848047f |title=Review: The shocking truth of psychologist Stanley Milgram's create-a-Nazi experiment |work=[[The Australian]] |date=June 30, 2012 |accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She described her findings as "an unexpected outcome" that "leaves social psychology in a difficult situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |interviewer=[[NPR]] Staff |first=Gena |last=Perry |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/08/28/209559002/taking-a-closer-look-at-milgrams-shocking-obedience-study |title=Taking A Closer Look At Milgram's Shocking Obedience Study |publisher=[[NPR]] |work=All Things Considered |date=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
Milgram elaborated two theories:
* The first is the ''theory of conformism'', based on [[Asch conformity experiments|Solomon Asch conformity experiments]], describing the fundamental relationship between the group of reference and the individual person. A subject who has neither ability nor expertise to make decisions, especially in a crisis, will leave decision making to the group and its hierarchy. The group is the person's behavioral model.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=June 2017}}
* The second is the ''[[Agency (philosophy)|agentic]] state theory'', wherein, per Milgram, "the essence of obedience consists in the fact that a person comes to view themselves as the instrument for carrying out another person's wishes, and they therefore no longer see themselves as responsible for their actions. Once this critical shift of viewpoint has occurred in the person, all of the essential features of obedience follow".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Nissani  | first1 =Moti  | year = 1990 | title = A Cognitive Reinterpretation of Stanley Milgram's Observations on Obedience to Authority | url = http://www.is.wayne.edu/mnissani/PAGEPUB/milgram.htm | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 45 | issue =  | pages = 1384–1385 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.45.12.1384 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130205025321/http://www.is.wayne.edu/mnissani/PAGEPUB/milgram.htm | archivedate = February 5, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative interpretations===
In his book ''Irrational Exuberance'', Yale finance professor [[Robert J. Shiller]] argues that other factors might be partially able to explain the Milgram Experiments:

{{Quote|[People] have learned that when experts tell them something is all right, it probably is, even if it does not seem so.  (In fact, the experimenter was indeed correct: it ''was'' all right to continue giving the "shocks"—even though most of the subjects did not suspect the reason.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Shiller, Robert |title=Irrational Exuberance |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton NJ |year=2005 |page=158 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 2006 experiment, a computerized [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] was used in place of the learner receiving electrical shocks.  Although the participants administering the shocks were aware that the learner was unreal, the experimenters reported that participants responded to the situation physiologically "as if it were real".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Slater M, Antley A, Davison A, etal |editor1-last=Rustichini |editor1-first=Aldo |title=A virtual reprise of the Stanley Milgram obedience experiments |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=1 |issue= 1|pages=e39 |year=2006 |pmid=17183667 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000039 |pmc=1762398}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; of Milgram's results invokes [[belief perseverance]] as the underlying cause. What "people cannot be counted on is to realize that a seemingly benevolent authority is in fact malevolent, even when they are faced with overwhelming evidence which suggests that this authority is indeed malevolent. Hence, the underlying cause for the subjects' striking conduct could well be conceptual, and not the alleged 'capacity of man to abandon his humanity&amp;nbsp;... as he merges his unique personality into larger institutional structures."'

This last explanation receives some support from a 2009 episode of the [[BBC]] science documentary series ''[[Horizon (UK TV series)|Horizon]]'', which involved replication of the Milgram experiment. Of the twelve participants, only three refused to continue to the end of the experiment. Speaking during the episode, social psychologist Clifford Stott discussed the influence that the idealism of scientific inquiry had on the volunteers. He remarked: "The influence is ideological. It's about what they believe science to be, that science is a positive product, it produces beneficial findings and knowledge to society that are helpful for society. So there's that sense of science is providing some kind of system for good."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=How Violent Are You?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00kk4bz|accessdate=May 8, 2013|series=Horizon|serieslink=Horizon (BBC TV series)|credits=Presenter: [[Michael Portillo]]. Producer: Diene Petterle.|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Two]]|date=May 12, 2009|seriesno=45|number=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the importance of idealism, some recent researchers suggest the 'engaged [[followership]]' perspective. Based on an examination of Milgram's archive, in a recent study, social psychologists [[Alexander Haslam]], [[Stephen Reicher]] and Megan Birney, at the [[University of Queensland]], discovered that people are less likely to follow the prods of an experimental leader when the prod resembles an order.

==Replications and variations==

===Milgram's variations===
In ''[[Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View]]'' (1974), Milgram describes nineteen variations of his experiment, some of which had not been previously reported.

Several experiments varied the distance between the participant (teacher) and the learner. Generally, when the participant was physically closer to the learner, the participant's [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] decreased. In the variation where the learner's physical immediacy was closest, where the participant had to hold the learner's arm onto a shock plate, 30 percent of participants completed the experiment. The participant's compliance also decreased if the experimenter was physically further away (Experiments 1–4). For example, in Experiment 2, where participants received telephonic instructions from the experimenter, compliance decreased to 21 percent. Some participants deceived the experimenter by ''pretending'' to continue the experiment.

In Experiment 8, an all-female contingent was used; previously, all participants had been men. Obedience did not significantly differ, though the women communicated experiencing higher levels of stress.

Experiment 10 took place in a modest office in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]], purporting to be the commercial entity "Research Associates of Bridgeport" without apparent connection to Yale University, to eliminate the university's prestige as a possible factor influencing the participants' behavior. In those conditions, obedience dropped to 47.5 percent, though the difference was not statistically significant.

Milgram also combined the effect of authority with that of [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]]. In those experiments, the participant was joined by one or two additional "teachers" (also actors, like the "learner"). The behavior of the participants' peers strongly affected the results. In Experiment 17, when two additional teachers refused to comply, only 4 of 40 participants continued in the experiment. In Experiment 18, the participant performed a subsidiary task (reading the questions via microphone or recording the learner's answers) with another "teacher" who complied fully. In that variation, 37 of 40 continued with the experiment.&lt;ref name=old&gt;[http://www.stanleymilgram.com/oldanswers.html Milgram, old answers.] Accessed October 4, 2006.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430145531/http://www.stanleymilgram.com/oldanswers.html |date=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of the release of ''Obedience to Authority'' in 1973–1974, a version of the experiment was conducted at [[La Trobe University]] in Australia. As reported by Perry in her 2012 book ''Behind the Shock Machine'', some of the participants experienced long-lasting psychological effects, possibly due to the lack of proper debriefing by the experimenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2002, the British artist [[Rod Dickinson]] created ''The Milgram Re-enactment'', an exact reconstruction of parts of the original experiment, including the uniforms, lighting, and rooms used. An audience watched the four-hour performance through one-way glass windows.&lt;ref&gt;''History Will Repeat Itself: Strategies of Re-enactment in Contemporary (Media) Art and Performance'', ed. Inke Arns, Gabriele Horn, Frankfurt: Verlag, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milgramreenactment.org|title=The Milgram Re-enactment|accessdate=June 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A video of this performance was first shown at the CCA Gallery in [[Glasgow]] in 2002.

A partial replication of the experiment was staged by British illusionist [[Derren Brown]] and broadcast on UK's [[Channel 4]] in ''[[The Heist (Derren Brown special)|The Heist]] ''(2006).&lt;ref name=DerrenBrown&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6GxIuljT3w|title=The Milgram Experiment on YouTube|accessdate=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another partial replication of the experiment was conducted by Jerry M. Burger in 2006 and broadcast on the Primetime series ''Basic Instincts''. Burger noted that "current standards for the ethical treatment of participants clearly place Milgram's studies out of bounds." In 2009, Burger was able to receive approval from the [[institutional review board]] by modifying several of the experimental protocols.&lt;ref name=BurgerWP2008&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burger|first=Jerry M.|title=Replicating Milgram: Would People Still Obey Today?|journal=[[American Psychologist]]|year=2008|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-64-1-1.pdf | doi = 10.1037/a0010932|pmid=19209958|volume=64|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burger found obedience rates virtually identical to those reported by Milgram in 1961–62, even while meeting current ethical regulations of informing participants. In addition, half the replication participants were female, and their rate of obedience was virtually identical to that of the male participants. Burger also included a condition in which participants first saw another participant refuse to continue. However, participants in this condition obeyed at the same rate as participants in the base condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[ABC News]] |date=January 3, 2007 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2765416&amp;page=1|title=The Science of Evil|accessdate=January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 French documentary ''[[Le Jeu de la Mort]]'' (''The Game of Death''), researchers recreated the Milgram experiment with an added critique of [[reality television]] by presenting the scenario as a [[game show]] pilot. Volunteers were given €40 and told they would not win any money from the game, as this was only a trial. Only 16 of 80 "contestants" (teachers) chose to end the game before delivering the highest-voltage punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124838091|title=Fake TV Game Show 'Tortures' Man, Shocks France|accessdate=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100317-disturbing-tv-docu-game-tests-limits-small-screen-power-france-game-of-death |title=Fake torture TV 'game show' reveals willingness to obey |date=March 17, 2010 |accessdate=March 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323051311/http://www.france24.com/en/20100317-disturbing-tv-docu-game-tests-limits-small-screen-power-france-game-of-death |archivedate=March 23, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiment was performed on ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' on an episode airing April 25, 2010.

The [[Discovery Channel]] aired the "How Evil are You" segment of ''[[Curiosity (TV series)|Curiosity]]'' on October 30, 2011.  The episode was hosted by [[Eli Roth]], who produced results similar to the original Milgram experiment, though the highest-voltage punishment used was 165 volts, rather than 450 volts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/curiosity/videos/how-evil-are-you.htm |title=Curiosity: How evil are you? |accessdate=April 17, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201125734/http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/curiosity/videos/how-evil-are-you.htm |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to increasingly widespread knowledge of the experiment, recent replications of the procedure have had to ensure that participants were not previously aware of it.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Other variations===
Charles Sheridan and Richard King (at the [[University of Missouri]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], respectively) hypothesized that some of Milgram's subjects may have suspected that the victim was faking, so they repeated the experiment with a real victim: a "cute, fluffy puppy" who was given real, albeit apparently harmless, electric shocks. Their findings were similar to those of Milgram: half of the male subjects and all of the females obeyed throughout. Many subjects showed high levels of distress during the experiment, and some openly wept. In addition, Sheridan and King found that the duration for which the shock button was pressed decreased as the shocks got higher, meaning that for higher shock levels, subjects were more hesitant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.holah.co.uk/files/sheridan_king_1972.pdf |title=Sheridan &amp; King (1972) – Obedience to authority with an authentic victim, Proceedings of the 80th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association 7: 165–6. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127071012/http://www.holah.co.uk/files/sheridan_king_1972.pdf |archive-date=January 27, 2018 |access-date=March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blass|1999|p=968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Molecular nanotechnology''' ('''MNT''') is a technology based on the ability to build structures to complex, atomic specifications by means of [[mechanosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/glossary/glossary_n.html#Nanotechnology |title=Nanosystems Glossary |publisher=E-drexler.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is distinct from [[Nanomaterials|nanoscale materials]].  Based on [[Richard Feynman]]'s vision of miniature factories using nanomachines to build complex products ([[self-replicating machine|including additional nanomachines]]), this advanced form of [[nanotechnology]] (or ''molecular manufacturing''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wise-nano.org/w/Doing_MM |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051108122214/http://wise-nano.org/w/Doing_MM |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-11-08 |title=Doing MM |publisher=Wise Nano |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2010-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) would make use of positionally-controlled mechanosynthesis guided by [[molecular machine]] systems. MNT would involve combining physical principles demonstrated by [[biophysics]], [[chemistry]], other nanotechnologies, and the [[Biological machine|molecular machinery of life]] with the systems engineering principles found in modern macroscale factories.

==Introduction==

While conventional chemistry uses inexact processes obtaining inexact results, and biology exploits inexact processes to obtain definitive results, molecular nanotechnology would employ original definitive processes to obtain definitive results. The desire in molecular nanotechnology would be to balance molecular reactions in positionally-controlled locations and orientations to obtain desired chemical reactions, and then to build systems by further assembling the products of these reactions.

A roadmap for the development of MNT is an objective of a broadly based technology project led by [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]] (the manager of several U.S. National Laboratories) and the [[Foresight Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foresight.org/cms/press_center/282 |title=Foresight Institute press release |publisher=Foresight.org |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2010-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923024525/http://foresight.org/cms/press_center/282 |archivedate=2010-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The roadmap was originally scheduled for completion by late 2006, but was released in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson |first=Christine |url=http://www.foresight.org/nanodot/?p=2478#more-2478 |title=Nanodot: Nanotechnology News and Discussion » Blog Archive » Nanotechnology Roadmap launch: Productive Nanosystems Conference, Oct 9-10 |publisher=Foresight.org |date=2007-05-08 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nanofactory Collaboration&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory |title=Nanofactory Collaboration |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a more focused ongoing effort involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries that is developing a practical research agenda&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/Challenges.htm |title=Nanofactory Technical Challenges |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically aimed at positionally-controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and diamondoid nanofactory development. In August 2005, a task force consisting of 50+ international experts from various fields was organized by the [http://www.crnano.org/ Center for Responsible Nanotechnology] to study the societal implications of molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crnano.org|title=Global Task Force on Implications and Policy |publisher=Crnano.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projected applications and capabilities==

===Smart materials and nanosensors===
One proposed application of MNT is so-called [[smart material]]s.  This term refers to any sort of material designed and engineered at the [[nanometer]] scale for a specific task. It encompasses a wide variety of possible commercial applications.  One example would be materials designed to respond differently to various molecules; such a capability could lead, for example, to artificial drugs which would recognize and render inert specific [[viruses]].  Another is the idea of [[Self-healing material|self-healing structures]], which would [[Regeneration (biology)|repair]] small tears in a surface naturally in the same way as self-sealing tires or human skin.

A MNT nanosensor would resemble a smart material, involving a small component within a larger machine that would react to its environment and change in some fundamental, intentional way.  A very simple example: a photosensor might passively measure the incident light and discharge its absorbed energy as electricity when the light passes above or below a specified threshold, sending a signal to a larger machine.  Such a sensor would supposedly cost less and use less power than a conventional sensor, and yet function usefully in all the same applications &amp;mdash; for example, turning on parking lot lights when it gets dark.

While smart materials and nanosensors both exemplify useful applications of MNT, they pale in comparison with the complexity of the technology most popularly associated with the term: the replicating [[nanorobot]].

===Replicating nanorobots===

MNT nanofacturing is popularly linked with the idea of [[swarm intelligence|swarm]]s of coordinated nanoscale robots working together, a popularization of an early proposal by [[K. Eric Drexler]] in his [[Engines of Creation|1986 discussions of MNT]], but [http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html superseded in 1992]. In this early proposal, sufficiently capable nanorobots would construct more nanorobots in an artificial environment containing special molecular building blocks.

Critics have doubted both the feasibility of self-replicating [[nanorobot]]s and the feasibility of control if self-replicating nanorobots could be achieved: they cite the possibility of [[mutation]]s removing any control and favoring reproduction of mutant pathogenic variations.  Advocates address the first doubt by pointing out that the first macroscale autonomous machine replicator, made of [[Lego blocks]], was built and operated experimentally in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.23.4.htm |title=3.23.4 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While there are sensory advantages present at the macroscale compared to the limited sensorium available at the nanoscale, proposals for positionally controlled nanoscale mechanosynthetic fabrication systems employ dead reckoning of tooltips combined with reliable reaction sequence design to ensure reliable results, hence a limited sensorium is no handicap;  similar considerations apply to the positional assembly of small nanoparts.  Advocates address the second doubt by arguing that [[bacterium|bacteria]] are (of necessity) evolved to evolve, while nanorobot mutation could be actively prevented by common [[Error-correction|error-correcting]] techniques. Similar ideas are advocated in the Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/index.html |title=Molecular Nanotechnology Guidelines |publisher=Foresight.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a map of the 137-dimensional replicator design space&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.9.htm |title=5.1.9 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; recently published by Freitas and Merkle provides numerous proposed methods by which replicators could, in principle, be safely controlled by good design.

However, the concept of suppressing mutation raises the question: How can design evolution occur at the nanoscale without a process of random mutation and deterministic selection? Critics argue that MNT advocates have not provided a substitute for such a process of evolution in this nanoscale arena where conventional sensory-based selection processes are lacking.  The limits of the sensorium available at the nanoscale could make it difficult or impossible to winnow successes from failures.  Advocates argue that design evolution should occur deterministically and strictly under human control, using the conventional engineering paradigm of modeling, design, prototyping, testing, analysis, and redesign.

In any event, since 1992 [http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html technical proposals for MNT] do not include self-replicating nanorobots, and recent ethical guidelines put forth by MNT advocates prohibit unconstrained self-replication.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/MMDangerous.pdf |title=N04FR06-p.15.pmd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical nanorobots===

One of the most important applications of MNT would be medical [[nanorobotics]] or [[nanomedicine]], an area pioneered by [[Robert Freitas]] in numerous books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanomedicine.com |title=NanomedicineBookSite |publisher=Nanomedicine.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/NanoPubls.htm |title=NanoPubls |publisher=Rfreitas.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to design, build, and deploy large numbers of medical nanorobots would, at a minimum, make possible the rapid elimination of disease and the reliable and relatively painless recovery from physical trauma.  Medical nanorobots might also make possible the convenient correction of genetic defects, and help to ensure a greatly expanded lifespan.  More controversially, medical nanorobots might be used to [[Human enhancement|augment natural human capabilities]]. One study has reported on the conditions like tumors, [[arteriosclerosis]], [[blood clots]] leading to stroke, accumulation of scar tissue and localized pockets of infection can be possibly be addressed by employing medical nanorobots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT8/Papers/Rubinstein/|title=NanoRobot for Treatment of Various Medical Problems|website=www.foresight.org|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saadeh|first=Yamaan|last2=Vyas|first2=Dinesh|date=June 2014|title=Nanorobotic Applications in Medicine: Current Proposals and Designs|journal=American journal of robotic surgery|volume=1|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1166/ajrs.2014.1010|issn=2374-0612|pmc=4562685|pmid=26361635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility fog===

[[Image:Foglet.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a 100 micrometer foglet]]
Another proposed application of molecular nanotechnology is "[[utility fog]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discuss.foresight.org/~josh/Ufog.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111094117/http://discuss.foresight.org/%7Ejosh/Ufog.html |archivedate=2006-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; in which a cloud of networked microscopic robots (simpler than [[Molecular assembler|assembler]]s) would change its shape and properties to form macroscopic objects and tools in accordance with software commands.  Rather than modify the current practices of consuming material goods in different forms, utility fog would simply replace many physical objects.

===Phased-array optics===

Yet another proposed application of MNT would be [[phased-array optics]] (PAO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phased-array.com |title=Phased Array Optics |publisher=Phased-array.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this appears to be a problem addressable by ordinary nanoscale technology. PAO would use the principle of phased-array millimeter technology but at optical wavelengths.  This would permit the duplication of any sort of optical effect but virtually.  Users could request holograms, sunrises and sunsets, or floating lasers as the mood strikes.  PAO systems were described in BC Crandall's ''Nanotechnology:  Molecular Speculations on Global Abundance'' in the [[Brian Wowk]] article "Phased-Array Optics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phased-array.com/1996-Book-Chapter.html |title=Phased Array Optics |publisher=Phased-array.com |date=1991-10-03 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential social impacts==

[[Molecular manufacturing]] is a potential future subfield of nanotechnology that would make it possible to  build complex structures at atomic precision.&lt;ref name="Foresight nano FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Molecular Manufacturing|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/whatismm.html|website=foresight.org|accessdate=19 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426045511/http://www.foresight.org/nano/whatismm.html|archivedate=26 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular manufacturing requires significant advances in nanotechnology, but once achieved could produce highly advanced products at low costs and in large quantities in nanofactories weighing a kilogram or more.&lt;ref name="Foresight nano FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; When nanofactories gain the ability to produce other nanofactories production may only be limited by relatively abundant factors such as input materials, energy and software.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

The products of molecular manufacturing could range from cheaper, mass-produced versions of known high-tech products to novel products with added capabilities in many areas of application. Some applications that have been suggested are advanced [[smart materials]], nanosensors, medical nanorobots and space travel.&lt;ref name="Foresight nano FAQ"/&gt; Additionally, molecular manufacturing could be used to cheaply produce highly advanced, durable weapons, which is an area of special concern regarding the impact of nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Phoenix|author2=Mike Treder|editor1-last=Bostrom|editor1-first=Nick|editor2-last=Cirkovic|editor2-first=Milan M.|title=Global catastrophic risks|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-857050-9|chapter=Chapter 21: Nanotechnology as global catastrophic risk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Being equipped with compact computers and motors these could be increasingly autonomous and have a large range of capabilities.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

According to Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder from the [[Center for Responsible Nanotechnology]] as well as Anders Sandberg from the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] molecular manufacturing is the application of nanotechnology that poses the most significant [[global catastrophic risk]].&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sandberg xrisk"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sandberg |first1=Anders |title=The five biggest threats to human existence |url=http://theconversation.com/the-five-biggest-threats-to-human-existence-27053|website=http://theconversation.com/ |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several nanotechnology researchers state that the bulk of risk from nanotechnology comes from the potential to lead to war, arms races and destructive global government.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandberg xrisk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drexler|first1=Eric|title=A Dialog on Dangers |url=http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Background3.html#DangerDialog|website=foresight.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reasons have been suggested why the availability of nanotech weaponry may with significant likelihood lead to unstable arms races (compared to e.g. nuclear arms races): (1) A large number of players may be tempted to enter the race since the threshold for doing so is low;&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; (2) the ability to make weapons with molecular manufacturing will be cheap and easy to hide;&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; (3) therefore lack of insight into the other parties' capabilities can tempt players to arm out of caution or to launch preemptive strikes;&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drexler|first1=Eric|title=ENGINES OF DESTRUCTION  (Chapter 11)|url=http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_11.html|website=http://e-drexler.com/|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (4) molecular manufacturing may reduce dependency on international trade,&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; a potential peace-promoting factor;&lt;ref name="Tomasik promote compr"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasik|first1=Brian|title=Possible Ways to Promote Compromise|url=http://foundational-research.org/publications/possible-ways-to-promote-compromise/#Democracy_trade_and_social_stability|website=http://foundational-research.org/|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (5) [[wars of aggression]] may pose a smaller economic threat to the aggressor since manufacturing is cheap and humans may not be needed on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

Since self-regulation by all state and non-state actors seems hard to achieve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dangers of Molecular Manufacturing|url=http://www.crnano.org/dangers.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; measures to mitigate war-related risks have mainly been proposed in the area of [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]].&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "crnano int control"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Need for International Control|url=http://www.crnano.org/int_control.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; International infrastructure may be expanded giving more sovereignty to the international level. This could help coordinate efforts for arms control.&lt;ref name="Tomasik co-op vs arms race"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasik|first1=Brian|title=International Cooperation vs. AI Arms Race|url=http://foundational-research.org/publications/international-cooperation-vs-ai-arms-race/#Nanotech_arms_races|website=foundational-research.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; International institutions dedicated specifically to nanotechnology (perhaps analogously to the International Atomic Energy Agency [[IAEA]]) or general arms control may also be designed.&lt;ref name = "crnano int control"/&gt; One may also jointly make [[Differential technological development|differential technological progress]] on defensive technologies, a policy that players should usually favour.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology also suggest some technical restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical Restrictions May Make Nanotechnology Safer|url=http://www.crnano.org/restrictions.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improved transparency regarding technological capabilities may be another important facilitator for arms-control.&lt;ref name="Tomasik promote compr 2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasik|first1=Brian|title=Possible Ways to Promote Compromise|url=http://foundational-research.org/publications/possible-ways-to-promote-compromise/#Transparency_social_capital_and_karma|website=http://foundational-research.org/|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[grey goo]] is another catastrophic scenario, which was proposed by [[K. Eric Drexler|Eric Drexler]] in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of Creation]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Apocalypse 2012 |last= Joseph |first= Lawrence E. |year= 2007 |publisher= Broadway |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-7679-2448-1 |page= 6 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been analyzed by Freitas in "Some Limits to Global Ecophagy by Biovorous Nanoreplicators, with Public Policy Recommendations" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.foresight.org/nano/Ecophagy.html&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a theme in mainstream media and fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3788673.stm| title=Nanotech guru turns back on 'goo'| publisher= BBC News|accessdate=2012-03-30|first=Paul|last=Rincon|date=2004-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hapgood |first=Fred |date=November 1986 |title=Nanotechnology: Molecular Machines that Mimic Life |url=http://metamodern.com/b/wp-content/uploads/docs/OMNI_TINYTECH.pdf |journal=Omni |accessdate=19 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This scenario involves tiny self-replicating robots that consume the entire biosphere using it as a source of energy and building blocks.  Nanotech experts including Drexler now discredit the scenario. According to  [[Chris Phoenix (nanotechnologist)|Chris Phoenix]] a "So-called grey goo could only be the product of a deliberate and difficult engineering process, not an accident".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leading nanotech experts put 'grey goo' in perspective|url=http://www.crnano.org/PR-IOP.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of nano-biotech, a different scenario called [[green goo]] has been forwarded. Here, the malignant substance is not nanobots but rather self-replicating biological [[organism]]s engineered through nanotechnology.

===Benefits===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nanotechnology (or molecular nanotechnology to refer more specifically to the goals discussed here) will let us continue the historical trends in manufacturing right up to the fundamental limits imposed by physical law. It will let us make remarkably powerful molecular computers. It will let us make materials over fifty times lighter than steel or aluminium alloy but with the same strength. We'll be able to make jets, rockets, cars or even chairs that, by today's standards, would be remarkably light, strong, and inexpensive. Molecular surgical tools, guided by molecular computers and injected into the blood stream could find and destroy cancer cells or invading bacteria, unclog arteries, or provide oxygen when the circulation is impaired.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nanotechnology will replace our entire manufacturing base with a new, radically more precise, radically less expensive, and radically more flexible way of making products. The aim is not simply to replace today's computer chip making plants, but also to replace the assembly lines for cars, televisions, telephones, books, surgical tools, missiles, bookcases, airplanes, tractors, and all the rest. The objective is a pervasive change in manufacturing, a change that will leave virtually no product untouched. Economic progress and military readiness in the 21st Century will depend fundamentally on maintaining a competitive position in nanotechnology.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the current early developmental status of nanotechnology and molecular nanotechnology,  much concern surrounds MNT's anticipated impact on [[economics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/NoninflationaryPN.pdf |title=N20FR06-p._.pmd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lifeboat.com/ex/corporate.cornucopia&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[law]]. Whatever the exact effects, MNT, if achieved, would tend to reduce the [[scarcity]] of manufactured goods and make many more goods (such as food and health aids) manufacturable.

MNT should make possible [[Nanomedicine|nanomedical]] capabilities able to cure any medical condition not already cured by advances in other areas. Good health would be common, and poor health of any form would be as rare as [[smallpox]] and [[scurvy]] are today. Even [[cryonics]] would be feasible, as [[cryopreserved]] tissue could be fully repaired.

===Risks===
Molecular nanotechnology is one of the technologies that some analysts believe could lead to a [[technological singularity]].
Some feel that molecular nanotechnology would have daunting risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crnano.org/dangers.htm |title=Nanotechnology: Dangers of Molecular Manufacturing |publisher=Crnano.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It conceivably could enable cheaper and more destructive conventional [[weapon]]s.  Also, molecular nanotechnology might permit [[weapons of mass destruction]] that could self-replicate, as [[virus (biology)|virus]]es and [[cancer]] cells do when attacking the human body. Commentators generally agree that, in the event molecular nanotechnology were developed, its [[self-replication]] should be permitted only under very controlled or "inherently safe" conditions.

A fear exists that nanomechanical robots, if achieved, and if designed to self-replicate using naturally occurring materials (a difficult task), could consume the entire planet in their hunger for raw materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/Ecophagy.htm |title=Some Limits to Global Ecophagy |publisher=Rfreitas.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply crowd out natural life, out-competing it for energy (as happened historically when [[blue-green algae]] appeared and outcompeted earlier life forms).  Some commentators have referred to this situation as the "[[grey goo]]" or "[[ecophagy]]" scenario.  [[K. Eric Drexler]] considers an accidental "grey goo" scenario extremely unlikely and says so in later editions of ''Engines of Creation''.

In light of this perception of potential danger, the [[Foresight Institute]], founded by Drexler, has prepared a set of guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/current.html |title=Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology |publisher=Foresight.org |date=2006-04-06 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the ethical development of nanotechnology.  These include the banning of free-foraging self-replicating pseudo-organisms on the Earth's surface, at least, and possibly in other places.

==Technical issues and criticism==
The feasibility of the basic technologies analyzed in ''Nanosystems'' has been the subject of a formal scientific review by U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and has also been the focus of extensive debate on the internet and in the popular press.

===Study and recommendations by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences===

In 2006, U.S. National Academy of Sciences released the report of a study of molecular manufacturing as part of a longer report, ''A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative''&lt;ref name="nanotechnology1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11752.html |title=A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study committee reviewed the technical content of ''Nanosystems'', and in its conclusion states that no current theoretical analysis can be considered definitive regarding several questions of potential system performance, and that optimal paths for implementing high-performance systems cannot be predicted with confidence. It recommends experimental research to advance knowledge in this area:

:"Although theoretical calculations can be made today, the eventually attainable range of chemical reaction cycles, error rates, speed of operation, and thermodynamic efficiencies of such bottom-up manufacturing systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Thus, the eventually attainable perfection and complexity of manufactured products, while they can be calculated in theory, cannot be predicted with confidence. Finally, the optimum research paths that might lead to systems which greatly exceed the thermodynamic efficiencies and other capabilities of biological systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Research funding that is based on the ability of investigators to produce experimental demonstrations that link to abstract models and guide long-term vision is most appropriate to achieve this goal."

===Assemblers versus nanofactories===
A section heading in Drexler's ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' reads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Cover.html |title=Engines of Creation - K. Eric Drexler : Cover |publisher=E-drexler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Universal Assemblers", and the following text speaks of multiple types of [[Assembler (nanotechnology)|assemblers]] which, collectively, could hypothetically "build almost anything that the laws of nature allow to exist." Drexler's colleague [[Ralph Merkle]] has noted that, contrary to widespread legend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/impact/impossible.html#Fear |title=How good scientists reach bad conclusions |publisher=Foresight.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drexler never claimed that assembler systems could build absolutely any molecular structure. The endnotes in Drexler's book explain the qualification "almost": "For example, a delicate structure might be designed that, like a stone arch, would self-destruct unless all its pieces were already in place. If there were no room in the design for the placement and removal of a scaffolding, then the structure might be impossible to build. Few structures of practical interest seem likely to exhibit such a problem, however."

In 1992, Drexler published ''Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html |title=Nanosystems TOC |publisher=E-drexler.com |date=2002-11-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a detailed proposal for synthesizing stiff covalent structures using a table-top factory. [[Diamondoid]] structures and other stiff covalent structures, if achieved, would have a wide range of possible applications, going far beyond current [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] technology. An outline of a path was put forward in 1992 for building a table-top factory in the absence of an assembler. Other researchers have begun advancing tentative, alternative proposed paths &lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; for this in the years since Nanosystems was published.

===Hard versus soft nanotechnology===
In 2004 [http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/ Richard Jones] wrote Soft Machines (nanotechnology and life), a book for lay audiences published by [[Oxford University]]. In this book he describes radical nanotechnology (as advocated by Drexler) as a deterministic/mechanistic idea of nano engineered  machines that does not take into account the nanoscale challenges such as [[wetness]], [[Adhesion|stickiness]], [[Brownian motion]], and high [[viscosity]]. He also explains what is soft nanotechnology or more appropriatelly [[biomimetic]] nanotechnology which is the way forward, if not the best way, to design functional nanodevices that can cope with all the problems at a nanoscale. One can think of soft nanotechnology as the development of nanomachines that uses the lessons learned from biology on how things work, chemistry to precisely engineer such devices and stochastic physics to model the system and its natural processes in detail.

===The Smalley-Drexler debate===
{{main|Drexler–Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology}}

Several researchers, including Nobel Prize winner [[Richard Smalley|Dr. Richard Smalley]] (1943–2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=F90C4210-C153-4B2F-83A1-28F2012B637|date=September 2001| journal=Scientific American| title=Of Chemistry, Love and Nanobots| first= Richard E.| last= Smalley|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0901-76| volume=285| pages=76–77| bibcode=2001SciAm.285c..76S}}&lt;/ref&gt; attacked the notion of universal assemblers, leading to a rebuttal from Drexler and colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/SciAmDebate2/smalley.php |title=Debate About Assemblers — Smalley Rebuttal |publisher=Imm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually to an exchange of letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=C&amp;En: Cover Story - Nanotechnology |publisher=Pubs.acs.org |date=2003-12-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smalley argued that chemistry is extremely complicated, reactions are hard to control, and that a universal assembler is science fiction. Drexler and colleagues, however, noted that Drexler never proposed universal assemblers able to make absolutely anything, but instead proposed more limited assemblers able to make a very wide variety of things. They challenged the relevance of Smalley's arguments to the more specific proposals advanced in ''Nanosystems''.  Also, Smalley argued that nearly all of modern chemistry involves reactions that take place in a [[solvent]] (usually [[water]]), because the [[small molecules]] of a solvent contribute many things, such as lowering [[binding energies]] for transition states.  Since nearly all known chemistry requires a solvent, Smalley felt that Drexler's proposal to use a high vacuum environment was not feasible.  However, Drexler addresses this in Nanosystems by showing mathematically that well designed [[catalysts]] can provide the effects of a solvent and can fundamentally be made even more efficient than a solvent/[[enzyme]] reaction could ever be. It is noteworthy that, contrary to Smalley's opinion that enzymes require water, "Not only do enzymes work vigorously in anhydrous organic media, but in this unnatural milieu they acquire remarkable properties such as greatly enhanced stability, radically altered substrate and [[enantiomeric]] specificities, molecular memory, and the ability to catalyse unusual reactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Enzymatic catalysis in anhydrous organic solvents.|date=April 1989 | pmid=2658221 | doi=10.1016/0968-0004(89)90146-1|volume=14|journal=Trends Biochem Sci|pages=141–4 | last1 = Klibanov | first1 = AM}}"{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC397741/pdf/pnas00350-0138.pdf|title=Enzymatic catalysis in anhydrous organic solvents|date=April 1989 | pmc=397741|pmid=3858815|volume=82|journal=Proc.

===Redefining of the word "nanotechnology"===
For the future, some means have to be found for MNT design evolution at the nanoscale which mimics the process of biological evolution at the molecular scale. Biological evolution proceeds by random variation in ensemble averages of organisms combined with culling of the less-successful variants and reproduction of the more-successful variants, and macroscale engineering design also proceeds by a process of design evolution from simplicity to complexity as set forth somewhat satirically by [[John Gall (author)|John Gall]]: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.  . . . A complex system designed from scratch never works and can not be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a system that works." &lt;ref name="JohGall"&gt;
Gall, John, (1986) Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail, 2nd ed. Ann Arbor, MI : The General Systemantics Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A breakthrough in MNT is needed which proceeds from the simple atomic ensembles which can be built with, e.g., an STM to complex MNT systems via a process of design evolution. A handicap in this process is the difficulty of seeing and manipulation at the nanoscale compared to the macroscale which makes deterministic selection of successful trials difficult; in contrast biological evolution proceeds via action of what Richard Dawkins has called the "blind watchmaker"
&lt;ref name = "Dawkins"&gt;
Richard Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design, W. W. Norton; Reissue edition (September 19, 1996)
&lt;/ref&gt; 
comprising random molecular variation and deterministic reproduction/extinction.

At present in 2007 the practice of nanotechnology embraces both stochastic approaches (in which, for example, [[supramolecular chemistry]] creates waterproof pants) and deterministic approaches wherein single molecules (created by stochastic chemistry) are manipulated on substrate surfaces (created by stochastic deposition methods) by deterministic methods comprising nudging them with [[scanning tunneling microscope|STM]] or [[Atomic force microscope|AFM]] probes and causing simple binding or cleavage reactions to occur. The dream of a complex, deterministic molecular nanotechnology remains elusive.  Since the mid-1990s, thousands of surface scientists and thin film technocrats have latched on to the nanotechnology bandwagon and redefined their disciplines as nanotechnology.  This has caused much confusion in the field and has spawned thousands of "nano"-papers on the peer reviewed literature.  Most of these reports are extensions of the more ordinary research done in the parent fields.

===The feasibility of the proposals in ''Nanosystems''===
{{Multiple image

|image1 = Molecularpropeller.jpg
|image2 = Nanob.jpg
|footer = Top, a molecular propellor. Bottom, a molecular [[planetary gear]] system. The feasibility of devices like these has been questioned.}}

The feasibility of Drexler's proposals largely depends, therefore, on whether designs like those in ''Nanosystems'' could be built in the absence of a universal assembler to build them and would work as described. Supporters of molecular nanotechnology frequently claim that no significant errors have been discovered in ''Nanosystems'' since 1992. Even some critics concede&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/index.php?p=50#comment-523 |title=Blog Archive » Is mechanosynthesis feasible? The debate moves up a gear |publisher=Soft Machines |date=2004-12-16 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "Drexler has carefully considered a number of physical principles underlying the 'high level' aspects of the nanosystems he proposes and, indeed, has thought in some detail" about some issues.

Other critics claim, however, that ''Nanosystems'' omits important chemical details about the low-level 'machine language' of molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/drexler.html |title=Smalley |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanotech-now.com/Atkinson-Phoenix-Nanotech-Debate.htm |title=Atkinson |publisher=Nanotech-now.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/index.php?p=70 |title=Moriarty |publisher=Softmachines.org |date=2005-01-26 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/?p=175 |title=Jones |publisher=Softmachines.org |date=2005-12-18 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that much of the other low-level chemistry in ''Nanosystems'' requires extensive further work, and that Drexler's higher-level designs therefore rest on speculative foundations.  Recent such further work by Freitas and Merkle &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/Publications.htm |title=Nanofactory Collaboration Publications |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is aimed at strengthening these foundations by filling the existing gaps in the low-level chemistry.

Drexler argues that we may need to wait until our conventional [[nanotechnology]] improves before solving these issues: "Molecular manufacturing will result from a series of advances in molecular machine systems, much as the first Moon landing resulted from a series of advances in liquid-fuel [[rocket]] systems. We are now in a position like that of the [[British Interplanetary Society]] of the 1930s which described how multistage liquid-fueled rockets could reach the Moon and pointed to early rockets as illustrations of the basic principle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softmachines.org/PDFs/Moriarty_Phoenix_1.pdf |title=Moriarity Correspondence |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Freitas and Merkle argue &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/index.htm#NeedFund |title=Nanofactory Collaboration |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a focused effort to achieve diamond mechanosynthesis (DMS) can begin now, using existing technology, and might achieve success in less than a decade if their "direct-to-DMS approach is pursued rather than a more circuitous development approach that seeks to implement less efficacious nondiamondoid molecular manufacturing technologies before progressing to diamondoid".

To summarize the arguments against feasibility:  First, critics argue that a primary barrier to achieving molecular nanotechnology is the lack of an efficient way to create machines on a molecular/atomic scale, especially in the absence of a well-defined path toward a self-replicating assembler or diamondoid nanofactory. Advocates respond that a preliminary research path leading to a diamondoid nanofactory is being developed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

A second difficulty in reaching molecular nanotechnology is design.  Hand design of a gear or bearing at the level of atoms might take a few to several weeks. While Drexler, Merkle and others have created designs of simple parts, no comprehensive design effort for anything approaching the complexity of a Model T Ford has been attempted.  Advocates respond that it is difficult to undertake a comprehensive design effort in the absence of significant funding for such efforts, and that despite this handicap much useful design-ahead has nevertheless been accomplished with new software tools that have been developed, e.g., at Nanorex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nanoengineer-1.com/content/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=40&amp;Itemid=50 |title=Nanorex, Inc. - Molecular Machinery Gallery |publisher=Nanoengineer-1.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latest report ''A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative''&lt;ref name="nanotechnology1"/&gt; put out by the National Academies Press in December 2006 (roughly twenty years after Engines of Creation was published), no clear way forward toward molecular nanotechnology could yet be seen, as per the conclusion on page 108 of that report: "Although theoretical calculations can be made today, the eventually attainable
range of chemical reaction cycles, error rates, speed of operation, and thermodynamic
efficiencies of such bottom-up manufacturing systems cannot be reliably
predicted at this time. Thus, the eventually attainable perfection and complexity of
manufactured products, while they can be calculated in theory, cannot be predicted
with confidence. Finally, the optimum research paths that might lead to systems
which greatly exceed the thermodynamic efficiencies and other capabilities of
biological systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Research funding that
is based on the ability of investigators to produce experimental demonstrations
that link to abstract models and guide long-term vision is most appropriate to
achieve this goal." This call for research leading to demonstrations is welcomed by groups such as the Nanofactory Collaboration who are specifically seeking experimental successes in diamond mechanosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/DMS.htm |title=Diamond Mechanosynthesis |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Technology Roadmap for [[Productive nanosystems|Productive Nanosystems]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/roadmaps |title=Technology Roadmap for Productive Nanosystems |publisher=Foresight.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to offer additional constructive insights.

It is perhaps interesting to ask whether or not most structures consistent with physical law can in fact be manufactured.  Advocates assert that to achieve most of the vision of molecular manufacturing it is not necessary to be able to build "any structure that is compatible with natural law." Rather, it is necessary to be able to build only a sufficient (possibly modest) subset of such structures—as is true, in fact, of any practical manufacturing process used in the world today, and is true even in biology. In any event, as [[Richard Feynman]] once said, "It is scientific only to say what's more likely or less likely, and not to be proving all the time what's possible or impossible."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikiquote:Richard Feynman]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existing work on diamond mechanosynthesis===

There is a growing body of peer-reviewed theoretical work on synthesizing diamond by mechanically removing/adding hydrogen atoms &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Papers/TemelsoHAbst.pdf High-level Ab Initio Studies of Hydrogen Abstraction from Prototype Hydrocarbon Systems].

Freitas, Allis and Merkle. ''J. Comput. Theor. Nanosci.'' Vol. 4, 2007, in press.&lt;/ref&gt; (a process known as [[mechanosynthesis]]). This work is slowly permeating the broader nanoscience community and is being critiqued.  For instance, Peng et al. (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Papers/JCTNPengFeb06.pdf |title=03CTN01-003 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in the continuing research effort by Freitas, Merkle and their collaborators) reports that the most-studied mechanosynthesis tooltip motif (DCB6Ge) successfully places a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carbon [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] on a C(110) [[diamond]] surface at both 300&amp;nbsp;K (room temperature) and 80&amp;nbsp;K ([[liquid nitrogen]] temperature), and that the silicon variant (DCB6Si) also works at 80&amp;nbsp;K but not at 300&amp;nbsp;K. Over 100,000 CPU hours were invested in this latest study.  The DCB6 tooltip motif, initially described by Merkle and Freitas at a Foresight Conference in 2002, was the first complete tooltip ever proposed for diamond mechanosynthesis and remains the only tooltip motif that has been successfully simulated for its intended function on a full 200-atom diamond surface.

The tooltips modeled in this work are intended to be used only in carefully controlled environments (e.&amp;nbsp;g., vacuum). Maximum acceptable limits for tooltip translational and rotational misplacement errors are reported in Peng et al. (2006) -- tooltips must be positioned with great accuracy to avoid bonding the dimer incorrectly.  Peng et al. (2006) reports that increasing the handle thickness from 4 support planes of C atoms above the tooltip to 5 planes decreases the resonance frequency of the entire structure from 2.0&amp;nbsp;THz to 1.8&amp;nbsp;THz.  More importantly, the vibrational footprints of a DCB6Ge tooltip mounted on a 384-atom handle and of the same tooltip mounted on a similarly constrained but much larger 636-atom "crossbar" handle are virtually identical in the non-crossbar directions. Additional computational studies modeling still bigger handle structures are welcome, but the ability to precisely position SPM tips to the requisite atomic accuracy has been repeatedly demonstrated experimentally at low temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.uci.edu/~wilsonho/stm-iets.html |title=Wilson Ho |publisher=Physics.uci.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=90|issue=|page=176102|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.176102|bibcode=2003PhRvL..90q6102O|title=Mechanical Vertical Manipulation of Selected Single Atoms by Soft Nanoindentation Using Near Contact Atomic Force Microscopy|pmid=12786084 | last1 = Oyabu | first1 = N | last2 = Custance | first2 = O | last3 = Yi | first3 = I | last4 = Sugawara | first4 = Y | last5 = Morita | first5 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even at room temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=R.

Further research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/AnnBibDMS.htm |title=DMS Bibliography |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; to consider additional tooltips will require time-consuming [[computational chemistry]] and difficult laboratory work.

A working [[nanofactory]] would require a variety of well-designed tips for different reactions, and detailed analyses of placing atoms on more complicated surfaces. Although this appears a challenging problem given current resources, many tools will be available to help future researchers: [[Moore's law]] predicts further increases in computer power, [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|semiconductor fabrication]] techniques continue to approach the nanoscale, and researchers grow ever more skilled at using [[protein]]s, [[ribosome]]s and [[DNA]] to perform novel chemistry.

*In the novel ''Tomorrow'' by Andrew Saltzman ({{ISBN|1-4243-1027-X}}), a scientist uses [[nanorobotics]] to create a liquid that when inserted into the [[bloodstream]], renders one nearly [[wikt:invincible|invincible]] given that the microscopic machines repair tissue almost instantaneously after it is damaged.
*In the [[roleplaying game]] ''[[Splicers]]'' by [[Palladium Books]], humanity has succumbed to a "nanobot plague" that causes any object made of a non-[[precious metal]] to twist and change shape (sometimes into a type of [[robot]]) moments after being touched by a human.  The object will then proceed to attack the human.  This has forced humanity to develop "biotechnological" devices to replace those previously made of metal.

(They are similar to the creatures in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Evolution (TNG episode)|Evolution]]", which featured "nanites" taking over the ''Enterprise''.) The Nanites made their first appearance in season 8. Based on the concept of [[nanotechnology]], their comical ''[[deus ex machina]]'' activities included such diverse tasks as instant repair and construction, hairstyling, performing a Nanite variation of a [[flea circus]], conducting a microscopic war, and even destroying the Observers' planet after a dangerously vague request from Mike to "take care of [a] little problem". They also ran a [[microbrewery]].
* In the novel "Prey" by Michael Crichton, self replicating nanobots create autonomous nano-swarms with predatory behaviors. The protagonist must stop the swarm before it evolves into a grey goo plague.

'''Moral suasion''' is an appeal to [[morality]] in order to influence or change [[behavior]]. A famous example is the attempt by [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and his [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] to end [[slavery in the United States]] by using moral suasion.&lt;ref&gt;Tunde Adeleke, "Afro-Americans and moral suasion: the debate in the 1830's," The Journal of Negro History, 1998: 127-142.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[economics]], moral suasion is more specifically defined as "the attempt to coerce private economic activity via governmental exhortation in directions not already defined or dictated by existing statute law."&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;  The 'moral' aspect comes from the pressure for 'moral responsibility' to operate in a way that is consistent with furthering the good of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Investopedia, What does moral suasion mean, http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moralsuasion.asp (accessed June 1, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Moral suasion in this narrower sense is also sometimes known as [[jawboning]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Verkuil, "Jawboning administrative agencies: Ex Parte Contracts by the White House," Columbia Law Review, 1980: 943-989.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of moral suasion:
* "Pure" moral suasion is an appeal for [[altruism|altruistic]] behaviour&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;  and is rarely used in economic policy
* "Impure" moral suasion, which is the usual meaning of "moral suasion" in economics, is backed by explicit or implicit threats by authorities in order to provide incentives to comply with the authorities' wishes&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

==Pure moral suasion==

Moral suasion has been applied in many different fields.  In early [[education]]al thought, it was often paired against [[corporal punishment]] as a means of achieving [[school discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Daily Life in America|first=Randall M.|last=Miller|chapter=Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o7bkGF4DytgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA251|page=251|volume=4|isbn=9780313065361}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in [[parenting]], writers from the 19th century through [[Benjamin Spock]] have advocated the use of moral suasion with children as an alternative to physical violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYf8QfXPNWkC&amp;pg=PT30&amp;|page=30|first=Philip J.|last=Greven|year=2010|title=Spare the Rod: The Religious Roots of Punishment and the Psychological Impact of Physical Abuse|chapter=Moral Suasion and Nonviolence|isbn=9780307773005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[politics]], moral suasion has frequently been employed by movements for [[social change]], but its effectiveness has varied widely.

=== Examples ===

==== Temperance movement ====

In the [[temperance movement]] of the 18th and early 19th centuries in Britain and North America, moral suasion was initially a key part of the strategy for reducing the prevalence of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] in society.&lt;ref name="alcohol"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UXHYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA472|page=472|title= Alcohol and Drugs in North America: A Historical Encyclopedia|chapter=Moral Suasion}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the movement began to face the limitations of this strategy in the late 19th century, its members turned to legal coercion, leading to the rise of [[prohibitionism]].&lt;ref name="alcohol"/&gt;

==== United States civil rights movement ====
In the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] of the twentieth century, moral suasion was one of three major prongs of the movement, the others being legal action and collective [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jajYn4iXLBoC&amp;pg=PT72|title=The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture: Volume 24: Race|chapter=Civil Rights, African American|first=Waldo|last=Martin|ref=harv|page=72|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initial victories, this nonviolent strategy began to struggle in the 1960s, and largely ended with the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]].{{sfn|Martin|2013|p=78}}

==== Promoting religious tolerance ====

Moral suasion has sometimes been effective in resolving religious disharmony, especially if the Government is actively involved as a mediator. Moral suasion has been effective in [[Singapore]] in the creation of religious harmony among different religious groups. When conflicts do arise, the Government of Singapore's approach is to mediate or resolve the issue through common sense, and moral suasion using the collective efforts of the community, grassroots and religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Straits Times, "Govt will step in when efforts fail," Straits Times, March 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Protecting the environment ====

Usage of moral suasion in environment regulation consists in making polluters feel responsible for the negative [[externalities]] that they cause.&lt;ref name="zekri"&gt;S. Zekri, "Analyse comparative d'instruments de lutte contre la pollution," in Séminaire de l'Association Tunisienne des Anciens de l'Institut Agronomique Méditerranéen de Zaragoza (Tunis: CIHEAM-IAMZ, 1993), 61-73&lt;/ref&gt; Moral suasion can be very efficient from an economic standpoint since economic agents are free to use any cost-minimising solution deal with their negative externalities instead of having to rely on a government-prescribed regulation or tax.  Furthermore, the administrative costs of using moral suasion to deal with environmental problems is very low.&lt;ref name="zekri"/&gt;

A study of [[marine debris]] regulations in the United States from 1989 to 1993 revealed that moral suasion can be an effective tool to limit the discharge of trash into water in spite the offenders' low probability of being detected.&lt;ref name="coe"/&gt; The evidence on the effectiveness of moral suasion methods to induce environmentally desirable behaviour however is not strong&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;James M. Coe and Donald B. Rogers, Marine Debris, Sources, Impacts, and solutions (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  unless it is coupled with other instruments. For example, Canadian policy makers advocates for moral suasion in their endeavour to achieve environmental and wildlife policy objectives, a course of action likely to fail if little regard is placed on the accompanying incentives.&lt;ref&gt;G.C.van Kooten &amp; Andrew Schmitz, "Preserving Waterfowl Habitat on the Canadian Prairies: Economic Incentives versus Moral Suasion," American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 1992: 79-89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impure moral suasion==
[[File:Ottawa - ON - Bank of Canada.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the Bank of Canada, a [[central bank]]. Central banks often use impure moral suasion to control the [[credit supply]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NjWGbq7JMwC&amp;pg=PA426|page=426|title=Essentials of Macroeconomic Management|edition=1st|isbn=9788125928584|year=|first=M.C.|last=Vaish|publisher=Vikas Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As a policy tool, impure moral suasion differs from direct suasion using laws and regulations in that penalties for non-compliance are not systematically assessed on non-compliers.&lt;ref name="romans"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J.T.|last=Romans|title=Moral Suasion as an Instrument of Economic Policy|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=56|issue=5| date=December 1996 |pages=1220–1226|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led some authors to criticise moral suasion as immoral, since compliers get penalised for cooperating with the stated government agenda (thus incurring extra costs) while non-compliers are not punished.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;  Other objections to the use of moral suasion include the fact that it constitutes extra-legal coercion by the government, that it adds uncertainty to the regulatory process, and that it can undermine or delay the implementation of effective legislation.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

=== Effectiveness ===

Moral suasion will be "an effective economic policy whenever the expected costs of noncompliance is made to exceed the cost of compliance".{{sfn|Romans|1996|p=1223}}

There are 2 necessary conditions for this to happen.
* First, citizens must support the Government's policy,{{sfn|Romans|1996|p=1223}} thus entailing objective congruence between the promoter of moral suasion and the target whose behaviour should be changed. That support emanates from such factors that determine compliance as; potential illegal gain; severity and certainty of sanctions; individual's moral development and their standards of personal morality; individual's perceptions of how just and moral are rules being enforced; and social environmental influences.&lt;ref name="coe"/&gt; For example, during the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe, most business people were accepting foreign currency as a medium of exchange in violation of the country's Exchange Control rules and regulations despite calls by the Central Bank to persuade stakeholders to accept only the local currency as medium of exchange. The business community felt that the rules being enforced through moral suasion were not just and moral. Thus in cases where factors that determine compliance are in line with Government's objectives, the cost of non-compliance increases as behaviours which are contrary to social moral values suffer social reputation if members know about the non compliance.&lt;ref name="coe"/&gt;
* Second, the population of economic agent to be persuaded must be small.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt; Fewness entails the easy identification of economic agents to persuade, and increase the perceived likelihood that non-compliers will be identified and punished.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

Even when those two necessary conditions are not fully met, moral suasion, if only partially effective, can be a valid choice of policy instruments if the alternatives are doing nothing or taking actions with high opportunity or administrative costs.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

Although neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition, a low level of competition amongst suppliers in the economy contributes to increased effectiveness of moral suasion.  Indeed, companies that have been "persuaded" to adopt morally superior but more costly behaviour, will be less competitive and could be driven out of the market by competitors who are not fettered by such constraints if competition is too fierce.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Shleifer, "Does Competition Destroy Ethical Behavior?," The American Economic Review (American Economic Association) 94, no. 2 (May 2004): 414-418&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===

==== Regulating the financial sector ====
The [[Bank of Canada]] defines moral suasion in central banking as "a wide range of possible initiatives by the central bank designed to enlist the co-operation of commercial banks or of other financial organisations in pursuit of some objective of financial policy".&lt;ref name="chant"&gt;John F. Chant &amp; Keith Acheson, "The Choice of Monetary Instruments and the Theory of Bureaucracy," Public Choice Vol. 12 (Spring, 1972), 1972: 13-33&lt;/ref&gt; It could also be defined more generally as "a process whereby commercial banks co-operate with the central bank either for altruistic reasons or out of fear of administrative or legislative sanctions".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Breton and Ronald Wintrobe, "A theory of 'moral' suasion," The Canadian Journal of Economics / Revue canadienne d'Economique, 1978: 210-219&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal moral suasion is characterised by explicit (though non-contractual) commitments to "refrain from activities judged to be in conflict with policies of the central bank".&lt;ref name="chant"/&gt; Informal moral suasion is more difficult to define and is carried though various conversations and interactions between the central bank and the commercial finance institutions, during which commercial institutions can be made to understand the central bank's policy objectives on various matters.

The oligopolistic competition in the British banking sector has witnessed the success of moral suasion as a monetary policy instrument, allowing the central bank to control by persuasion and directive.&lt;ref name="chant"/&gt; Given that only five major banks need to be persuaded in England, a moral suasion policy instrument is very effective because non-compliers can be immediately identified and held up for censure, while in the United States where there are many commercial banks, the Federal Reserve needs to use legalistic controls to pursue the same ends.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

==== Curbing inflation ====

Moral suasion has been effectively used in the management of inflation in a number of countries and is also referred to as "open mouth operations" in the financial sector.&lt;ref&gt;Donald T. Brash, "Inflation targeting 14 years on," Speech to the American Economics Association by the chairman of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (Atlanta, January 5, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The common factor for the success of moral suasion is the trust that stakeholders have on the Central Bank.  For example, New Zealand has experienced high inflation in the early and mid eighties which however drastically reduced as the bank managed to anchor stakeholder inflation expectation through moral suasion. Monetary policy to a great extent is the management of expectations,&lt;ref&gt;Lars E. O. Svensson, http://people.su.se/~leosven/, January 26–27, 2004, (accessed May 28, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; influencing inflation expectations of business and labour. Researchers have found that inflation expectations greatly influence future inflation, hence the use of moral suasion to anchor inflation expectations has been an important instrument in reducing New Zealand's inflation rate.&lt;ref&gt;Editor in Chief Hama Saburi Financial Gazette, "http://www.newzimbabwe.com," http://www.newzimbabwe.com/opinion-2111-Interview+Gono+on+Indigenisation/opinion.aspx, March 26, 2010, (accessed May 28, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral suasion has also been widely and successfully used to curb moderate price increases in countries as Great Britain and Sweden where a principle of "democratic socialism" has been in place for some time.&lt;ref name="madden"&gt;Carl H. Madden, "Government Control versus Market Discipline," Academy of Political Science, 1979: 203-218&lt;/ref&gt; Wage and price increases were agreed upon by the Government, Labour and businesses. The public ownership of the whole exercise enhanced compliance.&lt;ref name="madden"/&gt;

=== In different political regimes ===

Although moral suasion can theoretically be used in any political regime, it has a higher chance of being effective in cases where the political authority is centralised and effective.

Centralisation of authority contributes to the effectiveness of moral suasion as a policy tool since it makes the government's positions clearer and more consistent.  Attempts by governments to influence the behaviour of companies and citizens can therefore be understood more clearly.

Effectiveness of authority refers to the ease in which the intentions of the political executive can be transformed into legislative or regulatory action. This is important because the governments and agencies can use implied threats of price controls, additional regulation or taxation to induce certain behaviours from companies. Such threats will only have credibility if companies think that these threats will be carried out if they do not comply.

As fewness of economic agents to be persuaded is a necessary condition for moral suasion to be effective, this policy instrument is more adapted to countries with higher concentration of suppliers, both in terms of number and of geography  .

Studies suggest that moral suasion is usually not effective in environmental matters in  advanced economies.  It can, however, still be used for developing countries since there are still easy environmental gains that could be made without heavy-handed regulation.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

=== Interaction with other policy instruments ===

Moral suasion is rarely used in isolation.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt; Governments can use moral suasion in conjunction with a variety of other policy instruments to reach its objectives.

==== Regulation ====

Firms may alter their behaviour in order to reduce the probability that they will be subject to additional regulations.  In fact, they may respond more to the threat of being regulated than to the actual imposition of regulations, as illustrated by the fact that US oil companies froze wholesale petrol prices when the 1991 Iraq war started, even without being prompted to do so.&lt;ref name="glazer"&gt;Amihai Glazer and Henry McMillan, "Pricing by the Firm Under Regulatory Threat," ''The Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 1992: 1089-1099&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Price cap ====

Governments can also implicitly or explicitly threaten to establish price caps to make moral suasion more likely to succeed.  This was illustrated in 1979 when the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve System, [[Paul Volcker]], warned banks against raising prime rates above a certain level,&lt;ref name="glazer"/&gt; and in the 1960s when US President John F. Kennedy caused U.S. Steel to reverse its decision to increase prices by sharply criticizing the company.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Vernon and Carmelo Giaccotto, "The impact of indirect government controls on U.S. drug prices and R&amp;D," Cato Journal, 2006: 143-158&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Additional taxation ====

Moral suasion, in the form of public exhortation, was used to curb the bonuses paid to certain employees in the financial sector, without much success.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, "Moral outrage," The Economist, October 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The threat of additional, specific taxes&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, "House Passes Bonus Tax Bill" Wall Street Journal, March 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; was later used in conjunction with moral suasion to make compliance more likely.

==== Open market transactions and other interventions by central banks ====

Central banks and governments who let markets know what they consider ranges of "appropriate" values for its currency has impacts on the trading of the currency, even if intervention never occurs.&lt;ref name="williamson"&gt;John Williamson, "The case for Roughly Stabilizing the Real Value of the Dollar," The American Economic Review, 1989: 41-45&lt;/ref&gt;  Central banks can buy or sell various securities if the currency value falls outside its desired range.

==== Information provision ====

Governments can choose to publish information in order to "shame" certain market participants into altering their behaviour.  The threat of information provision, and of shaming drug companies that were charging "excessive" prices in the eyes of the US government, was used by the Clinton administration to curb increases in drug prices.&lt;ref name="williamson"/&gt;  The government of Singapore's decision to publish comparative cost data from different hospital to encourage them to be more efficient is also an example of where moral suasion was used in conjunction with information provision.&lt;ref&gt;Kai Hong Phua, "Privatization and restructuring of health services in Singapore," IPS occasional paper series (Singapore: Institute of Policy Studies, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Service provision ====

The threat of a [[public option]], i.e. direct government provision of goods and services in a sector that is deemed under-serviced, can be a powerful motivator for private companies to modify their behaviour in order to prevent the government from entering their market.

==== Privatisation and deregulation ====

Large monopolies, sometimes deemed unresponsive to citizens or consumer wishes, can be threatened with privatisation or with deregulation depending on whether the monopoly is government-owned or not.

The concept of a '''mutant''' is a common trope in [[comic books]] and [[science fiction]]. The new [[phenotype]]s that appear in fictional mutations generally go far beyond what is typically seen in biological [[mutant]]s and often result in the mutated life form exhibiting [[superhuman]] abilities or qualities.

==Marvel Comics==
{{main|Mutant (Marvel Comics)}}
In [[Marvel Comics]], genetic mutation has been used as an explanation for super-powers since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/weirdwomanadc.htm|title="Weird Woman" (1950s, Amazing Detective Case)|website=www.marvunapp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/lestrontedjim.htm|title=Ted Lestron (pre-FF mutant)|website=www.marvunapp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/farnsworthvincenttos.htm|title=Vincent Farnsworth (Pre-FF mutant, Tales of Suspense)|website=www.marvunapp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutants have played a major role in Marvel Comics, particularly the [[X-Men]] and related series. In the Marvel Comics universe, they are a heavily persecuted minority where most people fear and hate them. The [[Marvel Universe]] redefines the term to beings who are in a higher stage of evolution known as "[[Homo]] superior" and are not yet accepted by the human race.

===Literature===
* In ''[[The Hunger Games]]'', the mutants bred by the Capitol are called "muttations". They include jabberjays, birds that can copy speech, tracker jackers, a vicious wasp specimen, orange monkeys with claws like switchblades, and wolf mutts, creatures with humanoid faces to mock the previous who died in the 74th Hunger Games. Also, there are mockingjays, hybrids of jabberjays and mockingbirds that can copy songs.
* In ''[[The Chrysalids]]'' by science fiction author [[John Wyndham]], a post-apocalyptic, fundamentalist society views genetic mutation as a blasphemy and the work of the Devil; not realizing it is the result of radiation from a world-wide nuclear war that occurred over a thousand years before. In order to prevent another tribulation, they follow a strict eugenics policy. Individuals considered deviations are either killed or sterilized and banished. The protagonist, a boy named David, can communicate telepathically with a small group of children. However, David and his friends must keep their abnormal abilities secret or risk death or banishment.

===Films===
* In the [[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|remake series of ''The Hills Have Eyes'']], the [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes|Mutants or Hill People]] are humans who have been given misshapen physicalities due to radiation exposure from nuclear weapons testing.
* In ''[[Chernobyl Diaries]]'', the Mutants were the results of humans who were exposed to the radiation leaked during the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. The Ukrainian government has been keeping quiet about the incident and would often dispose of any surviving witnesses by locking them up in a room containing one of the mutants as seen at the end of the movie.
* The Mutants are among the creatures that appear in ''[[The Cabin in the Woods]]''. When it came to the five college students finding the assortment of different items in the basement, one of them contains a gas mask and tonics that if tampered with can summon the Mutants. The Demolitions Department of the Facility bets on them.
* In [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Krrish 3]]'', many mutants were appeared. There mutants was called ''Maanvars'', created by an evil scientist [[Krrish (film series)#Kaal|Kaal]].
* In ''[[Sign Gene]]'', the mutants happen to be deaf and have [[superhuman powers]] through the use of [[sign language]]. The leading character [[Tom Clerc]] is the fourth great grandson of the legendary [[Laurent Clerc]], the father of [[American Sign Language]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advertiser.it/2017072165403/media/film-sign-gene|title=A Settembre nelle sale "Sign Gene" un film diretto e ideato da Emilio Insolera|publisher=|date=21 July 2017|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="father of sign gene"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tokyojournal.com/component/k2/item/743-issue-267-summer-2009-father-of-sign-gene|title=Father of Sign Gene|first=|last=TJ|accessdate=21 March 2017|publisher=''[[Tokyo Journal]]''|date=24 October 2015|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NHK Japanese TV Channel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/heart-net/rounan/backnumber/2009/05/0503.html|title=制作進むろう者の国際共同制作映画　「Sign Gene」｜ろうを生きる難聴を生きる|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Games Machine"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegamesmachine.it/cinema-e-serie-tv/73937/sign-gene-supereroi-sordi/|title=Sign Gene è il nuovo film di supereroi sordi|first=|last=The Games Machine|accessdate=20 August 2017|publisher=''[[The Games Machine]]''|date=27 March 2017|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Print media===
* A December, 1953 article in ''[[Mechanix Illustrated]]'' Magazine called "How Nuclear Radiation Can Change Our Race", warned that in the event of an "Atom War", a mutant species of supermen might arise to assist—or to dominate—humanity. The article was written by "[[Otto Binder|O. O. Binder]]", and opened with a two-page illustration drawn by comic book artist [[Kurt Schaffenberger]], which shows bald, large-craniumed mutants either helping humanity with their superior intellects (in a small section of the picture) or dominating mankind as slavemasters (in the much bigger splash image).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2006/08/15/how-nuclear-radiation-can-change-our-race | title=How Nuclear Radiation Can Change Our Race (Dec, 1953) | date=2006-08-15 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820141758/http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2006/08/15/how-nuclear-radiation-can-change-our-race | archivedate=2006-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Mutant Chronicle'' novels are based on a pen and paper [[role-playing game]] originally published in 1993. It was made into a film (which has very little to do with the novels or the RPG) entitled [[Mutant Chronicles (film)|''Mutant Chronicles'']] in 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4410">'''Marguerite Frances Baird''' (1890— 23 September 1970, also known as Peggy Baird, Peggy Johns, and Peggy Cowley) was an American landscape painter. She was married to poet-playwright [[Orrick Johns]] and writer [[Malcolm Cowley]] and was the lover of playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]] and poet [[Hart Crane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Time of Our Lives |last=Johns |first=Orrick |year=1937 |publisher=Stackpole |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Eugene O'Neill: Beyond Mourning and Tragedy |last=Black |first=Stephen A. |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University press.  |isbn=0-300-09399-3 |pages=201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hart Crane, ''The Letters of Hart Crane, 1916-1932'' (Hermitage House, 1952), page 403&lt;/ref&gt;

Baird was a member of the women's suffrage movement. In 1917, she invited [[Dorothy Day]] to join the [[National Woman's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Catholic Pacifism |last=Klejment |first=Anne |author2=Roberts, Nancy L. |year=1996 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0-275-94784-X |pages=21–22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RAL7LsOGrdkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22American+Catholic+Pacifism%22&amp;num=100&amp;sig=A3sj_6J7y9JyahbdqT8BBSvzhfg#PPA21,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were jailed for 60 days for their protests but were released after 16 days and pardoned by President [[Woodrow Wilson]].[http://www.catholicworker.org/dorothyday/daytext.cfm?TextID=504]

After divorcing her first husband, Johns, she married, in 1919, Malcolm Cowley. In 1931 she moved to Mexico to obtain a divorce. While there her long friendship with poet [[Hart Crane]] turned into Crane's first and only documented heterosexual affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Time and the Literary |last=Newman |first=Karen |author2=Clayton, Jay |author3=Hirsch, Marianne  |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-93960-7 |pages=241 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqO7s2b6RjUC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;dq=%22Peggy+Baird%22+%2Bcowley&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=FEI_CEPV0OFeo4kMW8Bv1gnSXhE }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Broken Tower |last=Mariani |first=Paul |pages=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Crane wrote to a friend about his romance with Peggy Cowley, "Rather amazing things have happened to me since Xmas. Peggy Cowley ... is mainly responsible".&lt;ref&gt;Hart Crane, ''The Letters of Hart Crane, 1916-1932'' (Hermitage House, 1952), page 403&lt;/ref&gt;  This affair has since become a major point of interest for Crane scholars—particularly for those reading him with an eye toward his sexuality—as his engagement with heterosexual life is a determining theme in his last major poem, "[[The Broken Tower]]". Appearing at moments to be a highly symbolic affirmation of their relationship, as well as a denial of his homosexual past (the 'broken tower' can be read as a defeated phallus), the poem was written just months before Crane committed suicide by jumping off the side of a boat in 1932, while on a trip to New York City.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Harold Bloom's introduction to Mark Simon's edition of Crane's poems, published by Liveright (2000), p. xxx.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though their relationship had begun to deteriorate by that time (Crane said he had "misunderstood and misinterpreted Peggy's character quite badly"), Cowley was with Crane on the boat, and she figures briefly, but poignantly, in the events leading up to his death.&lt;ref&gt;See the last chapter in Mariani, as well as articles on "[[The Broken Tower]]" and [[Hart Crane#The 'Homosexual Text'|Hart Crane's sexuality]].&lt;/ref&gt;[http://speccoll.library.kent.edu/literature/poetry/crane.html] Almost thirty years later, she wrote about this period in an article for ''Venture'', "The Last Days of Hart Crane."&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4., No. 1, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;

After Crane's death, Cowley married twice more and converted to Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Marcovic, ''Peggy Baird Cowley: 'Late Have I Loved Thee': Her Wayward Journey from Greenwich Village to Rome'' (St. Matthew Books, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Cowley died of cancer at Dorothy Day's Catholic Worker Farm in Tivoli, New York, where Cowley had resided for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;Paul L. Mariani, ''Broken Tower: A Life of Hart Crane'' (W.W. Norton, 2000), page 427)&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.catholicworker.org/dorothyday/daytext.cfm?TextID=504]

In many countries of the world, there has been a '''phase-out of lightweight plastic bags'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.10.001 |title=Reducing marine pollution from single-use plastics (SUPs): A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=137 |pages=157–171 |year=2018 |last1=Schnurr |first1=Riley E.J. |last2=Alboiu |first2=Vanessa |last3=Chaudhary |first3=Meenakshi |last4=Corbett |first4=Roan A. |last5=Quanz |first5=Meaghan E. |last6=Sankar |first6=Karthikeshwar |last7=Srain |first7=Harveer S. |last8=Thavarajah |first8=Venukasan |last9=Xanthos |first9=Dirk |last10=Walker |first10=Tony R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xanthos"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.02.048 |pmid=28238328 |title=International policies to reduce plastic marine pollution from single-use plastics (plastic bags and microbeads): A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=118 |issue=1–2 |pages=17–26 |year=2017 |last1=Xanthos |first1=Dirk |last2=Walker |first2=Tony R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Single-use [[plastic shopping bag]]s, commonly made from [[low-density polyethylene]] (LDPE) plastic,&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/waste/plastic-bags/index.html|title=Plastic bags|date=5 November 2009|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; have traditionally been given free to customers by [[Retailing|stores]] when purchasing [[Good (economics)|goods]]—a popular method considered a strong, cheap, and [[hygienic]] way of transporting items.

== Issues ==
[[File:Payatas-Dumpsite Manila Philippines02.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Plastic pollution|Plastic waste]] on the mounds of garbage in the [[Philippines]].]]
Plastic bags cause many minor and major ecological and environmental issues. The most general issue with plastic bags is the amount of waste produced. Many plastic bags end up on streets and subsequently pollute major water sources, rivers, and streams.

Even when disposed of properly, they take many years to [[decompose]] and break down, generating large amounts of [[garbage]] over long periods of time. If not disposed of properly the bags can pollute [[waterways]], clog [[Sewerage|sewers]] and have been found in oceans affecting the [[habitat]] of [[animals]] and [[marine creatures]].&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU" /&gt;

Two primary kinds of direct damage to wildlife are entanglement and ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.unep.org/regionalseas/marinelitter/publications/docs/trash_that_kills.pdf|title=Marine litter – trash that kills|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildlife animals or birds can become entangled. When the animals or birds are entangled they drown or cannot fly due to entanglement.&lt;ref name="Plastic Waste and Wildlife"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plasticwastesolutions.com/plastic-litter/#Plastic%20Waste%20and%20Wildlife|title=Plastic Waste and Wildlife|website=Plastic Waste Solutions|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic bags are often [[ingested]] by animals because they cannot distinguish whether it is food or not. As a result, it clogs their intestines which results in death by starvation.&lt;ref name="Plastic Waste and Wildlife"/&gt; Plastic bags can block drains, trap birds and kill livestock. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] has estimated that over 100,000 whales, seals, and turtles die every year{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} as a result of eating or being trapped by plastic bags. In India, an estimated number of 20 cows die per day as a result of ingesting plastic bags and having their digestive systems clogged by the bags. It is also very common across Africa to have sewers and drain systems clogged by bags which cause severe cases of malaria due to the increased population of mosquitoes that live on the flooded sewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.google.de/search?client=opera&amp;q="Getting+Friendly+Environment"+"The+Dell+Challenge"&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8|title=Getting Friendly Environment|publisher=The Dell Challenge|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "white pollution" has been coined in China to describe the local and global effects of discarded plastic bags upon the environment.&lt;ref name=Watts2015&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Watts|first1=Jonathan|title=China's biggest plastic bag maker closes after ban|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/27/china.plasticbags|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 October 2015|date=27 February 2008|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lightweight plastic bags are also blown into trees and other plants and can be mistaken for flowers by animals affecting their diet. Plastic bags break down, but they never biodegrade. As a result, any toxic additives they contain—including flame retardants, antimicrobials, and plasticizers—will be released into the environment. Many of those toxins directly affect the endocrine systems of organisms, which control almost every cell in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiener|first=Robert|title=Plastic Pollution|journal=CQ Global Researcher|date=1 July 2010|pages=157–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research shows the average operating "lifespan" of a plastic bag to be approximately 20 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Plastic bags can last in landfill – an anaerobic environment – for up to 1000 years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The plastic bags that get dumped in the Pacific Ocean would all eventually end up in the [[Great Pacific garbage patch]]. 80% of the plastic waste comes from land while the rest of the 20% comes from oil platforms and ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts|url=http://garbagepatch.net/greatpacificoceangarbagepatchfacts/|website=Garbage Patch – The Great Pacific Garbage Patch and other pollution issues|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This large amount of plastic waste in the Pacific Ocean could be eaten up by marine animals, and this will end up blocking up their breathing passages and digestive systems. Plastic bags not only stay in the Great Pacific garbage patch, they can be washed back up to shore in beaches around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garces|first1=Diego|title=A staggering amount of waste – much of which has only existed for the past 60 years or so – enters the oceans each year.|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/problems/pollution/|website=World Wildlife Fund|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Somalia ====

Plastic bags were banned in the self-declared Republic of Somaliland on 1 March 2005 after a 120-day grace period that the government had given to the public to get rid of their stocks. The Ministry of Trade and Industries announced the cabinet decision in a decree titled: "Banning importation, production and use of plastic bags in the country". The bags had been nicknamed "the Hargeysa flower", as many of them ended up being blown around and getting stuck in trees and shrubs, posing a danger to livestock because the animals that feed on the leaves often ingest the bags accidentally. In 2015 the ban was repeated by Presidential Decree No. #JSL/M/XERM/249-3178/042015, again providing for a 120 days grace period to get rid of stocks. To ensure the implementation of the ban, the government constituted enforcement teams in 2016 to conduct special drives which launch probes into business stalls. At least 1000 men and women in uniform deployed into the main markets and shopping malls. The government announced fines against violators who continue selling plastic bags in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report/53210/somalia-somaliland-bans-use-plastic-bags Somaliland bans use of plastic bags], IRIN News, 1 March 2005.

==== South Africa ====
Plastic bags were a major concern in [[South Africa]] before the bag levy was introduced in 2004. The bags were never banned, but a levy was introduced, payable by the plastic bag manufacturer. The thicker plastic bags are levied and although this move initially caused outrage with consumers and an initial decline in volumes, consumers use has continually increased to several billion plastic shopping bags every year. http://www.econrsa.org/papers/p_papers/pp18.pdf  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/04/080404-plastic-bags.html|title=

==== Bangladesh ====
A strict ban was introduced in Bangladesh in 2002 after floods caused by [[littered]] plastic bags submerged two-thirds of the country in water between 1988 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltvedmonton.com/top+5/6442656206/story.html|title=Top 5 places with plastic bag bans|date=7 June 2012|author=Nicole Bogart|publisher=Global News|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Plastic bags remain a big problem for sewerage system and waterways.

Cambodia passed the legislation to impose a plastic bag tax in October 2017. Supermarkets now are charging customers 400 Riels (10 US cents) per plastic bag should they need one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/cambodia-to-charge-customers-for-plastic-bags-9324502|title=Cambodia to charge customers for plastic bags|work=Channel News Asia|date=19 October 2017|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== China ====
A total plastic bag ban on ultra thin plastic bags and a fee on plastic bags was introduced in [[China]] on 1 June 2008. This came into effect because of the problems with sewerage and general waste. One 2009 survey suggests that plastic bag use fell between 60 and 80% in Chinese supermarkets, and 40 billion fewer bags were used. However, first hand accounts clearly indicate, the ban has seen limited success, and that the use of plastic bags remains prevalent. Street vendors and smaller stores, which make up a significant portion of retail in China, do not abide by the policy in part due to difficulties of enforcing the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/3158| title=China's bag ban, one year later| date=10 July 2009| author=Shi Jierui| publisher=China Dialogue| accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hong Kong ====
[[Hong Kong]] forbids retailers from giving plastic bags under a certain thickness and for free.&lt;ref name="worldbag reduction" /&gt; A 50 cent plastic bag levy was implemented on 1 April 2015 across Hong Kong. The use of plastic bags dropped 90% after the introduction of the levy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/newshour/20110601/107359.shtml| title=Plastic bag ban abroad| date=6 January 2011|publisher=China Network Television|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs show that Hong Kong is phasing out the use of plastic bags at a dramatic rate.

==== India ====
In 2002, [[India]] banned the production of plastic bags below 20&amp;nbsp;µm in thickness to prevent plastic bags from clogging of the municipal drainage systems and to prevent the cows of India ingesting plastic bags as they confuse it for food.&lt;ref name="worldbag reduction" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=plastic pollution: cow eating a plastic bag, near the Ganges River, Allahabad, India, 2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/media/136513/A-cow-eating-a-plastic-bag-discarded-by-Hindu-devotees|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, enforcement remains a problem.

The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has also passed regulation to ban all polythene bags less than 50 microns on 18 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minimum Thickness of Plastic Carry Bags Increased from 40 to 50 Microns|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=138144|publisher=Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to poor implementation of this regulation, regional authorities(states and municipal corporations), have had to implement their own regulation.

In 2003, [[Denmark]] introduced a tax on retailers giving out plastic bags. This encouraged stores to charge for plastic bags and pushed the use of reusable bags. It was thought that this saved about 66% of plastic and paper bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.reuseit.com/learn-more/top-facts/trends-from-around-the-world| title=Learn About Global Efforts to Reduce Waste from Disposable Products| publisher=Reuse it| accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a similar law was passed by the ''Inatsisartut ''in Greenland, which applied a recycling tax on plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ina.gl/demokratihome/publikationer.aspx?docgallery=10554&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014 Denmark had the lowest plastic bag use in Europe, with 4 bags per person per year, compared to 466 in Portugal, Poland and Slovakia.&lt;ref name="ABC 2014"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/environment/articles/2014/04/17/3987712.htm "Europe votes to slash plastic bag use"], ABC News, 17 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Germany ====
Germany imposes a fee on excess packaging through its [[Green Dot (symbol)|Green Dot]] program, which included plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.howtogermany.com/pages/recycling.html|title=How To Germany – All About Recycling in Germany|website=www.howtogermany.com|access-date=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, all stores in [[Germany]] that provide plastic bags must pay a recycling tax.&lt;ref name="bigfatbags.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bigfatbags.co.uk/bans-taxes-charges-plastic-bags/|title=List by country; 'bag charges, taxes and bans'. – Big Fat Bags|newspaper=Big Fat Bags|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement was signed between trade representatives and the [[Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety]] in April 2016 to reduce plastic bags, excepting thin bags for fruit and vegetables, bags for deep-freeze products and long-term usable bags,&lt;ref name="umweltbundesamt-2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/themen/ende-der-kostenlosen-plastiktueten-fragen-antworten|title=Ende der kostenlosen Plastiktüten – Fragen und Antworten|publisher=Umweltbundesamt|date=2016-06-02|accessdate=2017-08-31|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in many shops no longer offer such plastic bags free of cost since July 2016.

==== Portugal ====

Portugal has implemented a plastic bag tax amounting to 10 cents (€) on single-use carrier bags, which led to a reduction of 90% in their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/plastic-bag-use-plummets-a-year-after-tax-introduction/37473|title=Plastic bag use plummets a year after tax introduction|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many retailers started selling thicker (reusable) plastic bags, which are not subject to the tax, for the same amount.

A law was introduced in 2006 (law 578/2006) - and was later modified in 2011 (law 1032/2011) – that puts a mandatory tax on non-biodegradable plastic bags. The modification in 2011 reduced the tax on plastic bags and was regarded by some as a step backwards from environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://legestart.ro/ecotaxa-pe-pungi-si-sacose-pentru-cumparaturi| title=Ecotaxa pe pungi şi sacoşe pentru cumpărături| date=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Environmental movement in Switzerland|Waste management in Switzerland}}

In 2016, the two largest chains of supermarkets in Switzerland, the [[Federation of Migros Cooperatives]] and [[Coop (Switzerland)|Coop]], announced that they will progressively stop to distribute free plastic bags (at the check-out).&lt;ref name=Guillaume&gt;{{fr}} Michel Guillaume, "L'économie suisse promet de verdir", ''[[Le temps]]'', Monday 26 September 2016, page 4.

[[Migros]] previously tested the measure in the [[Canton of Vaud]] since 2013: they reduced the number of plastic bags distributed by ninety percent (and saved 100,000 [[Swiss francs|francs]] per year).&lt;ref name=Guillaume/&gt;&lt;ref name=West&gt;{{fr}} Michael West, "Environnement. « Petits prix pour grands effets »", ''Migros magazine'', number 39, 29 September 2016, page 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Migros will be the first to introduce the measure across the country, on 1 November 2016 (the bags will be made with recycled plastic and cost 0.05 [[Swiss francs]] each).&lt;ref name=Guillaume/&gt;&lt;ref name=West/&gt; [[Coop (Switzerland)|Coop]] plans to introduce this in 2017.&lt;ref name=RTS&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.rts.ch/info/economie/8036213-chez-coop-et-migros-les-sacs-jetables-vont-desormais-couter-5-centimes.html "Chez Coop et Migros, les sacs jetables vont désormais coûter 5 centimes"], [[Radio télévision suisse]], 22 September 2016 (page visited on 25 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Climate Change Act 2008]] served as the legislative framework for the regulation of plastic bags in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Everett|first=Michael|last2=Priestley|first2=Sara|title=The 5p Plastic Bag Charge|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7241#fullreport|date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Wales=====
Wales introduced a legal minimum charge of 5 pence for almost all single use bags in October 2011. Paper and biodegradable bags are included in the charge as well as plastic bags, with only a few specific exemptions – such as for unpackaged food or medicine supplied on an [[NHS Wales|NHS]] prescription.
[[Value added tax|VAT]] raised from the charge is collected by the government. Retailers are asked to pass the rest of the proceeds on to charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retailers|url=http://www.carrierbagchargewales.gov.uk/retailers/?lang=en|work=Carrier bag charge Wales|publisher=Crown|accessdate=4 August 2013|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; July 2012 statistics released by the Welsh Government suggested that carrier bag use in Wales had reduced 96% since the introduction of the charge.&lt;ref name="bigfatbags.co.uk"/&gt;

=====Northern Ireland=====
[[Northern Ireland]] introduced a 5 pence levy on almost all single use bags on 8 April 2013. The levy will be extended to reusable carrier bags with a retail price of less than 20 pence from 19 January 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NI Direct Bag Levy|url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/baglevy|website=Carrier bag Levy Northern Ireland|publisher=NI Direct|date=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as data from a number of retailers indicate that reusable bag sales have increased by 800% since the introduction of the levy on single use bags.
The proceeds of the levy (£4.17m in 2013/14) are paid to the Department of the Environment
and used to fund local environmental projects and enforce the levy.
Official statistics for the Northern Ireland levy show that the number of single use bags dispensed fell from around 300 million in 2012/13 to 84.5 million in 2013/14 – a reduction of 72%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NI Bag Levy Annual Statistics 2013/14|url=http://www.doeni.gov.uk/carrier_bag_levy_-_annual_statistics_2013-14.pdf|website=Carrier bag Levy Northern Ireland Statistics|publisher=DOE NI|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the rest of the UK, the English charge does not apply to paper bags or bags made from other natural materials.

*{{Smallsup|2}} Although the state of Hawaii does not ban plastic bags, all of its local jurisdictions do, effectively banning them statewide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizens Group Pushes City Council to Repeal Disposable Shopping Bag Fee|url=http://fighttheplasticbagban.com/2014/10/23/citizens-group-pushes-city-council-to-repeal-disposable-shopping-bag-fee/#more-2535|accessdate=22 November 2014|date=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2018, the City of Austin announced that it would end enforcement of its bag ban. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Austin to end its bag ban after Texas Supreme Court ruling|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2018/07/03/report-austin-end-its-bag-ban-after-texas-supreme-court-ruling/|accessdate=9 August 2018|date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Phase-out of lightweight plastic bags in Australia}}
Although the nation does not ban lightweight bags, the states of [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], and the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] and [[Northern Territory]], along with some cities have independently banned the bag.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[Coles Bay, Tasmania]] was the first location in Australia to ban the bag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2003-04-29-tasmania-carries-ecofight-bans-plastic-bags| title=Tasmania carries eco-fight, bans plastic bags| date=29 April 2003| publisher= Mail &amp; Guardian| accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the "Zero Waste" program in South Australia led to its lightweight bag ban in October 2008. It is estimated that 400 million bags are saved each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerowaste.sa.gov.au/plastic|title=Plastic Bag Ban|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Zero Waste South Australia|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western Australia and Queensland banned them on 1 July 2018 and Victoria has announced it will introduce a ban in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/costs/new-laws-and-changes-that-will-affect-australia-from-january-1-2018-and-beyond/news-story/85825f4092834190a292a828aacb7c3d|title=New laws that will affect Australia|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-06/plastic-bags-banned-in-queensland-cash-for-cans-and-bottles/8876620|title=Plastic bag ban gets green light in Queensland|date=6 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/victoria-set-to-ban-plastic-bags-next-year|title=Victoria set to ban plastic bags next year|publisher=|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Argentina ====

In 2012, the [[Buenos Aires]] [[Buenos Aires City Legislature|city government]] allowed [[supermarkets]] to charge for plastic bags in order to discourage their use, which is said to have reduced their use by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El gobierno porteño anunció que desde 2017 se prohibirán bolsas plásticas en los súper|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201609/161475-bolsas-plasticas-supermercados-ciudad-gobierno-porteno.html|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the city announced a full ban on the distribution of plastic bags in supermarkets and hypermarkets, commencing 1 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adiós a un clásico: desde 2017, no habrá más bolsas de plástico en los súper porteños|url=http://www.clarin.com/ciudades/Adios-clasico-bolsas-plastico-portenos_0_1643235849.html|website=Clarin|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polémica por la prohibición de bolsas en los comercios porteños|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1934273-polemica-por-la-prohibicion-de-bolsas-en-los-comercios-portenos|website=La Nacion|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Uruguay ====
Legislation banning non-biodegradable bags and applying a charge to biodegradable bags has been passed by the government of Uruguay but is yet to enter into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/politica/senado-aprobo-ley-bolsas-plasticas-trata.html|title=Senado aprobó la ley sobre el uso de bolsas plásticas, ¿de qué se trata?|first=|last=ElPais|publisher=|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Different methods of phase-out ==
Two of the most popular methods of phasing out lightweight plastic bags have been outlined above, including both fees and bans. The fee strategy is said to have all of the same results in plastic bag reduction as a plastic bag ban, with the additional benefit of creating a new revenue source.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lisa |last1=Skumatz |first2=Dana |last2=D'Souza |date=November 2016 |title=Bag ban basics |journal=Plastics Recycling Update |volume=35 |issue=11 |pages=16–19 |url=https://resource-recycling.com/plastics/2016/12/08/bag-ban-basics/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plastic bag fee method also protects consumer choice, which the ban does not.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Recycling of plastic bags can be another method of phase-out. However, a big issue with recycling is that only 5% of plastic bags make it to recycling facilities to begin with.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Even when bags are brought to these recycling bins and facilities, they often fly out of these bins or recycling trucks and end up as litter on the streets.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Momentum for Plastic Bag Bans Spreading; Recycling Programs Earn Mixed Reviews |journal=Solid Waste Report |volume=45 |issue=8 |date=April 25, 2014 |pages=5–6 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/95763387/momentum-plastic-bag-bans-spreading-recycling-programs-earn-mixed-reviews }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue with recycling is that different bags are made from different yet aesthetically similar types of plastics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bags can be either made of bioplastics or biodegradable plastics, and if accidentally combined in a compost, the bioplastics could contaminate the biodegradable composting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These bags can also jam recycling equipment when mixed with other types of plastic, which can be costly to repair.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Costs of repairs rounded out to be about $1 million per year in San Jose, California.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Individuals can also engage in advocacy local officials and local merchants. With the rise in eco-tourism &lt;ref&gt;https://travel.usnews.com/features/why-ecotourism-is-booming&lt;/ref&gt; and green travel, there are many opportunities to say no to plastic &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://theluckystraw.com/blogs/news/9-popular-languages-say-no-thank-you-to-single-use-plastics | title=Say "No to Plastic" in 9 Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Brooks|first1=Andrew|title=Phylosymbiosis: Relationships and Functional Effects of Microbial Communities across Host Evolutionary History|journal=PLOS Biology|date=November 18, 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000225.g004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, a phylosymbiotic signal among a group of species is evident if their microbiome similarity [[dendrogram]] could significantly
recapitulate their hosts phylogenic tree. For the analysis of the phylosymbiotic signal to be reliable, environmental differences
that could shape the host microbiome should be either eliminated or accounted for.
One plausible mechanistic explanation for such phenomena could be, for example, a result of host immune genes that rapidly evolve in a continues [[arms race]] with members of its microbiome.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5127">In electronic systems, '''power supply rejection ratio''' ('''PSRR'''), also '''supply-voltage rejection ratio'''&lt;ref&gt;http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tl071.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ('''''k''&lt;sub&gt;SVR&lt;/sub&gt;'''; '''SVR'''), is a term widely used to describe the capability of an electronic circuit to suppress any power supply variations to its output signal.

In the specifications of [[operational amplifier]]s, the PSRR is defined as the ratio of the change in supply voltage to the equivalent (differential) output voltage it produces,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maximintegrated.com/glossary/definitions.mvp/term/PSRR/gpk/240 Maxim Integrated's glossary definition of PSRR]&lt;/ref&gt; often expressed in [[decibel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Phillip; Holberg, Douglas, ''CMOS Analog Circuit Design'', Oxford University Press, Inc, cc 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franco, ''Design With Operational Amplifiers and Analog Integrated Circuits'', McGraw-Hill, Inc, cc 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Walt; ''Op Amp Applications Handbook'', Newnes, 2006, page 86 http://www.analog.com/library/analogdialogue/archives/39-05/Web_Ch1_final_R.pdf#page=93&lt;/ref&gt; An ideal op-amp would have infinite PSRR. The output voltage will depend on the feedback circuit, as is the case of regular input offset voltages. But testing is not confined to [[direct current|DC]] (zero frequency); often an operational amplifier will also have its PSRR given at various frequencies (in which case the ratio is one of [[RMS amplitude]]s of [[sinewave]]s present at a power supply compared with the output, with gain taken into account). Unwanted [[oscillation]], including [[motorboating (electronics)|motorboating]], can occur when an amplifying stage is too sensitive to signals fed via the power supply from a later [[power amplifier]] stage.

Some manufacturers specify PSRR in terms of the offset voltage it causes at the amplifiers inputs; others specify it in terms of the output; there is no industry standard for this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tutorials/MT-043.pdf Op Amp Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR) and Supply Voltages]. Analog Devices appnote/tutorial MT-043&lt;/ref&gt; The following formula assumes it is specified in terms of output:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{PSRR} [\text{dB}] = 10 \log_{10} \left(\frac{\Delta V_\text{supply}^2 A_v^2}{{\Delta V_\text{out}^2}}\right)\text{dB}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage gain.

For example: an amplifier with a PSRR of 100&amp;nbsp;dB in a circuit to give 40&amp;nbsp;dB closed-loop [[gain (electronics)|gain]] would allow about 1&amp;nbsp;[[millivolt]] of power supply ripple to be superimposed on the output for every 1&amp;nbsp;[[volt]] of ripple in the supply. This is because
: &lt;math&gt;100\ \text{dB} - 40\ \text{dB} = 60\ \text{dB}&lt;/math&gt;.

And since that's 60&amp;nbsp;dB of rejection, the sign is negative so:
: &lt;math&gt;1\ \text{V} \cdot 10^\frac{-60}{20} = 0.001\ \text{V} = 1\ \text{mV}&lt;/math&gt;

Note:
* The PSRR doesn't necessarily have the same poles as A(s), the open-loop gain of the op-amp, but generally tends to also worsen with increasing frequency (e.g. http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/opa2277.pdf).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wallindustries.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/appnotes.pdf Techniques for Output Ripple/Noise Measurement].&lt;/ref&gt;
* For amplifiers with both positive and negative power supplies (with respect to earth, as [[op-amp]]s often have), the PSRR for each supply voltage may be separately specified (sometimes written: PSRR+ and PSRR−), but normally the PSRR is tested with opposite polarity signals applied to both supply rails at the same time (otherwise the [[common-mode rejection ratio]] (CMRR) will affect the measurement of the PSRR).
* For voltage regulators the PSRR is occasionally quoted (confusingly; to refer to ''output'' voltage change ratios), but often the concept is transferred to other terms relating changes in output voltage to input: Ripple rejection (RR) for low frequencies, line transient response for high frequencies, and line regulation for DC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24402">[[Image:Preference example.jpg|thumb|alt=Example of a preference relation|A simple example of a preference order over three goods]] In [[economics]] and other [[social science]]s, '''preference''' is the ordering of alternatives based on their relative [[utility]], a process which results in an optimal "[[choice]]" (whether real or theoretical). The character of the individual preferences is determined purely by taste factors, independent of considerations of prices, income, or availability of goods.

With the help of the [[scientific method]] many practical decisions of life can be modelled, resulting in testable predictions about human behavior. Although economists are usually not interested in the underlying causes of the preferences in themselves, they are interested in the theory of choice because it serves as a background for empirical [[demand]] analysis.&lt;ref name="Arrow, Kenneth 1958"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arrow |first=Kenneth |year=1958 |title=Utilities, attitudes, choices: a review note |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=1–23 |jstor=1907381 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1926 [[Ragnar Frisch]] developed for the first time a mathematical model of preferences in the context of economic demand and utility functions.&lt;ref name="Barten 1982 p. 384"&gt;[[Anton Barten|Barten, Anton]] and Volker Böhm. (1982). "Consumer theory", in: Kenneth Arrow and Michael Intrilligator (eds.) ''Handbook of mathematical economics. Vol. II'', p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; Up to then, economists had developed an elaborated theory of demand that omitted ''primitive characteristics'' of people. This omission ceased when, at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, [[logical positivism]] predicated the need of theoretical concepts to be related with observables.&lt;ref name="econ.hit-u.ac.jp"&gt;Gilboa, Itzhak. (2009). [http://www.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/~kmkj/uncertainty/Gilboa_Lecture_Notes.pdf ''Theory of Decision under uncertainty'']. Cambridge: Cambridge university press&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas economists in the 18th and 19th centuries felt comfortable theorizing about utility, with the advent of logical positivism in the 20th century, they felt that it needed more of an empirical structure. Because [[binary relation|binary choices]] are directly observable, it instantly appealed to economists. The search for observables in microeconomics is taken even further by [[revealed preference|revealed preference theory]].

Since the pioneer efforts of Frisch in the 1920s, one of the major issues which has pervaded the theory of preferences is the representability of a preference structure with a real-valued function. This has been achieved by mapping it to the mathematical index called ''utility''. [[John von Neumann|Von Neumann]] and Morgenstern 1944 book "Games and Economic Behaviour" treated preferences as a formal relation whose properties can be stated axiomatically.  These type of axiomatic handling of preferences soon began to influence other economists: Marschak adopted it by 1950, Houthakker employed it in a 1950 paper, and Kenneth Arrow perfected it in his 1951 book "Social Choice and Individual Values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://128.118.178.162/eps/mhet/papers/0506/0506003.pdf |author=Moscati, Ivan |year=2004 |title=Early Experiments in Consumer Demand Theory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302122147/http://128.118.178.162/eps/mhet/papers/0506/0506003.pdf |archive-date=2014-03-02 |website=128.118.178.162 |others=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gérard Debreu]], influenced by the ideas of the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki group]], championed the axiomatization of consumer theory in the 1950s, and the tools he borrowed from the mathematical field of binary relations have become mainstream since then. Even though the economics of choice can be examined either at the level of utility functions or at the level of preferences, to move from one to the other can be useful. For example, shifting the conceptual basis from an abstract preference relation to an abstract utility scale results in a new mathematical framework, allowing new kinds of conditions on the structure of preference to be formulated and investigated.

Another historical turnpoint can be traced back to 1895, when [[Georg Cantor]] proved in a theorem that if a binary relation is ''linearly ordered'', then it is also isomorphically embeddable in the ordered real numbers. This notion would become very influential for the theory of preferences in economics: by the 1940s prominent authors such as [[Paul Samuelson]], would theorize about people actually having weakly ordered preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Fishburn, Peter (1994). "Utility and subjective probability", in: Robert Aumann and Sergiu Hart (eds). ''Handbook of game theory. Vol. 2''. Amsterdam: Elsevier Science. pp. 1397–1435.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notation ==
Suppose the set of all states of the world is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and an agent has a preference relation on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. It is common to mark the weak preference relation by &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;x \preceq y&lt;/math&gt; means "the agent wants y at least as much as x" or "the agent weakly prefers y to x".

The symbol &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is used as a shorthand to the indifference relation: &lt;math&gt;x\sim y \iff (x\preceq y \land y\preceq x)&lt;/math&gt;, which reads "the agent is indifferent between y and x".

The symbol &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; is used as a shorthand to the strong preference relation: &lt;math&gt;x\prec y \iff (x\preceq y \land  y\not\preceq x)&lt;/math&gt;, which reads "the agent strictly prefers y to x".

== Meaning in decision sciences ==
In everyday speech, the statement "''x'' is preferred to ''y''" is generally understood to mean that someone chooses ''x'' over ''y''. However, decision theory rests on more precise definitions of preferences given that there are many experimental conditions influencing people's choices in many directions.

Suppose a person is confronted with a mental experiment that she must solve with the aid of introspection.  She is offered apples (''x'') and oranges (''y''), and is asked to verbally choose one of the two.  A decision scientist observing this single event would be inclined to say that whichever is chosen is the preferred alternative.

Under several repetitions of this experiment (and assuming laboratory conditions controlling outside factors), if the scientist observes that apples are chosen 51% of the time it would mean that &lt;math&gt;x\succ y&lt;/math&gt;.  If half of the time oranges are chosen, then &lt;math&gt;x\sim y&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, if 51% of the time she chooses oranges it means that &lt;math&gt;y\succ x&lt;/math&gt;.  Preference is here being identified with a greater frequency of choice.

This experiment implicitly assumes that the trichotomy property holds for the order relation. Otherwise, out of 100 repetitions, some of them will give as a result that neither apples, oranges or ties are chosen.  These few cases of uncertainty will ruin any preference information resulting from the frequency attributes of the other valid cases.

However, this example was used for only illustrative purposes, and it should not be interpreted as an indication that the economic theory of preferences starts with experiments and moves on to theorems.  On the contrary, the method used in the theory preferences is essentially an armchair method. Economists make assumptions, and from these assumptions they deduce theorems which presumably can be tested, even though the test is not indispensable.

Consumers are by definition demanders of goods and services.  Standard economic theory states that their demand behaviour  can be thought of maximizing a utility index, or its parallel: the ranking of the set of possible consumption bundles by means of either the binary relation "at least as good as" or the relation "strictly preferred as".

Of all the available bundles of goods and services, only one is ultimately chosen. The theory of preferences examines the problem of getting to this optimal choice using a ''system of preferences'' within a budgetary limitation.

In reality, people do not necessarily rank or order their preferences in a consistent way. In preference theory, some idealized conditions are regularly imposed on the preferences of economic actors. One of the most important of these idealized conditions is the ''axiom of transitivity'':&lt;ref name="Arrow, Kenneth 1958"/&gt;

'''Axiom of transitivity''': If alternative &lt;math&gt;A\!&lt;/math&gt; is weakly preferred to alternative &lt;math&gt;B\!&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B\!&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;C\!&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A\!&lt;/math&gt; is weakly preferred to &lt;math&gt;C\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Symbolically, this can be stated as

:If &lt;math&gt;A \succeq B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \succeq C,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A \succeq C.&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes a weaker axiom (that is, it is implied by transitivity, but not vice versa), called "quasi-transitivity" is used, which only requires the above for strict preferences:

:If &lt;math&gt;A \succ B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \succ C,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A \succ C.&lt;/math&gt;

The language of binary relations allow one to write down exactly what is meant by "ranked set of preferences", and thus gives an unambiguous definition of ''order''. A preference relation should not be confused with the order relation &lt;math&gt; \geqslant \!&lt;/math&gt; used to indicate which of two real numbers is greater.&lt;ref&gt;Binmore, Ken. (1992). ''Fun and games. A text on game theory''. Lexington: Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt; Order relations over the real number line satisfy an extra condition:

:&lt;math&gt;A \geqslant B \!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \geqslant A \!&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;A = B .&lt;/math&gt;

But in preference relations, two things can be equally liked without being in some sense numerically equal.  Hence, an ''indifference relation'' is used instead of an equality relation (the symbol &lt;math&gt; \sim \!&lt;/math&gt; denotes this kind of relation). Thus we have

:&lt;math&gt;A \succeq B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \succeq A&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;A \sim B.&lt;/math&gt;

A system of preferences or ''preference structure'' refers to the set of qualitative relations between different alternatives of consumption. For example, if the alternatives are:

*Apple
*Orange
*Banana

In this example, a preference structure would be:

"The apple is at least as preferred as the orange", and "The orange is as least as preferred as the Banana". One can use &lt;math&gt;\succsim\!&lt;/math&gt; to symbolize that some alternative is "at least as preferred as" another one, which is just a binary relation on the set of alternatives. Therefore:

* Apple &lt;math&gt;\succsim\!&lt;/math&gt; Orange
* Orange &lt;math&gt;\succsim\!&lt;/math&gt; Banana

The former qualitative relation can be preserved when mapped into a numerical structure, if we impose certain desirable properties over the binary relation: these are the ''axioms of preference order''. For instance: Let us take the apple and assign it the arbitrary number 5. Then take the orange and let us assign it a value lower than 5, since the orange is less preferred than the apple. If this procedure is extended to the banana, one may prove by induction that if &lt;math&gt;u\!&lt;/math&gt; is defined on {apple, orange} and it represents a well-defined binary relation called "at least as preferred as" on this set, then it can be extended to a function &lt;math&gt;u\!&lt;/math&gt; defined on {apple, orange, banana} and it will represent "at least as preferred as" on this larger set.

Example:

*Apple = 5
*Orange = 3
*Banana = 2

5 &gt; 3 &gt; 2 = u(apple) &gt; u(orange) &gt; u(banana)

and this is consistent with Apple &lt;math&gt;\succsim\!&lt;/math&gt; Orange, and with Orange &lt;math&gt;\succsim\!&lt;/math&gt; Banana.

'''Axiom of order ([[total relation|Completeness]])''': For all &lt;math&gt;A\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\!&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;A\! \succsim\!  B\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B\! \succsim\!  A\!&lt;/math&gt; or both.

In order for preference theory to be useful mathematically, we need to assume the '''axiom of continuity'''. Continuity simply means that there are no ‘jumps’ in people’s preferences. In mathematical terms, if we prefer point A along a preference curve to point B, points very close to A will also be preferred to B. This allows preference curves to be differentiated. The continuity assumption is "stronger than needed" in the sense that it indeed guarantees the existence of a ''continuous utility function'' representation. Continuity is, therefore, a sufficient condition, but not a necessary one, for a system of preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.policonomics.com/preferences/ |title= Policonomics.  Economics made simple|last1= Gallego|first1= Lope|last2= |first2= |year= 2012|work= Preferences |publisher= Open Dictionary|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although commodity bundles come in discrete packages, economists treat their units as a continuum, because very little is gained from recognizing their discrete nature. According to Silberberg,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} the two approaches are reconcilable by this rhetorical device: When a consumer makes repeated purchases of a product, the commodity spaces can get converted from the discrete items to the time rates of consumption.  Instead of, say, noting that a consumer purchased one loaf of bread on Monday, another on Friday and another the following Tuesday, we can speak of an average rate of consumption of bread equal to 7/4 loaves per week. There is no reason why the average consumption per week cannot be any real number, thus allowing differentiability of the consumer's utility function. We can speak of continuous ''services of goods'', even if the goods themselves are purchased in discrete units.

Although some authors include [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]] as one of the axioms required to obtain representability (this axiom states that &lt;math&gt;A\! \succsim\!  A\!&lt;/math&gt;), it is redundant inasmuch as the completeness axiom implies it already.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreu Mas-Colell|Mas-Colell, Andreu]], Michael Whinston and Jerry Green (1995). ''Microeconomic theory''. Oxford: Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-507340-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Most commonly used axioms ===

* Order-theoretic: acyclicity, transitivity, the semiorder property, completeness
* Topological: continuity, openness or closedness of the preference sets
* Linear-space: [[convex preferences|convexity]], homogeneity, translation-invariance
{{clarify|date=May 2015}}

=== Normative interpretations of the axioms ===
Everyday experience suggests that people at least talk about their preferences as if they had personal "standards of judgment" capable of being applied to the particular domain of alternatives that present themselves from time to time.&lt;ref name="Shapley 1974"&gt;Shapley, Lloyd and Martin Shubik. (1974). "Game theory in economics". RAND Report R-904/4&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the axioms are an attempt to model the decision maker's preferences, not over the actual choice, but over the type of desirable procedure (a procedure that any human being would like to follow). [[Behavioral economics]] investigates inconsistent behavior (i.e. behavior that violates the axioms) of people. Believing in axioms in a normative way does not imply that everyone is asserted to behave according to them. Instead, they are a basis for suggesting a mode of behavior, one that people would like to see themselves or others following.&lt;ref name="econ.hit-u.ac.jp"/&gt;

Here is an illustrative example of the normative implications of the theory of preferences:&lt;ref name="econ.hit-u.ac.jp"/&gt; Consider a decision maker who needs to make a choice. Assume that this is a choice of where to live or whom to marry and that the decision maker has asked an economist for advice. The economist, who wants to engage in normative science, attempts to tell the decision maker how she should make decisions.

Economist: I suggest that you attach a utility index to each alternative, and choose the alternative with the highest utility.

Decision Maker: You've been brainwashed. You think only in terms of functions. But this is an important decision, there are people involved, emotions, these are not functions!

Economist: Would you feel comfortable with cycling among three possible options? Preferring ''x'' to ''y'', and then ''y'' to ''z'', but then again ''z'' to ''x''?

Decision Maker: No, this is very silly and counterproductive. I told you that there are people involved, and I do not want to play with their feelings.

Economist: Good. So now let me tell you a secret: if you follow these two conditions making decision, and avoid cycling, then you can be described as if you are maximizing a utility function.

Consumers whose preference structures violate transitivity would get exposed to being exploited by some unscrupulous person. For instance, Maria prefers apples to oranges, oranges to bananas, and bananas to apples. Let her be endowed with an apple, which she can trade in a market. Because she prefers bananas to apples, she is willing to pay, say, one cent to trade her apple for a banana.  Afterwards, Maria is willing to pay another cent to trade her banana for an orange, and again the orange for an apple, and so on. There are [[Intransitivity#Occurrences in preferences|other examples]] of this kind of irrational behaviour.

Completeness implies that some choice will be made, an assertion that is more philosophically questionable.  In most applications, the set of consumption alternatives is infinite and the consumer is not conscious of all preferences. For example, one does not have to choose over going on holiday by plane or by train: if one does not have enough money to go on holiday anyway then it is not necessary to attach a preference order to those alternatives (although it can be nice to dream about what one would do if one would win the lottery). However, preference can be interpreted as a hypothetical choice that could be made rather than a conscious state of mind.  In this case, completeness amounts to an assumption that the consumers can always make up their mind whether they are indifferent or prefer one option when presented with any pair of options.

Under some extreme circumstances there is no "rational" choice available. For instance, if asked to choose which one of one's children will be killed, as in [[Sophie's Choice (novel)|Sophie's Choice]], there is no rational way out of it. In that case preferences would be incomplete, since "not being able to choose" is not the same as "being indifferent".

The ''indifference relation'' ~ is an [[equivalence relation]].  Thus we have a [[quotient set]] S/~ of [[equivalence class]]es of S, which forms a [[partition of a set|partition]] of S.  Each equivalence class is a set of packages that is equally preferred.
If there are only two commodities, the equivalence classes can be graphically represented as [[indifference curve]]s.
Based on the preference relation on S we have a preference relation on S/~.  As opposed to the former, the latter is [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] and a [[total order]].

== Applications to theories of utility ==
In economics, a utility function is often used to represent a preference structure such that &lt;math&gt;u\left(A\right)\geqslant u(B)&lt;/math&gt; [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;A \succsim\! B&lt;/math&gt;. The idea is to associate each class of indifference with a real number such that, if one class is preferred to the other, then the number of the first one is greater than that of the second one. When a preference order is both transitive and complete, then it is standard practice to call it a ''rational preference relation'', and the people who comply with it are ''[[rational agent]]s''. A transitive and complete relation is called a [[Strict weak ordering#Total preorders|''weak order'' (or ''total preorder'')]]. The literature on preferences is far from being standardized regarding  terms such as ''complete'', ''partial'', ''strong'', and ''weak''. Together with the terms "total", "linear", "strong complete", "quasi-orders", "pre-orders" and "sub-orders", which also have a different meaning depending on the author's taste, there has been an abuse of semantics in the literature.&lt;ref name="Shapley 1974"/&gt;

According to Simon Board, a [[Continuous function|continuous]] utility function always exists if &lt;math&gt; \succsim\! &lt;/math&gt; is a continuous rational preference relation on &lt;math&gt;R^n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Boa2005&gt;{{cite web|last=Board|first=Simon|title=Preferences and Utility|url=http://www.econ.ucla.edu/sboard/teaching/econ11_09/econ11_09_lecture2.pdf|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For any such preference relation, there are many continuous utility functions that represent it.  Conversely, every utility function can be used to construct a unique preference relation.

All the above is independent of the prices of the goods and services and of the budget constraints faced by consumers. These determine the ''feasible'' bundles (which they can afford). According to the standard theory, consumers chooses a bundle within their budget such that no other feasible bundle is preferred over it; therefore their utility is maximized.

=== Primitive equivalents of some known properties of utility functions ===
* An increasing utility function is associated with a [[monotonic]] preference relation.
* [[Quasi-convex function|Quasi-concave]] utility functions are associated with a [[convex preferences|convex preference]] order. When non-convex preferences arise, the [[Shapley–Folkman lemma]] is applicable.
* Weakly separable utility functions are associated with the weak separability of preferences.{{clarify|date=May 2015}}

=== Lexicographic preferences ===
[[Lexicographic preferences]] are a special case of preferences that assign an infinite value to a good, when compared with the other goods of a bundle.

== Strict versus weak ==
The possibility of defining a strict preference relation &lt;math&gt;\succ\! &lt;/math&gt; as distinguished from the weaker one &lt;math&gt;\succsim\!&lt;/math&gt;, and vice versa, suggests in principle an alternative approach of starting with the strict relation &lt;math&gt;\succ\! &lt;/math&gt; as the primitive concept and deriving the weaker one and the indifference relation. However, an indifference relation derived this way will generally not be transitive.&lt;ref name="Barten 1982 p. 384"/&gt; According to Kreps "beginning with strict preference makes it easier to discuss noncomparability possibilities".&lt;ref name="Kreps 1990 p. 24"&gt;Kreps, David. (1990). ''A Course in Microeconomic Theory''.  New Jersey: Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aggregation ==
Under certain assumptions, individual preferences can be aggregated onto the preferences of a group of people. However, [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that voting systems sometimes cannot convert individual preferences into desirable community-wide acts of choice.

== Expected utility theory ==
Preference relations were initially applied only to alternatives that involve no risk and uncertainties because this is an assumption of the [[homo economicus]] model of behaviour.  Nonetheless, a very similar theory of preferences has also been applied to the space of simple lotteries, as in [[expected utility hypothesis|expected utility theory]].  In this case a preference structure over lotteries can also be represented by a utility function.

== Criticism ==
Some critics say that rational theories of choice and preference theories rely too heavily on the assumption of invariance, which states that the relation of preference should not depend on the description of the options or on the method of elicitation.  But without this assumption, one's preferences cannot be represented as maximization of utility.&lt;ref&gt;Slovic, P. (1995). "The Construction of Preference". American Psychologist, Vol. 50, No. 5, pp. 364–371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Milton Friedman said that segregating taste factors from objective factors (i.e. prices, income, availability of goods) is conflicting because both are "inextricably interwoven".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13340">{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}'''Psychological projection''' is a theory in [[psychology]] in which the human ego defends itself against unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by [[denying]] their existence in themselves while [[Attribution (psychology)|attributing]] them to others.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person who is habitually rude may constantly accuse other people of being rude. It incorporates [[blame]] shifting. 

==Historical precursors==
A prominent precursor in the formulation of the projection principle was [[Giambattista Vico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Van A.|title=Feuerbach and the interpretation of religion|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521470498|pages=4|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Feuerbach_and_the_Interpretation_of_Reli.html?id=KdsKpZ6eJWMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cotrupi|first=Caterina Nella|title=Northrop Frye and the poetics of process|year=2000|publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division|isbn=978-0802081414|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1841, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] was the first [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] thinker to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Van A.|title=Feuerbach and the interpretation of religion|year=1997|publisher=University of cambridge|isbn= 978-0521586306|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackey|first=James patrick|title=The Critique of Theological Reason|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University press|isbn=978-0521169233|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=John K.|title=A Field Statement on the Anthropology of Religion|journal=Ejournalofpoliticalscience|year=1990|url=http://ejournalofpoliticalscience.org/anthrel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Babylonian Talmud]] (500 AD) notes the human tendency toward projection and warns against it: "Do not taunt your neighbour with the bleach you yourself drank."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Babylonian Talmud|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Baba Metsiya 59b; Kiddushin 70a.|quote="And he who [continually] declares [others] unfit is [himself] unfit  and never speaks in praise [of people]. And Samuel said: All who defame others, with their own blemish they stigmatize [these others]."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytic developments==
Projection ({{lang-de|Projektion}}) was conceptualised by [[Sigmund Freud]] in his letters to [[Wilhelm Fliess]],&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (London 2005) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and further refined by [[Karl Abraham]] and [[Anna Freud]]. Freud considered that, in projection, thoughts, motivations, desires, and feelings that cannot be accepted as one's own are dealt with by being placed in the outside world and attributed to someone else.&lt;ref&gt;''Case Studies II'' p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; What the ego repudiates is [[splitting (psychology)|split off]] and placed in another.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud would later come to believe that projection did not take place arbitrarily, but rather seized on and [[exaggerated]] an element that already existed on a small scale in the other person.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) pp.&amp;nbsp;200–01.&lt;/ref&gt; (The related defence of [[projective identification]] differs from projection in that there the other person is expected to become identified with the [[Impulse (psychology)|impulse]] or desire projected outside,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1997) p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; so that the self maintains a connection with what is projected, in contrast to the total repudiation of projection proper.)&lt;ref&gt;Otto F. Kernberg, ''Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism'' (London 1990) p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melanie Klein]] saw the projection of good parts of the self as leading potentially to over-[[Idealisation and devaluation|idealisation]] of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Klein'' (1979) p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, it may be one's conscience that is projected, in an attempt to escape its control: a more benign version of this allows one to come to terms with outside authority.&lt;ref&gt;R. Wollheim, ''On the Emotions'' (1999) pp.&amp;nbsp;217–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical examples ==

Projection tends to come to the fore in normal people at times of personal or political crisis&lt;ref&gt;Erik Erikson, ''Childhood and Society'' (1973) p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; but is more commonly found in the neurotic or [[psychotic]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'', p. 281n.&lt;/ref&gt; in personalities functioning at a primitive level as in [[narcissistic personality disorder]] or [[borderline personality disorder]].&lt;ref name =Gabbard2010&gt;Glen O. Gabbard, ''Long-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy'' (London 2010) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]] considered that the unacceptable parts of the personality represented by the [[Shadow (psychology)|Shadow]] archetype were particularly likely to give rise to projection, both small-scale and on a national/international basis.&lt;ref name="micro and macro projection"&gt;Carl G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) pp.&amp;nbsp;181–82.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie-Louise Von Franz]] extended her view of projection, stating that "wherever known reality stops, where we touch the unknown, there we project an [[archetype|archetypal]] image".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Patterns of Creativity Mirrored in Creation Myths (Seminar series) |publisher=Spring Publications |first=Marie-Louise von |last=Franz |year=September 1972 |isbn=978-0-88214-106-0}} ''found in'': {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=F23WJ8altDUC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=wherever+known+reality+stops,+where+we+touch+the+unknown,+there+we+project+an+archetypal+image |title=Archetypal explorations: an integrative approach to human behavior |publisher=Routledge |last=Gray |first=Richard M. |year=1996 |page=201 |isbn=978-0-415-12117-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological projection is one of the [[medical explanations of bewitchment]] used to explain the behavior of the afflicted children at [[Salem witch trials|Salem]] in 1692. The historian [[John Demos]] asserts that the symptoms of bewitchment experienced by the afflicted girls were due to the girls undergoing psychological projection of repressed aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Demos |title=Underlying Themes in the Witchcraft of Seventeenth-Century New England |journal=[[American Historical Review]] |volume=75 |issue=5 |year=1970 |pages=1311–26 [p. 1322] |jstor=1844480 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical examples ==

*'''[[Victim blaming]]:''' The victim of someone else's actions or bad luck may be offered criticism, the theory being that the victim may be at fault for having attracted the other person's hostility.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pursuit of Health'', June Bingham &amp; Norman Tamarkin, M.D., Walker Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Projection of marital guilt:''' Thoughts of [[infidelity]] to a partner may be [[unconscious mind|unconsciously]] projected in self-defence on to the partner in question, so that the [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] attached to the thoughts can be repudiated or turned to [[blame]] instead, in a process linked to [[denial]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (Middlesex 1987) p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Bullying]]:''' A bully may project his/her own feelings of [[vulnerability]] onto the target(s) of the bullying activity. Despite the fact that a bully's typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully's targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully's own sense of personal [[Emotional security|insecurity]] and/or vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gilbert, ''Overcoming Depression'' (1999) pp.&amp;nbsp;185–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of [[interpersonal relationships]], all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict.&lt;ref name="micro and macro projection"/&gt;
*'''Projection of general guilt:''' Projection of a severe conscience&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; is another form of defense, one which may be linked to the making of [[false accusations]], personal or political.&lt;ref name="micro and macro projection"/&gt;
*'''Projection of hope:''' Also, in a more positive light, a patient may sometimes project his or her feelings of [[hope]] onto the therapist.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Counter-projection ==

Jung wrote, "All projections provoke counter-projection when the object is unconscious of the quality projected upon it by the subject."&lt;ref&gt;''General Aspects of Dream Psychology,'' CW 8, par. 519.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, what is unconscious in the recipient will be projected back onto the projector, precipitating a form of mutual [[acting out]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann Casement, ''Carl Gustav Jung'' (2001) p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a rather different usage, [[Harry Stack Sullivan]] saw counter-projection in the therapeutic context as a way of warding off the [[compulsive behavior|compulsive]] re-enactment of a [[psychological trauma]], by emphasizing the difference between the current situation and the projected [[fixation (psychology)|obsession]] with the perceived perpetrator of the original trauma.&lt;ref&gt;F. S. Anderson ed., ''Bodies in Treatment'' (2007) p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical approaches ==

Drawing on [[Gordon Allport]]'s idea of the expression of self onto activities and objects, projective techniques have been devised to aid personality assessment, including the [[Rorschach test|Rorschach]] ink-blots and the [[Thematic Apperception Test]] (TAT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=B. |last=Semeonoff |chapter=Projective Techniques |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Gregory |title=The Oxford Companion to the Mind |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1987 |page=646 |isbn=0-19-866124-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Projection may help a fragile [[id, ego, and super-ego|ego]] reduce [[anxiety]], but at the cost of a certain [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], as in [[dissociative identity disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/408692 Trauma and Projection] {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases, an individual's personality may end up becoming critically depleted.&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006) pp. 115, 126.&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, therapy may be required which would include the slow rebuilding of the personality through the "taking back" of such projections.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Jacoby, ''The Analytic Encounter'' (1984) pp. 10, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Some studies were critical of Freud's theory. Research supports the existence of a [[false-consensus effect]] whereby humans have a broad tendency to believe that others are similar to themselves, and thus "project" their personal traits onto others. This applies to good traits as well as bad traits and is not a defense mechanism for denying the existence of the trait within the self.&lt;ref name="Empirical Findings"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baumeister |first=Roy F. |last2=Dale |first2=Karen |last3=Sommer |first3=Kristin L. |title=Freudian Defense Mechanisms and Empirical Findings in Modern Social Psychology: Reaction Formation, Projection, Displacement, Undoing, Isolation, Sublimation, and Denial |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=66 |issue=6 |year=1998 |pages=1090–92 |doi=10.1111/1467-6494.00043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Newman, Duff, and Baumeister (1997) proposed a new model of defensive projection. In this view, [[Psychological repression|repressors]] try to [[Thought suppression|suppress thoughts]] of their undesirable traits, and these efforts make those trait categories highly accessible—so that they are then used all the more often when forming impressions of others. The projection is then only a by-product of the real defensive mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A new look at defensive projection: Thought suppression, accessibility, and biased person perception |last=Newman |first=Leonard S. |last2=Duff |first2=Kimberley J. |last3=Baumeister |first3=Roy F. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=72 |issue=5 |year=1997 |pages=980–1001 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.5.980 |pmid=9150580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15494">[[File:Pillory 9105377.jpg|thumb|[[Pillory|Pillories]] were a common form of punishment.]]

'''Public humiliation''' or '''public shaming''' is a form of [[punishment]] whose main feature is [[Dishonor|dishonoring]] or disgracing a person, usually an offender or a [[prisoner]], especially in a public place. It was regularly used as a form of judicially sanctioned punishment in previous centuries, and is still practiced by different means in the modern era.

In the United States, it was a common punishment from the beginning of [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] through the 19th century.  It fell out of common use in the 20th century, though it has seen a revival starting in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-04-12/news/0004120235_1_unusual-punishment-humiliation-sentencing&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shameful exposure ==
[[File:Edmondaviv2014.jpg|thumb|A man (Edmond Aviv) sits down in punishment, sentenced by judge, holding up a sign that says he was a [[Bullying|bully]] for bullying children with disabilities.]]


Public humiliation exists in many forms. Most often a criminal was placed in the center of town and having the local populace enact a form of "[[mob justice]]" on the individual. [[File:Flute of Shame Torture Museum Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|Flute of Shame displayed at the [[Torture museum|Torture Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]].]]

The punishment of public humiliation could be, amongst other things, an offender being forced to relate his crime, such as by exaggerated physical parody: a 'shame [[flute]]' for a bad musician or wearing a giant [[rosary]] ({{lang-nl|schandstenen}}, "stones of shame") for someone late to church. The offender could alternatively be sentenced to remain exposed in a specific public place, in a restraining device.

In the [[Netherlands|Low Countries]], the {{lang|nl|schandstoel}} ("Chair of shame"), the {{lang|nl|kaak}} or {{lang|nl|schandpaal}} ("pole of shame", a simple type of [[pillory]]), the {{lang|nl|draaikooi}} were customary for [[Adultery|adulteresses]], and the {{lang|nl|schopstoel}}, a [[scaffold]]ing from which one is kicked off to land in [[mud]] and dirt.

In the more extreme cases being subjected to [[verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[physical abuse]] from the crowd, which could have serious consequences especially when the hands are not free to protect himself. Some sentences actually prescribe additional humiliation, such as shaving, or combine it with painful corporal punishments, see below.&lt;ref name="williamsburg"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm | title=Bilboes, Brands, and Branks: Colonial Crimes and Punishments | author=Cox, James | journal=Colonial Williamsburg Journal |date=Spring 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Colonial America]], common forms of public humiliation were the [[stocks]] and [[pillory]], imported from [[Europe]]. Nearly every sizable town had such instruments of public humiliation, usually at the town square. Historic public humiliation displays can still be seen in the historic [[Virginia]] town of [[Colonial Williamsburg]].[[File:Man and woman undergoing public exposure for adultery in Japan-J. M. W. Silver.jpg|thumb|Man and woman undergoing public exposure for adultery in Japan, around 1860.]]In pre–World War Japan, [[adulterer]]s were publicly exposed purely to shame them.

In post-Colonial times, judicial use of public humiliation punishment has largely fallen out of favor since the practice is now considered [[cruel and unusual punishment]], which is outlawed in the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="ziel"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.law2.byu.edu/jpl/papers/v19n2_Paul_Ziel.pdf | title=Eighteenth Century Public Humiliation Penalties in Twenty-First Century America: The 'Shameful' Return of 'Scarlet Letter' Punishments in ''U.S. v.

In [[Thailand|Siam]], an adulteress was paraded with a [[hibiscus]] behind the ear. Thieves were tattooed on their faces. Other criminals were paraded with a device made of woven cane on the forehead, or lengths of bamboo hung around the neck. Errant Brahmans had to wear a string of oversize beads.

Just like painful forms of corporal punishment, it has parallels in educational and other rather private punishments (but with some audience), in school or domestic disciplinary context, and as a [[rite of passage]]. Physical forms include being forced to wear some sign such as "donkey ears" (simulated in paper, as a sign one is—or at least behaved—proverbially stupid), wearing a [[dunce cap]], having to stand, kneel or bend over in a corner, or repeatedly write something on a blackboard ("I will not spread rumors", for example). Here different levels of physical discomfort can be added, such as having to hold heavy objects, go barefoot (see below) or kneel on an uneven surface. Like physical punishment and harsh hazing, these have become controversial in most modern societies, in many cases leading to legal restrictions and/or (sometimes voluntary) abolishment.[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-041-10, Paris, der Kollaboration beschuldigte Französinnen.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|Paris 1944: French women accused of collaboration with Nazis had their heads shaved and were paraded through the streets barefoot.]]Having the [[Head shaving|head shaved]] can be a humiliating punishment prescribed in law,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wluml.org/node/3908 ''"Article 87 ... shall be sentenced to flogging, having his head shaven, and one year of exile..."''], The Islamic Penal Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran&lt;/ref&gt; but also something done as "mob justice" - a stark example of which was the thousands of European women who had their heads shaved in front of cheering crowds in the wake of World War II,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Antony Beevor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/05/women-victims-d-day-landings-second-world-war |title="An Ugly Carnival" |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Shorn Women: Gender and Punishment in Liberation France", {{ISBN|978-1-85973-584-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as punishment for associating with occupying [[Nazism|Nazis]] during the war.[[File:Slave dance to banjo, 1780s.jpg|thumb|Modern era slaves typically had to go barefoot by regulation in slave codes (colonial United States, 1780s).]]Forcing people to go [[barefoot#Imprisonment and slavery|barefoot]] has been used as a relatively effortless and more subtle form of humiliation in most past and present civilized cultures, primarily using the visual contrast to the standard form of appearance while also creating some level of physical discomfort.

It usually also causes a considerable degree of humiliation, as this noticeable detail typically sets the prisoner apart from spectators visually and demonstrates the person's vulnerability and general powerlessness.

Further means of public humiliation and degradation consist in forcing people to wear typifying clothes, which can be penitential garbs or [[prison uniform]]s.

Presenting arrestees or prisoners to the public in restraints (such as [[handcuffs]], [[legcuffs|shackles]] or similar devices) also serves as a convenient{{how|date=September 2017}} method of public humiliation besides the primary security aspects. The effect is complemented by presenting the person in a prison uniform or similar clothing.{{example needed}}

== Corporal punishment ==
[[File:Antoin Sevruguin 12 Falak Whipping the soles of a criminal.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Public [[foot whipping]] in Iran]]
[[File:Supplice du Grand Knout.jpg|thumb|Public [[flagellation]] in Russia, 18th century.]]
[[File:Pelourinho.jpg|thumb|Public flogging in Brazil, [[Jean-Baptiste Debret]]]]
Apart from specific methods essentially aiming at humiliation, several methods combine pain and humiliation or even death and humiliation. In some cases, pain or at least discomfort is insignificant or rather secondary to the humiliation.

=== Public punishment ===
The simplest is to administer painful [[corporal punishment]] in public - the major aim may be [[deterrence (psychological)|deterrence]] of potential offenders - so the public will witness the perpetrator's fear and agony. This can either take place in a [[town square]] or other public gathering location such as a school, or take the form of a procession through the streets. This was not uncommon in the sentences to ''Staupenschlag'' (whipping or [[birching]], generally on the bare [[buttocks]]) in various [[German language|German-speaking]] states, till the 19th century. A naval equivalent was [[Cat o' nine tails#Flogging round the fleet|Flogging round the fleet]] on a raft taken from ship to ship for consecutive installments of a great total of lashes, that could even be lethal. In some countries the punishment of [[foot whipping]] is executed in public to this day.

*The humiliation as well as degradation is generally intensified if the perpetrator is unclothed (partially or entirely) as the exposure leaves the person feeling vulnerable and helpless. A common and simple form of humiliating exposure consists in taking away a person's shoes and keeping him or her [[barefoot]] during corporal punishment or generally.
*Further means of intensifying the public humiliation and degradation especially during punishment consist in forcing people to wear typifying clothes, which can be [[prison uniform]]s or in former times penitential garbs or rags, further incremented in combination with an exposure aspect such as bare feet.
*Even when not strictly public, humiliation can still be a psychologically "painful" aspect of punishment because of the presence of witnessing peers (such as fellow prisoners), staff or other onlookers, or simply because the person administering the punishment is witnessing the reactions of the culprit. The loss of self-control in the presence of bystanders further increments the humiliating effect of the punishment significantly. This is also true for punishments in class and similar situations.
*[[Crucifixion]] was used by the Romans to add public humiliation to a [[death penalty]]. [[Josephus]] describes how the Roman soldiers would crucify people naked, and using different tortuous positions as a way to further humiliate them. Crucified bodies were left to decay on the cross for weeks, and crows would come to feed on the corpses; this can be seen as post-mortem public humiliation. See also [[gibbeting]].
&lt;!--*{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}Public shaving was also applied to (true or alleged) collaborators after the [[Allies of World War II|Allied liberated]] occupied territories from the [[Storm Troopers|Nazi troops]]; being thus marked, they would remain in danger from [[molestation]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}--&gt;

=== Torture marks ===
[[File:Philip Dawe (attributed), The Bostonians Paying the Excise-man, or Tarring and Feathering (1774) - 02.jpg|thumb|The 1774 [[tarring and feathering]] of British customs agent [[John Malcolm (Loyalist)|John Malcolm]] soon after the [[Boston Tea Party]] ]]

The humiliation can be extended; intentionally or not; by leaving visible marks, such as [[scar]]s, notably on body parts that are normally left visible. This also serves as a virtually indelible criminal record. This can even be the main intention of the punishment, as in the case of [[scarification]]s, such as [[branding persons|branding]]. It invariably is essential in forms of mutilation, such as [[cropping (punishment)|ear cropping]], though the functional loss is even greater; pain may even be intentionally minimized as in the case of surgical amputation, eliminating the risk of accidental death. [[Tarring and feathering]] also serves as means of extended humiliation.

== Psychological effects ==
{{main|Humiliation#Psychological effects}}
Public shaming can result in negative psychological effects and devastating consequences, regardless of the punishment being justifiable or not. It could cause depression, suicidal thoughts and other severe mental problems. The humiliated individuals may develop a variety of symptoms including apathy, paranoia, anxiety, PTSD, etc. The rage and fury may arise in the persecuted individual, themselves lashing out against innocent victims, as they seek revenge or as a means of release.

{{Close Relationships}}
'''Relational transgressions''' occur when people violate implicit or explicit [[Interpersonal relationship|relational]] [[Norm (sociology)|rules]].  These transgressions include a wide variety of behaviors.  

Scholars tend to delineate relational transgressions into three categories or approaches.  

The first approach focuses on the aspect of certain behaviors as a violation of relational [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] and rules. 

The second approach focuses on the interpretive consequences of certain behaviors, particularly the degree to which they hurt the victim, imply disregard for the victim, and imply disregard for the relationship.

The third and final approach focuses more specifically on [[behaviors]] that constitute [[infidelity]] (a common form of relational transgression).&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"&gt;Metts and Cupach, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundaries of relational transgressions are permeable.  [[Betrayal]] for example, is often used as a synonym for a relational transgression.  In some instances, betrayal can be defined as a rule violation that is traumatic to a relationship, and in other instances as destructive conflict or reference to infidelity.  Common forms of relational transgressions include the following:  having sex with someone else, wanting to or actually dating others, deceiving one's partner about something significant, [[flirting]] with or kissing someone else, keeping secrets from your partner, becoming emotionally involved with someone else, and betraying the partner's confidence.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual and operational definitions==

===Rule violations===
Rule violations are events, actions, and behaviors that violate an implicit or explicit relationship norm or rule.  Explicit [[Norm (sociology)|rules]] tend to be relationship specific, such as those prompted by the bad habits of a partner (e.g., excessive drinking or drug abuse), or those that emerge from attempts to manage conflict (e.g., rules that prohibit spending time with a former spouse or talking about a former girlfriend or boyfriend). Implicit rules tend to be those that are accepted as cultural standards for proper relationship conduct (e.g., [[monogamy]] and secrets kept private).  The focus on relational transgressions as rule violations presents an opportunity to examine a wide range of behaviors across a variety of relationship types.  This method facilitates analysis of transgressions from a rules perspective.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  In a study of college students' relational transgressions, the following nine categories emerged consistently.&lt;ref&gt;Metts and Cupach, 2007, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

# Inappropriate interaction: Instances in which a partner performs badly during an interaction, typically a conflict episode.
# Lack of sensitivity: Instances in which a partner exhibits thoughtless, disrespectful, or inconsiderate behavior.  Offender demonstrates a lack of concern or emotional responsiveness when expected and appropriate.
# Extrarelational involvement: Sexual or emotional involvement with persons other than the offended party.  Offender does not confound involvement with deception.
# Relational threat confounded by deception:  Instances in which a partner participates in sexual or emotional involvement with persons other than the offended party and then uses deception to conceal the involvement.
# Disregard for primary relationship: Actions that indicate the transgressor does not privilege the primary relationship; chooses other people or activities over partner or changes plans.
# Abrupt termination: Actions that terminate a relationship with no warning and no explanation.
# Broken promises and rule violations:  Occasions during which a partner fails to keep a promise, changes plans with no warning or explanation, or violates a rule that the offended person assumes was binding.
# Deception, secrets and privacy: Instances in which a partner lied, kept important information a secret, failed to keep sensitive information private, or violated privacy boundaries.
# [[Abuse]]: Verbal or physical threats.
 
Cameron, Ross, and Holmes (2002) identified 10 categories of common relational negative behavior that constitute relational transgressions as rule violations:&lt;ref name="Cameron, Ross, and Holmes, 2002"&gt;Cameron, Ross, and Holmes, 2002, p.310&lt;/ref&gt;
# Broken promises
# Overreaction to the victim's behavior
# Inconsiderate behavior
# Violating the victim's desired level of intimacy
# Neglecting the victim
# Threat of infidelity
# Infidelity
# Verbal aggression toward the victim
# Unwarranted disagreement
# Violent behavior toward the victim

===Infidelity===
{{Main|Infidelity}}
Infidelity is widely recognized as one of the most hurtful relational transgressions.  Around 30% to 40% of dating relationships are marked by at least one incident of sexual infidelity.&lt;ref name="Cameron, Ross, and Holmes, 2002"/&gt; It is typically among the most difficult transgressions to forgive.  There are typically four methods of discovery:   
# Finding out from a third party. 
# Witnessing the infidelity firsthand, such as  walking in on your partner with someone else. 
# Having the partner admit to infidelity after another partner questions. 
# Having the partner tell their partner on their own.
Partners who found out through a third party or by witnessing the infidelity firsthand were the least likely to forgive.  Partners who confessed on their own were the most likely to be forgiven.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Sexual vs. emotional infidelity====
[[Infidelity|Sexual infidelity]] refers to sexual activity with someone other than a person's partner.  Sexual infidelity can span a wide range of behavior and thoughts, including: sexual intercourse, heavy petting, passionate kissing, sexual fantasies, and sexual attraction.  It can involve a sustained relationship, a one-night stand, or a prostitute.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  Most people in the United States openly disapprove of sexual infidelity, but research indicates that infidelity is common.  Men are typically more likely than women to engage in a sexual affair, regardless if they are married or in a dating relationship.

[[Emotional affair|Emotional infidelity]] refers to emotional involvement with another person, which leads one's partner to channel emotional resources to someone else. Emotional infidelity can involve strong feelings of love and intimacy, nonsexual fantasies of falling in love, romantic attraction, or the desire to spend time with another individual.  Emotional infidelity may involve a coworker, Internet partner, face-to-face communication, or a long distance phone call.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  Emotional infidelity is likely related to dissatisfaction with the communication and social support an individual is receiving in his or her current relationship.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

Each type of infidelity evokes different responses. Sexual infidelity is more likely to result in  hostile, shocked, repulsed, humiliated, homicidal, or suicidal feelings. Emotional infidelity is more likely to evoke feelings of being undesirable, insecure, depressed, or abandoned. When both types of infidelity are present in a relationship, couples are more likely to break up than when only one type of infidelity is involved.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;

====Gender differences in infidelity====
While [[gender]] is not a reliable predictor of how any individual will react to sexual and [[Emotional affair|emotional infidelity]], there are nonetheless differences in how men and women on average react to sexual and [[Emotional affair|emotional infidelity]].  [[Western world|Culturally Western]] men, relative to culturally Western women, find it more difficult to forgive a partner's sexual infidelity than a partner's emotional infidelity. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}   Western men are also more likely to break up in response to a partner's [[Infidelity|sexual infidelity]] than in response to a partner's emotional infidelity. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Conversely, Western women on average find it more difficult to forgive a partner's emotional infidelity than a partner's sexual infidelity, and are more likely to end a relationship in response to a partner's emotional infidelity. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  A possible explanation for these differences has been proposed by [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]]: over human evolution, a partner's sexual infidelity placed men, but not women, at risk of investing resources in a rival's offspring.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Therefore, a partner's sexual infidelity represents a potentially more costly adaptive problem for men than women.  As such, modern men have psychological mechanisms that are acutely sensitive to a partner's sexual infidelity.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  

Whereas on average Western men are more acutely sensitive to sexual infidelity (supposedly driven by evolutionary requirements noted above), Western women are commonly believed to have greater sensitivity to emotional infidelity.  This response in women is, by the arguments of the theory above, driven by the perception that emotional infidelity suggests a long-term diversion of a partner's commitment, and a potential loss of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Shackelford, Buss, and Bennett, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Evolutionary psychology explains this difference by arguing that a woman's loss of male support would result in a diminished chance of survival for both the woman and her offspring.  Consequently, relationship factors that are more associated with commitment and partner investment play a more critical role in the psyche of women in contrast to men.&lt;ref name="Cann and Baucom, 2004"&gt;Cann and Baucom, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

When infidelity involves a former romantic partner, as opposed to a new partner, it is perceived to be more distressing – especially for women.  Both men and women overall view situations of sexual infidelity as more distressing than situations of emotional involvement.  The typical man, however, viewed only the former partner scenario as more distressing with regard to sexual infidelity; men made no distinction for emotional infidelity.  Women, however, view a former partner scenario as the most distressing option for both sexual and emotional infidelity.&lt;ref name="Cann and Baucom, 2004"/&gt; Men and women both judge infidels of the opposite gender as acting more intentionally than their own gender.&lt;ref&gt;Mongeau, Hale, and Alles, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internet infidelity====
Recent research provides support for conceptualizing infidelity on a continuum ranging in severity from superficial/informal behavior to involving or goal-directed behavior.  This perspective accounts for the varying degrees of behavior (e.g., sexual, emotional) on the Internet.  A number of acts not involving direct, one-to-one communication with another person (e.g. posting a personal ad or looking at pornography) can be perceived as forms of infidelity.  Thus, communication with another live person is not necessary for infidelity to occur.   Accordingly, Internet infidelity is defined by Docan-Morgan and Docan (2007) as follows: "An act or actions engaged via the internet by one person with a committed relationship, where such an act occurs outside the primary relationship, and constitutes a breach of trust and/or violation of agreed-upon [[norm (sociology)|norms]] (overt or covert) by one or both individuals in that relationship with regard to relational exclusivity, and is perceived as having a particular degree of severity by one or both partners."&lt;ref&gt;Docan-Morgan and Docan, 2007, p.331&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jealousy===
{{Main|Jealousy}}

====Characteristics of jealousy====
Jealousy is the result of a relational transgression, such as a partner having a sexual or emotional affair.  Jealousy can also be seen as a transgression in its own right, when a partner's suspicions are unfounded.  Thus, jealousy is an important component of relational transgressions.  There are several types of jealousy.  Romantic jealousy occurs when a partner is concerned that a potential rival might interfere with his or her existing romantic relationship.  Sexual jealousy is a specific form of romantic jealousy where an individual worries that a rival is having or wants to have sex with his or her partner.  

Other forms of jealousy include:
*'''Friend jealousy''' – feeling threatened by a partner's relationships with friends.
*'''Family jealousy''' – feeling threatened by a partner's relationships with family members.
*'''Activity jealousy''' – perceiving that a partner's activities, such as work, hobbies, or school, are interfering with one's relationship.
*'''Power jealousy''' – perceiving that one's influence over a partner is being lost to others.
*'''Intimacy jealousy''' – believing that one's partner in engaging in more intimate communication, such as disclosure and advice seeking, with someone else.

Jealousy is different from [[envy]] and rivalry.  Envy occurs when people want something valuable that someone else has.  Rivalry occurs when two people are competing for something that neither person has.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Experiencing romantic jealousy====
Individuals who are experiencing jealous thoughts typically make primary and secondary cognitive appraisals about their particular situation.  Primary appraisals involve general evaluations about the existence and quality of a rival relationship.  Secondary appraisals involve more specific evaluations about the jealous situation, including possible causes of the jealousy and potential outcomes to the situation.  There are four common types of secondary appraisals:  
# Jealous people assess motives. 
# Jealous people compare themselves to their rival. 
# They evaluate their potential alternatives. 
# Finally, jealous people assess their potential loss.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

Jealous individuals make appraisals to develop coping strategies and assess potential outcomes.

Jealous individuals normally experience combinations of emotions, in addition to the aforementioned cognitive appraisals.  The most common emotions associated with jealousy are fear and anger; people are fearful of losing their relationship and they are often angry at their partner or rival.  Other common negative emotions associated with jealousy are sadness, guilt, hurt, and envy.  Sometimes, however, jealousy leads to positive emotions, including increased passion, love, and appreciation. 

Relational partners sometimes intentionally induce jealousy in their relationship.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  There are typically two types of goals for jealousy induction.  Relational rewards reflect the desire to improve the relationship, increase self-esteem, and increase relational rewards.  The second type of goal, relational revenge, reflects the desire to punish one's partner, the need for revenge, and the desire to control one's partner.  The tactic of inducing jealousy may produce unintended consequences, as jealousy often leads to other relational transgressions including violence.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischmann, Spitzberg, Andersen, and Roesch, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Communicative responses to jealousy====
Jealousy can involve a wide range of communicative responses.  These responses are based upon the individuals' goals and emotions.  The most common of these responses are negative affect expression, [[Integrative communication theory|integrative communication]], and distributive communication.  When people want to maintain their relationship, they use integrative communication and compensatory restoration.  People who are fearful of losing their relationships typically use compensatory restoration.  

Conversely, people who are concerned with maintaining their self-esteem allege that they deny jealous feelings.  When individuals are motivated to [[Uncertainty Reduction Theory|reduce uncertainty]] about their partner, they use integrative communication, surveillance, and rival contacts to seek additional information.  Communicative responses to jealousy may help reduce uncertainty and restore self-esteem, but they may actually increase uncertainty and negatively impact relationships and self-esteem in some instances. The type of communicative response used is critical.  

For example, avoidance/denial may be used to protect one's self-esteem, but it may also result in increased uncertainty and relational dissatisfaction, if the jealous partner is left with lingering suspicions.  Similarly, compensatory restoration may improve the relationship in some instances, but it may also communicate low self-esteem and desperation by the jealous individual.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, Jorgensen, Spitzberg, and Eloy, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  Distributive communication, which includes behaviors such as yelling and confrontation, may serve to vent negative emotion and retaliate by making the partner feel bad.  This may exacerbate an already negative situation and make reconciliation less likely.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman and Guerrero, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jealousy and relational satisfaction====
Jealousy is generally considered to be a relationship dysfunction, though it may have some positive relational properties.  These positive properties can be attained through development of one's ability to manage jealousy in a productive way, so that the jealous individual shows care and concern without seeming overly fearful, aggressive, or possessive.  Negative affect expression can be effective if used in conjunction with integrative communication.  Compensatory restoration can be effective, but when used in excess, too much can make an individual seem desperate and too eager to please, which can have detrimental effects on the relationships.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Rumination====
{{Main|Rumination (psychology)}}
From the aspect of jealousy, rumination reflects uncomfortable mulling about the security of a relationship.  Rumination refers to thoughts that are conscious, recurring, and not demanded by the individual's current environment.  Ruminative thoughts occur repetitively and are difficult to eliminate.  In the context of relational threats, rumination can be described as obsessive worry about the security of the current relationship.  Individuals who ruminate are very likely to respond to jealousy differently from individuals who do not ruminate.  Rumination is positively associated with several communicative responses to jealousy (e.g. compensatory restoration, negative affect expression, showing signs of possession, and derogation of competitors) that attempt to strengthen a relationship.  Rumination is also associated with responses that are counterproductive.  Despite efforts to restore relational intimacy, rumination sustains uncertainty, which thereby forms a cycle where rumination is sustained.  Rumination intensifies over time and serves as a constant reminder to the threat to the relationship, resulting in increased negative affect.  This negative affect is associated with destructive responses to jealousy including violent communication and violence towards objects.  Finally, jealous rumination is associated with relational distress and counterproductive responses to jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;Carson and Cupach, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sex differences in jealous emotions and communication====
Women generally experience more hurt, sadness, anxiety, and confusion than men, perhaps because they often [[blame]] themselves for the jealous situation.  Conversely, men have been found to deny jealous feelings and focus on increasing their self-esteem.  Generally speaking, women tend to be more focused on the relationship, while men tend to be more focused on individual concerns.  In communicative responses, women tend to use integrative communication, express negative affect, enhance their appearance, and use counterjealousy induction more often than jealous men.  Jealous men more often contact the rival, restrict the partner's access to potential rivals, and give gifts and spend money on the partner.  Jealous men also engage in dangerous behaviors, such as getting drunk and engaging in promiscuous sex with others.  Analysis from an evolutionary perspective would suggest that men focus on competing for mates and displaying resources (e.g., material goods to suggest financial security), while women focus on creating and enhancing social bonds and showcasing their beauty.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

===Deception===
{{Main|Interpersonal deception theory|Deception}}
Deception is a major relational transgression that often leads to feelings of betrayal and distrust between relational partners.  Deception violates relational [[Norm (sociology)|rules]] and is considered to be a negative violation of expectations.  Most people expect friends, relational partners, and even strangers to be truthful most of the time.  If people expected most conversations to be untruthful, talking and communicating with others would simply be unproductive and too difficult.  On a given day, it is likely that most human beings will either deceive or be deceived by another person.  A significant amount of deception occurs between romantic and relational partners.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Types====
Deception includes several types of communications or omissions that serve to distort or omit the complete truth.  Deception itself is intentionally managing verbal and/or nonverbal messages so that the message receiver will believe in a way that the message sender knows is false.  Intent is critical with regard to deception.  Intent differentiates between deception and an honest mistake.  The [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] explores the interrelation between 
communicative context and sender and receiver cognitions and behaviors in deceptive exchanges.  

Five primary forms of deception consist of the following:
* '''[[Lie]]s''': Making up information or giving information that is the opposite or very different from the truth.
* '''[[Equivocations]]''': Making an indirect, ambiguous, or contradictory statement.
* '''[[Lie#Lying_by_omission|Concealments]]''': Omitting information that is important or relevant to the given context, or engaging in behavior that helps hide relevant information.
* '''[[Exaggeration]]''': Overstatement or stretching the truth to a degree.
* '''[[Minimisation (psychology)|Understatement]]''': Minimization or downplaying aspects of the truth.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Motives====
There are three primary motivations for deceptions in close relationships.
*'''Partner-focused motives''': Using deception to avoid hurting the partner, helping the partner to enhance or maintain his or her [[self-esteem]], avoid worrying the partner, and protecting the partner's relationship with a third party.  Partner-motivated deception can sometimes be viewed as socially polite and relationally beneficial.
*'''Self-focused motives''':  Using deception to enhance or protect their [[self-image]], wanting to shield themselves from [[anger]], [[embarrassment]], or [[criticism]]. Self-focused deception is generally perceived as a more serious transgression than partner-focused deception because the deceiver is acting for selfish reasons rather than for the good of the relationship.
*'''Relationship-focused motives''': Using deception to limit relationship harm by avoiding conflict or relational trauma.  Relationally motivated deception can be beneficial to a relationship, and other times it can be harmful by further complicating matters.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Detection====
Deception detection between relational partners is extremely difficult, unless a partner tells a blatant or obvious lie or contradicts something the other partner knows to be true.  While it is difficult to deceive a partner over a long period of time, deception often occurs in day-to-day conversations between relational partners.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;   Detecting deception is difficult because there are no known completely reliable indicators of deception.  Deception, however, places a significant cognitive load on the deceiver.  He or she must recall previous statements so that his or her story remains consistent and believable.  As a result, deceivers often leak important information both verbally and nonverbally.  

Deception and its detection is a complex, fluid, and cognitive process that is based on the context of the message exchange.  The [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] posits that interpersonal deception is a dynamic, iterative process of mutual influence between a sender, who manipulates information to depart from the truth, and a receiver, who attempts to establish the validity of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Buller &amp; Burgoon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  A deceiver's actions are interrelated to the message receiver's actions.  It is during this exchange that the deceiver will reveal verbal and nonverbal information about deceit.&lt;ref&gt;Burgoon &amp; Qin, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Some research has found that there are some cues that may be correlated with deceptive communication, but scholars frequently disagree about the effectiveness of many of these cues to serve as reliable indicators.  Noted deception scholar Aldert Vrij even states that there is no nonverbal behavior that is uniquely associated with deception.&lt;ref name="Vrij, 2008"&gt;Vrij, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;   As previously stated, a specific behavioral indicator of deception does not exist.  There are, however, some nonverbal behaviors that have been found to be correlated with deception.  Vrij found that examining a "cluster" of these cues was a significantly more reliable indicator of deception than examining a single cue.&lt;ref name="Vrij, 2008"/&gt; 

In terms of perceptions about the significance of deceiving a partner, women and men typically differ in their beliefs about deception.  Women view deception as a much more profound relational transgression than men.  Additionally, women rate lying in general as a less acceptable behavior than men.  Finally, women are much more likely to view any act of lying as significant (regardless of the subject matter) and more likely to report negative emotional reactions to lying.

=====Truth bias=====
The truth bias significantly impairs the ability of relational partners to detect deception.  In terms of deception, a truth bias reflects a tendency to judge more messages as truths than lies, independent of their actual veracity.&lt;ref&gt;Burgoon, Blair, and Strom, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  When judging message veracity, the truth bias contributes to an overestimate of the actual number of truths relative to the base rate of actual truths.  The truth bias is especially strong within close relationships.  People are highly inclined to trust the communications of others and are unlikely to question the relational partner unless faced with a major deviation of behavior that forces a reevaluation.  When attempting to detect deceit from a familiar person or relational partner, a large amount of information about the partner is brought to mind.  This information essentially overwhelms the receiver's cognitive ability to detect and process any cues to deception.  It is somewhat easier to detect deception in strangers, when less information about that person is brought to mind.&lt;ref&gt;Millar and Millar, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurtful messages===
Messages that convey negative feelings or rejection lead to emotions such as hurt and anger. Hurtful messages are associated with less satisfying relationships.  Intentionally hurtful messages are among the most serious, as perceived by a partner.  Unlike physical pain that usually subsides over time, hurtful messages and hurt feelings often persist for a long period of time and be recalled even years after the event.  The interpersonal damage caused by hurtful messages is sometimes permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Springer, Negel, Ansell, and Evans, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  People are more likely to be upset if they believe their relational partner said something to deliberately hurt them.  Some of the most common forms of hurtful messages include evaluations, accusations, and informative statements.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  

Feeling devalued is a central component of hurtful messages.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Similar to verbally aggressive messages, hurtful messages that are stated intensely may be viewed as particularly detrimental. The cliché "It's not what you say, but how you say it" is very applicable with regard to recipients' appraisals of hurtful messages.&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Females tend to experience more hurt than males in response to hurtful messages.&lt;ref&gt;Fine and Olson, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repairing the damage==

===Conceptualizing forgiveness===
{{Main|Forgiveness}}
Individuals tend to experience a wide array of complex [[emotion]]s following a relational transgression.  These emotions are shown to have utility as an initial coping mechanism.&lt;ref name="Metts, S., &amp; Cupach, W., 2007"&gt;Metts, S., &amp; Cupach, W., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, fear can result in a protective orientation following a serious transgression;&lt;ref&gt;Izard &amp; Ackerman, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; sadness results in contemplation and reflection &lt;ref&gt;Barr-Zisowitz, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; while disgust causes us to repel from its source.&lt;ref&gt;Rozin, Haidt, &amp; McCauley, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  However, beyond the initial situation these emotions can be detrimental to one’s mental
and physical state.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, Exline, &amp; Sommer, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, forgiveness is viewed as a more productive means of dealing with the transgression along with engaging the one who committed the transgression.&lt;ref name="Metts, S., &amp; Cupach, W., 2007"/&gt;

Forgiving is not the act of excusing or condoning.  Rather, it is the process whereby negative emotions are transformed into positive emotions for the purpose of bringing emotional normalcy to a relationship.  In order to achieve this transformation the offended must forgo retribution and claims for retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Boon &amp; Sulsky, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  McCullough, Worthington, and Rachal (1997) defined forgiveness as a, “set of motivational changes whereby one becomes (a) decreasingly motivated to retaliate against an offending relationship partner, (b) decreasingly motivated to maintain estrangement from the offender, and (c) increasingly motivated by conciliation and goodwill for the offender, despite the offender’s hurtful actions”.&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, Worthington, and Rachal, 1997, p.323&lt;/ref&gt;  In essence, relational partners choose constructive behaviors that show an emotional commitment and willingness to sacrifice in order to achieve a state of forgiveness.

===Dimensions of forgiveness===
The link between reconciliation and forgiveness involves exploring two dimensions of forgiveness:  intrapsychic and interpersonal.  The '''intrapsychic''' dimension relates to the cognitive processes and interpretations associated with a transgression (i.e. internal state), whereas '''interpersonal''' forgiveness is the interaction between relational partners.  ''Total forgiveness'' is defined as including both the intrapsychic and interpersonal components which brings about a return to the conditions prior to the transgression.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  To only change one’s internal state is ''silent forgiveness'', and only having interpersonal interaction is considered ''hollow forgiveness''.

However, some scholars contend that these two dimensions (intrapsychic and interpersonal) are independent as the complexities associated with forgiveness involve gradations of both dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Fincham, 2000; Worthington, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a partner may not relinquish negative emotions yet choose to remain in the relationship because of other factors (e.g., children, financial concerns, etc.).  Conversely, one may grant forgiveness and release all negative emotions directed toward their partner, and still exit the relationship because trust cannot be restored.  Given this complexity, research has explored whether the transformation of negative emotions to positive emotions eliminates negative affect associated with a given offense.  The conclusions drawn from this research suggest that no correlation exists between forgiveness and unforgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Witvleit, Ludwig, and Vander Lann, 2001; Wade and Worthington, 2003; Konstam, Holmes, and Levine, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Put simply, while forgiveness may be granted for a given transgression, the negative affect may not be reduced a corresponding amount.

===Determinants of forgiveness===
[[Image:Determinants of Forgiveness Graphic.JPG|thumb|upright=2.85|right|alt=Predictors of Forgiveness.|Predictors of forgiveness]] 

McCullough et al. (1998) outlined predictors of forgiveness into four broad categories &lt;ref&gt;McCullough et al., 1998; Metts and Cupach, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*Personality traits of both partners
*Relationship quality
*Nature of the transgression
*Social-cognitive variables

While personality variables and characteristics of the relationship are preexisting to the occurrence of forgiveness, nature of the offense and social-cognitive determinants become apparent at the time of the transgression.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;

====Personality traits of both partners====
Forgivingness is defined as one’s general tendency to forgive transgressions.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this tendency differs from forgiveness which is a response associated with a specific transgression.  Listed below are characteristics of the forgiving personality as described by Emmons (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
*Does not seek revenge; effectively regulates negative affect
*Strong desire for a relationship free of conflict
*Shows empathy toward offender
*Does not personalize hurt associated with transgression

In terms of personality traits, [[agreeableness]] and [[neuroticism]] (i.e., instability, anxiousness, aggression) show consistency in predicting forgivingness and forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, Paunonen, Helmes, &amp; Jackson, 1998; Berry et al., 2001; Berry, Worthington, O’Connor, Parrott, &amp; Wade, 2005; Exline, Baumeister, Bushman, Campbell, &amp; Finkel, 2004; Hoyt et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Since forgiveness requires one to discard any desire for revenge, a vengeful personality tends to not offer forgiveness and may continue to harbor feelings of vengeance long after the transgression occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson et al., 2005; McCullough et al., 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that agreeableness is inversely correlated with motivations for revenge and avoidance, as well as positively correlated with benevolence.  As such, one who demonstrates the personality trait of agreeableness is prone to forgiveness as well as has a general disposition of forgivingness. Conversely, neuroticism was positively correlated with avoidance and vengefulness, but negatively correlated with benevolence.  Consequently, a neurotic personality is less apt to forgive or to have a disposition of forgivingness.

Though the personality traits of the offended have a predictive value of forgiveness, the personality of the offender also has an effect on whether forgiveness is offered.  Offenders who show sincerity when seeking forgiveness and are persuasive in downplaying the impact of the transgression will have a positive effect on whether the offended will offer forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt et al., 2005; Wolf-Smith &amp; LaRossa, 1992; Metts and Cupach, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Narcissistic]] personalities, for example, may be categorized as persuasive transgressors.  This is driven by the narcissist to downplay their transgressions, seeing themselves as perfect and seeking to save face at all costs.&lt;ref&gt;Exline et al, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a dynamic suggests that personality determinants of forgiveness may involve not only the personality of the offended, but also that of the offender.

====Relationship quality====
The quality of a relationship between offended and offending partners can affect whether forgiveness is both sought and given.  In essence, the more invested one is in a relationship, the more prone they are to minimize the hurt associated with transgressions and seek reconciliation.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  

McCullough et al. (1998) provides seven reasons behind why those in relationships will seek to forgive:&lt;ref&gt;McCullough et al., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
# High investment in relationship (e.g., children, joint finances, etc.)
# Views relationship as long term commitment
# Have high degree of common interests
# Is selfless in regard to their partner
# Willingness to take viewpoint of partner (i.e. empathy)
# Assumes motives of partner are in best interest of relationship (e.g., criticism is taken as constructive feedback)
# Willingness to apologize for transgressions

Relationship maintenance activities are a critical component to maintaining high quality relationships.  While being heavily invested tends to lead to forgiveness, one may be in a skewed relationship where the partner who is heavily invested is actually under benefitted.  This leads to an over benefitted partner who is likely to take the relationship for granted and will not be as prone to exhibit relationship repair behaviors.  As such, being mindful of the quality of a relationship will best position partners to address transgressions through a stronger willingness to forgive and seek to normalize the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Fincham et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Another relationship factor that affects forgiveness is history of past conflict.  If past conflicts ended badly (i.e., reconciliation/forgiveness was either not achieved or achieved after much conflict), partners will be less prone to seek out or offer forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted earlier, maintaining a balanced relationship (i.e. no partner over/under benefitted) has a positive effect on relationship quality and tendency to forgive.  In that same vein, partners are more likely to offer forgiveness if their partners had recently forgiven them for a transgression.&lt;ref&gt;Metts, Morse et al., 
2001&lt;/ref&gt;  However, if a transgression is repeated resentment begins to build which has an adverse effect on the offended partner’s desire to offer forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;

====Nature of the transgression====
The most notable feature of a transgression to have an effect on forgiveness is the seriousness of the offense.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  Some transgressions are perceived as being so serious that they are considered unforgivable.&lt;ref&gt;Younger et al., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  To counter the negative affect associated with a severe transgression, the offender may engage in repair strategies to lessen the perceived hurt of the transgression.  The offender’s communication immediately following a transgression has the greatest predictive value on whether forgiveness will be granted.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  

Consequently, offenders who immediately apologize, take responsibility and show remorse have the greatest chance of obtaining forgiveness from their partner.&lt;ref&gt;McCullough et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, self-disclosure of a transgression yields much greater results than if a partner is informed of the transgression through a third party.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  By taking responsibility for one’s actions and being forthright through self-disclosure of an offense, partners may actually form closer bonds from the reconciliation associated with a serious transgression.  As noted in the section on personality, repeated transgressions cause these relationship repair strategies to have a more muted effect as resentment begins to build and trust erodes.

==== Social-cognitive variables ====
Attributions of responsibility for a given transgression may have an adverse effect on forgiveness.  Specifically, if a transgression is viewed as intentional or malicious, the offended partner is less likely to feel empathy and forgive.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  Based on the notion that forgiveness is driven primarily by empathy, the offender must accept responsibility and seek forgiveness immediately following the transgression, as apologies have shown to elicit empathy from the offended partner.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  The resulting feelings of empathy elicited in the offended partner may cause them to better relate to the guilt and loneliness their partner may feel as a result of the transgression.  In this state of mind, the offended partner is more likely to seek to normalize the relationship through granting forgiveness and restoring closeness with their partner.&lt;ref&gt;McCullough et al, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remedial strategies for the offender===
Prior sections offered definitions of forgiveness along with determinants of forgiveness from the perspective of the partner who has experienced the hurtful transgression.  As noted earlier, swift apologies and utilization of repair strategies by the offender have the greatest likelihood of eliciting empathy from the offended and ultimately receiving forgiveness for the transgression.  The sections below address remedial strategies offenders may use to facilitate a state in which the offended more likely to offer forgiveness and seek to normalize the relationship.

====Apologies/concessions====
Most common of the remedial strategies, an apology is the most straightforward means by which to admit responsibility, express regret, and seek forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Noted earlier, apologies are most effective if provided in a timely manner and involve a self-disclosure.  Apologies occurring after discovery of a transgression by a third party are much less effective.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Though apologies can range from a simple, “I’m sorry” to more elaborate forms, offenders are most successful when offering more complex apologies to match the seriousness of the transgression.&lt;ref&gt;Darby &amp; Schlenker, 1982, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

====Excuses/justifications====
{{see also|Rationalization (making excuses)}}
Rather than accepting responsibility for a transgression through the form of an apology, a transgressor who explains why they engaged in a behavior is engaging in excuses or justifications.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  While excuses and justifications aim to minimize blame on the transgressor, the two address blame minimization from completely opposite perspectives. Excuses attempt to [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimize]] [[blame]] by focusing on a transgressor’s inability to control their actions (e.g., “How would I have known my exgirlfriend was going to be at the party.”) or displace blame on a third party (e.g., “I went to lunch with my exgirlfriend because I did not want to hurt her feelings.”)&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Conversely, a justification minimizes blame by suggesting that actions surrounding the transgression were justified or that the transgression was not severe.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  For example, a transgressor may justify having lunch with a past romantic interest, suggesting to their current partner that the lunch meeting was of no major consequence (e.g., “We are just friends.”)

====Refusals====
Refusals are where a transgressor claims no blame for the perceived transgression.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  This is a departure from apologies and excuses/justifications which involve varying degrees of blame acceptance.  In the case of a refusal, the transgressor believes that they have not done anything wrong.  Such a situation points out the complexity of relational transgressions.  Perception of both partners must be taken into account when recognizing and addressing transgressions.  For example, Bob and Sally have just started to date, but have not addressed whether they are mutually exclusive.  When Bob finds out that Sally has been on a date with someone else, he confronts Sally.  Sally may engage in refusal of blame because Bob and Sally had not explicitly noted whether they were mutually exclusive.  The problem with these situations is that the transgressor shows no sensitivity to the offended.  As such, the offended is less apt to exhibit empathy which is key towards forgiveness.  As such, research has shown that refusals tend to aggravate situations, rather than serve as a meaningful repair strategy.&lt;ref name ="Mongeau et al., 1994"&gt;Mongeau et al., 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

====Appeasement/positivity====
Appeasement is used to offset hurtful behavior through the transgressor ingratiating themselves in ways such as promising never to commit the hurtful act or being overly kind to their partner.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Appeasement may elicit greater empathy from the offended, through soothing strategies exhibited by the transgressor (e.g., complimenting, being more attentive, spending greater time together).  However, the danger of appeasement is the risk that the actions of transgressor will be viewed as being artificial.  For example, sending your partner flowers every day resulting from an infidelity you have committed, may be viewed as downplaying the severity of the transgression if the sending of flowers is not coupled with other soothing strategies that cause greater immediacy.

====Avoidance/evasion====
Avoidance involves the transgressor making conscious efforts to ignore the transgression (also referred to as “silence”).&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Avoidance can be effective after an apology is sought and forgiveness is granted (i.e., minimizing discussion around unpleasant subjects once closure has been obtained).  However, total avoidance of a transgression where the hurt of the offended is not recognized and forgiveness is not granted can result in further problems in the future.  As relational transgressions tend to develop the nature of the relationship through drawing of new [[Norm (sociology)|rules]]/boundaries, avoidance of a transgression does not allow for this development.  Not surprisingly, avoidance is ineffective as a repair strategy, particularly for instances in which [[infidelity]] has occurred.&lt;ref name="Mongeau et al., 1994"/&gt;

====Relationship talk====
Relationship talk is a remediation strategy that focuses on discussing the transgression in the context of the relationship.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Aune et al. (1998) identified two types of relationship talk, relationship invocation and metatalk.&lt;ref&gt;Aune et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Relationship invocation''' involves using the relationship as a backdrop for a discussion of the transgression.  For example, “We are too committed to this relationship to let it fail.”, or “Our relationship is so much better than any of my previous relationships.” '''Metatalk''' involves discussing the effect of the transgression on the relationship.  For example, [[infidelity]] may cause partners to redefine [[Norm (sociology)|rules]] of the relationship and reexamine the expectations of commitment each partner expects from the other.

==Summary and application of concepts==
Relational transgressions are a part of any relationship.  In each instance, partners must weigh the severity of the transgression against how much they value the relationship.  In some cases, trust can be so severely damaged that repair strategies are fruitless.  With each transgression both transgressor and victim assume risks.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  The transgressor’s efforts at reconciliation may be rejected by the victim, which results in loss of face and potentially an avenue of attack by the victim.  If the victim offers forgiveness, there is risk that the transgressor may view the forgiveness as a personality trait that may prompt future transgressions (e.g., “I’ll be forgiven by my partner just like every other time”).

These risks aside, promptly engaging in repair strategies helps to ensure the relationship recovers from transgressions.  Addressing relational transgressions can be a very painful process.  Utilizing repair strategies can have a transformative effect on the relationship through redefining [[Norm (sociology)|rules]] and boundaries.  An added benefit can be gained through the closeness that can be realized as partners address transgressions.  Engaging in relationship talk such as metatalk prompts broader discussions about what each partner desires from the relationship and aligns expectations.  Such efforts can mitigate the effects of future transgressions, or even minimize the frequency and severity of transgressions.

[[File:Scientific law versus Scientific theories.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Scientific theories explain why something happens, whereas Scientific Laws record what happens.]]
The '''laws of science''', also called '''[[scientific law]]s''' or '''scientific principles''', are statements that describe or [[prediction|predict]] a range of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|law of nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each scientific law is a statement based on [[reproducibility|repeated]] [[experiment]]al [[observation]]s that describes some aspect of the [[Universe]]. The term ''law'' has diverse usage in many cases (approximate, accurate, broad, or narrow [[scientific theory|theories]]) across all fields of [[natural science]] ([[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], etc.). Scientific laws summarize and explain a large collection of facts determined by [[experiment]], and are tested based on their ability to predict the results of future experiments. They are developed either from facts or through [[mathematics]], and are strongly supported by [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] [[evidence]]. It is generally understood that they reflect causal relationships fundamental to reality, and are discovered rather than invented.&lt;ref name="McComas2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. McComas|title=The Language of Science Education: An Expanded Glossary of Key Terms and Concepts in Science Teaching and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXzGBAAAQBAJ|date=30 December 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-497-0|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws reflect scientific knowledge that experiments have repeatedly verified (and never [[Falsifiability|falsified]]). Their accuracy does not change when new theories are worked out, but rather the scope of application, since the equation (if any) representing the law does not change. As with other scientific knowledge, they do not have absolute certainty (as mathematical [[theorems]] or [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] do), and it is always possible for a law to be overturned by future observations. A law can usually be formulated as one or several statements or [[equation]]s, so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment, given the circumstances of the processes taking place.

Laws differ from [[hypotheses]] and [[postulates]], which are proposed during the [[Scientific method|scientific process]] before and during validation by experiment and observation. [[Hypotheses]] and [[postulates]] are not laws since they have not been verified to the same degree and may not be sufficiently general, although they may lead to the formulation of laws. A law is a more solidified and formal statement, distilled from repeated experiment. Laws are narrower in scope than [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], which may contain one or several laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/evolution/education/definitions-fact-theory-law-scientific-work Definitions from the NCSE]&lt;/ref&gt; Science distinguishes a law or theory from facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/role_of_theory_final.pdf | title=The Role of Theory in Advancing 21st Century Biology: Catalyzing Transformative Research |publisher = The National Academy of Sciences |year =2007 |journal=Report in Brief |}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling a law a [[scientific fact|fact]] is [[ambiguous]], an [[overstatement]], or an [[equivocation]].&lt;ref name=gouldfact&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title  = Evolution as Fact and Theory | journal = Discover | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date = 1981-05-01 | pages = 34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the nature of a scientific law is a question in [[philosophy]] and although scientific laws describe nature mathematically, scientific laws are practical conclusions reached by the [[scientific method]]; they are intended to be neither laden with [[ontology|ontological]] commitments nor statements of logical [[wikt:absolute#Noun|absolutes]].

According to the [[unity of science]] thesis, ''all'' scientific laws follow fundamentally from physics. Laws which occur in other sciences ultimately follow from [[physical law]]s. Often, from mathematically fundamental viewpoints, [[universal constant]]s emerge from a scientific law.

==Overview==
A scientific law always applies under the same conditions, and implies that there is a causal relationship involving its elements. [[Scientific fact|Factual]] and well-confirmed statements like "Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the [[philosophy of science]], going back to [[David Hume]], is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to [[constant conjunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Laws differ from [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. [[Ohm's law]] only applies to linear networks, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of [[aerodynamics]] such as [[Bernoulli's principle]] do not apply in case of [[compressible flow]] such as occurs in [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] flight, [[Hooke's law]] only applies to [[strain (physics)|strain]] below the [[elastic limit]], etc. These laws remain useful, but only under the conditions where they apply.

Many laws take [[mathematics|mathematical]] forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the [[law of conservation of energy]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta E = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U=\delta Q-\delta W\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The term "scientific law" is traditionally associated with the [[natural sciences]], though the [[social sciences]] also contain laws.&lt;ref name=Ehrenberg&gt;[[Andrew S. C. Ehrenberg]] (1993), "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6445/pdf/365385a0.pdf Even the Social Sciences Have Laws]", [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], 365:6445 (30), page 385.{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a scientific law in social sciences is [[Zipf's law]].

Like theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]] if they are found in contradiction with new data.

== Conservation laws ==

===Conservation and symmetry===
{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}

Most significant laws in science are [[conservation laws]]. These fundamental laws follow from homogeneity of space, time and [[phase (waves)|phase]], in other words ''symmetry''.

*'''[[Noether's theorem]]:''' Any quantity which has a continuous differentiable symmetry in the action has an associated conservation law.
* [[Conservation of mass]] was the first law of this type to be understood, since most macroscopic physical processes involving masses, for example collisions of massive particles or fluid flow, provide the apparent belief that mass is conserved. Mass conservation was observed to be true for all chemical reactions. In general this is only approximative, because with the advent of relativity and experiments in nuclear and particle physics: mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa, so mass is not always conserved, but part of the more general conservation of mass-energy.
*'''[[Conservation of energy]]''', '''[[Conservation of momentum|momentum]]''' and '''[[Conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]]''' for isolated systems can be found to be [[Time translation symmetry|symmetries in time]], translation, and rotation.
*'''[[Conservation of charge]]''' was also realized since charge has never been observed to be created or destroyed, and only found to move from place to place.

===Continuity and transfer===

Conservation laws can be expressed using the general [[continuity equation]] (for a conserved quantity) can be written in differential form as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}=-\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} &lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is some quantity per unit volume, '''J''' is the [[flux]] of that quantity (change in quantity per unit time per unit area). Intuitively, the [[divergence]] (denoted ∇•) of a [[vector field]] is a measure of flux diverging radially outwards from a point, so the negative is the amount piling up at a point, hence the rate of change of density in a region of space must be the amount of flux leaving or collecting in some region (see main article for details). In the table below, the fluxes, flows for various physical quantities in transport, and their associated continuity equations, are collected for comparison.

More general equations are the [[convection–diffusion equation]] and [[Boltzmann transport equation]], which have their roots in the continuity equation.

==Laws of classical mechanics==

===Principle of least action===

{{Main|Principle of least action}}

All of classical mechanics, including [[Newton's laws]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]], etc., can be derived from this very simple principle:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{S} = \delta\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[action (physics)|action]]; the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]

:&lt;math&gt; L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) = T(\mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)-V(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)&lt;/math&gt;

of the physical system between two times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The kinetic energy of the system is ''T'' (a function of the rate of change of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system), and [[potential energy]] is ''V'' (a function of the configuration and its rate of change). The configuration of a system which has ''N'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] is defined by [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'').

There are [[Canonical coordinates|generalized momenta]] conjugate to these coordinates, '''p''' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''), where:

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}&lt;/math&gt;

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term "path" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the [[generalized coordinates]] in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).

The action is a ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' rather than a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'', since it depends on the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian depends on the path '''q'''(''t''), so the action depends on the ''entire'' "shape" of the path for all times (in the time interval from ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Between two instants of time, there are infinitely many paths, but one for which the action is stationary (to the first order) is the true path. The stationary value for the ''entire continuum'' of Lagrangian values corresponding to some path, ''not just one value'' of the Lagrangian, is required (in other words it is ''not'' as simple as "differentiating a function and setting it to zero, then solving the equations to find the points of [[maxima and minima]] etc", rather this idea is applied to the entire "shape" of the function, see [[calculus of variations]] for more details on this procedure).&lt;ref&gt;Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume 2, R.P. Feynman, R.B. Leighton, M. Sands, Addison-Wesley, 1964, {{isbn|0-201-02117-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notice ''L'' is ''not'' the total energy ''E'' of the system due to the difference, rather than the sum:

:&lt;math&gt;E=T+V&lt;/math&gt;

Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw-Hill (UK), 1973, {{isbn|0-07-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; general approaches to classical mechanics are summarized below in the order of establishment. They are equivalent formulations, Newton's is very commonly used due to simplicity, but Hamilton's and Lagrange's equations are more general, and their range can extend into other branches of physics with suitable modifications.

Using the definition of generalized momentum, there is the symmetry:

'''[[Newton's laws of motion]]'''

They are low-limit solutions to [[theory of relativity|relativity]]. Alternative formulations of Newtonian mechanics are [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] mechanics.

The laws can be summarized by two equations (since the 1st is a special case of the 2nd, zero resultant acceleration):

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}, \quad \mathbf{F}_{ij}=-\mathbf{F}_{ji} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''p''' = momentum of body, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''i'' ''by'' body ''j'', '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''j'' ''by'' body ''i''.

For a [[dynamical system]] the two equations (effectively) combine into one:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}_\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{F}_{E} + \sum_{\mathrm{i} \neq \mathrm{j}} \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{ij} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = resultant external force (due to any agent not part of system). Body ''i'' does not exert a force on itself.

==Laws of gravitation and relativity==

===Modern laws===

;[[Special relativity]]

Postulates of special relativity are not "laws" in themselves, but assumptions of their nature in terms of ''relative motion''.

Often two are stated as "the laws of physics are the same in all [[inertial frames]]" and "the [[speed of light]] is constant". However the second is redundant, since the speed of light is predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]]. Essentially there is only one.

The said posulate leads to the [[Lorentz transformations]] – the transformation law between two [[frame of reference]]s moving relative to each other. For any [[4-vector]]

:&lt;math&gt;A' =\Lambda A &lt;/math&gt;

this replaces the [[Galilean transformation]] law from classical mechanics. The Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformations for low velocities much less than the speed of light ''c''.

The magnitudes of 4-vectors are invariants - ''not'' "conserved", but the same for all inertial frames (i.e. every observer in an inertial frame will agree on the same value), in particular if ''A'' is the [[four-momentum]], the magnitude can derive the famous invariant equation for mass-energy and momentum conservation (see [[invariant mass]]):

:&lt;math&gt; E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

in which the (more famous) [[mass-energy equivalence]] ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a special case.

;[[General relativity]]

General relativity is governed by the [[Einstein field equation]]s, which describe the curvature of space-time due to mass-energy equivalent to the gravitational field. Solving the equation for the geometry of space warped due to the mass distribution gives the [[metric tensor]]. Using the geodesic equation, the motion of masses falling along the geodesics can be calculated.

;[[Gravitomagnetism]]

In a relatively flat spacetime due to weak gravitational fields, gravitational analogues of Maxwell's equations can be found; the '''GEM equations''', to describe an analogous ''[[Gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic field]]''. They are well established by the theory, and experimental tests form ongoing research.&lt;ref name="Gravitation and Inertia"&gt;Gravitation and Inertia, I. Ciufolini and J.A.

These equations can be modified to include [[magnetic monopole]]s, and are consistent with our observations of monopoles either existing or not existing; if they do not exist, the generalized equations reduce to the ones above, if they do, the equations become fully symmetric in electric and magnetic charges and currents. Indeed, there is a duality transformation where electric and magnetic charges can be "rotated into one another", and still satisfy Maxwell's equations.

;Pre-Maxwell laws

These laws were found before the formulation of Maxwell's equations. They are not fundamental, since they can be derived from Maxwell's Equations. Coulomb's Law can be found from Gauss' Law (electrostatic form) and the Biot–Savart Law can be deduced from Ampere's Law (magnetostatic form). Lenz' Law and Faraday's Law can be incorporated into the Maxwell-Faraday equation. Nonetheless they are still very effective for simple calculations.

== Laws of quantum mechanics==

Quantum mechanics has its roots in [[postulates of quantum mechanics|postulates]]. This leads to results which are not usually called "laws", but hold the same status, in that all of quantum mechanics follows from them.

One postulate that a particle (or a system of many particles) is described by a [[wavefunction]], and this satisfies a quantum wave equation: namely the [[Schrödinger equation]] (which can be written as a non-relativistic wave equation, or a [[relativistic wave equation]]). Solving this wave equation predicts the time-evolution of the system's behaviour, analogous to solving Newton's laws in classical mechanics.

Other postulates change the idea of physical observables; using [[operators (physics)|quantum operators]]; some measurements can't be made at the same instant of time ([[Uncertainty principle]]s), particles are fundamentally indistinguishable. Another postulate; the [[wavefunction collapse]] postulate, counters the usual idea of a measurement in science.

== Laws of chemistry ==
{{Main|Chemical law}}

'''Chemical laws''' are those [[natural law|laws of nature]] relevant to [[chemistry]]. Historically, observations led to many empirical laws, though now it is known that chemistry has its foundations in [[quantum mechanics]].

;[[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|Quantitative analysis]]

The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the [[law of conservation of mass]], which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary [[chemical reaction]]. Modern physics shows that it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that [[Mass–energy equivalence|energy and mass are related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]]. [[Conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].

Additional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass.  [[Joseph Proust]]'s [[law of definite composition]] says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.

[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s [[law of multiple proportions]] says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers (i.e. 1:2 for [[Oxygen]]:[[Hydrogen]] ratio in water); although in many systems (notably [[Biomolecule|biomacromolecules]] and [[minerals]]) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.

More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and its transformations.

;[[Reaction kinetics]] and [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibria]]

* In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules—the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. [[Le Chatelier's principle]] states that the system opposes changes in conditions from equilibrium states, i.e. there is an opposition to change the state of an equilibrium reaction.
* Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations.  The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs.
* There is a hypothetical intermediate, or ''transition structure'', that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier.  The [[Hammond's postulate|Hammond–Leffler postulate]] states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier.  Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve [[catalysis]].
* All chemical processes are reversible (law of [[microscopic reversibility]]) although some processes have such an energy bias, they are essentially irreversible.
* The reaction rate has the mathematical parameter known as the [[rate constant]]. The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the temperature and [[activation energy]] dependence of the rate constant, an empirical law.

[[Self-esteem]] can be defined as how favorably individuals evaluate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R.F. &amp; Bushman, B. (2008). Social Psychology and Human Nature (1st Edition). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth. .&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leary, self-esteem is the relationship between one’s real self and one’s ideal self, feeding off of favorable behaviors.&lt;ref name="leary1999"&gt;Leary, M.R. (1999) Making Sense of Self-Esteem. Current Directions in Psychological Science 8 (1), 32–35.&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to an individual's sense of his or her value or worth, or the extent to which a person values, approves of, appreciates, prizes, or likes him or herself.&lt;ref name="Adler, N 2004"&gt;Adler, N &amp; Stewart, J ( 2004) Self-Esteem. Research Network on SES &amp; Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-esteem is generally considered the evaluative component of the self-concept, a broader representation of the self that includes cognitive and behavioral aspects as well as evaluative or affective ones.&lt;ref name="Adler, N 2004"/&gt; There are several different proposals as to the functions of self-esteem. One proposal includes to satisfy the inherent need to feel good about one self. Another one would be to minimize social rejection .&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, D. B., Wood, J. V., &amp; Holmes, J. G. (2007). Testing sociometer theory: Self-esteem and the importance of acceptance for social decision-making. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 43(3), 425-432.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leary1999" /&gt; Self-esteem is also known as A way for a person to remain dominant in relationships (Barkow, 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, J. (1980). Prestige and self-esteem: A biosocial interpretation. In D. R. Omark, F. F. Strayer, &amp; D. G. Freedman (Eds.), Dominance relations: An ethological view of human conflict and social interaction (pp. 319–332). New York: Garland STPM Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-esteem is known to protect people from fear that has potential of arising from the prospect of death- terror management theory.&lt;ref name="leary1999" /&gt; Self-esteem helps motivate people to achieve their goals- high self-esteem leading to coping in situations and low self-esteem leading to avoidance.&lt;ref name="leary1999" /&gt;

==Evolutionary perspectives==
===Sociometer theory===
{{Main|Sociometer}}
The sociometer theory was developed by Mark Leary (1999)&lt;ref name="leary1999"/&gt; to explain the functions of self-esteem. A sociometer is a measure of how desirable one would be to other people - this is influenced by one’s self-esteem. They suggested that self-esteem has evolved to monitor one’s social acceptance and is used as a gauge for avoiding social devaluation and rejection.
The sociometer theory is strongly grounded in evolutionary theories which suggest that survival depends on social acceptance for reasons such as protection, reciprocal behaviours and most importantly reproduction. The monitoring of one's acceptance via self-esteem is therefore crucial in order to achieve these kinds of social interactions and be better able to compete for the social benefits of them.

Kirkpatrick and Ellis (2003) expanded on Leary’s work and suggested that the sociometer’s function was not only to ensure that an individual was not excluded from their social group but also to rate the strength of the social group compared to other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, L. A., &amp; Ellis, B. J. (2001). An evolutionary-psychological approach to self-esteem: multiple domains and multiple functions. In G. J. O. Fletcher &amp; M. S. Clark (Eds.), Blackwell handbook of social psychology: Interpersonal processes (pp. 411-436). Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Leary and his colleagues stated that a sociometer is a measure of how a person is desirable by the people and this is oftentimes influenced through a person's self-esteem.

===Self-determination theory===
{{Main|Self-determination theory}}
Self-determination theory (SDT) states that man is born with an intrinsic motivation to explore, absorb and master his surroundings and that true high self-esteem is reported when the basic psychological nutrients, or needs, of life (relatedness, competency and autonomy) are in balance Nayler, C. (2005) Theories of Self Esteem. Positive Psychology.

===Ethological perspective===
The ethological perspective (Barkow, 1980) suggests that self-esteem is an adaptation that has evolved for the purpose of maintaining dominance in relationships. It is said that human beings have evolved certain mechanisms for monitoring dominance in order to facilitate reproductive behaviours such attaining a mate. Because attention and favorable reactions from others were associated with being dominant, feelings of self-esteem have also become associated with social approval and deference. From this perspective, the motive to evaluate oneself positively in evolutionary terms is to enhance one’s relative dominance (Leary, 1999).

Leary et al. (2001) tested the idea of dominance and social acceptance on self-esteem. Trait self-esteem appeared to be related to the degree to which participants felt accepted by specific people in their lives, but not to the degree to which participants thought those individuals perceived them as dominant. Acceptance and dominance appeared to have independent effects on self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, M.R., Cottrell, C.A. &amp; Phillips, M. (2001) Deconfounding the effects of dominance and social acceptance on self-esteem Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 81(5), 898-909.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terror management theory===
{{Main|Terror management theory}}
The terror management theory, developed by [[Sheldon Solomon]] at al. (1991),&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, S., Greenberg, J., &amp; Pyszczynski, T. (1991). A terror management theory of social behavior: The psychological functions of self-esteem and cultural worldviews. Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 24, 93–159.&lt;/ref&gt; which in relation to self-esteem states that having self-esteem helps protect individuals from the fear they experience at the prospect of their own death. It is suggested that people are constantly searching for ways to enhance their self-esteem in order to quell unconscious death anxiety. This internalisation of cultural values is also a key factor in Terror Management Theory (TMT) in which self-esteem is seen as a culturally based construction derived from integrating specific contingencies valued by society into one's own ‘worldview’. High self-esteem promotes positive affect and personal growth, psychological well-being and coping as a buffer against anxiety in the knowledge of our eventual certain death, and reduces defensive anxiety related behaviour. Nayler, C. (2005) Theories of Self Esteem. Positive Psychology. Terror management theory, based primarily on the writings of Ernest Becker (1962, 1971, 1973, 1975) and Otto
Rank (1936, 1941), posits that self-esteem is sought because it provides protection against the fear of death (Greenberg, Pyszczynski,
&amp; Solomon, 1986; Solomon, Greenberg, &amp; Pyszczynski,1991a). From this perspective, the fear of death is rooted
in an instinct for self-preservation that humans share with other species. Jones, E. McGreggor, H. Pyszczynski, T. Simon, L. &amp; Solomon, S. (1997). Terror Management
Theory and Self –Esteem Reduces Mortality Salience Effects. Personality and Social Psychology 72, 24-36

Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that self-esteem is a form of subjective feedback about the adequacy of the self. This feedback (self-esteem) is positive when the individual copes well with circumstances and is negative when he or she avoids threats. In turn, self-esteem affects subsequent goal achievement; high self-esteem increases coping, and low self-esteem leads to further avoidance (Leary, 1999).

===Illusion of control===
{{Main|Illusion of control}}
Illusion of control is the tendency for human beings to believe they can control, or at least influence, outcomes that they demonstrably have no influence over, a mindset often seen in those who gamble (Langer, 1975).&lt;ref&gt;Langer, E. J. &amp; Roth, J. (1975). Heads I win, tails it's chance: The illusion of control as a function of the sequence of outcomes in a purely chance task. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 34, 191-198.&lt;/ref&gt; However, for individuals who are not gamblers Taylor and Brown (1988) suggest it may serve to be a function of self-esteem. Belief that there is a level of control over the situation a person is in, may lead to an increased level of motivation and performance in a self-regulating manner.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. E., &amp; Brown, J. D. (1988). Illusion and Well-Being - a Social Psychological Perspective On Mental-Health. Psychological Bulletin, 103(2), 193-210.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, one will work harder to become successful if they believe they have control over their success. A high self-esteem would be needed for this belief of control and so the need for a sense of control may be a function of self-esteem.
When applying sociometer theory, it suggests that the illusion of control is an adaptive response in order to self-regulate behaviour to cultural norms and thereby provide an individual with an increased level of self-esteem. In social psychology, the illusion of control is grouped with two other concepts and termed as the ‘positive illusions’.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11966">The '''situational theory of problem solving''' attempts to explain why and how an individual communicates during a problematic situation. The Situational Theory of Problem Solving (STOPS) was proposed by Jeong-Nam Kim and [[James E. Grunig]] in 2011 though their article “problem solving and communicative action: A situational theory of problem solving.” The theory was developed from the [[situational theory of publics]] (STP) and claimed it is “an extended and generalized version” of STP.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jeong-Nam|last2=Grunig|first2=James E.|date=2011|year=|title=Problem Solving and Communicative Action: A Situational Theory of Problem Solving|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01529.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=61|issue=1|pages=120–149|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01529.x|issn=1460-2466|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has an assumption that “the more one commits to problem resolution, the more one becomes acquisitive of information pertaining to the problem, selective in dealing with information, and transmissive in giving it to others.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==

=== Extension from situational theory of publics ===
STP has been heavily used in the field of [[public relations]] to understand why and how publics communicate. The original situational theory uses three independent variables (problem recognition, constraint recognition, and involvement recognition) to predict the dependent variable of information seeking and processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aldoory|first=Linda|last2=Kim|first2=Jeong-Nam|last3=Tindall|first3=Natalie|date=2010|year=|title=The influence of perceived shared risk in crisis communication: Elaborating the situational theory of publics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0363811109001994|journal=Public Relations Review|volume=36|issue=2|pages=134–140|doi=10.1016/j.pubrev.2009.12.002|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://succeed.stir.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/courses/PREP86_201314_Autumn_A/Digitised_extracts/PREP86GrunigSituational.pdf|title=Public relations research: an international perspective.|last=Grunig|first=J.|date=1997|publisher=International Thomson Business Press|year=|isbn=0415109957|editor-last=Grunig|editor-first=J|location=London|pages=3–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STOPS was proposed to overcome four limitations of STP:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# STP considered only information acquisition as a concept of active communication behaviors
# The predictive power of referent criterion variable has been unclear throughout the development of STP
# Only few antecedents of communication behavior were considered
# STP was underutilized because of the narrow concept of information behaviors
Alterations in existed variables (problem recognition, constraint recognition, involvement recognition, and reference criterion) were done to explain communicative action in problem solving variable. STOPS also expanded the focus of the theory from "decisions" to a more general concept of life "problems." A new variable, situational motivation in problem solving, was added to mediate the effects of predictive variables of communicative behavior.

== Concepts of key variables ==

=== Situational antecedents: perceptual and cognitive frame in problem solving ===
* '''Problem Recognition''': “one’s perception that something is missing and that there is no immediately applicable solution to it.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Constraint Recognition:''' perceived obstacles in a problem-solving task that reduce one’s ability to do anything about the issue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Constraint recognition limit one’s communication behaviors even when he or she has high problem recognition and/or involvement recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramanadhan|first=Shoba|last2=Viswanath|first2=K.|date=2006|year=|title=Health and the Information Nonseeker: A Profile|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327027hc2002_4|journal=Health Communication|volume=20|issue=2|pages=131–139|doi=10.1207/s15327027hc2002_4|issn=1041-0236|pmid=16965250|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Involvement Recognition''': “a perceived connection between the self and the problem situation.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This variable has the same concept of the level of involvement in the situational theory of publics.
* '''Referent Criterion''': “any knowledge or subjective judgmental system that influences the way in which one approaches problem solving.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Situational motivation in problem solving ===
The extent to which an individual wants to know more about a problem. This concept mediates the effect of problem recognition, constraint recognition, and involvement recognition. Referent criterion would be independent of this variable because it is more cognitive than perceptual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Communicative behavior in problem solving ===
When an individual tries to solve a problem, his or her communicative activeness increases in three domains of communication action: information acquisition, selection, and transmission.

==== Information acquisition ====
The communicative action that is relevant to the degrees of information searching for problem solving.
* '''Information seeking (active)''': a planned perusing of messages about a specific topic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* '''Information attending (passive)''': an unplanned exposure for messages about a specific topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Peter|last2=Kline|first2=F. Gerald|date=2016|year=|title=Media Effects Reconsidered|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009365027400100205|journal=Communication Research|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=224–240|doi=10.1177/009365027400100205|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Information selection ====
The communicative action that is relevant to the extent of an individual's directedness in acquiring and sharing information.
* '''Information forefending (active)''': “the extent to which a communicator fends off certain information in advance by judging its value and relevance for a given problem-solving task.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Individuals with higher information forefending look for more specific, systematic, and accurate information.
* '''Information permitting (passive)''': the extent to which an individual accept any information related to a problem-solving task.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Information transmission ====
The communicative action that is relevant to the degrees of educating others to utilize collective behaviors for problem solving.
* '''Information forwarding (active)''': forwarding information even if no one requests for one’s opinion, idea, or expertise about a problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Information sharing (passive)''': sharing of information only when other person asks for one’s opinion, idea, or expertise about a problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Model ==
An individual’s perception toward a problematic life situation, motivation to solve the problem, and activation of cognitive frames influence an individual’s activeness in six information behaviors – information forefending, information permitting, information forwarding, information sharing, information seeking, and information attending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Yi-Ru Regina|last2=Hung-Baesecke|first2=Chun-Ju Flora|last3=Kim|first3=Jeong-Nam|date=2017|year=|title=Identifying Active Hot-Issue Communicators and Subgroup Identifiers|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077699016629371|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|language=en|volume=94|issue=1|pages=124–147|doi=10.1177/1077699016629371|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4867">'''The Six Point Group''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[feminism|feminist]] campaign group founded by [[Margaret Mackworth, 2nd Viscountess Rhondda|Lady Rhondda]] in 1921 to press for changes in the law of the United Kingdom in six areas.

==Aims==
The six original specific aims were: 
# Satisfactory legislation on child assault; 
# Satisfactory legislation for the widowed mother; 
# Satisfactory legislation for the unmarried mother and her child; 
# Equal rights of guardianship for married parents; 
# Equal pay for teachers 
# Equal opportunities for men and women in the civil service.

These later evolved into six general points of equality for women: political, occupational, moral, social, economic and legal. 

==History==
The group was founded by [[Margaret Mackworth, 2nd Viscountess Rhondda|Lady Rhondda]] in 1921 to press for changes in the law of the United Kingdom in six areas. The secretary from 1921 to 1926 was the ex-suffragette Winifred Mayo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/WmayoW.htm|title=Winifred Mayo|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, it was active in trying to have the [[League of Nations]] pass an Equal Rights Treaty.

The group campaigned on principles of strict equality between men and women. This 'old feminism' or 'equality feminism' was sometimes contrasted to the 'new feminism' or 'welfare feminism' of other women's groups of the period, such as the [[National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship]], which sought protectionist legislation applying only to women.&lt;ref name=DBWO&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Gordon|first2=David|last2=Doughan|title=Dictionary of British Women's Organisations, 1825-1960|date=2001|publisher=Woburn Press|location=London &amp; Portland, Or.|ISBN=0-7130-0223-9|contribution=Six Point Group|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members included former militant suffragists - such as [[Dorothy E. Evans]], [[Monica Whately]] or [[Helen Archdale]] - as well as younger women like [[Winifred Holtby]] or [[Vera Brittain]]. Though the membership was usually under 300, the Six Point Group wielded considerable political influence in the interwar years and during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=DBWO/&gt; It campaigned by traditional constitutional methods. Much of its work was done through its journal, ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]''. It also made deputations to the appropriate government ministers, organised public rallies and wrote letters to major newspapers.

From 1933, along with the [[Open Door Council]], it spearheaded the movement for the right of married women to work. 

It was responsible for establishing the [[Income Tax Reform Council]] and in 1938, the [[Married Women's Association]]. 

During the [[Second World War]], the Six Point Group campaigned on a variety of issues. They protested about the fact that female volunteers in the Civil Defence Services received only two-thirds the men's pay. They objected that the compensation provided for by the Personal Injuries (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1939 was skewed between male / female recipients. They were closely involved in the Equal Compensation Campaign from 1941 to 1943 and subsequently had representatives alongside the Open Door Council and the [[Fawcett Society]] on the committee of the Equal Pay Campaign from 1944 to ensure equal pay in the Civil Service. 

The group continued to have significant political influence in the post war period. It took  part in the protests to have the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act changed to give married women more financial protection. 

From 1967, the group played an active part in the co-ordination of other women's groups on a number of issues. Its secretary in the 1970s was [[Hazel Hunkins Hallinan]].&lt;ref name=DBWO/&gt; From the late 1970s the group declined through its failure to recruit younger women. It went into abeyance in 1980, and was finally dissolved in 1983.

In neurology and neuroscience research, '''steady state visually evoked potentials''' ('''SSVEP''') are signals that are natural responses to visual [[stimulation]] at specific [[frequency|frequencies]].  When the [[retina]] is excited by a visual stimulus ranging from 3.5&amp;nbsp;[[Hz]] to 75&amp;nbsp;Hz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beverina F, Palmas G, Silvoni S, Piccione F, Giove S | year = 2003 | title = User adaptive BCIs: SSVEP and P300 based interfaces | url = | journal = PsychNol. J. | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 331–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the brain generates electrical activity at the same (or multiples of) frequency of the visual stimulus.

This technique is used widely with [[EEG|electroencephalographic]] research regarding vision and attention.  SSVEPs are useful in research because of the excellent [[signal-to-noise]] ratio&lt;ref&gt;D. Regan, Human Brain Electrophysiology: Evoked Potentials and Evoked Magnetic Fields in Science and Medicine, Elsevier, New York, NY, USA, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and relative immunity to artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;K. E. Misulis, Spehlmann's Evoked Potential Primer, Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, Mass, USA, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  SSVEPs also provide a means to characterize preferred frequencies of neocortical dynamic processes.  SSVEP is generated by stationary localized sources and distributed sources that exhibit characteristics of wave phenomena.

A '''temporal expression''' in a text is a sequence of tokens (words, numbers and characters) that denote time, that is express a point in time, a duration or a frequency. 
Examples:
:A point in time: 
&lt;pre&gt;He was born on &lt;TIMEX&gt;6 May, 1980&lt;/TIMEX&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;
:A duration:
&lt;pre&gt;The show lasted &lt;TIMEX&gt;7 minutes&lt;/TIMEX&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;
:A frequency:
&lt;pre&gt;The pump circulates the water &lt;TIMEX&gt;every 2 hours&lt;/TIMEX&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

Initially, temporal expressions were considered a type of named entities and their identification was part of the [[named entity recognition]] task. Since the Automatic Content Extraction program in 2004 there has been a separate task identified and called Temporal Expression Recognition and Normalisation (TERN). Timex evaluation is now evaluated in two major temporal annotation challenges: [[TempEval]] and [[i2b2]], both of which prefer the [[TimeML]]-level TIMEX3 standard.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://timeml.org/site/publications/timeMLdocs/timeml_1.2.1.html#timex3 TIMEX3 at timeml.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
Similarly to NER systems, temporal expression taggers have been created either using linguistic [[formal grammar|grammar]]-based techniques or [[statistical model]]s. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtained better results, but at the cost of months of work by experienced linguists. There are many such systems available now,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strötgen|first=Jannik|author2=Michael Gertz |title=HeidelTime: High quality rule-based extraction and normalization of temporal expressions|journal=Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation|year=2010|publisher=ACL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Llorens|first=Hector|author2=Leon Derczynski |author3=Robert Gaizauskas |author4=Estela Saquete |title=TIMEN: An Open Temporal Expression Normalisation Resource|journal=LREC|year=2012|publisher=ACL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Filannino|first=Michele|author2=Gavin Brown |author3=Goran Nenadic |title=ManTIME: Temporal identification and normalization in the TempEval-3 challenge|journal=Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation|year=2013|publisher=ACL}}&lt;/ref&gt; so creating a temporal expression recognizer from scratch is generally an undesirable duplication of effort. Instead, current approaches focus on novel subclasses of timex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brucato|first=Matteo|author2=Leon Derczynski |author3=Hector Llorens |author4=Kalina Bontcheva |author5=Christian S.

Statistical systems typically require a large amount of manually [[annotation|annotated]] training data and are usually applied to the recognition task only (although there is work done using machine learning algorithms to resolve certain ambiguities in the interpretation step).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Harvnb|Ahn|van Rantwijk|de Rijke|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Angeli|first=Gabor|author2=Christoper Manning |author3=Daniel Jurafsky |title=Parsing time: Learning to interpret time expressions|journal=Proceedings of NAACL|year=2012|page=446|publisher=ACL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Ghost in the Machine''''' is a 1967 book about [[Theoretical psychology|philosophical psychology]] by [[Arthur Koestler]]. The title is a phrase (see [[ghost in the machine]]) coined by the Oxford philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]] to describe the Cartesian dualist account of the mind–body relationship. Koestler shares with Ryle the view that the mind of a person is not an independent non-material entity, temporarily inhabiting and governing the body. The work attempts to explain humanity's self-destructive tendency in terms of individual and collective functioning, philosophy, and overarching, cyclical political–historical dynamics, peaking in the [[nuclear weapon]]s arena.

==Overview==
In an attempt to explain human violence, Koestler criticizes the dominant conceptions of psychology of his time (behaviorism) that postulate that human behaviors are subject to the selection of the fittest. For him this theory echoed the Darwinian conceptions of the evolution of species. Koestler refutes both theories. 

The book contributes also to the longstanding debate surrounding the [[mind–body problem]] and focusing in particular on [[René Descartes]]'s [[Cartesian dualism|dualism]], in the form elucidated by Ryle. Koestler's [[Materialism|materialistic]] account argues that the personal experience of [[Mind-body dualism|duality]] arises from what Koestler calls a ''[[Holon (philosophy)|holon]]''. The notion of a holon emerges from the observation that everything in the nature is both a whole and a part.  It is true for atoms who are a whole in themselves, but also a part of a molecule, of atom who could be a whole and part of cell, of cells who are both an autonomous unity and part of an organism. It is also true for human beings who have an independent life and are part of social systems. Every holon is  willing to express two contradictory tendencies  : to express himself, and to disappear in something greater.  For human, those tendencies lead to an error in the development : we create collectives units who are based on the oppression of some individuals and on  inflated ego of others. This is for Koestler an error of transcendence that is reflected in a poor integration of our reptilian brain and cognitive brain. 

A superposition of forces manifests, at each bodily holon, as the outcome of an entire hierarchy of forces—[[Ontogeny|ontogenetic]], [[habit (psychology)|habit]]ual, [[linguistic prescription|linguistic prescriptive]], and [[social science]]—operating in a continuum of independent feedback and feedforward streams of a body extended to its larger environment. The streams are fed by the life signals of each and every group member, and this fully participative medley is the spirit of life one senses as a ghost; but this spirit is just a simplified output of a complex knowledge set; it is [[Emergentism|emergent]] from the [[Complex adaptive system|complexity]] of the group's rules and strategies. He contrasts ''his'' basic approach to the mind–body problem with [[behaviorism]]'s basic approach to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;The book is vehemently critical of [[Burrhus Frederic Skinner|B. F. Skinner]]'s [[Behaviorism|Behaviorist]] theory of [[psychology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the holon of humanity down to its roots, the work explains humanity's tendency toward  self-destruction in terms of brain structure, philosophies, and its overarching, cyclical political–historical dynamics, reaching the height of its potential in the nuclear arms arena.

One of the book's central concepts is that as the human [[triune brain]] has evolved, it has retained and built upon earlier, more primitive brain structures. The head portion of the "[[ghost in the machine]]" has, as a consequence of poor, inadequate connections, a rich potential for conflict. The primitive layers can, and may, together, overpower rational logic's hold. This explains a person's [[hate]], [[anger]] and other such [[Stress (medicine)|emotional distress]].

In ''[[Janus: A Summing Up]]'' (1978) Koestler continues the theories developed in ''The Ghost in the Machine'' and further elaborates on the concept of [[holarchy]].

[[File:The unger march.jpg|thumb|''The Hunger March'' in [[China]], 2005]]

'''''The Hunger March''''' is the name of a [[happening]] and a series of [[sculpture]]s made by [[Jens Galschiøt]] in 2001.

== Concept ==

The event was inspired by the 1990 movie ''[[The March (1990 film)|The March]]'', in which a horde of starving people marches towards Europe.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

''The Hunger March'' is a reminder that, if the world's need and distress is not relieved, the desperate victims will some day be knocking on the doors of the affluent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aidoh.dk/new-struct/Happenings-and-Projects/Happenings/Hungermarch/Hungermarch.com/default.html Official website&lt;/ref&gt; To remind people of the issues the world is facing, Galschiøt created 27 sculptures of starving African kids out of bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kunstdk.dk/kunstner/jens_galschiot/tekster/cv |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302035857/http://www.kunstdk.dk/kunstner/jens_galschiot/tekster/cv |archivedate=2014-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "kids" have a sad look on their faces. The bronze is darkened to give them a sad, dark look. At the bottom of the sculpture, there is a shining new shoe, made by one of the major shoe companies that is responsible for the use of poor kids in the third world to work for a small payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labourbehindthelabel.org/campaigns/item/990-in-pictures-made-in-cambodia |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119162541/http://www.labourbehindthelabel.org/campaigns/item/990-in-pictures-made-in-cambodia |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==The first happening==

In May 2001, in the center of [[Odense]], a bronze sculpture of a 12-year-old starved black boy, with a large pair of shining new [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes, was set up so that it appeared to watch the well-fed Danes rushing by. The sculpture stood on a polished black granite pedestal, with the slogan "[[Just Do It|JUST DO IT]]" written on it.

Galschiøt stated "With this sculpture, I'll pinpoint the hypocrisy of companies who in their lifestyle commercials are linking their brands with concepts such as freedom and equality and at the same time are cynically exploiting and 
oppressing the workers who make the products."{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==''The Hunger March'' at the ASEM 4==

During the [[Asia–Europe Meeting|ASEM]] 4 summit in [[Copenhagen]] in September 2002,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aseminfoboard.org/Summits/ASEM4&lt;/ref&gt; 27 "starving boys" were placed in Copenhagen to demonstrate for social justice. The 27 sculptures were supposed to represent the starving people in the [[Third World]] countries that are influenced by the way that the summit  focuses on corporations' profit, instead of poor peoples' interests. The event was arranged in co-operation with Care-Denmark and [[The Salvation Army]]. The latter organization supplied the boys with [[Adidas]], Nike and [[Reebok]] shoes.&lt;ref&gt;http://sculptures.aidoh.dk/index.html?lang=uk&amp;&amp;view=list&amp;order=2&amp;rpp=15&amp;start=0&amp;ID=251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other happenings with ''The Hunger March''==

In the summer of 2002, a crowd of 27 starving African boys cast in copper started a tour throughout [[Denmark]] to protest against the government's cutback of development aid. 

Galschiøt launched the action in cooperation with the NGO Forum in [[Aarhus]]. Hundreds of volunteers took part in the creation of the sculptures in the artist's workshop, and subsequently in the mobilization of the boys all over the country. 

In March 2003, [[DanChurchAid]] is using the sculptures in their collection to support children who have been left orphans due to [[AIDS]].

==''The Hunger March'' today==
''The Hunger March'' has often appeared as a participant in different demonstrations in Denmark, such as the climate demonstrations. Usually the sculptures are placed on small wagons, where they appear as being a part of the marching crowd.

[[File:A throffer -- kill this person and get 7 dollars or I'll kill you.jpg|thumb|A photographic representation of the classic throffer: "Kill this man and receive £100—fail to kill him and I'll kill you.]]

In [[political philosophy]], a '''throffer''' is a proposal (also called an intervention{{refn|Offers, threats and throffers are "interventions, by others, in individuals' practical deliberations".{{sfn|Steiner|1974–75|p=36}}|group=note}}) that mixes an offer with a threat which will be carried out if the offer is not accepted. The term was first used in print by political philosopher [[Hillel Steiner]]; while other writers followed, it has not been universally adopted and it is sometimes considered synonymous with ''[[carrot and stick]]''. Though the threatening aspect of a throffer need not be obvious, or even articulated at all, an overt example is

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kill this man and receive £100; fail to kill him and I'll kill you.{{sfn|Steiner|1974–75|p=39}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Steiner differentiated offers, threats and throffers based on the preferability of compliance and noncompliance for the subject when compared to the normal course of events that would have come about were no intervention made. Steiner's account was criticised by philosopher Robert Stevens, who instead suggested that what was important in differentiating the kinds of intervention was whether performing or not performing the requested action was more or less preferable than it would have been were no intervention made. Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations of [[coercion]], and form part of the question of the possibility of [[coercive offer]]s. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats have been cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect that makes it so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.

The theoretical concerns surrounding throffers have been practically applied concerning [[workfare]] programmes. In such systems, individuals receiving [[social welfare]] have their aid decreased if they refuse the offer of work or education. [[Robert Goodin]] criticised workfare programmes which presented throffers to individuals receiving welfare, and was responded to by Daniel Shapiro, who found his objections unconvincing. Several writers have also observed that throffers presented to people convicted of crimes, particularly sex offenders, can result in more lenient sentences if they accept medical treatment. Other examples are offered by psychiatrist Julio Arboleda-Flórez, who presents concerns about throffers in [[community psychiatry]], and management expert John J. Clancey, who talks about throffers in employment.

==Origin and usage==
The term ''throffer'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''threat'' and ''offer''.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=84}} It was first used by Canadian philosopher [[Hillel Steiner]] in a 1974–75 ''[[Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society]]'' article.{{sfn|Carter|2011|p=667}} Steiner had considered a quote from the 1972 film ''[[The Godfather]]'': "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse". While the line seemed to be amusingly ironic (because a threat is being made, not an offer), Steiner was unsatisfied that the difference between an offer and a threat was merely that one promises to confer a benefit and the other a penalty.{{sfn|Steiner|1974–75|pp=37–8}} He thus coined ''throffer'' to describe the "offer" in ''The Godfather''.{{sfn|Bardhan|2005|p=39}} One prominent thinker who adopted the term was political scientist [[Michael Taylor (political scientist)|Michael Taylor]],{{sfn|Taylor|1982|p=13}} and his work on throffers has been frequently cited.{{sfn|Bardhan|2005|p=39}}{{sfn|Zimmerling|2005|p=63}}{{sfn|Goti|1999|p=206}}

''Throffer'' has not, however, been universally adopted; Michael R. Rhodes notes that there has been some controversy in the literature on whether to use ''throffer'',{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=39}} citing a number of writers, including Lawrence A. Alexander,{{sfn|Alexander|1983}} David Zimmerman{{sfn|Zimmerman|1981}} and Daniel Lyons,{{sfn|Lyons|1975}} who do not use the term.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p= 150}} Some, including political scientists Deiniol Jones{{sfn|Jones|1999|p=11}} and Andrew Rigby,{{sfn|Rigby|1991|p=72}} consider ''throffer'' to be synonymous with ''[[carrot and stick]]'', an idiom which refers to the way a donkey is offered a carrot to encourage compliance, while noncompliance is punished with a stick.{{sfn|Ayto|2010|p=56}} Other writers, while electing to use the word, consider it a poor one. For instance, literary scholar Daniel Shore calls it "a somewhat unfortunate term", while using it in his analysis of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Regained]]''.{{sfn|Shore|2012|p=161}}

==Definitions==
In addition to Steiner's original account of throffers, other authors have suggested definitions and ideas on how to differentiate throffers from threats and offers.

===Steiner's account===
In the article that introduces the term ''throffer'', Steiner considers the difference between interventions in the form of a threat and those in the form of an offer. He concludes that the distinction is based on how the consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ for the subject of the intervention when compared with "the norm". Steiner observes that a concept of "normalcy" is presupposed in literature on coercion, as changes in well-being for the subject of an intervention are not merely relative, but absolute; any possibility of an absolute change requires a standard, and this standard is "the description of the normal and preducable course of events, that is, the course of events which would confront the recipient of the intervention were the intervention not to occur".{{sfn|Steiner|1974–75|pp=38–9}}

For an offer, such as "you may use my car whenever you like", the consequence of compliance "represents a situation which is preferred to the norm". Noncompliance, that is, not taking up the offer of the use of the car, is identical to the norm, and so neither more nor less preferable. Threats, on the other hand, are characterised by compliance that leads to an outcome less preferable to the norm, with noncompliance leading to an outcome less desirable still. For instance, if someone is threatened with "[[Highwayman|your money or your life]]", compliance would lead to them losing their money, while noncompliance would lead to them losing their life. Both are less desirable than the norm (that is, not being threatened at all), but, for the subject of the threat, losing money is more desirable than being killed. A throffer is a third kind of intervention. It differs from both a threat and an offer, as compliance is preferable to the norm, while noncompliance is less preferable than the norm.{{sfn|Steiner|1974–75|p=39}}

For Steiner, all of offers, threats and throffers affect the [[Practical reason|practical deliberations]] of their recipient in the same way. What is significant for the subject of the intervention is not the extent to which the consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in desirability from the norm, but the extent to which they differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.{{sfn|Steiner|1974–75|pp=40–1}}

===Stevens's account===
Responding to Steiner, Robert Stevens provides examples of what he categorises variously as offers, threats and throffers that fail to meet Steiner's definitions. He gives an example of an intervention he considers a throffer, as opposed to a threat, but in which both compliance and noncompliance are less preferable to the norm. The example is that of someone who makes the demand "either you accept my offer of a handful of beans for your cow, or I kill you". For the subject, keeping the cow is preferred to both compliance and noncompliance with the throffer. Using this and other examples, Stevens argued that Steiner's account of differentiating the three kinds of interventions is incorrect.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=84}}

In its place, Stevens suggests that determining whether an intervention is a throffer depends not on the desirability of compliance and noncompliance when compared to the norm, but on the desirability of the actions entailed in compliance or noncompliance when compared with what their desirability would have been were no intervention made. He proposes that a throffer is made if P attempts to encourage Q to do A by increasing "the desirability to Q of Q doing A relative to what it would have been if P made no proposal and decrease the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A relative to what it would have been if P made no proposal". An offer, by contrast, increases the desirability to Q of Q doing A compared to how it would have been without P's intervention, leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A as it would have been. A threat decreases the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A compared to what it would have been without P's intervention, while leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing A as it would have been.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=85}}

===Kristjánsson's account===
Political philosopher [[Kristján Kristjánsson]] differentiates threats and offers by explaining that the former is a proposal that creates an obstacle, while the latter is one kind of proposal (another example being a request) that does not.{{sfn|Kristjánsson|1992|p=67}} He also draws a distinction between ''tentative proposals'' and ''final proposals'', which he feels earlier authors ignored.{{sfn|Kristjánsson|1992|p=68}} A tentative proposal does not logically create any kind of obstacle for its subject, and, as such, is an offer. For instance, "if you fetch the paper for me, you'll get candy" is a tentative proposal, as it does not logically entail that a failure to fetch the paper will result in no candy; it is possible that candy can be acquired by another route. In other words, [[Material conditional|if]] the subject fetches the paper, then they get candy.{{sfn|Kristjánsson|1992|p=66}} By contrast, if the proposal was a final proposal, it would take the form of "[[if and only if]] you fetch the paper for me, you'll get candy". This entails that candy can only be acquired if the subject fetches the paper, and no other way. For Kristjánsson, this kind of final proposal constitutes a throffer. There is an offer to fetch the paper ("if"), and a threat that candy can only be acquired through this route ("only if"). As such, an obstacle has been placed on the route of acquiring candy.{{sfn|Kristjánsson|1992|p=67}}

Previous authors (Kristjánsson cites [[Joel Feinberg]], [[Alan Wertheimer]] and [[Robert Nozick]]) provided moral and statistical analyses of various [[thought experiments]] to determine whether the proposals they involve are threats or offers. On Kristjánsson's account, by contrast, all of the thought experiments considered are throffers. Instead, he argues, the previous thinkers' analyses attempted to differentiate offers that limit freedom from those that do not. They conflate two tasks, that of differentiating threats and offers and that of differentiating freedom-restricting threats from non-freedom-restricting threats.{{sfn|Kristjánsson|1992|pp=68–9}} He concludes that the thinkers' methods are also inadequate for determining the difference between freedom-restricting and non-freedom-restricting threats, for which a test of [[moral responsibility]] would be required.{{sfn|Kristjánsson|1992|p=69}}

===Rhodes's account===
Political philosopher and legal theorist Michael R. Rhodes offers an account of threats, offers and throffers based upon the perception of the subject of the proposal (and, in the case of proposals from agents as opposed to nature,{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=39}} the perception of the agent making the proposal.){{sfn|Rhodes|2000|pp=37, 66}} Rhodes presents seven different [[motivation]]al-want-structures, that is, seven reasons why ''P'' may want to do what leads to ''B'':

#''W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' (intrinsic-attainment-want): "''B'' is wanted in and of itself; ''B'' is perceived by ''P'' with immediate approbation; ''B'' is valued in and of itself by ''P''."
#''W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' (extrinsic-attainment-want): "''B'' is perceived by ''P'' as a means to ''E'' where ''E'' is an intrinsic-attainment-want."
#''W&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' (compound-attainment-want): "''B'' is both an intrinsic-attainment-want and an extrinsic-attainment-want; B is both ''W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''."
#''W&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' (extrinsic-avoidance-want): "''B'' is perceived by ''P'' as a means of avoiding ''F'' where ''F'' is perceived by ''P'' with immediate disapprobation (''F'' is feared by, or ''F'' is threatening to, ''P'')."
#''W&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'' (complex-want-type-A): "''B'' is both W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;."
#''W&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'' (complex-want-type-B): "''B'' is both W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;."
#''W&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;'' (complex-want-type-C): "''B'' is both W&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;."{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=31}}

Proposals that motivate ''P'' to act because of ''W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''W&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' represent offers. Those that do so because of ''W&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' represent threats.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=39}} Rhodes notes that offers and threats are asymmetrical: while an offer requires only a slight approbation, a high degree of disapprobation is required before a proposal can be called a threat. The disapprobation must be high enough to provoke the "perception of a threat and correlative sense of fear".{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=37}} Rhodes labels as ''throffers'' those proposals that motivate ''P'' to act because of ''W&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''W&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''W&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;'',{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|pp=49–55}} but notes that the name is not universally used.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=39}}

For Rhodes, throffers can not merely be biconditional proposals. If ''Q'' proposes that ''P'' pay $10,000 so that ''Q'' withholds information that would lead to ''P''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s arrest, then despite the fact that the proposal is biconditional (that is, ''P'' may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for ''P'' independent of ''Q''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s proposal.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|pp=42–3}} ''P''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s paying of ''Q'' does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=44}} The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal).{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|pp=44, 57}} Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain ''neutral proposals'', and so not be throffers.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=44}} The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=56}} Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a threat and neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it is always going to be difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|pp=63–4}}

==Throffers and coercion==
Consideration of throffers forms part of the wider question of [[coercion]] and, specifically, the possibility of a [[coercive offer]].{{sfn|Anderson|2011}} Determining whether throffers are coercive, and, if so, to what extent, is difficult.{{sfn|Shapiro|2007|p=217}} The traditional assumption is that offers cannot be coercive, only threats can, but throffers can challenge this.{{sfn|Anderson|2011}}{{sfn|Kleinig|2009|p=15}} The threatening aspect of a throffer need not be explicit, as it was in Steiner's examples. Instead, a throffer may take the form of an offer, but carry an implied threat.{{sfn|Burnell|2008|p=423}} Philosopher [[John Kleinig]] sees a throffer as an example of an occasion when an offer alone may be considered coercive. Another example of a coercive offer may be when the situation in which the offer is made is already unacceptable; for instance, if a factory owner takes advantage of a poor economic environment to offer workers an unfair wage.{{sfn|Kleinig|2009|pp=15–6}} For Jonathan Riley, a liberal society has a duty to protect its citizens from coercion, whether that coercion comes from a threat, offer, throffer or some other source. "If other persons ... attempt to frustrate the right-holder's wants, then a liberal society must take steps to prevent this, by law if necessary. All exercises of power by others to frustrate the relevant individual or group preferences constitute unwarranted 'interference' with liberty in purely private matters."{{sfn|Riley|1989|p=133}}

Ian Hunt concurs that offers may be considered coercive, and claims that, whatever form the interventions take, they may be considered coercive "when they are socially corrigible influences over action that diminish an agent's freedom overall". He accepts that a possible objection to his claim is that at least some coercive offers do seemingly increase the freedom of their recipients. For instance, in the thought experiment of the [[lecherous millionaire]], a millionaire offers a mother money for treatment for her son's life-threatening illness in exchange for her becoming the millionaire's mistress. [[Joel Feinberg]] considers the offer coercive, but in offering a possibility of treatment, the millionaire has increased the options available to the mother, and thus her freedom.{{sfn|Hunt|2001|pp=141–2}} For Hunt, Feinberg "overlooks the fact that the millionaire's offer opens the option of [the mother] saving her child on condition that the option of not being [the millionaire's] mistress is closed". Hunt does not see the mother as more free; "while it is clear that she has a greater capacity to pursue her interests as a parent once the offer has been made, and to that extent can be regarded as freer, it is clear also that her capacity to pursue her sexual interests may have been diminished."{{sfn|Hunt|2001|pp=142}} Every coercive proposal, whether threat, offer or throffer, according to Hunt, contains a simultaneous loss and gain of freedom.{{sfn|Hunt|2001|pp=142}} Kristjánsson, by contrast, argues that Feinberg's account of "coercive offers" is flawed because these are not offers at all, but throffers.{{sfn|Kristjánsson|1992|p=67}}

[[Peter Westen]] and [[H. L. A. Hart]] argue that throffers are not always coercive, and, when they are, it is specifically the threat that makes them so. For a throffer to be coercive, they claim, the threat must meet three further conditions; firstly, the person making the throffer "must be intentionally bringing the threat to bear on X in order that X do something, Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;", secondly, the person making the throffer must know that "X would not otherwise do or wish to be constrained to do" Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and, thirdly, the threat part of the throffer must render "X's option of doing Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; more eligible in X's eyes than it would otherwise be".{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=100}} As such, for the authors, there is the possibility of non-coercive throffers. The pair present three possible examples. Firstly, when the threat aspect of the throffer is a joke; secondly, when the offer aspect is already so desirable to the subject that the threat does not affect their decision-making; or, thirdly, when the subject mistakenly believes the threat immaterial because of the attractiveness of the offer.{{sfn|Hart|Westen|1985|p=582}} Rhodes similarly concludes that if a throffer is coercive, it is because of the threatening aspect.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=69}} For him, the question is "whether one regards the threat component of a throffer as both a necessary and sufficient condition of the performance of a behaviour".{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=99}} He argues that if the offer without the threat would have been enough for the agent subject to the proposal to act, then the proposal is not coercive. However, if both offer and threat aspects of the throffer are motivating factors, then it is tricky to determine whether the agent subject to the proposal was coerced. He suggests that differentiating between "pure coercion" and "partial coercion" may help solve this problem,{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=69}} and that the question of coercion in these cases is one of degree.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=100}}

==Practical examples==
The conceptual issues around throffers are practically applied in studies in a number of areas, but the term is also used outside of academia. For instance, it has seen use in British policing and in British courts.{{sfn|Cullen|Newell|1999|p=63}}

===Workfare===
Conceptual thinking about throffers is practically applied in considerations of conditional aid, such as is used in [[workfare]] systems. For philosopher and political theorist Gertrude Ezorsky, the denial of [[welfare]] when subjects refuse work is the epitome of a throffer.{{sfn|Ezorsky|2011|pp=36–7}} Conditional welfare is also labelled a throffer by political philosopher [[Robert Goodin]].{{sfn|Goodin|1998|p=180}} In the words of Daniel Shapiro, also a political philosopher, the offer aspect of workfare is seen in the "benefits one receives if one learns new skills, gets a job, alters destructive behaviors and the like", while the threat aspect is executed with "the elimination or reduction of aid, if the person does not, after a certain period of time, accept the offer".{{sfn|Shapiro|2007|p=217}} For Goodin, the moral questionability of the threat aspect of a throffer is generally mitigated by the attractiveness of the offer aspect. In this way, workfare can represent a "genuine" throffer, but only when a person receiving welfare payments does not need the payments to survive, and so possesses a genuine choice as to whether to accept the throffer. When, however, an individual would be unable to survive if he or she stopped receiving welfare payments, there is no genuine choice; the individual is, for Goodin, unable to refuse the throffer. This cancels out the morally mitigating factor usually possessed by a throffer. This is presented as an argument against workfare, and Goodin anticipates that advocates would respond [[paternalism|paternalistically]] by claiming that, regardless of issues of freedom, the individual in question would benefit from taking part in the work or education offered.{{sfn|Goodin|1998|pp=181–3}}

Shapiro responds to Goodin's argument by challenging his factual assumption that individuals would starve if they refused the workfare throffer. In state-sponsored (see [[welfare state]]) workfare systems, he claims, only monetary assistance is eliminated by a refusal to accept the throffer, while in private systems (that is, non-state charities or organisations offering conditional aid), other groups than the one operating a workfare system exist. In either system, recipients of welfare may also turn to family and friends for help. For these reasons, he does not consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin believes it is. A second (and, Shapiro claims, more important) objection is also presented. State welfare without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on welfare payments take responsibility for their lives. If a person who works stops working, Shapiro observes, then they will typically find their economic situation worsened. Unconditional state welfare does not reflect this, and instead reflects the unusual position of the person who would be no worse off if they refused to work. As unconditional welfare does not mirror the situation of ordinary workers, it is unable to determine whether or not people are willing to take responsibility for their lives.{{sfn|Shapiro|2007|pp=217–8}}

For Ivar Lødemel and Heather Trickey, editors of ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;An Offer You Can't Refuse': Workfare in International Perspective'', workfare programmes' reliance on compulsion makes them throffers. Citing the Danish model as a particular example, the pair argue that workfare involves the use of compulsory offers; while the work or education is presented as an offer, because recipients of welfare are dependent upon the help they would lose if they refuse the offer, they effectively have no choice. The compulsive aspect reveals that at least some recipients of welfare, in the eyes of policy makers, require coercion before they will accept offers of work. Neither the chance of paid work nor participation in labour schemes are, alone, enough to encourage some to freely accept the offers they receive. Such compulsion serves to reintegrate people into the labour market, and serves as a kind of "new paternalism".{{sfn|Lødemel|Trickey|2001|pp=7–8}} The authors are concerned about this compulsion, and present several arguments against it which are possible or have been utilised in the literature: Firstly, it impacts the rights of those against whom it is used. This may make it objectionable in and of itself, or it may result in undesirable outcomes. Secondly, it can be argued that benefits must be unconditional in order to act as a genuine [[Social safety net|safety net]]. Thirdly, compulsion undermines consumer feedback, and so no differentiation can be made between good and poor programmes presented to those receiving welfare. Fourthly, such coercion may contribute to a culture of resistance among those receiving welfare.{{sfn|Lødemel|Trickey|2001|pp=7–8}}

===Prisoners and mental health===
Forensic psychologist Eric Cullen and prison governor Tim Newell claim that prisoners face a throffer once they are told that they must acknowledge their guilt before they are offered [[parole]]{{sfn|Cullen|Newell|1999|p=55}} or moved to an [[open prison]]. Cullen and Newell cite the example of a prisoner who falsely admitted guilt to move to an open prison; once there, however, he felt he could no longer lie about his guilt, and confessed to the prison's governor. He was subsequently transferred back to a maximum security prison.{{sfn|Cullen|Newell|1999|p=63}} In the case of [[sex offenders]], a throffer is presented when they are offered release if they take up treatment, but are threatened with extended sentences if they do not. Cullen and Newell are concerned about the predicament that these throffers present to prisoners, including those found innocent on appeal.{{sfn|Cullen|Newell|1999|pp=65–6}} Concerns surrounding throffers proposed to convicted sex offenders have also been discussed in print by Alex Alexandrowicz, himself wrongly imprisoned, and criminologist [[David Wilson (criminologist)|David Wilson]].{{sfn|Alexandrowicz|Wilson|1999|pp=144–5}} The latter observed the difficulties for those innocent people wrongly imprisoned who are faced with the throffer of having their sentence shortened if they "acknowledge their guilt", but noted that, as perspectives of prisoners were rarely considered, the problem is usually not visible.{{sfn|Wilson|2001}}

Likewise, therapeutic treatment of non-criminals with [[mental health]] problems can be considered in terms of throffers. In [[community psychiatry]], patients with mental health problems will sometimes be presented with the provision of social services, such as financial or housing aid, in exchange for changing their lifestyle and reporting for the administration of medicines. Psychiatrist Julio Arboleda-Flórez considers these throffers a form of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]], and worries that they

&lt;blockquote&gt;
have multiple implications in regard to coercive mechanisms from implicit curtailments of freedom to ascription of vulnerability. The former would include threats to personal autonomy, instilling fear in regard to a potential loss of freedom, an increase of dependency with mistrust of one's own capabilities to manage the business of living and, hence, an increase of feelings and attitudes of helplessness. The ascription of vulnerability overrides the principle of equality between the partners, constitutes and invasion of privacy and impacts on the positive rights of individuals.{{sfn|Arboleda-Flórez|2011|p=90}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Business===
According to [[management]] researcher John J. Clancey, [[scientific management]] can involve the use of throffers. While [[piecework]] had been utilised since the [[Middle Ages]], [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] blended [[Rationalization (economics)|rationalised]] management with piecework, to create a new system. Productivity processes were standardised, after which point managers were able to present a throffer to workers: higher pay was offered if they were able to exceed the standard, while lower pay was threatened for any who did not meet expectations.{{sfn|Clancey|1998|p=145}}

The [[United Arab Emirates]] is a middle-eastern country, located at the end of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] on the Persian Gulf, consisting of seven emirates known as [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Dubai]], [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]], [[Ajman]], [[Umm al-Quwain]], [[Ras al-Khaimah]] and [[Fujairah]]. Each emirate is governed by an emir who jointly forms the Federal Supreme Council (FSC). The Federal System of government includes the Supreme Council, Cabinet, Council of Ministers, parliamentary body, Federal National Council and independent judiciary. The Federal Supreme Council is the highest constitutional authority that has legislative and executive powers with the ability to ratify federal laws, decrees, and plans general policies. Its jurisdictions are derived from French, Roman, Egyptian and Islamic law.

==Judicial branch of the government==
There are three main branches of the court structure: civil, criminal, and sharia or Islamic (1) (the precepts are set forth in the Quranic verses and example set by the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the Sunnah). (2) Sharia or Islamic courts work alongside the civil and criminal courts. The responsibilities include civil matters between Muslims. Non-Muslims will not appear before a Sharia court in any matter due to the differences in religious beliefs. (3) Sharia or Islamic courts have the exclusive jurisdiction over family disputes divorce, inheritance, child custody, child abuse, and guardianship of minors. (3) However, at the federal level the Sharia court may hear appeals of criminal cases including rape, robbery, and driving under the influence of alcohol. (3)
Dubai is its own sovereign nation with its own federal judicial system with separate court systems that are not subjected to the federal Supreme Court. Dubai's court structure consists of:

# Court of First Instances- hears all claims ranging from commercial matters, debt recovery to maritime disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al Hanaee|title=Commitment of the maritime carrier|url=http://www.alhanaee.com/our-team/|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Court of Appeal- parties have the right to appeal on factual or legal grounds within thirty days from the judgment date.
# Court of Cessations- (highest court in Dubai) composed of five judges and all judgments are finals and not subject to appeal; only hear disputes on matters of the law and can act as an appellate court with respect to decisions made from lower courts. Also, can supervise lower courts ensuring the law is interpreted accurately. (3)

==Legal process==
Criminal actions commence with a police investigation which is transferred to the prosecutor's office within 48 hours of filing a complaint. The prosecutor will then hear and document statements from witnesses to determine if charges will be pressed or dropped, which must be completed 14 days from receiving the case from the police. Once the prosecutor has decided if charges will be pressed, the parties can proceed in hiring an attorney. All attorneys must be licensed to practice law and must be approved by an official deed notarized by a notary public to try the case. (3)

===Trial procedures===
Under the United Arab Emirates constitution all defendants are innocent until proven guilty. All trials are public except for national security cases trials that the honoring judge can rule to be conducted in privates if any evidence, testimonies or results are detrimental to societal morality. (4) Being that majority of the trials are public the emirs decided on having no juries in place in the courtroom. Also, all proceedings are delivered in the native language. Except the sentencing portion, translators are available for those who are not fluent in Arabic. For all indignant persons who are charged with felonies punishable by 3–15 years with no attorney, may have counsel provided for them upon the governments discretion. (4) Unlike the United States court system, the UAE prosecutors and defense lawyers have the ability to withhold any investigation from each other involving the case. (4) After, deliberations have been made of indictments, detainees may be released on bail informally. Authorities will accept a cash deposit, passport or an unsecured personal guarantee statement signed by a third party as a form of payment. Diya or blood money also qualifies as debt to a crime committed.

==Diya or blood money==
If one causes the death or injury of another person accidentally or intentionally he or she must pay the victim's family, what is known as [[diyya|diya]] or "blood money".  It is a means of compensation to the loss or harm for the loved ones. The payment of diya protects the rights of the family in the event of further threats from any accomplices or known associates of the defendant.  Diya is only payable if the defendant is found guilty under the criminal procedure or legally responsible for committing the crime. (5) However, if the defendant is found defending themselves, family, or property, diya will not be paid. Males rate of diya is Dh 200,000 (approx. US$54,450) and Dh 100,000 (approx. US$27,225) for females regardless of religion or nationality. (5)

==Free trial and free press==
Section 2 A of the United Arab Emirates constitution provides freedom of speech and press. However, the law prohibits criticism and slander of public officials that may create or encourage social uproar. (4) Journalists undergo strict boundaries implemented from the government. A variety of information can be published and distributed without the content being harmful or insulting to others. All sources must be reliable and will not be published until a full investigation has been performed to phish out any fabricated information. (6) Writers have the full right to document and publish info gathered from the courtroom due to trials being open to the public (judges can ask for privacy). Writers are prohibited from publishing the names of the accused, victims, or witnesses. (6)

==Women and the law==
Women in the UAE have progressed through the years with rights that they haven’t had prior to the declaration. However, many are concerned with how women are treated in this country. In marriage, the women are bound by a marital contract that clearly states that she is to abide by her husband, take care of home and the children. If the women disobeys or neglect her duties as a wife, by law the husband has the right to use physical means including violence to correct her disdaining acts. (4) Nevertheless, some domestic abuse cases can be filed as an assault without the intent to kill that is punishable by 10 years in prison of death results, 7 years for permanent disability, or 1 year for temporary injury. (4) Rape in the UAE is not tolerated and is punishable by immediate death. However, many women do not report being raped because they could be accused of adultery which results in flogging or death by stoning and brings shame to the family. (7) Divorce is rare in the UAE due to the stipulations that derive from it. Article 110 of the Personal Status Code states, women can request to be divorced with the exception that she surrenders all of her finances; otherwise known as the "khul" divorce procedure. (7) If the divorce is processed, the custody of the children is determined. Women are considered to be physical guardians and only have the right to custody up to the age of 13 for girls and 10 for boys. Once that age has been reached the Sharia courts can reassess for further custody. If the woman decides to remarry she automatically forfeits her rights of custody for her children from the previous marriage. (7)

==Juveniles and the law==
Like the women if minors disobey or act out, the male has the right to utilize corporal punishment. Criminal responsibility begins at age seven. (8) Sharia principles permit corporal punishment of young children including flogging, amputation, and retaliation similar to the pain reflected on the victim. Article 8 of the Juvenile Delinquent and Vagrant Act states, that if a juvenile is over the age of 16 and commits an offence, under the Penal Code at the judge's discretion they may sentence them to the measures provided in crime, instead of the prescribed penalty. (9) Article 9 states, "a juvenile may not be condemned to capital punishment". Juveniles who reach 16 are to be punished under the penal code substituting a sentence of detention not to exceed 10 years. (10)

==Customs and culture==
It is apparent that the UAE has applied firm penalties in accordance with maintaining the country's respect. Its vast success from new contemporary ideas has inspired other countries to engage in the innovations. With respect to UAE's religion, any showing of body parts such as buttocks, leg breast is deemed indecent and is strictly prohibited. Punishment for indecent exposure if jail or deportation. The body and romantic relationship is sacred and affection should be kept behind closed doors. Public affection is not allowed regardless of relationship status. Kissing and embracing of significant others is offensive and will be reported; holding hands is only affection acceptable.

==Crimes punishable by death==
The death penalty's purpose is to not only punish, but to rehabilitate criminals{{Clarify|date=June 2014}} and if possible prevent others from committing the same crime. (13) The main goal of the United Arab Emirates is to protect the lives, religion, parentage, intellect, and property of its citizens through rules and regulations that are strictly enforced with no tolerance. There are five crimes that the death penalty is automatically administered for: adultery, rape, armed highway robbery, murder, and apostasy.

In the Middle East, men are lawfully allowed to marry up to four women provided that he equally divides his time and money to take care of the family needs. (13) If the wives believe they haven’t received their share of his time or expenses than they have the right to ask for a divorce, due to the lack of marital support. The concept of having multiple spouses is to discourage men from committing adultery, having any sexual intercourse outside of marriage. Basically to avoid any bastard children, this in turn can create confusion within the family. The child will not be considered to have a father because his mother was not legally married to him and places the child in a difficult position, psychologically. Adultery is forbidden in order to uphold is mission to protect the livelihood of its citizens.

Rape, is extremely unacceptable in this country. The age of sexual maturity is fourteen. (13) Both women and men can be considered the culprit. To be sentenced to the death penalty full intercourse must have occurred. (13) In contrast, it is difficult to prove based on the circumstances of how women are treated in the law. If a women confesses that she has been attack without consent she must immediately alert local authorities in order to assess the crime, if not she will be deemed as agreeing and being full fledge on in non-marital sex and sentenced to death. In addition, if a women is pregnant at the time of her sentencing she is allowed to give birth and suckle the child for two years before her death is complete. (13)
Armed highway robbery is the impression of taking money from another under the threat of force of arms, thus imposing physical or financial assault. (13) Theft (Al Haraboh) occurs when an individual or group of people prey on others in attempt to take their valuables or property. Citizens have the natural right to obtain anything they have without the threat of someone without authority revoking it from them. The perpetrator who breaks that natural right is going against the ideologies of the country, which no pardon can be given.

Under Book 1, Article 1 of the Penal Code retributive penalties can apply under the Sharia law. The United Arab Emirates courts follow the Maliki School of Sunni Islam for the use of authority and interpretation from other schools to pronounce the sentences for murder cases. Islamic law defines any sane person who intentionally kills another with a weapon, is a sinner deserving perdition according to the Quran and the murderer is subject to retaliation. (11) Aggravated Murder, in the case of "deliberate design" or premeditated purpose is also punishable by death. (11) Unlawful killing such as: killing by fire, drowning in water, throwing from a high place, crushing by pushing down a wall, strangling, prevention of food and water, or exposing to a predatory animal are all likely to cause death, in the event death will be the punishment. (13) Homicides of public employees including ministries, government authorities, and members of the armed forces are considered an attack on the country itself and will be immediately prosecuted.

Apostasy or Al Reda is one who turns away from the Islamic religion, whether he or she embraces another religion or says they disbelieve after once believing. This crime is characterized and an intentional act unless under the individual is not at their sound capacity. (13) Any Muslim that denies one of the holy books, the prophets, or rejects any methods of the Islamic worship including prayer, paying Zakat (obligatory payment made annually under Islamic law on certain kinds of property and used for charitable and religious purpose), or fasting will be condemned to life for not abiding by the ordinances set in place for the country. (13) Moreover, if the person proclaims that they are in disbelief but is unaware of their statements they will be questioned once they regain their normal state of mind. Once they have gain clarity of themselves and deny any statements made in that stage than they will not be held liable for their action or comments. (13)

Other crimes that can be accountable for readmission for the death penalty are perjury/calumny, inciting suicide, drinking (the use of drug-induced state of mind to incite a person to commit an offense; drinking and driving results in jail, fines, and deportation, (12) arson, kidnapping, drug trafficking (severe crime with a zero tolerance policy toward illegal drug use) (12), and human trafficking.

All of these crimes have been committed but are infrequent due to the punishment of death. During the process of execution a deputy of the ministry, doctor, convict's lawyer and one of the member of the public prosecution are present. Relatives of the criminal are able to visit that day prior to the implementation of the sentence.

A '''Waste broker''' is someone within the waste industry who acts as [[intermediary|middle man]] between other waste industry parties. They are required to be registered with the [[Environment Agency]].

==Waste Broker==
The client would typically have some [[rubbish]] (trash) to take away, and rather than ring round a few contractors in the area they ring the Waste Broker, and give them all the details of what they want. This Broker person or organisation will have a list of those contractors in the area, and it is they who will do the ringing round or emailing, to see who is available to do the client's pickup.

==Trade Broker (a type of Waste Broker)==
The client might be a producer of recycled materials, and want to sell them. They will contact a Trade Broker who performs a similar function.
Usually the Waste Broker is local or at most national, but the Trade Broker could be arranging shipments between countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4134">'''Zindel V. Segal''' (born 1956 in [[Lutsk]], Ukraine)&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.provost.utoronto.ca/awards/Distinguished_Professors/Zindel_Segal.htm|title= Zindel Segal|publisher= Provost.utoronto.ca|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[cognitive psychologist]], a specialist on [[clinical depression|depression]] and one of the founders of [[Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy]] (MBCT).

A professor of psychology at University of Toronto, Segal combines mindfulness with conventional [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], which teaches patients to develop a different relationship to sadness or unhappiness by observing and without judgment. Presently he is Distinguished Professor of Psychology in Mood Disorders in the Department of Psychology at the [[University of Toronto Scarborough]]. He is also the Director of Clinical Training in the Graduate Department of Clinical Psychological Science.

==Career==
When he first started working on the [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]] (MBCT) project, he was studying how depression alters a person's [[self-image]]. His research included measuring a depressed patient's self-image by calculating the time it took her to react to positive or negative information about her. David Kupfer, who was head of the [[Psychobiology]] of Depression Research Network of the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]], asked Segal to create a "maintenance" version of [[cognitive therapy]] which could be used to fight depression relapse after one had recovered from an acute episode.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Teasdale, Williams, 2013, p.19-20&lt;/ref&gt; This need for a new therapy became Zindel Segal's new passion. He is the author of ''Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression''.

His research has helped to characterize psychological markers of relapse vulnerability to affective disorder. Among the books he has authored are Interpersonal Process in Cognitive Therapy, Cognitive Vulnerability to Depression, and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression: A new approach for preventing relapse. A Founding Fellow of the Academy of Cognitive Therapy, he was awarded the Douglas Utting Prize for significant contributions to the understanding and treatment of depression and the Hope Award by the Mood Disorders Association of Ontario.  He continues to advocate for the relevance of mindfulness-based clinical care in psychiatry and mental health.
