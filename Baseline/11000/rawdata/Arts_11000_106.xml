'''''"Master Harold"...and the boys''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] by [[Athol Fugard]].  Set in 1950, it was first produced at the [[Yale Repertory Theatre]] in March 1982 and made its premiere on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on 4 May at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]],&lt;ref name=Rich&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rich|first1=Frank|authorlink1=Frank Rich|title=STAGE: 'MASTER HAROLD,' FUGARD'S DRAMA ON ORIGIN OF HATE|url=https://www.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9504E6DC1738F936A35756C0A964948260|accessdate=13 September 2015|agency=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 5, 1982|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it ran for 344 performances. The play takes place in [[South Africa]] during [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] era, and depicts how institutionalized [[racism]], bigotry or hatred can become absorbed by those who live under it. It is said to be a semi-autobiographical play, as Athol Fugard's birth name was Harold and his boyhood was very similar to Hally's, including his father being disabled, and his mother running a tea shop to support the family. His relationship with his family's servants was also similar to Hally's, as he sometimes considered them his friends, but other times treated them like subservient help, insisting that he be called "Master Harold", and once spitting in the face of one he had been close to.

The play was initially [[censorship|banned]] from production in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Master Harold...and the Boys | url=http://www.colonytheatre.org/news/PRMasterHarold.html | publisher=The Colony Theatre Company | date=26 September 2007 | accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of Fugard's plays to premiere outside of South Africa.&lt;ref name=Rich/&gt;

==Plot==
The play recounts the long, rainy afternoon that Hally ("Master Harold") spends with Sam and Willie, two middle-aged African servants of his parent's household, in a tea shop owned by Hally's mother.  Sam and Willie have cared for seventeen year old Hally his whole life.

At the start of the play Sam and Willie are practicing [[ballroom dancing|ballroom]] steps in preparation for a major competition, while maintaining the tea shop. Business is slow due to the rain. Sam is quickly revealed as being the more worldly of the two.  When Willie, in broken English, describes his ballroom partner and girlfriend as lacking enthusiasm, Sam correctly diagnoses the problem: Willie beats her if she doesn't know the steps.

Hally then arrives home from school, and cheerfully asks if the two are ready for the competition.  Sam is the unacknowledged yet de facto mentor to the boy since childhood, and has always treated Hally as his nephew/ward.  Sam hopes to skillfully guide Hally through the difficult passage from childhood into manhood.  And hopefully thereby, takes up those values and viewpoints of an adult; and a man, that Sam, has over the years lain down; and, that all men try to leave as their legacy of shepherding an adolescent boy into manhood.  Willie, for his part, has always played the "loyal black"; who has always called the white Afrikaner boy (now young man) "Master Harold"; As if, as a man of forty-five, he was addressing a superior; even when Hally was six.

The conversation between the three moves from Hally's school-work, to an intellectual discussion on "A Man of Magnitude", where they mention various historical figures of the time and their contribution to society, to flashbacks of Hally, Sam and Willie when they lived in a Boarding House. Hally warmly remembers the simple act of flying a kite Sam had made for him out of junk; we later learn that Sam made it to cheer Hally up after he was embarrassed greatly by his father's public and continuing drunkenness. Conversation then turns to Hally's 500-word [[English studies|English]] composition.  The play reaches an emotional apex as the beauty of the [[ballroom dancing]] floor ("a world without collisions") is used as a transcendent [[metaphor]] for life.

Almost immediately despair returns: Sam had early on mentioned why Hally's mother is not present; the hospital had called about his father, who has been there receiving treatment for complications from a leg he lost in [[World War II]], to discharge him, and she had left to bring him home. However, Hally, indicating that his father had been in considerable pain the previous day, insisted that his father wasn't well enough to be discharged, and that the call must've been about a bad turn, rather than a discharge notice. A call from Hally's mother at the hospital confirms that Hally's father, is manipulating the hospital into discharging him, although he is indeed, not feeling any better than before, so it's still unofficial, and Hally remains hopeful that the discharge won't happen. A second call from Hally's mother later reveals that the discharge is official, and Hally's father is now home.

Hally is distraught about this news, since his father, who in addition to being crippled, is revealed to be a tyrannical alcoholic, and his being home will make home life unbearable with his drinking, fighting, and need for constant treatment, which includes demeaning tasks of having to massage his stump, and empty chamber pots of urine. Hally vents to his two black friends years of anger, and pain, viciously mocking his father and his condition. But when Sam chastises him for doing so, Hally, although ashamed of himself, turns on him, unleashing vicarious racism, that he learned from his father, creating possibly permanent rifts in his relationship with both Sam and Willie. For the first time, apart from hints throughout the play, Hally begins explicitly to treat Sam and Willie as subservient help rather than as friends or playmates, insisting that Sam call him "Master Harold" and spitting on him, among other things. Sam is hurt and angry and both he and Willie are just short of attacking Hally, but they both understand that Hally is really causing himself the most pain.

There is a glimmer of hope for reconciliation at the end, when Sam addresses Hally by his nickname again and asks to start over the next day, harkening back to the simple days of the kite. Hally, horrified about what he's done, is barely able to face Sam, responding without looking up "It's still raining, Sam. You can't fly kites on rainy days, remember," then asks Willie to lock up the tea shop, and walks out into the rain, as Sam mentions that the bench Hally sat on as he flew the kite said "Whites Only" but Hally was too excited to notice it, and that he can (figuratively) leave it at any time. The play ends while Sam and Willie console each other by ballroom dancing together.

==Critical reception==
John Simon, writing for [[New York Magazine]], was measured in his review:{{quote |text=Fugard has now perfected his way of writing plays about the tragedy of apartheid; he avoids the spectacular horrors and concentrates instead on the subtle corrosion and corruption, on the crumbling of the spirit for which the cure would be heroic action that may not be forthcoming, which the blacks try to assuage with the salve of dreams, the whites with the cautery of oppression.|author=[[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]], "'Two Harolds and no Medea." (May 17, 1982)&lt;ref name=Simon&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=John|title=Two Harolds and no Medea|journal=New York Magazine|date=17 May 1982|volume=15|issue=20|page=76|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=m-cCAAAAMBAJ|publisher=New York Media, LLC|language=English|issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Frank Rich]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the performance at the original Broadway premiere: {{quote |text=There may be two or three living playwrights in the world who can write as well as Athol Fugard, but I'm not sure that any of them has written a recent play that can match '' 'Master Harold' ... and the Boys.'' Mr. Fugard's drama - lyrical in design, shattering in impact - is likely to be an enduring part of the theater long after most of this Broadway season has turned to dust.|author=Frank Rich, "'Master Harold,' Fugard's drama on the origin of hate."

This article presents lists of the literary events and publications in '''1649'''.

==Events==
*[[January 1]] – Local authorities raid the four remaining London theatres (the [[Salisbury Court Theatre|Salisbury Court]], [[Red Bull Theatre|Red Bull]], [[Cockpit Theatre|Cockpit]], and [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune]]) to suppress clandestine play-acting. The actors found are arrested &amp;ndash; except for the Red Bull company, who manage to escape.
*[[February 9]] – ''[[Eikon Basilike]]: the Pourtrature of His Sacred Majestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings'', purporting to be the spiritual autobiography of King [[Charles I of England]], is published ten days after his execution, and becomes an enormous popular success. [[John Gauden]] later claims to have written it.
*[[March 24]] (Saturday) – The authorities damage the [[Cockpit Theatre]] to inhibit continued attempts to use it for plays. (The building is not destroyed, however, and in [[1660 in literature|1660]], when drama resumes in England with the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], the theatre is fixed and used again.)
*[[April 23]] – [[William Everard (Digger)|William Everard]] a [[Diggers|Digger]] issues "The Declaration and Standard of the Levellers of England."
* October – [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Eikonoklastes]]: in Answer to a Book Intitl'd Eikon Basilike'', a defence of the execution of Charles I, is published.
*With the London theatres remaining closed since [[1642 in literature|1642]], the trend toward [[closet drama]] (often highly politicized) continues &amp;ndash; and is accentuated by the January 30 execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. In the play ''Newmarket Fair'', [[Oliver Cromwell]] and other Parliamentary leaders commit suicide when they learn of the accession of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (an event that, in actuality, still lies eleven years in the future).
* [[Antoine Girard de Saint-Amant|Antoine Girard]]'s poem ''Rome Ridicule'' starts a fashion for burlesque poetry.
* Sir [[William Davenant]] is appointed treasurer of the colony of Virginia.

'''1917 in film''' was a particularly fruitful year for the art form, and is often cited as one of the years in the decade which contributed to the medium the most, along with [[1913 in film|1913]]. 
Secondarily the year saw a limited global embrace of narrative film-making and featured innovative techniques such as continuity cutting. Primarily, the year is an American landmark, as 1917 is the first year where the narrative and visual style is typified as [[Classical Hollywood cinema|"Classical Hollywood"]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4621">'''Algorithmic choreography''' is the technique of using algorithms to create dance. It is commonly described as using computers for choreographing dances, creating computer animations, studying or teaching aspects of human movement, illustrating dance movements, or assistance in notating dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lansdown|first1=John|title=Computer-Generated Choreography Revisited|url=http://www.4d-dynamics.net/4DD/guest-jl.html|publisher=Proceedings of 4D Dynamics Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be applied in terms of choreographic software for stimulation, enabling real-time choreography and generative dance, or simulation with virtual dancers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gough|first1=Matthew|title=Towards Computer Generated Choreography|url=http://binarybutoh.blogspot.com/2005/09/towards-computer-generated.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the field of [[Dance technology]]. Historically, computers and dance can be traced back to the 1960s, for example, Michael Noll wrote an article about his work, titled "Choreography and Computers", published in Dance Magazine in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noll|first1=Michael|title=Choreography and Computers|url=http://noll.uscannenberg.org/Art%20Papers/Choreography.pdf|publisher=Dance Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple projects have worked with computers and choreography to create movement materials, choreographic scores, and other digital outcomes, for example:
* [[Merce Cunningham]] used the software Lifeforms by Credo Interactive (later Danceforms) to create dance works, starting in the 1990s with Thecla Schiphorst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schiphorst|first1=Thecla|title=A CASE STUDY OF MERCE CUNNINGHAM’S USE OF THE LIFEFORMS COMPUTER CHOREOGRAPHIC SYSTEM IN THE MAKING OF TRACKERS|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~tschipho/publications/Schiphorst_M.A.Thesis.pdf|publisher=Simon Fraser University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ChoreoGraph&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ChoreoGraph/Duplex|url=http://www.sdela.dds.nl/sfd/frankfin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a software tool from 1998 by choreographer [[Michael Klien]] and programmer Nick Rothwell. It was used to generate the score for the work DUPLEX in 2002.
* Improvisation Technologies was a CD-Rom by [[William Forsythe (choreographer)|William Forsythe]] and Christian Ziegler, Produced at ZKM Karlsruhe in 1999&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web|last1=Forsythe|first1=William|title=Publications|url=http://www.williamforsythe.de/publications.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ImprovisationTechnologies|url=http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/werke/ImprovisationTechnologiesAToolfortheAnalyticalDanceEye}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting as a way to document his processes for Ballet Frankfort, Forsythe developed this digital tool for analyzing movement.
* Software for Dancers was a UK-based project lead by Scott deLahunta in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=deLahunta|first1=Scott|title=Software for Dancers|url=http://www.sdela.dds.nl/sfd/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manifesting as a think tank, the project organized several workshops and symposia that explored rehearsal tools in the form of digital dance sketchbooks, performance tools, and documentation of dance.
* Synchronous Objects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synchronous Objects|url=http://synchronousobjects.osu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the score of the Forsythe work One Flat Thing, reproduced (2000), to create data and transform the dance into choreographic objects. These objects include digital components such as the Counterpoint Tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Palazzi|first1=Maria|title=The Objects|url=http://synchronousobjects.osu.edu/content.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wayne McGregor]] has worked with the Choreographic Language Agent, an AI agent used to augment his process since 2004. The most recent iteration of this was Becoming a tool developed with Marc Downie and Nick Rothwell. The aim is to provoke new movement creation in the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choreographic Language Agent|url=http://waynemcgregor.com/research/choreographic-language-agent}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Choreographic Coding Lab&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choreographic Coding Lab|url=http://choreographiccoding.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a touring laboratory looking to explore connections of the data generated during dance and choreography with coding.
* Kate Sicchio joins the fields of algorithmic choreography and [[Live coding]], through her projects Hacking Choreography (2012) and Hacking Choreography 2.0 (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sicchio|first1=Kate|title=Hacking Choreography|url=http://blog.sicchio.com/works/hacking-choreography/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Analogues to Algorithmic Choregraphy can be seen in traditional dance such as the [[Maypole]] dancing.

'''Architectural propaganda''' is the use of [[architecture]], intentionally or unintentionally, to communicate an attitude or idea in a persuasive manner, often for an explicitly [[propaganda|propagandic]] purpose. The use of architecture for propaganda purposes in order to influence attitudes, opinions, and feelings of the target audience can be found in many cultures across history. Since architecture itself is an expression of culture, the propaganda element of architecture can organically flow from the structure by nature of its being.

The fact that something may be used for propaganda is not a values statement about the thing itself. It is a simple truism that people are influenced by things around them and therefore, when those things around include architecture, people will be influenced by it as a part of an environment. This inherent quality of architecture then can be used by those with the desire to do so. This use is what transforms the architecture from a simple influence into a piece of propaganda.

The psychological dimension of architecture and propaganda means that even when a group or government has no direct intent to use architecture for propaganda purposes, the nature of architecture proceeding as it does from the human mind will express something about the designer and his or her culture. The architecture itself becomes an expression of the larger opinions of a cultural or social group which may then be impressed upon others. By virtue of observation of an architectural work, an individual may come to understand something about the original builder and his or her culture. Thus, even with no prior intent, architecture by its very nature has a built-in propaganda value.

==A Holistic Approach to Architecture==

[[Richard Swett]], the former [[Congressman]] from [[New Hampshire]] and US ambassador to [[Denmark]], an architect by training proposed that architecture need not be limited simply to buildings and grand constructions, but rather that architectural design and design considerations should permeate every aspect of life. He proposed that since everything utilized and created is designed at some level, it is possible and indeed necessary to include a great deal of thought and effort in the design of everything from buildings to desk lamps, to silverware.&lt;ref name="Swett"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.di.net/articles/design-diplomacy-architectures-relationship-with-public-policy|title=Design Diplomacy: Architecture's Relationship with Public Policy|last=Swett|first=Richard|date=September 30, 2000|work=[[Design Intelligence]]|accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swett proposed that “examples of integrated artistic, social and environmental harmony created by architects who have served both their calling and the needs of society” are the ideal to be striven for in architectural design. He says that in Denmark, “all aspects of the design of a civilized life’s accouterments, from the shelter we need to the implements for feeding ourselves, are treated with the same high standards of design integrity and respect,”&lt;ref name="Swett"/&gt; and proposes that American architecture and architects ought to follow a similar course. "In one of its articles in 1953, the [[Architectural Forum]] recognised US’s export architecture as a diplomatic tool, appreciating it and presenting US as a state exercising political world leadership and cultural leadership with the latter being driven especially by the US‘s architecture." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://publicandculturaldiplomacy3.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/architecture-diplomacy-undervalued-dimension-of-branding/|title=Design Diplomacy: Architecture's Relationship with Public Policy|last=kag0276|date=March 18, 2012|work=[[Architecture Diplomacy]]|accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecture is a profession that is inherently engaged in public diplomacy by the nature of what it creates and who interacts with it, and that therefore, architects need to consciously participate in public diplomacy through their work rather than unwittingly be a part of it with no awareness of their significance. “The fact is too many architects are seriously marginalized, and I would go so far as to say, intentionally isolated, from the political process that determines the zoning, funding and the complex social and legal regulations that control the building of our shared environment. This subject needs to be confronted, debated and discussed in detail." &lt;ref name="Swett"/&gt; Swett concludes that the architectural profession would do well to develop “by assisting in the design of a blueprint that will frame the future influence of our profession beyond the limitations of bricks and mortar. Such a plan suggests that our fellow architects take up leadership roles in order to balance the tectonic, economic and political aspects of city/state planning more consciously. [[Thomas Jefferson]] also wrote in 1785: “I am proud to be an architect and don’t propose we go out and tear down any buildings. I do propose, however, we tear down some of the myths and misperceptions that architects have about public policy and vice versa.”” &lt;ref name="Swett"/&gt;

Architectural propaganda is not limited simply to a given propaganda value or sum; rather, it has the ability to act in the wider realm of public diplomacy because of its importance and overreaching themes that touch all aspects of life. As such, when talking about [[Canada|Canadian]] public diplomacy, Evan Potter, a [[Professor]] of [[Communications]] at the [[University of Ottawa]] made the following points. He states that the entirety of public diplomacy must be thought of: "(1) temporally, in three time frames; (2) as an essentially contested concept that has many labels, such as cultural diplomacy, political communication, international public relations, democracy building, propaganda, branding, and military information operations; (3) as an endeavor whose effectiveness is linked to the level of societal support and understanding at home; and (4) as a form of statecraft that is not exclusive to foreign ministries but that, according to Bruce Gregory, “cuts across all political, economic, and military instruments and is essential to their implementation and success.” &lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Bruce. "Not Your Grandaparents’ Public Diplomacy," Presentation at the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, November 30, 2005, Retrieved 2013-04-03&lt;/ref&gt; Public diplomacy is not a single instrument or the exclusive preserve of a country’s foreign ministry; rather, it is a process, and as Gregory writes, it has “multiple components, each with their own organizations, budgets, tribal cultures, and rules for applying principles to behavior.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://publicdiplomacymagazine.com/a-new-architecture-for-canadian-public-diplomacy/|title=A New Architecture for Canadian Public Diplomacy |last=Potter|first=Evan|date=June 1, 2010|work=[[Public Diplomacy Magazine]]|accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; These themes are not limited simply to their obvious and stated public diplomacy dimensions, but also to the inherent propaganda and public diplomacy value of architecture itself. It is this connectivity that brings together Swett's and Potter's theories into a practicable and useful set of operational principles for architecture in both its propaganda and public diplomacy aspects. Different countries and groups have utilized the propaganda and public diplomacy aspects of architecture with varying degrees of success and continue to do so today. Below, expanded are some of these countries and groups with examples of their architectural propaganda and public diplomacy.

The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) is currently engaged in a prolonged public relations campaign with many other nations, the developing world particularly. This campaign has been termed a "charm offensive" by [[Joshua Kurlantzick]] in his book of the same name. Among the many elements of soft power used by the PRC is that of architecture. China has a rich architectural tradition to draw from and to publicize with. This allows the PRC government to promote tourism to famous architectural sites like the [[Great Wall]] or the [[Forbidden City]]. Furthermore, a rich architectural history combined with a desire to spread pro-PRC sentiment means that PRC funding of building projects abroad is increasingly common. ". . . Many scholars associated China's aid with giant white-elephant projects, like large buildings and ministries and similar structures."&lt;ref&gt;Kurlantzick, Joshua. Charm Offensive. New Haven and London: Yale University, 2007, 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Great Wall of China may 2007.JPG|thumb|left|alt=The Great Wall of China in May 2007 with many tourists and the PRC Flag.|The Great Wall of China in May 2007 with many tourists and the PRC Flag.]]

In [[Mozambique]], a former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony possessed of largely Portuguese-style architecture, in the capital city, Maputo, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building In [[East Timor]], also a former Portuguese colony, the PRC funded and promoted the construction of that country's foreign ministry and funded the creation of a new East Timor [[embassy]] in [[Beijing]] despite the long-standing antagonism between the two parties.&lt;ref&gt;Kurlantzick, Joshua. Charm Offensive. New Haven and London: Yale University, 2007, 100, 157-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of architecture to fuel tourism in the PRC has been highly successful. China is the third most visited country in the world. The number of overseas tourists was 55.98 million in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hFli5xB9YgVoSunOYYFREW6BozmQ?docId=CNG.f55f656a9f597ee071fe1ead97d63e4a.3b1]&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign exchange income was 45.8 billion [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]s, the world's fourth largest in 2010. The number of domestic tourist visits totaled 1.61 billion, with a total income of 777.1 billion yuan.&lt;ref name="factbox"&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/06/content_8994009.htm  Factbox: Basic facts about China's economy]&lt;/ref&gt; While certainly all of this tourism cannot be attributed to architecture alone, a significant number of the tourist sites visited possess inherent architectural value.

==Corporate==

[[File:Chrysler Building by David Shankbone Retouched.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.50|alt=The Chrysler Building in New York serves as coroprate propaganda for Chrysler Group LLC.|The Chrysler Building in New York serves as coroprate propaganda for Chrysler Group LLC.]]

As part of a corporation's overall marketing and branding campaign, when it comes to constructing a central office or corporate headquarters, architectural marketing or propaganda can be employed. A company's headquarters can be the ultimate expression or symbol of that company.&lt;ref name="Castillo"&gt;Castillo, Greg. Cold War on the Home Front: The Soft Power of Midcentury Design. Minneapolis: Univ Of Minnesota Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A building can make a statement to potential customers, clients, employees, or rivals. The architecture utilized in a corporate building can indicate general philosophies held by the corporation or principles it wishes to espouse. In some cases, corporate architecture can be used to show the success of a given corporation versus its rivals.&lt;ref name="Castillo"/&gt;

Famous examples of corporate architecture can be found in cities around the world. In some cities, skyscrapers serve as unforgettable propaganda for the corporations for which they are named. In other places, corporate sponsorship of sports arenas, performing arts venues, and the sprawling headquarters of the corporations themselves serve as propaganda for their owners. A fine example of corporate architecture and propaganda can be found in the Chrysler Building in New York City. Built from 1928-1930, the Chrysler building gave the Chrysler Corporation a giant piece of advertising and propaganda. Not only could Chrysler lay claim to the tallest building in the world at the time of its completion, but the stainless steel spire of the building was styled after the grilles of then current Chrysler road cars. This huge building served as a massive statement of the success and power of the Chrysler Corporation while at the same time advertising its products to the world through the very architecture of the building.&lt;ref name="Castillo"/&gt;

==Drug Cartel==

Mexican drug cartels have utilized architecture as part of their overall propaganda campaign. Large houses called "''narco mansions'' or ''narco castillos'' (drug mansions or castles)" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/worldview/101026/mexico-drug-war-cartels-newspapers|title=Analysis: A PR department for Mexico's narcos|last=O'Connor|first=Mike|date=November 5, 2010|work=[[GlobalPost]]|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; are becoming an increasingly common feature of the recent drug conflicts in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mexicoinstitute.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/the-narco-generation/|title=The Narco Generation|last=Beckhart|first=Sarah|date=February 21, 2011|work=AL DÍA|publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]'s Mexico Institute|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to overwhelm and sway over local populaces and potential rivals, these demonstrations of wealth and power are built at least partly for their psychological value.

==Nazi==

[[Nazi architecture]] adopted many elements of [[neoclassicism]] and of [[art deco]] in keeping with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s personal fascination with [[Ancient Roman|Ancient Rome]]. Part of the Nazi cult involved the overaweing and subsuming of the individual into the greater German ''volk''. This giving over of oneself to the whole was also expressed through Nazi architecture. The three primary expressed roles found in Nazi architecture are the (i)[[Theatrical]], (ii)[[Symbol]]ic, and (iii)[[Didactic]], but each of these roles has its own place within the larger sphere of propaganda value.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-1130-502, Nürnberg, Reichsparteitag, Lichtdom.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Cathedral of Lights at the 1936 Nuremberg Party Rally. |The Cathedral of Lights at the 1936 Nuremberg Party Rally.]]

Nazi architecture was designed to make the individual feel small and insignificant through its use of high ceilings. For example, at [[Nuremberg rallies]], the feeling produced by the use of massed groups coupled with the architecture of the Zepplintribune architecture was to create wonder and a powerful feeling of community. Indeed, Hitler stated in one of his Nuremberg rally speeches, "Not every one of you sees me and I do not see every one of you. But I feel you and you feel me!".&lt;ref&gt;Baynes, Norman H. The Speeches of Adolf Hitler, April 1922-August 1939, V1 &amp; V2. London: Oxford University Press, 1942. V1 - {{ISBN|0-598-75893-3}} V2 - {{ISBN|0-598-75894-1}} ,197.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Nuremberg rallies, the overall effect of architecture was further enhanced through the use of many searchlights pointed directly upward in order to create a "Cathedral of Light" that even further served to invite the individual to buy into the Nazi worldview.

Another prominent conceptual feature of Nazi architecture was the "[[Ruin value|Theory of Ruin Value]]", first put forward by [[Albert Speer]], Hitler's personal architect. This theory postulated that in order for a civilization's influence to pass beyond the existence of the civilization itself, it was important that aesthetically pleasing and impressive ruins be left by the dilapidated buildings of that civilization. This theory, too, took inspiration from the ancient Romans and Greeks in attempting to emulate the even architectural remains of their civilizations with Nazi ones in thousands of years. Since the original inspiration for Nazi architecture was itself, the ancient Romans and Greeks, it was important to Hitler that at the end of the Thousand Year Reich, the remains would inspire others as Roman ruins had done for him.

An interesting remaining piece of Nazi architecture can be found in the former [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] which closed all airport operations in 2008. The main terminal was designed and built during the late 1930s and early 1940s according to a design by [[Ernst Sagebiel]] following the ideas of Speer and Hitler including that of ruin value. It was designed to be the main hub for Hitler's redesigned Berlin, to be called Germania. When completed, it was the world's largest building and today, should the building fall into disrepair, Speer and Hitler's ruin value theory may be demonstrated.

==United States (Federal)==

[[File:US Capitol Building Front New.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The United States' Capitol Building in Washington, DC exhibits classical Greek architectural features.|The United States' Capitol Building in Washington, DC exhibits classical Greek architectural features.]]

The [[Classical Liberalism|liberal]] ideas of the [[United States]]' [[Founding fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] heavily influenced American Federal architecture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.learner.org/amerpass/unit04/context_activ-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas and creations of the [[Ancient Greeks]] and Romans held great sway not only in the formation of the United States and her founding documents, but also in the ways American ideals came to be expressed physically when it came to designing the Federal City, [[Washington, DC.]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.unrv.com/government.php&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincoln-Memorial WashingtonDC.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC exhibits classical Greek architectural features.|The Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC exhibits classical Greek architectural features.]]

The Embassy of the Hellenic Republic in Washington, DC has hosted lectures on the topic of Greek architectural influence on the Western World and in the United States in particular. Their website says, "Thomas Jefferson once wrote that “design activity and political thought are indivisible.”  He believed that architecture was an important vehicle for expressing political ideals, and he worked to ensure that Washington, as the seat of the American democracy, would become a city of stately and sophisticated buildings based on classical precedents."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office%3D1%26folder%3D14%26article%3D20822 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007144345/http://greekembassy.org/embassy/Content/en/Article.aspx?office=1&amp;folder=14&amp;article=20822 |archivedate=2010-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can clearly be seen that while the modern state of Greece did not even exist at the time of the construction of many American government buildings, the Hellenic Republic is still able to derive some propaganda value and great national prestige from the influence of the ancient Greeks upon world history and architecture.

The style of construction found in the [[Lincoln Memorial]] closely parallels the design of a classical Greek temple. It utilizes a colonnade of thirty-six [[Doric order|Doric]] columns surrounding a central interior made up of three chambers. It serves as a memorial for American President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and for his service to the United States during the United States' [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The neoclassical design serves to reinforce the validity of the values Americans believed this president embodied at the time of the Memorial's construction.&lt;ref&gt;NRHP Nomination: {{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination Form: Lincoln Memorial |last=Pfanz |first=Donald C. |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |url=http://image1.nps.gov:9001/StyleServer/calcrgn?cat=NRHP&amp;item=/Text/NRHP-6340b4580b4649f499fbab210684e03f.djvu&amp;style=nps/FOCUS-DJview.xsl&amp;wid=640&amp;hei=480&amp;oif=jpeg&amp;props=item(SUMMARY,COPYRIGHT) |date=1981-03-24 |accessdate=2012-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224002508/http://image1.nps.gov:9001/StyleServer/calcrgn?cat=NRHP&amp;item=%2FText%2FNRHP-6340b4580b4649f499fbab210684e03f.djvu&amp;style=nps%2FFOCUS-DJview.xsl&amp;wid=640&amp;hei=480&amp;oif=jpeg&amp;props=item%28SUMMARY%2CCOPYRIGHT%29 |archivedate=2012-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This itself is to some degree a self reinforcement, and thereby propaganda promoting the American values expounded therein.

The intent to showcase President Lincoln's connection to the founding values of the United States and to the values of the ancients Greeks and Romans is shown in the architecture of the monument itself. It is the implementation and exhibition of these values combined with the text inscribed on the memorial that transforms it from a simple honoring of a man into the honoring of all that he has been perceived to stand for. Even though the memorial is in President Lincoln's honor, it transcends this purpose and becomes a site for connection with American values themselves. The use of ancient Greek architecture allows for the transfer of the collective American values as passed down from the Lincoln, the Founding Fathers, and the ancient Greeks before them. This is consummate propaganda, it takes values, personifies them and holds them up as something to be aspired to, all through the use of architecture.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Aerial View Rendering New US Embassy Londoin.jpg|thumb|left| alt= The design for the new US Embassy in London. Copyright KieranTimberlake.|The new US Embassy in London exhibits public diplomacy in its design.]] --&gt;

An interesting case study into the public diplomacy effects of architecture within a fixed culture and location is provided by the case of the United States embassy in London. “Public buildings project the identity of a country’s peoples, culture and aspirations. American public buildings convey the collective identity of our rich, culturally diverse, and increasingly complex society. An American embassy’s design expresses to the world the ideals of American democracy—the optimism, hope and promise of our time. By communicating the transcendent values that define the United States as a nation, the new Embassy of the United States of America in London has the potential to embody a new age of American openness, transparency, and renewed commitment to international collaboration.  Architecture itself becomes an act of public diplomacy; as the United States Department of State envisions, the design of the new Embassy “far transcends architecture and engineering… it is fully and firmly within the realm of international diplomacy.”” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://morphopedia.com/projects/new-u-s-embassy-in-london|title= New U.S. Embassy in London|last=Morphosis Team|date=August 31, 2011|work=[[Morphopedia]]|accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old US Embassy in Grosvenor Square became the subject of intense dislike by the local inhabitants of London when, following the September 11, 2001 attacks, “the area surrounding the embassy was transformed into a fortress, complete with heavily armed guards, ugly security corridors and unsightly bollards – all of which defaced the elegant square.”&lt;ref name="Bar-Hillel"&gt;{{cite news|title=The US Embassy's move to Vauxhall|url= http://www.thelondonmagazine.co.uk/Property-Experts/Expert-Opinions/The-US-Embassys-move-to-Vauxhall.html|last= Bar-Hillel |first= Mira |date=October 1, 2012|work=[[The London Magazine]]|accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The new US Embassy integrates aspects of British landscaping and site design, rather than high fences, to create security”; “The main building itself will be “clad in glass to emphasise a transparent, open atmosphere.”&lt;ref name="Bar-Hillel"/&gt; The use of architecture itself in the design of the new US Embassy in London to present American ideals and values through the building itself is ingenious and exhibits well thought out and executed public diplomacy and propaganda value in its design.

[[File:YEAROFTHEDRAGONSF1979.jpg|thumb|Playwright Frank Chin portrays "Fred Eng" in the Asian American Theater Workshop production of ''Year of the Dragon'' in San Francisco, California 1977]]
The '''Asian American Theater Company''' (AATC) is a non-profit theatre performance company based in San Francisco. Its stated mission is "To connect people to Asian American culture through theatre".

==Background==
The Asian American Theater Company was established in 1973 by playwright [[Frank Chin]] to develop and present original works of [[Asian American theatre|theatre about Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent]]. AATC is credited as a progenitor of the Asian-American theater movement alongside [[East West Players]] and [[Pan Asian Repertory Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Houston, Velina Hasu. "Currents: Out of the Margins: A National Theatre Conference in Los Angeles Galvanizes Asian-American Forces." ''American Theatre'' 10 2006: 132–7&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being a producing company, AATC is a workshop where [[Asian people|Asian]] [[Pacific Islander]] writers, actors and directors can explore ideas and create works that carry with them the AATC's purpose, which is to explore who [[Asian American|Asian Pacific Islander Americans]] are as a people and as a community.

For many years the Asian American Theater Company was housed in The Asian American Theater Center located near the corner of Arguello and Clement Streets in San Francisco’s ethnically diverse Richmond district. The Theater Center suffered much damage from the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], but was able to re-open its doors a year later. The costly repairs however created a heavy economic burden and in 1996 the Asian American Theater Company moved its administrative offices to Japantown, and produced its plays in various theater venues throughout the city such as the Off-Market Theater and the Thick House. Today the administrative offices reside in San Francisco's Potrero Hill neighborhood at 1695 18th Street.

==Programs==

The company's main stage productions are new plays and revivals of classics by Asian Pacific Islander American playwrights, directed, performed and designed by local talent.  Most scripts will have been developed at AATC and each will be presented at various venues around the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] with full-production run.

Under its emerging artists project, young actors, many  of whom are making their acting debut, perform plays by new playwrights or revivals of classics by established artists.  Many of the actors and writers taking part in the Emerging Artists Project have participated in the Training Program.

The group hosts staged readings, where scripts under development are directed, rehearsed and presented, followed by discussion and critique.  Readings are free or a nominal donation is requested.  Scripts from women and under-represented Asian Pacific Islander groups are especially welcome.

A training program consisting of two semesters a year of courses in acting, scene study, voice and movement and playwright's workshops, conducted by professional artists, offered at low cost.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3204">The '''Association for Research into Crimes against Art''' ('''ARCA''') is a research and outreach organization that works to promote research and the study of art crime and cultural heritage protection. ARCA aims to bridge the gap between the practical and theoretical by fostering collaboration between foreign and domestic law enforcement officials, security consultants, academics, lawyers, archaeologists, insurance specialists, criminologists, art historians, conservators, and others. Their goal is to raise public awareness about art related crime and to better preserve the world's collective cultural heritage.

At the grassroots level, ARCA objective is to identify emerging and under-examined trends related to the study of art crime and to develop strategies to advocate for the responsible stewardship of our collective artistic and archaeological heritage. ARCA advances this mission through educational programming, research, publications and public outreach at the national and international level to foster an exchange of knowledge in the field.

As part of this work, ARCA sponsors a [[Postgraduate Certificate Program in Art Crime and Cultural Heritage Protection]] which is held from June to August every year in Italy.  It also publishes the ''Journal of Art Crime'', and hosts an annual academic conference on [http://www.artcrimeresearch.org/interdisciplinary-art-crime-conference/ art crime and cultural heritage at risk.]

==Media==
Dan Brown mentions ARCA and their blog in his novel ''[[Inferno (Dan Brown novel)|Inferno]]'' (2013).  In chapter 72, Robert Langdon uses the ARCA website to check the history of the Four Horses of the Basilica San Marco, and is startled by the passage:

"''The decorative collars were added to the horses' necks in 1204 by the Venetians to conceal where the heads had been severed to facilitate their transportation by ship from Constantinople to Venice.''"&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Dan.  "Inferno."  Bantam: 2013.  Pg 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

This passage is taken from a series of [http://art-crime.blogspot.it/2011/06/judge-arthur-tompkins-on-four-horses-of.html four articles] discussing the long and tumultuous history of the Four Horses of the Basilica San Marco, the art work with the longest history of crimes against it, written by Judge Arthur Tompkins.  Judge Tompkins is an ARCA trustee and faculty member, who teaches a course on Art Crimes in War as part of ARCA's Postgraduate Certificate Program and includes detailed discussion of the Four Horses as part of his course.

'''Born Against''' was an American [[hardcore punk]] band from [[New York, New York|New York]] active between 1989–1993.&lt;ref name="St.Louis News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/stlouis/anarchy-in-the-ozarks-whod-have-guessed-there-used-to-be-a-hardcore-punk-scene-in-the-backwaters-of-missouri/Content?oid=2483867|title=Anarchy in the Ozarks: Who'd have guessed there used to be a hardcore punk scene in the backwaters of Missouri?|date=2009-01-13|publisher=St.Louis News|accessdate=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to their [[Far-left politics|radical leftist]] politics, the group espoused a [[DIY ethic|DIY punk]] message and challenged what they perceived as being a problem within the punk subculture of their time. Though Born Against received little media exposure while still together, they have since been described as "legendary" by the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' and the ''[[LA Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name="ChicagoReader"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2012/04/11/a-qanda-with-sam-mcpheeters | title=A Q&amp;A with Sam McPheeters | publisher=''[[Chicago Reader]]'' | date=11 April 2012 | accessdate=27 December 2015 | author=Raymer, Miles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAWeekly"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/sam-mcpheeters-of-the-90s-punk-band-born-against-on-his-bizarre-novel-about-las-angriest-chevron-owner-2372842 | title=Sam Mcpheeters, of the '90s Punk Band Born Against, on His Bizarre Novel About L.A.'S Angriest Chevron Owner | publisher=''[[LA Weekly]]'' | date=9 April 2012 | accessdate=27 December 2015 | author=Lapin, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The group was founded in early 1989 by guitarist [[Adam Nathanson]] and bassist [[Neil Burke]], vocalist [[Sam McPheeters]], and drummer John Guzman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xjwalkx.tripod.com/born.html |title=Born Against Is Fucking Dead |publisher=Xjwalkx.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was replaced in early rehearsals by a drummer named George.{{cn|date=December 2015}}  George's tenure was also brief, and he was replaced after a single show by Nigel Schreiber in July 1989.&lt;ref name="sammcpheeters.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sammcpheeters.com/music/ba-shows.htm |title=All Born Against Shows |publisher=Sammcpheeters.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303021226/http://www.sammcpheeters.com/music/ba-shows.htm |archivedate=2012-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This lineup recorded a demo cassette and a track for the ''Murders Among Us'' 7" compilation released on McPheeters' [[Vermiform Records]] label before Burke and Schreiber left the group late in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandtoband.com/band/born-against/murders-among-us |title=Born Against - Murders Among Us - compilation |publisher=BandToBand.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Born Against would continue to be plagued by rhythm section fluctuation throughout its career.  

In March 1990, the band reemerged with bassist Javier Villegas and drummer Darryl Kahan.  The band issued its first two vinyl releases, the ''Eulogy'' single (whose anti-religious title track was dedicated to Steve Reddy of [[Equal Vision Records]]) and a self-titled 7" EP, and several compilation tracks.  Later this year, Kahan was replaced by drummer John Hiltz, birthing the longest lasting incarnation of the band.  The group toured extensively, and released a debut LP, 1991's ''Nine Patriotic Hymns for Children'', on Vermiform.  Villegas left the group in late 1991.  He was replaced in Born Against by bassist Bret Blue.

With Hiltz and Blue, Born Against continued its extensive touring, including a trip to Europe.  By this point, the band's aggressive political message and related critique of their contemporaries had attracted media attention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xjwalkx.tripod.com/~xjwalkx/Presspage/noanswers.html |title=Interview by Kent McClard |publisher=Xjwalkx.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they endured animosity in New York City and beyond.{{cn|date=December 2015}}  They began work on a new record, which was stalled in July 1992 when Hiltz left the group.  The final sessions that produced the resultant 10" record, ''Battle Hymns of the Race War'', featured Melissa York on drums, although York never performed live with the group.

By early 1993, Nathanson and McPheeters had relocated to [[Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]] and begun a new version of the band with bassist [[Tonie Joy]] (of [[Moss Icon]] and [[Universal Order of Armageddon]]) and drummer [[Brooks Headley]] (also from Universal Order of Armageddon).  Although only extant for seven months, this was a prolific incarnation, as they continued to tour and released split 7"s with [[Screeching Weasel]] (in which both bands swapped lyrics) and Universal Order of Armageddon.  Their radical leftist stance became increasingly drenched in cynicism, which slowly threatened to overtake their message{{cn|date=December 2015}} – the results of this evolution are evidenced in the nonsense song "Lillian" and other non-sequitur pieces from this time.  Their final release was a split 8" record with [[Man is the Bastard]], and the group played its final show in July 1993.&lt;ref name="sammcpheeters.com"/&gt;

Two posthumous CDs containing the entire Born Against canon (aside from their demo tape) have since been released – ''Patriotic Battle Hymns''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Born-Against-Patriotic-Battle-Hymns/master/60322 |title=Discogs page about "Patriotic Battle Hymns" |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=discogs.com |publisher=discogs.com |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (featuring ''Nine Patriotic Hymns for Children'' and ''Battle Hymns of the Race War'') and ''The Rebel Sound of Shit and Failure''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Born-Against-The-Rebel-Sound-Of-Shit-And-Failure/master/60324 |title=Discogs page about "The Rebel Sound Of Shit And Failure" |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=discogs.com |publisher=discogs.com |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (featuring all other material).&lt;ref name="StylusMagazine"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/born-against-the-rebel-sound-of-shit-and-failurepatriotic-battle-hymns.htm | title=Born Against - The Rebel Sound of Shit and Failure/Patriotic Battle Hymns | publisher=[[Stylus Magazine]] | date=1 September 2003 | accessdate=27 December 2015 | author=Smith, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AllMusic-TheRebelSound"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-rebel-sound-of-shit-and-failure-vermiform-mw0000945428 | title=The Rebel Sound of Shit and Failure [Vermiform] | publisher=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=27 December 2015 | author=Kott, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially released on the now-defunct Vermiform, these records have since been taken on by the [[Kill Rock Stars]] and [[Prank Records]] imprints.&lt;ref name="AllMusic-Biography"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/born-against-mn0000090160/biography | title=Born Against | publisher=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=27 December 2015 | author=Kott, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Burney Relief''' (also known as the '''Queen of the Night''' relief) is a [[Mesopotamia]]n [[terracotta]] plaque in high [[relief]] of the Isin-Larsa or Old-[[Babylon]]ian period, depicting a winged, nude, goddess-like figure with bird's talons, flanked by owls, and perched upon two lions.

The relief is displayed in the [[British Museum]] in London, which has dated it between 1800 and 1750&amp;nbsp;BCE. It originates from southern Mesopotamia, but the exact find-site is unknown. Apart from its distinctive [[iconography]], the piece is noted for its high relief and relatively large size, which suggest that it was used as a [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] relief, making it a very rare survival from the period. However, whether it represents [[Lilith|Lilitu]], [[Inanna|Inanna/Ishtar]], or [[Ereshkigal]] is under debate. The authenticity of the object has been questioned from its first appearance in the 1930s, but opinion has generally moved in its favour over the subsequent decades.

==Provenance==
[[File:Burney, or the Queen of the Night, relief inside a display case. The British Museum, London.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=The Burney Relief inside its display case|The Burney Relief inside a display case in the British Museum in London]]
Initially in the possession of a [[Syria]]n dealer, who may have acquired the plaque in southern Iraq in 1924, the relief was deposited at the British Museum in London and analysed by [[Harold Plenderleith|Dr. H.J. Plenderleith]] in 1933. However, the Museum declined to purchase it in 1935, whereupon the plaque passed to the London antique dealer [[Sidney Burney]]; it subsequently became known as the "Burney Relief".&lt;ref name="HF"&gt;[[#refHF37|Frankfort 1937.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The relief was first brought to public attention with a full-page reproduction in ''[[Illustrated London News|The Illustrated London News]]'', in 1936.&lt;ref name="ILN"&gt;[[#refFD36|Davis 1936.]]&lt;/ref&gt; From Burney, it passed to the collection of Norman Colville, after whose death it was acquired at auction by the Japanese collector Goro Sakamoto. British authorities, however, denied him an export licence. The piece was loaned to the British Museum for display between 1980 and 1991, and in 2003 the relief was purchased by the Museum for the sum of [[£]]1,500,000 as part of its 250th anniversary celebrations. The Museum also renamed the plaque the "Queen of the Night Relief".&lt;ref name="DC"&gt;[[#refDC05|Collon 2003.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the object has toured museums around Britain.

Unfortunately, its original [[provenance]] remains unknown. The relief was not [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeologically excavated]], and thus we have no further information where it came from, or in which [[Stratification (archaeology)|context]] it was discovered. An interpretation of the relief thus relies on stylistic comparisons with other objects for which the date and place of origin have been established, on an analysis of the iconography, and on the interpretation of textual sources from [[Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian mythology and religion]].&lt;ref name="The Queen of the Night"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Albenda|first=Pauline|date=April–June 2005|title=The Queen of the Night Plaque A Revisit|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|publisher=American Oriental Society|volume=125|issue=2|pages=171–190|jstor=20064325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Burney Relief side.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Side view of relief|Side view showing depth of the relief]]
Detailed descriptions were published by [[Henri Frankfort]] (1936),&lt;ref name="HF" /&gt; by Pauline Albenda (2005),&lt;ref name="PA"&gt;[[#refPA05|Albenda 2005.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and in a [[monograph]] by Dominique Collon, former curator at the British Museum, where the plaque is now housed.&lt;ref name="DC" /&gt; The composition as a whole is unique among works of art from Mesopotamia, even though many elements have interesting counterparts in other images from that time.&lt;ref name="History of art" /&gt;

===Physical aspect===
The relief is a [[terracotta]] (fired [[clay]]) [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]], {{convert|50|x|37|cm|in}} large, {{convert|2|to|3|cm|in}} thick, with the head of the figure projecting {{convert|4.5|cm|in}} from the surface. To manufacture the relief, clay with small [[calcareous]] inclusions was mixed with [[chaff]]; visible folds and fissures suggest the material was quite stiff when being worked.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDC03|Collon 2003, 13.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The British Museum's Department of Scientific Research reports, "it would seem likely that the whole plaque was moulded" with subsequent modelling of some details and addition of others, such as the [[rod-and-ring symbol]]s, the tresses of hair and the eyes of the owls.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in [[#refDC07b|Collon 2007b]]&lt;/ref&gt; The relief was then burnished and polished, and further details were incised with a pointed tool. Firing burned out the chaff, leaving characteristic voids and the pitted surface we see now; Curtis and Collon believe the surface would have appeared smoothed by [[ochre]] paint in antiquity.&lt;ref name="JC"&gt;[[#refJC96|Curtis 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its dimensions, the unique plaque is larger than the mass-produced terracotta plaques&amp;nbsp;– popular art or devotional items&amp;nbsp;– of which many were excavated in house ruins of the [[History of Mesopotamia#Isin-Larsa.2C Old Babylonian and Shamshi-Adad I|Isin-Larsa]] and [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian]] periods.&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;Such plaques are about {{convert|10|to|20|cm|in}} in their longest dimension. Cf. the plaque [http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=24780 AO 6501 at the Louvre], the plaque [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=389330&amp;partid=1 BM WA 1994-10-1, 1 at the British Museum], or an actual mould: [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=389740&amp;partid=1 BM WA 1910-11-12, 4, also at the British Museum] ([[#refJC96|Curtis 1996]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the relief is in excellent condition. It was originally received in three pieces and some fragments by the British Museum; after repair, some cracks are still apparent, in particular a triangular piece missing on the right edge, but the main features of the [[deity]] and the animals are intact. The figure's face has damage to its left side, the left side of the nose and the neck region. The headdress has some damage to its front and right hand side, but the overall shape can be inferred from symmetry. Half of the necklace is missing and the symbol of the figure held in her right hand; the owls' beaks are lost and a piece of a lion's tail. A comparison of images from 1936 and 2005 shows that some modern damage has been sustained as well: the right hand side of the crown has now lost its top tier, and at the lower left corner a piece of the mountain patterning has chipped off and the owl has lost its right-side toes.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[#refFD36|Davis 1936]]; [[#refDC05|Collon 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in all major aspects, the relief has survived intact for more than 3,500&amp;nbsp;years.

[[File:Queen of night-IMG 4581-coloured.svg|thumb|Approximate colour scheme of the painted relief]]
Traces of red pigment still remain on the figure's body that was originally painted red overall. The feathers of her wings and the owls' feathers were also colored red, alternating with black and white. By [[Raman spectroscopy]] the red pigment is identified as [[red ochre]], the black pigment, amorphous carbon ("[[lamp black]]") and the white pigment [[gypsum]].&lt;ref name="DC_07b"&gt;[[#refDC07b|Collon 2007b.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Black pigment is also found on the background of the plaque, the hair and eyebrows, and on the lions' manes.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;[[cf.]] the color-scheme reconstruction on the [https://archive.is/20121223091238/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/t/the_queen_of_the_night_relief.aspx British Museum page]&lt;/ref&gt; The pubic triangle and the [[areola]] appear accentuated with red pigment but were not separately painted black.&lt;ref name="DC_07b" /&gt; The lions' bodies were painted white. The British Museum curators assume that the horns of the headdress and part of the necklace were originally colored yellow, just as they are on a very similar clay figure from [[Ur]].&lt;ref name="Ur-god"  group= "nb"&gt;According to the British Museum, this figure &amp;ndash; of which only the upper part is preserved &amp;ndash; presumably represents the sun-god [[Shamash]] (cf. [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=278544&amp;partid=1 details of 1931,1010.2])&lt;/ref&gt; They surmise that the bracelets and rod-and-ring symbols might also have been painted yellow. However, no traces of yellow pigment now remain on the relief.

===The female figure===
[[File:Burney Relief bust.jpg|thumb|alt=Detail of female bust|Detail of bust with traces of pigment on the left hand]]
The [[nude]] female figure is realistically sculpted in high-relief. Her eyes, beneath distinct, joined eyebrows, are hollow, presumably to accept some inlaying material&amp;nbsp;– a feature common in stone, [[alabaster]], and [[bronze]] sculptures of the time,&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;cf. the [http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/ancient_near_eastern_art/standing_male_worshiper/objectView.aspx?&amp;OID=30002390&amp;collID=3&amp;vw=0 ''Male Worshiper''] and [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/edys/ho_62.70.2.htm ''Standing Female Figure''] in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt; but not seen in other Mesopotamian clay sculptures. Her full lips are slightly upturned at the corners. She is adorned with a four-tiered headdress of horns, topped by a disk. Her head is framed by two braids of hair, with the bulk of her hair in a bun in the back and two wedge-shaped braids extending onto her breasts.

The stylized treatment of her hair could represent a ceremonial wig. She wears a single broad necklace, composed of squares that are structured with horizontal and vertical lines, possibly depicting beads, four to each square. This necklace is virtually identical to the necklace of the god found at [[Ur]], except that the latter's necklace has three lines to a square. Around both wrists she wears bracelets which appear composed of three rings. Both hands are symmetrically lifted up, palms turned towards the viewer and detailed with visible life-, head- and heart [[Chiromancy#Lines|lines]], holding two [[rod-and-ring symbol]]s of which only the one in the left hand is well preserved. Two wings with clearly defined, stylized feathers in three registers extend down from above her shoulders. The feathers in the top register are shown as overlapping scales ([[Covert (feather)|coverts]]), the lower two registers have long, staggered [[flight feather]]s that appear drawn with a ruler and end in a convex trailing edge. The feathers have smooth surfaces; no [[Barb (feather)|barbs]] were drawn. The wings are similar but not entirely symmetrical, differing both in the number of the flight feathers&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;The right wing has eight flight feathers, the left wing has seven.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the details of the coloring scheme.&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;The lower register of the right wing breaks the white-red-black pattern of the other three registers with a white-black-red-black-white sequence.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her wings are spread to a triangular shape but not fully extended. The breasts are full and high, but without separately modelled nipples. Her body has been sculpted with attention to naturalistic detail: the deep navel, structured abdomen, "softly modeled pubic area"&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;[[#refPA05|Albenda (2005)]] notes "a tiny vertical indentation" but [[#refDC07b|Collon (2007b)]] clarifies that this is merely a missing flake over a repaired fracture.&lt;/ref&gt; the recurve of the outline of the hips beneath the [[iliac crest]], and the bony structure of the legs with distinct knee caps all suggest "an artistic skill that is almost certainly derived from observed study".&lt;ref name="PA" /&gt; A spur-like protrusion, fold, or tuft extends from her calves just below the knee, which Collon interprets as [[dewclaws]]. Below the shin, the figure's legs change into those of a bird. The bird-feet are detailed,&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;cf. [[:Image:ButasturFoot.png|image of the foot of an Indian falcon]]&lt;/ref&gt; with three long, well-separated toes of approximately equal length. Lines have been scratched into the surface of the ankle and toes to depict the [[scute]]s, and all visible toes have prominent [[Claw#Birds|talons]]. Her toes are extended down, without [[Perspective (graphical)#Foreshortening|perspective foreshortening]]; they do not appear to rest upon a ground line and thus give the figure an impression of being dissociated from the background, as if hovering.&lt;ref name="PA" /&gt;

===The animals and background===
[[File:Burney Relief lions.jpg|thumb|alt=Detail of lions|Detail showing lions on bottom of the relief]]
[[File:Burney Relief owl and lion.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Detail of owl|Detail of owl on bottom right of relief]]
The two lions have a male mane, patterned with dense, short lines; the manes continue beneath the body.&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;[[#refDO36|D. Opitz (1936)]] interprets this mane pattern as depicting the indigenous [[Barbary lion]]. D.&amp;nbsp;Collon prefers an interpretation as the related [[Asiatic lion]] and notes that a skin in the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London shows the distinctive [[Hair whorl|whorl]] in the mane that is often represented in Mesopotamian art ([[#refDC05|Collon 2005, 34]]), but also in Egyptian art (cf. [[:File:Tutanhkamun headrest.jpg|Tutanhkamun headrest]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctly patterned tufts of hair grow from the lion's ears and on their shoulders, emanating from a central disk-shaped [[Hair whorl|whorl]]. They lie prone; their heads are sculpted with attention to detail, but with a degree of artistic liberty in their form, e.g., regarding their rounded shapes. Both lions look towards the viewer, and both have their mouths closed.

The owls shown are recognizable, but not sculpted naturalistically: the shape of the beak, the length of the legs, and details of plumage deviate from those of the owls that are indigenous to the region.&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;Iraq's indigenous owls without ear-tufts include the [[Barn owl|Barn Owl (''Tyto alba'')]]&amp;nbsp;– this is the owl that D.&amp;nbsp;Collon believes to be represented in the relief ([[#refDC05|Collon 2005, 36]])&amp;nbsp;– the [[Little owl|Little Owl (''Athene noctua lilith'')]] and the [[Strix aluco|Tawny Owl (''Strix aluco'')]].&lt;/ref&gt; Their plumage is colored like the deity's wings in red, black and white; it is bilaterally similar but not perfectly symmetrical. Both owls have one more feather on the right-hand side of their plumage than on the left-hand side. The legs, feet and talons are red.

The group is placed on a pattern of scales, painted black. This is the way mountain ranges were commonly symbolized in Mesopotamian art.

==Context==

===Date and place of origin===
Stylistic comparisons place the relief at the earliest into the [[Isin]]–[[Larsa]] period,&lt;ref name="VB"&gt;[[#refEV36|Van Buren 1936]].&lt;/ref&gt; or slightly later, to the beginning of the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian]] period.&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;The relief is therefore neither [[Sumer]]ian or [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ian - that would have been even earlier - nor [[Assyria]]n - that would located it to northern Mesopotamia.&lt;/ref&gt; Frankfort especially notes the stylistic similarity with the sculpted head of a male deity found at [[Ur]],&lt;ref name="HF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ur-god"  group= "nb" /&gt; which Collon finds to be "so close to the Queen of the Night in quality, workmanship and iconographical details, that it could well have come from the same workshop."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDC05|Collon 2005, 20]].&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Ur is one possible city of origin for the relief, but not the only one: [[Edith Porada]] points out the virtual identity in style that the lion's tufts of hair have with the same detail seen on two fragments of clay plaques excavated at [[Nippur]].&lt;ref name="EP"&gt;[[#refEP80|Porada 1980]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;cf. Plates 142:8 and 142:10 in [[#refDM78|McCown 1978]]. By stratification with dated clay-tablets, one of these similar fragments has been assigned to the Isin–Larsa period (dates between 2000 and 1800&amp;nbsp;BCE), the other to the adjacent Old Babylonian period (dates between 1800 and 1700&amp;nbsp;BCE) ([[short chronology]]).&lt;/ref&gt; And Agnès Spycket reported on a similar necklace on a fragment found in [[Isin]].&lt;ref&gt;quoted in [[#refDC07b|Collon 2007b]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geopolitical context===
A creation date at the beginning of the second millennium BCE places the relief into a region and time in which the political situation was unsteady, marked by the waxing and waning influence of the city states of [[Isin]] and [[Larsa]], an invasion by the [[Elamites]], and finally the conquest by [[Hammurabi]] in the unification in the [[Babylon|Babylonian empire]] in 1762&amp;nbsp;BCE.

300 to 500 years earlier, the population for the whole of Mesopotamia was at its all-time high of about 300,000. [[Elam]]ite invaders then toppled the [[Lament for Ur|third Dynasty of Ur]] and the population declined to about 200,000; it had stabilized at that number at the time the relief was made.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWT04|Thompson 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt; Cities like [[Nippur]] and [[Isin]] would have had on the order of 20,000 inhabitants and [[Larsa]] maybe 40,000; Hammurabi's [[Babylon]] grew to 60,000 by 1700&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;George Modelski, quoted in [[#refWT04|Thompson 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt; A well-developed infrastructure and complex division of labour is required to sustain cities of that size. The fabrication of religious imagery might have been done by specialized artisans: large numbers of smaller, devotional plaques have been excavated that were fabricated in molds.

Even though the [[fertile crescent]] civilizations are considered the oldest in history, at the time the Burney Relief was made other late [[bronze age]] civilizations were equally in full bloom. Travel and cultural exchange were not commonplace, but nevertheless possible.&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;cf. the Egyptian 12th dynasty [[story of Sinuhe]]&lt;/ref&gt; To the east, [[Elam]] with its capital [[Susa]] was in frequent military conflict with Isin, Larsa and later Babylon. Even further, the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] was already past its peak, and in China, the [[Erlitou culture]] blossomed. To the southwest, Egypt was ruled by [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|the 12th dynasty]]; further to the west the [[Minoan civilization]], centred on Crete with the Old Palace in [[Knossos]], dominated the Mediterranean. To the north of Mesopotamia, the Anatolian [[Hittites]] were establishing their Old Kingdom over the [[Hattians]]; they brought an end to Babylon's empire with the sack of the city in 1531&amp;nbsp;BCE. Indeed, Collon mentions this raid as possibly being the reason for the damage to the right-hand side of the relief.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDC05|Collon 2005, 22]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The size of the plaque suggests it would have belonged in a shrine, possibly as an object of worship; it was probably set into a mud-brick wall.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHF37|Frankfort 1937]]; [[#refTJ87|Jacobsen 1987]].&lt;/ref&gt; Such a shrine might have been a dedicated space in a large private home or other house, but not the main focus of worship in one of the cities' temples, which would have contained representations of gods sculpted in the round. Mesopotamian temples at the time had a rectangular [[cella]] often with niches to both sides. According to [[Thorkild Jacobsen]], that shrine could have been located inside a brothel (see below).&lt;ref name="TJ"&gt;[[#refTJ87|Jacobsen 1987]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Funerary siren Louvre Myr148.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cast terracotta funerary figure, a [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] made in [[Myrina (Mysia)]], 1st century BCE]]

===Art history===
Compared with how important religious practice was in Mesopotamia, and compared to the number of temples that existed, very few cult figures at all have been preserved. This is certainly not due to a lack of artistic skill: the "[[Ram in a Thicket]]" (see image below) shows how elaborate such sculptures could have been, even 600 to 800 years earlier. It is also not due to a lack of interest in religious sculpture: deities and myths are ubiquitous on [[cylinder seal]]s and the few [[stele]]s, [[kudurru]]s, and reliefs that have been preserved. Rather, it seems plausible that the main figures of worship in temples and shrines were made of materials so valuable they could not escape looting during the many shifts of power that the region saw.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAS68|Spycket 1968, 11]]; [[#refTA05|Ornan 2005, 60&amp;nbsp;ff]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Burney Relief is comparatively plain, and so survived. In fact, the relief is one of only two existing large, figurative representations from the Old Babylonian period. The other one is the top part of the [[Code of Hammurabi]], which was actually discovered in Elamite [[Susa]], where it had been brought as booty (see image).

A static, frontal image is typical of religious images intended for worship. Symmetric compositions are common in Mesopotamian art when the context is not narrative.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;A narrative context depicts an event, such as the investment of a king. There, the king opposes a god, and both are shown in profile. Whenever a deity is depicted alone, a symmetrical composition is more common. However, the shallow relief of the cylinder seal entails that figures are shown in profile; therefore, the symmetry is usually not perfect.&lt;/ref&gt; Many examples have been found on cylinder seals. Three-part arrangements of a god and two other figures are common, but five-part arrangements exist as well. In this respect, the relief follows established conventions. In terms of representation, the deity is sculpted with a naturalistic but "modest" nudity, reminiscent of Egyptian goddess sculptures, which are sculpted with a well-defined navel and pubic region but no details; there, the lower hemline of a dress indicates that some covering is intended, even if it does not conceal. In a typical statue of the genre, Pharaoh [[Menkaura]] and two goddesses, [[Hathor]] and [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]] are shown in human form and sculpted naturalistically, just as in the Burney Relief; in fact, [[Hathor]] has been given the features of Queen Khamerernebty&amp;nbsp;II (see image and [[Menkaura|article]]). Depicting an anthropomorphic god as a naturalistic human is an innovative artistic idea that may well have diffused from Egypt to Mesopotamia, just like a number of concepts of religious rites, architecture, the "banquet plaques", and other artistic innovations previously.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOK06|Kaelin 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, the Burney Relief shows a clear departure from the schematic style of the worshiping men and women that were found in temples from periods about 500 years earlier (see image). It is also distinct from the next major style in the region: [[Assyria]]n art, with its rigid, detailed representations, mostly of scenes of war and hunting (see image).

The extraordinary survival of the figure type, though interpretations and cult context shifted over the intervening centuries, is expressed by the cast terracotta funerary figure of the 1st century BCE, from [[Myrina (Mysia)|Myrina]] on the coast of [[Mysia]] in Asia Minor, where it was excavated by the French School at Athens, 1883; the terracotta is conserved in the [[Musée du Louvre]] (''illustrated left'').

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Iconography===
[[Mesopotamian religion]] recognizes literally thousands of deities, and distinct [[iconography|iconographies]] have been identified for about a dozen. Less frequently, gods are identified by a written label or dedication; such labels would only have been intended for the literate elites. In creating a religious object, the sculptor was not free to create novel images: the representation of deities, their attributes and context were as much part of the religion as the rituals and the mythology. Indeed, innovation and deviation from an accepted canon could be considered a cultic offense.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTO05|Ornan 2005, 8&amp;nbsp;ff.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The large degree of similarity that is found in plaques and seals suggests that detailed iconographies could have been based on famous cult statues; they established the visual tradition for such derivative works but have now been lost.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDC07|Collon 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; It appears, though, that the Burney Relief was the product of such a tradition, not its source, since its composition is unique.&lt;ref name="History of art"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janson|first1=Horst Woldemar |last2=Janson|first2=Anthony F. |title=History of art: the Western tradition |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MMYHuvhWBH4C&amp;pg=PT80&amp;lpg=PT80&amp;dq=Mesopotamian+art+owls#v=onepage&amp;q=Yet%20the%20image&amp;f=false|edition=6th Revised |date=1 July 2003|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0-13-182895-7|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Frontal nudity====
[[File:Ishtar vase Louvre AO17000.jpg|thumb|upright|The "Ishtar Vase", early 2nd&amp;nbsp;millennium BCE, [[Larsa]]. Note how the schematic depiction of the goddess' feet corresponds to the feet of the birds walking above her. Louvre, AO&amp;nbsp;1700.]]
The frontal presentation of the deity is appropriate for a plaque of worship, since it is not just a "pictorial reference to a god" but "a symbol of his presence".&lt;ref name="HF" /&gt; Since the relief is the only existing plaque intended for worship, we do not know whether this is generally true. But this particular depiction of a goddess represents a specific motif: a nude goddess with wings and bird's feet. Similar images have been found on a number of plaques, on a vase from Larsa, and on at least one cylinder seal; they are all from approximately the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEV36|Van Buren (1936)]] shows three such examples, [[#refMB52|Barrelet (1952)]] shows six more such representations and [[#refDC05|Collon (2005)]] adds yet another plaque to the canon.&lt;/ref&gt; In all instances but one, the frontal view, nudity, wings, and the horned crown are features that occur together; thus, these images are iconographically linked in their representation of a particular goddess. Moreover, examples of this motif are the only existing examples of a nude god or goddess; all other representations of gods are clothed.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[#refTO05|Ornan 2005, Fig.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;220]].&lt;/ref&gt; The bird's feet have not always been well preserved, but there are no counter-examples of a nude, winged goddess with human feet.

====Horned crown====
The horned crown&amp;nbsp;– usually four-tiered– is the most general symbol of a deity in Mesopotamian art. Male and female gods alike wear it. In some instances, "lesser" gods wear crowns with only one pair of horns, but the number of horns is not generally a symbol of "rank" or importance. The form we see here is a style popular in Neo-Sumerian times and later; earlier representations show horns projecting out from a conical headpiece.&lt;ref name="JB92"&gt;[[#refJB92|Black 1992]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wings====
Winged gods, other mythological creatures, and birds are frequently depicted on cylinder seals and steles from the 3rd millennium all the way to the Assyrians. Both two-winged and four-winged figures are known and the wings are most often extended to the side. Spread wings are part of one type of representation for [[Ishtar]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDC07|Collon 2007,&amp;nbsp;80]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the specific depiction of the hanging wings of the nude goddess may have evolved from what was originally a cape.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMB52|Barrelet 1952]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rod and ring symbol====
{{Main article|Rod-and-ring symbol}}
This symbol may depict the measuring tools of a builder or architect or a token representation of these tools. It is frequently depicted on cylinder seals and steles, where it is always held by a god&amp;nbsp;– usually either [[Shamash]], [[Ishtar]], and in later Babylonian images also [[Marduk]]– and often extended to a king.&lt;ref name="JB92" /&gt;

====Lions====
Lions are chiefly associated with [[Ishtar]] or with the male gods [[Shamash]] or [[Ningirsu]].&lt;ref name="TJ" /&gt; In Mesopotamian art, lions are nearly always depicted with open jaws. H.&amp;nbsp;Frankfort suggests that The Burney Relief shows a modification of the normal canon that is due to the fact that the lions are turned towards the worshipper: the lions might appear inappropriately threatening if their mouths were open.&lt;ref name="HF" /&gt;

====Owls====
No other examples of owls in an iconographic context exist in Mesopotamian art, nor are there textual references that directly associate owls with a particular god or goddess.

====Mountains====
A god standing on or seated on a pattern of scales is a typical scenery for the depiction of a [[theophany]]. It is associated with gods who have some connection with mountains but not restricted to any one deity in particular.&lt;ref name="TJ" /&gt;

==Identification==
[[File:Ishtar goddess.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A different photograph of the relief]]
The figure has initially been identified as a depiction of Ishtar (Inanna)&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;Inanna is the Sumerian name and Ishtar the Akkadian name for the same goddess. Sacral text was usually written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] at the time the relief was made, but [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] was the spoken language; this article therefore uses the Akkadian name Ishtar for consistency, except where "Inanna" has been used by the authors whose sources are quoted.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ILN" /&gt; but almost immediately other arguments have been put forward:

===Lilitu===
The identification of the relief as depicting "[[Lilith]]" has become a staple of popular writing on that subject. [[Raphael Patai]] (1990)&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRP90|Patai 1990,&amp;nbsp;221]].&lt;/ref&gt; believes the relief to be the only extant depiction of a Sumerian female demon called ''lilitu'' and thus to define ''lilitu's'' iconography. Citations regarding this assertion lead back to [[Henri Frankfort]] (1936). Frankfort himself based his interpretation of the deity as the demon Lilith on the presence of wings, the birds' feet and the representation of owls. He cites the Babylonian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] as a source that such "creatures are inhabitants of the land of the dead".&lt;ref&gt;Gilgamesh, Plate VII, col. IV&lt;/ref&gt; In that text [[Enkidu|Enkidu's]] appearance is partially changed to that of a feathered being, and he is led to the nether world where creatures dwell that are "birdlike, wearing a feather garment".&lt;ref name="HF" /&gt; This passage reflects the Sumerians' belief in the nether world, and Frankfort cites evidence that [[Nergal]], the ruler of the underworld, is depicted with bird's feet and wrapped in a feathered gown.

However Frankfort did not himself make the identification of the figure with Lilith; rather he cites [[Emil Kraeling]] (1937) instead. Kraeling believes that the figure "is a superhuman being of a lower order"; he does not explain exactly why. He then goes on to state "Wings [...] regularly suggest a demon associated with the wind" and "owls may well indicate the nocturnal habits of this female demon". He excludes [[Lamashtu]] and [[Pazuzu]] as candidate demons and states: "Perhaps we have here a third representation of a demon. If so, it must be Lilîtu [...] the demon of an evil wind", named ''ki-sikil-lil-la''&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;''ki-sikil-lil-la'' (Krealing) and ''ki-sikil-lil-la-ke'' (Albenda) appear to be mistaken readings of the original Sumerian passage from the Gilgamesh epos: ''ki-sikil'' lit. ''ki-'' earth-untouched/pure i.e. virgin or maiden, ''lil&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' wind; breath; infection; phantom; ''-la-'' is gen. case marker and ''-ke&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' erg. case marker, both are required by the grammatical context (in this passage: "''kisikil'' built for herself") but the case markers are not part of the noun.&lt;/ref&gt; (literally "wind-maiden" or "phantom-maiden", not "beautiful maiden", as Kraeling asserts (see below)).&lt;ref name="EK37"&gt;[[#refEK37|Kraeling 1937]].&lt;/ref&gt; This ''ki-sikil-lil'' is an antagonist of Inanna (Ishtar) in a brief episode of the epic of Gilgamesh, which is cited by both Kraeling and [[Henri Frankfort|Frankfort]] as further evidence for the identification as Lilith, though this appendix too is now disputed. In this episode, Inanna's holy Huluppu tree is invaded by malevolent spirits.  Frankfort quotes a preliminary translation by Gadd (1933): "in the midst Lilith had built a house, the shrieking maid, the joyful, the bright queen of Heaven". However modern translations have instead: "In its trunk, the phantom maid built herself a dwelling, the maid who laughs with a joyful heart. But holy Inanna cried."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.8.1.4 Gilgameš, Enkidu and the nether world], lines 44-46&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier translation implies an association of the demon Lilith with a shrieking owl and at the same time asserts her god-like nature; the modern translation supports neither of these attributes. In fact, Cyril J. Gadd (1933), the first translator, writes:  "''ardat lili'' (''kisikil-lil'') is never associated with owls in Babylonian mythology" and "the Jewish traditions concerning Lilith in this form seem to be late and of no great authority".&lt;ref name="CG"&gt;[[#refCG33|Gadd 1933]].&lt;/ref&gt; This single line of evidence being taken as virtual proof of the identification of the Burney Relief with "Lilith" may have been motivated by later associations of "Lilith" in later Jewish sources.

The association of Lilith with owls in later Jewish literature such as the ''[[Songs of the Sage]]'' (1st century BCE) and [[Babylonian Talmud]] (5th century CE) is derived from a reference to a ''liliyth'' among a list of wilderness birds and animals in Isaiah (7th century BCE), though some scholars, such as Blair (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Judit M. Blair ''De-demonising the Old Testament; an investigation of Azazel, Lilith, Deber, Qeteb and Reshef in the Hebrew Bible'' 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120708120722/http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=KjvIsai.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=34&amp;division=div1 Isaiah 34:14]&lt;/ref&gt; consider the pre-Talmudic Isaiah reference to be non-supernatural, and this is reflected in some modern Bible translations:
:Isaiah 34:13 Thorns shall grow over its strongholds, nettles and thistles in its fortresses. It shall be the haunt of jackals, an abode for ostriches. 14 And wild animals shall meet with hyenas; the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; indeed, there the night bird (''lilit'' or ''lilith'') settles and finds for herself a resting place. 15 There the owl nests and lays and hatches and gathers her young in her shadow; indeed, there the hawks are gathered, each one with her mate. (ESV)
Today, the identification of the Burney Relief with Lilith is questioned,&lt;ref&gt;Lowell K. Handy article Lilith Anchor Bible Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; and the figure is now generally identified as the goddess of love and war.&lt;ref&gt;Bible Review Vol 17 Biblical Archaeology Society - 2001 "LILITH? In the 1930s, scholars identified the voluptuous woman on this terracotta plaque (called the Burney Relief) as the Babylonian demoness Lilith. Today, the figure is generally identified as the goddess of love and war "&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ishtar===
50&amp;nbsp;years later, [[Thorkild Jacobsen]] substantially revised this interpretation and identified the figure as [[Inanna]] (Akkadian: [[Ishtar]]) in an analysis that is primarily based on textual evidence.&lt;ref name="TJ" /&gt; According to Jacobsen:

*The hypothesis that this tablet was created for worship makes it unlikely that a demon was depicted. Demons had no cult in Mesopotamian religious practice since demons "know no food, know no drink, eat no flour offering and drink no libation."&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;cf. [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.4.1# line 295 in "Inanna's descent into the nether world"]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, "no relationship of giving and taking could be established with them";
*The horned crown is a symbol of divinity, and the fact that it is four-tiered suggests one of the principal gods of the Mesopotamian pantheon;
*Inanna was the only goddess that was associated with lions. For example, a hymn by [[En-hedu-ana]] specifically mentions "Inanna, seated on crossed (or harnessed) lions"&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;Jacobsen quotes [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.4.07.3 Inana C, line 23] and the motif of Inana standing on lions is well attested from seals and plaques (cf. the image of Ishtar, above);&lt;/ref&gt;
*The goddess is depicted standing on mountains. According to text sources, Inanna's home was on ''Kur-mùsh'', the mountain crests. Iconographically, other gods were depicted on mountain scales as well, but there are examples in which Inanna is shown on a mountain pattern and another god is not, i.e. the pattern was indeed sometimes used to identify Inanna.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTO05|Ornan 2005, 61&amp;nbsp;f]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*The rod-and-ring symbol, her necklace and her wig are all attributes that are explicitly referred to in the myth of ''Inanna's descent into the nether world''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTJ87|Jacobsen 1987]], (original at [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.4.1 "Inana's descent to the nether world"])&lt;/ref&gt;
*Jacobsen quotes textual evidence that the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ''eššebu'' (owl) corresponds to the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] word ''ninna'', and that the Sumerian ''&lt;sup&gt;[[Dingir|D]]&lt;/sup&gt;nin-ninna'' (Divine lady ''ninna'') corresponds to the Akkadian Ishtar. The Sumerian ''ninna'' can also be translated as the Akkadian ''kilili'', which is also a name or epithet for Ishtar. Inanna/Ishtar as harlot or goddess of harlots was a well known theme in Mesopotamian mythology and in one text, Inanna is called ''kar-kid'' (harlot) and ''ab-ba-[šú]-šú'', which in Akkadian would be rendered ''kilili''. Thus there appears to be a cluster of metaphors linking prostitute and owl and the goddess Inanna/Ishtar; this could match the most enigmatic component of the relief to a well known aspect of Ishtar. Jacobsen concludes that this link would be sufficient to explain talons and wings, and adds that nudity could indicate the relief was originally the house-altar of a bordello.&lt;ref name="TJ" /&gt;

===Ereshkigal===
In contrast, the British Museum does acknowledge the possibility that the relief depicts either Lilith or Ishtar, but prefers a third identification: Ishtar's antagonist and sister [[Ereshkigal]], the goddess of the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/t/queen_of_the_night_relief.aspx|title=Queen of the night relief|work=[[The British Museum]]|accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is based on the fact that the wings are not outspread and that the background of the relief was originally painted black. If this were the correct identification, it would make the relief (and by implication the smaller plaques of nude, winged goddesses) the only known figurative representations of Ereshkigal.&lt;ref name="PA" /&gt; Edith Porada, the first to propose this identification, associates hanging wings with demons and then states: "If the suggested provenience of the Burney Relief at Nippur proves to be correct, the imposing demonic figure depicted on it may have to be identified with the female ruler of the dead or with some other major figure of the Old Babylonian pantheon which was occasionally associated with death."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEP80|Porada 1980, 260]].&lt;/ref&gt; No further supporting evidence was given by Porada, but another analysis published in 2002 comes to the same conclusion. E. von der Osten-Sacken describes evidence for a weakly developed but nevertheless existing cult for Ereshkigal; she cites aspects of similarity between the goddesses Ishtar and Ereshkigal from textual sources – for example they are called "sisters" in the myth of "Inanna's descent into the nether world" – and she finally explains the unique doubled rod-and-ring symbol in the following way: "Ereshkigal would be shown here at the peak of her power, when she had taken the divine symbols from her sister and perhaps also her identifying lions".&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEV02|Von der Osten-Sacken 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
The 1936 ''London Illustrated News'' feature had "no doubt of the authenticity" of the object which had "been subjected to exhaustive chemical examination" and showed traces of [[bitumen]] "dried out in a way which is only possible in the course of many centuries".&lt;ref name ="ILN" /&gt; But stylistic doubts were published only a few months later by D. Opitz who noted the "absolutely unique" nature of the owls with no comparables in all of Babylonian figurative artefacts.&lt;ref name="DO"&gt;[[#refDO36|Opitz 1936]].&lt;/ref&gt; In a back-to-back article, E. Douglas Van Buren examined examples of Sumerian {{Sic}} art, which had been excavated and provenanced and she presented examples: Ishtar with two lions, the Louvre plaque (AO 6501) of a nude, bird-footed goddess standing on two Ibexes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=24780|title=(AO 6501) Déesse nue ailée figurant probablement la grande déesse Ishtar |work=Musée du [[Louvre]]|language=French|accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar plaques, and even a small [[haematite]] owl, although the owl is an isolated piece and not in an iconographical context.

A year later Frankfort (1937) acknowledged Van Buren's examples, added some of his own and concluded "that the relief is genuine". Opitz (1937) concurred with this opinion, but reasserted that the iconography is not consistent with other examples, especially regarding the rod-and-ring symbol. These symbols were the focus of a communication by Pauline Albenda (1970) who again questioned the relief's authenticity. Subsequently the British Museum performed [[thermoluminescence dating]] which was consistent with the relief being fired in antiquity; but the method is imprecise when samples of the surrounding soil are not available for estimation of background radiation levels. A rebuttal to Albenda by Curtis and Collon (1996) published the scientific analysis; the British Museum was sufficiently convinced of the relief to purchase it in 2003. The discourse continued however: in her extensive reanalysis of stylistic features, Albenda once again called the relief "a pastiche of artistic features" and "continue[d] to be unconvinced of its antiquity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Albenda
|first= Pauline |date=Apr–Jun 2005 |title= The "Queen of the Night" Plaque: A Revisit |journal= [[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]|volume= 125 |issue= 2 |pages= 171–190|publisher=American Oriental Society
 |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her arguments were rebutted in a rejoinder by Collon (2007), noting in particular that the whole relief was created in one unit, i.e. there is no possibility that a modern figure or parts of one might have been added to an antique background; she also reviewed the iconographic links to provenanced pieces. In concluding Collon states: "[Edith Porada] believed that, with time, a forgery would look worse and worse, whereas a genuine object would grow better and better. [...] Over the years [the Queen of the Night] has indeed grown better and better, and more and more interesting. For me she is a real work of art of the Old Babylonian period."

In 2008/9 the relief was included in exhibitions on Babylon at the [[Pergamon Museum]] in [[Berlin]], the [[Louvre]] in Paris, and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;"British Museum collection database"&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carbuncle Awards''' are [[architecture]] prizes, given by the Scottish magazine ''[[Urban Realm]]'', formerly ''Prospect'', presented to buildings and areas in Scotland intermittently since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanrealm.com/carbuncles |title=Carbuncles |work=urbanrealm.com |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were established following a discussion about why policy initiatives to improve the quality of the built environment seemed to be having so little impact beyond the centres of Scotland’s key cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanrealm.com/carbuncles/2005/The_Carbuncle_Awards_2005.html |title=The Carbuncle Awards 2005 |work=urbanrealm.com |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the awards is derived from a comment by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], an outspoken critic of modern architecture, who in 1984 described [[Ahrends Burton Koralek]]'s proposed extension of London's [[National Gallery]] as a "monstrous [[carbuncle]] on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/may/17/architecture.regeneration|title=Life after carbuncles|first=Jonathan|last=Glancey|date=17 May 2004|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html|title=A speech by HRH The Prince of Wales at the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), Royal Gala Evening at Hampton Court Palace|accessdate=2014-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213205/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three award categories:
*Plook on the Plinth Award "for the most dismal town in Scotland". A "plook" is a Scottish noun for [[pimple]].
*The Pock Mark Award "for the worst planning decision".
*The Zit Building Award "for the worst building completed since the last awards".

Public nominations are made via the magazine's website, with a small group of critics selecting the final winners.

[[Cumbernauld]] in [[Lanarkshire]] has won the Plook on the Plinth Award twice and is the town most frequently nominated for the award.

The Carbuncle Awards inspired the [[Carbuncle Cup]], another [[architecture]] prize launched in 2006 and given annually by ''[[Building Design]]'' magazine to "the ugliest building in the [[United Kingdom]] completed in the last 12 months."&lt;ref name=bd2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/six-in-race-for-carbuncle-cup/5003099.article |title=Six in race for Carbuncle Cup |date=22 July 2010 |author=Watson, Anna |work=bdonline.co.uk |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter has gone on to achieve somewhat greater prominence in the media.

'''Cesare Biseo''' (April 18, 1843 – January 25, 1909) was an [[Italy|Italian]] painter known mainly for his [[Orientalism|orientalist]] themes.

==Biography==

He was born in Rome to a family originally from [[Brescia]]. He trained under his father. He initially worked in decorative paintings of houses. Biseo was invited by the [[Khedive|Viceroy of Egypt]] to [[Alexandria, Egypt]], to decorate his palace. This trip gave him subjects for future works as painter. He returned to the Muslim world; for example, in the company of [[Stefano Ussi]] and [[Edmondo De Amicis]]. They were part of the first embassy to [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140124142556/https://it-it.facebook.com/events/281123258565516/ Gli Orientalisti] exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt; With De Amicis, Biseo published a book on observations in ''Morocco'' and ''Costantinople'', edited by the brothers Treves of [[Milan]]. In the 1887 Mostra di Venezia, he exhibited watercolors titled: ''Ricordi de Cairo''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zz0bAAAAYAAJ  ''Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti.''], by [[Angelo de Gubernatis]]. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cristina Yang''', [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], is a fictional character from the [[medical drama]] television series ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which has aired for over 14 years on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) in the United States. The character was created by series producer [[Shonda Rhimes]], and is portrayed by actress [[Sandra Oh]]. Introduced as a [[Internship (medicine)|surgical intern]] at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, Yang worked her way up to [[Residency (medicine)|resident]] level, eventually becoming a [[Cardiothoracic surgery|cardiothoracic surgical]] [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellow]], while her relationships with colleagues [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[George O'Malley]] ([[T. R. Knight]]), [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]), and [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]) formed a focal point of the series. Yang earlier in the series got engaged to [[Preston Burke]] ([[Isaiah Washington]]), in the past had a relationship with renowned surgeon and mentor Colin Marlow, and wed but later divorced [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]).

Oh originally auditioned for the role of [[Miranda Bailey]], although [[Chandra Wilson]] was ultimately cast in the part. Oh has received generally positive reviews for her portrayal, with Mark Perigard of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' considering her friendship with Meredith to be "the secret core of ''Grey's''". Oh has also garnered numerous awards and nominations for her role as Yang, including [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] and [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] wins in 2006. She was additionally nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] each year, from 2005 to 2009. Characterizing the character, ABC noted her competitiveness, ambition, and intelligence as her main traits, while her aggressive, and tactless attitude was highlighted as her main weakness. In May 2012, ''[[E! Online]]'' reported that Oh had signed on for two more years, along with her fellow cast members. Oh left the show after season 10, and her character Cristina Yang was written out of the storyline as a main cast member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2013/08/13/greys-anatomy-sandra-oh-leaving-cristina-yang/|title=Grey's Anatomy Shocker: Sandra Oh Leaving After 10 Years -- 'I Am Ready to Let Cristina Go'|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|date=13 August 2013|website=tvline.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storylines and character ==
Cristina Yang is introduced as a graduate from [[Smith College]] and a fellow [[surgery|surgical]] [[Internship (medicine)|intern]] to [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]), [[George O'Malley]] ([[T.R. Knight]]), and [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]); the five of them working under [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]). An [[atheism|atheistic]] competitive intern of Korean-American ancestry, she first desired to become a doctor after a childhood car accident which killed her biological father. Yang also suffers from [[dyslexia]], and was raised in [[Beverly Hills]], [[California]] by her mother and supportive [[Jewish]] stepfather. She has BA from [[Smith College]], an MD from [[Stanford University]] and a PhD from [[University of California, Berkeley]], making her a "double doctor". While her emotional pragmatism, competitive perfectionism, and logical nature lead many to view her as a cutthroat "robot", Cristina hits it off with Meredith on their first day and the pair soon become best friends and each other's "person", sharing the same "dark and twisty" sense of humor.

During her internship, Cristina has an on-off relationship with the chief of [[cardiothoracic surgery]] [[Preston Burke]] ([[Isaiah Washington]]) that leads to an accidental pregnancy. Yang schedules an abortion without telling him about the pregnancy due to Burke's behavior towards their lack of relationship status. However, Yang experiences an [[ectopic pregnancy]] and Burke discovers the pregnancy after Yang collapses from a burst [[fallopian tube]]. Burke and Yang begin a relationship in the aftermath of her miscarriage. After Burke is shot in the arm and develops a hand tremor, Yang helps him cover it up by developing a covert partnership wherein she performs most of his surgeries. Yang initially denies involvement during a confrontation, but then confesses everything to [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]), the chief of surgery. Yang's actions jeopardize Burke's chances of becoming chief, which he sees as a huge betrayal. After a short breakup, Yang breaks the silence and Burke proposes marriage, which Yang accepts after eight days of hesitation. Burke calls off the wedding, leaving Yang at the altar. She goes on her honeymoon to [[Hawaii]] with Meredith to recover, returning to discover that Burke has disappeared from her life and transferred to a different hospital.

Burke is replaced by [[Erica Hahn]] ([[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]]), who immediately dislikes Yang for her trend of having affairs with famous surgeons, such as Burke, going so far as refusing to let her scrub in on cardiac surgeries. Eventually, [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]) moves in with Yang, and she still tries to earn Hahn's approval. Hahn reveals that she dislikes Yang because she reminds her of an early version of herself and continues to cut Yang out of cardio surgeries and neglects to teach her, before eventually quitting the hospital and leaving Seattle Grace without a head of cardio.  Without a teacher, Yang begins to seriously doubt the purpose of remaining in her place at Seattle Grace when the program falls to twelfth on a list of the best teaching hospitals, and Burke wins the Harper-Avery award without mentioning her at all, despite her saving his career. Yang tells the Chief that her current existence in the hospital is "unbearable" and that she has turned into a ghost.

Yang meets [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]), an army [[trauma surgeon]], when he patches her up from being stabbed in the stomach by a falling icicle. The pair are immediately attracted to each other and share a brief kiss. After Owen Hunt is honorably discharged, he is hired as Seattle Grace's chief of [[trauma surgery]] and he and Yang begin a flirtation. Yang grows emotionally when she decides to support Meredith in her relationship with [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), despite her logical misgivings about their staying power, and begins to be more emotionally open towards Hunt. However, Hunt has repressed memories of his time in [[Iraq]] and [[PTSD]] which causes Hunt to behave erratically, and attack and strangle her while asleep. Yang attempts to be emotionally supportive, but ends their relationship as she is afraid of sleeping next to him. Cristina loses her shot at being the first resident to perform a solo surgery despite being unanimously chosen by the attending surgeons, having been disciplined from failing to report the irresponsible behavior of the new interns. Meredith and Cristina have a fight during the intern scandal, and Cristina chooses Alex to be her replacement. They eventually reconcile. When Izzie Stevens discovers her life-threatening [[cancer]], Yang is the one she confides in over her other friends due to Yang's ability to remain emotionally distant. Yang saves Izzie's life by coming up with a treatment plan and forcing Izzie to tell their friends of her diagnosis. Hunt begins seeing a therapist, and Yang confesses her love for him. The pair begin a tentative relationship, hampered by Hunt's therapeutic progress and his hot and cold professional behavior, wherein he frequently ignores or penalizes Yang to avoid the appearance of favoritism.

Hunt hires ex-colleague from the Army, [[Teddy Altman]] ([[Kim Raver]]), to become the chief of cardio-thoracic surgery as a "gift" for Yang, after she breaks down over having no new head of cardio. Yang is unimpressed with Altman, neither published nor famous, but her calm proficiency and belief in Yang's skills win her over. A conflict arises in the trio due to Altman and Hunt's repressed feelings for each other. Altman chooses to resign her place as temporary head of cardio because of her feelings for Hunt. Devastated by the blow to her education and the depressing potential of returning to her previous directionless state, Yang begs Altman to stay and teach her, offering Hunt to Altman in exchange. Altman intellectually understands Yang choosing her gift over a man and their relationship is repaired, but Hunt is very hurt that Yang would trade him away. Hunt subconsciously tries to sabotage Yang's education and the two break up again after Hunt is unable to decide between the two women. Cristina saves Derek's life with a gun to her head after he is shot by Gary Clarke, a grieving widow who commits mass murder at the hospital. Hunt is injured by the same shooter after he chooses to return for Yang over Altman, and Grey treats him as Yang saves Grey's husband. Following the attack on the hospital, Hunt and Yang impulsively decide to get married. Yang is suffering from severe PTSD and is unable to bear being alone, making marriage to Hunt, who understands what she's going through, attractive. Yang spends the early days of her marriage in shock and hiding at Meredith's.

Due to having severe PTSD and being unable to do her job correctly anymore, Cristina quits and begins bartending and eventually throws a housewarming party. Derek helps Cristina emotionally and she ultimately decides to go to work after helping the victim of a school shooting. Yang discovers she is pregnant with Hunt's child, and decides to get an abortion. Though Hunt accompanies her to the abortion, he is extremely angry with her decision. Yang then operates on Henry Burton ([[Scott Foley]]), Altman's husband, unknown of his identity. When the surgery fails and he dies, Yang is guilt stricken upon learning of her patient's identity. Altman forgives Yang and forces Yang to realize that she did everything possible. Altman's mentorship of Yang is punishing at times, and Altman brutally emphasizes that Yang must learn patience, compassion, and the basics over the flashy surgeries Yang prefers. Altman's tutelage is successful, and Yang evolves into an aware and well-rounded surgeon because of it. Altman allows Yang to come up with a wish list of dream surgeries to fulfill before Altman resigns and moves on.

Yang and Hunt distance themselves from each other as they keep fighting over the abortion, despite attending marriage counselling. Hunt has a [[one-night stand]] with a patient's friend, leaving Yang heartbroken. She decides to move on, unsure of her future with him. As the end of the fifth year of [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] is near, the surgical residents, including Yang, prepare for their [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|medical boards]] and for the different fellowships they plan on joining. After she passes her exams, Yang reconciles with Hunt and tells him she is leaving Seattle for the [[Mayo Clinic]], Minnesota. Afterward, Yang, Meredith, Shepherd, [[Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]), [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]), and [[Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]) are involved in an [[aviation accident]] while on the way to [[Boise, Idaho]] to perform surgery on conjoined twins. Lexie dies, and Mark later succumbs to his injuries after they are rescued and dies. Following their rescue, Yang, traumatized, suffers from [[brief reactive psychosis]] which provokes violent outbursts and makes her unresponsive. Yang leaves Seattle to become a [[Cardiothoracic surgery|cardiothoracic surgical]] [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellow]] and goes, as planned, to the Mayo Clinic, but has difficulties adapting to her new colleagues' way of working. While in Minnesota, Yang develops a friendship with a near-retirement cardio surgeon, Craig Thomas ([[William Daniels]]). She mainly teases him with comments regarding his old age. She also begins an affair with the head of surgery Dr. Parker ([[Steven Culp]]) who has issues with Thomas. After Thomas dies from a heart attack, Yang returns to Seattle.

Cristina is re-hired and Owen asks for a divorce once Cristina wants to reconcile. Shocked, Cristina agrees, but later finds out that the potential conflict of interest regarding the plane crash lawsuit was a key motive behind Owen's request and confronts him. Owen tells her that he 'feels responsible' and was worried as he thought she was dead. They have a sexual relationship after divorcing. The hospital is sued and found guilty of negligence. The surviving doctors, including Yang, must receive $15 million of compensation each, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurers refuse to pay. Yang, [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]), and the other surviving doctors buy the hospital with the help of the Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. After buying the hospital, Yang realizes that she was made for the O.R. and breaks things off with Owen because he still wants kids and she still doesn't.

After breaking up with Owen, Cristina continues to excel at surgery and becomes de facto chief of cardio. Although supportive of Meredith's choice to become a mother, Cristina points out the fact that it has hurt Meredith's career and clinical judgement. This causes a wedge in their friendship. Grey attempts to catch up professionally with a research trial, but the divide widens when Cristina's trial overshadows Grey's and steals Grey's resources. When Dr. Shane Ross, a second-year resident, stands up to Meredith for her, Cristina gives Shane a kiss. Later, she begins sleeping with him, as well as becoming his mentor and passing on the skills learned from Altman. Cristina's project is immensely successful and she is informed that she could be considered for the Harper Avery award from her 3-D printing of a heart conduit. Grey and Yang reconcile when Grey acknowledges that Yang is correct, she has surpassed Grey, and that Grey is jealous of Yang's professional freedom and success, while her own is hampered by her family.

Cristina is nominated for the Harper Avery award and is a strong candidate, however she is passed over due to her relationship with the Harper-Avery Foundation that co-owns the hospital. Cristina goes to speak at a hospital in Zurich, Switzerland, orchestrated by [[Preston Burke]] who built his own hospital following his winning of the Harper Avery. He offers Cristina his job as the head of the hospital so that he can spend more time with his wife and kids.

Cristina accepts the offer and interviews candidates for her replacement position at the hospital, including Maggie Pierce for new chief of cardio. Cristina transfers her hospital shares to Alex Karev and recommends he take over her seat on the board.

At the end of season 10, she says goodbye to her fellow co-workers she has come to know and love including Owen and Meredith. Cristina and Meredith share special moments together reminiscing about all the horrors they went through and dancing it out one last time. Cristina leaves for Zurich with surgical intern Shane Ross, who chooses to leave in order to study under her in Switzerland.

===Casting and creation===
[[File:Sandra Oh 2016.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Sandra Oh]]'s character was not supposed to be of Asian descent.]]

On the creation of Yang, [[Shonda Rhimes]] said the character contained "a little bit of [her] personality".&lt;ref name=OhAud&gt;{{cite web|last=Oakley|first=Colleen|title=Interview with Shonda Rhimes|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/greys-anatomy|work=[[Marie Claire]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=May 26, 2012|date=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking with talk show host [[Oprah Winfrey]], Rhimes said: "Cristina was second, simply because she's the kind of woman I know really well, and I like her. There's something interesting about a person who is that driven, a little bit emotionally disconnected but still a caring, sweet, and smart individual you could be friends with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Oprah-Interviews-Greys-Anatomy-Creator-Shonda-Rhimes/4 |last=Winfrey |first=Oprah |title=Oprah Interviews Grey's Anatomy Creator Shonda Rhimes |work=[[O, The Oprah Magazine]] |publisher=[[Harpo Productions]] |date=December 2006 |accessdate=September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandra Oh]], initially auditioned for the character of Bailey, adding: "Thank God I did not get that part", explaining the show would not be the same without fellow cast member, Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Sandra Oh|year=2007|title=Grey's Anatomy- Sandra Oh Audition|publisher=Paley Center|accessdate=May 26, 2012|time=0:05-0:15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ8avIEuD9I&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing casting Oh as Yang, Rhimes said: "She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say."&lt;ref name=OhAud/&gt;

The character of Yang was not originally supposed to be of Asian descent. Oh said her character was "a pert little blonde and the thing is the woman who runs the show, Shonda Rhimes, is a black woman, which makes a big [expletive] difference."&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/movies/17devr.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2 |last=De Vries |first=Hilary |title=All That Korean Rage, Unbottled |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=October 17, 2004 |accessdate=September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, when asked why Oh signed on for ''Grey's Anatomy'', Oh said:
: "I'm very proud of this show and I think it came along at the right time for me. It's a changing time on television because five or ten years ago you wouldn't have a major network show where half of the cast were not white."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanbolt.com/headline/7250/Interview:_Sandra_Oh_from_Grey%27s_Anatomy/page2 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130122223731/http://www.fanbolt.com/headline/7250/Interview:_Sandra_Oh_from_Grey's_Anatomy/page2 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 January 2013 |title=Interview: Sandra Oh from Grey's Anatomy (Page 2) |publisher=''Fanbolt'' |date=24 September 2009 |accessdate=3 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oh's original contract with the show expired after [[Grey's Anatomy (season 8)|season eight]], however, ''[[E!

===Characterization===
The [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) characterized Yang as "competitive", "ambitious", and "intelligent", while also noting her weaknesses: "bossy", "aggressive", and "tactless".&lt;ref name="abc char"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/greys-anatomy/bio/cristina-yang/94909 |title=Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) Bio |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |work=[[Grey's Anatomy]] |accessdate=September 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023175254/http://abc.go.com/shows/greys-anatomy/bio/cristina-yang/94909 |archivedate=October 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oh said of her character: "I've always tried to play Cristina with a tremendous amount of focus and ambition—which is the reality for a female surgeon. I mean, in real life there aren't many of them. But the ones you encounter are at the very top of their game. You have to have a kind of ascetic personality to survive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/sandra-oh |last=Newman |first=Judith |title=Marie Claire Sandra Oh Interview |work=Marie Claire |publisher=Hearst Corporation |date=March 7, 2007 |accessdate=September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Pickens, Jr.]] who portrays Dr. Webber said: "That character itself set a bar in terms of how we look at millennial women: independent yet vulnerable, seriously competitive yet caring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grey's Anatomy: The Cast Says Farewell to Sandra Oh |url=http://www.tvguide.com/special/finale-preview/PhotoGallery/Greys-Anatomy-Cast-1081066/1081073 |work=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate=May 1, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032531/http://www.tvguide.com/special/finale-preview/PhotoGallery/Greys-Anatomy-Cast-1081066/1081073 |archivedate=May 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhimes referred to Yang's relationship with Burke by the [[portmanteau]] "Burktina", citing "[[Losing My Religion (Grey's Anatomy)|Losing My Religion]]" as one of her favorite episodes featuring them because it shows their evolution from the beginning of the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 2)|second season]] to its end.&lt;ref name="grey matter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rhimes |first=Shonda |title=From Shonda Rhimes (FINALLY)... |url=http://www.greyswriters.com/2006/05/from_shonda_rhi.html |work=Grey Matter |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |accessdate=July 14, 2012 |date=May 17, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319141934/http://www.greyswriters.com/2006/05/from_shonda_rhi.html |archivedate=March 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Kevin McKidd1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kevin McKidd]]'s character was introduced as a love interest for Yang.]]
Rhimes commented, "[We see] her struggle to suppress all of her humanity in pursuit of perfection. And in my mind, what we realize is that she is not cold. She is terrified. Scared that if she lets her emotions out, they will overtake her and she will be hurt. And you can't hate her. Because it's so incredibly human and understandable."&lt;ref name="grey matter"/&gt; Yang's friendship with Meredith has been looked upon as "sisterhood", and Yang has repeatedly referred to the former as "her person". This led to the two being dubbed "the twisted sisters". At the conclusion of [[Grey's Anatomy (season 3)|season three]], the duo went on a "honeymoon" together, and Rhimes called it her favorite detail of the [[Didn't We Almost Have It All?|finale]].&lt;ref name="ChangeC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greyswriters.com/2007/10/shonda-on-the-s.html |title=Shonda on the Season Premiere Episode "A Change Is Gonna Come"... |publisher=Grey Matter |website=greyswriters.com |date=October 3, 2007 |accessdate=June 19, 2012 |author=Rhimes, Shonda |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331153229/http://www.greyswriters.com/2007/10/shonda-on-the-s.html |archivedate=March 31, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York (magazine)|New York magazine]]'' wrote of the character: "There's probably no woman on TV right now more single-mindedly dedicated to her career than Cristina. It has long been her defining characteristic. If it occasionally makes her into a caricature, it has also unquestionably established that she would have an abortion in this circumstance."&lt;ref name="NYmag1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Paskin|first=Willa|title=A Character on Grey's Anatomy Actually Had an Abortion on Prime-Time Television Last Night|url=http://www.vulture.com/2011/09/someone_actually_had_an_aborti.html|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York magazine]]|accessdate=September 10, 2012|date=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talking about Yang's abortion in the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 8)|eighth season]], Rhimes explained she intended Yang to have an abortion already in the second season but changed it with an ectopic pregnancy at the suggestion of one of her writers because  "that was so much more interesting, story-wise". As for the abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes commented: "I really wanted Cristina Yang to stay true to who Cristina Yang is. And I feel like that is a character who has never really wanted to be a mother. The idea that this woman would have a child that she did not want and resented for ruining her career and resented Owen for making her have [it] would have been hideous. [The abortion] made sense for the character."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paskin|first=Willa Paskin|title=Shonda Rhimes on Grey's Anatomy's Recent Abortion Story Line|url=http://www.vulture.com/2011/09/shonda_rhimes_talks_about_grey.html|work=New York magazine|accessdate=September 10, 2012|date=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing his onscreen relationship with Yang, McKidd said: "It's not going to be easy for them. What I read when I read the season premiere, and this is just my take on it, is that it was very much two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar in a way, I think, as people. Two analytical people see each other over a crowded ER room and their eyes meet."&lt;ref name=buddytv&gt;{{cite web|author=Debbie|title=Exclusive Interview: Kevin McKidd of 'Grey's Anatomy|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/greys-anatomy/exclusive-interview-kevin-mcki-24613.aspx|publisher=BuddyTV|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the topic of Yang's triumphs and challenges in the eighth season, Oh said: "It has been an extremely challenging year that has had a lot of ups and downs, both challenging and exhilarating. We would shoot all our scenes for a day or two straight, and that was extremely challenging because emotionally and physically it becomes really exhausting."&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/emmys-2012-greys-anatomy-sandra-oh-339356 |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |title='Grey's Anatomy's' Sandra Oh on Cristina's Emotional Season |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=June 25, 2012 |accessdate=September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oh said of Yang's expressions of emotions during season eight: "You see her express her emotions with only two people: her best friend Meredith and her husband Owen. To see someone being pulled apart so intensely, which honestly most everyone goes through in their life in some ways, if you're lucky you're completely pulled apart and then you have to pull yourself together, which hopefully will be the exploration within hopefully the next season."&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter" /&gt; Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'': "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon."&lt;ref name=bettersoon&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|title='Grey's Anatomy' Postmortem: Kevin McKidd Warns of Tougher Times Ahead for Cristina|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/greys-anatomy-kevin-mckidd-owen-cristina-spoilers-300619|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=March 15, 2012|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isaiah Washington.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Isaiah Washington]]'s character's relationship with Yang was positively received.]]
The character was well received by the critics at the time of its inception and as the series  went on the reviews became increasingly positive and Cristina went on the become an iconic character not just for Grey's but for television itself.

The relation between Meredith and Cristina has been acclaimed and been a highlight of the show. Mark Perigard of the [[Boston Herald]] considered the friendship to be "the secret core of Grey's". Aisha Harris of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' called their relation ''The Best Female Friendship on TV'' adding that "With those two characters, showrunner Shonda Rhimes and her team of writers created one of the most nuanced and realistic portrayals of female friendship on television."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/05/14/grey_s_anatomy_season_finale_ends_meredith_and_cristina_s_friendship_the.html|title=The Best Female Friendship on TV Is About to End|journal=Slate|first=Aisha|last=Harris|date=14 May 2014|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samantha Highfill of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called Cristina and Meredith the best female friends on TV because "they don't try to be". There's nothing fake about them, which is a rarity in how female friends are portrayed on television. She further went on to call them 'soulmates', "And even though they'd never dare get sappy enough to say it, they're soul mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/05/14/greys-anatomy-meredith-cristina/|title='Grey's Anatomy': Mer and Cristina are the best female friends on TV|author=|date=|website=ew.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Lyons of [[Vulture|''Vulture'' (magazine)]] called the friendship "dream BFF relationship." and the primary focus of the show, "One of the series' calling cards has been its depiction of female friendship and particularly the primacy that friendship enjoyed over romantic relationships."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/12/meredith-cristina-greys-anatomy-fight.html|title=The Year's Best Fight: Meredith and Cristina on Grey's Anatomy|author=|date=27 December 2013|website=vulture.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[E!]]'' at the time of [[Sandra Oh]]'s exit wrote, "In ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''{{'}}s 10-year history, the doctor duo has been through a lot together: weddings, deaths, plane crashes, bomb threats, shooting, you name it, they've lived (and danced) through it." and added, "And with the three words, ''"You're my person."'' Cristina Yang and [[Meredith Grey]] solidified their status as the small screen's best best friends ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/538821/grey-s-anatomy-we-dare-you-not-to-cry-during-this-tribute-to-cristina-and-meredith-s-epic-friendship|title=Grey's' Emotional Tribute to the Best Friendship on TV!|author=|date=2014-05-06|website=eonline.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:"A Country Genji by a Fake Murasaki" - Nise Murasaki inaka Genji.ehon.series.volume..cover.testscan.02.jpg|thumb|right|Cover &amp; back of 2 bound-together volumes from the gōkan ''e-hon'' series - ''[[Nise Murasaki inaka Genji|Nise Murasaki inaka Genj/A Country Genji]], by an Imitation Murasaki''. Published in 38(?) chapters, it was a parody-reworking of [[The Tale of Genji|Genji Monogatari/The Tale of Genji]].  The series ran, in original release, from 1829 to 1842. Author:  Ryūtei Tanehiko, Illustrator:  [[Utagawa Kunisada]]]]

'''''E-hon''''' or '''''Ehon''''' (絵本) is the Japanese term for [[picture book]]s. It may be applied in the general sense, or may refer specifically to a type of illustrated volume published from at least the mid-[[Edo period]] onwards, often as [[chapter book|chapter-books]] in series. In English, it is this second usage which is the more common, i.e.: ''Japanese picture-books'' of a specific format (and produced in the traditional manner).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

''E-hon'' were traditionally produced as woodblock prints on thin washi paper (printed on one side only, then folded in half, creating a "leaf" with printing on both sides), bound together (right-to-left page order) with a simple external threaded binding; typically black (sumi) ink on white paper, often with polychromatic cover designs &amp; sometimes with (usually more limited) internal colouring.  Extremely popular during the late Edo-[[Meiji era]]. The modern Japanese [[manga]] format was created as a combination of ''ehon'' chapter-books with western-style [[comic book]]s.   

''E-hon'' production was a significant part of the Japanese publishing industry (particularly) during the 19th century; most [[woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese woodblock print]] [[Schools of ukiyo-e artists|artists]] of the period produced ''e-hon'' designs (often in large quantities), as commercial work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/explore/dgexplore.cfm |title=NYPL Digital Gallery &amp;#124; Explore All Collections |publisher=Digitalgallery.nypl.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the publication of ''e-hon'' dates back as far as the [[Muromachi Period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dharma Wonder Boy|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2681/|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Toward the end of the 19th century, ''e-hon'' chapter-books were eclipsed in popularity by the new "western" concept of literary magazines.  These were larger books which contained more, and a wider range of material per-issue, but usually fewer pictures (measured on a text-to-images ratio).  They often used more modern printing methods; the increase in production costs was offset by increased efficiency, larger-scale printing and distribution, and the introduction of advertising.  Typically, a magazine would include one large folded, polychrome illustration referencing some "feature" story in the volume, as a frontispiece.  Such pictures, woodblock-printed in colour, are known as [[kuchi-e]].  The new format also absorbed most of the remaining talent and market for ukiyo-e style prints.

'''eBaum's World''' is a humor/entertainment website that is part of the Literally Media family (Cheezburger, Failblog, Memebase, I Can Has Cheezburger, Know Your Meme). The content of the site is mostly collections of funny images, memes, viral videos, and articles on Internet culture and gaming. The majority of the content on the site is submitted by their large user base, and the users are paid through a monetary point system "eBones."

==History of ownership==
eBaum's World is a website that originated in [[Rochester, New York]] featuring entertainment media such as [[video]]s, [[Adobe Flash]] [[cartoon]]s, and [[browser game|web games]]. The site was created and owned by Eric "eBaum" Bauman and his secretary and father, Neil. They sold the site to ZVUE Corporation in August 2008 for $15 million cash and $2.5 million in stock, with further payouts upon performance.&lt;ref name="zvue"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://corporate.zvue.com/news/20070802.php|title=HandHeld Entertainment to Acquire eBaum’s World, a Premier Online Entertainment Site|date=2007-08-02|accessdate=2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2009, Bauman reported that ZVUE fired him and the rest of the staff. The Headquarters were moved to San Francisco where they worked out of the ZVUE offices.

eBaum's World is owned and operated by Literally Media, which also owns Cheezburger ([[Failblog]], [[Memebase]], [[I Can Has Cheezburger?]]) and [[Know Your Meme]].

==Features==
The site features individual celebrity [[soundboard (flash)|soundboard]]s, where users can click buttons to hear quotes or phrases spoken by that celebrity. By pressing certain buttons in an organized order, users can simulate the celebrities saying unusual things.

There is a [[chatroom]], and a store which sells eBaum merchandise. There is also a section called "Moron Mail" which features feedback sent in by users.

eBaum's World has a very large collection of prank and comedic photos which are divided into signs, Photoshop images, and misleading croppings of normal pictures, etc.

This site also has a large collection of Flash movies and games from across the internet. Some of the more famous ones are [[Peanut Butter Jelly Time]] (despite the creator's explicit statements that he does not want it hosted on eBaum's World&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.10/ebaum.html |title=Wired 14.10: Dude, That Is So Not Funny |publisher=Wired.com |date=2009-01-04 |accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Badger Badger Badger]].

==Copyright infringement and controversy==
eBaum's World has garnered controversy in different Internet communities over the years due to numerous incidents of content being taken from other sites (such as [[YTMND]], [[Something Awful]], [[Albino Blacksheep]], [[4chan]], [[Olde English (sketch comedy)|Olde English]], [[Weebl's Stuff]], and [[Newgrounds]]) without attribution. Companies such as [[Viacom]]&lt;ref name="courttv.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/news/cow/022603_prankcalls_ctv.html |title=court TV becomes truTV |publisher=Courttv.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030306095852/http://www.courttv.com/news/cow/022603_prankcalls_ctv.html |archivedate=2003-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have claimed that the Baumans have infringed on their copyrights as well. Eric Bauman denies critics' claims that the site's content is stolen, citing research done by site editors and the consent form that must accompany uploads of material. He claims to honor all requests to remove unauthorized material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ebaumsworld.com/response-01-10-05.html |title=Funny Videos, Funny Pictures, Flash Games, Jokes |publisher=Ebaumsworld.com |date=2009-12-13 |accessdate=2009-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831234504/http://www.ebaumsworld.com/response-01-10-05.html |archivedate=2009-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline===
*As early as 2003, Eric Bauman had been threatened by legal action by corporations, citing unauthorized use of trademarked names or copyrighted material. One notable case involved the "soundboards" and the audio used within them.&lt;ref name="courttv.com"/&gt;
*Since November 2005, several arguments between eBaum's World forum members and Something Awful forum members have occurred concerning the posting of "Photoshop Phriday" images on eBaum's World without permission.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
*In January 2006, an animated image titled "[[Lindsay Lohan]] Doesn't Change Facial Expressions" was lifted from YTMND.com and posted at eBaum's World with the latter site's watermark superimposed. The incident touched off a feud between the two sites, resulting in eBaum's World removing the animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.ytmnd.com/EBaum%27s_World |title=EBaum's World - YTMND wiki, explaining the Internets one article at a time |publisher=Wiki.ytmnd.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On May 26, 2006, several images from the Something Awful forums were displayed on the eBaum's World website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.somethingawful.com/index.php?a=3089 |title=Mixed-up Movies |publisher=Somethingawful.com |date=2005-07-29 |accessdate=2009-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111185253/http://www.somethingawful.com/index.php?a=3089 |archivedate=2006-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Unreliable source?|date=January 2009}} The images on eBaum's World were cropped to remove the Something Awful watermark. The page was removed later in the day following multiple complaints being expressed on the eBaum's World forums. As a result, Something Awful switched to a more invasive [[Digital watermarking|watermark]] template.
*On June 12, 2006, Steven Lerner of Albino Blacksheep explained that eBaum's World took the popular Flash animation "Animator vs. Animation", and the creator of the Flash animation, [[Alan Becker]], would take legal action against eBaum's World.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alanbecker.deviantart.com |title=alanbecker on deviantART |publisher=Alanbecker.deviantart.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albino Blacksheep has also threatened legal action and claims that other websites have also asserted difficulties with Eric Bauman. Lerner and Becker used the MochiBot Flash tracking tool to track who used the animation on their web sites. Lerner also explained that the Flash animation is legally protected under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] of 1998. Furthermore, when the flash was posted on eBaum's World, it had been decompiled and the line "Hosted on albinoblacksheep.com" was removed. On June 9, Bauman sent Becker a $250 check as well as entering him into a monthly "contest" (of which Becker was the [[de facto]] winner) in hopes of having any legal charges dropped. Becker was also told to submit a pre-written statement claiming that none of eBaum's World's content was stolen, and that Bauman had contacted him prior to his content being posted on the site. Alan accepted this proposal, and later submitted this letter of apology to the Flash community of Albino Blacksheep:

{{bq|1=Hello, I am the author of Animator vs. Animation...

I feel so ashamed, and the world is ashamed of me.

I fell into eBaum's trap. I gave them fuel to fight back.

With their constant persuasion and offers for money, they made me write a quote saying that everything was fine. Of course everything was fine for me, because I had the money they had given me. What can you expect, I was dead poor before, I have no experience with business. The quote says they contacted me before they posted my animation on their website, however I did not give them permission to put it on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/archive/june2006 |title=June 2006 &amp;#124; Archive |publisher=Albinoblacksheep.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2006, eBaum's World removed the animation and the apology from Becker from their web site.

*On July 9, 2006, eBaum's World hosted an animation called "Dumb Dinosaur", originally found on Albino Blacksheep and Spinnerdisc.com. They subsequently removed the animation, and issued this apologetic statement to Drew Mokris, creator of Dumb Dinosaur:
{{bq|1=Mr. Mokris,

We were recently contacted by a fan of yours in regards to the July 9th post on your website declaring that you did not give us permission to feature your flash animation. First off, I apologize for the mixup, your flash was submitted to us via our upload form and our clearance dept's initial review led us to believe it was submitted by the original author. I have removed the animation from the system, although it may take a few hours for the changes to be reflected for all users. Once again, my apologies for the mixup, and keep up the good work, we are big fans of your animations!}}

It went on to issue him a draft notice to join Eric's program for Flash animators to put eBaum's World logos in all their animations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

eBaum's World has had a weekly segment on ABC-Disney's [[Right This Minute]] called "Real or Fake" since July 2012. Each week longtime eBaum's World editor MacDreidel brings three video clips that are viewed, discussed and ultimately voted on by the show's hosts to determine if the video is a real viral video, or a staged fake.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rightthisminute.com/videos/real-or-fake] - ''Real or Fake''&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV series attempt===
On January 24, 2006, [[USA Network]] made a deal with the [[Fox Television Studios]] to create a television program based on eBaum's World. Producers described it as a late-night companion special to air with ''[[WWE Raw]]'' featuring clips from the website, as well as new and exclusive content including interviews with former and current eBaum's World subjects. The Show was to feature former [[TechTV]] Host [[Martin Sargent]] of Unscrewed and professional wrestler [[Chris Jericho]]. The show was being executive produced by Simon Andreae through his production company, The Incubator, in association with Fox Television Studios. The [[cease and desist]] letters from this company were removed when this show was announced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050303004436/http://www.ebaumsworld.com/grapefall-legal.html Web.archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Glasgow School of Art''' ('''GSA''') is [[Scotland]]'s only [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public]] self-governing [[art school]] offering university-level programmes and research in [[architecture]], [[fine art]] and [[design]].

The school is housed in a number of buildings in the centre of [[Glasgow]], the most famous of which was designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh in phases between 1896-1909. The Mackintosh Building, which became one of the city's iconic landmarks, was severely damaged by fires in May 2014 and June 2018.&lt;ref name="guardian-2018-fire"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carrell |first1=Severin |last2=Brooks |first2=Libby |last3=Rawlinson |first3=Kevin |title='Heartbreaking': fire guts Glasgow School of Art for the second time |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/16/firefighters-tackle-blaze-at-glasgow-school-of-art |accessdate=16 June 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1845 as the '''Glasgow Government School of Design''', the school changed its name to The Glasgow School of Art in 1853. It was first located at 12 Ingram Street and moved to the [[McLellan Galleries]] in 1869. 

In 1897, work began on a new building to house the school on Renfrew Street, funded by a donation of £10,000 from the Bellahouston Trust, left from the will of [[Moses Stevens of Bellahouston]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mackintosh-architecture.gla.ac.uk/catalogue/name/?nid=BellaTru&lt;/ref&gt; The building was designed by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], chosen for the commission by the school's director, [[Francis Henry Newbery|Francis Newbery]], who oversaw a period of expansion and fast-growing reputation. The first half of the building was completed in 1899 and the second half in 1909.

The School's campus has grown since that time and in 2009 an international architectural competition was held to find an architect-led design team who would develop the Campus Masterplan and design the Phase 1 building. The competition was won by New York-based [[Steven Holl]] Architects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenholl.com |title=Steven Holl Architects |publisher=Stevenholl.com |date=7 February 2014 |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; working with Glasgow-based JM Architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmarchitects.net/|title=jmarchitects|work=jmarchitects.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reid Building was completed in 2014 and sits opposite the now destroyed Mackintosh Building on a site previously occupied by the Foulis, Assembly and Newbery Tower Buildings.

The school has produced most of Scotland's leading contemporary artists including, since 2005, 30 per cent of [[Turner Prize]] nominees and four recent Turner Prize winners: [[Simon Starling]] in 2005, [[Richard Wright (artist)|Richard Wright]] in 2009, [[Martin Boyce]] in 2011 and [[Duncan Campbell (artist)|Duncan Campbell]] in 2014. The School of Architecture is highly rated by the architecture profession&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graduatearchitecture.com/ARCHSCHOOLS/archschools_en.html |title=World's Best Architecture Schools and Universities – Top 10 List |publisher=Graduatearchitecture.com |date= |accessdate=15 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130216043303/http://www.graduatearchitecture.com/ARCHSCHOOLS/archschools_en.html |archivedate=16 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the School of Design has been described by [[Design Week]] as "leaders in design education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow School of Art|url=http://www.fulbright.org.uk/about/partner-with-us/fulbright-partners/glasgow-school-of-art|work=Fulbright Partners|publisher=The US-UK Fulbright Commission|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School is organised into five academic schools, the [[Mackintosh School of Architecture]] (named after Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who is also the GSA's most revered alumnus), the School of Design, the School of Fine Art, the School of Simulation and Visualisation (formerly the Digital Design Studio), specialising in digital and virtual technologies was launched in October 2016. The Innovation School was launched in September 2017. GSA also has a long-established portfolio of non-degree art and design classes for children and adults delivered through GSA Open Studio.

Disciplines include [[fine-art photography]] (founded by [[Thomas Joshua Cooper]] in 1982); [[painting]] and [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]] and [[environmental art]], [[product design]], [[Design engineering|product-design engineering]], [[textile design]], [[fashion design]], [[silversmithing]] and [[jewellery design]], [[interior design]], [[communication design]], [[interaction design]], and [[Architectural theory|architecture]].

===2014 fire===
[[File:Wfm glasgow school of art.jpg|thumb|right|The façade of the Mackintosh building after the fire of 2014]]
The original Mackintosh building was severely damaged by fire on 23 May 2014.&lt;ref name="BBC-fight-to-save"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-27541883 |title=Glasgow School of Art: Fire crews battle to save building |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/23/glasgow-school-of-art-fire-library|title=Glasgow School of Art fire  brought under control|date=23 May 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initial fire service estimate was that 90 per cent of the building and 70 per cent of its contents had been saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-27553056 |title=Glasgow School of Art: Fire crews save most of building |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire, which began in the basement, quickly spread upwards and, although it was brought under control quite quickly, significant damage was done to the historic studios and stairways. The renowned Mackintosh library was destroyed; the archive was water damaged, but was able to be air and freeze dried. There were no reported casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-27556659 |title=Glasgow School of Art fire: Iconic library destroyed |publisher=BBC News|date= |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fire broke out as students were preparing for their Degree Show. Eyewitnesses said that the fire appeared to have started when a projector exploded in the basement of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh building just before 12:30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name="BBC-fight-to-save" /&gt;&lt;ref name=stv-2014-fire&gt;{{cite web|title=Firefighters battle major blaze at Mackintosh Glasgow School of Ar|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/276365-rennie-mackintosh-glasgow-school-of-art-on-fire/|work=STV News|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators later determined that the cause was not a faulty projector, but "a canister of expanding foam" used in close proximity to a hot projector, causing flammable gases to ignite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow School of Art blaze: Report says foam canister caused fire|author=Reevel Alderson, Home affairs correspondent, BBC Scotland|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-30214533#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper, the use of aerosol cans is against school policy. The report from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service found that the design of the building contributed greatly to the spread of the fire: "the number of timber lined walls and voids, and original ventilation ducts running both vertically and horizontally throughout the building" as well as "a vertical service void", which "ran the entire height of the building … [and] allowed flames, hot gases, and smoke to travel". [[Fire damper| Fire and smoke dampers]], which are intended to prevent the spread of fire and smoke through ducts, had not been [[Retrofitting|retrofitted]]. In addition, an intended "fire suppression system" for the building had not been completed. A school staff member was on hand when the blaze first ignited, but was unable to contain the fast-spreading flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow School of Art fire a 'freak accident'|author=CRAIG BROWN|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/glasgow-school-of-art-fire-a-freak-accident-1-3616895|publisher=The Scotsman: Scotland on Sunday|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Restoration ====
A careful restoration process began soon after the fire; work on restoring and recreating the Mackintosh design, including the famous library interior, started in 2016.&lt;ref name="SheaRestoration"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shea|first1=Christopher|title=Restoring a Charles Rennie Mackintosh Architectural Gem From the Ashes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/arts/design/restoring-a-charles-rennie-mackintosh-architectural-gem-from-the-ashes.html?_r=0|accessdate=12 July 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restoration was performed with historical accuracy, including the use of original wood species such as [[longleaf pine]] and [[tulipwood]].&lt;ref name="BrooksRestoration"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=Libby|title=Glasgow School of Art's library restoration begins in earnest|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/24/glasgow-school-of-art-mackintosh-library-fire-restoration-begins-in-earnest|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MackintoshRestoration"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mackintosh at the Glasgow School of Art|url=https://www.longleaflumber.com/the-mackintosh-at-the-glasgow-school-of-art/|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 fire===
A large fire broke out in the Mackintosh Building on 15 June 2018, causing extensive damage. Emergency services received the first call at 11:19&amp;nbsp;pm BST, and 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were dispatched to the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/world/europe/uk-fire-glasgow-school-of-art.html|title=Glasgow Jewel Goes Up in Flames for Second Time in 4 Years|publisher=Ny Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; No casualties were reported. {{As of|2018|June|18|alt=The cause of the fire is not yet known.}}&lt;ref name="guardian-2018-fire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glasgow fire: Major blaze ravages art school's Mackintosh Building |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-44504659 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Murray &amp; Alan Dunlop Architects|Alan Dunlop]], visiting professor of architecture at [[Robert Gordon University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.e-architect.co.uk/aberdeen/scott-sutherland-rgu-glasgow|title=Scott Sutherland Aberdeen: School of Architecture - e-architect|date=2010-01-30|work=e-architect|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; who studied at the Mackintosh School of Architecture, was contacted by the press immediately after the fire and stated: "I can’t see any restoration possible for the building itself. It looks totally destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/16/glasgow-school-of-art-may-be-beyond-repair-after-fire|title=Glasgow School of Art may be beyond repair after second fire |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view was not supported by the early external building surveys, which appeared to indicate that much of the exterior had survived, though extensively damaged. Drone footage enabled a clearer assessment of the extent of the interior damage, and a programme of partial dismantling was established to stabilise the portions of the facade at risk of collapse, notably the south elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gsapress.blogspot.com/2018/07/news-release-work-begins-to-dismantle.html|title=Work begins to dismantle dangerous sections of the Mackintosh Building|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Glasgow City Council]] spokesperson said: "There is a consensus emerging that the intention of the building control people, HES ([[Historic Environment Scotland]]) people and the art school is to save the building... Right now, people are operating on the understanding it will be saveable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/18/shell-of-glasgow-school-of-art-building-may-be-saved-from-demolition|title=Glasgow School of Art building expected to be saved from demolition|last=|first=|date=18 June 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also noted by Roger Billcliffe that “It has been voted Britain’s most important building several times over, and we have all of the information needed to recreate every detail, following extensive laser surveys after the first fire."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/19/bulldoze-or-rebuild-architects-at-odds-over-future-of-glasgow-school-of-art|title=Bulldoze or rebuild?

The first opportunity for the school administration to visit the site happened on 19 June 2018. [[Muriel Gray]], Chair of the Board of Governors, stated: "This was the first opportunity for the expert team to see the building and begin what will be a long and complex process of determining the future of the Mack, but we remain optimistic. There is a huge desire to see Mackintosh’s masterpiece rise again, one which we all share. We have incredibly detailed information on the building collated over the last 4 years, and have worked with teams of talented craftspeople who were doing a tremendous job on the restoration."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/about-gsa/key-information/mackintosh-building-fire-15-june-2018/|title=Statement from the GSA 19 June 2018 - Work to assess the condition of the Mackintosh Building underway|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent statement to the BBC, Professor Tom Inns, director of the school, affirmed that "This building is not beyond saving. It will be saved in some form." He continued to support his firm belief that the building should continue in its function as a working art school, rather than a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-44530694|title=Fire-ravaged art school 'will be saved'|date=2018-06-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Risk factors====

At the time of the fire, [[Fire sprinkler system|sprinklers]] had yet to be installed in the building. Components for the fire suppression system had been delivered the day before, but were weeks away from assembly and testing. Building control officers have expressed concerns that the end walls may collapse. The building remains cordoned off and affected residents have been offered accommodation by Glasgow City Council.&lt;ref name="BBCSprinklers"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-44592882 |accessdate = 24 June 2018 | work = BBC News | date = 24 June 2018 | title = Glasgow School of Art fire safety system 'was weeks away' |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2018 it was announced that work is being planned to take down parts of the building that are in danger of collapse. Compensation for local residents and businesses will be made available by the Scottish Government.&lt;ref name="BBCDismantle"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-44497880 |accessdate = 28 June 2018 | work = BBC News | date = 28 June 2018 | title = Glasgow School of Art in danger of 'sudden collapse' |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2018, Glasgow School of Art terminated its £25 million restoration contract with Kier following the Mackintosh Building fire.

==Campus==
[[File:gsa westernfacade.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The western façade of the Mackintosh building]]
The school currently has two separate campuses: the School of Fine Art, Digital Culture, and MFA programmes are in the vicinity of the Mackintosh building. The School of Design – Textiles, Jewellery &amp; Silversmithing, Product Design Engineering, Product Design, Communication Design and Interior Design – the Centre for Advanced Textiles, Design Innovation Studio and the Where the Monkey Sleeps cafe have recently{{when|date=August 2018}} moved back to the Garnethill Campus with the occupation of the new Reid Building.

The Institute of Design Innovation (InDI), a research centre of the School of Design is based in Forres and the school has a Representative Office in Beijing, PRC. The GSA has a specialist research and postgraduate centre, [[Digital Design Studio]] (DDS), based on the southside of Glasgow in a new facility at [[Pacific Quay]] by the [[River Clyde]] in a building called The Hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hub-pq.com/home.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910023225/http://www.hub-pq.com/home.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-09-10|title=Graphic Design Agency / Brand Consultants Midlands – Alt Design|work=Alt Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mackintosh Building was the heart of the campus and continued to be a functioning part of the school until the first major fire on 23 May 2014. The building housed the [[Fine Art]] Painting department, first year studios and administrative staff. It houses the Mackintosh gallery which held many different exhibitions throughout the year. The Mackintosh Gallery (also known as the Mackintosh Museum) was the only part of the Mackintosh building open to the general public; all other areas of the school were only viewable by guided tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CathieRandall |url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/tours |title=Tours |publisher=Gsa.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exception to this rule was the Degree Show where all the studios within the Mackintosh building were opened to allow people to view the graduating year's final artworks. Since the fire of May 2014 the School of Fine Art has been temporarily housed in a campus at the Tontine Building, [[Merchant City]], Glasgow &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/visual/13412640.GSA_degree_show_takes_root_in_the_Trongate/|title=GSA Degree Show takes root in Trongate|last=|first=|date=2015|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Mackintosh Building underwent restoration and the newly acquired Stow Building is refurbished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/support-gsa/mackintosh-campus-appeal/|title=Mackintosh Campus Appeal|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=The Glasgow School of Art|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Glasgow_art_architecture.jpg|alt=|thumb|A model of the GSA]]
The Richmond Building houses the Fine Art Photography department. The Mackintosh School of Architecture and the school's library and learning resources are situated in The Bourdon Building. The Barnes Building on West Graham Street is the base for the Sculpture and Environmental Art, International Foundation and Interaction Design programmes.

An international architectural competition was launched in March 2009 to find the design team to prepare a campus masterplan and detailed design of the first new building phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitecture.com/news/read/GSA+launches+international+search+for+architects|title=Scottisharchitecture.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the competition was Steven Holl Architects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waite |first=Richard |url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/steven-holl-unveils-glasgow-school-of-art-mackintosh-designs/5207716.article |title=Steven Holl unveils Glasgow School of Art Mackintosh designs |publisher=Architects Journal |date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; working in partnership with Glasgow’s JM Architects and Arup Engineering. Work commenced in 2011 and continued until 2013. The building was structurally complete in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/glasgow_school_of_art_competition.php|title=Glasgow School of Art Competition – Extension Building|work=Glasgow Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new building has been named the Reid Building after the last Director: Dame [[Seona Reid]], and won Building of the Year at the 2014 Architect's Journal awards – the AJ100 Awards in May 2014, and the Award for Arts or Entertainment Structures at the [[IStructE]]'s 2014 [[Structural Awards]].

==Singapore Campus==
Since September 2012, the GSA has delivered years 3 and 4 of its Bachelor of Arts (Hons) Programmes in Communication Design and Interior Design in Singapore, in partnership with the [[Singapore Institute of Technology]] (SIT), based at the [[Temasek Polytechnic]] Campus in Tampines.
The programmes enable Diploma students from the Singapore Polytechnics to progress from a Diploma to a BA (Hons) degree. 
Students studying in Singapore benefit from the same programme of study and award as in the home institution, along with resources and equipment according to the GSA specifications.

==Students==
The GSA has been ranked in the top 10 of specialist educational institutions in ''[[The Guardian]]'' University Guide, ranking it the top specialist visual arts institution in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2011/may/17/universityguide |title=University guide 2012: Specialist institutions league table |date=17 May 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its degrees are validated by the [[University of Glasgow]]. Of its 1,900 students, almost 20 per cent are international, 20 per cent from the rest of the UK and approximately 20 per cent are postgraduate.

In 2002 the funding councils published figures which placed Glasgow School of Art as having the second-lowest number of students from a working-class background out of a list of UK higher education institutions. With 7 per cent of its students coming from social classes IIIm, IV and V (skilled manual, semi-skilled or un-skilled workers), the figures put it above Oxford and Cambridge in terms of exclusivity. Glasgow School of art disputed the figures, explaining that the majority of its applicants did not come through the [[UCAS]] system on which the statistics were based so the numbers involved were very small. This was reinforced by [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|HEFCE]], which said the figures should be treated with care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacLeod|first=Donald|title=Glasgow 'posher' than Oxbridge|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/dec/18/accesstouniversity.highereducation|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=18 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the Commission on Widening Access (CoWA) found the percentage of Scottish-domiciled full-time first degree entrants from SIMD 20 (20 per cent most deprived areas of Scotland) at the GSA was 22.2 per cent. This is the second highest in Scotland, according to CoWA's report, with only [[University of the West of Scotland]] having more.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Widening Access – Technical paper on measures and targets, p11, Annex A (14 Mar 2016) [http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0049/00496620.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The Glasgow School of Art is host to a number of high-profile research projects, funded primarily through the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]], the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]], and the [[Economic and Social Research Council]], although other UK research councils have funded projects in the past.

At the last [[Research Assessment Exercise]] in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://results.ref.ac.uk/Results/ByHei/95|title=REF2014 results by institution/Glasgow School of Art|last=|first=|date=2014|website=results.ref.ac.uk|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the GSA had the largest art and design research community in Scotland and with 23 per cent of research evaluated as world leading. The GSA has a number of research centres including the Digital Design Studio, Mackintosh Environmental Architectural Research Unit, Institute of Design Innovation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/55365510 |title=Institute of Design Innovation on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=11 December 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centre for Advanced Textiles and the Glasgow Urban Lab&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ScottParsons |url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/research/research-centres/ |title=Research Centres |publisher=Gsa.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
The school runs an annual public programme of exhibitions and events. The Reid Gallery has a curated programme that works with contemporary artists, designers and architects; and GSA staff and students, and makes connections to the heritage and architecture of the Glasgow School of Art and its collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/life/gsa-events|title=GSA Events|date=|publisher=Gsa.ac.uk|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''itinerant poet''' or '''strolling minstrel''' (also known variously as a '''gleeman''', '''circler''', or '''cantabank''') was a wandering [[minstrel]], [[bard]], or other [[poet]] common in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Europe]] but extinct today. From a lower class than [[jester]]s or [[jongleur]]s because he did not have steady work, he instead roamed about to make his living.&lt;ref name=BahnBahn1970&gt;{{Cite book |title = A History of Oral Interpretation |last = Bahn |first = Eugene |chapter= Medieval Period |publisher = Burgess Publishing Co. |year = 1970 |isbn = |location = Minneapolis |pages = 56–57 |first2 = Margaret |last2 = Bahn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gleeman ==
In [[Medieval England]], a gleeman was a reciter of poetry. Like the [[scop]], the gleeman performed poetry to the accompaniment of the harp or "glee wood".&lt;ref name=BahnBahn1970 /&gt; The gleeman occasionally attached himself to a single/particular court but was most often a ''wandering'' entertainer, unlike the scop, who was more static. A gleeman was also less likely to compose or perform his own poetry and relied on the work of others for his material.&lt;ref name=BahnBahn1970 /&gt;

'''Karl Mayländer''' (died early 1940s) was a Jewish businessman and [[art collector]] who was deported from Vienna to Lodz, in German occupied Poland, by the Nazis during the Second World War and later died in the Holocaust.

Mayländer was an art collector and critic who was a member of the board of the Volksheim Ottakring (later the [[Volkshochschule Ottakring]]), an adult education school which also hosted art exhibitions. Mayländer acquired the work of many young Austrian artists, including many drawings by [[Egon Schiele]] whom he knew personally.&lt;ref&gt;''Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky collections''. Prestel Publishing, 2005. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art by Schiele owned by Mayländer has been the subject of restitution claims by his descendant in New York, Eva Zirkl, and in 2016 the [[Leopold Museum]] in Vienna agreed to return two watercolour paintings by Schiele to Zirkl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.at/20160407/austrian-museum-returns-nazi-plundered-artwork Austrian museum returns Nazi plundered artwork.] The Local/AFP, 7 April 2016.

==Early life==
Lindsay Errington was born in Edinburgh and trained as a painter at the [[Camberwell School of Art]] in London but did not follow that as a career. She studied art history at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] and later completed a PhD there&lt;ref name=herald&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/11993794.Ambassador_for_Scotland_apos_s_art_heritage/ Ambassador for Scotland's art heritage.] ''The Herald'', originally published 2nd February 1989. Retrieved 2 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject of "Social and religious themes in English Art" (1973). It was published in book form by Garland in 1984 in their [[Outstanding theses from the Courtauld Institute of Art]] series.

==Career==
Errington taught at the Newcastle College of Art but did not find the work to her liking, preferring to be in Scotland, and was appointed to a curatorial post at the National Gallery of Scotland in 1972, only the second woman to hold such a post. She was asked to look after the Scottish paintings, which her male colleagues did not think an honour, but which she was delighted to do.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; She was at the gallery for over 20 years where she worked to establish a representative collection of [[Scottish art]]&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; and produced many of the monographs on Scottish artists in the Scottish Masters series.

In 1988-89 she was [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoart.cam.ac.uk/aboutthedept/sladeprofs/sladeprofs/le456@cam.ac.uk Lindsay Errington.] Department of History of Art, University of Cambridge. Retrieved 2 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; when she was the first Slade professor to lecture on Scottish art.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt;

In 2017, Errington published her most recent book, ''Private Views'', which featured images from the National Gallery's collection with verses composed in response to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthistorynews.com/articles/4661_Art_and_poetry_ctd Art and poetry.] Art History News, 26 May 2017.

'''Magda Sawon''' is a [[Contemporary art gallery|contemporary art gallerist]] and art world figure who founded and owns New York's [[Postmasters Gallery]] (with her husband Tamas Banovich), a gallery for young and established contemporary artists, especially those working in new media, in the [[Tribeca]] neighborhood of New York City.  The gallery is considered to be one of the "leading experimental galleries" in New York City.&lt;ref name=viveros-faune&gt;{{cite news|last=Viveros-Faune|first=Christian|title=How Uptown Money Kills Downtown Art|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-02-06/art/uptown-money-kills-downtown-art/3/|accessdate=3 April 2014|newspaper=The Village Voice|date=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Early career ==
Magdalena Sawon came to Manhattan from [[Poland]] in 1981, having studied art history with an emphasis in [[Japonism]] in Warsaw, earning a Master's degree.&lt;ref name="Fensterstock2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Fensterstock|title=Art on the Block: Tracking the New York Art World from SoHo to the Bowery, Bushwick and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0X83AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA271|date=17 September 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-27849-4|pages=271–}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a job in a shoe store, and emboldened by a class she took at the [[New School]] taught by Estelle Schwartz, she struck out with partner Tamas Banovich, opening an art gallery in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] on Avenue A between 4th and 5th Streets&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|last=Lanfranco|first=Katerina|title=tArt roundtable discussion with Magda Sawon at Postmasters Gallery|url=http://tartblog.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/tart-roundtable-discussion-with-magda-sawon-postmasters-gallery/|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 1984.&lt;ref name="gallery website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Postmasters Gallery|url=http://www.postmastersart.com/gallery_window.html|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name of the gallery referenced being "post" the European masters, alludes to Postmodernism, and also points to an early interest in [[mail art]] and its distribution by the postal service.&lt;ref name="Fensterstock2013" /&gt;

In 1988, Sawon and Banovich moved Postmasters Gallery to a [[Soho]] loft space at Greene and Spring Streets.&lt;ref name=interview /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Roberta|title=ART VIEW; The Gallery Is the Message|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/04/arts/art-view-the-gallery-is-the-message.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 4, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the gallery was relocated to Chelsea (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friend|first=David|title=Watching the World Change: The Stories Behind the Images of 9/11|date=2011|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9781429933155|page=251|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D3YQIY1ShFYC&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;dq=%22Magda%20Sawon%22&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tribeca in October 2013.&lt;ref name="gallery website" /&gt; Sawon lived in the East Village and Chelsea prior to her move to Soho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Claire|title=Turning the High Line Into the High Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/realestate/18cover.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Sawon sold a work from her gallery (by artists [[Jennifer &amp; Kevin McCoy|Jennifer and Kevin McCoy]]) to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], which she described as a highlight of her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joseph-Hunter|first=Galen|title=Electronic Arts Intermix - Conversation with Magda Sawon|url=http://www.eai.org/resourceguide/collection/computer/interview_sawon.html|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magical feminism''' is a subgenre of the [[magical realism]] literary genre. The term was first used in 1987 by Patricia Hart to describe the works of [[Isabel Allende]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blackwell|first1=Frieda H.|title=Narrative Magic in the Fiction of Isabel Allende by Patricia Hart|journal=Letras Femeninas|volume=17|issue=1/2|pages=140–143|jstor=23022035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Volkova, Ekaterina [https://www.academia.edu/4424017/Female_Voices_of_Magical_Realism "Female voices of magical realism"], Retrieved on 07 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent critical works on the subject feature such scholars as Ricci-James Adams or Kimberley Ann Wells. The term ''magical feminism'' refers to magical realism in a [[feminism|feminist]] discourse. Magical realism's basic assumption is the coexistence and effective merging of contradictory [[worldviews]], the scientific and rational with the spiritual and magical. It grants equal [[Ontology|ontological status]] to real figures and spirits, everyday occurrences and supernatural events. In its nature then is the subversion of monolithic cultural, social and political structures. It is a mode perfect for the writers who are ''in between'', especially the [[Post-colonialism|postcolonial]] ones.

Seen from the post-colonial perspective the magic and supernatural elements serve to disrupt reality giving voice to the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], the oppressed groups. In the case of magical feminism the role of The Other is assumed by the marginalized women.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ricci-James. [http://www.doubledialogues.com/archive/issue_six/adams.html "Magical Feminism: The Paradoxical Pain in Fefu and her Friends by Maria Irene Fornes and The Eisteddfod by Lally Katz",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019000019/http://www.doubledialogues.com/archive/issue_six/adams.html |date=2014-10-19 }} ''Anatomy and Poetics''. Issue Six, Winter 2005. Retrieved on 06 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The strategies of defamiliarization, supernaturalization, grotesque, intertextuality, are used to undermine the fossilized schemata and oppressive mechanisms of patriarchal domination and to create a space in which an independent version of identity and history can be manifested.

Magical feminism is popular among representatives of [[American literature#Minority literatures|ethnic literature of the United States]] who operate in a hybrid culture and a hybrid language. They are for example [[Ana Castillo]],&lt;ref&gt;"Ana Castillo." Poetry Foundation. Accessed December 31, 2014. http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/ana-castillo.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maria Helena Viramontes]],&lt;ref&gt;"Casebook: Viramontes Under the Feet of Jesus About the Author." Casebook: Viramontes Under the Feet of Jesus. Accessed December 31, 2014. http://performance.millikin.edu/literaturecasebooks/viramontes/biography.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kathleen Alcalá]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uapress.arizona.edu/author/kathleen-alcala|title=Kathleen  Alcalá – UAPress|website=uapress.arizona.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also female authors from other parts of the world such as British writer [[Jeanette Winterson]] or Polish author [[Olga Tokarczuk]].

[[Kimberley Ann Wells]] claims that the most important feature of this genre is the presence of a female magic user, most commonly a witch or a shamaness, metaphorically representing the female protest against the male-dominated world order and an act of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Kimberley Ann (2002).

In 2005, the [[United States Mint]] released a silver dollar [[commemorative coin]] in honor of the 230th birthday of the [[United States Marine Corps]].

The coin was sold as both as a [[proof coinage|proof coin]] and an uncirculated coin, for a total number of 600,000 coins. They became available to order on July 20, 2005, and by September 21, 2005, all coins had been purchased.

This was the first time the United States released a coin to represent a branch of its military.

== Specifications ==
The coin features one of the most recognizable scenes of Marine Corps history, ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''. Additionally, the Marine Corps official emblem, the [[Eagle, Globe, and Anchor]] is on the reverse.

'''Mintage (max.)''': 600,000
Based on independent market research provided by the recipient organization (the [[Marine Corps Heritage Foundation]]), the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary]] exercised his authority (for the first time) to increase the legislated maximum mintage (500,000) to 600,000.

'''U.S. Mint Facility''': [[Philadelphia Mint|Philadelphia]]

'''[[American administrative law|Public Law]]''': 108-291

'''Martha King''' ({{circa}}1803 &amp;ndash; 31 May 1897) was New Zealand's first resident [[botanical illustrator]]. She was a prominent figure in early [[Whanganui|Wanganui]] and [[New Plymouth]] as a founder of schools in both districts. She was a talented gardener and schoolteacher.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DNZB King" /&gt;

==Life==

Martha King was born in Ireland.&lt;ref name="DNZB King"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Martha King|first=Moira M.|last=Long|id=1k12|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She emigrated to New Zealand in December 1840, arriving at [[Wellington]] on board the [[barque]] ''[[New Zealand Company ships#London|London]]''. She travelled with her eldest sister, Maria, and her brother, Samuel Popham King.&lt;ref name="Viking 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dawson|first1=Bee|title=Lady painters: the flower painters of early New Zealand|date=1999|publisher=Viking|location=Auckland|isbn=0670886513|pages=13–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From Wellington, the Kings sailed to Wanganui on board the ''Elizabeth'', arriving on 27 February 1841, and became foundation settlers of the new town. They had purchased a section of the land acquired by Colonel [[William Wakefield]] for the [[New Zealand Company]].&lt;ref name="DNZB King" /&gt; Samuel King built two houses, and Martha King and her sister opened Wanganui's first school soon afterward. One source claims the school was popular, with the sisters balancing discipline and kindness well.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-SamEarl-t1-body1-d6.html|title=Early New Zealand Botanical Art|last=Sampson|first=F. Bruce|publisher=Reed Methuen|year=1985|isbn=|location=Auckland|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 1847, the King family moved to New Plymouth, sailing on board the ''[[Ralph Bernal]]''.&lt;ref name="DNZB King" /&gt; King opened a school with her sister, Maria, and her sister-in-law, Mary Jane King, while living in New Plymouth. This venue was also used for other functions, such as cultural activities, which reflected the Kings' prominent presence in New Plymouth's public life.&lt;ref name="DNZB King"/&gt; 

King died at her New Plymouth home on 31 May 1897, aged 94 years.&lt;ref name="Viking 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TH18970601.2.6 | title=Death | work=Taranaki Herald | date=1 June 1897 | page=1 | accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King was one of the early British and Irish settlers who turned to botanical illustration to "eke out a livelihood in rough conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/659564120|title=Ladies in the laboratory III: South African, Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian women in science: nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: a survey of their contributions|last1=Creese|first1=Mary R.

In September 1842, King was commissioned by the [[Wellington Horticultural and Botanical Society]] to prepare two sets of drawings of interesting [[Flora of New Zealand|indigenous botanical specimens]], one to be forwarded to the directors of the New Zealand Company, and the other to the [[London Horticultural Society]].&lt;ref name="Viking 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org.nz/150th-anniversary/150-women-in-150-words/1867-1917/martha-king/|title=Martha King|last=|first=|date=2017|website=royalsociety.org.nz|publisher=Royal Society Te Apārangi|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly why King was chosen for this commission is unknown.&lt;ref name="Wellington, 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last2=Eagle|first2=Audrey|last1=Brownsey|first1= Patrick|title=The essential Audrey Eagle|date=2013|publisher=Te Papa Press|location=Wellington|isbn=9781877385902|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first set of 40 watercolours was completed by January 1843, reaching the New Zealand Company in London in September 1843; it was acquired by the [[Alexander Turnbull Library]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="Wellington, 2013" /&gt; The second set has disappeared without trace.&lt;ref name="Viking 1999" /&gt;

'''Maskit''' ({{he| משכית}}) is an [[State of Israel|Israeli]] fashion house founded in 1954 by [[Ruth Dayan]], wife of [[Moshe Dayan]]. It was the country's first [[fashion house]]. Maskit produces textiles, clothing, objets d’art and jewelry.
==Etymology==
[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - A Striking Outfit.jpg|thumb|150px|Maskit dress, 1956]]
The [[Hebrew]] word "maskit," meaning an ornament, or something small and beautiful, appears in   the [[Bible]] 14 times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephdeacetis/2017/05/16/how-an-israeli-luxury-fashion-brand-transitions-to-modified-heritage/#11a310087875 How an Israeli luxury fashion brand transitions to modified heritage, [[Forbes]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ruth Dayan at maskit.jpg|thumb|Maskit founder [[Ruth Dayan]] and [[Miss Israel]] 1956, Sara Tal, with Maskit tunic]]
In the early years of the state, when the government was seeking work opportunities for [[aliyah|new immigrants]] to Israel, Ruth Dayan realized that many of them were skilled in decorative arts such as embroidery, rugs, and arts and crafts.  The concept of Maskit, which Dayan founded in 1954, was to take  modern European patterns and combine them with ethnic embroidery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/maskit-the-revamping-of-israels-first-ever-fashion-house/ Maskit: The revamping of Israel's first ever fashion house]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Dayan met fashion designer Finy Leitersdorf, who designed clothes and accessories for Maskit over a period of 15 years. The two collaborated on a joint exhibit of Maskit designs at the Dizengoff Museum (today the [[Tel Aviv Museum]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/.premium-1.559589 Breathing new life into legendary Israeli fashion brand Maskit,] [[Haaretz]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an interview in 1966, Leitersdorf spoke about the "Israeliness" of Maskit clothing. It was not just the [[Yemen]]ite embroidery, she said, but the "range of colors - the desert brown, the impure black inspired by Bedouin tents, and the eternally changing blue of the Mediterranean." She also cited the loose design, which made life more comfortable in the country's hot climate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/a-leitersdorf-showcase-1.379537 A Leitersdorf showcase, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Maskit enjoyed worldwide success in the 1960s, with clients that included [[Audrey Hepburn]]. From the 1960s to the 1980s, Maskit employed 2,000 people, with ten stores in Israel and one in New York. Maskit garments were sold by Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Fashion/McQueen-to-Maskit-The-mind-behind-the-brand-348614 McQueen to Maskit: The mind behind the brand]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The company closed in 1994 but it was reopened in 2013 by Nir and Sharon Tal, who had worked for   Deloitte and Alexander McQueen. One of the investors was Israeli businessman [[Stef Wertheimer]], founder of the industrial tool manufacturer [[Iscar]] purchased by [[Warren Buffett]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/fashion/despite-tel-aviv-bombings-the-fashion-show-goes-on.html?_r=0 Fashion despite Tel Aviv bombings: The fashion show goes on, [[New York Times]]]&lt;/ref&gt;Sharon Tal, now the company's chief designer, re-established the brand in cooperation with Dayan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Maud Kathleen Lewis''' ([[née]] '''Dowley'''; March 7, 1903 – July 30, 1970) was a Canadian [[folk artist]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metronews.ca/news/ottawa/2015/09/14/antiques-roadshow-style-open-house-comes-to-ottawa.htmlAntiques Roadshow-style drop-in comes to Ottawa Art Gallery"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''Ottawa Metro''. Haley Ritchie, Sep 14 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/the-snow-queen-takes-on-canadian-twist-1.2860425 "'The Snow Queen' takes on Canadian twist"]. ''CBC News'' Dec 04, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Nova Scotia]]. Living in poverty with her husband in a small house in [[Marshalltown, Nova Scotia]], most of her life, she achieved national recognition in 1964 and 1965. Several books, plays and films have since been produced about her. Lewis remains one of Canada's best-known folk artists. Her works and the restored Maud Lewis House are displayed in the [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]].

==Early life==
Lewis was born Maud Kathleen Dowley on March 7, 1903 in [[South Ohio, Nova Scotia|South Ohio]], Nova Scotia, the daughter of John and Agnes (Germain) Dowley.&lt;ref name="AGN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maud Lewis|url=http://www.artgalleryofnovascotia.ca/maud-lewis|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.novascotiagenealogy.com/ItemView.aspx?ImageFile=88-857&amp;Event=marriage&amp;ID=232219 Nova Scotia Historical Vital Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; She had one brother. Dowley suffered from juvenile [[rheumatoid arthritis]], which reduced her mobility, especially in her hands. Dowley was introduced to art by her mother, who instructed her in the making of watercolour Christmas cards to sell.&lt;ref name="Maud Lewis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digby County: A Journey Through Time|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/histoires_de_chez_nous-community_memories/pm_v2.php?id=story_line&amp;lg=English&amp;fl=0&amp;ex=00000443&amp;sl=8547&amp;pos=1|website=www.virtualmuseum.ca|publisher=Virtual Museum Canada|accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began her artistic career by selling hand-drawn and painted Christmas cards. 

Maud became involved with Emery Allen, also of Digby, who has been described as the love of her life. She gave birth to their daughter, Catherine Dowley, in 1928 out of wedlock. Allen abandoned Dowley and their daughter. Maud continued to live at home with her parents. It was arranged by the court for her daughter Catherine to be adopted, as Dowley had no way to support her. Later in life Catherine married Paul Muise and had her own family; they lived in Nova Scotia and Ontario. She apparently tried to contact her mother, but was not successful.&lt;ref&gt;Lance Woolaver, ''Maud Lewis: The Heart on the Door'' (Spencer Publishing, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, her father John died and in 1937, her mother Agnes died.&lt;ref name="AGN" /&gt; As was typical of the time, her brother inherited the family home. After living with her brother for a short while, Dowley moved to [[Digby, Nova Scotia]] to live with her aunt.&lt;ref name="AGN" /&gt;

==Marriage==
When Dowley was 34, she married Everett Lewis, a fish peddler from [[Marshalltown, Nova Scotia|Marshalltown]], on January 16, 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digbycourier.ca/Living/2014-06-07/article-3755305/Yarmouth-promoting-its-Maud-Lewis/1 "Yarmouth promoting its Maud Lewis"]. John DeMings, ''Digby Courier'', on June 07, 2014 &lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as the watchman at the county Poor Farm. According to Everett, Maud Dowley showed up at his door step in response to an advertisement he had posted in the local stores for a "live-in or keep house" for a forty-year-old bachelor. Several weeks later, they married.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} 

They lived in Everett's one-room house with a sleeping loft in Marshalltown, a few miles west of Digby. Maud used this house as her studio. Everett took care of the housework.&lt;ref name="The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolaver|first1=Lance|title=The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis|date=1995|publisher=Nimbus Publishing Limited|location=Halifax|isbn=1-55109-176-3|pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis and her husband lived mostly in poverty in the one-room house. After their deaths, the house was purchased by a local group. It was acquired by the province and transferred to the [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]]. They had the tiny house restored and it is now part of a permanent display on Maud Lewis and her works.

Maud Lewis accompanied her husband on his daily rounds peddling fish door-to-door, bringing along Christmas cards that she had drawn. She would sell the cards for twenty-five cents each. These cards proved popular with her husband's customers, and she began painting. Everett encouraged Lewis to paint, and he bought her her first set of oils.&lt;ref name="hamilton"/&gt;

She expanded her range, using other surfaces for painting, such as pulp boards ([[beaverboard]]s), cookie sheets, and [[Masonite]]. Lewis was a prolific artist and also painted on more or less every available surface in their tiny home: walls, doors, breadboxes, and even the stove. She completely covered the simple patterned commercial wallpaper with sinewy stems, leaves, and blossoms.&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;Laurie Hamilton, ''The Painted House of Maud Lewis'', Goose Lane Editions (2001), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paintings==
[[File:MaudeLewisMemorial.jpg|thumb|240px|Maud Lewis Memorial in [[Marshalltown, Nova Scotia|Marshalltown]]]]
Maud Lewis used bright colours in her paintings, and subjects were often flowers or animals, including oxen teams, horses, birds, deer, or cats. Many of her paintings are of outdoor scenes, including Cape Island boats bobbing on the water, horses pulling a sleigh, skaters, and portraits of dogs, cats, deer, birds, and cows. Her paintings were inspired by childhood memories of the landscape and people around [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]] and South Ohio, as well as Digby locations, such as [[Point Prim Lighthouse|Point Prim]] and Bayview. Commercial Christmas cards and calendars also influenced her. 

Most of her paintings are quite small - often no larger than eight by ten inches, although she is known to have done at least five paintings 24&amp;nbsp;inches by 36&amp;nbsp;inches. The size was limited by the extent she could move her arms, which had been affected by arthritis. She used mostly wallboard and tubes of Tinsol, an oil-based paint. Lewis' technique consisted of first coating the board with white, then drawing an outline, and applying paint directly out of the tube. She never blended or mixed colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Women's work : a selection of work by 4 significant Nova Scotia artists : Maria Morris, Alice Hagen, Maud Lewis, Suzanne Swannie.|journal=Mount Saint Vincent University. Art Gallery.|date=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Maud Lewis paintings from the 1940s are quite rare. A large collection of Lewis' work can be found in the [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]] (AGNS). The AGNS occasionally displays the Chaplin/Wennerstrom shutters (now part of the Clearwater Fine Foods Inc. collection). This collection comprises twenty-two exterior house shutters that Lewis painted in the early 1940s. The work was done for some Americans who owned a cottage on the [[Southern Nova Scotia|South Shore]]. Most of the shutters are quite large, at 5&amp;nbsp;ft x 1&amp;nbsp;ft.6&amp;nbsp;inches. Lewis was paid 70 cents a shutter.

Between 1945 and 1950, people began to stop at Lewis' Marshalltown home on [[Nova Scotia Trunk 1|Highway No. 1]], the main highway and tourist route in western Nova Scotia. They bought her paintings for two or three dollars each. Only in the last three or four years of Lewis' life did her paintings begin to sell for seven to ten dollars. She achieved national attention as a folk artist following an article in the Toronto-based ''[[Star Weekly]]'' in 1964. In 1965, she was featured on CBC-TV's ''[[Telescope (TV series)|Telescope]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube | id=ryqC0Tz5N4Q | title= '''CBC ''Telescope''''' (1965).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Lewis' paintings were ordered by the [[White House]] in the 1970s during [[Richard Nixon]]'s presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolaver|first1=Lance|title=The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis|date=1995|publisher=Nimbus Publishing/Art Gallery of Nova Scotia|isbn=1-55109-176-3|page=XVII}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, her arthritis limited her ability to complete many of the orders that had come from her national recognition. 

In the early 21st century, her paintings have sold at auction for ever increasing prices. Two of her paintings have sold for more than $16,000. The highest auction price so far is $22,200.00 for lot 196 ''A Family Outing''. The painting was sold at a Bonham's auction in Toronto on November 30, 2009. Another painting, ''A View of Sandy Cove'', sold in 2012 for $20,400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnard|first1=Elissa|title=Maud Lewis work fetches $20,000|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/201208-maud-lewis-work-fetches-20000|work=Halifax Chronicle-Herald|date=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A painting found in 2016 at an Ontario thrift store, ''Portrait of Eddie Barnes and Ed Murphy, Lobster Fishermen'', sold at auction for almost three times its estimated price. The online auction ended May 19, 2017, and the painting, which was appraised at $16,000, sold for $45,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/maud-lewis-painting-found-in-thrift-store-sells-for-45000-in-auction/article35074481/|title=Maud Lewis painting found in thrift store sells for $45,000|last=Germano|first=Daniela|date=2017-05-20|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-03-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
In the last year of her life, Maud Lewis stayed in one corner of her house, painting as often as she could while traveling back and forth to the hospital for treatment of health issues. She died in Digby on July 30, 1970 from pneumonia.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thevanguard.ca/Living/2015-08-04/article-4235517/Ferry-carried-21,000-passengers-between-Yarmouth-and-Portland-in-July-1970/1 "45 Years ago"]. ''The Vanguard''. Eric Bourque, 04 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband Everett was killed in 1979 by a burglar during an attempted robbery at the small house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolaver|first1=Lance|title=The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis|date=1995|publisher=Nimbus Publishing/Art Gallery of Nova Scotia|isbn=1-55109-176-3|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and honours==
*After Everett Lewis died, the painted house began to deteriorate. A group of concerned citizens from the Digby area started the Maud Lewis Painted House Society; their goal was to save this landmark. In 1984, the house was sold to the [[Province of Nova Scotia]] and transferred to the care of [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]] (AGNS) in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]].&lt;ref name="AGN" /&gt; The AGNS restored the house and installed it as the Maud Lewis House in the gallery, as part of a permanent Lewis exhibit.&lt;ref name="AGN" /&gt; 

*A steel memorial sculpture based on her house has been erected at the original homesite in Marshalltown. It was designed by architect [[Brian MacKay-Lyons]].&lt;ref name="replica"/&gt; 
*A replica of the Maud Lewis House was built in 1999 by retired fisherman Murray Ross, complete with finished interior. It is located a few kilometres north of Marshalltown on the road to [[Digby Neck]] in Seabrook.&lt;ref name="replica"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitehead|first1=Jeanne|title=Renewed appreciation for Maud Lewis replica|url=http://www.digbycourier.ca/Living/2008-12-03/article-610631/Renewed-appreciation-for-Maud-Lewis-replica/1|accessdate=5 March 2016|work=The Digby Courier|date=Dec 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further reading and other media==
Maud Lewis is the subject of a book by [[Lance Woolaver]], ''The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis'', and three [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentaries: ''Maud Lewis - A World Without Shadows'' (1976),&lt;ref name=withoutshadows&gt;{{cite web|title=Maud Lewis: A World Without Shadows|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/maud_lewis_a_world_without_shadows/|work=Online documentary|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=18 March 2011|format=Requires [[Adobe Flash]]|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis'' (1998), and ''I Can Make Art ... Like Maud Lewis'' (2005). The latter is a short film in which a group of Grade 6 students are inspired by Lewis' work to create their own folk art painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/i_can_make_art_like_maud_lewis|title=I Can Make Art ... Like Maud Lewis|last=Churchill|first=Jane|year=2005|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2009, the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, in conjunction with Greg Thompson Productions, produced a new play about Lewis on stage at the AGNS. ''A Happy Heart: The Maud Lewis Story'' was written and produced by Greg Thompson, who had produced ''Marilyn: Forever Blonde'' at the AGNS in January 2008. Thompson wrote the one-woman play about Lewis while in Nova Scotia in 2008. The play ran until October 25, 2009.

*Screenwriter [[Sherry White]] wrote a script for a feature dramatic film about Lewis, entitled ''[[Maudie (film)|Maudie]]'' (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maudie explores folk artist’s love for another N.S. outsider|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/1271535-maudie-explores-folk-artist%E2%80%99s-love-for-another-n.s.-outsider|work=Halifax Chronicle-Herald|date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maudie'' made its Canadian debut at the [[2016 Toronto International Film Festival]]. The film was directed by [[Aisling Walsh]], and stars [[Sally Hawkins]] as Maud and [[Ethan Hawke]] as Everett Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maudie|url=http://www.tiff.net/films/maudie/|publisher=Toronto International Film Festival|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:LouisvillePalaceFullSign.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Front view of [[The Louisville Palace]] with marquee reading "[[Tom Waits]] August 7"]]
The '''performing arts''' community in '''Louisville, Kentucky''' is undergoing a [[renaissance]]. [[The Kentucky Center]], dedicated in 1983, located in the downtown hotel and entertainment district, is a premiere performing arts center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kentuckycenter.org/AboutUs/History |title=The Kentucky Center- History |accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features a variety of plays and concerts, and is the performance home of the [[Louisville Ballet]], [[Louisville Orchestra]], Broadway Across America - Louisville, Music Theatre Louisville, Stage One, KentuckyShow! and the [[Kentucky Opera]], which is the twelfth oldest [[opera]] in the [[United States]]. The center also manages the historic [[Brown Theatre|W. L. Lyons Brown Theatre]], which opened in 1925 and is patterned after New York's acclaimed [[Music Box Theatre]].

[[Actors Theatre of Louisville]] is another [[performing arts]] center that has become the cornerstone of the revitalization of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]'s Main Street. As the centerpiece of the city's urban cultural district, Actors Theatre has significant economic impact on a vital downtown life. Highly acclaimed for its artistic programming and business acumen, Actors Theatre hosts the [[Humana Festival of New American Plays]] each Spring. It also presents approximately six hundred performances of about thirty productions during its year-round season, composed of a diverse array of contemporary and classical fare. It has attracted one of the largest per capita subscription audiences in the country and logs an annual attendance of over 200,000.

[[The Louisville Palace]], one of the city's venues for the Louisville Orchestra, is an elegant, ornate theatre in [[downtown Louisville]]'s theatre district.  In addition to orchestra performances, the theatre also features an array of popular movies, old and new, as well as concerts by popular artists.  Located nearby is the [[Kentucky Theater]], which was built in 1921 and operated for 60 years as a movie house, but was closed and was almost demolished in 1986.  Ultimately it was saved by local arts advocates, and the newly renovated Kentucky Theater opened its doors in 2000 and has become a vibrant [[community art]]s center and [[art film]] house.

[[Iroquois Park]] is the home of the renovated [[Iroquois Amphitheater]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iroquoisamphitheater.com/|title=Iroquois Amphitheater|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which hosts a variety of musical concerts in a partially covered outdoor setting.  Up through 2008, it also hosted the musical productions of [[Music Theatre Louisville]], which moved to the Kentucky Center in 2009.

The Jewish Community Center of Louisville is home to Center Stage, whose members have performed some of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]'s best musicals. The shows range from new, hip, modern music all the way to [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] classics. In the 2008 Season, they are introducing straight plays to their stage again with the first part of ''[[Angels in America]]''.

Louisville is home to a thriving [[indie music scene]] with bands such as the widely known [[Love Jones (band)|Love Jones]], [[Flaw (band)|Flaw]], [[Slint]], [[My Morning Jacket]], [[Wax Fang]], [[VHS or Beta]] and [[The Villebillies]]. It is also home to the [[post-grunge]] band [[Days of the New]].

On Fourth Street in downtown is the brand new [[Fourth Street Live!]] outdoor entertainment complex, which features a wide variety of [[restaurant]]s, stores and [[nightclub]]s. The complex sponsors many free concerts, as does the popular [[Louisville Waterfront Park|Waterfront Park]].

The large performing arts community played a role in the relocation of [[ZFX Inc]],&lt;ref name="Business First"&gt;{{cite news | last = Adkins| first = Ben| title = Flying High. Louisville's ZFX gives performances a lift by creating special effects. | publisher = ''[[Business First]]'' | date = August 13, 2007 | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/2007/08/13/story3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second largest theatrical flying [[special effect]]s company in the world, from [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to Louisville in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6735">'''René-Yves Creston''' (25 October 1898 – 30 May 1964), born '''René Pierre Joseph Creston''', was a Breton artist, designer and ethnographer who founded the [[breton nationalism|Breton nationalist]] art movement [[Seiz Breur]]. During World War II he was active in the [[French Resistance]].

==Seiz Breur==
[[Image:Creston-debeauvais.jpg|thumb|250px|Cabinet designed by Creston as a wedding present for [[François Debeauvais]]]]
Born in [[Saint-Nazaire]], Creston studied art there and at [[Ancenis]],  followed by the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Nantes]] and Paris. In 1923, he was one of the founders with [[Jeanne Malivel]] and his wife Suzanne Creston, of [[Ar Seiz Breur]] (The Seven Brothers), which united dozens of Breton artists and designers in a movement to create a distinctive Breton avant-garde style. Creston participated in the decoration of the Pavilion of Brittany at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in Paris in 1925. Creston and Malivel also collaborated on furniture designs shown there. After the early death of Jeanne Malivel in 1926, he became the principal coordinator of Seiz Breur until the end of 1944.

In 1927, in collaboration with the young sculptor [[Jules-Charles Le Bozec]] (1898–1973), he designed the costumes for three plays: ''Ar C'hornandoned'', by Yann Bayon and [[Jean-Marie Perrot]], ''Tog Jani'' by Yves Le Moal and ''Lina'' by [[Roparz Hemon]], the first performance of which took place in January 1927. He also assisted in the publication of the art magazines ''Kornog'' and ''Keltia''. He worked in woodcut, watercolor, oil, and designed earthenware and sculpture. He also illustrated the book ''Kan da Gornog'' by [[Youenn Drezen]], for which he invented a new [[typeface]].

Creston was also associated with the wider Breton nationalist movement. He wrote articles for the Breton nationalist journal [[Breiz Atao]], and designed images for nationalist events. In 1929 he created a cabinet as a wedding present for the Breton nationalist leader [[François Debeauvais]]. However, after Debeauvais formed the separatist [[Breton National Party]] in 1931, Creston joined the rival moderate [[Breton Federalist League]].

==Ethnology==
In 1929 Creston became interested in ethnological research, which he pursued while maintaining his activities as an artist. He contributed as an ethnologist to the preservation of Breton heritage, most notably by his systematic cataloguing of Breton regional costumes, which was published posthumously in 1978 as ''Le Costume Breton''.  In 1931, he participated in the decoration of the hall of the Merchant Navy at the Colonial Exhibition in Paris. In 1933, he set out for a scientific cruise with [[Jean-Baptiste Charcot]] on his ship ''Pourquoi-Pas?''. His role was to visually document Arctic cultures. In 1936, he became an official Navy artist and joined the [[Musée de l'Homme]] in Paris, where he headed the department of the Arctic.

==Resistance activity==
After the [[fall of France]] in 1940, Creston helped to set up one of the first resistance networks, centred at the Musée de l'Homme. According to the American historian [[Martin Blumenson]], it had "a task of primary importance". Creston made three trips to Brittany to try to establish an effective communication network with England. He also recruited sympathizers. Most importantly, he organised a group to prepare and submit to him detailed plans of the port of St. Nazaire, especially the submarine base that the Germans had arranged for their own use, and particularly those aspects that were vulnerable to bombing. This material was passed to the British in preparation for the [[St. Nazaire Raid]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Blumenson, Le Réseau du Musée de l'Homme, Éditions Le Seuil, Paris, 1979 Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1941, Creston was arrested as a result of a denunciation and was imprisoned for four months in Paris. On his release, he was compelled to reside in [[Rennes]], under orders  to stay away from Paris. He played no further part in the resistance.

On 5 May 1946, he received the Certificate of Service signed by Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] for his work in the service of the allies.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Monnier, ''Résistance et conscience bretonne - L'hermine contre la croix gammée'', Éditions Yoran Embanner, Fouesnant, octobre 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with Seiz Breur===
{{see also|Breton nationalism and World War II}}
Creston's Resistance activity contrasted markedly with the collaborationism of other Breton nationalists, including colleagues in Seiz Breur. Fellow members [[Yann Goulet]] and [[Olier Mordrel]] were active supporters of Nazi Germany, in the belief that German victory would lead to Breton independence. Even before the fall of France Mordrel and François Debeauvais had set up a Breton government in exile in Germany in 1940. Nevertheless, during his period back in Brittany after 1941 Creston illustrated articles for their collaborationist publication ''[[L'Heure Bretonne]]'', signed with his pseudonym "Halgan". However, in 1944 with the liberation of France, Creston resigned as director of Seiz Breur. He was replaced by [[Raffig Tullou]].

==After the war==
After World War II, Creston succeeded Yann Sohier as president of [[Ar Falz]], an organization devoted to the promotion of the Breton language and of progressive and secular values in Brittany.

In 1949, he joined the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]], conducted his research on Breton peasant costumes, and was sent on a mission to Naples and Sicily. At the end of career, he was responsible for reorganizing the ethnology museums in Rennes ([[Museum of Brittany]]) and [[Quimper, Finistère|Quimper]] (Museum Breton). He ended his career as Director of the Museum of [[Saint-Brieuc]].

'''Requiem for Mobile Telephones'''&lt;ref&gt;Published in Neunzert 2008, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; is an interactive [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]]&lt;ref&gt;Putová 2013, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[performance art|performance artist]] [[Lubo Kristek]] and also a series of his [[happening]]s. The artist started his happening series in 2007 to protest against the addictions to new technologies. He asked the audience to give up their mobile phones and use them to create an assemblage.&lt;ref name="p121"&gt;Putová 2013, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Background ==
The first action was held in the city of [[Znojmo]]. The spectators sewed the mobile phones directly on to the artist wearing a jacket with a train (the jacket then became the basis for new assemblage). 

The second happening took place in public area – on the pavement of Mariahilfer Straße in [[Vienna]] in 2007. Kristek who likes to remove the barriers between art and reality, deliberately got with his action in the way of passers-by to pull them out of their stereotype and to force them adopt an attitude. The artist dipped the balerina’s [[pointe shoe]]s into the paint and let her dance on a blank canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Putová 2013, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The pointe shoes also became part of the assemblage afterwards. Then he invited school pupils and passers-by to help to create the new assemblage, to paint and sew more mobile phones on to it. Art and life merged in the [[avant-garde]] sense.

The assemblage travelled to an exhibition at the Barockschloß Riegersburg, today [[Schloss Ruegers]] (2007). The artist continued to travel with his mission to other states. With each happening interaction the assemblage changed its shape.

In 2008, the happening series continued in the Neues Stadtmuseum, [[Landsberg am Lech]]. It was part of the retrospective exhibition of the works by Lubo Kristek titled ''Third Eye of Distant Communication''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Manuela|last=Rieger|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/landsberg/Kunst-zum-Nachdenken-id3697011.html|title=Kunst zum Nachdenken|website=Augsburger Algemeine|publisher=|date=12 May 2008|access-date=16 August 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|In the happening a new character appeared, Temptation (played by the prima ballerina of the Brno National Theatre Jana Přibylová), who gives the spectators electronic devices from a pink sack and who suddenly turnes into the devil). In one of the last scenes, this character toys with a representation of human fate – a black figurine – which she throws to the ground as soon as she tires of her plaything. At the end of the happening, Kristek carried the pink sack full of electronic refuse to the altar of the Landsberg Church of the Holy Cross. In this way, he emphasised the sharp contrast between our ancestors´ legacy and what will remain after the current epoch.&lt;ref name="requiem"&gt;Putová 2018, [http://glyptotheque.com/index.php/meeting-point/requiem-for-mobile-telephones Chapter: Meeting place – Requiem for Mobile Telephones]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following happening took place in a Polish city of [[Sucha Beskidzka]]  in 2010. According to Kristek, the relationship of contemporary society to the mobile telephone bears the traits of a [[cult]] or even a pathological dependency. Therefore he places this “modern god” on the altar (with the inscription Rest in Peace) and lets a giant triple-breasted angel to drill it through. The participants of the happening actively contribute to the act of [[sacrifice|sacrificing]] the mobile phones.

{{Quote|The artist destroys the mobiles in the happenings. He disposes of them like refuse, but at the same time, he applies the ritual principle of sacrifice. The participants of the happening then “receive” the destroyed telephone (analogous with the torn up god) or even “consume” it via their reconnection in the creative process (analogous with the resurrection). The characters and spectators sew the mobiles on to the travelling assemblage, and they become co-creators of a work of art with a shape that changes from event to event. So through his message ''Requiem for Mobile Telephones'', Kristek achieves what he foretold in his picture ''The Moss Covered Telephone Call''. He experiments with the involvement of the public in events at he{Clarification}} interface between ritual and theatrical and creative art, with the use of random impulses during a collective creative process and with emphasis on the experiencing of the current moment. He attempts to restore lost communication and transform relations in an alienated “digital society”.&lt;ref name="requiem" /&gt;}}

''Requiem for Mobile Telephones'' belongs to Kristek’s critical assemblages as well as ''Soundproof Aesthetic of Luxuriety'' (1976) that reveals the traps of consume approach and ''In the Prematurely Cloned Age of One Planet'' (2003) that questiones the ethics of current medical science.

'''Robert Watts''' was an American artist best known for his work as a member of the international group of artists [[Fluxus]]. Born in [[Burlington, Iowa]] June 14, 1923,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/bio.html] Robert Watts on Fluxus Artpool&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.ca/cybermuse/search/artist_e.jsp?iartistid=5816 Cybermuse]&lt;/ref&gt; he became Professor of Art at Douglass College, [[Rutgers University]], New Jersey in 1953, a post he kept until 1984. In the 1950s, he was in close contact with other teachers at Rutgers including [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Geoffrey Hendricks]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. This has led some critics to claim that [[pop art]] and [[conceptual art]] began at Rutgers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mgsa.rutgers.edu/runy/runy03_nfc.html Sid Sachs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/acatalog/__Off_Limits_257.html Corinne Robins]&lt;/ref&gt;

He organised the proto-fluxus ''Yam Festival'', May 1963 with [[George Brecht]], and was one of the main protagonists, along with [[George Maciunas]], in turning [[SoHo]], New York, into an artist's quarter. He died Friday September 2, 1988 of lung cancer in [[Martins Creek, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/04/obituaries/robert-watts-artist-and-fluxus-figure-dies-of-cancer-at-65.html New York Times Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also known as '''Bob Watts''' or '''Doctor Bob'''.

==Early life==
[[Image:WattsBlackEggs.jpg|200px|left|thumb|''Black Eggs'', 1964, a piece included at the ''American Supermarket'' exhibition at New York's Bianchini Gallery. This piece is now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington]]
After earning a degree in [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Louisville]], Watts served as an officer in the United States Navy aboard aircraft carriers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/Friedman_e.html Flux Med Dr Bob]&lt;/ref&gt; Watts left the Navy and moved to New York in 1948, where he studied art at the [[Art Students League]] and later at [[Columbia University]] from where he gained a degree in the History of Art, majoring in pre-Columbian and non-Western Art.&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;  After becoming Professor of Art at Douglass College, Rutgers University, 1953, he started to exhibit works in a proto-pop style. He participated in Pop Art shows such as ''New Forms, New Media'' exhibition in 1960 at Martha Jackson's Gallery; the ''Popular Image'' exhibition at the Washington Gallery of Art in 1963; and the 1964 ''American Supermarket'' exhibition at New York's Bianchini Gallery, which also featured [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Tom Wesselmann]].&lt;ref name="MailArt"&gt;[http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html Mail Art John Held Jr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405050332/http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html |date=April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After exhibiting at [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli's]] Gallery in 1964, Watts turned his back on the gallery system, and concentrated instead on the [[anti-art]] of the emerging New York avant-garde centred around George Maciunas. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[His] work obviously related to that of the Pop artists that I had discovered a few years before...Watts' chromed objects closely related to [[Jasper Johns|Johns']] cast beer cans and flashlights, for instance. The 1964 exhibition also included Watts' sculpture of plaster cast loaves of bread on shelves. That work, in particular, I think of as one of his most important inventions. I'm also particularly fond of the chrome eggs and egg carton in my own collection which will appear in this [posthumous] show. The public will be surprised that an artist -so promising at such an early date- did not receive through the years the appreciation he deserved." Leo Castelli&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Yam Festival===
[[Image:LanternEvent.jpg|240px|right|thumb|''Lantern Event; an aspect of Yam Festival'', 1962, a mail art piece by Robert Watts and George Brecht; the coloured paper scores are by Watts.]]
Watts met the artist and chemist [[George Brecht]] in 1957 after the latter saw an exhibition of Watts' work and sought his acquaintance;&lt;ref&gt;George Brecht; A Heterospective, Konig, 2005, p306&lt;/ref&gt; the two would meet for lunch every week, with Kaprow occasionally joining them, for a number of years to discuss art and to plan joint exhibitions. One of the most famous was the proto-fluxus ''Yam Festival'' (1962–3), which used mail-art to build expectations for a month-long series of happenings, performances and exhibitions at Rutgers, New York City and [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal's]] farm in [[New Jersey]]. Participating artists included [[Alison Knowles]], [[Ay-O]], [[Al Hansen]], [[Ray Johnson]], [[John Cage]], and [[Dick Higgins]]. The events ran parallel to George Maciunas' Fluxus Festivals in Europe (Sept 1962-early 1963) -which had already performed some of Watts' event scores in Düsseldorf- and the two events were officially joined when Maciunas published Brecht's event scores as [[Water Yam (artist's multiple)|''Water Yam'']], the first of the Flux boxes to be published. Watts' own flux collection, ''Robert Watts Events'' was published a year later and brought together many of the mail art event scores that had been used to publicise the Yam Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/Miller_h.html Flux Med]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I consider Yam Lecture a chain of events arranged in such a way that the sequence is quite random, no performance exactly like any other, with changing performers, costumers, actions, sounds, words, images, and so on. The 'structure' is such that it is very flexible (nearly non-existent) and permits inclusion of anything one wished to do and any possible future changes. It is a loose and open thing. The audience puts it together the way it wishes or not at all."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Similar ideas were at work in Yam Festival which George Brecht and I carried out last year. In effect this was a mailing to an audience, sometimes randomly chosen, of an assortment of things. Some were event cards similar to the above; others were objects, food, pencils, soap, photos, actions, words, facts, statements, declarations, puzzles, etc. Certain ones were by subscription. One might say this way of working is a way or manner of calling attention to what one wishes to talk about; or it is a way of talking about it. Or it is a way to hold up for scrutiny a range of material that ordinarily is not so directly useful for art or has not yet been so considered." Robert Watts, quoted in the Times Literary Supplement, 1964&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One example of Watts' event scores around this point is ''Casual Event'';

===''Casual Event'' (1962)===
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;drive car to filling station&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;inflate right front tire&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;continue to inflate until tire blows out&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;change tire*&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;drive home

&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;*if car is newer model drive home on blown out tire

According to [[Henry Flynt]], Maciunas '[begged] Watts not to continue 'Yam' separately from Fluxus. Maciunas was desperate to unite the whole post-Cage movement under his command.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html Mailart; Robert Watts by John Held Jr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405050332/http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html |date=April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluxus===
[[Image:Wattstimekit.jpg|200px|left|thumb|A number of versions of the ''Flux Timekit'', 1967, by Robert Watts, collecting together objects that exist in different time scales.]]
Watts' friendship with Maciunas was cemented when the latter was confined to a hospital bed throughout May 1963. To cheer him up, Watts sent him ''Hospital Events'' (see [http://printedmatter.org/catalogue/moreinfo.cfm?title_id=3931&amp;return=/search/search.cfm&amp;qty=0&amp;type=1&amp;email=&amp;cookie1=D9E71EB4-1C42-ECEB-7880DA46C41B8750&amp;retail=100.0000&amp;qty=1&amp;page=3&amp;frompage=Search%20%3E%20%3CA%20HREF%3D%2Fcatalogue%2Fsearch%2Ecfm%3Femail%3D%26cookie1%3DD9E71EB4%2D1C42%2DECEB%2D7880DA46C41B8750%26search%3Dfluxus%2520box%26search%5Ftype%3D%3Efluxus%20box%3C%2FA%3E]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/Hendricks_e.html Geoff Hendricks] retrieved 23–04–09&lt;/ref&gt; Maciunas enjoyed the piece so much that he published it as an early ''Fluxbox''; many of Watts' contemporary event cards were subsequently included in ''Fluxus 1'', 1963, Maciunas' first year box compiling works by the members of the international avant-garde.&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It must have been Alison Knowles who called me up to say [George Maciunas] was in bad shape with asthma in an Air Force hospital in Germany and needed help or at least some encouragement.... I decided to send something for entertainment, so I stuck some pistol caps on the back of old photos from an Italian magazine of WWI vintage. I remember there was a photo of a priest blessing a propeller of an Italian Air Force fighter plane. The idea was to put the photo on an anvil and hit the front with a hammer until all the caps exploded. Later GM said he got a big kick out of this procedure, especially since after he exploded all the caps, he set up the photos' remains for the locals to continue the destruction.... he said the people beat the shit out of those photos until there was nothing left but fuzz." Robert Watts, 1980&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p62&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Over the years Watts contributed a number of works to Fluxus including a ''Flux Atlas'', a collection of rocks from different countries, and a ''Flux Timekit'', a series of boxes that housed objects that existed in different time scales, such as seeds to be planted, a time-lapsed photo of a speeding bullet and a pocket watch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/mesch.shtml Cold War Games and Postwar Art / Claudia Mesch] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713171331/http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/mesch.shtml |date=July 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also set up ''Implosions Inc.'' with Maciunas to mass-produce novelty items, and helped run the ''Flux Housing Co-Operative'', an artist-run scheme that is held responsible for the rehabilitation and gentrification of SoHo, offering cheap loft spaces to artists throughout the sixties and seventies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0532909/bio Imdb Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Watts himself was the first resident of the first working Flux Co-Op at 80 Wooster Street.&lt;ref&gt;Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p170&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonas Mekas]]' cinematheque and Maciunas' apartment were housed in the same building which soon became the 'central Fluxus loft'.&lt;ref&gt;Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p177&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in the notorious ''Flux Mass'', and was one of the very few original artists apart from Maciunas himself to have neither distanced himself from the movement, nor to have been expelled.

==Posthumous Reputation==
Referred to as ''the invisible man of Fluxus and Pop'' by the critic Kim Levin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_3_88/ai_60130219/ Watts and Kaprow, Sid Sachs]&lt;/ref&gt; a term later used as the title of a solo posthumous show in Kassel,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/artistInfo/artist/1994/lang/1 ArtFactsNet&lt;/ref&gt; Watts remains a 'distant, aloof, and enigmatic'&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt; figure. In general his reputation has gradually recovered since the late 90s, although not without comments on some of the works' perceived sexism.&lt;ref name="Richard"/&gt; As individual members of Fluxus have increasingly been singled out for re-appraisals, Watts work has been seen in a number of solo and small group shows across the USA and Europe.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'There is something impersonal or phlegmatic in Watts's composition, a deliberately flattened sense of timing. This aspect of his work has not aged as gracefully as have his concerns with commodity and its absurdities. A puckish wit remains where media and message are crisply meshed, as in Portrait Dress, 1965, a see-through vinyl frock with pockets for photographs, or the suite of neon signs in which the signatures of masters like Ingres, Duchamp, and Lichtenstein glow like ads. Other items in this show appeared dated, such as the Lucite sculptures with embedded photographs of food, or the painted plaster casts of bread lined up in a grayscale row, but this was largely because their semiotic jokesterism has been so wholly assimilated by successors that it cannot startle now as it did then.' Frances Richard, 2001&lt;ref name="Richard"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_2_40/ai_79826078]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
His work is held in numerous collections, including The [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=86231 Cloud Music]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Art Institute of Chicago]], The [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], [[Walker Art Center]], Minneapolis, [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris,  [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], [[Kunsthaus Zurich]], and [[Tate Modern]], London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/bio.html Doctor Bob, Flux Med]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tall tale''' is a story with unbelievable elements, related as if it were true and factual. Some stories such as these are [[exaggeration]]s of actual events, for example [[wikt:fish story|fish stories]] ("the fish that got away") such as, "That fish was so big, why I tell ya', it nearly sank the boat when I pulled it in!" Other tall tales are completely fictional tales set in a familiar setting, such as the [[Europe]]an [[countryside]], the [[American frontier]], the Canadian Northwest, or the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Things are often told in a way that makes the narrator seem to have been a part of the story, and are good-natured. The line between legends and tall tales is distinguished primarily by age; many legends exaggerate the exploits of their heroes, but in tall tales the exaggeration looms large, to the extent of becoming the whole of the story.

=={{anchor|American tall taIe}}American tall tale==
The tall tale is a fundamental element of [[Folklore of the United States|American folk literature]]. The tall tale's origins are seen in the bragging contests that often occurred when the rough men of the [[American frontier]] gathered. The tales of legendary figures of the Old West, some listed below, owe much to the style of tall tales.

The semi-annual speech contests held by [[Toastmasters International]] public speaking clubs may include a Tall Tales contest. Each and every participating speaker is given three to five minutes to give a short speech of a tall tale nature, and is then judged according to several factors. The winner proceeds to the next level of competition. The contest does not proceed beyond any participating district in the organization to the International level.

The [[comic strip]] ''[[Non Sequitur (comic strip)|Non Sequitur]]'' sometimes features tall tales told by the character Captain Eddie; it is left up to the reader to decide if he is telling the truth, exaggerating a real event, or just telling a [[wikt:whopper|whopper]].

===Examples===

*[[Alfred Bulltop Stormalong]] &amp;ndash; An immense sailor whose ship was so big it scraped [[the moon]]

==Similar traditions in other cultures==
[[File:Skvader.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[skvader]], an example of a tall tale hunting story.]]
Similar [[storytelling]] traditions are present elsewhere. For instance:

===Australian tall tales===
The Australian frontier (known as the bush or the outback) similarly inspired the types of tall tales that are found in American folklore. The Australian versions typically concern a mythical [[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]] called [[The Speewah]]. The heroes of the Speewah include:
*[[Rodney Ansell]] 
*Big Bill &amp;ndash; The dumbest man on the Speewah who made his living cutting up [[mining]] shafts and selling them for post holes
*[[Crooked Mick]] &amp;ndash; A champion [[Sheep shearer|shearer]] who had colossal strength and quick wit.

Another folk hero in Australian folklore is [[Charlie McKeahnie]], the hero of [[Banjo Paterson]]'s poem "[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man from Snowy River]]", whose bravery, adaptability, and risk-taking could epitomise the new Australian spirit.

===Canadian tall tales===
The Canadian frontier has also inspired the types of tall tales that are found in American folklore, such as: 
*[[French Canadian]] tales of [[Big Joe Mufferaw]], a giant of a lumberjack and woodsman from the [[Ottawa Valley]], loosely based on real-life lumberjack  [[Joseph Montferrand]]
*Johnny Chinook, a Canadian cowboy and rancher [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] of the Canadian West's [[Alberta]]
*Ti-Jean, a giant 10-year-old French-Canadian lumberjack boy{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
*Sam McGee, the hero of Robert Service's poem "[[The Cremation of Sam McGee]]" (1907)

===European tall tales===
[[File:Giants causeway closeup.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The [[Columnar basalt]] that makes up the Giant's Causeway; in legend, a fine set of [[hexagonal]] stepping stones to Scotland, made by Fionn mac Cumhaill]] 
Some European tall tales include:
*[[Toell the Great]] was one of the great tall tales of Estonia.
*The [[Babin Republic]], in Renaissance Poland (1568) was a satirical society dedicated entirely to mocking people and telling tall tales
*Juho Nätti (1890–1964), known as Nätti-Jussi, was a Finnish lumberjack known for telling tall tales; his stories have also circulated as folk tales and been collected in books.
*''[[The Life of Gargantua and of Pantagruel]]'' (16th Century) by the French writer [[Rabelais]] told the tale of two giants; father and son.
*The many farfetched adventures of the fictional German nobleman [[Baron Munchausen]], some of which may have had a [[folklore]] basis.
*Legends of the Irish mythological hunter-warrior [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]], also known as Finn MacCool, have it that he built the [[Giant's Causeway]] as stepping-stones to Scotland, so as not to get his feet wet, and that he also once scooped up part of Ireland to fling it at a rival, but it missed and landed in the [[Irish Sea]]; the clump became the [[Isle of Man]], the pebble became [[Rockall]], and the void became [[Lough Neagh]].
*A [[brown bear]] coating himself in baking soda to be acceptable to humans as a [[polar bear]], a young boy selling frozen words, and a woman whose voice cuts through a giant tree to release oranges that light the Polar night are all tales told by a [[Pomor]] elder in the Soviet animation film ''[[Laughter and Grief by the White Sea]]'' (1988). 
*The Cumbrian Liars, a United Kingdom association who follow in the [[Seven-league boots|seven-league footsteps]] of Will Ritson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grizedale.org/lying/history/index.htm |title=Cumbrian Liars|website=grizedale.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern-day tall tales==
[[Arlo Guthrie]]'s ''[[Alice's Restaurant (album)|Motorcycle Song]]'' is often accompanied by a tall tale about the origin of the song.

__NOTOC__
'''''The Golden Stairs''''' is one of the best-known paintings by the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]].  It was begun in 1876 and exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in 1880.&lt;ref name="Wildman"&gt;Wildman and Christian (1998), pp. 246–249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Wood (1997), pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many of Burne-Jones's works, ''The Golden Stairs'' is not based on a literary source. It has been called [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]],&lt;ref&gt;Wood (1997), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; as it has no recognisable narrative, but rather sets a mood.  It is a harmony of color in the tradition of the [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic]] works of the 1860s and 1870s, as a group of young women carrying musical instruments descend a spiraling staircase, dressed in classically inspired robes in tones of white, shading to gold and silver.&lt;ref name="smarth"&gt;{{cite web | title =The Golden Stairs| work = | publisher =Smarthistory at Khan Academy | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/burne-jones-the-golden-stairs.html | accessdate =31 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wildman247"&gt;Wildman and Christian (1998), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[F. G. Stephens]] wrote in ''[[The Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' that the musicians "troop past like spirits in an enchanted dream ... whither they go, who they are, there is nothing to tell".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wood (1997), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Golden Stairs'' was one of many paintings Burne-Jones sketched out in 1872 following a trip to Italy.  He began work on the canvas in 1876 and finished it in great haste in April 1880, just days before the Grosvenor Gallery exhibition was to open.  Stephens found in the painting echoes of the work of [[Piero della Francesca]], whose frescoes Burne-Jones had seen and copied in 1871.&lt;ref name="Wildman247" /&gt; The figures of the musicians were drawn from professional models, but the heads are young women of Burne-Jones's circle.&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt; Some identifications have been made as follows.

His daughter Margaret is fourth from top, holding a trumpet.&lt;ref name=MacCarthy102&gt;MacCarthy (2011), p. 102 (caption to colour plate VI)&lt;/ref&gt; Edith Gellibrand, known by the stage name Edith Chester, is seventh from top, seen stooping.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus (1975), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; [[May Morris]], daughter of [[William Morris]], is ninth from top, holding a violin. Frances Graham, later known as Lady Horner, daughter of [[William Graham (Glasgow MP)|William Graham]], is bottom left, holding cymbals.&lt;ref name=MacCarthy102/&gt; Standing behind her on the stairs is [[Mary Gladstone]], daughter of [[William Gladstone]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCarthy (2011), p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; Others include Laura Tennant, later known as [[Laura Lyttelton]], and Mary Stuart-Wortley, later [[Ralph King-Milbanke, 2nd Earl of Lovelace|Lady Lovelace]].&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;

The painting was purchased by [[Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea|Cyril Flower]] (1843–1907), later Lord Battersea, a politician and art patron, and was bequeathed by him to the [[Tate Britain|Tate Gallery]], where it remains.&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6200">[[File:Paul Signac, 1905, The Lagoon of Saint Mark, Venice, oil on canvas, 129.5 x 162.6 cm, Chrysler Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|290px|[[Paul Signac]], 1905, ''The Lagoon of Saint Mark, Venice'', oil on canvas, 129.5 x 162.6 cm, [[Chrysler Museum of Art]], Norfolk VA]]
'''''The Lagoon of Saint Mark, Venice''''' is an oil on canvas painting by [[Paul Signac]]. This painting focuses on a seascape image which became a common theme late in Signac's life.

Paul Signac (1863–1935) was one of the most influential Neo-Impressionist painters of his time. His name is synonymous with that of [[Georges Seurat]] (1859–91) as well as the practice of Color Theory. One of his lesser-known paintings, ''The Lagoon of Saint Mark, Venice,'' (1905) is a prime example of his technique of pointillism and experimentation with color theory.

==Description==
The painting depicts an afternoon on a lagoon in Venice, and is a testament to Signac's skill with seascape imagery. The work is constructed with brilliant hues of blues and greens juxtaposing one another. When standing close to the painting, the only discernible features are the brush strokes; this technique of painting was labeled, [[Pointillism]], by Seurat. Artists using this technique along with Seurat became known as [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionists]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, Eyewitness Art, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Lagoon'' of Saint Mark, Venice, is in the background, gondolas in the middle ground, and docks can be seen in the foreground. The sky is awash with pastel purple and blue and large clouds appear throughout the top half of the canvas. The bottom half of the canvas depicts a series of steps leading down to the docks where gondolas are haphazardly tied to posts in the water. The water slowly ebbs in from the wake of the slow-moving gondola in the middle of the painting. The mirroring effect that the steps and water have on one another makes the painting come alive as this movement extends out of the canvas towards the viewer.

==Signac and Seurat==
Signac came into contact with this technique through Seurat as the two became good friends. Signac met Seurat in 1884 at a meeting of the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants]].&lt;ref&gt;Ratliff, Paul Signac and Color, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two exhibited their work together at the first Salon des Indépendants.&lt;ref&gt;Ratliff, Paul Signac and Color, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Seurat was Signac's primary source of influence and the two were able to come up with a similar the process of color division on a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Shackelford, The Romance of Modernism, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eugene Chevreul]] was a scientist who put forth the theory that colors appear most intensely when placed next to their complements, coining this theory the "law of simultaneous contrast".&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, Eyewitness Art, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Signac and Seurat took this theory and created paintings that explored the scientific reasoning behind color.

Signac stayed true to this technique throughout his career from his meeting Seurat until his death in 1935. He published treatises on the topic of color such as ''D'Eugène Delacroix au Neo-Impressionnisme'', in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Ratliff, Paul Signac and Color, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Signac was active in the Neo-Impressionist world becoming president of the Société des Artistes Indépendants in 1908 and remaining in office until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Ratliff, Paul Signac and Color, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; His more famous paintings depict seascapes such as ''Antibes, The Pink Cloud'' (1916). ''The Lagoon of St. Mark'' is an early example of his seascapes that clearly demonstrates the process of color division and the law of simultaneous contrast.

Hanging in the Impressionist gallery, in the [[Chrysler Museum of Art]], Signac's 1905 painting is surrounded by the likes of [[Claude Monet]], [[Edgar Degas]], and [[Pierre Renoir]]. The room is awash with color and movement and amidst it all, ''The Lagoon'' is displayed predominantly on the back wall. Next to it hangs [[Henri-Edmond Cross]]'s ''Excursion'' complementing Signac's painting. The two works utilize the pointillist technique although they sport notable differences. Cross was a contemporary of Signac's and the two met at the founding of the Société des Artistes Indépendants in 1884; Cross however didn't practice the theory of [[Divisionism]] until 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Museum Collection, "The Lagoon of Saint Mark, Venice."&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing Signac's painting with Cross's, both clearly utilize the pointillist technique to the fullest, however ''The Lagoon'' is much less delineated in terms of appearance. With ''The Lagoon,'' viewers are required to step away from the painting in order to take in the whole image; whereas with ''Excursion,'' the entirety of the image can be seen closer to the canvas.

Signac's life was devoted to finding harmony with colour, writing, "It is through the harmonies of lines and of colors...not through the subject that the painter ought to stir the emotions." &lt;ref&gt;Ratliff, Paul Signac and Color, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving a perfect balance with colour in this painting is one testament to Signac's skill as a Neo-Impressionist artist.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

'''''The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist''''', sometimes called '''''The Burlington House Cartoon''''', is a drawing by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The drawing is in [[charcoal]] and black and white [[chalk]], on eight sheets of paper glued together.  Because of its large size and format the drawing is presumed to be a [[cartoon]] for a painting. No painting by Leonardo exists that is based directly on this cartoon.

The drawing depicts the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] seated on the knees of her mother, [[Saint Anne|St Anne]], while holding the [[Child Jesus]] as Jesus' young cousin, [[John the Baptist|St. John the Baptist]], stands to the right. It currently hangs in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in [[London]].

It was either executed in around 1499–1500, at the end of the artist's first Milanese period, or around 1506–1508, when he was shuttling between Florence and Milan. The majority of scholars prefer the latter date, although the National Gallery and others prefer the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fra Angelico to Leonardo: Italian Renaissance Drawings |last1= Chapman |first1= Hugo |last2= Faietti |first2= Marzia |year= 2010 |publisher= British Museum Press |location= London |isbn=978-0-7141-2667-8 |page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject==
[[File:Leonardo da vinci, Study for the Burlington House Cartoon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Preparatory drawing in the [[British Museum]], London, UK.]]

The subject of the cartoon is a combination of two themes popular in [[Italian Renaissance painting#The Madonna|Florentine painting]] of the 15th century: ''The Virgin and Child with John the Baptist'' and ''[[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne|The Virgin and Child with St Anne]]''.

The drawing is notable for its complex composition, demonstrating the alternation in the positioning of figures that is first apparent in Leonardo's paintings in the ''[[Benois Madonna]]''. The knees of the two women point different directions, with Mary's knees turning out of the painting to the left, while her body turns sharply to the right, creating a sinuous movement. The knees and the feet of the figures establish a strong up-and-down rhythm at a point in the composition where a firm foundation comprising firmly planted feet, widely spread knees and broad spread of enclosing garment would normally be found. While the lower halves of their bodies turn away, the faces of the two women turn towards each other, mirroring each other's features. The delineation between the upper bodies has lost clarity, suggesting that the heads are part of the same body.

The twisting movement of the Virgin is echoed in the Christ Child, whose body, held almost horizontal by his mother, rotates axially, with the lower body turned upward and the upper body turned downward. This turning posture is first indicated in Leonardo's painting in the ''Adoration of the Magi'' and is explored in a number of drawings, in particular the various studies of the Virgin and Child with a cat that are in the [[British Museum]].

The juxtaposition of two sets of heads is an important compositional element. The angle, lighting and gaze of the Christ Child reproduces that of his mother, while John the Baptist reproduces these same elements in the face of St Anne. The lighting indicates that there are two protagonists, and two supporting cast in the scene that the viewer is witnessing. There is a subtle interplay between the gazes of the four figures. St Anne smiles adoringly at her daughter Mary, perhaps indicating not only maternal pride but also the veneration due to the one who "all generations will call...blessed".&lt;ref&gt;from the [[Magnificat]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's eyes are fixed on the Christ Child who raises his hand in a gesture of [[benediction]] over the cousin who thirty years later would carry out his appointed task of [[Baptism|baptising]] Jesus.  Although the older of the two children, John the Baptist humbly accepts the blessing, as one who would later say of his cousin "I am not worthy even to unloose his sandals." &lt;ref&gt;John's Gospel, Chapter 1, verse 27.&lt;/ref&gt; St Anne's hand, her index finger pointing towards the [[Heaven]], is positioned near the heads of the children, perhaps to indicate the original source of the blessing. This enigmatic gesture is regarded as quintessentially Leonardesque, occurring in ''[[Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' and ''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|St John the Baptist]]''.

[[File:B Luini Sacra Famiglia con S Giovannino S Anna Milano Ambrosiana.jpg|thumb|''Holy Family with St Anne and the infant John the Baptist'', [[Bernardino Luini]]]]
Cartoons of this sort were usually transferred to a board for painting by pricking or incising the outline. In the ''Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist'' this has not been done, suggesting that the drawing has been kept as a work of art in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery Website [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/server.php?show=conObject.756 Leonardo's cartoon of the ''Virgin and Child with St Anne and John the Baptist''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823083105/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/server.php?show=conObject.756 |date=2010-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo does not appear to have based a painting directly on this drawing. The composition differs from Leonardo's only other surviving treatment of the subject, ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne]]'' in the [[Louvre]], in which the figure of the Baptist is not present. A painting based on the cartoon was made by a pupil of Leonardo, [[Bernardino Luini]], and is now in the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]], [[Milan]].&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt; The figure of [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]] in [[Francesco Melzi]]'s painting ''Pomona and Vertumnus'' in [[Berlin]] is based upon the Virgin in the cartoon.

==History==
The date and place of execution of the cartoon is disputed. The earliest reference to it is by the biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] who, writing in the mid 16th century, says that the work was created while Leonardo was in [[Florence]], as a guest of the Servite Monastery. Vasari says that for two days people young and old flocked to see the drawing as if they were attending a festival.&lt;ref name=Vasari&gt;[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''Lives of the Artists'', Penguin Classics, translated: George Bull, (1965) pp. 255–271, {{ISBN|0-14-044164-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would date the cartoon to about 1500.

A date of 1498–99 is put on the work by Padre Sebastiano Resta who wrote to [[Giovanni Pietro Bellori]] saying that Leonardo had drawn the cartoon in [[Milan]] at the request of [[Louis XII]] of France. While this date has gained wide acceptance, the association with Louis XII has not. More recent historians have dated the work as early as the mid 1490s and, in the case of Carlo Pedretti and [[Kenneth Clark]], as late as 1508–10.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Wasserman, "The Dating and Patronage of Leonardo's Burlington House Cartoon", ''The Art Bulletin'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Martin Kemp]] notes that the hydraulic engineering in the preparatory drawing in the British Museum dates the composition to around 1507–8, when Leonardo was making similar studies in the [[Codex Atlanticus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/The+National+Gallery%E2%80%99s+blockbuster+exhibition+could+mark+a+turning+point+for+Leonardo+scholars/25515 |title= The National Gallery's blockbuster exhibition could mark a turning point for Leonardo scholars |last1= Kemp |first1= Martin |authorlink= Martin Kemp (art historian) |date= 1 February 2012 |work= [[The Art Newspaper]] |accessdate= 1 February 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120208191229/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/The+National+Gallery%E2%80%99s+blockbuster+exhibition+could+mark+a+turning+point+for+Leonardo+scholars/25515 |archivedate= 8 February 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century the drawing belonged to the Counts Arconati of Milan. In 1721 it passed to the Casnedis, then to the Sagredo in Venice. In 1763 it was acquired by Robert Udny, brother of the English ambassador to Venice. By 1791 it was inventoried as belonging to the [[Royal Academy]], London.&lt;ref name=Chiesa&gt;Angela Ottino della Chiesa, ''The Complete Paintings of Leonardo da Vinci'', Penguin, (1967), {{ISBN|0-14-008649-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes still known as "The [[Burlington House]] Cartoon", in reference to the building housing the Royal Academy.

In 1962 the cartoon was put on sale for £800,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jonathan | last=Conlin | year=2006 | title=The Nation's Mantelpiece: A history of the National Gallery}}, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Amid fears that it would find an overseas buyer, it was exhibited in the National Gallery where it was seen by over a quarter of a million people in a little over four months, many of whom made donations in order to keep it in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toynbee | first=Polly | author-link=Polly Toynbee |editor-first=Richard | editor-last=Verdi |title=Saved! 100 years of the National Art Collections Fund |publisher=Scala |year=2003 |pages=298–301 |chapter=The Free Admission Campaign |isbn=1-85759-304-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price was eventually met, thanks in part to contributions from the [[National Art Collections Fund]]. Ten years after its acquisition, [[John Berger]] wrote derisively that "It has acquired a new kind of impressiveness. Not because of what it shows – not because of the meaning of its image. It has become impressive, mysterious because of its market value".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Berger]], ''Ways of Seeing'', Penguin (1972) {{ISBN|0-14-013515-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the cartoon was attacked in an act of vandalism with a sawn-off shotgun from a distance of approximately seven feet. The shooter was identified as a mentally ill man by the name of Robert Cambridge who claimed he committed this act in order to bring attention to "political, social and economic conditions in Britain." The blast shattered the glass covering, causing significant damage to the artwork which has since been restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/arts/restoring-a-leonardo-drawing-that-was-hit-by-a-shotgun-blast.html |title=Restoring a Leonardo Drawing That Was Hit by a Shotgun Blast |last1= Rule |first1= Shelia |date= November 8, 1988 |work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= 1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3140">'''Thomas Kershaw''' (1819&amp;ndash;1898) was a leading British pioneer of [[marbleizing]], the creation of imitation marble finishes.

He was born in Standish, Lancashire and from the age of 12 served his time as an apprentice to John Platt, a Bolton painter and decorator. During this time he bought graining tools with money earned from painting pictures and developed his skills in the art of wood graining. On completion of his apprenticeship he moved firstly to Manchester, then York and finally in 1845 to London. There he was employed by [[William Cubitt and Company]], becoming their leading wood grainer.

In the mid-1840s he left Cubitts to be independent and exhibited his imitation marble panels at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851, which won him a prize. At the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle of 1855]] he won a gold medal, but felt obliged to carry out public demonstrations of his craft in the exhibition hall after accusations that he was using some type of fraudulent transfer technique. On his return he bought a house in Baker Street and set up his own specialist decorating company.

He was given several lucrative contracts, including one from the Royal family to marbleise the columns at [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[Osborne House]], but turned down a request from the Russian Ambassador to marbleise the interior of the Imperial Palace in St Petersburg. In 1862 he won another gold medal at the London Exhibition and was elected a liveryman in the Painter-Stainers Company for thirty-eight years. In 1860 he was granted the [[Freedom of the City]] of London.

He died a rich man in 1898. He had married in 1857 and had a daughter.

'''Turtleback''' or '''Turtle-back tombs''' or '''turtle shell tombs''' ({{zh|s=龟壳墓|t=龜殼墓|p=guī ké mù|poj=ku-khak-bōng}}; {{lang-ja|亀甲墓}}, ''kamekōbaka'') are a particular type of [[tomb]]s commonly found in some coastal areas of China's [[Fujian]] Province, and in Japan's [[Ryūkyū]] Islands.

In the Chinese version, the tomb itself is made to look like the [[carapace]] of a [[tortoise]]; the vertical tombstone with the name of the deceased is put where the tortoise would have had its head, at the end of the grave where the feet of the buried body are.&lt;ref name=deGroot1082/&gt; The tomb is surrounded by an [[Omega|Ω]]-shaped ridge, with its opening on the side where the tortoise's head would have been and where the tombstone is.&lt;ref name=deGroot1082/&gt;

The Ryūkyūan version has the same overall shape and layout, but on a much greater scale. The body of the "tortoise" serves as a family [[burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]].&lt;ref name=kabira/&gt;

==Significance==
[[File:Kinmen - turtleback tomb - DSCF9723.JPG|thumb|A typical turtle-back tomb in [[Kinmen]] Island off Fujian coast]]
According to [[Jan Jakob Maria de Groot|J.J.M. de Groot]], the main purpose of the horseshoe-shaped, or, more frequently, Ω-shaped ridge surrounding the tomb is to substitute for a range of hills ridge which, according to the principles of [[feng shui]], needs to protect the grave from the "noxious winds" from the three sides – the situation that is rarely naturally obtainable.&lt;ref name=deGroot941&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tumulus over the tomb naturally has somewhat turtle-like shape, considering the large size of a traditional Chinese [[coffin]], [[:File:Macau-coffin-shop-0805.jpg|its shape]], and the shallowness of the grave.&lt;ref name=deGroot1082/&gt;&lt;ref name=deGroot941/&gt; However, the tumulus is often actually covered with plaster (or, these days, concrete), decorated in such a way as to remind one of the pattern seen on a tortoise shell.&lt;ref name=deGroot1082/&gt;

It is commonly said that the tomb imitates the shape of a tortoise due to those animals' longevity, thus promising long life to the descendants of the deceased.&lt;ref name=deGroot1082/&gt;
It has been suggested (among others, by J.J.M. de Groot) that the custom of building turtle-shaped tombs may also have to do with the desire to place the grave under the influence of the heavenly warrior Xuanwu, whose symbol is the [[Black Tortoise]].&lt;ref name=deGroot1082&gt;{{harvnb|de Groot|1892|pp=1082–1083}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.sinchew.com.my/node/152069|title= 各籍貫墳墓造型 (In every land, its own kind of graves)

A legend has been recorded which ascribes to tortoises the ability to find an auspicious place for a burial. According to the legend, some time during the [[Emperor Zhenzong of Song|Xiangfu era]], a man in [[Guangdong]] who was looking for a suitable (in [[feng shui]] terms) place to bury one of his parents on a certain mountain learned that ten days prior several dozens of tortoises had brought a large dead tortoise to a certain spot and buried him there. The man found the tortoise's grave, reburied the reptile elsewhere, and used the spot to bury his own parent. Accordingly, he then had three sons born to him, two of whom earned the ''[[Imperial examinations|jinshi]]'' degrees, and all three were to occupy high positions in the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] establishment.&lt;ref name=deGroot980&gt;{{harvnb|de Groot|1892|pp=980–981}}。 De Groot quotes and translates the legend from [[:zh:s:補筆談|補筆談]] ("Additions to the Pencil Gossip"), Chapter (''quan'') 3. The location mentioned in the legend, Liangzhou ([[:zh:廉州|廉州]]) is near today's [[Beihai]], [[Guangxi]].&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering the turtle motif in tomb constructions, some authors link it with the general symbolism of a turtle in the ancient Chinese culture, with its flat [[plastron]] below and its domed [[carapace]] above, representing the shape of the universe.&lt;ref name=watson&gt;{{citation

however, unlike Fujian's turtle-back shaped tombs, ''bixi'' turtles are not placed directly above the grave. (And, unlike ''bixi''s, turtle-back graves don't have tablets standing on top of them).

When discussing the connection between the turtle/tortoise symbolism and burial practices, some authors even mention the custom of eating a variety of the traditional sweets, the [[Red Tortoise Cake#Qing Ming Festival|red turtle cakes]], at funeral feasts.&lt;ref name=watson/&gt;

The turtle-back tombs are thought to have been introduced into the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]] from Fujian in the late 17th or early 18th century ("in the interval between the careers of [[Shō Shōken]] and [[Sai On]]", according to [[Gregory Smits]]' monograph on the intellectual history of the Ryūkyū Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors give earlier dates; in particular, the tomb of [[Gosamaru]] (d. 1458) is often described as the first Ryūkyūan turtle-back tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Bridgeway Press |year=1959|title=Customs and culture of Okinawa

''The Great Loochoo: A Study of Okinawan Village Life''. University of California Press, Berkley, 1955. Page 246–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the mid-20th century, the turtleback tomb became the predominant tomb style in some parts of the Ryūkyū Islands. E.g., this was reported in [[Kabira, Okinawa|Kabira]] Village (near [[Kabira Bay]]) in [[Ishigaki Island]]. Unlike single-person turtleback tombs of Fujian, the turtleback tombs of Ryūkyū were more of a [[Burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]], where bones of many generations of a particular family could repose. Typically, the coffin with the body of a deceased member of the family would stay in one part of such a tomb for some years (3, 5, 7, or 9). After the body would have decomposed, the [[Excarnation|bones would be washed]] by young female relatives of the deceased, placed into a large [[earthenware]] jar,  and stored elsewhere in the tomb.&lt;ref name=kabira&gt;{{citation|title=The Culture of Kabira, Southern Ryūkyū Islands|author= Allan H.

In a fictionalized description of a turtleback tomb in the eponymous novel by [[Tatsuhiro Oshiro]] (where much of the action happens inside such a tomb), the tomb's floor space is 150 square feet.&lt;ref name=oshiro&gt;{{citation

Inside the tomb, urns with the bones of deceased ancestors stand on multiple rows of stone shelves, in the order of seniority. The doorway of the tomb is closed with a massive stone, serving as a door.&lt;ref name=oshiro/&gt;

In the spring of 1945, during the [[Battle of Okinawa]], many Okinawan civilians sought refuge from the naval bombardment of the island inside their ancestors' turtle-back tombs,&lt;ref name=mm/&gt;&lt;ref name=steiner&gt;{{citation|title=Okinawa and Its People—II|author=Paul E.

Later, many of these tombs were also used by the Japanese defenders of the islands.&lt;ref name=steiner/&gt;

Fighting for the turtle-back tombs is mentioned in the accounts of American soldiers as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mickmc.tripod.com/JoeP-TurtleBack.pdf Turtle-back tombs], a "scrap-book" based on photographs and letters of Corporal Joseph P. Pizzimenti, as well as various published articles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4094">'''Valentin Feldman''' (23 June 1909 – 27 July 1942) was a [[French philosopher]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] of Jewish-Russian origin. In 1942, he was murdered by the [[Nazi]]s during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Occupation of France]].

Born in [[Saint Petersburg]], he left the [[USSR]] in 1922 at the end of the Civil War. He settled in Paris and studied at the [[Lycée Henri IV]] and the [[Sorbonne]] University. A pupil of French philosopher [[Victor Basch]], he worked on [[aesthetics]] and wrote an essay, ''L'Esthétique française contemporaine'' (''French contemporan aesthetic''), Félix Alcan, 1936.

Involved in public activities as a teacher of philosophy, he supported as an antifascist the [[Front populaire]] and the [[Spanish Republic]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1937. Among his friends were [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Gaston Bachelard]] and [[Georges Politzer]]. In September 1939, he volunteered for the [[French Army]] despite suffering from a heart condition. Mobilized as a soldier in [[Rethel]], he began to write his ''Journal de guerre'' in January 1940 in the middle of the [[Phoney War]]. He survived several air attacks and bombardments during the [[Fall of France]] (May–June 1940).&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Feldman, ''Journal de guerre, 1940-1941'', Farrago, 2006, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[German Occupation]] he was a teacher in [[Dieppe]] but suffered from the first French [[Statute on Jews]] (October 1940). He was finally excluded from teaching in July 1941. By that time, he was already active in the [[French Resistance]]. From 1940, he was liaison officer between Dieppe, [[Rouen]] and [[Paris]]. After a year, he wrote the texts against the collaborationist [[Vichy regime]] and the Germans in the clandestine newspaper ''L'Avenir normand'' in Dieppe, and wrote several texts for the clandestine Parisian review ''[[La Pensée libre]]'', supervised by [[Georges Politzer]], [[Jacques Decour]] and [[Jacques Solomon]]. Becoming part of the underground, he joined a group of communist Resistance in Rouen, where he participated in actions against the German occupiers.

Arrested in February 1942 after the sabotage of a factory, he was imprisoned and tortured. Judged in Paris, he was condemned to death by a German military tribunal. He refused to sign his appeal for a reprieve. Feldman was executed by a firing squad on July 27, 1942. Addressing the German soldiers just before the salvo, he called out to them: "Imbeciles, it is for you that I die! "&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Feldman, ''Journal de guerre, 1940-1941'', Farrago, 2006, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

His last words inspired numerous French writers : [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Aragon]] were among them.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, ''Cahiers pour une morale'', Gallimard, 1983, p. 212 ; Louis Aragon, ''L'Homme communiste'', Gallimard, 1946, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; French-Swiss film-maker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] dedicated a short film to him, ''The Last Word'' (1988).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5679">'''Water marble nails''' are a [[nail art]] technique involving dropping [[nail lacquer]]s into clear water and creating a pattern on the water surface, the pattern is then transferred to the nails.

== History ==
The water marble nail technique was originally developed by professional nail technicians in Japanese nail salons. In the 1990s, it was popularized by commercial publications released by shopping centers in [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]], [[Japan]]. In 2010, water marble nail art was adapted to use acrylic [[artificial nails]] and gels.

The water marble nail technique has gained popularity across the globe through features in magazines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nailpro.com/water-marble-manicure/ | title=Water Marble Manicure | work=Nail Pro | date=24 June 2011 | author=James, Megan}}&lt;/ref&gt; websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nair|first=Sonia|title=Create Marble Nail Art Using Water|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/create-marble-nail-art-using-water.html|work=Buzzle|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denza|first=Diana|title=How To Create The Water Marble Nail Manicure|url=http://www.bettyconfidential.com/ar/ld/a/how-to-create-the-water-marble-nail-manicure.html/|work=Betty Confidential|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  polish makers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pupa.it/ita/pupa-nail-academy/Video-nail-academy/spring-flowers-con-tecnica-water-marble.aspx | title=Spring Flowers con Tecnica Water Marble | work=Pupa Milano | language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sagaraya|first=Sonal|title=DIY Marble Nail Art Stickers|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5S2QGHfOH0|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Styles ==
[[File:Water marble nail method3.JPG|thumb|Water marble nail art method, free-dragging]]
[[File:Water marble nail method2.JPG|thumb|Water marble nail art method, free-dropping]]
There are two main types of water marble nail art methods: free-dragging and free-dropping. Free-dragging is more common.

===Free-dragging===
Dragged patterns range from simple circular shapes to complicated drawings. Patterns such as marble, hearts/peacocks,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The pattern called "hearts" is also called "peacock", the name of a professional nail art technique. Drawing a "peacock" is one challenge to professional nail artists sponsored by the Japan Nailist Association.&lt;/ref&gt; animals, flowers, leaves, parallel lines, [[Psychedelic art|psychedelics]], spiderwebs, and random patterns in the style of designer [[Emilio Pucci]] are generally performed with nail lacquers and some kind of tool.

===Free-dropping===
Dropped patterns range from colored shapes to complicated drawings such as spirals and geometric designs. The free patterns are created by colored drops of nail lacquer. For free-dropping, lacquer colors are dropped straight or diagonally onto the water. The pattern floats on the surface of the water.

== Technique ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=November 2016}}
Water marble nail art requires clean water, nail lacquers for free-dropping, and a stick for drawing patterns. Before patterns are created, the nails are painted with a light-colored nail polish that establishes a good contrast with the colors chosen to create the water marble. Some techniques use a matte coat to provide contrast and maintain an even look.

After the base coat has dried, tape is put around the fingers to gather the excess nail polish after the marbling. One or two drops of colored lacquer are chosen for the design and are added to a cup of clean water. The drops will create a circle on the water surface. The next color is added on top of the circle created by the previous drop. The resulting pattern is ready for application to the nail, but it can still be modified with a stick or toothpick to create different shapes. The nail is dipped into the pattern on the water and kept under water as a [[Q-tip]] is used to "grab" the remaining polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Namuli|first1=Mary Janet|title=Water Marble Nails - What You Need To Know|url=http://www.designsauthority.com/water-marble-nails/|website=Designs Authority|accessdate=27 November 2016|date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1877">The '''Wilmington Drama League''' is a [[community theater]] group in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] in the [[United States]] that produces performing arts and owns its own theater. The theater is located at 10 West Lea Blvd. in North Wilmington, Delaware {{coord|39.761808|-75.521151|display=title}}.

In the community theater productions the actors are not paid, although the band for a musical might be.

== WDL History ==
The Wilmington Drama League's long and noble performing arts tradition traces back to 1933, when a small band of enthusiasts began staging plays on the third floor of an old grist mall at 18th and Market Streets. Seven years later, the success of this venture in community theater enabled the Drama League to relocate to its own facility on West Lea Boulevard.

Since then the play, most assuredly, has been the thing at WDL. In all its years of operation, the Drama League has mounted innumerable adult and children's theatrical productions. The talents and energies of thousands of volunteers - actors, directors, set designers and builders, lighting and sound engineers, as well as costume, makeup, and prop technicians - have transformed our stage into the compelling fantasy worlds created by playwrights ranging from [[Edward Albee]], Beckett and Chekhov to [[David Mamet]] and [[Arthur Miller]], Simon and [[Shakespeare]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and Williams.

== WDL Today ==
Today, the Wilmington Drama League does many diverse and fun activities. It performs an annual Battle of the Bands, providing opportunity to local musicians. Pillow Plays, small scale performances by youth for youth, ensure that theater will live on into the 21st century.

'''''World Builder''''' is a 2007 [[short film|short]] [[sci-fi film]] by [[Bruce Branit]]. The entire film (except for two characters) is [[computer graphics|computer generated]].

==Plot==
The film begins with the words "Program Start." In a [[green room]], a young man is lying on his back and looking at [[holographic]] pictures of himself and a young woman, presumably his wife (as we see a wedding ring on his hand). All of a sudden, a holographic timer appears on his arm, letting him know that something will happen in one hour. Closing the pictures, he stands up and gets to work.

Using a [[computer program]], he begins to make a row of tall [[box]]es. Once the first row is made, he makes a copy and puts the copy of the row of boxes across from the first. He then gets to work on adding details to each box. He adds columns, doors, and windows. Once done, he works on the appearances of the boxes to make them look like [[building]]s. He adds color and then some [[nature]]. He pays particular attention to a yellow [[flower]]. Soon, with time running out, he hastily finishes the details and hide in a doorway when the timer stops.

With time up, the boxes no longer look like [[computer model]]s but actual buildings. A door opens and the young woman from the pictures, dressed in a [[hospital gown]], emerges. She is astonished by what she sees. She walks down the [[street]], looking at the buildings and their details. Watching from his doorway, the man realizes that he forgot to do one building and it looks like a model from a computer program. He prays that she doesn't see the building. She comes his way and he hides, watching her look at the yellow flower and smile lovingly. She leaves the street with a final look back. Once she is gone, he emerges and watches his world that he created dematerialize into a new picture. It shows the woman smiling at the flower. Choking back tears, he kisses her picture. The screen goes dark, showing the words "Program Ends".

In a holographic recovery room, the young man enters. The young woman is lying on the bed, in a [[coma]] and hooked up to machines to monitor her progress. He kisses her forehead and drops into a glass of water the very flower she admired in the computer program.
