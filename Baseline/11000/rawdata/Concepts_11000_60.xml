It has been translated into Spanish, Chinese, Persian and Korean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perry's CV|url=http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/resmgr/quinnprize/cv-perry.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Dialogue on Personal Identity and Immortality|url=http://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil201/Perry.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
It deals with standard problems in the theory of [[personal identity]] in the form of a dialogue between a terminally ill university professor at a small Midwestern college,, Gretchen Weirob, and her two friends, Sam Miller and Dave Cohen. The views represented include those of [[Bernard Williams]], [[John Locke]], and [[Derek Parfit]]. The format of associating different philosophical positions with different characters in a dialogue recalls [[David Hume]]'s ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''.

  | last = Acheson
  | first = D. J.

  | year = 1990
  |page = 205
  | isbn = 0-19-859679-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In convective (or Lagrangian) form it is written: 

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{D \mathbf{u}}{D t} = \frac 1 \rho \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|ρ}} is the [[density]] at the point considered in the continuum (for which the [[continuity equation]] holds), {{math|'''σ'''}} is the [[Cauchy stress tensor|stress tensor]], and {{math|'''g'''}} contains all of the [[body force]]s per unit mass (often simply [[gravitational acceleration]]). {{math|'''u'''}} is the [[flow velocity]] vector field, which depends on time and space.

After an appropriate change of variables, it can also be written in conservation  (or Eulerian) form:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {\partial  \mathbf j }{\partial t}+ \nabla \cdot \mathbf F  = \mathbf s &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''j'''}} is the [[mass flux|momentum density]] at a given space-time point, {{math|'''F'''}} is the flux associated to the momentum density, and {{math|'''s'''}} contains all of the [[body force]]s per unit volume.

==Derivation==
Applying [[Newton's second law]] ({{mvar|i}}th component) to a [[control volume]] in the continuum being modeled gives:

:&lt;math&gt;m a_i = F_i&lt;/math&gt;

and basing on the [[Reynolds transport theorem]] and on the [[material derivative]] notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega} \rho \frac{D u_i}{D t} \, dV &amp;= \int_{\Omega} \nabla_j\sigma_i^j \, dV + \int_{\Omega} \rho g_i \, dV \\
\int_{\Omega} \left(\rho \frac{D u_i}{D t} - \nabla_j\sigma_i^j - \rho g_i \right)\, dV &amp;= 0 \\
\rho \frac{D u_i}{D t}- \nabla_j\sigma_i^j - \rho g_i &amp;= 0 \\
\frac{D u_i}{D t}- \frac {\nabla_j\sigma_i^j}{\rho} - g_i &amp;= 0 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|Ω}} represents the control volume. Since this equation must hold for any control volume, it must be true that the integrand is zero, from this the Cauchy momentum equation follows. The main step (not done above) in deriving this equation is establishing that the [[tensor derivative|derivative]] of the stress tensor is one of the forces that constitutes {{mvar|F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Acheson /&gt;

==Conservation form==
{{see also|conservation law (physics)}}
Cauchy equations can also be put in the following form:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Cauchy momentum equation''' ''(conservation form)''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial \mathbf j}{\partial t}+ \nabla \cdot \mathbf F  = \mathbf s
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

simply by defining:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} {\mathbf j}&amp;= \rho \mathbf u \\
{\mathbf F}&amp;=\rho \mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u - \boldsymbol \sigma \\
{\mathbf s}&amp;= \rho \mathbf g
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''j'''}} is the [[mass flux|momentum density]] at the point considered in the continuum (for which the [[continuity equation]] holds), {{math|'''F'''}} is the flux associated to the momentum density, and {{math|'''s'''}} contains all of the [[body force]]s per unit volume. {{math|'''u''' ⊗ '''u'''}} is the [[Dyadic product|dyad]] of the velocity.

Here {{math|'''j'''}} and {{math|'''s'''}} have same number of dimensions {{mvar|N}} as the flow speed and the body acceleration, while {{math|'''F'''}}, being a [[tensor]], has {{math|''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In 3D for example, with respect to some coordinate system, the vector {{math|'''j'''}} has 3 components, while the tensors {{math|'''σ'''}} and {{math|'''F'''}} have 9 (3x3), so the explicit forms written as matrices would be:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{\mathbf j}&amp;=\begin{pmatrix}  \rho u_1 \\ \rho u_2  \\ \rho u_3 \end{pmatrix} \\
{\mathbf s}&amp;=\begin{pmatrix}  \rho g_1 \\ \rho g_2  \\ \rho g_3 \end{pmatrix} \\
{\mathbf F}&amp;=\begin{pmatrix}
\rho u_1^2 + \sigma_{11} &amp;  \rho u_1u_2 + \sigma_{12}&amp; \rho u_1u_3 + \sigma_{13}
\\  \rho u_2 u_1 + \sigma_{12}&amp; \rho u_2^2 + \sigma_{22} &amp; \rho u_2u_3 +\sigma_{23}
\\ \rho u_3 u_1 + \sigma_{13}&amp;  \rho u_3 u_2 +\sigma_{23}&amp;  \rho u_3^2 + \sigma_{33}
\end{pmatrix}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note, however, that if symmetrical, {{math|'''F'''}} will only contain 6 ''[[degrees of freedom]]''.  And {{math|'''F'''}}'s symmetry is equivalent to {{math|'''σ'''}}'s symmetry (which will be present for the most common [[Cauchy stress tensor|Cauchy stress tensors]]), since dyads of vectors with themselves are always symmetrical.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eulerian forms it is apparent that the assumption of no deviatoric stress brings Cauchy equations to the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].

==Convective acceleration==
[[Image:ConvectiveAcceleration vectorized.svg|thumb|An example of convective acceleration. The flow is steady (time-independent), but the fluid decelerates as it moves down the diverging duct (assuming incompressible or subsonic compressible flow).]]

A significant feature of the Navier–Stokes equations is the presence of convective acceleration: the effect of time-independent acceleration of a flow with respect to space. While individual continuum particles indeed experience time dependent acceleration, the convective acceleration of the flow field is a spatial effect, one example being fluid speeding up in a nozzle.

Regardless of what kind of continuum is being dealt with, convective acceleration is a [[nonlinear]] effect. Convective acceleration is present in most flows (exceptions include one-dimensional incompressible flow), but its dynamic effect is disregarded in [[creeping flow]] (also called Stokes flow). Convective acceleration is represented by the [[nonlinear]] quantity {{math|'''u''' · ∇'''u'''}}, which may be interpreted either as {{math|('''u''' · ∇)'''u'''}} or as {{math|'''u''' · (∇'''u''')}}, with {{math|∇'''u'''}} the [[tensor derivative]] of the velocity vector {{math|'''u'''}}. Both interpretations give the same result.&lt;ref name=Emanuel&gt;{{cite book | last=Emanuel | first=G. | title=Analytical fluid dynamics | publisher=CRC Press | year=2001 | edition=second | isbn=0-8493-9114-8 | page=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advection operator vs tensor derivative ===

The convection term &lt;math&gt;D\mathbf{u}/Dt&lt;/math&gt; can be written as {{math|('''u''' · ∇)'''u'''}}, where {{math|'''u''' · ∇}} is the [[advection|advection operator]]. This representation can be contrasted to the one in terms of the tensor derivative.&lt;ref name=Emanuel/&gt; 
The tensor derivative {{math|∇'''u'''}} is the component-by-component derivative of the velocity vector, defined by {{math|[∇'''u''']&lt;sub&gt;''mi''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ∂''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, so that
:&lt;math&gt;\left[\mathbf{u}\cdot\left(\nabla \mathbf{u}\right)\right]_i=\sum_m v_m \partial_m v_i=\left[(\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}\right]_i\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lamb form===
The [[vector calculus identity]] of the [[Curl (mathematics)#Identities|cross product of a curl]] holds:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} \times \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{a} \right) =\nabla_a \left( \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{a } \right) - \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla  \mathbf{ a} \, &lt;/math&gt;

where the Feynman subscript notation {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is used, which means the subscripted gradient operates only on the factor {{mvar|a}}.

[[Horace Lamb|Lamb]] in his famous classical book Hydrodynamics (1895),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Italian|url=http://web2srv.ing.uniroma1.it/~m_valorani/GasTurbines_LM_files/DispenseTurboMacchine.pdf |last=Valorani |first=Nasuti |title=Metodi di analisi delle turbomacchine |page=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; still in print, used this identity to change the convective term of the flow velocity in rotational form, i.e. without a tensor derivative:&lt;ref&gt;See Batchelor (1967), §3.5, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld| id=ConvectiveDerivative| title = Convective Derivative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} = \nabla \left( \frac{\|\mathbf{u}\|^2}{2} \right)  + \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{u} \right) \times \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

where the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf l=\left( \nabla \times \mathbf{u} \right) \times \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[Lamb vector]]. The Cauchy momentum equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{ u}}{\partial t} + \tfrac12 \nabla \left(u^2\right) + (\nabla \times \mathbf u) \times  \mathbf u  = \frac 1 \rho \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \sigma + \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the identity:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \left( \frac {\boldsymbol \sigma}{\rho} \right) = \frac 1 \rho \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \sigma  - \frac{1}{\rho^2} \boldsymbol \sigma \cdot \nabla \rho &lt;/math&gt;

the Cauchy equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \left(\tfrac12 u^2 + \frac {\boldsymbol \sigma} \rho \right) - \mathbf g =  \frac{1}{\rho^2} \boldsymbol \sigma \cdot \nabla \rho  + \mathbf u \times (\nabla \times \mathbf u) - \frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

In fact, in case of an external [[conservative field]], by defining its potential {{mvar|φ}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \left( \tfrac12 u^2 + \phi + \frac {\boldsymbol \sigma} \rho \right)  =  \frac{1}{\rho^2} \boldsymbol \sigma \cdot \nabla \rho  + \mathbf u \times (\nabla \times \mathbf u) - \frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

In case of a steady flow the time derivative of the flow velocity disappears, so the momentum equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot  \left( \tfrac12 u^2 + \phi + \frac {\boldsymbol \sigma} \rho \right) =  \frac{1}{\rho^2} \boldsymbol \sigma \cdot \nabla \rho  + \mathbf u \times (\nabla \times \mathbf u)&lt;/math&gt;

And by projecting the momentum equation on the flow direction, i.e. along a ''[[streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]]'', the cross product disappears due to a vector calculus identity of the [[triple scalar product]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \cdot \left( \tfrac12 u^2 + \phi + \frac {\boldsymbol \sigma} \rho \right) = \frac{1}{\rho^2} \mathbf u \cdot (\boldsymbol \sigma \cdot \nabla \rho)  &lt;/math&gt;

If the stress tensor is isotropic, then only the pressure enters, and the Euler momentum equation in the steady incompressible case becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \cdot \left( \tfrac12 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho \right) = \frac{p}{\rho^2} \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho  &lt;/math&gt;

In the steady incompressible case the mass equation is simply:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho = 0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

that is, ''the mass conservation for a steady incompressible flow states that the density along a streamline is constant''. This leads to a considerable simplification of the Euler momentum equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \left( \tfrac12 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho \right)  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The convenience of defining the [[total head]] for an inviscid liquid flow is now apparent:

:&lt;math&gt; b_l \equiv \tfrac12 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in fact, the above equation can be simply written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla b_l = 0&lt;/math&gt;

That is, ''the momentum balance for a steady inviscid and incompressible flow in an external conservative field states that the total head along a streamline is constant''.

===Irrotational flows===
The Lamb form is also useful in irrotational flow, where the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the velocity (called [[vorticity]]) {{math|''ω'' {{=}} ∇ × '''u'''}} is equal to zero. In that case, the convection term &lt;math&gt;D\mathbf{u}/Dt&lt;/math&gt; reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} = \nabla \left( \frac{\|\mathbf{u}\|^2}{2} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Stresses==&lt;!--Lift (force) has a wikilink to here--&gt;
The effect of stress in the continuum flow is represented by the {{math|∇''p''}} and {{math|∇ · '''τ'''}} terms; these are [[gradient]]s of surface forces, analogous to stresses in a solid. Here {{math|∇''p''}} is the pressure gradient and arises from the isotropic part of the [[Cauchy stress tensor]]. This part is given by the [[normal stress]]es that occur in almost all situations. The anisotropic part of the stress tensor gives rise to {{math|∇ · '''τ'''}}, which usually describes viscous forces; for incompressible flow, this is only a shear effect. Thus, {{math|'''τ'''}} is the [[deviatoric stress tensor]], and the stress tensor is equal to:&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=September 2018}}

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma = - p \mathbf I + \boldsymbol \tau&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''I'''}} is the [[identity matrix]] in the space considered  and {{math|'''τ'''}} the shear tensor.

All non-relativistic momentum conservation equations, such as the [[Navier–Stokes equation]], can be derived by beginning with the Cauchy momentum equation and specifying the stress tensor through a [[constitutive relation]]. By expressing the shear tensor in terms of [[viscosity]] and fluid [[Shear velocity|velocity]], and assuming constant density and viscosity, the Cauchy momentum equation will lead to the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. By assuming [[inviscid flow]], the Navier–Stokes equations can further simplify to the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].

The divergence of the stress tensor can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau}.&lt;/math&gt;

The effect of the pressure gradient on the flow is to accelerate the flow in the direction from high pressure to low pressure.

As written in the Cauchy momentum equation, the stress terms {{mvar|p}} and {{math|'''τ'''}} are yet unknown, so this equation alone cannot be used to solve problems. Besides the equations of motion—Newton's second law—a force model is needed relating the stresses to the flow motion.&lt;ref&gt;

==External forces==
The vector field {{math|'''g'''}} represents [[body force]]s per unit mass. Typically, these consist of only [[gravity]] acceleration, but may include others, such as electromagnetic forces. In non-inertial coordinate frames, other "inertial accelerations" associated with [[Fictitious force|rotating coordinates]] may arise.

Often, these forces may be represented as the gradient of some scalar quantity {{mvar|χ}}, with {{math|'''g''' {{=}} ∇''χ''}} in which case they are called [[conservative force]]s. Gravity in the {{mvar|z}} direction, for example, is the gradient of {{math|−''ρgz''}}. Because pressure from such gravitation arises only as a gradient, we may include it in the pressure term as a body force {{math|''h'' {{=}} ''p'' − ''χ''}}. The pressure and force terms on the right-hand side of the Navier–Stokes equation become

:&lt;math&gt;-\nabla p + \mathbf{g} = -\nabla p + \nabla \chi = -\nabla \left( p - \chi \right) = -\nabla h.&lt;/math&gt;

==Nondimensionalisation==
In order to make the equations dimensionless, a characteristic length {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and a characteristic velocity {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} need to be defined. These should be chosen such that the dimensionless variables are all of order one. The following dimensionless variables are thus obtained:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\rho^* &amp;\equiv \frac \rho {\rho_0} &amp; u^* &amp;\equiv \frac u {u_0} &amp; r^* &amp;\equiv \frac r {r_0} &amp; t^*&amp;\equiv \frac {u_0}{r_0} t \\[6pt]
\nabla^* &amp;\equiv r_0 \nabla &amp; \mathbf g^* &amp;\equiv \frac {\mathbf g} {g_0} &amp; p^* &amp;\equiv \frac p {p_0} &amp; \boldsymbol \tau^* &amp;\equiv \frac {\boldsymbol \tau} {\tau_0}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution of these inverted relations in the Euler momentum equations yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\rho_0 u_0^2}{r_0}\frac{\partial \rho^* \mathbf u^*}{\partial t^*}+ \frac {\nabla^*}{r_0} \cdot \left( \rho_0 u_0^2 \rho^* \mathbf u^* \otimes \mathbf u^* + p_0 p^* \right)= - \frac {\tau_0}{r_0} \nabla^* \cdot \boldsymbol \tau^* + g_0 \mathbf g^*&lt;/math&gt;

and by dividing for the first coefficient:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf \rho^* u^*}{\partial t^*}+  \nabla^* \cdot \left(\rho^* \mathbf u^* \otimes  \mathbf u^* + \frac {p_0}{\rho_0 u_0^2} p^* \right)= - \frac {\tau_0}{\rho_0 u_0^2} \nabla^* \cdot \boldsymbol \tau^* + \frac { g_0 r_0}{u_0^2} \mathbf g^*&lt;/math&gt;

Now defining the [[Froude number]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Fr}=\frac{u_0^2}{g_0 r_0},&lt;/math&gt;

the [[Euler number (physics)|Euler number]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Eu}=\frac{p_0}{\rho_0 u_0^2},&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[coefficient of friction|coefficient of skin-friction]] or the one usually referred as 'drag' co-efficient in the field of aerodynamics:

:&lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{f}=\frac{2 \tau_0}{\rho_0 u_0^2},&lt;/math&gt;

by passing respectively to the [[conservative variables]], i.e. the [[mass flux|momentum density]] and the [[force density]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \mathbf j &amp;= \rho \mathbf u \\ \mathbf f &amp;= \rho \mathbf g \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

the equations are finally expressed (now omitting the indexes):
{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Cauchy momentum equation''' (''nondimensional conservative form'')
|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \mathbf j }{\partial t}+ \nabla \cdot \left(\frac 1 \rho \mathbf j \otimes \mathbf j + \mathrm{Eu} \, p \right) = - \frac {C_\mathrm{f}} 2  \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau + \frac 1 {\mathrm{Fr}} \mathbf f
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

Cauchy equations in the Froude limit {{math|Fr → ∞}} (corresponding to negligible external field) are named free Cauchy equations:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Free Cauchy momentum equation''' (''nondimensional conservative form'')
|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \mathbf j }{\partial t}+ \nabla \cdot \left(\frac 1 \rho \mathbf j \otimes \mathbf j + \mathrm{Eu} \, p \right) = - \frac {C_\mathrm{f}} 2  \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

and can be eventually [[conservation law|conservation equations]]. The limit of high Froude numbers (low external field) is thus notable for such equations and is studied with [[perturbation theory]].

Finally in convective form the equations are:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Cauchy momentum equation''' (''nondimensional convective form'')
|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{D \mathbf u }{ D t} + \mathrm{Eu} \, \frac 1 \rho \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \sigma = \frac 1 {\mathrm{Fr}} \mathbf g 
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4

'''Causality''' is the relationship between [[cause]]s and effects.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Celia (2003). ''The Lost Cause: Causation and the Mind–Body Problem''. Oxford: Oxford Forum. {{ISBN|0-9536772-1-4}}. Includes three chapters on causality at the microlevel in physics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bunge, Mario (1959). ''Causality: the place of the causal principle in modern science''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be fundamental to all natural [[science]], especially [[physics]]. [[Causality]] is also a topic studied from the perspectives of [[philosophy]] and [[statistics]]. Causality means that an effect cannot occur from a cause that is not in the back (past) [[light cone]] of that event. Similarly, a cause cannot have an effect outside its front (future) light cone.

==Causality in physics==

In classical physics, an effect cannot occur ''before'' its cause. In Einstein's theory of special&lt;!--To just say 'the theory of relativity' is wrong; Einstein had two theories.--&gt; relativity, causality means that an effect can not occur from a cause that is not in the back (past) [[light cone]] of that event. Similarly, a cause cannot have an effect outside its front (future) light cone. These restrictions are consistent with the grounded belief (or assumption) that causal influences cannot travel faster than the speed of light and/or backwards in time. In quantum field theory, observables of events with a spacelike relationship, "elsewhere", have to commute, so the order of observations or measurements of such observables do not impact each other.

Causality in this context should not be confused with [[Second law of motion|Newton's second law]], which is related to the conservation of momentum, and is a consequence of the spatial homogeneity of physical laws. The word causality in this context means that all effects must have specific causes&lt;ref&gt;"Causality." Cambridge English Dictionary. Accessed November 18, 2018. https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/causality&lt;/ref&gt;. As discussed below, this is a principle that is violated in some theories of modern physics.

Another requirement, at least valid at the level of human experience, is that cause and effect be mediated across space and time (requirement of ''contiguity''). This requirement has been very influential in the past, in the first place as a result of direct observation of causal processes (like pushing a cart), in the second place as a problematic aspect of Newton's theory of gravitation (attraction of the earth by the sun by means of [[Action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]]) replacing mechanistic proposals like [[The World (Descartes)#Descartes' Universe|Descartes' vortex theory]]; in the third place as an incentive to develop dynamic [[Classical field theory|field theories]] (e.g., [[Electromagnetism#Classical electrodynamics|Maxwell's electrodynamics]] and [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's general theory of relativity]]) restoring contiguity in the transmission of influences in a more successful way than did Descartes' theory.

The empiricists' aversion to metaphysical explanations (like Descartes' vortex theory) lends heavy influence against the idea of the importance of causality. Causality has accordingly sometimes been downplayed (e.g., Newton's "[[Hypotheses non fingo]]"). According to [[Ernst Mach]]&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Mach, ''Die Mechanik in ihrer Entwicklung, Historisch-kritisch dargestellt'', Akademie-Verlag, Berlin, 1988, section 2.7.&lt;/ref&gt; the notion of force in Newton's second law was [[Pleonasm|pleonastic]], tautological and superfluous. Indeed, it is possible to consider the Newtonian equations of motion of the gravitational interaction of two bodies,

:&lt;math&gt; m_1 \frac{d^2 {\mathbf r}_1 }{ dt^2} = -\frac{m_1 m_2 g ({\mathbf r}_1 - {\mathbf r}_2)}{ |{\mathbf r}_1 - {\mathbf r}_2|^3};\; m_2 \frac{d^2 {\mathbf r}_2 }{dt^2} = -\frac{m_1 m_2 g ({\mathbf r}_2 - {\mathbf r}_1) }{ |{\mathbf r}_2 - {\mathbf r}_1|^3}, &lt;/math&gt;

as two coupled equations describing the positions &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle {\mathbf r}_1(t) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle {\mathbf r}_2(t) &lt;/math&gt; of the two bodies, ''without interpreting the right hand sides of these equations as forces''; the equations just describe a process of interaction, without any necessity to interpret one body as the cause of the motion of the other, and allow one to predict the states of the system at later (as well as earlier) times.

The ordinary situations in which humans singled out some factors in a physical interaction as being prior and therefore supplying the "because" of the interaction were often ones in which humans decided to bring about some state of affairs and directed their energies to producing that state of affairs—a process that took time to establish and left a new state of affairs that persisted beyond the time of activity of the actor. It would be difficult and pointless, however, to explain the motions of binary stars with respect to each other in that way.

The possibility of such a time-independent view is at the basis of the [[deductive-nomological]] (D-N) view of scientific explanation, considering an event to be explained if it can be subsumed under a scientific law. In the D-N view, a physical state is considered to be explained if, applying the (deterministic) law, it can be derived from given initial conditions. (Such initial conditions could include the momenta and distance from each other of binary stars at any given moment.) Such 'explanation by determinism' is sometimes referred to as [[Determinism#Varieties|causal determinism]]. A disadvantage of the D-N view is that causality and determinism are more or less identified. Thus, in [[classical physics]], it was assumed that all events are caused by earlier ones according to the known laws of nature, culminating in [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]'s claim that if the current state of the world were known with precision, it could be computed for any time in the future or the past (see [[Laplace's demon]]). However, this is usually referred to as Laplace ''determinism'' (rather than `Laplace causality') because it hinges on [[Determinism#In mathematical models|determinism in mathematical models]] as dealt with in the mathematical [[Cauchy problem]]. Confusion of causality and determinism is particularly acute in [[quantum mechanics]], this theory being acausal in the sense that it is unable in many cases to identify the causes of actually observed effects or to predict the effects of identical causes, but arguably [[Quantum mechanics#Theory|deterministic]] in some interpretations (e.g. if the wave function is presumed not to actually collapse as in the [[many-worlds interpretation]], or if its collapse is due to [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]], or simply redefining determinism as meaning that probabilities rather than specific effects are determined).

In [[modern physics]], the notion of causality had to be clarified. The insights of the theory of [[special relativity]] confirmed the assumption of causality, but they made the meaning of the word "simultaneous" observer-dependent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein|A. Einstein]], "Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Koerper", ''Annalen der Physik'' '''17''', 891–921 (1905).&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the relativistic principle of causality says that the cause must precede its effect ''according to all [[inertial]] observers''. This is equivalent to the statement that the cause and its effect are separated by a [[timelike]] interval, and the effect belongs to the future of its cause. If a timelike interval separates the two events, this means that a signal could be sent between them at less than the speed of light. On the other hand, if signals could move faster than the speed of light, this would violate causality because it would allow a signal to be sent across [[spacelike]] intervals, which means that at least to some inertial observers the signal would travel ''backward in time''. For this reason, special relativity does not allow communication faster than the [[speed of light]].

In the theory of [[general relativity]], the concept of causality is generalized in the most straightforward way: the effect must belong to the future light cone of its cause, even if the [[spacetime]] is curved. New subtleties must be taken into account when we investigate causality in [[quantum mechanics]] and relativistic [[quantum field theory]] in particular. In quantum field theory, causality is closely related to the [[principle of locality]]. However, the principle of locality is disputed: whether it strictly holds depends on the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]] chosen, especially for experiments involving [[quantum entanglement]] that satisfy [[Bell's Theorem]].

Despite these subtleties, causality remains an important and valid concept in physical theories. For example, the notion that events can be ordered into causes and effects is necessary to prevent (or at least outline) [[causality paradox]]es such as the [[grandfather paradox]], which asks what happens if a time-traveler kills his own grandfather before he ever meets the time-traveler's grandmother. See also [[Chronology protection conjecture]].

===Distributed causality===

Theories in [[physics]] like the [[butterfly effect]] from [[chaos theory]] open up the possibility of a type of [[distributed parameter systems]] in causality. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} The butterfly effect theory proposes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Small variations of the initial condition of a nonlinear dynamical system may produce large variations in the long term behavior of the system."&lt;/blockquote&gt; This opens up the opportunity to understand a distributed causality.

A related way to interpret the butterfly effect is to see it as highlighting the difference between the application of the notion of causality in physics and a [[Causality|more general use of causality]] as represented by [[INUS|Mackie's INUS conditions]]. In classical (Newtonian) physics, in general, only those conditions are (explicitly) taken into account, that are both necessary and sufficient. For instance, when a massive sphere is caused to roll down a slope starting from a point of [[Mechanical equilibrium|unstable equilibrium]], then its velocity is assumed to be caused by the force of gravity accelerating it; the small push that was needed to set it into motion is not explicitly dealt with as a cause. In order to be a physical cause there must be a certain proportionality with the ensuing effect. A distinction is drawn between triggering and causation of the ball's motion. By the same token the butterfly can be seen as triggering a tornado, its cause being assumed to be seated in the atmospherical energies already present beforehand, rather than in the movements of a butterfly.

===Causal dynamical triangulation===
{{main|Causal dynamical triangulation}}
'''Causal dynamical triangulation''' (abbreviated as "CDT") invented by [[Renate Loll]], [[Jan Ambjorn|Jan Ambjørn]] and [[Jerzy Jurkiewicz]], and popularized by [[Fotini Markopoulou]] and [[Lee Smolin]], is an approach to [[quantum gravity]] that like [[loop quantum gravity]] is [[background independent]]. This means that it does not assume any pre-existing arena (dimensional space), but rather attempts to show how the [[spacetime]] fabric itself evolves. The [http://loops05.aei.mpg.de/ Loops '05] conference, hosted by many loop quantum gravity theorists, included several presentations which discussed CDT in great depth, and revealed it to be a pivotal insight for theorists. It has sparked considerable interest as it appears to have a good semi-classical description. At large scales, it re-creates the familiar 4-dimensional spacetime, but it shows spacetime to be 2-d near the [[Planck scale]], and reveals a [[fractal]] structure on slices of constant time. Using a structure called a [[simplex]], it divides spacetime into tiny triangular sections. A simplex is the generalized form of a [[triangle]], in various dimensions. A 3-simplex is usually called a [[tetrahedron]], and the 4-simplex, which is the basic building block in this theory, is also known as the pentatope, or [[pentachoron]]. Each simplex is geometrically flat, but simplices can be "glued" together in a variety of ways to create curved spacetimes. Where previous attempts at triangulation of quantum spaces have produced jumbled universes with far too many dimensions, or minimal universes with too few, CDT avoids this problem by allowing only those configurations where cause precedes any effect. In other words, the timelines of all joined edges of simplices must agree.

Thus, maybe, causality lies in the foundation of the [[spacetime]] geometry.

===Causal sets===
{{main|Causal sets}}
In causal set theory, causality takes an even more prominent place. The basis for this approach to quantum gravity is in a theorem by [[David Malament]]. This theorem states that the [[causal structure]] of a spacetime suffices to reconstruct its [[conformal class]]. So knowing the conformal factor and the causal structure is enough to know the spacetime. Based on this, [[Rafael Sorkin]] proposed the idea of Causal Set Theory, which is a fundamentally discrete approach to quantum gravity. The causal structure of the spacetime is represented as a [[Poset]], while the conformal factor can be reconstructed by identifying each poset element with a unit volume.

Acceptance and commitment therapy is probably the most well-researched of all the third-generation behavior therapy models. Its development co-occurred with that of [[relational frame theory]], with several researchers such as [[Steven C. Hayes|Steven C Hayes]] being involved with both. ACT has been argued to be based on relational frame theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2003|title=An Introduction to Relational Frame Theory: Basics and Applications|url=http://facts4u.com/free/rft_blackledge.pdf|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|publisher=BAO|volume=3|issue=4|pages=421–42|author=Blackledge, J.T.|doi=10.1037/h0099997}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is a matter of some debate within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781118489857|title=The Wiley Handbook of Contextual Behavioral Science - Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/9781118489857}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally this approach was referred to as comprehensive distancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zettle, R.D.|year=2005|title= The Evolution of a Contextual Approach to Therapy: From Comprehensive Distancing to ACT|journal=IJBCT|volume=1|issue=2|pp= 77–89|publisher=BAO|doi=10.1037/h0100736}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every practitioner mixes acceptance with a commitment to one's values. These ingredients become enmeshed into the treatment in different ways which leads to ACT being either more on the mindfulness side or more on the behavior-changing side.&lt;ref name="act"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hayes |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven C. Hayes |title=Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy (ACT) |url=http://www.contextualpsychology.org/act |publisher= ContextualPsychology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACT has, as of September 2015, been evaluated in over 130 [[randomized clinical trial]]s for a variety of client problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://contextualscience.org/state_of_the_act_evidence|title=State of the ACT Evidence {{!}} Association for Contextual Behavioral Science|website=contextualscience.org|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, when compared to other active treatments designed or known to be helpful, the effect size for ACT is a [[Cohen's d]] of around 0.6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lappalainen, R.|author2= Lehtonen, T.|author3= Skarp, E.|author4= Taubert, E.|author5=Ojanen, M. |author6= Hayes, S.C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2007|title=The impact of CBT and ACT models using psychology trainee therapists: A preliminary controlled effectiveness trial|journal=Behavior Modification|volume=31|issue=4|pages=488–511|pmid=17548542|doi=10.1177/0145445506298436|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6287169_The_Impact_of_CBT_and_ACT_Models_Using_Psychology_Trainee_Therapists_A_Preliminary_Controlled_Effectiveness_Trial}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Zettle, R.D.|author2=Rains, J.C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1989|title= Group cognitive and contextual therapies in treatment of depression|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|volume=45|issue=3|pages=438–45|pmid=2745733|doi=10.1002/1097-4679(198905)45:33.0.CO;2-L|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/20409969_Group_cognitive_and_contextual_therapies_in_treatment_of_depression}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered a medium [[effect size]].

===Functional analytic psychotherapy===
{{Main article|Functional analytic psychotherapy}}
Functional analytic psychotherapy is based on a functional analysis of the therapeutic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kohlenberg, R.J.|author2=Tsai, M.|year=1991|title=Functional Analytic Psychotherapy|location=New York|publisher=Plenum}}&lt;/ref&gt; It places a greater emphasis on the therapeutic context and returns to the use of in-session reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wulfert|year=2002|title=Can Contextual Therapies Save Clinical Behavior Analysis? |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=3|issue=3|page= 254 |publisher= BAO|doi=10.1037/h0099984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic FAP analysis utilizes what is called the ''clinically relevant behavior'' (CRB1), which is the client's presenting problem as presented in-session. Client in-session actions that improve their CRB1s are referred to as CRB2s. Client statements, or verbal behavior, about CRBs are referred to as CRB3s. In general, 40 years of research supports the idea that in-session reinforcement of behavior can lead to behavioral change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Cautilli, J.T.|author2= Riley-Tillman, C.|author3= Axelrod, S. |author4=Hineline, P.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title=The Role of Verbal Conditioning in Third Generation Behavior Therapy|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=6|issue=2|pages= 138–57|publisher= BAO|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/6/2/137.pdf&amp;productCode=pa|doi=10.1037/h0100152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral activation===
{{Main article|Behavioral activation}}
Behavioral activation emerged from a component analysis of cognitive behavior therapy. This research found no additive effect for the cognitive component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jacobson, N.S.|author2=Martell, C.R.|author3=Dimidjian, S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2001|title= Behavioral activation treatment for depression: Returning to contextual roots|journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice|volume=8|issue=3|pages=255–70|doi=10.1093/clipsy.8.3.255|url=http://www.personal.kent.edu/~dfresco/CBT_Readings/CPSP_Jacobson_et_al_BA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral activation is based on a [[matching law]] model of reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cullen, J.M.|author2=Spates, C.R.|author3=Pagoto, S. |author4= Doran, N.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2006|title= Behavioral Activation Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder: A Pilot Investigation|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=7|issue=1|pages=151–64|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/7/1/151.pdf&amp;productCode=pa|doi=10.1037/h0100150}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent review of the research supports the notion that the use of behavioral activation is clinically important for the treatment of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Spates, C.R.|author2=Pagoto, S.|author3=Kalata, A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2006|title= A Qualitative And Quantitative Review of Behavioral Activation Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=7|issue=4|pages=508–12 |publisher= BAO|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/7/4/508.pdf&amp;productCode=pa|doi=10.1037/h0100089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrative behavioral couples therapy===
{{Main article|Integrative behavioral couples therapy}}
Integrative behavioral couples therapy developed from dissatisfaction with traditional behavioral couples therapy. Integrative behavioral couples therapy looks to Skinner (1966) for the difference between contingency shaped and rule-governed behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Skinner, B.F.|year=1969|title=Contingencies of Reinforcement: A Theoretical Analysis|location=New York|publisher=Meredith Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; It couples this analysis with a thorough functional assessment of the couples relationship. Recent efforts have used radical behavioral concepts to interpret a number of clinical phenomena including [[forgiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cordova, J.|author2=Cautilli, J.D.|author3=Simon, C.|author4=Axelrod-Sabtig, R.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2006|title=Behavior Analysis of Forgiveness in Couples Therapy|journal=IJBCT|volume=2|issue=2|pages=192–213|publisher= BAO|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ804016.pdf|doi=10.1037/h0100776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community reinforcement approach and family training===
{{Main article|Community reinforcement approach and family training}}
Community reinforcement approach and family training is a model first developed by [[Nathan H. Azrin]] and Hunt. The model focuses on the use of functional behavioral assessment to reduce drinking behavior.

===Dialectical behavioral therapy===
{{Main article|Dialectical behavioral therapy}}
Dialectical behavioral therapy was created by Marsha Linehan. The model attempts to balance acceptance and change. It focuses on the use of behavior chain analysis, which combines the process of functional analysis with a greater focus on each element in the behavior stream. DBT uses groups to train specific [[social skills]] and other behavioral skills. DBT is a well-established treatment for [[borderline personality disorder]].

==Clinical formulation==
{{Main article|Clinical formulation}}
As with all [[behavior therapy]], clinical behavior analysis relies on a functional analysis of problem behavior. Depending on the clinical model this analysis draws on [[B.F Skinner]]'s model of [[Verbal Behavior]] or [[relational frame theory]].

==Professional organizations==
The [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International has a special interest group in clinical behavior analysis ABA:I.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abainternational.org/ ABA:I]&lt;/ref&gt; ABA:I serves as the core intellectual home for behavior analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Twyman, J.S.|year=2007|title=A new era of science and practice in behavior analysis|journal=Association for Behavior Analysis International: Newsletter|volume=30|issue=3|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hassert, D.L.|author2=Kelly, A.N.|author3=Pritchard, J.K.|author4=Cautilli, J.D.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2008|title=The Licensing of Behavior Analysts: Protecting the profession and the public|journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention|volume=5|issue=2|pages=8–19|publisher=BAO|doi=10.1037/h0100415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]] (ABCT) also has an interest group in [[behavior analysis]], which focuses on clinical behavior analysis.

The [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]] is devoted to third-generation therapies and basic research on derived relational responding and relational frame theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contextualpsychology.org Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

“'''Control''' has been one of the most widely explored topics in the social and psychological sciences”&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, Bachrach, Rapp, Grewal, and Beitelspacher. (2015).''Journal of Applied Psychology.''Vol. 100, No. 4, 1076&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychology]] it can refer to one’s perception regarding her/his ability to achieve outcomes (Perceived Control), the ability to select one’s thoughts and actions (cognitive control), the ability to regulate one’s feelings or attitudes toward something (emotional control), one’s ability to act on prescribed behaviors (motivational control), the amount of control one seeks within a relationship (control desire), the ability to inhibit thoughts or actions in favor of others (inhibitory control), selecting one’s social environment for one’s benefit (social control), the attempt to regulate impulses or attentional processes (Ego control), and the ability to regulate how much effort one invests into a goal (effortful control).

==Perceived control==

'''Perceived control''' in [[psychology]] is a “person’s belief  that he or she is capable of obtaining desired outcomes, avoiding undesired outcomes, and achieving goals.” High perceived control is associated with better health, relationships, and adjustment. Strategies for restoring perceived control are called '''Compensatory control strategies.'''&lt;ref&gt;Landau, Kay and Whitson. (2015). “Compensatory Control and the Appeal of a Structured World”. ''Psychological Bulletin'', Vol. 141, No. 3, p. 695&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control desire==

'''Control desire''' in the context of a sales relationship refers to the amount of control a customer wants within the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, Bachrach, Rapp, Grewal, and Beitelspacher. (2015).''Journal of Applied Psychology.''Vol. 100, No. 4, 1073-1088&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive control==

'''Cognitive control''' in psychology describes “the ability to control one’s thoughts and actions.” It is also known as ''controlled processing, executive attention, and supervisory attention''. Controlled behaviors are guided by maintenance, updating, and representing task goals, and inhibiting information irrelevant to the task goal.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Radvansky, Lorsbach and Armendarez. (2015). “Event Structure and Cognitive Control”. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology.''Vol. 41, No. 5, 1374-1387&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotional control==

'''Emotional control''' is a term from the [[Self-control|self-regulatory]] [[psychology]] literature and refers to “the ability to self-manage or regulate attitudes and feelings that directly affect participant receptiveness to, and implementation of, training activities.”&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Oh, Le and Button. (2009). “Intervention Effects on College Performance and Retention as Mediated by Motivational, Emotional, and Social Control Factors: Integrated Meta-Analytic Path Analysis.” ''Journal of Applied Psychology'' Vol. 94, No. 5, 1163-1184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivational control==

'''Motivational control''' in [[psychology]] “refers to the [[Self-control|self-regulatory]] mechanism by which individuals are able to act on prescribed behaviors to implement training activities.” For example, a student who studies for an hour each morning for two months before a test, whether or not the student likes studying.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Oh, Le and Button. (2009). “Intervention Effects on College Performance and Retention as Mediated by Motivational, Emotional, and Social Control Factors: Integrated Meta-Analytic Path Analysis.” ''Journal of Applied Psychology'' Vol. 94, No. 5, 1163-1184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inhibitory control==

'''Inhibitory control or “IC”''' in [[psychology]] it refers to a type of [[self-control|self-regulation]] defined as “the ability to inhibit prepotent thoughts or actions flexibly, often in favor of a subdominant action, typically in goal-directed behavior”.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, Hume, Allan, Farrington and Lonigan. (2014). “Relations Between inhibitory Control and the Development of Academic Skills in Preschool and Kindergarten: A Meta-Analysis”. '' Developmental Psychology''. Vol. 50, No. 10, 2368.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two types of IC: hot and cold. Hot IC involves activities or tasks related to emotion regulation, and cold IC involves abstract activities or tasks.

==Social control==

'''Social control''' is [[learning psychology]] “refers to an individual’s skills in engaging the social environment in ways that help to support and reinforce his or her learning activities.”&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Oh, Le and Button. (2009). “Intervention Effects on College Performance and Retention as Mediated by Motivational, Emotional, and Social Control Factors: Integrated Meta-Analytic Path Analysis.” ''Journal of Applied Psychology'' Vol. 94, No. 5, 1163-1184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ego control==

'''Ego control''' in [[psychology]] refers to “the efforts of the individual to control ‘thoughts, emotions, impulses or appetites… task performances [and] attentional processes.’ ”&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener, Murawski and Kucharski. (2008). “Using the Delay Discounting Task to test for failures in ego control in substance abusers.”''Psychoanalytic Psychology''Vol. 25, 3, 533-549&lt;/ref&gt; Failure of ego control is seen as a central problem in individuals who suffer from substance abuse disorders.

==Situational control==

'''Situational control''' in [[psychology]] is part of [[leadership psychology]] that refers to “the degree to which the situation provides the leader “with potential influence over the group’s behavior”.&lt;ref&gt;Fiedler, F.E. (1971). “Validation and extension of the contingency model of leadership effectiveness: A review of empirical findings. ''Psychological Bulletin'', '''76''', 129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effortful control==

'''Effortful control''' in [[psychology]] refers to a type of [[Self-control|self regulation]]. It is a broader construct than inhibitory control, and encompasses working memory and attention shifting.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, Hume, Allan, Farrington and Lonigan. (2014). “Relations Between inhibitory Control and the Development of Academic Skills in Preschool and Kindergarten: A Meta-Analysis”. '' Developmental Psychology''. Vol. 50, No. 10, 2368-2379.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17025">The '''EVR model''' is a [[life cycle assessment]] based method to analyse consumption patterns, business strategies and design options in terms of eco-efficient value creation. Next to this it is used to compare products and service systems (e.g. [[benchmarking]]).

The '''eco-costs/value ratio''' ('''EVR''') is an indicator to reveal sustainable and un[[sustainable consumption]] patterns of people. The [[eco-costs]] is an indicator for the environmental pollution of the products people buy, the value is the price they pay for it in our free market economy. Example: When somebody spends 1000 euro per month on housing (in Europe: EVR approx. 0,3) it is less harmful for the environment than when 1000 euro is spend on diesel (in Europe: EVR approx. 1,0). See section 3.1.

The EVR is also relevant for business strategies, because companies are facing the slow but inevitable internalization of environmental costs. At the moment the costs of products don't take into account the environmental damage caused by these products. This "pollution is for free" mentality is less and less accepted by communities.

The EVR makes companies aware of the relative importance of the environmental pollution of their products, and the relative risk they run that future production costs will increase because of this internalization of environmental costs. 
By using the EVR, companies can make decisions for their product portfolio: abandon products with low value and high environmental costs and stimulate products with high value and low environmental costs. See sections 2.3 and 3.2.

[[File:EVR Value costs ecocosts chain.gif|600px|right|thumb|Figure 1: The basic idea of combining the economic and ecological chain: 'the EVR chain'.]]

==Background information==
The EVR model has been introduced in 1998 and published in 2000–2004 in the International Journal of LCA,&lt;ref&gt;Vogtländer J.: [http://www.springerlink.com/content/m464712867ph38k0/fulltext.pdf "The virtual eco-costs '99 A single LCA-based indicator for sustainability and the eco-costs-value ratio (EVR) model for economic allocation"], International Journal of LCA, 2001, 6 (3) pp 157-166&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Journal of Cleaner Production.&lt;ref&gt;Vogtländer J.: [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&amp;_imagekey=B6VFX-44CVVBS-8-11&amp;_cdi=6022&amp;_user=499885&amp;_orig=search&amp;_coverDate=02%2F28%2F2002&amp;_sk=999899998&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLbVlz-zSkzV&amp;md5=9fcd2ef852be07c9b7de3b4fb3b9b3eb&amp;ie=/sdarticle.pdf " Communicating the eco-efficiency of products and services by means of the eco-costs/value model"], Journal of Cleaner Production 10, 2002, pp 57-67&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of EVR is based on [[eco-costs]]. In 2007, 2012 and in 2017, the eco-costs system was updated. General databases of eco-costs are provided (open source) at [http://www.ecocostsvalue.com www.ecocostsvalue.com] of Delft University of Technology (the Netherlands). In 2010 a book named "LCA-based assessment of sustainability: the Eco-costs/Value Ratio (EVR)"&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Vogtländer;[http://www.vssd.nl/hlf/b004.htm ''LCA-based assessment of sustainability: the Eco-costs/Value Ratio (EVR)''], VSSD, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was published containing the most important articles about the EVR.

==Working principle==

===The model===
EVR = Eco-costs/value. The basic idea of the EVR model is to link the '[[value chain]]'&lt;ref&gt;Porter, M. E.: Competitive advantage, Free Press, New York 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  to the ecological product chain. In the value chain, the added value (in terms of money) and the added costs are determined for each step of the product 'from cradle to grave'. Similarly, the ecological impact of each step in the product chain is expressed in terms of money, the so-called '[[eco-costs]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Vogtländer J.G. [http://www.ecocostsvalue.com www.ecocostsvalue.com] Website. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; See Figure 1. Note that there exists also a Porter chain from the right to the left in Figure 1, starting with waste and adding value by recycling. In this way the Porter chain becomes circular.

===Eco-costs===
[[Eco-costs]] express the amount of environmental burden of a product on basis of prevention of that burden. They are the marginal prevention costs (money) which should be made to reduce the environmental pollution and materials depletion in our world to a level which is in line with the carrying capacity of our earth.

As such, the eco-costs are virtual costs, since they are not yet integrated in the real life costs of current production chains (Life Cycle Costs). The eco-costs should be regarded as hidden obligations.
 
For example: for each 1000&amp;nbsp;kg {{CO2}} emission, one should invest €135,- in offshore windmill parks (or other {{CO2}} reduction systems at that price or less). When this is done consequently, the total {{CO2}} emissions in the world will be reduced by 65% compared to the emissions in 2008. As a result global warming will stabilise. In short: "the eco-costs of 1000kg {{CO2}} are € 135,-".
Similar calculations can be made on the environmental burden of acidification, eutrification, summer smog, fine dust, eco-toxicity, and the use of metals, fossil fuels and land (nature).

Eco-costs are used in Life Cycle Assessment, [[Life Cycle Assessment|LCA]], to assess the environmental performance of different materials, processes and End of Life methods.

===Of products===
[[File:EVR Eco-costs costs value bars.gif|350px|right|thumb|Figure 2: The decomposition of 'virtual eco-costs', costs and value of a product.]]

The EVR combines eco-cost and value to see whether a product will be successful. The product should have low environmental impact in its lifecycle (low eco-costs) and an attractive value for consumers.  The value here is the market value (perceived customer value, also called fair price).  Figure 2 depicts the three dimensions of a product: the value, the costs and the eco-costs.

It is a trend in society that heavy pollution of industry is not accepted anymore by the inhabitants of a country. This results in stricter regulations by countries (e.g. tradable emission rights, enforcement of best available technologies, eco-taxes, etc.). Eco-costs will then become part of the internal production costs. This internalizing of eco-costs might be a threat to a company, but it might also be an opportunity: “When my product has less eco-burden than that of my competitor, my product can withstand stricter regulations of the government. So this characteristic of low eco-costs of my product is a competitive edge.” 
To analyse the short term and the long term market prospects of a product or a product service combination (Product Service System, PSS), each product or PPS can be positioned in the portfolio matrix of Figure 3. The basic idea of the product portfolio matrix is the notion that a product, service or PSS is characterized by: 
* its short term market potential: high value/costs ratio
* its long term market requirement: low eco-costs.

[[File:product portfolio EVR.png|350px|left|thumb|Figure 3: Product portfolio matrix for EVR product strategy of companies.]]In terms of product strategy, the matrix results in 3 strategic directions:

# enhance the value/costs ratio of a green design to create a bigger market
# lower the eco-costs of current successful products to make it fit for future markets
# abandon products with a low value/ costs ratio (not much profit, small market) and high eco-costs

For many 'green designs', the usual problem is that they have a low current value/costs ratio. In most of the cases the production costs are higher than the production costs of the classic solution, in some cases even the (perceived) quality is poor. There are two ways to do something about it:

a. enhance the (perceived) quality of the product

b. attach to the product a service (create a PSS) in a way that the value of the bundle of the product and the service is more than the value of its components.

For a product which has a good present value/costs ratio, but high eco-costs, the product and the production process have to be redesigned to lower the eco-costs. This road towards [[sustainability]] is often far more promising than the strategy of enhancing the value/costs ratio of a green design. [[File:Figure 4 product strategy matrix.jpg|330px|right|thumb|Figure 4: Design strategies to enhance the EVR of a product.]]The reason is that the economies of scale for production and distribution are available and that the new product is marketed to an existing client base which is used to the brand name, the quality standards, the service system, etc.

Note: The most common fear of business managers is that their new green products end up with a deteriorated value/costs ratio, and hence will have a cumbersome position in the market. The stability of the governmental policy plays an important role here. When governmental regulations which level the playing field are postponed or even abandoned, proactive companies with sound product strategies are harmed. This can cause severe damage to the transition process and may lead to reluctance of players to move proactively in the future.
 
The most successful design options are depicted in Figure 4. The best design strategy is: 
* to increase value where value is high
* to decrease the eco-costs where the eco-costs are high

==Use==

===De-linking===
[[File:Consumers spending NL.JPG|340px|right|thumb|Figure 5. The consumer's side: preference of expenditures in Dutch households.]]
[[File:Spending.JPG|340px|right|thumb|Figure 6. The EVR and the total expenditures of all consumers in the EU25 (from EIPRO)]]
In economics, de-linking (also known as [[Decoupling (organizational studies)|decoupling]]) is often used in the context of economic production and environmental quality. In this context, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without corresponding increases in environmental pressure. In many economies increasing production (GDP) would involve increased pressure on the environment. An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth, without also experiencing a worsening of environmental conditions, is said to be de-linked.

There is a consumer's side of the de-linking of economy and ecology. Under the assumption that most of the households spend in their life what they earn in their life, the total EVR of the spending of households is the key towards sustainability. Only when this total EVR of the spending gets lower, the eco-costs related to the total spending can be reduced even at a higher level of spending. There are two ways of achieving this: 
* At the production side: the improvement of eco-efficiency ('lowering EVR') of products and services by the industry
* At the consumer's side: the change of lifestyle of customers in the direction of 'low EVR' products.

At the production side, society is heading in the right direction: gradually, industrial production is achieving higher levels of the value/costs ratio and is at the same time becoming cleaner. At the consumer's side, however, society is suffering from the fact that the consumers preferences are heading in the wrong direction: towards products and services with an unfavourable EVR (like driving in SUVs, more kilometres, intercontinental flights for holidays). These unfavourable preferences can be concluded from Figure 5.

Figure 5 shows that people in the Netherlands (and probably in the other EC countries as well) spend relatively more money on cars and holidays when they have more money available. Other studies show that people tend to have intercontinental holidays at the moment they can afford it. This shift in consumer spending will become a big problem in the near future, since the EVR of e.g. housing and health care is much lower than the EVR of transport and (inter)continental holidays by plane. 
Figure 6 shows the EVR (= ecocosts/price) on the Y/axis as a function of the cumulative expenditures of all products and services of all citizens in the EU 25 on the X-axis. The data is from the EIPRO study of the European Commission (EIPRO = environmental impact of products).

The area underneath the curve is proportional to the total eco-costs of the EU25. Basically there are two strategies to reduce the area under the curve: - ask industry to reduce the eco-costs of their products (this will shift the curve downward) - try to reduce expenditures of consumers in high end of the curve, and let them spend this money at the low end of the curve (this will shift the middle part of the curve to the right). 
The question is now how designers and engineers can contribute to this required shift towards sustainability and what this means to product portfolio strategies of companies. The solution is Eco-efficient Value Creation.

===Eco-efficient value creation===
[[File:double objective EVR.png|350px|right|thumb|Figure 7: The double objectvive for design &amp; engineering: less eco-costs, more value.]]
The way towards sustainability requires a double aim in product innovation, see Figure 7: 
* lower eco-costs, and at the same time
* higher value (a higher market price).

We call this: eco-efficient value creation. 
The reason we need value creation for eco-efficient products is threefold:

# the higher price in the market is required to cover the higher production cost of green products (note that a higher price is only accepted by the consumer when the perceived value is higher, otherwise the consumer will not buy the product)
# the higher price prevents the rebound effect
# lowering the EVR appears the key to a sustainable development at the level of countries (Figure 6)

Below, an example of eco-efficient value creation is given, which is the introduction of the [[Lexus RX (XU30)|Lexus RX 400h]] in the USA: 
* the customer value has increased, by emphasising its combined power and comfort (from the advertisement in the US: "……While it may have a V6 engine under the hood, the extra boost from the electric-drive motor gives the vehicle the acceleration power of a V8……. and the noise levels in Lexus hybrid vehicles have been reduced even more")
*  the eco-costs of driving are lower, since its excellent overall fuel economy

Note that the acceleration of a car is an interesting issue in terms of value. High acceleration is associated with expensive sports cars (Porsche, Ferrari). But people who buy these fast cars hardly use it. For these people acceleration is more part of the image of the product than it is part of the product qualities they use on a daily basis. So reducing the acceleration is the wrong strategy: it eliminates the extra value, and it hardly reduces the overall eco-costs in practice.

===Environmental benchmarking in LCA===
Life cycle assessment (LCA) is the generally accepted method to compare two (or more) alternative products or services. A prerequisite for such a comparison is that the functionality ('functional unit') and the quality of the alternatives are the same (you cannot compare [[apples and oranges]] in the classical LCA). In cases of product design and architecture, however, this prerequisite seems to be a fundamental flaw in the application of LCA: the designer or architect is aiming at a better quality (in the broad sense of the word: including intangible aspects like beauty and image), so the new design never has the same quality. In some cases the functionality of the design is not the same, since the design solution is limited by a maximum budget, in some cases the functionality is the same, but the higher quality results in a higher price. In all these cases a single indicator in LCA (like the eco-costs) is not suitable for environmental benchmarking.
In these cases however, it does make sense to compare the design alternatives on the basis of the eco-costs/value ratio (EVR), where the value is the perceived customer value (the fair price). See section 3.1 on Delinking.

Example 1. Different types of armchairs differ in terms of comfort, aesthetics, etc. rather than in terms of functionality. A classical LCA (with a single indicator like eco-costs, carbon footprint, etc.) does not make sense here. Selection on the basis of EVR, however, is the key to a sustainable consumption pattern. The chair with the lowest EVR is the best solution in terms of sustainability.

Example 2. In LCA, the comparison of a new building and a renovated building is in the majority of cases not possible, since, in practice, both solutions differ in almost all quality aspects (tangible as well as intangible). However, the solution with lowest EVR is the best in terms of sustainable consumption.

Note that the renovated building is the best solution in most of the cases, because it has the lowest EVR in the production phase. However, in some cases the renovated building is not the best solution, because of unfavourable energy consumption (high EVR) in the use phase.

'''Employee Monitoring''' is the act of employers [[surveillance|surveying]] [[employee]] activity through different surveillance methods. Organizations engage in employee monitoring for different reasons such as to track [[Performance management|performance]], to avoid legal liability, to protect [[trade secrets]], and to address other security concerns. This practice may impact [[Job satisfaction|employee satisfaction]] due to its impact on the [[privacy|privacy of the employees]]. Among organizations, the extent and methods of employee monitoring differ.[1]

== Surveillance Methods ==

Due to the use of company computers, telephones, workspaces, and software, employers can have access to the daily activities of their employees. These devices are used to monitor the organizations' employees. Common methods of monitoring include software monitoring, telephone tapping, video surveillance, email monitoring, and location monitoring.

'''Software monitoring''' can occur if employees use company computers for their work, companies often utilize employee monitoring software that allows them to track what their employees are doing on the computers. Such as, what the speed of typing is, what mistakes are made, what applications were used, and what specific keys were pressed.

{{Main articles|Employee monitoring software}}

'''Telephone tapping''' can be used to recover employees' phone call details and conversations. These can be recorded during monitoring. The number of calls, the duration of each call, and the idle time between calls, can all go into an automatic log for analysis by the company.&lt;ref&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/231233456&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main articles|Telephone tapping}}

'''Video surveillance''' can provide video feed of employee activities that are passed through to a central location where they are monitored live by another person. These can be recorded and stored for future reference which some believe is the most accurate way to monitor employees. "This is a benefit because it provides an unbiased method of performance evaluation and prevents the interference of a manager's feelings in an employee's review (Mishra and Crampton, 1998)." Management can review the performance of an employee by checking the surveillance to detect and potentially prevent problems.[1]

{{Main articles|Video Surveillance}}

'''Email monitoring''' gives employers the ability to look at email messages sent or received by their employees. Emails can be viewed and recovered even if they had been previously deleted. In the United States, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act provides some privacy protections regarding monitoring of employees' email messages and other electronic communications. See Electronic Communications Privacy Act § Employee Privacy.

{{Main articles|Email Surveillance}}

'''Location monitoring''' can occur and be used for employees that do not work in a static location. Supervisors may choose to track their location. Common examples of companies that use location monitoring are delivery and transportation industries. In some of these cases, the employee monitoring is incidental as the location is tracked for other purposes, that can help improve customer satisfaction. Employees' phone call details and conversations can be recorded during monitoring. The number of calls, the duration of each call, and the idle time between calls, can all go into an automatic log for analysis by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SHERMAN |first=MARK |title=GOV'T OBTAINS WIDE AP PHONE RECORDS IN PROBE |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/govt-obtains-wide-ap-phone-records-probe |accessdate=May 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514001309/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/govt-obtains-wide-ap-phone-records-probe |archivedate=May 14, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Key logging''', or keystroke logging, is a process that records the keys a user is typing on the keyboard in order. These programs can also capture screenshots when triggered by predefined keywords. Some see it as violating workplace privacy and it's also notorious for being used with malicious intent. Loggers collect and store passwords, bank account information, private messages, credit card numbers, PIN numbers, and usernames.

==Legality==
Employee monitoring often is in conflict with [[workplace privacy|employees' privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mishra, J. M. |author2= Crampton, S. M. |last-author-amp=yes |year=1998|title=Employee monitoring: Privacy in the workplace?|journal=SAM Advanced Management Journal (07497075)|volume=63 |issue=3 |page=4|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-21160636.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monitoring often collects work-related activities, but it can also collect employee's personal information that is not linked to their work. Monitoring in the workplace may put employers and employees at odds because both sides are trying to protect personal interests. Employees want to maintain their privacy while employers want to ensure company resources aren't misused. In any case, companies can maintain ethical monitoring policies by avoiding indiscriminate monitoring of employees' activities.&lt;ref&gt; Burks, F. ''Ethical Issues &amp; Employer Monitoring Internet Usage''. Chron.com, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The employee needs to understand what is expected of them while the employer needs to establish that rule.

With employee monitoring, there are many guidelines that one must follow and put in place to protect the company and the individual. Some following cases are ones that have shaped the certain rules and regulations that are in effect today. For instance, in Canada, it is illegal to perform invasive monitoring, such as reading an employee's emails, unless it can be shown that it is a necessary precaution and there are no other alternatives. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-rules-employees-have-right-to-privacy-on-work-computers/article4625660/&lt;/ref&gt; In Maryland, everyone in the conversation must give consent before the conversation can be recorded. The state of California requires that the monitored conversations have a beep at certain intervals or there must be a message informing the caller that the conversations may be recorded. However, this does not inform the company representative which calls are being recorded. Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Colorado and New Jersey have laws relating to when a conversation can be recorded. "Lawyers generally advise that one way for businesses to avoid liability for monitoring employees’ online activities is to take all necessary steps to eliminate any reasonable expectation of privacy that employees may have concerning their use of company email and other communications systems." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiakm.org/ojakm/articles/2013/volume1_2/OJAKM_Volume1_2pp44-55.pdf], Yerby, Johnathan. "Legal and Ethical Issues of Employee Monitoring." ''Online Journal of Applied Knowledge Management''. &lt;/ref&gt; Businesses makes employee monitoring a known tool that supervisors use to avoid any potential legal issues that may arise. They will announce this during new hire orientation, in a staff meeting, or even in a workplace contract that employees sign either at the time of hire or after a form of misconduct.

==Legal Uses==

Businesses use employee monitoring for various reasons. The follow is a list that includes, but is not limited to:

* Find needed business information when the employee is not available.
* Protect [[data security|security]] of proprietary information and data.
* Prevent or investigate possible criminal activities by employees.
* Prevent personal use of employer facilities.
* Check for violations of company policy against sending an offensive or pornographic email.
* Investigate complaints of [[workplace harassment|harassment]].
* Check for illegal software.

According to Computer Monitoring: The Hidden War Of Control,"The employer of today has the ability and legal right to read e-mail, review files stored on a company computer, examine computer usage, and track individual employee computer activities. The idea of anonymous actions is an illusion. Every action between a network and the computers connected to it can be tracked. Every action by an individual worker on a computer can be tracked, analyzed and used against the employee. The protections and freedoms guaranteed by the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] are there to protect the individual from the Government and do not generally apply to the normal employee/employer relationship."&lt;ref&gt;Kevin, P. P., &amp; Tammy, Y. A. (2011). Computer monitoring: The hidden war of control. International Journal of Management and Information Systems, 15(1), 49-58. Retrieved from http://journals.cluteonline.com/index.php/IJMIS/article/view/1595&lt;/ref&gt; To benefit the business, employers have the ability to monitor employees whenever they feel is necessary.

==Legal Issues==
In January 2016, European Court of Human Rights issued a landmark ruling in the case of Bărbulescu v Romania (61496/08) regarding monitoring of employees’ computers. The employee Mr. Bărbulescu accused the employer of violating his rights to ‘private life’ and ‘correspondence’ set in the Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{"itemid":["001-159906"]}/|author=EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, JUDGMENT |title= CASE OF BĂRBULESCU v. ROMANIA (Application no. 61496/08) |date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
But the Court stated that the employer had every right to monitor the employee’s computer in this case due to the fact that such monitoring was implemented to ensure that there is no breach of company policy. This historic ruling has confirmed that it is not unreasonable for employers to monitor their employees’ computer activity and such monitoring does not violate their human rights.

A year later, in July 2017, German court also ruled that computer monitoring of employees is reasonable but the use of keylogging software is excessive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/companies-cant-use-keyloggers-to-spy-on-employees-says-german-court/|author=Catalin Cimpanu|title= Companies Can't Use Keyloggers to Spy on Employees, Says German Court |date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Employee monitoring software developers warn that in each case it is still recommended to advise a legal representative and the employees should give a written agreement with such monitoring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clevercontrol.com/companies-monitor-employees/#Problems_with_Law |title= How Companies Monitor Their Employees |date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majority of instances are a case by case situation and is hard to treat all the issues and problems as one. With the ever growing laws, employers shape their guidelines around the new rules and regulations that are formed in court cases.

==Financial benefits==
Employee Monitoring can be used to monitor the safety and productivity of the employees but it also may help businesses financially. From the dishonest unethical employee who steals time and money from the business to the redefining of unprofitable processes in monitoring employee actions, employee monitoring allows for the growth of financial profits from a small investment. The monitoring of employees can help in the protection of employees and it can help as protection in litigation by employees for job-related issues such as failing to perform, illegal activities and harassment claims. According to the American Management Association, almost half (48%) of the companies surveyed use video monitoring to counter theft, violence, and sabotage. Only 7% use video surveillance to track employees' on-the-job performance. Most employers notify employees of anti-theft video surveillance (78%) and performance-related video monitoring (89%), (Retrieved from the article The Latest on Workplace Monitoring and Surveillance on humanresources.about.com)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Training Solutions for Individuals, Organizations and Government Agencies |url=http://humanresources.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;zTi=1&amp;sdn=humanresources&amp;cdn=money&amp;tm=27&amp;f=00&amp;su=p284.13.342.ip_p554.23.342.ip_&amp;tt=2&amp;bt=4&amp;bts=4&amp;zu=http%3A//www.amanet.org/ }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in ''Labour Economics'', it has been argued that forbidding employers to track employees' on-the-job performance can make economic sense according to efficiency wage theory, while surveillance to prevent illegal activities should be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Workplace surveillance, privacy protection, and efficiency wages|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537104000764|journal = Labour Economics|date = 2005|pages = 727–738|volume = 12|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.labeco.2004.06.001|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An indirect way that companies can be affected financially through employee monitoring is that they can be sure they are billing clients correctly. According to "Business 2 Community", inaccurately billing clients is very possible because of the human error. These inaccuracies can cause a dispute between a company and a client which could eventually lead to the client terminating its business with the company. This sort of termination will not only hurt the company's revenue stream but also its reputation with other clients or potential clients. The suggested solution to this problem is a time tracking software to correctly monitor the number of hours a client spends with an employee. &lt;ref&gt; {https://www.business2community.com/human-resources/6-benefits-of-employee-monitoring-0134730}, Vessella, Victoria. "6 Benefits of Employee Monitoring." ''Business 2 Community''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnathan Yerby said, "The enormity of potential productivity loses, as reported by Court (2004), is approximately one million dollars
annually for a company with 500 employees surfing the Internet for just a half hour a day." &lt;ref&gt;{http://www.iiakm.org/ojakm/articles/2013/volume1_2/OJAKM_Volume1_2pp44-55.pdf], Yerby, Johnathan. "Legal and Ethical Issues of Employee Monitoring." ''Online Journal of Applied Knowledge Management''.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does employee monitoring prevent theft of money and resources, but it also prevents theft of time and to make sure people are doing what they are supposed to be doing in the workplace. This is used a lot during the Holidays with online shopping, as well as during [[March Madness]]. Employees will spend their time using their work time for personal uses and employee monitoring helps regulate this.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8246">{{nihongo|'''Ero guro nansensu''', frequently shortened to '''ero guro''' or just '''guro''', |エログロ|ero-guro}} is a literary and artistic movement originating c. 1930 in Japan.&lt;ref name="ucla"&gt;Silverberg, Miriam Rom. “By Way of a Preface: Defining ''Erotic Grotesque Nonsense''”. Galley copy of the preface for ''Erotic Grotesque Nonsense: The Mass Culture of Japanese Modern Times''. December 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Ero guro puts its focus on eroticism, sexual corruption, and decadence.&lt;ref name="ucla" /&gt; While ero guro is a specific movement, many of its components can be found throughout Japanese history and culture.

The term itself is an example of ''[[wasei-eigo]]'', a Japanese combination of English words or abbreviated words: ''ero'' from "ero(tic)", ''guro'' from "gro(tesque)", and ''nansensu'' from "nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyler|first=William J.|title=Introduction: making sense of ''nansensu''|journal=Japan Forum|date=27 Apr 2009|volume=21|issue=1 (Special Issue: URBAN NONSENSE)|pages=1–10|doi=10.1080/09555800902856932|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09555800902856932|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In actuality the "grotesqueness" implied in the term refers to things that are malformed, unnatural, or horrific.&lt;ref name="ucla" /&gt; Items that are pornographic and bloody are not necessarily ''ero guro'', and vice versa. The term is often used incorrectly by western audiences to mean "[[Graphic violence|gore]]"—depictions of horror, blood, and guts.

==History==
Ero guro nansensu, characterized as a "prewar, bourgeois cultural phenomenon that devoted itself to explorations of the deviant, the bizarre, and the ridiculous,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reichert | first = Jim | title = Deviance and Social Darwinism in Edogawa Ranpo's Erotic-Grotesque Thriller Koto no Ōni | journal = Journal of Japanese Studies | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages =113–114 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.2307/3591938 | author2 = Reichert, Jim | publisher = Journal of Japanese Studies, Vol. 27, No. 1 | jstor = 3591938}}&lt;/ref&gt; manifested in the popular culture of [[Taishō period|Taishō]] Tokyo during the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Buruma"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ian Buruma|last=Buruma|first=Ian|title=Inventing Japan, 1853–1964|pages=67–68|year=2003|publisher=The Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=0-679-64085-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Ian Buruma]] describes the social atmosphere of the time as "a skittish, sometimes nihilistic hedonism that brings [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] Berlin to mind."&lt;ref name="Buruma"/&gt; Its roots go back to artists such as Tsukioka [[Yoshitoshi]], who, besides erotic [[Shunga (art)|shunga]], also produced woodblock prints showing decapitations and acts of violence from Japanese history. [[Ukiyo-e]] artists such as [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] presented similar themes with bondage, rape and erotic [[crucifixion]].

Ero guro's first distinct appearance began in 1920s and 1930s [[Japanese literature]]. The [[Sada Abe|Sada Abe Incident]] of 1936, where a woman [[Erotic asphyxiation|strangled]] her lover to death and [[castration|castrated]] his corpse, struck a chord with the ero guro movement and came to represent that genre for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston|first=William|title=Geisha, Harlot, Strangler, Star: A Woman, Sex, and Morality in Modern Japan|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-13052-X|pages=11, 114, 160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other like activities and movements were generally suppressed in Japan during [[World War II]], but re-emerged in the postwar period, especially in [[manga]] and [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;McLelland, Mark. [http://wwwsshe.murdoch.edu.au/intersections/issue12/mclelland.html "A Short History of &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Hentai''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the ero guro movement's influence expanded into parts of Japanese [[Theatre of Japan|theatre]], [[Japanese art|art]], [[manga]], and eventually into film and music.

==Later influences==
Ero guro is also an element of many [[Japanese horror]] films and ''[[Pink film|pinku eiga]]'', particularly of the 1960s and 1970s. Examples include [[Teruo Ishii]]'s ''[[Shogun's Joys of Torture]]'' ([[1968 in film|1968]]) and ''[[Horrors of Malformed Men]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]) and [[Yasuzo Masumura]]'s ''[[Blind Beast]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]), the latter two based on the works of [[Edogawa Rampo]]. A more recent example of ero guro in cinema is [[Sion Sono]]'s ''[[Strange Circus]]'' ([[2005 in film|2005]]).

There are modern guro artists, some of whom cite Erotic Grotesque Nonsense as an influence on their work. These artists explore the macabre intermingled with sexual overtones. Often the erotic element, even when not explicit, is merged with grotesque themes and features similar to the works of [[H. R. Giger]]. Others produce ero guro as a genre of [[Japanese pornography]] and [[hentai]] involving [[blood]], [[Disembowelment|gore]], [[disfiguration]], [[violence]], [[Body integrity identity disorder|mutilation]], [[Urolagnia|urine]], [[Klismaphilia|enemas]], or [[Coprophilia|feces]].

Well-known guro [[Mangaka|manga artists]] include [[Suehiro Maruo]], [[Hajime Yamano]], [[Jun Hayami]], [[Go Nagai]], [[Shintaro Kago]], [[Toshio Maeda]], [[Henmaru Machino]], [[Yamamoto Takato]], [[Horihone Saizō]], and [[Waita Uziga]].

The modern genre of [[Tentacle erotica|tentacle rape]] began within the category of ero guro (although it has much older roots in Japanese art; see ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife|Octopi and shell diver]]'') but became so popular that it is now usually considered separately.

==In music==
Some [[visual kei]] bands have a concept or theme relating to ero guro, most notably [[Cali Gari]].&lt;ref name="bounce.com"&gt;[http://www.bounce.com/article/article.php/3419/2/ Bounce ''Di(s)ctionary Number 13—Visual Kei''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616173324/http://www.bounce.com/article/article.php/3419/2/ |date=June 16, 2008 }}. Retrieved November 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Western visual kei fans assumed their theme was a subgenre of visual kei and linked it with other similar bands.

The 2014 [[Flying Lotus]] album ''[[You're Dead!]]'' prominently featured ero guro artwork from Japanese manga artist [[Shintaro Kago]] on the cover and inner sleeve, with further art being utilised in the accompanying live show. Much of the drawings featured men and women being disfigured and mutilated in unrealistic, hi-tech ways with a significant amount of gore and nudity.

'''''Ethnic Cleansing''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] video game for [[Microsoft Windows]] computers, created by the American [[White supremacy|White supremacist]] organization [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]]  (and published by its record label [[Resistance Records]]) on January 21, 2002. As part of a "[[Race war|Race War]]", the player controls a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] skinhead or a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]] and is tasked with killing stereotypical [[African-American]], [[Mexican-American|Mexican]], and [[Jewish-American|Jewish]] enemies, ending with then-[[Israel]]i Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]].

Using the [[Genesis3D]] engine, the National Alliance created the game to be provocative and to support their white supremacist message. The game has been controversial, with the [[Anti-Defamation League]] taking particular issue; it has been ranked several times as one of the most controversial games ever created. It was planned to be followed by a long line of sequels, but only one, titled ''White Law'', has been released.

==Gameplay==
''Ethnic Cleansing'' is a standard, short-length [[first-person shooter]] set in a single [[Level (video gaming)|level]]. The player can select a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]], a [[White power skinhead|Skinhead]], or a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]] to control. They run through a [[ghetto]] that has been compared to [[New York City]] and shoot [[African-American]]s and [[Mexican American|Mexican]]s, before descending into a subway system to kill [[Jewish-Americans|Jews]]. Finally, the player reaches the "[[Zionist Occupied Government|Yiddish Control Center]]", where a fictionalized version of [[Ariel Sharon]], then [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] of [[Israel]], is directing plans for world domination.&lt;ref name="pop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ugo"/&gt; He carries a [[rocket launcher]]; the player must kill him to complete the game.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"/&gt; The [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up]] display contains a map of nearby enemies and a counter of remaining ammunition.&lt;ref name="game"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Ethnic Cleansing|publisher=[[Resistance Records]]|developer=[[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]]|date=January 21, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's soundtrack consists of [[White power music#White power rock|white power rock music]]. The game's art assets and sound effects feature [[ethnic stereotype|racial stereotypes]]: when shot, black enemies make monkey noises and Jewish enemies are dressed as [[rabbi]]s and shout "[[oy vey]]!".&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; Mexican characters shout "I need to take a siesta now". In addition, black enemies are drawn to resemble apes&lt;ref name="stuff"/&gt; and some wear T-shirts with the lettering "[[Nigga|NIGZ]]",&lt;ref name="ugo"/&gt; while Mexican enemies wear [[sombrero]]s.&lt;ref name="stuff"/&gt;

''Ethnic Cleansing'' was developed by members of the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], an American [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] organization, and published by [[Resistance Records]], its subsidiary record label that specializes in [[white power music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/476/f3d/719/united-states-v-ross|publisher=OpenJurist|title=476 F. 3d 719 - United States v. Ross|date=February 8, 2007|accessdate=October 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813085004/http://openjurist.org/476/f3d/719/united-states-v-ross|archive-date=2014-08-13|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed for [[Microsoft Windows]] personal computers using Eclipse Entertainment's [[open-source software|open-source]] game engine [[Genesis3D]] along with the Reality Factory development kit. The source code was not substantially changed from the original. Instead, the developers simply plugged in images and sounds that they had created in freely available editing programs.&lt;ref name="promote hate"/&gt;

Shaun Walker, the chairman of the National Alliance, explained to the [[United Press]] that the intent was to produce a racially provocative video game and promote [[racial segregation]].&lt;ref name="eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Ellie|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news180705racists|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|title=Racists launch PC game|date=July 18, 2005|accessdate=October 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026055233/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news180705racists|archive-date=2014-10-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Alliance founder [[William Luther Pierce]], who also appears in the game to discuss an "upcoming [[European Americans|white]] revolution", considered video games to be simply another medium to promote his organization's messages. Resistance released the game on [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]] (January 21) of 2002.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="promote hate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/assets/pdf/combating-hate/Racist-groups-use-computer-gaming.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|title=Racist Groups Use Computer Gaming to Promote Hate|accessdate=October 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105220545/http://www.adl.org/assets/pdf/combating-hate/Racist-groups-use-computer-gaming.pdf|archive-date=2013-11-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was priced at [[U.S. dollar|USD $]]14.88,&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; a reference to the white supremacist [[Fourteen Words]] slogan and the neo-Nazi numerical code "88" (which stands for "HH" or "Heil Hitler").

==Reception and controversy==
[[File:Ethnic Cleansing shot.png|thumb|left|275px|Here, the player shoots two African-American men. The game received backlash for its racist themes.]]
While it received little attention from the mainstream media, the game was immediately controversial among Americans on both sides of the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208065556/http://www.popmatters.com/multimedia/features/040226-whitesupremacists.shtml|url=http://www.popmatters.com/multimedia/features/040226-whitesupremacists.shtml|last=Leonard|first=David|title=White Supremacist Games or Just More of the Same?|date=February 26, 2004|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|archivedate=December 8, 2009|accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]], an [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] organization that especially covers [[anti-Semitism]], publicized the existence of the game and unsuccessfully lobbied the developers of Genesis3D to change their licensing conditions to prohibit the use of the engine to develop racist games. They lobbied the [[Interactive Digital Software Association]] to encourage its members to adopt such policies.&lt;ref name="promote hate"/&gt;

The game's reception from critics was extremely negative. David Leonard of [[PopMatters]] described the game's graphics and "playability". While not approving of the game's message, he argued that it was only the latest in a long line of racist video games that included the likes of ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'', ''[[NFL Street]]'', and ''[[Freedom Fighters (video game)|Freedom Fighters]]''.&lt;ref name="pop"/&gt; In January 2003, ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]'' named ''Ethnic Cleansing'' the 40th most controversial video game of all time. The staff opined that only "very stupid children" would be susceptible to its message and that it would make players feel like "small-minded assholes".&lt;ref name="stuff"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/8043349/50-Most-Controversial-Games-Ever-Stuff-Magazine-200X|title=50 Most Controversial Games Ever|journal=[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]|date=January 2003|page=75|access-date=2017-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305160325/https://www.scribd.com/doc/8043349/50-Most-Controversial-Games-Ever-Stuff-Magazine-200X|archive-date=2016-03-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]''&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/06/the-10-most-racist-video-games/|publisher=''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]''|title=The 10 Most Racist Video Games|accessdate=October 21, 2014|last=Hester|first=Larry|date=June 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021100656/http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/06/the-10-most-racist-video-games/|archive-date=2014-10-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[UGO]]'' ranked it as the single most racist video game in history. ''UGO'' staff writer K. Thor Jensen called it "profoundly stupid".&lt;ref name="ugo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/ethnic-cleansing|publisher=[[UGO]]|last=Jensen|first=K. Thor|title=The 11 Most Racist Video Games|date=November 30, 2010|accessdate=October 21, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128214108/http://www.ugo.com/games/ethnic-cleansing|archivedate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierce estimated that "a couple thousand" copies of the game had been sold within a month of its release and that 90 percent of consumers had been white teenage boys.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;

==Sequel==
The National Alliance and Resistance Records released a similar game, ''White Law'', in June 2003. It starred an [[Irish-American]] police officer taking up arms to protect his territory from racial minorities. It has been compared to [[Freedom Fighters (video game)|''Freedom Fighters'']],&lt;ref name="pop"/&gt; though it was based on the events of Pierce's novel ''[[The Turner Diaries]]''. The National Alliance intended to create an entire line of racist games, but no more have surfaced.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/02/50523|last=Scheeres|first=Julia|title=Games Elevate Hate to Next Level|date=February 20, 2002|accessdate=October 21, 2014|publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929044711/http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/02/50523|archive-date=2014-09-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/presrele/internet_75/4042_72.html#.VEX9gvldWSo|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|date=February 19, 2002|title=ADL Report: Growing Proliferation of Racist Video Games Target Youth on The Internet|accessdate=October 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817194717/http://archive.adl.org/presrele/internet_75/4042_72.html#.VEX9gvldWSo|archive-date=2014-08-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SUB REACTOR SYSTEM FLOW.jpg|thumb|280px|Example of a flow diagram of a nuclear submarine propulsion system.]]

'''Flow diagram''' is a collective term for a [[diagram]] representing a flow or set of dynamic relationships in a system. The term flow diagram is also used as a synonym for [[flowchart]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Harris. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qusmDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22flow%20diagram%22&amp;f=false Information Graphics: A Comprehensive Illustrated Reference].'' 2000. p. 153-155&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes as a counterpart of the flowchart.&lt;ref name="Ha 1999 156"&gt;Harris. (1999, p. 156)&lt;/ref&gt;     

Flow diagrams are used to structure and order a [[complex system]], or to reveal the underlying structure of the elements and their interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Urs B. Meyer et al. ''Process Oriented Analysis: Design and Optimization of Industrial Production Systems.'' 2006. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Overview ==
The term flow diagram is used in theory and practice in different meanings. Most commonly the flow chart and flow diagram are used in an interchangeable way in the meaning of a representation of a process. For example the ''Information Graphics: A Comprehensive Illustrated Reference'' by Harris (1999) gives two separate definitions: 
:'''''Flow chart or flow diagram'''... is a diagram that visually displays interrelated information such as events, steps in a process, functions, etc., in an organized fashion, such as sequentially or chronologically.''&lt;ref&gt;Harris. (1999, p. 153)&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''''Flow diagram''' [is] a graphic representation of the physical route or flow of people, materials, paperworks, vehicles, or communication associated with a process, procedure plan, or investigation.''&lt;ref name="Ha 1999 156"&gt;Harris. (1999, p. 156)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second definition the meaning is limited to the representation of the physical route or flow. An example of such a diagram is the illustration of the flows in a nuclear [[submarine]] [[propulsion system]], which shows different streams back and forth in the system. The representation of such a system can be supplemented by one or more flowcharts, which show the sequence of one of the flows in one direction, or any of the control flows to manage the system.  

The physical movement of objects from one location to another can also be visualized in a mix of maps and flowchart or [[sankey diagram]], which are called [[flow map]]s. Flow maps can indicate on a [[map]], what flows, moves or migrates, in which direction, and in which quantities etc.&lt;ref&gt;Harris. (1999, p. 157)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific types of flow diagrams ==
[[File:Sankey Diagram of US Consumer Expenditure in 2012.jpg|thumb|Sankey Diagram of US Consumer Expenditure in 2012]]
In theory and practice specific types of diagrams are also called a type of flow diagrams, such as:
* [[Alluvial diagram]], highlights and summarizes the significant structural changes in networks
* [[Circular flow of income]]
* [[Control flow diagram]], a diagram to describe the control flow of a business process, process or program
* [[Cumulative flow diagram]], a tool used in queuing theory.
* [[Functional flow block diagram]], in systems engineering
* [[Data flow diagram]], a graphical representation of the flow of data through an information system
* [[Stock_and_flow#Example_of_dynamic_stock_and_flow_diagram|Dynamic stock and flow diagram]]
* [[Information flow diagram]], an illustration of information flow throughout an organisation.
* [[Process flow diagram]], in Operations, a graphical representation of a process
* [[Product flow diagram]] (PFD), a graphical representation of the order by which a sequence of products is created according to Product based planning principles.
* A form of [[Rapping#Rap notation and flow diagrams|rap notation]] known as "flow diagram".
* [[Sankey diagram]], where line width represents magnitude
* [[Signal-flow graph]], in mathematics, a graphical means of showing the relations among the variables of a set of linear algebraic relations
* [[State diagram]], a representation of a finite state machine

{{spacetime|cTopic=Mathematics}}
In [[special relativity]], a '''four-vector''' (also known as a 4-vector)&lt;ref&gt;Rindler, W. ''Introduction to Special Relativity (2nd edn.)'' (1991) Clarendon Press Oxford {{ISBN|0-19-853952-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an object with four components, which transform in a specific way under [[Lorentz transformation]]. Specifically, a four-vector is an element of a four-dimensional [[vector space]] considered as a [[representation space]] of the [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|standard representation]] of the [[Lorentz group]], the (½,½) representation. It differs from a [[Euclidean vector]] in how its magnitude is determined. The transformations that preserve this magnitude are the Lorentz transformations, which include [[Rotation group SO(3)|spatial rotations]] and [[Lorentz transformation#Boost in the x-direction|boosts]] (a change by a constant velocity to another [[inertial reference frame]]).&lt;ref name="BaskalKim2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sibel Baskal|author2=Young S Kim|author3=Marilyn E Noz|title=Physics of the Lorentz Group|date=1 November 2015|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers|isbn=978-1-68174-062-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ch1}}

Four-vectors describe, for instance, position {{math|''x''{{i sup|''μ''}}}} in spacetime modeled as [[Minkowski space]], a particle's [[four-momentum]] {{math|''p''{{i sup|''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, the amplitude of the [[electromagnetic four-potential]] {{math|''A''{{i sup|''μ''}}(''x'')}} at a point {{mvar|x}} in spacetime, and the elements of the subspace spanned by the [[gamma matrices]] inside the [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#Induced representations|Dirac algebra]].

The Lorentz group may be represented by 4×4 matrices {{math|Λ}}. The action of a Lorentz transformation on a general [[contravariant vector|contravariant]] four-vector {{mvar|X}} (like the examples above), regarded as a column vector with [[Cartesian coordinates]] with respect to an [[Inertial frame#Special relativity|inertial frame]] in the entries, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;X^\prime = \Lambda X,&lt;/math&gt;

(matrix multiplication) where the components of the primed object refer to the new frame. Related to the examples above that are given as contravariant vectors, there are also the corresponding [[covariant vector]]s {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}}. These transform according to the rule

:&lt;math&gt;X^\prime = {(\Lambda^{-1})}^\mathrm T X,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}} denotes the [[matrix transpose]]. This rule is different from the above rule. It corresponds to the [[dual representation]] of the standard representation. However, for the Lorentz group the dual of any representation is [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#Dual representations|equivalent]] to the original representation. Thus the objects with covariant indices are four-vectors as well.

For an example of a well-behaved four-component object in special relativity that is ''not'' a four-vector, see [[bispinor]]. It is similarly defined, the difference being that the transformation rule under Lorentz transformations is given by a representation other than the standard representation. In this case, the rule reads {{math|''X''{{′}} {{=}} Π(Λ)''X''}}, where {{math|Π(Λ)}} is a 4×4 matrix other than {{math|Λ}}. Similar remarks apply to objects with fewer or more components that are well-behaved under Lorentz transformations. These include [[scalar field|scalar]]s, [[spinor]]s, [[tensors]] and spinor-tensors.

The article considers four-vectors in the context of special relativity. Although the concept of four-vectors also extends to [[general relativity]], some of the results stated in this article require modification in general relativity. &lt;!-- TO DO: provide a GR section for this article! --&gt;

== Notation ==

The notations in this article are: lowercase bold for [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] vectors, hats for three-dimensional [[unit vector]]s, capital bold for [[Spacetime|four dimensional]] vectors (except for the four-gradient), and [[tensor index notation]].

== Four-vector algebra ==

===Four-vectors in a real-valued basis===

A '''four-vector''' ''A'' is a vector with a "timelike" component and three "spacelike" components, and can be written in various equivalent notations:&lt;ref&gt;Relativity DeMystified, D. McMahon, Mc Graw Hill (BSA), 2006, {{ISBN|0-07-145545-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\mathbf{A} &amp; = (A^0, \, A^1, \, A^2, \, A^3) \\
&amp; = A^0\mathbf{E}_0 + A^1 \mathbf{E}_1 + A^2 \mathbf{E}_2 + A^3  \mathbf{E}_3 \\
&amp; = A^0\mathbf{E}_0 + A^i \mathbf{E}_i \\
&amp; = A^\alpha\mathbf{E}_\alpha\\
&amp; = A^\mu  
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where in the last form the magnitude component and [[basis vector]] have been combined to a single element.

The upper indices indicate [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] components. Here the standard convention is that Latin indices take values for spatial components, so that ''i'' = 1, 2, 3, and Greek indices take values for space ''and time'' components, so ''α'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, used with the [[summation convention]]. The split between the time component and the spatial components is a useful one to make when determining contractions of one four vector with other tensor quantities, such as for calculating Lorentz invariants in inner products (examples are given below), or [[raising and lowering indices]].

In special relativity, the spacelike basis '''E'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''E'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''E'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and components ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''A''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are often [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian]] basis and components:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\mathbf{A} &amp; = (A_t, \, A_x, \, A_y, \, A_z) \\
&amp; = A_t \mathbf{E}_t + A_x \mathbf{E}_x + A_y \mathbf{E}_y + A_z  \mathbf{E}_z \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

although, of course, any other basis and components may be used, such as [[spherical polar coordinates]]

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\mathbf{A} &amp; = (A_t, \, A_r, \, A_\theta, \, A_\phi) \\
&amp; = A_t \mathbf{E}_t + A_r \mathbf{E}_r + A_\theta \mathbf{E}_\theta + A_\phi \mathbf{E}_\phi \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or [[cylindrical polar coordinates]],

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\mathbf{A} &amp; = (A_t, \, A_r, \, A_\theta, \, A_z) \\
&amp; = A_t \mathbf{E}_t + A_r \mathbf{E}_r + A_\theta \mathbf{E}_\theta + A_z \mathbf{E}_z \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or any other [[orthogonal coordinates]], or even general [[curvilinear coordinates]]. Note the coordinate labels are always subscripted as labels and are not indices taking numerical values. In general relativity, local curvilinear coordinates in a local basis must be used. Geometrically, a four-vector can still be interpreted as an arrow, but in spacetime - not just space. In relativity, the arrows are drawn as part of  [[Minkowski diagram]] (also called ''spacetime diagram''). In this article, four-vectors will be referred to simply as vectors.

It is also customary to represent the bases by [[column vector]]s:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{E}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{E}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{E}_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

so that:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} A^0 \\ A^1 \\ A^2 \\ A^3 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

The relation between the [[covariant vector|covariant]] and contravariant coordinates is through the [[Minkowski metric|Minkowski]] [[metric tensor]] (referred to as the metric), ''η'' which [[raising and lowering indices|raises and lowers indices]] as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\mu} =  \eta_{\mu \nu} A^{\nu} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and in various equivalent notations the covariant components are:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\mathbf{A} &amp; = (A_0, \, A_1, \, A_2, \, A_3) \\
&amp; = A_0\mathbf{E}^0 + A_1 \mathbf{E}^1 + A_2 \mathbf{E}^2 + A_3  \mathbf{E}^3 \\
&amp; = A_0\mathbf{E}^0 + A_i \mathbf{E}^i \\
&amp; = A_\alpha\mathbf{E}^\alpha\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the lowered index indicates it to be [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]]. Often the metric is diagonal, as is the case for [[orthogonal coordinates]] (see [[line element]]), but not in general [[curvilinear coordinates]].

The bases can be represented by [[row vector]]s:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}^0 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{E}^1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{E}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{E}^3 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

so that:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} A_0 &amp; A_1 &amp; A_2 &amp; A_3 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

The motivation for the above conventions are that the inner product is a scalar, see below for details.

=== Lorentz transformation ===

{{main|Lorentz transformation}}

Given two inertial or rotated [[frame of reference|frames of reference]], a four-vector is defined as a quantity which transforms according to the [[Lorentz transformation]] matrix&amp;nbsp;'''Λ''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}'=\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

In index notation, the contravariant and covariant components transform according to, respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;{A'}^\mu = \Lambda^\mu {}_\nu A^\nu \,, \quad{A'}_\mu =  \Lambda_\mu {}^\nu A_\nu&lt;/math&gt;

in which the matrix '''Λ''' has components Λ''&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'' in row&amp;nbsp;''μ'' and column&amp;nbsp;''ν'', and the [[inverse matrix]] '''Λ'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; has components Λ''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ν&lt;/sup&gt;'' in row&amp;nbsp;''μ'' and column&amp;nbsp;''ν''.

For background on the nature of this transformation definition, see [[tensor#Definition|tensor]]. All four-vectors transform in the same way, and this can be generalized to four-dimensional relativistic tensors; see [[Special relativity#Transformations of physical quantities between reference frames|special relativity]].

====Pure rotations about an arbitrary axis ====

For two frames rotated by a fixed angle ''θ'' about an axis defined by the [[unit vector]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}} = (\hat{n}_1,\hat{n}_2,\hat{n}_3)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

without any boosts, the matrix '''Λ''' has components given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=C.B. Parker| title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics| publisher=McGraw Hill|edition=2nd|page=1333|year=1994| isbn=0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{00} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda_{0i} = \Lambda_{i0} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{ij} = (\delta_{ij} - \hat{n}_i \hat{n}_j) \cos\theta - \varepsilon_{ijk} \hat{n}_k \sin\theta  + \hat{n}_i \hat{n}_j &lt;/math&gt;

where ''δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Kronecker delta]], and ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[three-dimensional]] [[Levi-Civita symbol]]. The spacelike components of four-vectors are rotated, while the timelike components remain unchanged.

For the case of rotations about the ''z''-axis only, the spacelike part of the Lorentz matrix reduces to the [[rotation matrix]] about the ''z''-axis:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
{A'}^0 \\ {A'}^1 \\ {A'}^2 \\ {A'}^3
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cos\theta &amp;-\sin\theta &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \sin\theta &amp; \cos\theta &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
A^0 \\ A^1 \\ A^2 \\ A^3
\end{pmatrix}\ .
&lt;/math&gt;

====Pure boosts in an arbitrary direction====

[[File:Standard conf.png|right|thumb|300px|Standard configuration of coordinate systems; for a Lorentz boost in the ''x''-direction.]]

For two frames moving at constant relative three-velocity '''v''' (not four-velocity, [[#Four-velocity|see below]]), it is convenient to denote and define the relative velocity in units of ''c'' by:

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\beta} = (\beta_1,\,\beta_2,\,\beta_3) = \frac{1}{c}(v_1,\,v_2,\,v_3) = \frac{1}{c}\mathbf{v} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Then without rotations, the matrix '''Λ''' has components given by:&lt;ref&gt;Gravitation, J.B. Wheeler, C. Misner, K.S. Thorne, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co, 1973, ISAN 0-7167-0344-0&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \Lambda_{00} &amp; = \gamma, \\
\Lambda_{0i} &amp; = \Lambda_{i0} = - \gamma \beta_{i}, \\
\Lambda_{ij} &amp; = \Lambda_{ji} = ( \gamma - 1 )\dfrac{\beta_{i}\beta_{j}}{\beta^{2}} + \delta_{ij}= ( \gamma - 1 )\dfrac{v_i v_j}{v^2} + \delta_{ij}, \\
\end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Lorentz factor]] is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1- \boldsymbol{\beta}\cdot\boldsymbol{\beta}}} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and ''δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Kronecker delta]]. Contrary to the case for pure rotations, the spacelike and timelike components are mixed together under boosts.

For the case of a boost in the ''x''-direction only, the matrix reduces to;&lt;ref&gt;Dynamics and Relativity, J.R. Forshaw, B.G. Smith, Wiley, 2009, ISAN 978-0-470-01460-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Relativity DeMystified, D. McMahon, Mc Graw Hill (ASB), 2006, ISAN 0-07-145545-0&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
A'^0 \\ A'^1 \\ A'^2 \\ A'^3
\end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix}
\cosh\phi &amp;-\sinh\phi &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
-\sinh\phi  &amp; \cosh\phi &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
A^0 \\ A^1 \\ A^2 \\ A^3
\end{pmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Where the [[rapidity]] ''ϕ'' expression has been used, written in terms of the [[hyperbolic function]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma = \cosh \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

This Lorentz matrix illustrates the boost to be a ''[[hyperbolic rotation]]'' in four dimensional spacetime, analogous to the circular rotation above in three-dimensional space.

===Properties===

====Linearity====

Four-vectors have the same [[Linear algebra|linearity properties]] as [[Euclidean vector]]s in [[three dimensions]]. They can be added in the usual entrywise way:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B} = (A^0, A^1, A^2,A^3) + (B^0, B^1, B^2,B^3) = (A^0 + B^0, A^1 + B^1, A^2 + B^2, A^3 + B^3)  &lt;/math&gt;

and similarly [[scalar multiplication]] by a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] ''λ'' is defined entrywise by:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda\mathbf{A} = \lambda(A^0, A^1, A^2,A^3) = (\lambda A^0, \lambda A^1, \lambda A^2, \lambda A^3) &lt;/math&gt;

Then subtraction is the inverse operation of addition, defined entrywise by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}+(-1)\mathbf{B} = (A^0, A^1, A^2,A^3) + (-1)(B^0, B^1, B^2,B^3) = (A^0 - B^0, A^1 - B^1, A^2 - B^2, A^3 - B^3)  &lt;/math&gt;

====Minkowski tensor====

{{See also|spacetime interval}}

Applying the [[Minkowski tensor]] ''η&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;'' to two four-vectors '''A''' and '''B''', writing the result in [[dot product]] notation, we have, using [[Einstein notation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = A^{\mu} \eta_{\mu \nu} B^{\nu} &lt;/math&gt;

It is convenient to rewrite the definition in [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot B} = \begin{pmatrix} A^0 &amp; A^1 &amp; A^2 &amp; A^3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \eta_{00} &amp; \eta_{01} &amp; \eta_{02} &amp; \eta_{03} \\ \eta_{10} &amp; \eta_{11} &amp; \eta_{12} &amp; \eta_{13} \\ \eta_{20} &amp; \eta_{21} &amp; \eta_{22} &amp; \eta_{23} \\ \eta_{30} &amp; \eta_{31} &amp; \eta_{32} &amp; \eta_{33} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} B^0 \\ B^1 \\ B^2 \\ B^3 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

in which case ''η&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;'' above is the entry in row ''μ'' and column ''ν'' of the Minkowski metric as a square matrix. The Minkowski metric is not a [[Euclidean metric]], because it is indefinite (see [[metric signature]]). A number of other expressions can be used because the metric tensor can raise and lower the components of '''A''' or '''B'''. For contra/co-variant components of '''A''' and co/contra-variant components of '''B''', we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = A^{\mu} \eta_{\mu \nu} B^{\nu} = A_{\nu} B^{\nu} = A^{\mu} B_{\mu} &lt;/math&gt;

so in the matrix notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot B} = \begin{pmatrix} A_0 &amp; A_1 &amp; A_2 &amp; A_3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} B^0 \\ B^1 \\ B^2 \\ B^3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} B_0 &amp; B_1 &amp; B_2 &amp; B_3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A^0 \\ A^1 \\ A^2 \\ A^3 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

while for '''A''' and '''B''' each in covariant components:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = A_{\mu} \eta^{\mu \nu} B_{\nu} &lt;/math&gt;

with a similar matrix expression to the above.

Applying the Minkowski tensor to a four-vector '''A''' with itself we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot A} = A^\mu \eta_{\mu\nu} A^\nu &lt;/math&gt;

which, depending on the case, may be considered the square, or its negative, of the length of the vector.

Following are two common choices for the metric tensor in the [[Minkowski space#Standard basis|standard basis]] (essentially Cartesian coordinates). If orthogonal coordinates are used, there would be scale factors along the diagonal part of the spacelike part of the metric, while for general curvilinear coordinates the entire spacelike part of the metric would have components dependent on the curvilinear basis used.

=====Standard basis, (+−−−) signature=====

In the (+−−−) [[metric signature]], evaluating the [[Einstein notation|summation over indices]] gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} =  A^0 B^0 - A^1 B^1 - A^2 B^2 - A^3 B^3  &lt;/math&gt;

while in matrix form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot B} = \begin{pmatrix} A^0 &amp; A^1 &amp; A^2 &amp; A^3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} B^0 \\ B^1 \\ B^2 \\ B^3 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

It is a recurring theme in special relativity to take the expression

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{B} = A^0 B^0 - A^1 B^1 - A^2 B^2 - A^3 B^3 = C&lt;/math&gt;

in one [[Frame of reference|reference frame]], where ''C'' is the value of the inner product in this frame, and:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}'\cdot\mathbf{B}' = {A'}^0 {B'}^0 - {A'}^1 {B'}^1 - {A'}^2 {B'}^2 - {A'}^3 {B'}^3 = C' &lt;/math&gt;

in another frame, in which ''C''&amp;prime; is the value of the inner product in this frame. Then since the inner product is an invariant, these must be equal:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{A}'\cdot\mathbf{B}' &lt;/math&gt;

that is:

:&lt;math&gt; C = A^0 B^0 - A^1 B^1 - A^2 B^2 - A^3 B^3 = {A'}^0 {B'}^0 - {A'}^1 {B'}^1 - {A'}^2 {B'}^2 - {A'}^3{B'}^3 &lt;/math&gt;

Considering that physical quantities in relativity are four-vectors, this equation has the appearance of a "[[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]", but there is no "conservation" involved. The primary significance of the Minkowski inner product is that for any two four-vectors, its value is [[invariant (physics)|invariant]] for all observers; a change of coordinates does not result in a change in value of the inner product. The components of the four-vectors change from one frame to another; '''A''' and '''A'''&amp;prime; are connected by a [[Lorentz transformation]], and similarly for '''B''' and '''B'''&amp;prime;, although the inner products are the same in all frames. Nevertheless, this type of expression is exploited in relativistic calculations on a par with conservation laws, since the magnitudes of components can be determined without explicitly performing any Lorentz transformations. A particular example is with energy and momentum in the [[energy-momentum relation]] derived from the [[four-momentum]] vector (see also below).

In this signature we have:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A \cdot A} = (A^0)^2 - (A^1)^2 - (A^2)^2 - (A^3)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

With the signature (+−−−), four-vectors may be classified as either [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|spacelike]] if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot A} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|timelike]] if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot A} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, and [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|null vector]]s if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot A} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=====Standard basis, (−+++) signature=====

Some authors define ''η'' with the opposite sign, in which case we have the (−+++) metric signature. Evaluating the summation with this signature:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot B} = - A^0 B^0 + A^1 B^1 + A^2 B^2 + A^3 B^3 &lt;/math&gt;

while the matrix form is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot B} = \left( \begin{matrix}A^0 &amp; A^1 &amp; A^2 &amp; A^3 \end{matrix} \right) 
\left( \begin{matrix} -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}B^0 \\ B^1 \\ B^2 \\ B^3 \end{matrix} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in this case, in one frame:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{B} = - A^0 B^0 + A^1 B^1 + A^2 B^2 + A^3 B^3 = -C &lt;/math&gt;

while in another:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}'\cdot\mathbf{B}' = - {A'}^0 {B'}^0 + {A'}^1 {B'}^1 + {A'}^2 {B'}^2 + {A'}^3 {B'}^3 = -C'&lt;/math&gt;

so that:

:&lt;math&gt; -C = - A^0 B^0 + A^1 B^1 + A^2 B^2 + A^3 B^3 = - {A'}^0 {B'}^0 + {A'}^1 {B'}^1 + {A'}^2 {B'}^2 + {A'}^3{B'}^3&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to the above expression for ''C'' in terms of '''A''' and '''B'''. Either convention will work. With the Minkowski metric defined in the two ways above, the only difference between covariant and contravariant four-vector components are signs, therefore the signs depend on which sign convention is used.

We have:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A \cdot A} = - (A^0)^2 + (A^1)^2 + (A^2)^2 + (A^3)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

With the signature (−+++), four-vectors may be classified as either [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|spacelike]] if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot A} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|timelike]] if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot A} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, and [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|null]] if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot A} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=====Dual vectors=====

Applying the Minkowski tensor is often expressed as the effect of the [[dual space#Ailinear products and dual spaces|dual vector]] of one vector on the other:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot B} = A^*(\mathbf{B}) = A{_\nu}B^{\nu}. &lt;/math&gt;

Here the ''A&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''s are the components of the dual vector '''A'''* of '''A''' in the [[dual basis]] and called the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] coordinates of '''A''', while the original ''A&lt;sup&gt;ν&lt;/sup&gt;'' components are called the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] coordinates.

== Four-vector calculus ==

===Derivatives and differentials===

In special relativity (but not general relativity), the [[derivative]] of a four-vector with respect to a scalar ''λ'' (invariant) is itself a four-vector. It is also useful to take the [[differential of a function|differential]] of the four-vector, ''d'''''A''' and divide it by the differential of the scalar, ''dλ'':

:&lt;math&gt;\underset{\text{differential}}{d\mathbf{A}} = \underset{\text{derivative}}{\frac{d\mathbf{A}}{d\lambda}} \underset{\text{differential}}{d\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;

where the contravariant components are:

:&lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{A} = (dA^0, dA^1, dA^2, dA^3) &lt;/math&gt;

while the covariant components are:

:&lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{A} = (dA_0, dA_1, dA_2, dA_3) &lt;/math&gt;

In relativistic mechanics, one often takes the differential of a four-vector and divides by the differential in [[proper time]] (see below).

==Fundamental four-vectors==

===Four-position===

A point in [[Minkowski space]] is a time and spatial position, called an "event", or sometimes the position four-vector or four-position or 4-position, described in some reference frame by a set of four coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}= \left(ct, \mathbf{r}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where '''r''' is the [[three-dimensional space]] [[position vector]]. If '''r''' is a function of coordinate time ''t'' in the same frame, i.e. '''r''' = '''r'''(''t''), this corresponds to a sequence of events as ''t'' varies. The definition ''R''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ct'' ensures that all the coordinates have the same units (of distance).&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Bernard Zuber &amp; Claude Itzykson, ''Quantum Field Theory'', pg 5 , {{ISBN|0-07-032071-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles W. Misner]], [[Kip S. Thorne]] &amp; [[John A. Wheeler]],''Gravitation'', pg 51, {{ISBN|0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Sterman]], ''An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory'', pg 4 , {{ISBN|0-521-31132-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These coordinates are the components of the ''position four-vector'' for the event.
The ''displacement four-vector'' is defined to be an "arrow" linking two events:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \mathbf{R} = \left(c\Delta t, \Delta \mathbf{r} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

For the [[differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] four-position on a world line we have, using [[Minkowski space#Minkowski tensor|a norm notation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\|d\mathbf{R}\|^2 = \mathbf{dR \cdot dR} = dR^\mu dR_\mu=c^2d\tau^2=ds^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

defining the differential [[line element]] d''s'' and differential proper time increment d''τ'', but this "norm" is also:

:&lt;math&gt;\|d\mathbf{R}\|^2 = (cdt)^2 - d\mathbf{r}\cdot d\mathbf{r} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

so that:

:&lt;math&gt; (c d\tau)^2 = (cdt)^2 - d\mathbf{r}\cdot d\mathbf{r} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

When considering physical phenomena, differential equations arise naturally; however, when considering space and [[time derivative]]s of functions, it is unclear which reference frame these derivatives are taken with respect to. It is agreed that time derivatives are taken with respect to the [[proper time]] &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. As proper time is an invariant, this guarantees that the proper-time-derivative of any four-vector is itself a four-vector. It is then important to find a relation between this proper-time-derivative and another time derivative (using the [[coordinate time]] ''t'' of an inertial reference frame). This relation is provided by taking the above differential invariant spacetime interval, then dividing by (''cdt'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to obtain:

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{cd\tau}{cdt}\right)^2 = 1 - \left(\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{cdt}\cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{cdt}\right) = 1 - \frac{\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{u}}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma(\mathbf{u})^2} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where '''u''' = ''d'''''r'''/''dt'' is the coordinate 3-[[velocity]] of an object measured in the same frame as the coordinates ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and [[coordinate time]] ''t'', and

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma(\mathbf{u}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1- \frac{\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{u}}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Lorentz factor]]. This provides a useful relation between the differentials in coordinate time and proper time:

:&lt;math&gt; dt = \gamma(\mathbf{u})d\tau \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This relation can also be found from the time transformation in the [[Lorentz transformation]]s.

Important four-vectors in relativity theory can be defined by applying this differential &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\tau}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Four-gradient===

Considering that [[partial derivative]]s are [[linear operator]]s, one can form a [[four-gradient]] from the partial [[time derivative]] {{math|∂}}/{{math|∂}}''t'' and the spatial [[gradient]] ∇. Using the standard basis, in index and abbreviated notations, the contravariant components are:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\boldsymbol{\partial} &amp; = \left(\frac{\partial }{\partial x_0}, \, -\frac{\partial }{\partial x_1}, \, -\frac{\partial }{\partial x_2}, \, -\frac{\partial }{\partial x_3} \right) \\
&amp; = (\partial^0, \, - \partial^1, \, - \partial^2, \, - \partial^3) \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}_0\partial^0 - \mathbf{E}_1\partial^1 - \mathbf{E}_2\partial^2 - \mathbf{E}_3\partial^3 \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}_0\partial^0 - \mathbf{E}_i\partial^i \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}_\alpha \partial^\alpha \\
&amp; = \left(\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t} , \, - \nabla \right) \\
&amp; = \left(\frac{\partial_t}{c},- \nabla \right) \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}_0\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t} - \nabla \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note the basis vectors are placed in front of the components, to prevent confusion between taking the derivative of the basis vector, or simply indicating the partial derivative is a component of this four-vector. The covariant components are:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\partial} &amp; = \left(\frac{\partial }{\partial x^0}, \, \frac{\partial }{\partial x^1}, \, \frac{\partial }{\partial x^2}, \, \frac{\partial }{\partial x^3} \right) \\
&amp; = (\partial_0, \, \partial_1, \, \partial_2, \, \partial_3) \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}^0\partial_0 + \mathbf{E}^1\partial_1 + \mathbf{E}^2\partial_2 + \mathbf{E}^3\partial_3 \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}^0\partial_0 + \mathbf{E}^i\partial_i \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}^\alpha \partial_\alpha \\
&amp; = \left(\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t} , \, \nabla \right) \\
&amp; = \left(\frac{\partial_t}{c}, \nabla \right) \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}^0\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \nabla \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since this is an operator, it doesn't have a "length", but evaluating the inner product of the operator with itself gives another operator:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial^\mu \partial_\mu = \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 = \frac{{\partial_t}^2}{c^2} - \nabla^2&lt;/math&gt;

called the [[D'Alembert operator]].

==Kinematics==

=== Four-velocity ===

The [[four-velocity]] of a particle is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} = \frac{d\mathbf{X}}{d \tau}= \frac{d\mathbf{X}}{dt}\frac{dt}{d \tau} = \gamma(\mathbf{u})\left(c, \mathbf{u} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

Geometrically, '''U''' is a normalized vector tangent to the [[world line]] of the particle. Using the differential of the four-position, the magnitude of the four-velocity can be obtained:

:&lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{U}\|^2 = U^\mu U_\mu = \frac{dX^\mu }{d\tau} \frac{dX_\mu }{d\tau}= \frac{dX^\mu dX_\mu }{d\tau^2} = c^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

in short, the magnitude of the four-velocity for any object is always a fixed constant:

:&lt;math&gt; \| \mathbf{U} \|^2 = c^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

The norm is also:

:&lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{U}\|^2 = {\gamma(\mathbf{u})}^2 \left( c^2 - \mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{u} \right) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

so that:

:&lt;math&gt; c^2 = {\gamma(\mathbf{u})}^2 \left( c^2 - \mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{u} \right) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which reduces to the definition of the [[Lorentz factor]].

=== Four-acceleration ===

The [[four-acceleration]] is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} =\frac{d\mathbf{U} }{d \tau} = \gamma(\mathbf{u}) \left(\frac{d{\gamma}(\mathbf{u})}{dt} c, \frac{d{\gamma}(\mathbf{u})}{dt} \mathbf{u} + \gamma(\mathbf{u}) \mathbf{a} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

where '''a''' = ''d'''''u'''/''dt'' is the coordinate 3-acceleration. Since the magnitude of '''U''' is a constant, the four acceleration is orthogonal to the four velocity, i.e. the Minkowski inner product of the four-acceleration and the four-velocity is zero:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{U} = A^\mu  U_\mu  = \frac{dU^\mu}{d\tau} U_\mu = \frac{1}{2} \, \frac{d}{d\tau} (U^\mu U_\mu) = 0  \,&lt;/math&gt;

which is true for all world lines. The geometric meaning of four-acceleration is the [[curvature vector]] of the world line in Minkowski space.

==Dynamics==

=== Four-momentum ===

For a massive particle of [[rest mass]] (or [[invariant mass]]) ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[four-momentum]] is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = m_0 \mathbf{U} = m_0\gamma(\mathbf{u})(c,  \mathbf{u}) = (E/c, \mathbf{p}) &lt;/math&gt;

where the total energy of the moving particle is:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \gamma(\mathbf{u}) m_0c^2  &lt;/math&gt;

and the total [[relativistic momentum]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \gamma(\mathbf{u}) m_0 \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;

Taking the inner product of the four-momentum with itself:

:&lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{P}\|^2 = P^\mu P_\mu = m_0^2 U^\mu U_\mu = m_0^2 c^2&lt;/math&gt;

and also:

:&lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{P}\|^2 = \frac{E^2}{c^2} - \mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{p} &lt;/math&gt;

which leads to the [[energy–momentum relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 = c^2 \mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{p} + (m_0c^2)^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This last relation is useful [[relativistic mechanics]], essential in [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] and [[relativistic quantum field theory]], all with applications to [[particle physics]].

=== Four-force ===

The [[four-force]] acting on a particle is defined analogously to the 3-force as the time derivative of 3-momentum in [[Newton's second law]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac {d \mathbf{P}} {d \tau} = \gamma(\mathbf{u})\left(\frac{1}{c}\frac{dE}{dt},\frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}\right) = \gamma(\mathbf{u})(P/c,\mathbf{f}) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is the [[power (physics)|power]] transferred to move the particle, and '''f''' is the 3-force acting on the particle. For a particle of constant invariant mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, this is equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = m_0 \mathbf{A} = m_0\gamma(\mathbf{u})\left( \frac{d{\gamma}(\mathbf{u})}{dt} c, \left(\frac{d{\gamma}(\mathbf{u})}{dt} \mathbf{u} + \gamma(\mathbf{u}) \mathbf{a}\right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

An invariant derived from the four-force is:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{U} = F^\mu U_\mu = m_0 A^\mu U_\mu = 0&lt;/math&gt;

from the above result.

==Thermodynamics==

{{see also|Relativistic heat conduction}}

===Four-heat flux===

The four-heat flux vector field, is essentially similar to the 3d [[heat flux]] vector field '''q''', in the local frame of the fluid:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Y. M. |last=Ali |first2=L. C. |last2=Zhang |title=Relativistic heat conduction |journal=Int. J. Heat Mass Trans. |volume=48 |year=2005 |issue=12 |pages= |doi=10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2005.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q} = -k \boldsymbol{\partial} T = - k\left( \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}, \nabla T\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is [[absolute temperature]] and ''k'' is [[thermal conductivity]].

===Four-baryon number flux===

The flux of baryons is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne |publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co|year=1973|pages=558–559|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}= n\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the [[number density]] of [[baryon]]s in the local [[rest frame]] of the baryon fluid (positive values for baryons, negative for [[antiparticle|anti]]baryons), and '''U''' the [[four-velocity]] field (of the fluid) as above.

===Four-entropy===

The four-[[entropy]] vector is defined by:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne |publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co|year=1973|page=567|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}= s\mathbf{S} + \frac{\mathbf{Q}}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the entropy per baryon, and ''T'' the [[absolute temperature]], in the local rest frame of the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne |publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co|year=1973|page=558|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electromagnetism==

Examples of four-vectors in [[electromagnetism]] include the following.

===Four-current===

The electromagnetic [[four-current]] (or more correctly a four-current density)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |title=Introduction to Special Relativity
 |edition=2nd
 |first1=Wolfgang
 |last1=Rindler
 |publisher=Oxford Science Publications
 |year=1991
 |isbn=0-19-853952-5
 |pages=103–107
 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKUPAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J} = \left( \rho c, \mathbf{j} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

formed from the [[current density]] '''j''' and [[charge density]] ''ρ''.

===Four-potential===

The [[electromagnetic four-potential]] (or more correctly a four-EM vector potential) defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \left( \frac{\phi}{c}, \mathbf{a} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

formed from the [[vector potential]] '''a''' and the scalar potential ''ϕ''.

The four-potential is not uniquely determined, because it depends on a choice of [[Coulomb gauge#Coulomb gauge|gauge]].

In the [[wave equation]] for the electromagnetic field:
:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{\partial} \cdot \mathbf{\partial}) \mathbf{A} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; {in vacuum}
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{\partial} \cdot \mathbf{\partial}) \mathbf{A} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; {with a [[four-current]] source and using the [[Lorenz gauge condition]] &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{\partial} \cdot \mathbf{A}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}

==Waves==

===Four-frequency===

A photonic [[plane wave]] can be described by the [[four-frequency]] defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N} = \nu\left(1 , \hat{\mathbf{n}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ν'' is the frequency of the wave and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[unit vector]] in the travel direction of the wave. Now:

:&lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{N}\| = N^\mu N_\mu = \nu ^2 \left(1 - \hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}\right) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

so the four-frequency of a photon is always a null vector.

===Four-wavevector===

{{see also|De Broglie relation}}

The quantities reciprocal to time ''t'' and space '''r''' are the [[angular frequency]] ''ω'' and [[wave vector]] '''k''', respectively. They form the components of the four-wavevector or wave four-vector:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{k}} \right) = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \frac{\omega}{v_p}\mathbf{\hat{n}} \right) \,. &lt;/math&gt;

A wave packet of nearly [[monochromatic]] light can be described by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \frac{2\pi}{c}\mathbf{N} = \frac{2\pi}{c} \nu(1,\hat{\mathbf{n}}) = \frac{\omega}{c}\left( 1 , \hat{\mathbf{n}} \right) \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The de Broglie relations then showed that four-wavevector applied to [[matter wave]]s as well as to light waves. :

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \hbar \mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{E}{c},\vec{p}\right) = \hbar \left(\frac{\omega}{c},\vec{k} \right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

yielding &lt;math&gt;E = \hbar \omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = \hbar \vec{k}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''ħ'' is the [[Planck constant]] divided by 2''π''.

The square of the norm is:
:&lt;math&gt;\| \mathbf{K} \|^2 = K^\mu K_\mu = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^2 - \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{k}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and by the de Broglie relation:

:&lt;math&gt; \| \mathbf{K} \|^2 = \frac{1}{\hbar^2} \| \mathbf{P} \|^2 = \left(\frac{m_0 c}{\hbar}\right)^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

we have the matter wave analogue of the energy–momentum relation:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^2 - \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{k} = \left(\frac{m_0 c}{\hbar}\right)^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that for massless particles, in which case {{nowrap|1=''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^2 = \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{k} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

or ||'''k'''|| = ''ω''/''c''. Note this is consistent with the above case; for photons with a 3-wavevector of modulus ''ω''/''c'', in the direction of wave propagation defined by the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Quantum theory==

===Four-probability current===

In [[quantum mechanics]], the four-[[probability current]] or probability four-current is analogous to the [[Four-current|electromagnetic four-current]]:&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir G. Ivancevic, Tijana T. Ivancevic (2008) ''Quantum leap: from Dirac and Feynman, across the universe, to human body and mind''. World Scientific Publishing Company, {{ISBN|978-981-281-927-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qyK95FevVbIC&amp;pg=PA41 p. 41]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = (\rho c, \mathbf{j}) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the [[probability density function]] corresponding to the time component, and '''j''' is the [[probability current]] vector. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, this current is always well defined because the expressions for density and current are positive definite and can admit a probability interpretation. In [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]], it is not always possible to find a current, particularly when interactions are involved.

Replacing the energy by the [[energy operator]] and the momentum by the [[momentum operator]] in the four-momentum, one obtains the [[four-momentum operator]], used in [[relativistic wave equation]]s.

===Four-spin===

The [[four-spin]] of a particle is defined in the rest frame of a particle to be

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} = (0,\mathbf{s}) &lt;/math&gt;

where '''s''' is the [[spin (physics)|spin]] pseudovector. In quantum mechanics, not all three components of this vector are simultaneously measurable, only one component is. The timelike component is zero in the particle's rest frame, but not in any other frame. This component can be found from an appropriate Lorentz transformation.

The norm squared is the (negative of the) magnitude squared of the spin, and according to quantum mechanics we have

:&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{S}\|^2 = - |\mathbf{s}|^2 = -\hbar^2s(s+1)&lt;/math&gt;

This value is observable and quantized, with ''s'' the [[spin quantum number]] (not the magnitude of the spin vector).

==Other formulations==

===Four-vectors in the algebra of physical space===

A four-vector ''A'' can also be defined in using the [[Pauli matrices]] as a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], again in various equivalent notations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages= 1142–1143|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne | title=[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]| publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co| year=1973 | isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\mathbf{A} &amp; = (A^0, \, A^1, \, A^2, \, A^3) \\
&amp; = A^0\boldsymbol{\sigma}_0 + A^1 \boldsymbol{\sigma}_1 + A^2 \boldsymbol{\sigma}_2 + A^3  \boldsymbol{\sigma}_3 \\
&amp; = A^0\boldsymbol{\sigma}_0 + A^i \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i \\
&amp; = A^\alpha\boldsymbol{\sigma}_\alpha\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or explicitly:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\mathbf{A} &amp; = A^0\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} + A^1 \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} + A^2 \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -i \\ i &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} + A^3  \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix} \\
&amp; = \begin{pmatrix} A^0 + A^3 &amp; A^1 -i A^2 \\ A^1 + i A^2 &amp; A^0 - A^3 \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and in this formulation, the four-vector is represented as a [[Hermitian matrix]] (the [[matrix transpose]] and [[complex conjugate]] of the matrix leaves it unchanged), rather than a real-valued column or row vector. The [[determinant]] of the matrix is the modulus of the four-vector, so the determinant is an invariant:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
|\mathbf{A}| &amp; = \begin{vmatrix} A^0 + A^3 &amp; A^1 -i A^2 \\ A^1 + i A^2 &amp; A^0 - A^3 \end{vmatrix} \\
&amp; = (A^0 + A^3)(A^0 - A^3)  - (A^1 -i A^2)(A^1 + i A^2) \\
&amp; = (A^0)^2 - (A^1)^2 - (A^2)^2 - (A^3)^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This idea of using the Pauli matrices as [[basis vector]]s is employed in the [[algebra of physical space]], an example of a [[Clifford algebra]].

===Four-vectors in spacetime algebra===

In [[spacetime algebra]], another example of Clifford algebra, the [[gamma matrices]] can also form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. (They are also called the Dirac matrices, owing to their appearance in the [[Dirac equation]]). There is more than one way to express the gamma matrices, detailed in that main article.

The [[Feynman slash notation]] is a shorthand for a four-vector '''A''' contracted with the gamma matrices:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\!\!\!\!/ = A_\alpha \gamma^\alpha = A_0 \gamma^0 + A_1 \gamma^1 + A_2 \gamma^2 + A_3 \gamma^3 &lt;/math&gt;

The four-momentum contracted with the gamma matrices is an important case in [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] and [[relativistic quantum field theory]]. In the Dirac equation and other [[relativistic wave equation]]s, terms of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}\!\!\!\!/ = P_\alpha \gamma^\alpha = P_0 \gamma^0 + P_1 \gamma^1 + P_2 \gamma^2 + P_3 \gamma^3 = \dfrac{E}{c} \gamma^0 - p_x \gamma^1 - p_y \gamma^2 - p_z \gamma^3 &lt;/math&gt;

appear, in which the energy ''E'' and momentum components {{nowrap|(''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} are replaced by their respective [[operator (physics)|operator]]s.

The '''frictionless plane''' is a concept from the writings of [[Galileo Galilei]]. In his 1608 ''[[Two_New_Sciences#Day_3_Naturally_accelerated_motion|The Two New Sciences]]'', Galileo presented a formula that predicted the motion of an object moving down an [[inclined plane]]. His formula was based upon his past experimentation with free-falling bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Stillman, ''Galileo’s Experimental Confirmation of Horizontal Inertia: Unpublished Manuscripts.'' ''Isis'': Vol. 64, No. 3, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his model was not based upon experimentation with objects moving down an inclined plane, but from his conceptual modeling of the forces acting upon the object. Galileo understood the mechanics of the inclined plane as the combination of horizontal and vertical [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]]; the result of [[gravity]] acting upon the object, diverted by the [[slope]] of the plane.&lt;ref&gt;Settle, T. B. "An Experiment in the History of Science", ''Science'', 1061 ''133'' 19–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Galileo's equations do not contemplate [[friction]], and therefore do not perfectly predict the results of an actual [[experiment]]. This is because some energy is always lost when one mass applies a non-zero [[normal force]] to another. Therefore, the observed [[speed]], [[acceleration]] and distance traveled should be less than Galileo predicts.&lt;ref&gt; Jenkin, Fleeming. ''On Friction Between Surfaces at Low Speeds.'' Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 26 p. 93–94 &lt;/ref&gt; This energy is lost in forms like sound and heat. However, from Galileo's predictions of an object moving down an inclined plane in a frictionless environment, he created the theoretical foundation for extremely fruitful real-world experimental prediction.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, at p. 297–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Frictionless planes do not exist in the real world. However, if they did, one can be almost certain that objects on them would behave exactly as Galileo predicts. Despite their nonexistence, they have considerable value in the design of engines, motors, roadways, and even tow-truck beds, to name a few examples.&lt;ref&gt; Koyré, Alexandre ''Metaphysics and Measurement'', pp. 83–84 (1992). &lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of friction on an object moving down an inclined plane can be calculated as

:&lt;math&gt; F_\mathrm{f} = \mu_\mathrm{k} F_\mathrm{N}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; F_\mathrm{f} &lt;/math&gt; is the force of friction exerted by the object and the inclined plane on each other, parallel to the surface of the plane, &lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[normal force]] exerted by the object and the plane on each other, directed perpendicular to the plane, and &lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of [[Friction#Kinetic_friction|kinetic friction]].&lt;ref&gt; Koyré, pp. 84–86. &lt;/ref&gt;

Unless the inclined plane is in a [[vacuum]], a (usually) small amount of [[potential energy]] is also lost to [[air drag]].

'''''Geist''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡaɪst}}) is a [[German language|German]] noun with a degree of importance in [[German philosophy]]. Its [[semantic field]] corresponds to English [[ghost]], [[spirit]], [[mind]], [[intellect]]. Some English translators resort to using "spirit/mind" or "spirit (mind)" to help convey the meaning of the term.&lt;ref&gt;C. Marvin Pate. ''From Plato to Jesus: What Does Philosophy Have to Do with Theology?''. 2011, page 69.
Rosenkranz, Karl. ''Hegel, as the national philosopher of Germany''. 1874, page 85&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Geist'' is also a central concept in [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s 1807 ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (''Phänomenologie des Geistes''). Notable compounds, all associated with Hegel's view of [[world history]] of the late 18th century, include  '''''Weltgeist''''' "world-spirit", '''''Volksgeist''''' "national spirit"  and  '''''Zeitgeist'''''   "spirit of the age".

==Etymology and translation==
{{see|Spirit|Pneuma|Psyche (psychology)}}
German ''Geist'' (masculine gender) continues [[Old High German]] ''geist'', attested as the translation of Latin ''spiritus''. 
It is the direct cognate of English ''[[:wikt:ghost|ghost]]'', from a [[West Germanic]] ''gaistaz''. Its derivation from a [[PIE root]] ''g̑heis-'' "to be agitated, frightened" suggests that the Germanic word originally referred to frightening  (c.f. English [[:wikt:ghastly|ghastly]]) apparitions or [[ghost]]s, and may also have carried the connotation of "ecstatic agitation, ''[[odhr|furor]]''" related to the cult of [[Germanic Mercury]]. 
As the translation of biblical Latin ''spiritus'' (Greek πνεῦμα) "[[pneuma|spirit, breath]]" the Germanic word acquires a Christian meaning from an early time, notably in reference to the [[Holy Spirit]] (Old English ''sē hālga gāst'' "the Holy Ghost", OHG '' ther heilago geist'', Modern German ''der Heilige Geist'').
The English word is in competition with Latinate ''spirit'' from the Middle English period, but its broader meaning is preserved well into the early modern period.&lt;ref&gt;As observed by [[Alexander Gil]], ''The sacred philosophy of the holy scripture: laid down... in... the apostles'' (1635): "The word Ghost in English [...] is as much as athem, or breath; in our new Latin language, a Spirit." Spenser in 1590 could still say ''No knight so rude, I weene, As to doen outrage to a sleeping ghost'' (''[[Faerie Queene]]'' II. viii. 26), by "sleeping ghost" referring to the sleeping mind of a living person, not the ghost of a deceased one.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German noun much like English ''spirit'' could refer to spooks or ghostly apparitions of the dead,  to the religious concept, as in the Holy Spirit, as well as to the "spirit of wine", i.e. [[ethanol]]. 
However, its special meaning of "[[mind]], [[intellect]]" never shared by English ''ghost'' is acquired only in the 18th century, under the influence of French ''esprit''.
In this sense it became extremely productive in the German language of the 18th century in general as well as in 18th-century German philosophy.
''Geist'' could now refer to the quality of intellectual brilliance, to wit, innovation, erudition, etc.
It is also in this time that the adjectival distinction of ''geistlich'' "spiritual, pertaining to religion" vs. ''geistig'' "intellectual, pertaining to the mind" begins to be made. Reference to spooks or ghosts  is made by the adjective ''geisterhaft'' "ghostly, spectral".&lt;ref name=Pfeifer&gt;[https://www.dwds.de/wb/Geist#et-1 Geist] in Wolfgang Pfeifer, ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch'' ([1989] 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous [[German compounds|compounds]] are formed in the 18th to 19th centuries, some of them loan translations of French expressions, such as ''Geistesgegenwart'' = ''présence d'esprit'' ("mental presence, acuity"), ''Geistesabwesenheit'' = ''absence d’esprit'' ("mental absence,  distraction"), ''geisteskrank'' "mentally ill", ''geistreich'' "witty, intellectually brilliant", ''geistlos'' "unintelligent, unimaginative, vacuous" etc. 
It is from these developments that certain German compounds containing ''-geist'' have been loaned into English, such as ''[[Zeitgeist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Zeitgeist'' "spirit of the epoch" and ''Nationalgeist'' "spirit of a nation" in L. Meister, ''Eine kurze Geschichte der Menschenrechte'' (1789).
''der frivole Welt- und Zeitgeist'' ("the frivolous spirit of the world and the time") in [[Lavater]], ''Handbibliothek für Freunde'' 5 (1791), p. 57.
''Zeitgeist'' is popularized by [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Goethe]].

German ''Geist'' in this particular sense of "mind, wit, erudition; intangible essence, spirit" has no precise English-language equivalent, for which reason translators sometimes retain ''Geist'' as a German loanword.

== Hegelianism ==
''Geist'' is a central concept in [[Hegel]]'s ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (''Phänomenologie des Geistes'').  According to Hegel, the ''Weltgeist'' ("world spirit") is not an actual object or a transcendental, Godlike thing, but a means of philosophizing about history.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}  ''Weltgeist'' is effected in history through the [[mediation]] of various ''[[Volksgeist]]er'' ("national spirits"), the [[hero|great men]] of history, such as [[Napoleon]], are the "[[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] [[universality (philosophy)|universal]]".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

This has led some to claim that Hegel favored the [[great man theory]], although his [[philosophy of history]], in particular concerning the role of the "[[universality (philosophy)|universal]] state" (''Universalstaat'', which means a universal "order" or "statute" rather than "[[State (polity)|state]]"), and of an "End of History" is much more complex.

For Hegel, the great hero is unwittingly utilized by ''Geist'' or ''absolute spirit'', by a "ruse of reason" as he puts it, and is irrelevant to history once his historic mission is accomplished; he is thus subjected to the [[teleology|teleological]] principle of history, a principle which allows Hegel to reread the history of philosophy as culminating in his philosophy of history.

''Weltgeist'', the world spirit concept, designates an [[idealism|idealistic]] principle of world explanation, which can be found from the beginnings of philosophy up to more recent time. The concept of world spirit was already accepted by the idealistic schools of ancient Indian philosophy, whereby one explained [[objective reality]] as its product. (See [[metaphysical objectivism]]) In the early philosophy of Greek antiquity, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] all paid homage, amongst other things, to the [[concept]] of world spirit. Hegel later based his philosophy of history on it.

==''Weltgeist''==
{{see|Anima Mundi}}
''Weltgeist'' "world-spirit" is older than the 18th century, at first (16th century) in the sense of "secularism, impiety, irreligiosity" (''spiritus mundi''), in the 17th century also personalised in the sense of  "man of the world", "mundane or secular person".
Also from the 17th century, ''Weltgeist'' acquired a philosophical or spiritual sense of "world-spirit" or "world-soul" (''anima mundi, spiritus universi'') in the sense of [[Panentheism]], a spiritual essence permeating all of nature, or the active principle animating the universe, including the physical sense, such as the attraction  between [[magnetic force|magnet and iron]] or between [[Gravity|Moon and tide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://woerterbuchnetz.de/cgi-bin/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=DWB&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;lemid=GW16923#XGW16923 Weltgeist] in Grimm, ''Deutsches Wörterbuch''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea of ''Weltgeist'' in the sense of ''anima mundi'' became very influential in 18th-century German philosophy. In philosophical contexts, ''der Geist'' on its own could refer to this concept, as in [[Christian Thomasius]], ''Versuch vom Wesen des Geistes'' (1709).&lt;ref&gt; Rudolf Eisler''Wörterbuch der philosophischen Begriffe'' (1904),  406ff., 1760f.&lt;/ref&gt;
Belief in a ''Weltgeist'' as animating principle immanent to the universe became dominant in German thought due to the influence of [[Goethe]], in the later part of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, ''Geist der Göthezeit'' (1923).&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the  poetical language of Johann Ulrich von König (d. 1745), the ''Weltgeist'' 
appears as the active, masculine principle opposite the feminine principle of [[Nature]].
&lt;ref&gt;J. U. von König, ''Gedichte'' (1745) p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;
''Weltgeist'' in the sense of Goethe comes close to being a synonym of [[God]] and can be attributed agency and will. 
[[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], who tended to prefer the form ''Weltengeist'' (as it were "spirit of worlds"), pushes this to the point of composing prayers addressed to this world-spirit:
:'' O Weltengeist, Bist du so gütig, wie du mächtig bist, Enthülle mir, den du mitfühlend zwar, Und doch so grausam schufst, erkläre mir Das Loos der Fühlenden, die durch mich leiden.''
:"O World-spirit, be as benevolent as you are powerful and reveal to me, whom you have created with compassion and yet cruelly, explain to me the lot of the sentient, who suffer through me"&lt;ref&gt;Herder, "Die Gärten der Hesperiden", ''Ausgewählte Werke'' 1, ed. Kurz (1871), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hegel-and-Napoleon-in-Jena-1806.jpg|thumb|upright|"Hegel and Napoleon in Jena" (illustration from ''Harper's Magazine'', 1895)]]
The term was notably embraced by [[Hegel]] and his followers in the early 19th century.
For the 19th century, the term as used by [[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Hegel (1807)]] became prevalent, less in the sense of an animating principle of nature or the universe but as the invisible force advancing [[world history]]:
:''Im Gange der Geschichte ist das eine wesentliche Moment die Erhaltung eines Volkes [...] das andere Moment aber ist, daß der Bestand eines Volksgeistes, wie er ist, durchbrochen wird, weil er sich ausgeschöpft und ausgearbeitet hat, daß die Weltgeschichte, der Weltgeist fortgeht.''
:"In the course of history one relevant factor is the preservation of a [[Volk|nation]] [...] while the other factor is that the continued existence of a national spirit [''Volksgeist''] is interrupted because it has exhausted and spent itself, so that world history, the world spirit [''Weltgeist''], proceeds."&lt;ref&gt; Hegel, ''Vorlesungen über die Philosophie der Weltgeschichte''  (ed. 1944), 96f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's description of [[Napoleon]] as "the world-soul on horseback" (''die Weltseele zu Pferde'') became proverbial.
The phrase is a shortened paraphrase of Hegel's words in  a letter written  on 13 October 1806, the day before the [[Battle of Jena]], to his friend   [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I saw the Emperor – this world-soul – riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|den Kaiser – diese Weltseele – sah ich durch die Stadt zum Rekognoszieren hinausreiten; es ist in der Tat eine wunderbare Empfindung, ein solches Individuum zu sehen, das hier auf einen Punkt konzentriert, auf einem Pferde sitzend, über die Welt übergreift und sie beherrscht.}}
Hegel, letter of  13 October 1806  to F. I. Niethammer,  no. 74 (p. 119) in ''Briefe von und an Hegel'' ed. Hoffmeister, vol. 1 (1970), cited after H. Schnädelbach in Wolfgang Welsch, Klaus Vieweg (eds.), ''Das Interesse des Denkens: Hegel aus heutiger Sicht'', 
Wilhelm Fink Verlag (2003),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=NrkPdUO5VRsC&amp;pg=PA233  p. 223]; trans. Pinkard (2000:228).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The letter was not published in Hegel's time, but the expression was attributed to Hegel anecdotally, appearing in print from 1859.&lt;ref&gt;L. Noack, ''Schelling und die Philosophie der Romantik'', 1859, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=7NO__b_nwrsC&amp;pg=PA153 p. 153]&lt;/ref&gt;
It is used without attribution by [[Meyer Kayserling]] in his ''Sephardim'' (1859:103), and is apparently not recognized as a reference to Hegel by the reviewer in ''[[Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen]]'', who notes it disapprovingly, as one of Kayserling's "bad jokes"  (''schlechte Witze'').&lt;ref&gt;''Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen'' 2 (1861) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=4zBFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA770  p. 770],&lt;/ref&gt;
The phrase become widely associated with Hegel later in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt; e.g. G. Baur in ''Reden gehalten in der Aula der Universität Leipzig beim Rectoratswechsel am 31. October 1874'' (1874), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=INxiAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 36].&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Volksgeist''==
{{redirect|National spirit|the racehorse|National Spirit (horse)|the horse race|National Spirit Hurdle}}
{{see|National character|Ethnic essentialism}}
''Volksgeist'' or ''Nationalgeist'' refers to a "spirit" of an individual [[Volk|people (''Volk'')]], its "national spirit" or "national character".
The term ''Nationalgeist'' is used in the 1760s by [[Justus Möser]] and by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]. The term ''Nation'' at this time is used in the sense of ''[[:wikt:natio#Latin|natio]]'' "nation, ethnic group, race", mostly replaced by the term ''Volk'' after 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Mährlein, ''Volksgeist und Recht. Hegels Philosophie der Einheit und ihre Bedeutung in der Rechtswissenschaft'', Königshausen &amp; Neumann, Würzburg (2000), 17f.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the early 19th century, the term ''Volksgeist'' was used by [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] in order to express the "popular" sense of [[justice]].
Savigniy explicitly referred to the concept of an ''esprit des nations '' used by [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Essai sur les mœurs et l’esprit des nations'', 1756.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the ''esprit général'' invoked by  [[Montesquieu]].&lt;ref&gt;''Vom Geist der Gesetze'', 1748.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel uses the term in his ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]''.
Based on the Hegelian use of the term, [[Wilhelm Wundt]], [[Moritz Lazarus]] and [[Heymann Steinthal]] in the mid-19th-century established the field of ''Völkerpsychologie'' ("psychology of nations").

In Germany the concept of Volksgeist has developed and changed its meaning through eras and fields. The most important examples are: In the literary field, [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|Schlegel]] and the [[Brothers Grimm]]. In the history of cultures, [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]. In the history of the State or political history, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. In the field of law, [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Savigny]] and in the field of psychology [[Wilhelm Wundt|Wundt]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]]: ''Volksgeist-Herri Gogoa. Ilustraziotik nazismora'', p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the concept is ambiguous. Furthermore it is not limited to [[Romanticism]] as it is commonly known.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]]: ''Volksgeist-Herri Gogoa. Ilustraziotik nazismora'', p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The concept of was also influential in American cultural anthropology. According to the historian of anthropology [[George W. Stocking, Jr.]], "… one may trace the later American anthropological idea of culture back through Bastian's Volkergedanken and the folk psychologist's Volksgeister to Wilhelm von Humboldt's Nationalcharakter -- and behind that, although not without a paradoxical and portentous residue of conceptual and ideological ambiguity, to the Herderian ideal of Volksgeist."{{huh|date=March 2018}}{{year needed|date=March 2018}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

==''Zeitgeist''==
{{main article|Zeitgeist}}
{{See also|Multiple discovery|Epochalism}}
The compound ''Zeitgeist''  ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|aɪ|t|ɡ|aɪ|s|t}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/zeitgeist oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com]&lt;/ref&gt;, "spirit of the age" or "spirit of the times") similarly to ''Weltgeist'' describes 
an invisible agent or force dominating the characteristics of a given epoch in [[world history]].
The term is now mostly associated with [[Hegel]], contrasting with Hegel's use of ''Volksgeist'' "national spirit" and ''Weltgeist'' "world-spirit", 
but its coinage and popularization precedes Hegel, and is mostly due to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;''Zeitgeist'' "spirit of the epoch" and ''Nationalgeist'' "spirit of a nation" in L. Meister, ''Eine kurze Geschichte der Menschenrechte'' (1789).
''der frivole Welt- und Zeitgeist'' ("the frivolous spirit of the world and the time") in [[Lavater]], ''Handbibliothek für Freunde'' 5 (1791), p. 57.
''Zeitgeist'' is popularized by [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Goethe]].
[http://woerterbuchnetz.de/cgi-bin/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=DWB&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;hitlist=&amp;patternlist=&amp;lemid=GZ03558#XGZ03567 Zeitgeist] in Grimm, ''Deutsches Wörterbuch''.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The term as used contemporarily may more pragmatically refer to  a [[fad|fashion or fad]] which prescribes what is acceptable or tasteful, e.g. in the field of [[architecture]].&lt;ref name=StF&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvqZt9ZnmYUC&amp;printsec=frontcover |author=Eero Saarinen |title=Shaping the Future |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-972-48812-9 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yvqZt9ZnmYUC&amp;pg=PA15 15]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel in ''[[Phenomenology of the Spirit]]'' (1807) uses both ''Weltgeist'' and ''Volksgeist'' but prefers the phrase ''Geist der Zeiten'' "spirit of the times" over the [[German compound|compound]] ''Zeitgeist''.&lt;ref&gt;
c.f. use of the phrase {{lang|de|der Geist seiner Zeit}} ("the spirit of his time") in  ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'', for example, "no man can surpass his own time, for the spirit of his time is also his own spirit." {{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;printsec=frontcover |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=Zeitgeist |title=The Hegel Dictionary |author=Glenn Alexander Magee |publisher=[[A &amp; C Black]] |location=London |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-847-06591-9 &lt;!--|ISBN=1-84706591-0 --&gt;|chapter=Zeitgeist (p. 262)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel believed that culture and art reflected its time. Thus, he argued{{year needed|date=March 2018}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}} that it would be impossible to produce classical art in the modern world, as modernity is essentially a  "free and ethical culture".{{huh|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Hendrix, John Shannon. ''Aesthetics &amp; The Philosophy Of Spirit''. New York: Peter Lang. (2005). 4, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used more widely in the  sense of an intellectual or aesthetic [[fashion]] or [[fad]].
For example, [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 proposition that [[evolution]] occurs by [[natural selection]] has been cited as a case of the ''zeitgeist'' of the epoch, an idea "whose time had come", seeing that his contemporary, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], was outlining similar models during the same period.&lt;ref name="Hothersall"&gt;Hothersall, D., "History of Psychology", 2004, {{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Similarly, intellectual fashions such as the emergence of [[logical positivism]] in the 1920s, leading to a focus on [[behaviorism]] and [[blank-slatism]] over the following decades, and later, during the 1950s to 1960s,  the  shift from behaviorism to [[post-modernism]] and [[critical theory]]  can be argued to be an expression of the intellectual or academic "zeitgeist".&lt;ref name="Hothersall"/&gt;
''Zeitgeist'' in more recent usage has been used by Forsyth (2009) in reference to his "theory of [[leadership]]"&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2009"&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2009). Group dynamics: New York: Wadsworth. [Chapter 9]&lt;/ref&gt; and in other publications describing models of business or industry.
[[Malcolm Gladwell]] argued in his book ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'' that entrepreneurs who succeeded in the early stages of a nascent industry often share similar characteristics.

A '''gift economy''', '''gift culture''', or '''gift exchange''' is a mode of exchange where [[Anthropological theories of value|valuables]] are not [[traded]] or sold, but rather given without an explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards.&lt;ref name="Cheal "&gt;{{cite book |last=Cheal |first=David J |title=The Gift Economy |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1988 |pages=1–19 |chapter=1 |isbn=0415006414 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=o-wNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This exchange contrasts with a [[barter economy]] or a [[market economy]], where [[goods and services]] are primarily exchanged for value received. Social norms and custom govern gift exchange. Gifts are not given in an explicit exchange of goods or services for [[money]] or some other [[commodity]].&lt;ref name="R. Kranton"&gt;R. Kranton: ''Reciprocal exchange: a self-sustaining system'', American Economic Review, V. 86 (1996), Issue 4 (September), p. 830-51&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of gift economies forms the subject of a foundational debate in anthropology. Anthropological research into gift economies began with [[Bronisław Malinowski]]'s description of the [[Kula ring]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malinowski |first=Bronislaw |title=Argonauts of the Western Pacific |year=1922 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Trobriand Islands]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keesing |first1=Roger |last2=Strathern |first2=Andrew |title=Cultural Anthropology. A Contemporary Perspective |year=1988 |publisher=Harcourt Brace and Company |location=Fort Worth |page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kula trade appeared to be gift-like since Trobrianders would travel great distances over dangerous seas to give what were considered valuable objects without any guarantee of a return. Malinowski's debate with the French anthropologist [[Marcel Mauss]] quickly established the complexity of "gift exchange" and introduced a series of technical terms such as [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], [[inalienable possessions]], and prestation to distinguish between the different forms of exchange.&lt;ref name="Mauss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiner" /&gt;

According to anthropologists [[Maurice Bloch]] and Jonathan Parry, it is the unsettled relationship between market and non-market exchange that attracts the most attention. Gift economies are said, by some,&lt;ref&gt;Bollier, David. "The Stubborn Vitality of the Gift Economy." Silent Theft: The Private Plunder of Our Common Wealth. First Printing ed. New York: Routledge, 2002. 38-39. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; to build communities, with the market serving as an acid on those relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=J. Parry |first=M. Bloch |title="Introduction" in Money and the Morality of Exchange |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=8–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gift exchange is distinguished from other forms of exchange by a number of principles, such as the form of property rights governing the articles exchanged; whether gifting forms a distinct "sphere of exchange" that can be characterized as an "economic system"; and the character of the social relationship that the gift exchange establishes. Gift ideology in highly commercialized societies differs from the "prestations" typical of non-market societies. Gift economies must also be differentiated from several closely related phenomena, such as common property regimes and the exchange of non-commodified labour.

According to anthropologist Jonathan Parry, discussion on the nature of gifts, and of a separate sphere of gift exchange that would constitute an economic system, has been plagued by the [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] use of modern, western, market society-based conception of the gift applied as if it were a cross-cultural, pan-historical universal. However, he claims that anthropologists, through analysis of a variety of cultural and historical forms of exchange, have established that no universal practice exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry |first=Jonathan |title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift' |journal=Man |year=1986 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=453–473 |doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt; His classic summation of the gift exchange debate highlighted that ideologies of the "pure gift"  "are most likely to arise in highly differentiated societies with an advanced division of labour and a significant commercial sector" and need to be distinguished from non-market "prestations".&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 467"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry |first=Jonathan |title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift' |journal=Man |year=1986 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=467 |doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Weiner, to speak of a "gift economy" in a non-market society is to ignore the distinctive features of their exchange relationships, as the early classic debate between [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] and [[Marcel Mauss]] demonstrated.&lt;ref name="Mauss"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mauss |first=Marcel |title=The Gift: Forms and Functions of Exchange in Archaic Societies |year=1970 |publisher=Cohen &amp; West |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiner"&gt;{{cite book |last=Weiner |first=Annette |title=Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-while-Giving |year=1992 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gift exchange is frequently "[[Embeddedness|embedded]]" in political, kin, or religious institutions, and therefore does not constitute an "economic" system per se.&lt;ref name="gregory"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Chris |title=Gifts and Commodities |year=1982 |publisher=Academic Press |location=London |pages=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Property and alienability===
Gift-giving is a form of transfer of property rights over particular objects. The nature of those property rights varies from society to society, from culture to culture, and are not universal. The nature of gift-giving is thus altered by the type of property regime in place.&lt;ref name="hann"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hann |first=C.M. |title=Property Relations: Renewing the Anthropological Tradition |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bundle of rights|Property is not a thing]], but a relationship amongst people about things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sider |first=Gerald M. |title=The Ties That Bind: Culture and Agriculture, Property and Propriety in the Newfoundland Village Fishery |journal=Social History |year=1980 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=2–3, 17 |doi=10.1080/03071028008567469}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Chris Hann]], property is a social relationship that governs the conduct of people with respect to the use and disposition of things. Anthropologists analyze these relationships in terms of a variety of actors' (individual or corporate) "[[bundle of rights]]" over objects.&lt;ref name="hann" /&gt; An example is the current debates around [[intellectual property right]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coleman |first=Gabriella |title=The Political Agnosticism of Free and Open Source Software and the Inadvertent Politics of Contrast |journal=Anthropological Quarterly |year=2004 |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=507–19 |doi=10.1353/anq.2004.0035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levitt |first=Leon |title=On property, Intellectual Property, the Culture of Property, and Software Pirating |journal=Anthropology of Work Review |year=1987 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=7–9 |doi=10.1525/awr.1987.8.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Jonathan |journal=American Ethnologist |year=1999 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=1001–2 |doi=10.1525/ae.1999.26.4.1001 |title=The Cultural Life of Intellectual Properties: Authorship, Appropriation, and the Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aragon |first=Lorraine |author2=James Leach |title=Arts and Owners: Intellectual property law and the politics of scale in Indonesian Arts |journal=American Ethnologist |year=2008 |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=607–31 |doi=10.1111/j.1548-1425.2008.00101.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coombe |first=Rosemary J. |title=Cultural and Intellectual Properties: Occupying the Colonial Imagination |journal=PoLAR: Political and Legal Anthropology Review |year=1993 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=8–15 |doi=10.1525/pol.1993.16.1.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hann and Strangelove both give the example of a purchased book (an object that he owns), over which the author retains a "copyright". Although the book is a commodity, bought and sold, it has not been completely "alienated" from its creator who maintains a hold over it; the owner of the book is limited in what he can do with the book by the rights of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chris Hann |first=Keith Hart |title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique |year=2011 |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strangelove |first=Michael |title=The Empire of Mind: Digital Piracy and the Anti-Capitalist Movement |year=2005 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |pages=92–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weiner has argued that the ability to give while retaining a right to the gift/commodity is a critical feature of the gifting cultures described by Malinowski and Mauss, and explains, for example, why some gifts such as Kula valuables return to their original owners after an incredible journey around the Trobriand islands. The gifts given in Kula exchange still remain, in some respects, the property of the giver.&lt;ref name="Weiner" /&gt;

In the example used above, "copyright" is one of those bundled rights that regulate the use and disposition of a book. Gift-giving in many societies is complicated because "private property" owned by an individual may be quite limited in scope (see {{format link|#The commons}} below).&lt;ref name="hann" /&gt; Productive resources, such as land, may be held by members of a corporate group (such as a lineage), but only some members of that group may have "[[Use (law)|use rights]]". When many people hold rights over the same objects gifting has very different implications than the gifting of private property; only some of the rights in that object may be transferred, leaving that object still tied to its corporate owners. Anthropologist Annette Weiner refers to these types of objects as "[[inalienable possessions]]" and to the process as "keeping while giving".&lt;ref name="Weiner" /&gt;

===Gift vs. prestation===
[[File:Kula bracelet.jpg|thumbnail|A Kula necklace, with its distinctive red shell-disc beads, from the Trobriand Islands.]]
Malinowski's study of the [[Kula ring]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malinowski |first=Bronislaw |title=Argonauts of the Western Pacific : an account of native enterprise and adventure in the archipelagoes of Melanesian New Guinea |year=1984 |origyear=1922 |publisher=Waveland Press |location=Prospect Heights, Ill.}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the subject of debate with the French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, author of "[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]" ("Essai sur le don", 1925).&lt;ref name="Mauss" /&gt; In Parry's view, Malinowski placed the emphasis on the exchange of goods between ''individuals'', and their non-altruistic motives for giving the gift: they expected a return of equal or greater value. Malinowski stated that [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] is an implicit part of gifting; he contended there is no such thing as the "free gift" given without expectation.&lt;ref name="parry"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry |first=Jonathan |title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift' |journal=Man |year=1986 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=466–69 |doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mauss, in contrast, emphasized that the gifts were not between individuals, but between representatives of larger collectivities. These gifts were, he argued, a "total prestation". A prestation is a service provided out of a sense of obligation, like "community service".&lt;ref name="Hann, Chris 2011 50"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hann, Chris |first=Hart, Keith |title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique |year=2011 |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were not simple, alienable commodities to be bought and sold, but, like the "[[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown jewels]]", embodied the reputation, history and sense of identity of a "corporate kin group", such as a line of kings. Given the stakes, Mauss asked "why anyone would give them away?" His answer was an enigmatic concept, "the spirit of the gift". Parry believes that a good part of the confusion (and resulting debate) was due to a bad translation. Mauss appeared to be arguing that a return gift is given to keep the very relationship between givers alive; a failure to return a gift ends the relationship and the promise of any future gifts.

Both Malinowski and Mauss agreed that in non-market societies, where there was no clear institutionalized economic exchange system, gift/prestation exchange served economic, kinship, religious and political functions that could not be clearly distinguished from each other, and which mutually influenced the nature of the practice.&lt;ref name="parry" /&gt;

===Inalienable possessions===
[[File:Klallam people at Port Townsend.jpg|thumb | right | Watercolor by [[James G. Swan]] depicting the [[Klallam]] people of chief [[Chetzemoka]] at [[Port Townsend]], with one of Chetzemoka's wives distributing [[potlatch]].]]
Mauss' concept of "total prestations" was further developed by Annette Weiner, who revisited Malinowski's fieldsite in the Trobriand Islands. Her critique was twofold: first, Trobriand Island society is matrilineal, and women hold a great deal of economic and political power. Their exchanges were ignored by Malinowski. Secondly, she developed Mauss' argument about reciprocity and the "spirit of the gift" in terms of "[[inalienable possessions]]: the paradox of keeping while giving."&lt;ref name="Weiner" /&gt; Weiner contrasts "moveable goods" which can be exchanged with "immoveable goods" that serve to draw the gifts back (in the Trobriand case, male Kula gifts with women's landed property). She argues that the specific goods given, like Crown Jewels, are so identified with particular groups, that even when given, they are not truly alienated. Not all societies, however, have these kinds of goods, which depend upon the existence of particular kinds of kinship groups. French anthropologist Maurice Godelier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Godelier |first=Maurice |title=The Enigma of the Gift |year=1999 |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; pushed the analysis further in "The Enigma of the Gift" (1999). Albert Schrauwers has argued that the kinds of societies used as examples by Weiner and Godelier (including the [[Kula ring]] in the Trobriands, the [[Potlatch]] of the [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]], and the [[Toraja]] of [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]) are all characterized by ranked aristocratic kin groups that fit with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' model of "House Societies" (where "House" refers to both noble lineage and their landed estate). Total prestations are given, he argues, to preserve landed estates identified with particular kin groups and maintain their place in a ranked society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schrauwers |first=Albert |title=H(h)ouses, E(e)states and class: On the importance of capitals in central Sulawesi |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |year=2004 |volume=160 |issue=1 |pages=72–94 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reciprocity and the "spirit of the gift"===
According to [[Chris Gregory]] [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] is a dyadic exchange relationship that we characterize, imprecisely, as gift-giving. Gregory believes that one gives gifts to friends and potential enemies in order to establish a relationship, by placing them in debt. He also claimed that in order for such a relationship to persist, there must be a time lag between the gift and counter-gift; one or the other partner must always be in debt, or there is no relationship. Marshall Sahlins has stated that birthday gifts are an example of this.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sahlins |first=Marshall |authorlink=Marshall Sahlins |title=Stone Age Economics |publisher=Aldine-Atherton |location=Chicago |year=1972 |isbn=0-202-01099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}} Sahlins notes that birthday presents are separated in time so that one partner feels the obligation to make a return gift; and to forget the return gift may be enough to end the relationship. Gregory has stated that without a relationship of debt, there is no reciprocity, and that this is what distinguishes a gift economy from a "true gift" given with no expectation of return (something Sahlins calls "generalized reciprocity": see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Chris |title=Gifts and Commodities |year=1982 |publisher=Academic Press |location=London |pages=189–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall Sahlins]], an American cultural anthropologist, identified three main types of reciprocity in his book ''Stone Age Economics'' (1972). Gift or ''generalized reciprocity'' is the exchange of goods and services without keeping track of their exact value, but often with the expectation that their value will balance out over time. ''Balanced or Symmetrical reciprocity'' occurs when someone gives to someone else, expecting a fair and tangible return at a specified amount, time, and place. Market or ''Negative reciprocity'' is the exchange of goods and services where each party intends to profit from the exchange, often at the expense of the other. Gift economies, or generalized reciprocity, occurred within closely knit kin groups, and the more distant the exchange partner, the more balanced or negative the exchange became.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972" /&gt;

The "generalized reciprocity" time-lag in recent years, also applies as an allowance for spontaneity and creativity that enables both parties to demonstrate love in surprising ways. In a market exchange, the giving party loses an item to gain income while the receiving party loses income to gain an item, a +1 -1 transaction that leads to 0 goodwill remaining on average. In a giving relationship, the giving party loses the item, but gains the joy of doing good for someone they appreciate, while the receiving party still gains not just something, but something that is tailored to their tastes, transaction value +1(receiver) +1(giver)  -1(giver) +1(personalization as sign of love for the receiver) for a total of +2 goodwill added to the relationship. This expanding goodwill deepens social capital exchanged in close communities and leaves a "relationship bank" for community members to tap into when they are in need of help in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christmas wish list and giving traditions |url=https://www.dreamlist.com/best/ |website=DreamList.com |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is a core part of the culture of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Burning_Man Burning Man].

Weborn 04 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity, debt, and the "poison of the gift"===
Jonathan Parry has argued that ideologies of the "pure gift" "are most likely to arise only in highly differentiated societies with an advanced division of labour and a significant commercial sector" and need to be distinguished from the non-market "prestations" discussed above.&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 467" /&gt; Parry also underscored, using the example of charitable giving of alms in India ([[Dāna]]), that the "pure gift" of alms given with no expectation of return could be "poisonous". That is, the gift of alms embodying the sins of the giver, when given to ritually pure priests, saddled these priests with impurities that they could not cleanse themselves of. "Pure gifts", given without a return, can place recipients in debt, and hence in dependent status: the poison of the gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry |first=Jonathan |title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift' |journal=Man |year=1986 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=463–67 |doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Graeber points out that no reciprocity is expected between unequals: if you make a gift of a dollar to a beggar, he will not give it back the next time you meet. More than likely, he will ask for more, to the detriment of his status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graeber |first=David |title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams |year=2001 |publisher=Palgrave |location=New York |page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many who are forced by circumstances to accept charity feel stigmatized. In the [[Moka exchange|Moka]] exchange system of Papua New Guinea, where gift givers become political "big men", those who are in their debt and unable to repay with "interest" are referred to as "rubbish men".

The French writer [[Georges Bataille]], in ''La part Maudite'', uses Mauss's argument in order to construct a theory of economy: the structure of gift is the presupposition for all possible economy. Bataille is particularly interested in the potlatch as described by Mauss, and claims that its agonistic character obliges the receiver of the gift to confirm their own subjection. Gift-giving thus embodies the Hegelian dipole of master and slave within the act.

===Spheres of exchange and "economic systems"===
{{Economic systems sidebar |By coordination}}
The relationship of new market exchange systems to indigenous non-market exchange remained a perplexing question for anthropologists. [[Paul Bohannan]] argued that the Tiv of Nigeria had three [[spheres of exchange]], and that only certain kinds of goods could be exchanged in each sphere; each sphere had its own different form of special purpose money. However, the market and universal money allowed goods to be traded between spheres and thus served as an acid on established social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bohannan |first=Paul |title=The Impact of money on an African subsistence economy |journal=The Journal of Economic History |year=1959 |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=491–503 |doi=10.1017/S0022050700085946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Parry and [[Maurice Bloch]], argued in "Money and the Morality of Exchange" (1989), that the "transactional order" through which long-term social reproduction of the family takes place has to be preserved as separate from short-term market relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parry |first=Jonathan |title=Money and the Morality of Exchange |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=28–30 |authorlink=Introduction: Money and the Morality of Exchange |author2=Maurice Bloch}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the long-term social reproduction of the family that is sacralized by religious rituals such baptisms, weddings and funerals, and characterized by gifting.

In such situations where gift-giving and market exchange were intersecting for the first time, some anthropologists contrasted them as polar opposites. This opposition was classically expressed by Chris Gregory in his book "Gifts and Commodities" (1982). Gregory argued that
{{Quote| Commodity exchange is an exchange of ''alienable'' objects between people who are in a state of reciprocal ''independence'' that establishes a ''quantitative'' relationship between the ''objects'' exchanged … Gift exchange is an exchange of ''inalienable'' objects between people who are in a state of reciprocal ''dependence'' that establishes a ''qualitative'' relationship between the ''transactors'' (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Chris |title=Gifts and Commodities |year=1982 |publisher=Academic Press |location=London |pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Gregory contrasts gift and commodity exchange according to five criteria:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://haubooks.org/viewbook/gifts-and-commodities/10_ch03 |title=Gifts and Commodities {{!}} Chapter III: Gifts and commodities: Circulation|website=haubooks.org|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other anthropologists, however, refused to see these different "[[Spheres of exchange|exchange spheres]]" as such polar opposites. [[Marilyn Strathern]], writing on a similar area in Papua New Guinea, dismissed the utility of the contrasting setup in "The Gender of the Gift" (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strathern |first=Marilyn |title=The Gender of the Gift: Problems with Women and Problems with Society in Melanesia |year=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |pages=143–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wedding rings.jpg|thumbnail|Wedding rings: commodity or pure gift?]]
Rather than emphasize how particular kinds of objects are either gifts or commodities to be traded in '''restricted''' spheres of exchange, [[Arjun Appadurai]] and others began to look at how objects flowed between these spheres of exchange (i.e. how objects can be converted into gifts and then back into commodities). They refocussed attention away from the character of the human relationships formed through exchange, and placed it on "the social life of things" instead. They examined the strategies by which an object could be "[[Commodity Pathway Diversion|singularized]]" (made unique, special, one-of-a-kind) and so withdrawn from the market. A marriage ceremony that transforms a purchased ring into an irreplaceable family heirloom is one example; the heirloom, in turn, makes a perfect gift. Singularization is the reverse of the seemingly irresistible process of commodification. They thus show how all economies are a constant flow of material objects that enter and leave specific exchange spheres. A similar approach is taken by Nicholas Thomas, who examines the same range of cultures and the anthropologists who write on them, and redirects attention to the "entangled objects" and their roles as both gifts and commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Nicholas |title=Entangled Objects: Exchange, Material Culture, and Colonialism in the Pacific |year=1991 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proscriptions===
Many societies have strong prohibitions against turning gifts into trade or [[Capital (economics)|capital]] goods. Anthropologist Wendy James writes that among the [[Uduk people]] of northeast [[Africa]] there is a strong custom that any gift that crosses subclan boundaries must be consumed rather than invested.&lt;ref name="Lewis Hyde"&gt;''Lewis Hyde: The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property'', pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} For example, an animal given as a gift must be eaten, not bred. However, as in the example of the Trobriand armbands and necklaces, this "perishing" may not consist of consumption as such, but of the gift moving on. In other societies, it is a matter of giving some other gift, either directly in return or to another party. To keep the gift and not give another in exchange is reprehensible. "In folk tales," [[Lewis Hyde]] remarks, "the person who tries to hold onto a gift usually dies."&lt;ref name="Lewis Hyde" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

[[Daniel Everett]], a linguist who studied a small tribe of hunter-gatherers in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Everett |first=Daniel L. |title=Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Pirahã: Another Look at the Design Features of Human Language |journal=Current Anthropology |date=Aug–Oct 2005 |volume=46 |issue=4 |doi=10.1086/431525 |pages=621–646}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that, while they are aware of [[food preservation]] using drying, salting, and so forth, they reserve the use of these techniques for items for barter outside of the tribe. Within the group, when someone has a successful hunt they immediately share the abundance by inviting others to enjoy a feast. Asked about this practice, one hunter laughed and replied, "I store meat in the belly of my brother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Curren |first=Erik |title=Charles Eisenstein wants to devalue your money to save the economy |url=http://transitionvoice.com/2012/08/charles-eisenstein-wants-to-devalue-your-money-to-save-the-economy/ |publisher=Transition Voice |accessdate=9 February 2013 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eisenstein |first=Charles |title=The Ascent of Humanity |url=http://www.ascentofhumanity.com/chapter2-7.php |accessdate=9 February 2013 |authorlink=Charles Eisenstein |chapter=2 |isbn=978-0977622207 |publisher=Pananthea Press |location=Harrisburg, PA |year=2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207030351/http://www.ascentofhumanity.com/chapter2-7.php |archive-date=2013-02-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carol Stack's ''All Our Kin'' describes both the positive and negative sides of a network of obligation and gratitude effectively constituting a gift economy. Her narrative of [[The Flats, Chicago, Illinois|The Flats]], a poor [[Chicago]] neighborhood, tells in passing the story of two sisters who each came into a small inheritance. One sister hoarded the inheritance and prospered materially for some time, but was alienated from the community. Her marriage ultimately broke up, and she integrated herself back into the community largely by giving gifts. The other sister fulfilled the community's expectations, but within six weeks had nothing material to show for the inheritance but a coat and a pair of shoes.&lt;ref name="Lewis Hyde" /&gt;{{rp|75–76}}

== Case studies: Prestations ==

Marcel Mauss was careful to distinguish "gift economies" (reciprocity) in market-based societies from the "total prestations" given in non-market societies. A prestation is a service provided out of a sense of obligation, like "community service".&lt;ref name="Hann, Chris 2011 50" /&gt; These "prestations" bring together domains that we would differentiate as political, religious, legal, moral and economic, such that the exchange can be seen to be [[Embeddedness|embedded]] in non-economic social institutions. These prestations are frequently competitive, as in the [[potlatch]], [[Kula ring|Kula exchange]], and [[Moka exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graeber |first=David |title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value |year=2001 |publisher=Palgrave |location=Basingstoke |page=153 |authorlink=David Graeber |chapter=Marcel Mauss Revisited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moka exchange in Papua New Guinea: competitive exchange ===
{{main|Moka exchange}}
[[File:Papua New Guinea map.png|thumbnail|[[Mount Hagen]], Papua New Guinea.]]
The ''Moka'' is a highly ritualized system of exchange in the [[Mount Hagen]] area, [[Papua New Guinea]], that has become emblematic of the anthropological concepts of "gift economy" and of "[[Big man (anthropology)|big man]]" political system. Moka are reciprocal gifts of pigs through which social status is achieved. Moka refers specifically to the increment in the size of the gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=C.A. |title=Gifts and Commodities |year=1982 |publisher=Academic Press |location=London |pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social status in the "big man" political system is the result of giving larger gifts than one has received. These gifts are of a limited range of goods, primarily pigs and scarce pearl shells from the coast. To return the same amount as one has received in a moka is simply the repayment of a debt, strict reciprocity.  Moka is the extra. To some, this represents interest on an investment. However, one is not bound to provide moka, only to repay the debt. One adds moka to the gift to increase one's prestige, and to place the receiver in debt. It is this constant renewal of the debt relationship which keeps the relationship alive; a debt fully paid off ends further interaction. Giving more than one receives establishes a reputation as a Big man, whereas the simple repayment of debt, or failure to fully repay, pushes one's reputation towards the other end of the scale, "rubbish man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=C.A. |title=Gifts and Commodities |year=1982 |publisher=Academic Press |location=London |pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gift exchange thus has a political effect; granting prestige or status to one, and a sense of debt in the other. A political system can be built out of these kinds of status relationships. Sahlins characterizes the difference between status and rank by highlighting that Big man is not a role; it is a status that is shared by many. The Big man is "not a prince ''of'' men", but a "prince among men". The "big man" system is based upon the ability to persuade, rather than command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sahlins |first=Marshall |title=Poor Man, Rich Man, Big-Man, Chief: Political Types in Melanesia and Polynesia |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |year=1963 |volume=5 |series=3 |pages=294–7 |doi=10.1017/s0010417500001729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Toraja]] are an [[ethnic group]] [[indigenous people|indigenous]] to a mountainous region of [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toraja.go.id/sosial.php |title=Tana Toraja official website |accessdate=2006-10-04 |language=Indonesian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529201932/http://www.toraja.go.id/sosial.php |archivedate=May 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torajans are renowned for their elaborate funeral rites, burial sites carved into rocky cliffs, and massive peaked-roof traditional houses known as ''[[tongkonan]]'' which are owned by noble families. Membership in a tongkonan is inherited by all descendants of its founders. Any individual Toraja may thus be a member of numerous tongkonan, as long as they contribute to its ritual events. Membership in a tongkonan carries benefits, such as the right to rent some of its rice fields.&lt;ref name="Schrauwers8386"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schrauwers |first=Albert |title=H(h)ouses, E(e)states and class; On the importance of capitals in central Sulawesi |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |year=2004 |volume=160 |issue=1 |pages=83–86 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toraja funeral rites are important social events, usually attended by hundreds of people and lasting for several days. The funerals are like "big men" competitions where all the descendants of a tongkonan will compete through gifts of sacrificial cattle. Participants will have invested cattle with others over the years, and will now draw on those extended networks to make the largest gift. The winner of the competition becomes the new owner of the tongkonan and its rice lands. They display all the cattle horns from their winning sacrifice on a pole in front of the tongkonan.&lt;ref name="Schrauwers8386" /&gt;

The Toraja funeral differs from the "big man" system in that the winner of the "gift" exchange gains control of the Tongkonan's property. It creates a clear social hierarchy between the noble owners of the tongkonan and its land, and the commoners who are forced to rent their fields from him. Since the owners of the tongkonan gain rent, they are better able to compete in the funeral gift exchanges, and their social rank is more stable than the "big man" system.&lt;ref name="Schrauwers8386" /&gt;

== Charity and alms giving ==
{{main|Alms}}
Anthropologist [[David Graeber]] has argued that the great world religious traditions on charity and gift giving emerged almost simultaneously during the "[[Axial age]]" (the period between 800 and 200 BCE), which was the same period in which coinage was invented and market economies established on a continental basis. These religious traditions on charity emerge, he argues, as a reaction against the nexus formed by coinage, slavery, military violence and the market (a "military-coinage" complex). The new world religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] all sought to preserve "human economies" where money served to cement social relationships rather than purchase things (including people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graeber |first=David |title=Debt: The first 5,000 years |year=2011 |publisher=Melville House |location=New York |pages=223–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charity and alms-giving are religiously sanctioned voluntary gifts given without expectation of return. Case studies demonstrate, however, that such gift-giving is not necessarily altruistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bowie |first=Katherine |title=The Alchemy of Charity: Of class and Buddhism in Northern Thailand |journal=American Anthropologist |year=1998 |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=469–81 |doi=10.1525/aa.1998.100.2.469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Merit making in Buddhist Thailand ===
[[File:Young monk.jpg|thumb|Young Burmese monk]]
[[Theravada Buddhism]] in [[Thailand]] emphasizes the importance of giving alms ([[merit making]]) without any intention of return (a pure gift), which is best accomplished according to doctrine, through gifts to monks and temples. The emphasis is on the selfless gifting which "earns merit" (and a future better life) for the giver rather than on the relief of the poor or the recipient on whom the gift is bestowed. Bowie's research among poorer Thai farmers shows, however, that this ideal form of gifting is limited to the rich who have the resources to endow temples, or sponsor the ordination of a monk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bowie |first=Katherine |title=The Alchemy of Charity: Of class and Buddhism in Northern Thailand |journal=American Anthropologist |year=1998 |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=473–4 |doi=10.1525/aa.1998.100.2.469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monks come from these same families, hence the doctrine of pure gifting to monks has a class element to it. Poorer farmers place much less emphasis on merit making through gifts to monks and temples. They equally validate gifting to beggars. Poverty and famine is widespread amongst these poorer groups, and by validating gift-giving to beggars, they are in fact demanding that the rich see to their needs in hard times. Bowie sees this as an example of a [[moral economy]] (see below) in which the poor use gossip and reputation as a means of resisting elite exploitation and pressuring them to ease their "this world" suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bowie |first=Katherine |title=The Alchemy of Charity: Of class and Buddhism in Northern Thailand |journal=American Anthropologist |year=1998 |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=475–7 |doi=10.1525/aa.1998.100.2.469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charity: Dana in India ===
[[Dāna]] is a form of religious charity given in Hindu India. The gift is said to embody the sins of the giver (the "poison of the gift"), who it frees of evil by transmitting it to the recipient. The merit of the gift is dependent on finding a worthy recipient such as a [[Brahmin]] priest. Priests are supposed to be able to digest the sin through ritual action and transmit the gift with increment to someone of greater worth. It is imperative that this be a true gift, with no reciprocity, or the evil will return. The gift is not intended to create any relationship between donor and recipient, and there should never be a return gift. Dana thus transgresses the so-called universal "norm of reciprocity".&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 467" /&gt;

=== The Children of Peace in Canada ===
[[File:SharonTemple.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sharon Temple]]
[[The Children of Peace]] (1812–1889) were a utopian Quaker sect. Today, they are primarily remembered for the [[Sharon Temple]], a national historic site and an architectural symbol of their vision of a society based on the values of peace, equality and social justice.  They built this ornate temple to raise money for the poor, and built the province of Ontario's first shelter for the homeless. They took a lead role in the organization of the province's first co-operative, [[Farmers' Storehouse Company|the Farmers' Storehouse]], and opened the province's first credit union. The group soon found that the charity they tried to distribute from their Temple fund endangered the poor. Accepting charity was a sign of indebtedness, and the [[Imprisonment for debt (Upper Canada)|debtor could be jailed without trial at the time]]; this was the "poison of the gift". They thus transformed their charity fund into a credit union that loaned small sums like today's micro-credit institutions. This is an example of [[Commodity pathway diversion|singularization]], as money was transformed into charity in the Temple ceremony, then shifted to an alternative exchange sphere as a loan. Interest on the loan was then singularized, and transformed back into charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schrauwers |first=Albert |title='Union is Strength': W.L. Mackenzie, The Children of Peace and the Emergence of Joint Stock Democracy in Upper Canada |year=2009 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |pages=97–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gifting as non-commodified exchange in market societies==
Non-commodified spheres of exchange exist in relation to the market economy. They are created through the processes of [[Commodity pathway diversion|singularization]] as specific objects are de-commodified for a variety of reasons and enter an alternative [[Spheres of exchange|exchange sphere]]. As in the case of organ donation, this may be the result of an ideological opposition to the "traffic in humans". In other cases, it is in opposition to the market and to its perceived greed. It may, however, be used by corporations as a means of creating a sense of endebtedness and loyalty in customers. Modern marketing techniques often aim at infusing commodity exchange with features of gift exchange, thus blurring the presumably sharp distinction between gifts and commodities.&lt;ref&gt;Rus, Andrej (2008).[http://www.drustvo-antropologov.si/AN/PDF/2008_1/Anthropological_Notebooks_XIV_1_Rus.pdf "'Gift vs. commoditiy' debate revisited".

=== Organ transplant networks, sperm and blood banks ===
[[File:"YOUR BLOOD CAN SAVE HIM" - NARA - 516245.tif|thumbnail|Blood donation poster, WWII.]]
{{main|Organ gifting}}
Market economies tend to reduce everything – "including human beings, their labor, and their reproductive capacity"{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} – to the status of commodities. The rapid transfer of organ transplant technology to the third world has created a trade in organs, with sick bodies travelling to the global south for transplants, and healthy organs from the global south being transported to the richer global north, "creating a kind of 'Kula ring' of bodies and body parts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schepper-Hughes |first=Nancy |title=The Global Traffic in Human Organs |journal=Current Anthropology |year=2000 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=193 |doi=10.1086/300123}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all commodities can also be singularized, or de-commodified, and transformed into gifts. In North America, it is illegal to sell organs, and citizens are enjoined to give the "gift of life" and donate their organs in an organ gift economy.&lt;ref name="Schepper-Hughes 2000 191–224"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schepper-Hughes |first=Nancy |title=The Global Traffic in Human Organs |journal=Current Anthropology |year=2000 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=191–224 |doi=10.1086/300123}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this gift economy is a "medical realm rife with potent forms of mystified commodification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sharp |first=Lesley A. |title=The Commodification of the Body and its Parts |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |year=2000 |volume=29 |page=303 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.29.1.287}}&lt;/ref&gt; This multimillion-dollar medical industry requires clients to pay steep fees for the gifted organ, which creates clear class divisions between those who donate (frequently in the global south) and will never benefit from gifted organs, and those who can pay the fees and thereby receive the gifted organ.&lt;ref name="Schepper-Hughes 2000 191–224" /&gt;

Unlike body organs, blood and semen have been successfully and legally commodified in the United States. Blood and semen can thus be commodified, but once consumed are "the gift of life". Although both can be either donated or sold, are perceived as the "gift of life" yet are stored in "banks", and can be collected only under strict government regulated procedures, recipients very clearly prefer altruistically donated semen and blood. Ironically, the blood and semen samples with the highest market value are those that have been altruistically donated. The recipients view semen as storing the potential characteristics of their unborn child in its DNA, and value altruism over greed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tober |first=Diane M. |title=Semen as Gift, Semen as Goods: Reproductive Workers and the Market in Altruism |journal=Body &amp; Society |year=2001 |volume=7 |issue=2-3 |pages=137–60 |doi=10.1177/1357034x0100700205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, gifted blood is the archetype of a pure gift relationship because the donor is only motivated by a desire to help others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Titmuss |first=Richard |title=The Gift Relationship: From human blood to social policy |year=1997 |publisher=The New Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Copyleft vs copyright: the gift of "free" speech ===
{{main|Copyleft}}
Engineers, scientists and software developers have created [[free software]] projects such as the [[Linux kernel]] and the [[GNU]] operating system. They are prototypical examples for the gift economy's prominence in the technology sector, and its active role in instating the use of [[Permissive free software licence|permissive free software]] and [[copyleft]] licenses, which allow free reuse of software and knowledge. Other examples include [[file-sharing]], [[open access]], [[Unlicense|unlicense]]d software ... etc.

=== Points: Loyalty programs ===
{{main|Loyalty program}}
Many retail organizations have "gift" programs meant to encourage customer loyalty to their establishments. Bird-David and Darr refer to these as hybrid "mass-gifts" which are neither gift nor commodity. They are called mass-gifts because they are given away in large numbers "free with purchase" in a mass-consumption environment. They give as an example two bars of soap in which one is given free with purchase: which is the commodity and which the gift? The mass-gift both affirms the distinct difference between gift and commodity while confusing it at the same time. As with gifting, mass-gifts are used to create a social relationship. Some customers embrace the relationship and gift whereas others reject the gift relationship and interpret the "gift" as a 50% off sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bird-David |first=Nurit |author2=Darr, Asaf |title=Commodity, gift and mass-gift: on gift-commodity hybrids in advanced mass consumption cultures |journal=Economy and Society |year=2009 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=304–25 |doi=10.1080/03085140902786777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free shops ===
{{main|Give-away shop}}
[[File:Give away shop utrecht inside.jpg|right|thumb|Inside [[Utrecht]] Giveaway shop. The banner reads "The earth has enough for everyone's need, but not for everyone's greed".]]
"[[Give-away shops]]", "freeshops" or "free stores" are stores where all goods are free. They are similar to [[charity shop]]s, with mostly second-hand items—only everything is available at no cost. Whether it is a [[book]], a piece of [[furniture]], a garment or a [[household]] item, it is all freely given away, although some operate a one-in, one-out–type policy (swap shops). The free store is a form of constructive [[direct action]] that provides a shopping alternative to a [[monetary]] framework, allowing people to exchange goods and services outside of a money-based economy. The anarchist [[1960s counterculture|1960s countercultural]] group [[Diggers (theatre)|The Diggers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=John Campbell McMillian |author2=Paul Buhle |title=The new left revisited |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_Ohks41z2IC&amp;pg=PA112 |accessdate=28 December 2011 |year=2003 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-976-0 |pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened [[free stores]] which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.&lt;ref name="Lytle_2006_213215"&gt;{{harvnb|Lytle|2006|pp=213, 215}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Diggers took their name from the original [[Diggers|English Diggers]] led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]]&lt;ref name="Digger Archives"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diggers.org/overview.htm |title=Overview: who were (are) the Diggers? |accessdate=2007-06-17 |work=The Digger Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to create a mini-society free of money and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="American Experience doc"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Gail Dolgin]]; Vicente Franco |date=2007 |title=American Experience: The Summer of Love |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/love/index.html |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2007-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although free stores have not been uncommon in the United States since the 1960s, the [[freegan]] movement has inspired the establishment of more free stores. Today the idea is kept alive by the new generations of [[social centres]], anarchists and environmentalists who view the idea as an intriguing way to raise awareness about [[consumer culture]] and to promote the [[reuse]] of commodities.

===Mutual aid===
[[File:La conquête du pain.jpg|right|thumb|''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' by Peter Kropotkin, influential work which presents the economic vision of [[anarcho-communism]].]]
Many anarchists, particularly [[anarcho-primitivists]] and [[anarcho-communists]], believe that variations on a gift economy may be the key to breaking the [[cycle of poverty]]. Therefore, they often desire to refashion all of society into a gift economy. Anarcho-communists advocate a gift economy as an ideal, with neither money, nor markets, nor central planning. This view traces back at least to [[Peter Kropotkin]], who saw in the hunter-gatherer tribes he had visited the paradigm of "[[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1955 paperback (reprinted 2005), includes Kropotkin's 1914 preface, Foreword and Bibliography by Ashley Montagu, and The Struggle for Existence, by Thomas H. Huxley ed.). Boston: Extending Horizons Books, Porter Sargent Publishers. {{ISBN|0-87558-024-6}}. Project Gutenberg e-text, Project LibriVox audiobook&lt;/ref&gt; In place of a market, [[anarcho-communists]], such as those who inhabited some Spanish villages in the 1930s, support a currency-less gift economy where goods and services are produced by workers and distributed in community stores where everyone (including the workers who produced them) is essentially entitled to consume whatever they want or need as payment for their production of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;[Augustin Souchy, "A Journey Through Aragon," in [[Sam Dolgoff]] (ed.), [[The Anarchist Collectives]], ch. 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

As an intellectual abstraction, mutual aid was developed and advanced by [[mutualism (movement)|mutualism]] or labor [[insurance]] systems and thus [[trade union]]s, and has been also used in [[cooperatives]] and other [[civil society]] movements. Typically, mutual-aid groups will be free to join and participate in, and all activities will be [[Voluntariness|voluntary]]. They are often structured as [[Non-hierarchical Organization|non-hierarchical]], [[Bureaucracy|non-bureaucratic]] [[non-profit organizations]], with members controlling all resources and no external financial or professional support. They are member-led and member-organized. They are egalitarian in nature, and designed to support [[participatory democracy]], [[Social equality|equality]] of member status and power, and shared [[leadership]] and [[Consensus decision-making|cooperative decision-making]]. Members' external societal status is considered irrelevant inside the group: status in the group is conferred by participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Francis J. |title=Canadian encyclopedia of social work |year=2005 |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |location=Waterloo, Ont. |isbn=0889204365 |pages=337–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral economy===
English historian [[E.P. Thompson]] wrote of the [[moral economy]] of the poor in the context of widespread English food riots in the English countryside in the late eighteenth century. According to Thompson these riots were generally peaceable acts that demonstrated a common political culture rooted in feudal rights to "set the price" of essential goods in the market. These peasants held that a traditional "fair price" was more important to the community than a "free" market price and they punished large farmers who sold their surpluses at higher prices outside the village while there were still those in need within the village. A moral economy is thus an attempt to preserve an alternative exchange sphere from market penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Edward P. |title=Customs in Common |year=1991 |publisher=New Press |location=New York |pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Edward P. |title=Customs in Common |year=1991 |publisher=New Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of peasants with a non-capitalist cultural mentality using the market for their own ends has been linked to subsistence agriculture and the need for subsistence insurance in hard times. James C. Scott points out, however, that those who provide this subsistence insurance to the poor in bad years are wealthy patrons who exact a political cost for their aid; this aid is given to recruit followers. The concept of moral economy has been used to explain why peasants in a number of colonial contexts, such as the Vietnam War, have rebelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=James C. |title=The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and subsistence in Southeast Asia |year=1976 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The commons===
{{main|Commons}}

Some may confuse common property regimes with gift exchange systems. "Commons" refers to the cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of a society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable earth. These resources are held in common, not owned privately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bollier |first=David |authorlink=David Bollier |year=2002 |title=Reclaiming the commons |journal=Boston Review |url=http://bostonreview.net/BR27.3/bollier.html |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resources held in common can include everything from [[natural resource]]s and [[common land]] to [[software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berry |first=David |date=21 February 2005 |title=The commons |journal=[[Free Software Magazine]] |url=http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/commons_as_ideas |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commons contains [[public property]] and [[private property]], over which people have certain traditional rights. When commonly held property is transformed into private property this process alternatively is termed "[[enclosure]]" or more commonly, "privatization". A person who has a right in, or over, common land jointly with another or others is called a commoner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/commoner |title=Commoner |last=Anon |publisher=Farlex Inc |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of important aspects that can be used to describe true commons. The first is that the commons cannot be [[commodified]] – if they are, they cease to be commons. The second aspect is that unlike private property, the commons are inclusive rather than exclusive – their nature is to share ownership as widely, rather than as narrowly, as possible. The third aspect is that the assets in commons are meant to be preserved regardless of their [[return of capital]]. Just as we receive them as a shared right, so we have a duty to pass them on to future generations in at least the same condition as we received them. If we can add to their value, so much the better, but at a minimum we must not degrade them, and we certainly have no right to destroy them.&lt;ref name="Capitalism3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnes |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Barnes (entrepreneur) |title=Capitalism 3.0: A Guide to Reclaiming the Commons |publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers |series= |year=2006 |doi= |isbn=978-1-57675-361-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although different definitions are used, free content is legally similar if not identical to [[open content]]. An analogy is the use of the rival terms [[alternative terms for free software|free software and open source]] which describe ideological differences rather than legal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html |title=Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software |last=Stallman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Stallman |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free content encompasses all works in the [[public domain]] and also those [[copyright]]ed works whose [[license]]s honor and uphold the freedoms mentioned above. Because copyright law in most countries by default grants copyright holders [[monopoly|monopolistic control]] over their creations, copyright content must be explicitly declared free, usually by the referencing or inclusion of licensing statements from within the work.

Though a work which is in the public domain because its copyright has expired is considered free, it can become non-free again if the copyright law changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080716-eu-caves-to-aging-rockers-wants-45-year-copyright-extension.html |title=EU caves to aging rockers, wants 45-year copyright extension |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |last=Anderson |first=Nate |date=July 16, 2008 |accessdate=August 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information is particularly suited to gift economies, as information is a [[nonrival good]] and can be gifted at practically no cost (zero [[marginal cost]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mackaay |first=Ejan |title=Economic Incentives in Markets for Information and Innovation |journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy |year=1990 |volume=13 |issue=909 |pages=867–910}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heylighen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Heylighen |first=Francis |authorlink=Francis Heylighen |editor=B.

====Filesharing====
[[Markus Giesler]] in his [[ethnography]] ''Consumer Gift System'', described music downloading as a system of social solidarity based on gift transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Giesler, [http://sonner.antville.org/files/giesler+-+napster+gift/ Consumer Gift Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Internet]] access spread, file sharing became extremely popular among users who could contribute and receive files on line. This form of gift economy was a model for online services such as [[Napster]], which focused on music sharing and was later sued for [[copyright infringement]]. Nonetheless, online file sharing persists in various forms such as [[Bit Torrent]] and [[Direct download link]].  A number of communications and intellectual property experts such as [[Henry Jenkins]] and [[Lawrence Lessig]] have described file-sharing as a form of gift exchange which provides numerous benefits to artists and consumers alike. They have argued that file sharing fosters community among distributors and allows for a more equitable distribution of media.

====Free and open-source software====
In his essay "[[Homesteading the Noosphere]]", noted [[computer programmer]] [[Eric S. Raymond]] said that [[free and open-source software]] developers have created "a 'gift culture' in which participants compete for prestige by giving time, energy, and creativity away".&lt;ref&gt;http://catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/&lt;/ref&gt; Prestige gained as a result of contributions to source code fosters a social network for the developer; the [[free software movement|open source community]] will recognize the developer's accomplishments and intelligence. Consequently, the developer may find more opportunities to work with other developers. However, prestige is not the only motivator for the giving of lines of code. An anthropological study of the [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] community, as part of a [[Master's degree|master's]] study at the University of North Texas in 2010-11, found that common reasons given by contributors were "learning for the joy of learning and collaborating with interesting and smart people". Motivation for personal gain, such as career benefits, was more rarely reported. Many of those surveyed said things like, "Mainly I contribute just to make it work for me", and "programmers develop software to 'scratch an itch{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Suehle |first=Ruth |title=An anthropologist's view of an open source community |url=http://opensource.com/life/11/1/anthropologists-view-open-source-community |publisher=opensource.com |accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Institute of Infonomics at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands reported in 2002 that in addition to the above, large corporations, and they specifically mentioned [[IBM]], also spend large annual sums employing developers specifically for them to contribute to open source projects. The firms' and the employees' motivations in such cases are less clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Free/Libre and Open Source Software:  Survey and Study |url=http://flossproject.org/report/Final0.htm |publisher=International Institute of Infonomics, University of Maastricht and Berlecon Research GmbH |year=2002 |accessdate=19 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821233230/http://flossproject.org/report/Final0.htm |archivedate=21 August 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Linux]] community often speak of their community as a gift economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Matzan |first=Jem |title=The gift economy and free software |url=http://archive09.linux.com/feature/36554 |date=5 June 2004 |accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IT research firm IDC valued the Linux kernel at $18 billion USD in 2007 and projected its value at $40 billion USD in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cioupdate.com/news/article.php/3660141/IDC-Linux-Ecosystem-Worth-40-Billion-by-2010.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Debian]] [[Linux distribution|distribution]] of the [[GNU]]/Linux operating system offers over 37,000 free open-source software packages via their AMD64 repositories alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch02.en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collaborative works====
Collaborative works are works created by an open community. For example, [[Wikipedia]]{{spaced ndash}}a free online encyclopedia{{spaced ndash}}features millions of articles developed collaboratively, and almost none of its many authors and editors receive any direct material reward.&lt;ref&gt;D. Anthony, S. W. Smith, and T. Williamson, "[http://web.mit.edu/iandeseminar/Papers/Fall2005/anthony.pdf Explaining quality in internet collective goods: zealots and good samaritans in the case of ''Wikipedia'']", THanover : Dartmouth College, Technical Report, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/reports/TR2007-606.pdf |title=The Quality of Open Source Production: Zealots and Good Samaritans in the Case of ''Wikipedia'' |first1=Denise |last1=Anthony |first2=Sean W. |last2=Smith |first3=Tim |last3=Williamson |journal=Technical Report TR2007-606 |publisher=Dartmouth College |date=April 2007 |accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a gift economy has played a large role in works of fiction about alternative societies, especially in works of [[science fiction]]. Examples include:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' (1890) by [[William Morris]] is a utopian novel about a society which operates on a gift economy.
* ''[[The Great Explosion]]'' (1962) by [[Eric Frank Russell]] describes the encounter of a military survey ship and a [[Gandhi]]an pacifist society that operates as a gift economy.
* ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' (1974) by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] is a novel about a gift economy society that had exiled themselves from their ([[capitalism|capitalist]]) homeplanet.
* The [[Mars trilogy]], a series of books written by [[Kim Stanley Robinson]] in the 1990s, suggests that new human societies that develop away from [[Earth]] could migrate toward a gift economy.
* The movie ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]'' (2000) centers on a schoolboy who, for a school project, comes up with the idea of doing a good deed for another and then asking the recipient to "pay it forward". Although the phrase "gift economy" is never explicitly mentioned, the scheme would, in effect, create one.
* ''[[Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom]]'' (2003) by [[Cory Doctorow]] describes future society where rejuvenation and body-enhancement have made death obsolete, and material goods are no longer scarce, resulting in a [[reputation]]-based ([[whuffie]]) economic system.
* ''[[Wizard's Holiday]]'' (2003) by [[Diane Duane]] describes two young wizards visiting a utopian-like planet whose economy is based on gift-giving and mutual support.
* ''[[Voyage from Yesteryear]]'' (1982) by [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]] describes a society of the [[Embryo space colonization|embryo colonists]] of [[Alpha Centauri]] who have a post-scarcity gift economy.
* ''Cradle of Saturn'' (1999) and its sequel ''The Anguished Dawn'' (2003) by James P. Hogan describe a colonization effort on [[Saturn]]'s largest satellite. Both describe the challenges involved in adopting a new economic paradigm.
* [[Science fiction]] author [[Bruce Sterling]] wrote a story, ''Maneki-neko'', in which the cat-paw gesture is the sign of a secret AI-based gift economy.

A '''habit''' (or '''wont''') is a routine of [[behavior]] that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Gillian; Hope, Tony. ''Managing Your Mind: The mental fitness guide''. Oxford Paperbacks, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habit Definition of ''Habit''].

''Merriam Webster Dictionary''. Retrieved on August 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]'' (1903) defines a "habit, from the standpoint of psychology, [as] a more or less fixed  way of thinking,  willing,  or feeling acquired through previous repetition of a mental experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Habitual behavior often goes unnoticed in persons exhibiting it, because a person does not need to engage in self-analysis when undertaking routine tasks.  Habits are sometimes compulsory.&lt;ref name="MerriamWebster1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalbehavioronline.com/habituation.html "Habituation."] Animalbehavioronline.com. Retrieved on August 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; New behaviours can become automatic through the process of '''habit formation'''. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns which humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Rosenthal|first= Norman|title= Habit Formation|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/habit-formation|publisher= Sussex Directories|accessdate= November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/habit-formation|title= Habit Formation|work= psychologytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the [[automaticity]] of the behavior in that context.&lt;ref name="g2007_Wood_Neal"&gt;{{cite journal

== Formation ==
Habit formation is the process by which a behavior, through regular repetition, becomes automatic or habitual. This is modelled as an increase in automaticity with number of repetitions up to an [[asymptote]].&lt;ref&gt;Hull, C. L. (1943). ''Principles of behavior: An introduction to behavior theory.'' New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hull, C. L. (1951). ''Essentials of behavior.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lally"&gt;Lally, P., van Jaarsveld, C. H. M., Potts, H. W. W., &amp; Wardle, J. (2010). How are habits formed: Modelling habit formation in the real world. ''European Journal of Social Psychology''. October 2010. '''40'''(6), 998–1009. {{DOI|10.1002/ejsp.674}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process of habit formation can be slow. Lally ''et al.'' (2010) found the average time for participants to reach the asymptote of automaticity was 66 days with a range of 18–254 days.&lt;ref name="Lally" /&gt;

As the habit is forming, it can be analysed in three parts: the cue, the behavior, and the reward. The cue is the thing that causes the habit to come about, the trigger of the habitual behavior. This could be anything that one's mind associates with that habit and one will automatically let a habit come to the surface. The behavior is the actual habit that one exhibits, and the reward, a positive feeling, therefore continues the "habit loop".&lt;ref&gt;Duhigg, C. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.npr.org/2012/03/05/147192599/habits-how-they-form-and-how-to-break-them&lt;/ref&gt; A habit may initially be triggered by a goal, but over time that goal becomes less necessary and the habit becomes more automatic.

A variety of digital tools, online or mobile apps, have been introduced that are designed to support habit formation. For example, Habitica is a system that uses [[gamification]], implementing strategies found in video games to real life tasks by adding rewards such as experience and gold.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, Sebastian, et al. "Gamification. using game-design elements in non-gaming contexts." CHI'11 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A review of such tools, however, suggests most are poorly designed with respect to theory and fail to support the development of automaticity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2556288.2557079 Stawarz, K., Cox, A. L., &amp; Blandford, A. (2014)]. Don't forget your pill!: Designing effective medication reminder apps that support users' daily routines.

New York: ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shopping habits are particularly vulnerable to change at "major life moments" like graduation, marriage, birth of first child, moving to a new home, and divorce.  Some stores use purchase data to try to detect these events and take advantage of the marketing opportunity.&lt;ref name="think"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kera.org/2012/03/14/habits-life-and-business/|title=Habits, Life, and Business - Think|website=www.kera.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some habits are known as "keystone habits", and these influence the formation of other habits.  For example, identifying as the type of person who takes care of their body and is in the habit of exercising regularly, can also influence eating better and using credit cards less.  In business, safety can be a keystone habit that influences other habits that result in greater productivity.&lt;ref name="think" /&gt;

A recent study by Adriaanse et al. (2014) found that habits mediate the relationship between self-control and unhealthy snack consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adriaanse|first=Marieke A.|last2=Kroese|first2=Floor M.|last3=Gillebaart|first3=Marleen|last4=Ridder|first4=De|last5=D|first5=Denise T.|date=2014|title=Effortless inhibition: habit mediates the relation between self-control and unhealthy snack consumption|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00444/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00444|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the study empirically demonstrate that high-self control may influence the formation of habits and in turn affect behavior. 

== Goals ==
The habit–goal interface or interaction is constrained by the particular manner in which habits are learned and represented in memory. Specifically, the associative learning underlying habits is characterized by the slow, incremental accrual of information over time in procedural memory.&lt;ref name="g2007_Wood_Neal" /&gt; Habits can either benefit or hurt the goals a person sets for themselves.

Goals guide habits by providing the initial outcome-oriented motivation for response repetition. In this sense, habits are often a trace of past goal pursuit.&lt;ref name="g2007_Wood_Neal" /&gt; Although, when a habit forces one action, but a conscious goal pushes for another action, an oppositional context occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner. "''Psychology Second Edition''" (2011). New York: Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; When the habit prevails over the conscious goal, a capture error has taken place.

Behavior prediction is also derived from goals. Behavior prediction is to acknowledge the likelihood that a habit will form, but in order to form that habit, a goal must have been initially present. The influence of goals on habits is what makes a habit different from other automatic processes in the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, D., Wood, W., Labrecque, J., &amp; Lally, P. (2011). How do habits guide behavior? perceived and actual triggers of habits in daily life . Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, (48), 492-498. Retrieved from http://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/545/docs/Wendy_Wood_Research_Articles/Habits/neal.wood.labrecque.lally.2012_001_How_do_habits_guide_behavior.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a description of a classic goal devaluation experiment (from a Scientific American MIND guest blog post called [http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/mind-guest-blog/2013/11/12/should-habits-or-goals-direct-your-life-it-depends-2/ Should Habits or Goals Direct Your Life? It Depends]) which demonstrates the difference between goal-directed and habitual behavior: &lt;blockquote&gt;A series of elegant experiments&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Dickinson (1985). Actions and Habits: The Development of Behavioural Autonomy. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, volume 308, pages 67—78. http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/308/1135/67&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by Anthony Dickinson and colleagues in the early 1980s at the University of Cambridge in England clearly exposes the behavioral differences between goal-directed and habitual processes. Basically, in the training phase, a rat was trained to press a lever in order to receive some food. Then, in a second phase, the rat was placed in a different cage without a lever and was given the food, but it was made ill whenever it ate the food. This caused the rat to "devalue" the food, because it associated the food with being ill, without directly associating the action of pressing the lever with being ill. Finally, in the test phase, the rat was placed in the original cage with the lever. (To prevent additional learning, no food was delivered in the test phase.) Rats that had undergone an extensive training phase continued to press the lever in the test phase even though the food was devalued; their behavior was called habitual. Rats that had undergone a moderate training phase did not, and their behavior was called goal-directed. …  [G]oal-directed behavior is explained by the rat using an explicit prediction of the consequence, or outcome, of an action to select that action. If the rat wants the food, it presses the lever, because it predicts that pressing the lever will deliver the food. If the food has been devalued, the rat will not press the lever. Habitual behavior is explained by a strong association between an action and the situation from which the action was executed. The rat presses the lever when it sees the lever, not because of the predicted outcome.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Nervousness ==
There are a number of habits possessed by individuals that can be classified as nervous habits. These include nail-biting, stammering, sniffling, and banging the head. They are known as symptoms of an emotional state and are generally based upon conditions of anxiety, insecurity, inferiority and tension. These habits are often formed at a young age and may be because of a need for attention. When trying to overcome a nervous habit it is important to resolve the cause of the nervous feeling rather than the symptom which is a habit itself or as a result one could experience anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/00966347/v25i0004/324_tponh&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety is a disorder known for excessive and unexpected worry that negatively impacts an individuals daily life, and routines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cmha.ca/mental-health/understanding-mental-illness/anxiety-disorders|title=Anxiety Disorders - CMHA National|work=CMHA National|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bad habits ==
A [[bad habit]] is an undesirable behavior pattern. Common examples include: [[procrastination]], [[fidgeting]], [[overspending]], and [[nail-biting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Breaking Bad Habits |author=Suzanne LeVert, Gary R. McClain |year=2001 |isbn=0-02-863986-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QYynTz-w-LQC |publisher=Alpha Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sooner one recognizes these bad habits, the easier it is to fix them.&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, KatharineTHE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NURSING, V. 19 (7), 04/1919, p. 503-506&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than merely attempting to eliminate a bad habit, it may be more productive to seek to replace it with a healthier coping mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jamesclear.com/how-to-break-a-bad-habit|title=How to Break a Bad Habit (and Replace It With a Good One)|date=2013-05-13|work=James Clear|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Will and intention ===
A key factor in distinguishing a bad habit from an [[behavioral addiction|addiction]] or [[mental disease]] is [[self control|willpower]]. If a person can easily control over the behavior, then it is a habit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Diseases of the Will: Alcohol and the Dilemmas of Freedom |author=Mariana Valverde |year=1998 |isbn=0-521-64469-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kl5ugmvDgH0C |chapter=Disease or Habit? Alcoholism and the Exercise of Freedom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good intentions can override the negative effect of bad habits, but their effect seems to be independent and additive—the bad habits remain, but are subdued rather than cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0992(199908/09)29:5/6&lt;591::AID-EJSP948&gt;3.0.CO;2-H |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/62002770/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |title=Good intentions, bad habits, and effects of forming implementation intentions on healthy eating |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=29 |issue=5–6 |pages=591–604 |date=21 Jun 1999 |author=Bas Verplanken, Suzanne Faes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elimination ===

Many techniques exist for removing established bad habits, e.g., ''withdrawal of reinforcers''—identifying and removing factors that trigger and reinforce the habit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=0-440-15413-8 |title=Don't Say Yes When You Want to Say No |author=Herbert Fensterheim, Jean Baer |year=1975 |publisher=Dell |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Aog4MHedR-kC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[basal ganglia]] appears to remember the context that triggers a habit, so habits can be revived if triggers reappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/MIT-explains-why-bad-habits-are-hard-to-break/2100-11395_3-5902850.html|title=MIT explains why bad habits are hard to break|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing and eliminating bad habits as soon as possible is advised. Habit elimination becomes more difficult with age because repetitions reinforce habits cumulatively over the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, Katharine, The Psychology of Habit http://simplelink.library.utoronto.ca/url.cfm/350245 {{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Charles Duhigg]], there is a loop that includes a cue, routine and reward for every habit. An example of a habit loop is TV program ends (cue), go to the fridge (routine), eat a snack (reward). The key to changing habits is to identify your cue and modify your routine and reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/|title=How Habits Work|work=charlesduhigg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=June 2011}}

'''Indeterminism''' is the idea that [[wikt:event|events]] (or certain events, or events of certain types) are not [[causality|caused]], or not caused [[determinism|deterministically]].

It is the opposite of [[determinism]] and related to '''chance'''. It is highly relevant to the philosophical problem of [[free will]], particularly in the form of [[metaphysical libertarianism]]. In science, most specifically quantum theory in physics, indeterminism is the belief that no event is certain and the entire outcome of anything is [[probability|probabilistic]]. The Heisenberg uncertainty relations and the "[[Born rule]]", proposed by [[Max Born]], are often starting points in support of the indeterministic nature of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;The Born rule itself does not imply whether the observed indeterminism is due to the object, to the measurement system, or both. The [[ensemble interpretation]] by Born does not require fundamental indeterminism and lack of causality.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeterminism is also asserted by   [[Sir Arthur Eddington#Indeterminism|Sir Arthur Eddington]], and [[Murray Gell-Mann]]. Indeterminism has been promoted by the French biologist [[Jacques Monod]]'s essay "''[[Chance and Necessity]]''".
The physicist-chemist [[Ilya Prigogine]] argued for indeterminism in [[complex systems]].

==Necessary but insufficient causation==

{{further information|Necessary and sufficient conditions}}
Indeterminists do not have to deny that causes exist. Instead, they  can maintain that the only causes that exist are of a type that do not constrain the future to a single course; for instance, they can maintain that only necessary and not sufficient causes exist. The necessary/sufficient distinction works as follows:

If ''x'' is a necessary cause of ''y''; then the presence of ''y'' necessarily implies that ''x'' preceded it.  The presence of ''x'', however, does not imply that ''y'' will occur.

If ''x'' is a sufficient cause of ''y'', then the presence of ''x'' necessarily implies the presence of ''y''. (However, another cause ''z'' may alternatively cause ''y''. Thus the presence of ''y'' does not imply the presence of ''x''.)

As [[Daniel Dennett]] points out in ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', it is possible for everything to have a [[necessary cause]], even while indeterminism holds and the future is open, because a necessary condition does not lead to a single inevitable effect. Thus "everything has a cause" is, in his opinion, not a clear statement of determinism. Still, a question might arise why this and not that effect occurred: as long as a cause (something in the past) determines the answer to the question "effect A or B" (or ''why'' A or B), determinism will hold. On this basis "everything has a cause" might still be understood as an expression of determinism.

==Probabilistic causation==

{{main article|Probabilistic causation}}

Interpreting [[causality|causation]] as a [[Causal determinism|deterministic]] relation means that if ''A'' causes ''B'', then ''A'' must always be followed by ''B''. In this sense, war does not cause deaths, nor does [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] cause [[cancer]]. As a result, many turn to a notion of probabilistic causation.  Informally, ''A'' probabilistically causes ''B'' if ''A'''s occurrence increases the probability of ''B''.  This is sometimes interpreted to reflect the imperfect knowledge of a deterministic system  but other times interpreted to mean that the causal system under study has an inherently [[indeterministic]]  nature. ([[Propensity probability]] is an analogous idea, according to which probabilities have an objective existence and are not just limitations in a subject's knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/probability-interpret/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: ''Interpretations of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be proved that realizations of any [[probability distribution]] other than the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] one are mathematically equal to applying a (deterministic) function (namely, an [[inverse distribution function]]) on a random variable following the latter (i.e. an "absolutely random" one&lt;ref&gt;The uniform distribution is the most "agnostic" distribution, representing lack of any information. [[Laplace]] in his theory of probability was apparently the first one to notice this. Currently, it can be shown using definitions of [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].&lt;/ref&gt;); the probabilities are contained in the deterministic element. A simple form of demonstrating it would be shooting randomly within a square and then (deterministically) interpreting a relatively large subsquare as the more probable outcome.

==Intrinsic indeterminism versus unpredictability==

A distinction is generally made between indeterminism and the mere inability to measure the variables (limits of precision). This is especially the case for physical indeterminism (as proposed by various [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]). Yet some philosophers have argued that indeterminism and unpredictability are synonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Popper, K| title=Of Clouds and Clocks: an approach to the rationality and the freedom of man, included in Objective Knowledge|year=1972|page=220|publisher=Oxford Clarendon Press|quote=Indeterminism—or, more precisely physical indeterminism—is merely the doctrine that not all events in the physical world are predetermined with absolute precision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
One of the important philosophical implications of determinism is that, according to [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]], it undermines many versions of [[free will]]. Correspondingly, [[libertarianism (metaphysics)|believers in free will]]
often appeal to physical indeterminism. (See [[compatibilism]] for a third option.)

===Aristotle===
The first major philosopher to argue convincingly for some indeterminism was probably [[Aristotle]]. He described four possible causes (material, efficient, formal, and final). Aristotle's word for these causes was αἰτίαι (''aitiai'', as in ''[[wikt:aetiology|aetiology]]''), which translates as causes in the sense of the multiple factors responsible for an event. Aristotle did not subscribe to the simplistic "every event has a (single) cause" idea that was to come later.

In his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Aristotle said there were [[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]] (συμβεβηκός, ''[[sumbebekos]]'') caused by nothing but chance (τύχη, ''tukhe''). He noted that he and the early physicists found no place for chance among their causes.

{{quote|We have seen how far Aristotle distances himself from any view which makes chance a crucial factor in the general explanation of things. And he does so on conceptual grounds: chance events are, he thinks, by definition unusual and lacking certain explanatory features: as such they form the complement class to those things which can be given full natural explanations.&lt;ref name="Hankinson"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Causes |title=Blackwell Companion to Aristotle |last=Hankinson |first=R.J. |year=2009 |page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;|R.J. Hankinson |"Causes" in ''Blackwell Companion to Aristotle ''}}

Aristotle opposed his accidental chance to necessity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Nor is there any definite cause for an accident, but only chance (τυχόν), namely an indefinite (ἀόριστον) cause.
    &lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book V, 1025a25&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    It is obvious that there are principles and causes which are generable and destructible apart from the actual processes of generation and destruction; for if this is not true, everything will be of necessity: that is, if there must necessarily be some cause, other than accidental, of that which is generated and destroyed. Will this be, or not? Yes, if this happens; otherwise not.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book VI, 1027a29-33&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Epicurus===

One generation after Aristotle, [[Epicurus]] argued that as atoms moved through the void, there were occasions when they would "swerve" (''[[clinamen]]'') from their otherwise determined paths, thus initiating new causal chains. Epicurus argued that these swerves would allow us to be more responsible for our actions, something impossible if every action was deterministically caused. For Epicurus, the occasional interventions of arbitrary gods would be preferable to strict determinism.

===Leucippus===
The first concept of ''chance'' is found in the [[Atomism]] of [[Leucippus]], often confused with that of [[Democritus]], though, in fact, the last studies show many differences between the two. The first assertion about chance is the Leucippus fragment that says:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "ὁ τοίνυν κόσμος συνέστη περικεκλασμένῳ σχήματι ἐσχηματισμένος τὸν τρόπον τοῦτον. τῶν ἀτόμων σωμάτων ἀπρονόητον καὶ τυχαίαν ἐχόντων τὴν κίνησιν συνεχῶς τε καὶ τάχιστα κινουμένων"
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;"The cosmos, then, became like a spherical form in this way: the atoms being submitted to a casual and unpredictable movement, quickly and incessantly".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermann Alexander Diels|H.Diels-W.Kranz]] ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', Berlin Weidmann 1952, 24, I, 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early modern philosophy===
In 1729 the''Testament'' of [[Jean Meslier]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The matter, by virtue of its own active force, moves and acts in blind manner".&lt;ref&gt;Meslier, J. ''The Testament''.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soon after [[Julien Offroy de la Mettrie]] in his ''L'Homme Machine.'' (1748, anon.) wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Perhaps, the cause of man's existence is just in existence itself? Perhaps he is by chance thrown in some point of this terrestrial surface without any ''how'' and ''why''". &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his ''Anti-Sénèque'' [''Traité de la vie heureuse, par Sénèque, avec un Discours du traducteur sur le même sujet'', 1750] we read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Then, the chance has thrown us in life".&lt;ref&gt;Jde La Mettrie, J.O.:''Anti-Sénèque''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 19th century the French Philosopher [[Antoine-Augustin Cournot]] theorized ''chance'' in a new way, as series of not-linear causes. He wrote in ''Essai sur les fondements de nos connaissances'' (1851):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is not because of rarity that the chance is actual. On the contrary, it is because of chance they produce many possible others."&lt;ref&gt;Cournot, A.A: ''Essai sur les fondements de nos connaissances et sur les caractères de la critique philosophique'', § 32.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Charles Peirce===
[[Tychism]] ({{lang-el|τύχη}} "chance") is a thesis proposed by the American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S.:  ''The Doctrine of Necessity Examined'', [[The Monist]], 1892
&lt;/ref&gt; It holds that absolute [[chance (philosophy)|chance]], also called spontaneity, is a real factor operative in the universe. It may be considered both the direct opposite of [[Einstein]]'s oft quoted dictum that: "[[God does not play dice]] with the universe" and an early philosophical anticipation of [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[uncertainty principle]].

Peirce does not, of course, assert that there is ''no'' law in the universe. On the contrary, he maintains that an absolutely chance world would be a contradiction and thus impossible.
Complete lack of order is itself a sort of order. The position he advocates is rather that there are in the universe both regularities and irregularities.

[[Karl Popper]] comments&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K: ''Of Clouds and Cuckoos'', included in ''Objective Knowledge'', revised, 1978, p231.&lt;/ref&gt; that Peirce's theory received little contemporary attention, and that other philosophers did not adopt indeterminism until the rise of quantum mechanics.

===Arthur Holly Compton===
In 1931, [[Arthur Holly Compton]] championed the idea of human freedom based on [[quantum indeterminacy]] and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring [[Randomness|chance]] into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the [[Schrödinger's cat]] paradox.&lt;ref&gt;SCIENCE, 74, p. 1911, August 14, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reacting to criticisms that his ideas made chance the direct cause of our actions, Compton clarified the two-stage nature of his idea in an ''Atlantic Monthly'' article in 1955. First there is a range of random possible events, then one adds a determining factor in the act of [[choice]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;A set of known physical conditions is not adequate to specify precisely what a forthcoming event will be. These conditions, insofar as they can be known, define instead a range of possible events from among which some particular event will occur. When one exercises freedom, by his act of choice he is himself adding a factor not supplied by the physical conditions and is thus himself determining what will occur. That he does so is known only to the person himself. From the outside one can see in his act only the working of physical law. It is the inner knowledge that he is in fact doing what he intends to do that tells the actor himself that he is free.&lt;ref&gt;"Science and Man’s Freedom", in ''The Cosmos of Arthur Holly Compton'', 1967, Knopf, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Compton welcomed the rise of indeterminism in 20th century science, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In my own thinking on this vital subject I am in a much more satisfied state of mind than I could have been at any earlier stage of science. If the statements of the laws of physics were assumed correct, one would have had to suppose (as did most philosophers) that the feeling of freedom is illusory, or if [free] choice were considered effective, that the laws of physics ... [were] unreliable. The dilemma has been an uncomfortable one.&lt;ref&gt;Commpton, A.H. ''The Human Meaning of Science'' p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Together with Arthur Eddington in Britain, Compton was one of those rare distinguished physicists in the English speaking world of the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s arguing for the “liberation of free will” with the help of Heisenberg’s  indeterminacy principle, but their efforts had been met not only with physical and philosophical criticism but most primarily with fierce political and ideological campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kožnjak|first=Boris|title=The Earliest Missionaries of ‘Quantum Free Will’: A Socio-Historical Analysis|date=2018|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-99295-2_10|work=Free Will &amp; Action|pages=131–154|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-99295-2_10|isbn=9783319992945|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Karl Popper===
In his essay ''Of Clouds and Cuckoos'', included in his book ''Objective Knowledge'', [[Karl Popper|Popper]]
contrasted "clouds", his metaphor for indeterministic systems, with "clocks", meaning deterministic ones.
He sided with indeterminism, writing
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I believe Peirce was right in holding that all clocks are clouds to some considerable degree — even the most precise of clocks. This, I think, is the most important inversion of the mistaken determinist view that all clouds are clocks&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K: ''Of Clouds and Cuckoos'', included in ''Objective Knowledge'', revised, 1978, p215.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Popper was also a promoter of [[propensity probability]].

===Robert Kane===
Kane is one of the leading contemporary philosophers on [[free will]].&lt;ref name = "KaneFreeWill"&gt;Kane, R. (ed.) ''Oxford Handbook of Free Will''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/kane/ Information Philosophers] "Robert Kane is the acknowledged dean of the libertarian philosophers writing actively on the free will problem."&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocating what is termed within philosophical circles "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]] freedom", Kane argues that "(1) the existence of alternative possibilities (or the agent's power to do otherwise) is a necessary condition for acting freely, and (2) determinism is not compatible with alternative possibilities (it precludes the power to do otherwise)".&lt;ref&gt;Kane (ed.): ''Oxford Handbook of Free Will'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note that the crux of Kane's position is grounded not in a defense of alternative possibilities (AP) but in the notion of what Kane refers to as ultimate responsibility (UR).  Thus, AP is a necessary but insufficient criterion for free will.  It is necessary that there be ([[Metaphysics|metaphysically]]) real alternatives for our actions, but that is not enough; our actions could be random without being in our control.  The control is found in "ultimate responsibility".

What allows for ultimate responsibility of creation in Kane's picture are what he refers to as "self-forming actions" or SFAs — those moments of indecision during which people experience conflicting wills.  These SFAs are the undetermined, regress-stopping voluntary actions or refrainings in the life histories of agents that are required for UR.  UR does not require that ''every'' act done of our own free will be undetermined and thus that, for every act or choice, we could have done otherwise; it requires only that certain of our choices and actions be undetermined (and thus that we could have done otherwise), namely SFAs.  These form our character or nature; they inform our future choices, reasons and motivations in action.  If a person has had the opportunity to make a character-forming decision (SFA), he is responsible for the actions that are a result of his character.

===Mark Balaguer===

[[Mark Balaguer]], in his book ''Free Will as an Open Scientific Problem''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=19727 Notre Dame Reviews: ''Free Will as an Open Scientific Problem'']&lt;/ref&gt; argues similarly to Kane. He believes that, conceptually,  free will requires indeterminism, and the question of whether the brain behaves indeterministically is open to further [[empirical]] research. He has also written on this matter "A Scientifically Reputable Version of Indeterministic Libertarian Free Will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turingc.blogspot.pt/2012/07/mark-balaguer-scientifically-reputable.html|title=Mark Balaguer: A Scientifically Reputable Version of Indeterministic Libertarian Free Will|website=turingc.blogspot.pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science==
{{see also|Philosophy of physics#Indeterminism|label 1=Philosophy of physics and indeterminism}}

===Mathematics===
In [[probability theory]], a [[stochastic process]] {{IPAc-en|s|t|oʊ|ˈ|k|æ|s|t|ɪ|k}}, or sometimes random process, is the counterpart to a deterministic process (or [[deterministic system]]). Instead of dealing with only one possible reality of how the process might evolve over time (as is the case, for example, for solutions of an [[ordinary differential equation]]), in a stochastic or random process there is some indeterminacy in its future evolution described by probability distributions. This means that even if the initial condition (or starting point) is known, there are many possibilities the process might go to, but some paths may be more probable and others less so.

===Classical and relativistic physics===
The idea that [[Newtonian physics]] proved causal determinism was highly influential in the early modern period.
"Thus physical determinism [..] became the ruling faith among enlightened men; and everybody who did not embrace this new faith was held to be an obscurantist and a reactionary".&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K: ''Of Clouds and Cuckoos'', included in ''Objective Knowledge'', revised, 1978, p212.&lt;/ref&gt; However: "Newton himself may be counted among the few dissenters, for he regarded the solar system as ''imperfect'', and consequently as likely to perish".&lt;ref&gt;Popper, 1978, citing, Henry Pemberton's ''A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical chaos]] is not usually considered an example of indeterminism, as it can occur in deterministic systems such as the [[three-body problem]].

[[John Earman]] has argued that most physical theories are indeterministic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/Determinism.pdf Earman, J. ''Determinism: What We Have Learned, and What We Still Don't Know'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/#StaDetPhy The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: ''Causal Determinism'']&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Newtonian physics admits solutions where particles accelerate continuously, heading out towards infinity. By the [[time reversibility]] of the laws in question, particles could also head inwards, unprompted by any pre-existing state. He calls such hypothetical particles "[[space invaders (classical physics)|space invaders]]".

John D. Norton has suggested another indeterministic scenario, known as [[Norton's Dome]], where a particle is initially situated on the exact apex of a dome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''Causal Determinism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Branching space-time]] is a theory uniting indeterminism and the [[special theory of relativity]]. The idea was originated by [[Nuel Belnap]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://confer.uj.edu.pl/branching/ Conference on Branching Space Time]&lt;/ref&gt; The equations of [[general relativity]] admit of both indeterministic and deterministic solutions.

[[Ludwig Boltzmann]], was one of the founders of [[statistical mechanics]] and the modern [[atomic theory of matter]]. He is remembered for his discovery that  the [[second law of thermodynamics]] is a statistical law  stemming from [[Chaos theory|disorder]]. He also speculated that the ordered universe we see is only a small bubble in much larger sea of chaos. The [[Boltzmann brain]] is a similar idea. He can be considered one  of few indeterminists to embrace pure chance.

===Evolution and biology===
[[Darwinian evolution]] has an enhanced reliance on the chance element of [[random mutation]] compared to the earlier evolutionary theory of [[Herbert Spencer]]. However, the question of whether evolution requires genuine ontological indeterminism is open to debate&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/millstein/papers/Millstein_agnosticism.pdf  Millstein, R.L.: ''Is the Evolutionary Process Deterministic or Indeterministic'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay ''[[Chance and Necessity]]'' (1970) Jacques Monod rejected the role of [[final causation]] in [[biology]], instead arguing that a mixture of [[efficient causation]] and "pure chance" lead to [[teleonomy]], or merely ''apparent'' purposefulness.

The Japanese theoretical population geneticist [[Motoo Kimura]] emphasises the role of indeterminism in evolution.  According to [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]]: "at the molecular level most evolutionary change is caused by [[random drift]] of [[mutation|gene mutants]] that are equivalent in the face of selection.&lt;ref&gt;Kimura, M. ''The neutral theory of molecular evolution'', (''The Science'', No. 1, 1980, p. 34)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prigogine===

In his 1997 book, ''The End of Certainty'', Prigogine contends that determinism is no longer a viable scientific belief. "The more we know about our universe, the more difficult it becomes to believe in determinism." This is a major departure from the approach of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], all of whom expressed their theories in terms of deterministic equations. According to Prigogine, determinism loses its explanatory power in the face of [[irreversibility]] and [[instability]].&lt;ref&gt;End of Certainty by Ilya Prigogine pp. 162–85 Free Press; 1 edition (August 17, 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-684-83705-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-VI8093PJuUC&amp;pg=PA183]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prigogine traces the dispute over determinism back to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], whose attempt to explain individual variability according to evolving populations inspired [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] to explain the behavior of gases in terms of populations of particles rather than individual particles.&lt;ref&gt;End of Certainty by Ilya Prigogine pp. 19–21 Free Press; 1 edition (August 17, 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-684-83705-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-VI8093PJuUC&amp;pg=PA19]&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the field of [[statistical mechanics]] and the realization that gases undergo irreversible processes. In deterministic physics, all processes are time-reversible, meaning that they can proceed backward as well as forward through time. As Prigogine explains, determinism is fundamentally a denial of the [[arrow of time]]. With no arrow of time, there is no longer a privileged moment known as the "present," which follows a determined "past" and precedes an undetermined "future." All of time is simply given, with the future as determined or undetermined as the past. With irreversibility, the arrow of time is reintroduced to physics. Prigogine notes numerous examples of irreversibility, including [[diffusion]], [[radioactive decay]], [[solar radiation]], [[weather]] and the emergence and evolution of [[life]]. Like weather systems, organisms are unstable systems existing far from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. Instability resists standard deterministic explanation. Instead, due to sensitivity to initial conditions, unstable systems can only be explained statistically, that is, in terms of [[probability]].

Prigogine asserts that [[Newtonian physics]] has now been "extended" three times, first with the use of the wave function in [[quantum mechanics]], then with the introduction of spacetime in [[general relativity]] and finally with the recognition of indeterminism in the study of unstable systems.

===Quantum mechanics===
{{main article|quantum indeterminacy}}
At one time, it was assumed in the physical sciences that if the behavior observed in a system cannot be predicted, the problem is due to lack of fine-grained information, so that a sufficiently detailed investigation would eventually result in a deterministic theory ("If you knew exactly all the forces acting on the dice, you would be able to predict which number comes up").

However, the advent of [[quantum mechanics]] removed the underpinning from that approach, with the claim that (at least according to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]]) the most basic constituents of matter at times behave [[quantum indeterminism|indeterministically]]. This comes from the [[wave function collapse|collapse of the wave function]], in which the state of a system upon [[measurement problem|measurement]] cannot in general be predicted.  Quantum mechanics only predicts the probabilities of possible outcomes, which are given by the [[Born rule]]. Non-deterministic behavior upon wave function collapse is not only a feature of the Copenhagen interpretation, with its [[observer (quantum mechanics)|observer]]-dependence, but also of [[objective collapse theories]].

Opponents of quantum indeterminism suggested that determinism could be restored by formulating a new theory in which additional information, so-called [[hidden variable (physics)|hidden variables]]
,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/online/4137/how-much-free-will-do-we-have: Cosmos Magazine: ''How Much Free Will Do We Have'']&lt;/ref&gt; would allow definite outcomes to be determined. For instance, in 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen wrote a paper titled ''"[[EPR paradox|Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?]]"'' arguing that such a theory was in fact necessary to preserve the [[principle of locality]].
In 1964, [[John S. Bell]] was able to define [[Bell's theorem|a theoretical test]] for these local hidden variable theories, which was reformulated as a workable experimental test through the work of [[CHSH inequality|Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt]]. The negative result of the 1980s [[Aspect experiment|tests]] by [[Alain Aspect]] ruled such theories out, provided certain [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments|assumptions]] about the experiment hold. Thus any [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]], including deterministic reformulations, must either reject [[Principle of locality|locality]] or reject [[counterfactual definiteness]] altogether. [[David Bohm]]'s [[Bohmian quantum mechanics|theory]] is the main example of a non-local deterministic quantum theory.

The [[many-worlds interpretation]] is said to be deterministic, but experimental results still cannot be predicted: experimenters do not know which 'world' they will end up in. Technically, [[counterfactual definiteness]] is lacking.

A notable consequence of quantum indeterminism is the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], which prevents the simultaneous accurate measurement of all a particle's properties.

===Cosmology===
[[Primordial fluctuations]] are density variations in the early universe which are considered the seeds of all [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|structure]] in the universe. Currently, the most widely accepted explanation for their origin is in the context of [[cosmic inflation]]. According to the inflationary paradigm, the exponential growth of the [[scale factor]] during inflation caused [[quantum fluctuation]]s of the inflaton field to be stretched to macroscopic scales, and, upon leaving the [[Observable universe#Cosmological horizon|horizon]], to "freeze in".
At the later stages of radiation- and matter-domination, these fluctuations re-entered the horizon, and thus set the [[initial conditions]] for [[structure formation]].

===Neuroscience===
[[Neuroscientist]]s such as Bjoern Brembs and [[Christof Koch]] believe thermodynamically [[stochastic processes]] in the brain are the basis of [[free will]], and that even very simple organisms such as [[flies]] have a form of free will.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11998687 BBC Science: ''Free Will Similar in Animals, Humans—But Not So Free'']&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ideas are put forward by some philosophers such as [[indeterminism#Robert Kane|Robert Kane]].

Despite recognizing indeterminism to be a very low-level, necessary prerequisite, Bjoern Brembs says that it's not even close to being sufficient for addressing things like morality and responsibility.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; [[Edward O. Wilson]] does not extrapolate from bugs to people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/01/is-homosexualit/|title=Is Homosexuality an Evolutionary Step Towards the Superorganism?|publisher=|date=2008-01-03|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Corina E. Tarnita]] alerts against trying to draw parallels between people and insects, since human selflessness and cooperation, however, is of a different sort, also involving the interaction of culture and sentience, not just genetics and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/08/kin-selection-challenged/|title=E.O. Wilson Proposes New Theory of Social Evolution|publisher=|date=2010-08-26|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
Against [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and others who advocated [[determinism]], indeterminism—as championed by the English astronomer [[Sir Arthur Eddington]]—says that a physical object has an [[ontology|ontologically]] undetermined component that is not due to the [[epistemology|epistemological]] limitations of physicists' understanding. The [[uncertainty principle]], then, would not necessarily be due to [[Hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] but to an indeterminism in nature itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Determinism and indeterminism are examined in ''Causality and Chance in Modern Physics''  by [[David Bohm]]. He speculates that, since determinism can emerge from underlying indeterminism (via the [[law of large numbers]]), and that indeterminism can emerge from determinism (for instance, from [[classical chaos]]), the universe could be conceived of as having alternating layers of causality and chaos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Causality-Chance-Modern-Physics-David/dp/0812210026 Bohm, D: ''Causality and Chance in Modern Physics'', pp. 29–33 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internarrative identity''' is building upon the notion of [[narrative Identity]], the idea that our [[Identity (social science)|identities]] are shaped by the accounts we give of our lives. The central tenet of internarrative identity is that the ability of individuals to shape their lives is extended by multiple [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] narratives with associative principles beyond [[temporality]]. This concept was developed in 1997 by Ajit K. Maan in the central text Internarrative Identity.

==Overview==
While the foundation of Narrative Identity Theory is the holding together of life experiences in a unified structure, Internarrative Identity Theory celebrates what have previously been considered problematic areas of experience - [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]], [[marginalization]], disruption, [[subversion]], [[Deviationism|deviation]] - as places of possibility for [[self (psychology)|self]] creation.
Internarrative Identity Theory locates the solution of narrative conflict within the problem itself. Existence in-between authoritarian discourses and [[dominant culture]]s enables an extended form of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] wherein a subject is able to undermine traditional associations, assumptions, concepts, and at the same time, create links between otherwise incommensurable [[world view]]s. Rather than being a passive recipient of dominant discourses the Internarrative subject is uniquely able to subvert regulatory identity practices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19824">{{main article|International Date Line}}
The '''international date line&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In this article, the convention used is to capitalize "Date Line" (or "International Date Line") when it refers to the ''standard'' [[International Date Line]], but to use small letters to refer to possible construct(s) under Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt;  in Judaism''' is used to demarcate the change of one calendar day to the next in the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]]. The Jewish calendar defines days as running from sundown to sundown rather than midnight to midnight. So in the context of Judaism, an international date line demarcates when the line of sundown moving across the Earth's surface stops being the sundown ending and starting one day and starts being the sundown ending and starting the following day.

However, the conventional [[International Date Line]] is a relatively recent geographic and political construct whose exact location has moved from time to time depending on the needs of different interested parties. While it is well-understood why the conventional date line is located in the Pacific Ocean, there are not really objective criteria for its exact placement within the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[International Date Line|main article]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; In that light, it cannot be taken for granted that the conventional International Date Line can (or should) be used as a date line under Jewish law. In practice, within Judaism the ''[[Jewish law|halakhic]]'' date line is similar to, but not necessarily identical with, the conventional Date Line, and the differences can have consequences under religious law.

==Location of the date line==

===Theoretical basis for the discussion===
Many of the opinions about the ''halakhic'' date line are structured as a response to the question of what days someone should observe as [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]]. Shabbat occurs every seven days at any location on earth. It is normally thought to occur on Saturday—or more precisely, from Friday at sundown to Saturday at nightfall. But if the ''halakhic'' date line is not identical to the conventional Date Line, it is possible that what is Saturday with respect to the conventional Date Line is not Saturday with respect to the ''halakhic'' date line, at least in some places.

There are several opinions regarding where exactly the ''halakhic'' date line should be according to Jewish law, and at least one opinion that says that no ''halakhic'' date line really exists.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref name="taarich"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taplin |first1=Rabbi Yisroel |authorlink1=Yisroel Taplin |title=Sefer Taarich Yisroel |date=1998–1999 |location=Lakewood, NJ |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |language=Hebrew|postscript=,}} which is summarized in English at {{cite web |title=Kitzur Taarich Yisroel: The Dateline in Halacha |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |website=www.datelineinhalacha |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=map&gt;[http://www.star-k.org/articles/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IDL_Map.pdf The International Dateline in Halacha (Star-K)(map)], 170 kB&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|90}}'''1. ''90 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' The concept of a ''halakhic'' date line is mentioned in the ''[[Baal HaMeor]],'' a 12th-century Talmudic commentary,&lt;ref name=kashrus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/493/a-travelers-guide-to-the-international-dateline/ |last=Heber|first=Rabbi Dovid|title=A Traveller's Guide To The International Dateline |publisher=Star-k.org |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbeinu Zecharya Halevi, ''Baal Hameor'', Tractate Rosh Hashana, 20b&lt;/ref&gt; which seems to indicate that the day changes in an area where the time is six hours ahead of [[Jerusalem]] (90 degrees east of Jerusalem, about 125.2°E, a line now known to run through [[Australia]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]] and [[Russia]]). This line, which he refers to as the ''K'tzai Hamizrach'' (the easternmost line), is used to calculate the day of [[Rosh Hashanah]], the Jewish New Year. According to some sources it is alluded to in both the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Eruvin (Talmud)|Eruvin]]) and in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]].  The ''[[Kuzari]]'' of [[Yehuda Halevi]], also a 12th-century work, seems to agree with this ruling.

Later decisors like the ''[[Chazon Ish]]'' (twentieth century) fundamentally agree with this ruling. However, they recognize practical issues associated with the pure use of a line of longitude for this purpose. As an example, 125.2°E passes directly through Dongfeng Street in [[Changchun]], China.&lt;ref&gt;To be precise, at a point 1.11 km east of Xihu Rd. See [https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=43.84%2C125.2#map=12/43.8400/125.1999 location on OpenStreetMaps.]&lt;/ref&gt; If this line of longitude were used strictly, people could simply avoid Shabbat altogether by crossing the street. To prevent that, the Chazon Ish rules{{refn|Cited in Taplin&lt;ref name="taarich /&gt; at footnote 16 of the web page.}}&lt;ref name="RJJ"&gt;This is rejected by the [[Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik|Brisker Rav]] (see {{cite journal|last1=Pahmer|first1=David|title=The International Date Line and Related Issues|journal=RJJ Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society|date=1990|volume=XXI|pages=60–83|url=http://download2.yutorah.org/1991/1053/735807.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2016|postscript=}} at page 69), who rules that the use of this meridian is absolute.&lt;/ref&gt; that the contiguous land masses to the east of that line of longitude are considered secondary (''tafel'') to the land masses west of that line. As a result, he rules that the date line runs along 125.2°E when over water, but curves around the eastern coast of mainland Asia and Australia. By this view, Russia, China and Australia are west of the date line and observe Shabbat on local Saturday. [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Tasmania]] are east of the date line and should observe Shabbat on local Sunday, as defined by the conventional International Date Line. By this view, the Philippines and [[Indonesia]] would have portions west of the line and portions east of the line.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;

'''2. ''180 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' Rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Tucazinsky]] ruled that the International Date Line is 180 degrees east of Jerusalem.  That would mean that the date line, rather than being near 180°, would be at 144.8°W.  By this view, places east of the conventional International Date Line but west of 144.8°W—[[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]] and a variety of archipelagos in the Pacific—would observe Shabbat on the local Friday instead of the local Saturday.

It is possible (but not certain) under this view to apply the principal of ''tafel'' described above as well. In that event, mainland Alaska would be east of the date line, but the [[Aleutian Islands]] would be west of the date line.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;

'''3. ''Mid-Pacific.''''' A variety of decisors{{refn|''Inter alia,'' Rabbis David Shapira, B. Rabinowitz Thumim, the ''Atzei Sodeh,'' and the ''Alai Yonah.'' These decisors do not necessarily rule identically to each other.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shurpin|first1=Rabbi Yehuda|title=The Sabbath, the International Date Line and Jewish Law|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1736567/jewish/|website=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} rule that the date line runs in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, close to (but not necessarily the same as) the conventional International Date Line. According to this point of view, all of the major populated areas of the Pacific (such as New Zealand, Japan, Alaska and Hawaii) observe Shabbat on local Saturday (that is, consistent with the conventional International Date Line). Only certain Pacific islands, generally having few or no permanent Jewish residents, might not observe Shabbat on local Saturday.&lt;ref name=map/&gt;

'''4. ''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' According to Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Kasher]], there is no clear tradition or Talmudic source dictating any of the preceding opinions as binding. For that reason, and consistent with a [[History of responsa in Judaism|responsum]] of the [[Radbaz]], Rabbi Kasher starts with the default law that a Jew not knowing the proper day for Shabbat should count days from the last time s/he observed Shabbat, and that every seven days is Shabbat. In his view, established Jewish communities are presumed to have fixed their calendars according to this principle. Therefore, Shabbat in an established community is whatever day the community has established. Rabbi [[Isser Zalman Meltzer]] and Rabbi [[Zvi Pesach Frank]] apparently agree with this position.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref name=gewirtz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gewirtz|first1=William L.|title=Zemannim: On the Introduction of New Constructs in Halakhah|journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal|date=2012–13|volume=16|pages=153–172|jstor=23596060}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} This position does not in and of itself require a formal date line to be established, and Rabbi Kasher does not seem to think that it is necessary to do so. But the ''de facto'' result of this position is consistent with the conventional International Date Line, at least anywhere there is an established Jewish community.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;{{refn|Rabbi Shurpin&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;{{rp|Note 14}} and Gewirtz&lt;ref name=gewirtz/&gt;{{rp|Note 4}} provide treatments as to how [[International Date Line#Historical alterations|changes in the location of the International Date Line]] might affect its use as a ''de facto'' standard in Jewish Law.}}

===Practical rulings===
In practice, the conventional International Date Line (or another mid-Pacific line near it) is the ''de facto'' date line under Jewish law, at least for established Jewish communities. The communities of Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jccjapan.or.jp/ Jewish Community of Japan], [http://www.jcckobe.org/ Jewish Community of Kansai]&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chc.org.nz/ Canterbury Hebrew Congregation], [http://ahc.org.nz/category/events/ Auckland Hebrew Congregation]&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sofmaarav.org/ Congregation Sof Maarav], [http://www.mauijews.org/#!events/c17et Jewish Congregation of Maui]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[French Polynesia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Andrew|title=Shabbat in Tahiti paradise|url=http://www.jewishnews.net.au/shabbat-in-tahiti-paradise/14535|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=The Australian Jewish News|date=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; all observe Shabbat on local Saturday ''(i.e.,'' Friday night until Saturday night). No known Jewish community observes Shabbat on a day other than local Saturday.&lt;ref name=jta&gt;The one arguable exception is [[Samoa]], which moved from the east side of the International Date Line to the west side around New Year's Day 2012. The [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] located one relatively observant Jewish individual living on Samoa, who said at the time that he would follow the lead of local [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] churches and light Shabbat candles on Saturday night. (See {{cite news|last1=Soclof|first1=Adam|title=Samoa time warps into Shabbat|url=http://www.jta.org/2012/01/03/the-archive-blog/samoa-time-warps-into-shabbat|accessdate=27 April 2016|agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=3 January 2012|postscript=.)}} However, the practice of a single individual may not be sufficient to establish a community practice in Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that practical conclusion is reached in two different ways, resulting in somewhat different practice patterns in each case.

'''''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' As noted above, according to this point of view, Shabbat is simply observed on the date previously established as Shabbat by the local community—uniformly, local Saturday&lt;ref name=jta/&gt;—without any need for any further observance. This appears to be the default practice for residents of such places as Japan, New Zealand and Hawaii. At minimum, it is difficult to find evidence of other practices by residents of those areas.&lt;ref name=worker&gt;See, as an anecdotal example, {{cite web|title=The international dateline and halacha|url=http://jewishworker.blogspot.com/2005/09/international-dateline-and-halacha.html|website=The Jewish Worker|accessdate=27 April 2016|postscript=;}} search the page for "NZ".&lt;!--This is a blog, and the pertinent comment was in the responses, not in the blog post itself. As a source, it doesn't really qualify as a RS, and it is intended to be illustrative, rather than definitive. But there is little in the way of reliable evidence, which is not surprising given that one is essentially trying to prove a negative.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Taken to a fully logical conclusion, ''no fixed date line'' means that anyone in a location without an established tradition of which day is Shabbat should always depend on his own personal count of days. It is not clear whether this can currently apply to someone traveling on his or her own to an island in the Western Pacific without an established tradition. (See, for example, Rabbi Shurpin {{refn|name=chabad}} at the end of the section "The Samoa issue".) However, it seems clear that at minimum one construes an "established community" relatively broadly. So while Japan, for example, has only a scattered handful of synagogues, their uniform practice of observing Shabbat on Saturday seems sufficient to fix Saturday as the established day for Shabbat anywhere in Japan.}}

'''''Establishment of a date line by a majority among three halakhic positions.''''' The travelers' guide of the [[Star-K]] kosher supervision service, compiled according to the rulings of its rabbinic administrator, Rabbi [[Moshe Heinemann]], uses the following approach,&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; which is also cited by others. According to this approach, the [[#90|first three numbered sections above]] constitute three valid, parallel, ''halakhic'' rulings. Shabbat is consequently fully observed on whichever day is consistent with the majority view among those opinions (two out of three). However, out of respect to the minority view of the third ruling, and with an eye toward not desecrating Shabbat, [[Melacha|Torah-level prohibitions]] are to be avoided on the day consistent with the minority view, although that day is otherwise considered a weekday. According to this rule, practice is as follows: 
* In New Zealand and Japan, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to the majority opinion (sections 2 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 1 above), Shabbat is on the local Sunday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Sunday. Nevertheless, on Sunday, one should pray the regular weekday prayers, donning [[tefillin]] during morning prayers.
* In Hawaii and French Polynesia, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to majority opinion (sections 1 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 2 above), Shabbat is on the local Friday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Friday. Friday prayers are weekday prayers, and preparation for Shabbat must be done with an eye to avoiding Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; 
* In principle, a zone of pure doubt exists in approximately the area of 169°W–177°E,&lt;ref name=map/&gt; including places like [[Tonga]], Samoa and [[American Samoa]]. The rulings of the ''Mid-Pacific'' group above are not perfectly consistent in this area,&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; so there is no possibility of an unambiguous "two out of three" consensus here. Rabbi Dovid Heber of the Star-K suggests that in such locations one might need to observe Shabbat fully for two days every week.&lt;ref name="heber2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heber|first1=Rabbi Dovid|title=How to Keep This Shabbos in Samoa? STAR-K Tells Us How (Samoa &amp; Tokelau To Cross International Date Line)|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/113307/how-to-keep-this-shabbos-in-samoa-star-k-tells-us-how-samoa-tokelau-to-cross-international-date-line.html|website=The Yeshiva World News|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Star-K's international kosher supervision staff follows this approach, and there is evidence that some other travelers also do.&lt;ref name=worker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Dateline|url=http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.culture.religion.jewish.avodah/26561|website=avodah@aishdas.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities suggesting this approach often advise travelers to avoid the zone of doubt entirely near weekends, or to consult with a competent rabbinical authority directly.&lt;ref name=heber2/&gt;

==Crossing the halakhic date line==
The issues discussed in the previous section apply ''per se'' to individuals or communities in fixed locations. However, the act of crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) introduces a number of additional issues under Jewish law. Questions potentially affected include:&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;
{{div col}}
*Crossing the line into or out of Shabbat or a holiday, or a [[Ta'anit|rabbinic fast day]], while already aboard an airplane or a ship
*Determining what prayers to say (and when) while in transit
*Lighting candles on [[Hanukkah]]
*[[Counting of the Omer]], and consequently fixing the day for [[Shavuot]]
*[[Niddah|Counting days until relations are permitted following menstruation]]
*Fixing the date for [[Brit Milah]], [[Pidyon Haben]] or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]
{{div col end}}
In some cases, crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) has a specific impact on practice or prohibitions under Jewish law. In others, an individual's count of days (by the experience of sunset and sunrise) is the determining factor, regardless of the crossing of the date line. Details around specific questions, cases and rulings of Jewish law are beyond the scope of this article.{{refn|See Taplin&lt;ref name="taarich" /&gt;, which covers these questions in some detail. The author notes that there are consensus opinions about some—but not all—of these issues.}}

==Considerations for astronauts==
Before Israeli astronaut [[Ilan Ramon]] flew on the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] in 2003, he decided (after consultation with rabbis) to observe Shabbat according to time in his last residence, [[Kennedy Space Center|Cape Canaveral]], since he would be crossing the date line and observing sunset many times per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ask the rabbi: Shabbat in space|date=18 January 2003|website=ohr.edu|publisher=[[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem]]|url=https://ohr.edu/explore_judaism/ask_the_rabbi/ask_the_rabbi/637|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|title=Ilan Ramon|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ilan-ramon|date=February 2, 2003|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=standard /&gt; [[Judith Resnik]], the first American Jewish astronaut in space, lit (electronic) Shabbat candles according to the time in [[Johnson Space Center|Houston, TX]], her home and the location of [[Christopher C.

In [[philosophy]], '''involution''' refers to a situation in which a process or object is [[ontology|ontologically]] "turned in" upon itself.

==Involuted values==
In [[meta-ethics]], involution of values is the extension of an otherwise convenient and decent system of values to its inevitable logical conclusion, with an indecent or inconvenient result.{{cn|date=April 2014}}

{{Tort law}}
{{Cleanup|date=May 2010}}
The '''last clear chance''' is a doctrine in the [[law]] of [[torts]] that is employed in [[contributory negligence]] jurisdictions. Under this doctrine, a negligent [[plaintiff]] can nonetheless recover if he is able to show that the [[defendant]] had the last opportunity to avoid the accident. Though the stated rationale has differed depending on the [[court]] adopting the doctrine, the underlying idea is to mitigate the harshness of the contributory negligence rule. The defendant can also use this doctrine as a defense.  If the plaintiff has the last clear chance to avoid the accident, the defendant will not be liable.

The [[Restatement (Second) of Torts]]&lt;ref&gt;Restatement (Second) of Torts § 766C (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; explains the doctrine in detail as follows:

{{quote|§ 479. LAST CLEAR CHANCE: HELPLESS PLAINTIFF

A plaintiff who has negligently subjected himself to a risk of harm from the defendant's subsequent negligence may recover for harm caused thereby if, immediately preceding the harm,

(a) the plaintiff is unable to avoid it by the exercise of reasonable vigilance and care, and

(b) the defendant is negligent in failing to utilize with reasonable care and competence his then existing opportunity to avoid the harm, when he

(i) knows of the plaintiff's situation and realizes or has reason to realize the peril involved in it or

(ii) would discover the situation and thus have reason to realize the peril, if he were to exercise the vigilance which it is then his duty to the plaintiff to exercise.

§ 480. LAST CLEAR CHANCE: INATTENTIVE PLAINTIFF

A plaintiff who, by the exercise of reasonable vigilance, could discover the danger created by the defendant's negligence in time to avoid the harm to him, can recover if, but only if, the defendant

(a) knows of the plaintiff's situation, and

(b) realizes or has reason to realize that the plaintiff is inattentive and therefore unlikely to discover his peril in time to avoid the harm, and

(c) thereafter is negligent in failing to utilize with reasonable care and competence his then existing opportunity to avoid the harm.

The introduction of the doctrine is widely attributed to the English case of ''[[Davies v. Mann]]'', 152 Eng. Rep. 588 (1842).}}

The '''less-is-better effect''' is a type of preference reversal that occurs when the lesser or smaller alternative of a proposition is preferred when evaluated separately, but not evaluated together. The term was first proposed by Christopher Hsee.&lt;ref name="hsee"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hsee|first=Christopher K.|title=Less Is Better: When Low-value Options Are Valued More Highly than High-value Options|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|year=1998|volume=11|pages=107–121|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0771(199806)11:2&lt;107::AID-BDM292&gt;3.0.CO;2-Y |url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/christopher.hsee/vita/papers/LessIsBetter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Another paradigm that incorporates this effect is ''[[Occam's razor]]'', which is referred to as simplifying a situation as much as possible to avoid confusion and annoyance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibbs|first1=Phil|first2=Hiroshi|last2=Sugihara|title=What is Occam's Razor?|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html|work=The Physics and Relativity FAQ|publisher=[[University of California, Riverside]]|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

==Identifying the effect==

In a 1998 study, Hsee, a professor at the Graduate School of Business of [[The University of Chicago]], discovered a less-is-better effect in three contexts: "(1) a person giving a $45 scarf (from scarves ranging from $5-$50) as a gift was perceived to be more generous than one giving a $55 coat (from coats ranging from $50-$500); (2) an overfilled ice cream serving with 7 oz of ice cream was valued more than an underfilled serving with 8 oz of ice cream; (3) a dinnerware set with 24 intact pieces was judged more favourably than one with 31 intact pieces (including the same 24) plus a few broken ones."&lt;ref name="hsee"/&gt;

Hsee noted that the less-is-better effect was observed "only when the options were evaluated separately, and reversed itself when the options were juxtaposed.” Hsee explained these seemingly counterintuitive results “in terms of the evaluability hypothesis, which states that separate evaluations of objects are often influenced by attributes which are easy to evaluate rather than by those which are important."&lt;ref name="hsee"/&gt;

==Other studies==
{{One source
| date = September 2018
}}
The less-is-better effect was demonstrated in several studies that preceded Hsee's 1998 experiment.

In 1992, a team led by [[Michael H. Birnbaum]] found "that an inferior risky option (e.g. a 5% chance to win $96 or $0) can be valued more highly than a superior risky option (e.g. a 5% chance to win $96 or $24)."&lt;ref name="hsee"/&gt;{{Clarify|reason=|date=September 2018}}

In a 1994 experiment by Max Bazerman et al., MBA students who were asked to evaluate various hypothetical job offers preferred lower-paying jobs for employers who paid other similarly qualified employees similar salaries to higher-paying jobs for employers who paid other employees more.&lt;ref name="hsee"/&gt;

In 1995, Victoria Husted Medvec and two colleagues reported that "athletes who had just won silver medals tended to be less happy than those who had just won bronze medals." The researchers explained this as follows: silver medalists felt as if they had just missed out on a gold, while bronze medalists felt as if they had almost not won anything.&lt;ref name="hsee"/&gt;

A 1996 study by Hsee asked participants to evaluate two used music dictionaries, one of which contained 20,000 entries and had a torn cover, the other of which contained 10,000 entries and looked brand-new. When evaluated separately, the newer-looking book was preferred; when evaluated together, the older book was chosen.&lt;ref name="hsee"/&gt;

In one study involving 83 students from a large university in the American Midwest, participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire. It asked them to imagine that a friend had given them a $55 wool coat from a store where coats run between $50 and $500, or, alternatively, a $45 wool scarf from a store where scarves cost between $5 and $50. When asked for their relative reactions to the two scenarios, the participants said that they would be happier with the scarf than with the coat and that the purchase of the scarf would reflect greater generosity than the purchase of the coat. Therefore, "if gift givers want their gift recipients to perceive them as generous, it is better for them to give a high-value item from a low-value product category (e.g. a $45 scarf) rather than a low-value item from a high-value product category (e.g. a $55 coat)."&lt;ref name="hsee"/&gt;

Participants in one study were asked to imagine that they were at the beach and in the mood for ice cream. One set of participants was asked to evaluate the value of 8 ounces of ice cream sold in a 10-ounce cup; another, to evaluate 7 ounces in a 5-ounce cup; a third, to compare the two. The second group liked their overfilled cups more than the first group liked their underfilled cups; but the third group, when presented with both options, recognized that the larger portion was more valuable than the smaller one.&lt;ref name="hsee"/&gt;

Another study showed that people "felt more grateful for a $45 dollar gift card than a $55 dollar coat." More oddly, they "were happier with a 24-piece dinnerware set that was intact than a 31-piece set, a couple of pieces of which was broken. The 31-piece set contained all the pieces of the 24-piece set, and all of them were intact. This made no difference to the recipients. All they could see was the loss of the broken pieces."&lt;ref name="Gizmodo"/&gt;

==General observations==
It has been observed that when consumers assess objects in isolation, they often compare them to other objects in the same category. "It seems that in evaluating a gift, people are neither sensitive to the actual price of the gift, nor to the category of that gift (e.g. whether a coat or a scarf), but they are very sensitive to the relative position of the gift within its category."&lt;ref name="hsee"/&gt;

It has also been observed that customers tend to be happier when merchants give them a little extra something that costs the merchant relatively little – a bonus scoop of ice cream on a sundae, for example – than when merchants actually offer them a better deal on the sundae that would cost the merchant more.&lt;ref name="Gizmodo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Inglis-Arkell|first1=Esther|title=The less-is-better effect lets you fake generosity|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-less-is-better-effect-lets-you-fake-generosity-1344651095|website=Gizmodo|publisher=Gizmodo|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
The less-is-better effect occurs only under specific circumstances. Evidence has shown that it manifests itself only when the options are evaluated individually; it disappears when they are assessed jointly.&lt;ref name="hsee"/&gt; "If the options are put right next to each other, the effect disappears, as people see the true value of both," states one source. "It's just the gifts in isolation that give people a flipped sense of happiness and gratitude."&lt;ref name="Gizmodo"/&gt;

==Hypothesized causes==
Theoretical causes of the less-is-better effect include:
* ''[[counterfactual thinking]]'' - A study found that bronze medalists are happier than silver medalists, apparently because silver invites comparison to gold whereas bronze invites comparison to not receiving a medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Medvec|first1=Victoria Husted|last2=Madey|first2=Scott F.|last3=Gilovich|first3=Thomas|title=When less is more: Counterfactual thinking and satisfaction among Olympic medalists|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1995|volume=69|issue=4|pages=603–610|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.4.603}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[evaluability heuristic]]'' and/or ''[[fluency heuristic]]'' - Hsee hypothesized that subjects evaluated proposals more highly based on attributes which were easier to evaluate&lt;ref name="hsee"/&gt; ([[attribute substitution]]). Another study found that students preferred funny versus artistic posters according to attributes they could verbalize easily, but the preference was reversed when they did not need to explain a reason&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=T. D.|author2=J. W. Schooler |title=Thinking too much: Introspection can reduce the quality of preferences and decisions|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=60|pages=181–192|authorlink=Timothy D. Wilson|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.60.2.181}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also ''[[introspection illusion]]'').
* ''[[representativeness heuristic]]'' or ''[[judgment by prototype]]'' - People judge things according to average of a set more easily than size, a component of [[extension neglect]].&lt;ref name=Kahneman2011&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Kahneman|title=Thinking, Fast and Slow|year=2011|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|pp=156–65,383,388|ISBN=9781429969352}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Kahneman uses the term "less-is-more effect" to indicate the "less-is-better effect".}}

==Applications==
The effect has several practical applications. If a conference speaker thinks that about 50 people will attend his talk, but wants to make it look popular, he should hold it in a small room, with 50 or fewer seats, than a large room with over 100 seats. A chocolatier is better off selling a box containing 24 pieces of top-quality candy than a box containing those 24 pieces plus 16 lower-quality pieces.&lt;ref name="hsee"/&gt;

If a manufacturer has developed two versions of a product and wishes to know which will be more popular with consumers and should therefore be put on the market, presenting them jointly to the public will enable consumers to evaluate differences between them, while presenting them separately will better predict the consumer's actual experience of the product when and if it is actually put on sale.&lt;ref name="hsee"/&gt;

[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
In [[cognitive psychology]] and [[decision theory]], '''loss aversion''' refers to people's tendency to prefer avoiding [[Loss function|losses]] to acquiring equivalent gains: it is better to not lose $5 than to find $5. The principle is very prominent in the domain of [[economics]]. What distinguishes loss aversion from [[risk aversion]] is that the [[utility]] of a monetary payoff depends on what was previously experienced or was expected to happen. Some studies have suggested that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1992|title=Advances in prospect theory: Cumulative representation of uncertainty|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|volume=5|pages=297–323|doi=10.1007/BF00122574|author1=Kahneman, D.|author2=Tversky, A.|lastauthoramp=yes|number=4|citeseerx=10.1.1.320.8769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loss aversion was first identified by [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=1979|title=Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1914185?origin=JSTOR-pdf|journal=Econometrica|volume=47|pages=263–291|doi=10.2307/1914185|via=|author1=Kahneman, D.|author2=Tversky, A.|lastauthoramp=yes|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss aversion implies that one who loses $100 will lose more satisfaction than another person will gain satisfaction from a $100 [[Windfall gain|windfall]]. In [[marketing]], the use of [[trial period]]s and [[Rebate (marketing)|rebates]] tries to take advantage of the buyer's tendency to value the [[Good (economics)|good]] more after the buyer incorporates it in the status quo. In past [[behavioral economics]] studies, users participate up until the threat of loss equals any incurred gains.  Recent methods established by Botond Kőszegi and Matthew Rabin in [[experimental economics]] illustrates the role of expectation, wherein an individual's belief about an outcome can create an instance of loss aversion, whether or not a tangible change of state has occurred.

Note that whether a transaction is [[Framing effect (psychology)|framed]] as a loss or as a gain is very important to this calculation: would you rather get a $5 discount, or avoid a $5 surcharge? The same change in price framed differently has a significant effect on consumer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Irwin P., Sandra L. Schneider, and Gary J. Gaeth. "All frames are not created equal: A typology and critical analysis of framing effects." Organizational behavior and human decision processes 76.2 (1998): 149-188.&lt;/ref&gt; Although traditional economists consider this "[[endowment effect]]" and all other effects of loss aversion to be completely [[Irrationality|irrational]], that is why it is so important to the fields of [[marketing]] and [[behavioral finance]]. The effect of loss aversion in a marketing setting was demonstrated in a study of consumer reaction to price changes to insurance policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dawes|first=J.|year=2004|title=Price Changes and Defection Levels in a Subscription-type Market: Can an Estimation Model Really Predict Defection Levels?|journal=Journal of Services Marketing|volume=18|issue=1|pages=35–44|doi=10.1108/08876040410520690}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found price increases had twice the effect on [[customer switching]], compared to price decreases. Similarly, users in behavioral and experimental economics studies decided to cease participation in iterative money-making games when the threat of loss was close to the expenditure of effort, even when the user stood to further their gains.

==The endowment effect==
Humans may be hardwired to be loss averse due to asymmetric evolutionary pressure on losses and gains: for an organism operating close to the edge of survival, the loss of a day's food could cause death, whereas the gain of an extra day's food would not cause an extra day of life (unless the food could be easily and effectively stored).

Loss aversion was first proposed as an explanation for the [[endowment effect]]—the fact that people place a higher value on a good that they own than on an identical good that they do not own—by Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler (1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=D. |last2=Knetsch |first2=J. |last3=Thaler |first3=R. |year=1990 |title=Experimental Test of the endowment effect and the Coase Theorem |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=98 |issue=6 |pages=1325–1348 |jstor=2937761 |doi=10.1086/261737}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loss aversion and the endowment effect lead to a violation of the [[Coase theorem]]—that "the allocation of resources will be independent of the assignment of property rights when costless trades are possible" (p.&amp;nbsp;1326).

In several studies, the authors demonstrated that the endowment effect could be explained by loss aversion but not five alternatives: (1) transaction costs, (2) misunderstandings, (3) habitual [[Bargaining power|bargaining behaviors]], (4) income effects, or (5) [[trophy]] effects. In each experiment half of the subjects were randomly assigned a good and asked for the minimum amount they would be willing to sell it for while the other half of the subjects were given nothing and asked for the maximum amount they would be willing to spend to buy the good. Since the value of the good is fixed and individual valuation of the good varies from this fixed value only due to sampling variation, the supply and demand curves should be perfect mirrors of each other and thus half the goods should be traded. The authors also ruled out the explanation that lack of experience with trading would lead to the endowment effect by conducting repeated markets.

The first two alternative explanations—that under-trading was due to transaction costs or misunderstanding—were tested by comparing goods markets to induced-value markets under the same rules. If it was possible to trade to the optimal level in induced value markets, under the same rules, there should be no difference in goods markets.

The results showed drastic differences between induced-value markets and goods markets. The [[median]] prices of buyers and sellers in induced-value markets matched almost every time leading to near perfect market efficiency, but goods markets sellers had much higher selling prices than buyers' buying prices. This effect was consistent over trials, indicating that this was not due to inexperience with the procedure or the market. Since the transaction cost that could have been due to the procedure was equal in the induced-value and goods markets, transaction costs were eliminated as an explanation for the endowment effect.

The third alternative explanation was that people have habitual bargaining behaviors, such as overstating their minimum selling price or understating their maximum bargaining price, that may spill over from strategic interactions where these behaviors are useful to the laboratory setting where they are sub-optimal. An experiment was conducted to address this by having the clearing prices selected at random. Buyers who indicated a willingness-to-pay higher than the randomly drawn price got the good, and vice versa for those who indicated a lower [[Willingness to pay|WTP]]. Likewise, sellers who indicated a lower willingness-to-accept than the randomly drawn price sold the good and vice versa. This incentive compatible value elicitation method did not eliminate the endowment effect but did rule out habitual bargaining behavior as an alternative explanation.

Income effects were ruled out by giving one third of the participants mugs, one third chocolates, and one third neither mug nor chocolate. They were then given the option of trading the mug for the chocolate or vice versa and those with neither were asked to merely choose between mug and chocolate. Thus, wealth effects were controlled for those groups who received mugs and chocolate. The results showed that 86% of those starting with mugs chose mugs, 10% of those starting with chocolates chose mugs, and 56% of those with nothing chose mugs. This ruled out income effects as an explanation for the endowment effect. Also, since all participants in the group had the same good, it could not be considered a "trophy", eliminating the final alternative explanation.

Thus, the five alternative explanations were eliminated in the following ways:
* 1 &amp; 2: Induced-value market vs. consumption goods market;
* 3: Incentive compatible value elicitation procedure;
* 4 &amp; 5: Choice between endowed or alternative good.

==Questions about its existence==
Recently, studies have questioned the existence of loss aversion. In several studies examining the effect of losses in decision making under risk and uncertainty no loss aversion was found.&lt;ref&gt;Erev, Ert &amp; Yechiam, 2008; Ert &amp; Erev, 2008; Harinck, Van Dijk, Van Beest, &amp; Mersmann, 2007; Kermer, Driver-Linn, Wilson, &amp; Gilbert, 2006; Nicolau, 2012; Yechiam &amp; Telpaz, in press&lt;/ref&gt; There are several explanations for these findings: one, is that loss aversion does not exist in small payoff magnitudes; the other, is that the generality of the loss aversion pattern is lower than that thought previously. Finally, losses may have an effect on attention but not on the weighting of outcomes; as suggested, for instance, by the fact that losses lead to more autonomic arousal than gains even in the absence of loss aversion.&lt;ref&gt;Hochman &amp; Yechiam, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This latter effect is sometimes known as Loss Attention.&lt;ref&gt;Yechiam &amp; Hochman, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Even in a non-risky domain, prospective affective judgments about gains and losses show that loss aversion is magnitude dependent such that for low magnitudes there is no loss aversion &lt;ref&gt;Mukherjee, S., Sahay, A., Pammi, V.S.C., &amp; Srinivasan, N. (2017). Is loss-aversion magnitude-dependent? Measuring prospective affective judgments regarding gains and losses. [http://journal.sjdm.org/16/16611/jdm16611.pdf Judgment and Decision Making], 12(1), 81-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss aversion may be more salient when people compete. Gill and Prowse (2012) provide experimental evidence that people are loss averse around reference points given by their expectations in a competitive environment with real effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gill, David  |author2=Victoria Prowse  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A structural analysis of disappointment aversion in a real effort competition |journal=American Economic Review |volume=102 |number=1 |pages=469–503 |year=2012 |ssrn=1578847 |doi=10.1257/aer.102.1.469|citeseerx=10.1.1.650.2595  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Gal]] (2006) argued that many of the phenomena commonly attributed to loss aversion, including the status quo bias, the endowment effect, and the preference for safe over risky options, are more parsimoniously explained by [[cognitive inertia|inertia]] than by a loss/gain asymmetry. Gal and Rucker (2018) made similar arguments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gal|first=David|last2=Rucker|first2=Derek D.|date=2018-04-20|title=The Loss of Loss Aversion: Will It Loom Larger Than Its Gain?|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1047|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=497–516|doi=10.1002/jcpy.1047|issn=1057-7408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gal|first=David|last2=Rucker|first2=Derek D.|date=2018-04-16|title=Loss Aversion, Intellectual Inertia, and a Call for a More Contrarian Science: A Reply to Simonson &amp; Kivetz and Higgins &amp; Liberman|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1044|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=533–539|doi=10.1002/jcpy.1044|issn=1057-7408}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==In nonhuman subjects==
In 2005, experiments were conducted on the ability of [[capuchin monkey]]s to use money. After several months of training, the monkeys began showing behavior considered to reflect understanding of the concept of a medium of exchange. They exhibited the same propensity to avoid perceived losses demonstrated by human subjects and investors.&lt;ref name = "Dubner"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/magazine/05FREAK.html | last = Dubner | first = Stephen J. | authorlink = Stephen J.

While a subsequent study suggested that the 2005 results were not indicative of loss aversion because of timing differences in the presentation of gains and losses to the monkeys,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silberberg|first=Alan|last2=Roma|first2=Peter G|last3=Huntsberry|first3=Mary E|last4=Warren-Boulton|first4=Frederick R|last5=Sakagami|first5=Takayuki|last6=Ruggiero|first6=Angela M|last7=Suomi|first7=Stephen J|date=March 2008|title=On Loss Aversion in Capuchin Monkeys|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|volume=89|issue=2|pages=145–155|doi=10.1901/jeab.2008-89-145|issn=0022-5002|pmc=2251327|pmid=18422015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a follow-up 2008 study by Laksminaryanan, Chen and Santos ruled out this alternative explanation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Expectation-based ==
Expectation-based loss aversion is a phenomenon in behavioral economics. When the expectations of an individual fail to match reality, they lose an amount of utility from the lack of experiencing fulfillment of these expectations. Analytical framework by Botond Kőszegi and Matthew Rabin provides a methodology through which such behavior can be classified and even predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kőszegi|first=Botond|last2=Rabin|first2=Matthew|date=2006-11-01|title=A Model of Reference-Dependent Preferences|url=http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/121/4/1133|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=121|issue=4|pages=1133–1165|doi=10.1093/qje/121.4.1133|issn=0033-5533|citeseerx=10.1.1.197.5740}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An individual's most recent expectations influences loss aversion in outcomes outside the status quo; a shopper intending to buy a pair of shoes on sale experiences loss aversion when the pair she had intended to buy is no longer available.

Subsequent research performed by Johannes Abeler, [[Armin Falk]], Lorenz Goette, and David Huffman in conjunction with the [[IZA Institute of Labor Economics|Institute of Labor Economics]] used the framework of Kőszegi and Rabin to prove that people experience expectation-based loss aversion at multiple thresholds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abeler|first=Johannes|last2=Falk|first2=Armin|last3=Goette|first3=Lorenz|last4=Huffman|first4=David|date=2011-04-01|title=Reference Points and Effort Provision|journal=American Economic Review|volume=101|issue=2|pages=470–492|doi=10.1257/aer.101.2.470|issn=0002-8282|citeseerx=10.1.1.472.7268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study evinced that reference points of people causes a tendency to avoid expectations going unmet. Participants were asked to participate in an iterative money-making task given the possibilities that they would receive either an accumulated sum for each round of "work", or a predetermined amount of money. With a 50% chance of receiving the "fair" compensation, participants were more likely to quit the experiment as this amount approached the fixed payment. They chose to stop when the values were equal as no matter which random result they received, their expectations would be matched. Participants were reluctant to work for more than the fixed payment as there was an equal chance their expected compensation would not be met.

==Within education==

Loss aversion experimentation has most recently been applied within an educational setting in an effort to improve achievement within the U.S.   Recent results from Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2009 ranked the US ranks #31 in math&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/pisa2009keyfindings.htm |title=PISA 2009 Results: What Students Know and Can Do: Student Performance in Reading, Mathematics and Science (Volume I) |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201195327/http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/pisa2009keyfindings.htm |archivedate=December 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and #17 in Reading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://statlinks.oecdcode.org/982010071P1T002.XLS]&lt;/ref&gt; In this latest experiment, Fryer et al. posits framing [[merit pay]] in terms of a loss in order to be most effective.  This study was performed in the city of Chicago Heights within nine K-8 urban schools, which included 3,200 students.  150 out of 160 eligible teachers participated and were assigned to one of four treatment groups or a control group.  Teachers in the incentive groups received rewards based on their students' end of the year performance on the ThinkLink Predictive Assessment and K-2 students took the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) in March. The control group followed the traditional merit pay process of receiving "bonus pay" at the end of the year based on student performance on standardized exams.  However, the experimental groups received a lump sum given at beginning of the year, that would have to be paid back.  The bonus was equivalent to approximately 8% of the average teacher salary in Chicago Heights, approximately $8,000.

Methodology—"Gain" and "Loss" teachers received identical net payments for a given level of performance. The only difference is the timing and framing of the rewards.  An advance on the payment and the re framing of the incentive as avoidance of a loss, the researchers observed treatment effects in excess of 0.20 and some as high as 0.398 [[standard deviations]].  According to the authors, 'this suggests that there may be significant potential for exploiting loss aversion in the pursuit of both optimal public policy and the pursuit of profits'.&lt;ref&gt;Fryer et al., [http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/enhancing_teacher_incentives.pdf "Enhancing the efficacy of teacher incentives through loss aversion"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915105312/http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/enhancing_teacher_incentives.pdf |date=September 15, 2012 }}, "Harvard University", 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilizing loss aversion, specifically within the realm of education, has gotten much notoriety in blogs and mainstream media.

The Washington Post discussed merit pay in a 2012 article and specifically the study conducted by Fryer et al.  The article discusses the positive results of the experiment and estimates the testing gains of those of the "loss" group are associated with an increase in lifetime earnings of between $37,180 and $77,740.  They also comment on the fact that it didn't matter much whether the pay was tied to the performance of a given teacher or to the team to which that teacher was assigned. They state that "a merit pay regime need not pit teachers in a given school against each other to get results".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/07/23/does-teacher-merit-pay-work-a-new-study-says-yes/|publisher=Washington Post|title=Does teacher merit pay work? A new study says yes.|date=July 23, 2012|author=Dylan Matthews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science Daily specifically covers the Fryer study stating that the study showed that "students gained as much as a 10 percentile increase in their scores compared to students with similar backgrounds -- if their teacher received a bonus at the beginning of the year, with conditions attached."   It also explains how there was no gain for students when teachers were offered the bonus at the end of the school year.

Thomas Amadio, superintendent of Chicago Heights Elementary School District 170, where the experiment was conducted, is quoted in this article stating "the study shows the value of merit pay as an encouragement for better teacher performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120809090335.htm|publisher=[[Science Daily]]|title=Student Scores Improve If Teachers Given Incentives Upfront|date=Aug 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education weekly also weighs in and discusses utilizing loss aversion within education, specifically merit pay.  The article states there are "few noteworthy limitations to the study, particularly relative to scope and sample size; further, the outcome measure was a 'low-stakes' diagnostic assessment, not the state test—it's unclear if findings would look the same if the test was used for accountability purposes. Still Fryer et al. have added an interesting tumbling element to the merit-pay routine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edexcellence.net/commentary/education-gadfly-weekly/2012/august-2/enhancing-the-efficacy-of-teacher-incentives-through-loss-aversion.html|title=Enhancing the Efficacy of Teacher Incentives through Loss Aversion: A Field Experiment|author=Amber M. Winkler|date=August 2, 2012|publisher=Education weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sun Times interviewed John List, Chairman of the University of Chicagos' department of economics.  He stated "It's a deeply ingrained behavioral trait. .. that all human beings have—this underlying phenomenon that 'I really, really dislike losses, and I will do all I can to avoid losing something'."  The article also speaks to only one other study to enhance performance in a work environment.   The only prior field study of a "loss aversion" payment plan, they said, "occurred in Nanjing, China, where it improved productivity among factory workers who made and inspected DVD players and other consumer electronics".  The article also covers a reaction by [[Barnett Berry]], president of the Center for Teaching Quality, who stated "the study seems to suggest that districts pay 'teachers working with children and adolescents' in the same way 'Chinese factory workers' were paid for 'producing widgets'. I think this suggests a dire lack of understanding of the complexities of teaching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/education/14687664-418/cash-upfront-the-way-to-get-teachers-to-rack-up-better-student-test-scores-study.html |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |title=Cash upfront the way to get teachers to rack up better student test scores, study finds |author=ROSALIND ROSSI |date=August 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229135931/http://www.suntimes.com/news/education/14687664-418/cash-upfront-the-way-to-get-teachers-to-rack-up-better-student-test-scores-study.html |archivedate=December 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been other criticism of the notion of loss aversion as an explanation of greater effects. Indeed, all of the noted findings in education can be explained simply by the additional attention to a task when it includes losses (i.e., loss attention), independently of the weighting to gains and losses.

Larry Ferlazzo in his blog questioned what kind of positive classroom culture a "loss aversion" strategy would create with students, and what kind of effect a similar plan with teachers would have on school culture. He states that "the usual kind of teacher merit pay is bad enough, but a threatened 'take-away' strategy might even be more offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2012/07/21/if-you-only-have-a-hammer-you-tend-to-see-every-problem-as-a-nail-economists-go-after-schools-again/|title="If you only have a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail" — Economists Go After Schools Again}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neural aspect of loss aversion ==
In earlier studies, both bidirectional [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] responses of activation for gains and deactivation for losses(or vica versa) and gain or loss-specific responses have been seen. While reward anticipation is associated with ventral [[striatum]] activation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/363/1511/3801.full.pdf|title=Explicit neural signals reflecting reward uncertainty|last=N.

It has later been proven that inconsistencies may only have been due to methodological issues including the utilisation of different tasks and stimuli, coupled with ranges of potential gains or losses sampled from either payoff matrices rather than parametric designs, and most of the data are reported in groups, therefore ignoring the variability amongst individuals. Thus later studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cresa.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Canessa-Motterlini-et-al.-2013-The-Functional-and-Structural-Neural-Basis-of-Individual-Differences-in-Loss-Aversion.pdf|title=The Functional and Structural Neural Basis of Individual Differences in Loss Aversion|last=Canessa|first=Nicola|date=September 4, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than focusing on subjects in groups, focus more on individual differences in the neural bases by jointly looking at behavioural analyses and neuroimaging.

[[Neuroimaging]] studies on loss aversion involves measuring brain activity with [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) to investigate whether individual variability in loss aversion were reflected in differences in brain activity through bidirectional or gain or loss specific responses, as well as multivariate source-based morphometry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811908010690|title=Joint source based morphometry identifies linked gray and white matter group differences|last=|first=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.09.051|pmid=18992825|volume=44|issue=3|journal=NeuroImage|pages=777–789|pmc=2669793|year=2008|last1=Xu|first1=L.|last2=Pearlson|first2=G.|last3=Calhoun|first3=V. D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (SBM) to investigate a structural network of loss aversion and univariate [[Voxel-based morphometry|voxel-basedmorphometry]] (VBM) to identify specific functional regions within this network.

Brain activity in a right ventral striatum cluster increases particularly when anticipating gains. This involves the ventral [[caudate nucleus]], [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallidum]], [[putamen]], bilateral [[orbitofrontal cortex]], superior frontal and middle [[Gyrus|gyri]], [[Posterior cingulate|posterior cingulate cortex]], dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and parts of the dorsomedial [[thalamus]] connecting to temporal and [[prefrontal cortex]]. There is a significant correlation between degree of loss aversion and strength of activity in both the frontomedial cortex and the ventral striatum. This is shown by the slope of brain activity deactivation for increasing losses being significantly greater than the slope of activation for increasing gains in the appetitive system involving the ventral striatum in the network of reward-based behavioural learning. On the other hand, when anticipating loss, the central and basal nuclei of amygdala, right posterior [[Insular cortex|insula]] extending into the [[supramarginal gyrus]] mediate the output to other structures involved in the expression of fear and anxiety, such as the right [[Operculum (brain)|parietal operculum]] and supramarginal gyrus. Consistent with gain anticipation, the slope of the activation for increasing losses was significantly greater than the slope of the deactivation for increasing gains.

Multiple neural mechanisms are recruited while making choices, showing functional and structural individual variability. Biased anticipation of negative outcomes leading to loss aversion involves specific [[Somatosensory system|somatosensory]] and [[Limbic system|limbic]] structures. fMRI test measuring neural responses in [[Striatum|striatal]], limbic and somatosensory brain regions help track individual differences in loss aversion. Its limbic component involved the amygdala(associated with negative emotion and plays a role in the expression of fear) and [[putamen]] in the [[right hemisphere]]. The somatosensory component included the middle [[cingulate cortex]], as well as the posterior insula and [[rolandic operculum]] bilaterally. The latter cluster partially overlaps with the right hemispheric one displaying the loss-oriented bidirectional response previously described, but, unlike that region, it mostly involved the posterior insula bilaterally. All these structures play a critical role in detecting threats and prepare the organism for appropriate action, with the connections between amygdala nuclei and the striatum controlling the avoidance of aversive events. There are functional differences between the right and left amygdala. Overall, the role of amygdala in loss anticipation suggested that loss aversion may reflect a [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian]] conditioned approach-avoidance response. Hence, there is a direct link between individual differences in the structural properties of this network and the actual consequences of its associated behavioral defense responses.

The neural activity involved in the processing of aversive experience and stimuli is not just a result of a temporary fearful overreaction prompted by choice-related information, but rather a stable component&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310649386|title=Neural markers of loss aversion in resting-state brain activity|last=Canessa|first=Nicole|date=19 November 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of one's own preference function, reflecting a specific pattern of neural activity encoded in the functional and structural construction of a limbic-somatosensory neural system anticipating heightened aversive state of the brain. Even when no choice is required, individual differences in the intrinsic responsiveness of this interoceptive system reflect the impact of anticipated negative effects on evaluative processes, leading preference for avoiding losses rather than acquiring greater but riskier gains.

Individual differences in loss aversion are related to variables such as age,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929312000825|title=Behavioral and neural correlates of loss aversion and risk avoidance in adolescents and adults|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.dcn.2012.09.007|pmid=23245222|volume=3|journal=Dev Cogn Neurosci|pages=72–83 | last1 = Barkley-Levenson | first1 = EE | last2 = Van Leijenhorst | first2 = L | last3 = Galván | first3 = A|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; gender, and genetic factors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nW65CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49|title=Society Organizations and the Brain: Building towards a UnifiedCognitive Neuroscience Perspective|last=|first=|date=2015-07-02|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|isbn=9782889195800|last1=Senior|first1=Carl|last2=Lee|first2=Nick|last3=Braeutigam|first3=Sven}}&lt;/ref&gt; affecting thalamic norepinephrine transmission, as well as neural structure and activities. Outcome anticipation and ensuing loss aversion involve multiple neural systems, showing functional and structural individual variability directly related to the actual outcomes of choices.

In a study, adolescents and adults are found to be similarly loss-averse on behavioural level but they demonstrated different underlying neural responses to the process of rejecting gambles. Although adolescents rejected the same proportion of trials as adults, adolescents displayed greater caudate and frontal pole activation than adults to achieve this. These findings suggest a difference in neural development during the avoidance of risk. It is possible that adding affectively arousing factors (e.g. peer influences) may overwhelm the reward-sensitive regions of the adolescent decision making system leading to risk-seeking behaviour. On the other hand, although men and women did not differ on their behavioural task performance, men showed greater neural activation than women in various areas during the task. Loss of striatal dopamine neurons is associated with reduced risk-taking behaviour.&amp;nbsp; Acute administration of D2 dopamine agonists may cause an increase in risky choices in humans. This suggests dopamine acting on stratum and possibly other mesolimbic structures can modulate loss aversion by reducing loss prediction signalling.

'''Meaning''' in [[existentialism]] is ''descriptive''; therefore it is unlike typical, ''prescriptive'' conceptions of "the [[meaning of life]]".{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Due to the methods of existentialism, prescriptive or declarative statements about meaning are unjustified.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}. The root of the word "meaning" is "mean", which is the way someone or something is conveyed, interpreted, or represented. Each individual has his or her own form of unique perspective; meaning is, therefore, purely subjective. Meaning is the way something is understood by an individual; in turn, this subjective meaning is also how the individual may identify it. Meaning is the personal significance of something physical or abstract. This would include the assigning of value(s) to such significance.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/existentialism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Steven|last=Crowell|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=16 October 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2012}}

==Kierkegaard==
{{Main|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard}}
{{blockquote|What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die. (...) I certainly do not deny that I still accept an imperative of knowledge and that through it men may be influenced, but then it must come alive in me, and this is what I now recognize as the most important of all.|Søren Kierkegaard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Søren|title=Soren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers, Part 1: Autobiographical, 1829--1848|editor=Howard V. Hong &amp; Edna H Hong|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XyNryDj1gAYC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%22What+I+really+need+is+to+get+clear+about+what+I+must+do%22&amp;hl=zh-CN&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jcrvUKiYHseR0QHJ0IGgCg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22What%20I%20really%20need%20is%20to%20get%20clear%20about%20what%20I%20must%20do%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Kierkegaard, meaning does not equal knowledge, although both are important. Meaning, for Kierkegaard, is a lived experience, a quest to find one's values, beliefs, and purpose in a meaningless world. As a Christian, Kierkegaard finds his meaning in the Word of God, but for those who are not Christian, Kierkegaard wishes them well in their search.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, S. ''The Essential Kierkegaard'', Eds. Howard and Edna Hong. Princeton, 2000. P. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} However, it is noted that Kierkegaard was not a friend to the church so to claim him as a man of prayer is neglectful. He in fact hated the governance of the church and is religious in the sense that he attempted to understand happiness through his three stages of existence, marking himself on the second stage.

==Sartre==
{{Main|Existence precedes essence}}
"Existence precedes essence" means that humans [[existence|exist]] first before they have meaning in life. Meaning is not given, and must be achieved.
With objects—say a knife for example, there is some creator who conceives of an idea or purpose of an object,  and then creates it with the essence of the object already present. The essence of what the knife will be exists before the actual knife itself. Sartre, who was an [[Atheism|atheist]], believed that if there is no God to have conceived of our essence or nature, then we must come into existence first, and then create our own essence out of interaction with our surroundings and ourselves. With this come serious implications of self-responsibility over who we are and what our lives mean. For this reason, meaning is something without representation or bearing in anything or anyone else. It is something truly unique to each person{{spaced ndash}}separate, independent.&lt;ref&gt;''Existentialism is a humanism'', [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], (L'existentialisme est un humanisme) 1946 Lecture&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frankl==
{{Main|Logotherapy}}
Logotherapy is a type of psychological analysis that focuses on a '''will to meaning''' as opposed to a [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]]'''/'''[[Alfred Adler|Adlerian]] doctrine of "[[will to power]]" or Freud's "[[Pleasure principle (psychology)|will to pleasure]]".&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (June 10, 2009) [https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:FrKYAo88ckkJ:www.materdei.ie/media/conferences/a-secular-age-parallel-sessions-timetable.pdf+%22Stan+Seidner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us "A Trojan Horse: Logotherapeutic Transcendence and its Secular Implications for Theology"]. ''Mater Dei Institute''. p 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Frankl also noted the barriers to humanity's quest for meaning in life. He warns against "...[[affluence]], [[hedonism]], [and] [[Economic materialism|materialism]]..." in the search for meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logotherapyinstitute.org/tenets.html "Tenets"]. [[Logotherapy Institute]].  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324160012/http://www.logotherapyinstitute.org/tenets.html |date=March 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following list of tenets represents Frankl's basic principles of Logotherapy:
{{blockquote|
* Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones.
* Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life.
* We have inalienable freedom to find meaning.
|About Logotherapy&lt;ref name="logotherapy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logotherapyinstitute.org/About_Logotherapy.html|title=Viktor Frankl Institute of Logotherapy|website=www.logotherapyinstitute.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}
We can find meaning in life in three different ways:
{{blockquote|
#by creating a work or doing a deed;
#by experiencing something or encountering someone;
#by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.
|About Logotherapy&lt;ref name="logotherapy" /&gt;}}
Logotherapy was developed by psychiatrist and [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor [[Viktor Frankl]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15357">'''Narcissistic mortification''' is "the primitive terror of self dissolution, triggered by the sudden exposure of one's sense of a defective self ... it is death by [[embarrassment]]".&lt;ref name = Libbey&gt;{{cite web|title=On Narcissistic Mortification|url=http://internationalpsychoanalysis.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/libbeypaper.pdf|author= Mary Libbey|publisher= Paper  presented at the Shame Symposium, New York, March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narcissistic mortification is a term first used by [[Sigmund Freud]] in his last book, ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Moses and Monotheism'' (Standard Ed., 23) p. 74 and p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; with respect to early injuries to the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]/self. The concept has been widely employed in [[ego psychology]] and also contributed to the roots of [[self psychology]].

When narcissistic mortification is experienced for the first time, it may be defined as a sudden loss of control over external or internal reality, or both. This produces strong emotions of terror while at the same time narcissistic [[libido]] (also known as ego-libido) or [[destrudo]] is built up.&lt;ref name=Eidelberg&gt;{{cite web|title=An introduction to the study of the narcissistic mortification|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01568757#page-1|publisher=Psychiatric Quarterly|author=Ludwig Eidelberg}} 1957;31(4):657-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Narcissistic libido or ego-libido is the concentration of libido on the self. Destrudo is the opposite of libido and is the impulse to destroy oneself and everything associated with oneself.

==Early developments: Bergler, Anna Freud, and Eidelberg==
[[Edmund Bergler]] developed the concept of narcissistic mortification in connection with early fantasies of [[omnipotence]] in the developing child, and with the fury provoked by the confrontations with reality that undermine his or her illusions.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Bergler, "The Psychology of Gambling", Jon Halliday/Peter Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; For Bergler, “the narcissistic mortification suffered in this very early period continues to act as a stimulus throughout his life”.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Bergler, ''The Basic Neurosis'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Freud]] used the term in connection with her exploration of the [[defence mechanism]] of altruistic surrender, whereby an individual lives only through the lives of others – seeing at the root of such an abrogation of one's own life an early experience of narcissistic mortification at a disappointment with one's self.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Appignanesi/John Forrester, ''Freud's Women'' (2004) p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoanalyst and author Ludwig Eidelberg subsequently expanded on the concept in the fifties and sixties. Eidelberg defined narcissistic mortification as occurring when “a sudden loss of control over external or internal reality...produces the painful emotional experience of terror”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/u567q2r527731438/ "An introduction to the study of the narcissistic mortification" Psychiatric Quarterly 31]&lt;/ref&gt; He also stressed that for many patients simply to have to accept themselves as having neurotic symptoms was itself a source of narcissistic mortification.&lt;ref&gt;Eidelberg: [http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=paq.029.0582b The Concept of Narcissistic Mortification] Int J Psychoanal. 1959 May-Aug;40:163-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kohut and self psychology==

For Kohut, [[narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury|narcissistic injury]] - the root cause of what he  termed [[narcissistic personality disorder]] – was broadly equivalent to the [[humiliation]] of mortification.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Adamson/Hilary Anne Clark, ''Scenes of Shame'' (1999) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Kohut considered that “if the [[grandiosity]] of the narcissistic self has been insufficiently modified...then the adult ego will tend to vacillate between an irrational overestimation of the self and feelings of inferiority and will react with narcissistic mortification to the thwarting of its ambitions”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Steven J. Ellman, ''When Theories Touch'' (London 2009) p. 464&lt;/ref&gt;

==Object relations theory==
{{Main|Object relations theory}}
Unlike ego psychologists, object relations theorists have traditionally used a rather different, [[Melanie Klein|post-Kleinian]] vocabulary to describe the early woundings of narcissistic mortification. Recently however  such theorists have found analogies between Freud's emphasis on the sensitivity of the ego to narcissistic humiliation and mortification, and the views of [[W. R. Bion|Bion]] on 'nameless dread' or [[D. W. Winnicott|Winnicott]]'s on the original agonies of the breakdown of childhood consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Eigen, ''The Sensitive Self'' (2004) p. 10, 20, and 25&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time ego psychologists have been increasingly prepared to see narcissistic mortification as occurring in the context of early relations to objects.

==Physical sensations and psychological perceptions==
An individual’s experience of mortification may be accompanied by both physical and psychological sensations. Physical sensations such as: burning, painful tingling over the body, pain in the chest that slowly expands and spreads throughout the torso, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, blanching, coldness and numbness can be experienced by the individual suffering from mortification. The psychological sensations described are feeling shocked, exposed, and humiliated. Descriptions of this experience can be, for example: “It feels like I won’t survive” and “I have the absolute conviction that he or she hates me and it’s my fault”. These sensations are always followed by shock, although they may have happened on various occasions, they also prompt the need for the individual suffering to do something both internally and externally, to effect a positive self-image in the eyes of their narcissistic object. Narcissistic mortification is extreme in its intensity, global nature, and its lack of perspective, causing the anxiety associated with it to become traumatic.&lt;ref name = Libbey/&gt;

==Normal versus pathological==
In Eidelberg's view, a normal individual would usually be able to avoid being overwhelmed by internal needs because they recognize these urges in time to bring about their partial discharge. However, Eidelberg does not view occasional outbursts of temper as a sign of disorder. An individual experiencing pathological narcissistic mortification is prone to become fixated on infantile objects, resulting in an infantile form of discharge. He or she cannot be satisfied by the partial discharge of this energy, which takes place on an  unconscious level, and this in turn interferes with their well-being. According to Eidelberg, the denial of an infantile narcissistic mortification can be responsible for many defensive mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Eidelberg /&gt;

===Internal versus external===

Narcissistic mortification can be: 
* '''Internal''' - occurs when an individual is overstimulated by their emotions. For example, while debating with classmates on the importance of stem cell research an outspoken student loses his temper causing an uproar. The student has just exhibited an overstimulation of his emotions and used this outburst to relieve internal tension. 
* '''External''' - occurs when something out of one's control influences a situation, for example, an individual who is held at gunpoint while having their wallet stolen. This individual does not hold any control over the scenario nor the actions of the gunman, but their reaction to being held at gunpoint influences the next scenario and what the gunman does next.&lt;ref name=Eidelberg /&gt;

==In cult leadership==
{{POV-section|date=May 2013}}

To escape the narcissistic mortification of accepting their own dependency needs, [[cult]] leaders may resort to delusions of [[omnipotence]].&lt;ref name="pathological narcissist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shaw|first=Daniel|title=Chris Nemelka - Public Scrutiny|url=http://chrisnemelka.com/the-pathological-narcissist/#more-4828|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their continuing [[shame]] and underlying [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The dark side of enlightenment: sadomasochistic aspects of the quest for perfection|url=http://www.danielshawlcsw.com/dark_side.htm|accessdate=31 March 2013|author=Daniel Shaw|date=22 January 2000|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629000728/http://www.danielshawlcsw.com/dark_side.htm|archivedate=29 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their repudiation of dependency,&lt;ref name="traumatic abuse in cults"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Daniel|title=Traumatic abuse in cults: A psychoanalytic perspective|journal=Cultic Studies Review|year=2003|volume=2|url=http://www.danielshawlcsw.com/traumabusecults.pdf|accessdate=31 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617040314/http://www.danielshawlcsw.com/traumabusecults.pdf|archivedate=17 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; obliges such leaders to use seduction and manic defenses to externalize and locate dependency needs in others, thus making their followers controllable through a displaced sense of shame.

==Death, anxiety, and suicide==

Because in western culture death is sometimes seen as the ultimate loss of control, fear of it may produce death anxiety in the form of a sense of extreme shame or narcissistic mortification.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kauffman ed.,  ''The Shame of Death, Grief and Trauma'' (2010) p. 77-9&lt;/ref&gt; The shame in this context is produced by the loss of stoicism, productivity, and control, aspects that are highly valued by society and aspects that are taken away as one ages. Death according to Darcy Harris, 'is the ultimate narcissistic wound, bringing about not just the annihilation of self, but the annihilation of one's entire existence, resulting in a form of existential shame for human beings, who possess the ability to ponder this dilemma with their higher functioning cognitive abilities.'&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who hold this anxiety are ashamed of mortality and the frailty that comes along with it; and may attempt to overcome this reality through diversions and accomplishments, deflecting feelings of inferiority and shame through strategies like [[grandiosity]] in similar fashion to those with narcissistic personality traits.&lt;ref name="shame of death"&gt;{{cite book|title=The shame of death, grief, and trauma |isbn=0-203-88360-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAn8xnSisJQC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=death+anxiety+and+narcissistic+mortification&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en |editor=Jeffrey Kauffman |accessdate=1 April 2013 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narcissistic mortification may also be produced by death of someone close.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold M. Cooper ed., ''Contemporary Psychoanalysis in America'' (2008) p. 680&lt;/ref&gt; Such a loss of an essential object may even lead through narcissistic mortification to suicide.&lt;ref&gt;F. Alexander et al, ''Psychoanalytic Pioneers'' (1995) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many motives behind suicidal activities in general are shame, loss of honor, and narcissistic mortification.&lt;ref name="suicide and narcissistic mortification"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ritter |first1=Kristina |last2=Chaudhry |first2=Haroon |last3=Erhabor |first3=Idemudia |last4=Karakula |first4=Hanna |last5=Okribelashvili |first5=Ninõ |last6=Rudaleviciene |first6=Palmira |last7=Stompe |first7=Thomas |title=Suicide motives and culture |journal=Official Journal of World Association of Cultural Psychiatry |year=2008 |url=http://www.wcprr.org/pdf/03-02/2008.02.6976.pdf |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who suffer from narcissistic mortification are more likely to participate in suicidal behaviors and those who do not receive the proper help more often than not succeed. Suicide related to narcissistic mortification is different from  normal sorrow in that it is associated with deep rooted self-contempt and self-hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, M. M. (1958). Zur Psychologie des Selbstmordes. Acta Psychotherapeutica, Psychosomatica Et Orthopaedagogica, 6317-326. doi:10.1159/000285354&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
According to a paper presented by Mary Libbey, "On Narcissistic Mortification", presented at the 2006 Shame Symposium, long-term goal of psychoanalytic treatment for those who suffer from narcissistic mortification is to transform the mortification into shame. She says by transforming it into shame it enables the sufferer to tolerate and use it as a signal; the process of transforming mortification into shame entails working through both the early mortifying traumas as well as the defenses, often unstable, related to them. If an individual sufferer does not go through this transformation, he or she is left with two unstable narcissistic defenses. Libbey says these defenses are: self-damning, deflated states designed to appease and hold on to self-objects, and narcissistic conceit, which is designed to project the defective self experiences onto self-objects. Both of these defensive styles require a continuation of dependence on the self-object. Transforming the mortification into shame makes it possible for self-appraisal and self-tolerance, this ultimately leads to psychic separation and self-reliance without the need to sustain one's mortification, according to Libbey's paper.&lt;ref name = Libbey/&gt;

==In the 21st century==

Postmodern Freudians link narcissistic mortification to Winnicott's theory of primitive mental states which lack the capacity for symbolisation, and their need for re-integration.&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Druck et al eds., ''A New Freudian Synthesis'' (2011) p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Returning in the transference to the intolerable mortification underpinning such [[narcissistic defences]] can however also produce positive analytic change, by way of the (albeit mortifying) re-experience of overwhelming object loss within an intersubjective holding environment.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Druck, ''A Freudian Synthesis'' (London 2010) p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

21st century American analysts are particularly concerned with the potential production of narcissistic mortification as a by-product of analytic interpretation, especially with regard to [[masochistic personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold M. Cooper ed., ''Contemporary Psychoanalysis in America'' (2008) p. 505 and p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary uses==

Narcissistic mortification at injuries to [[self-esteem]] has been seen as pervading Captain Ahab's motivations in his confrontation with [[Moby-Dick]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Adamson, ''Melville, Shame, and the Evil Eye'' (1997) p. 74-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortification at one's self is seen in Mary Shelley's [[Frankenstein]] when the Creature stares at his reflection in a pool of water. This is where he becomes convinced that he is in fact the Creature and becomes filled with despondence and mortification.&lt;ref name=Frankenstein&gt;{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Jeffrey|title=Frankenstein; or, the Modern Narcissus|url=http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Articles/berman.html|publisher=New York University|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12821">'''Negative thermal expansion''' (NTE) is an unusual [[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] process in which some materials contract upon heating, rather than expand as most other materials do. Materials which undergo NTE have a range of potential [[engineering]], [[photonics|photonic]], [[Electronics|electronic]], and [[structural]] applications. For example, if one were to mix a '''negative thermal expansion''' material with a "normal" material which expands on heating, it could be possible to make a zero expansion [[composite material]].

== Origin of negative thermal expansion ==

There are a number of physical processes which may cause contraction with increasing temperature, including transverse vibrational modes, [[Rigid Unit Modes]] and [[phase transitions]].

Recently, Liu et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2011.07.001|title=Origin of negative thermal expansion phenomenon in solids|year=2011|last1=Liu|first1=Zi-Kui|last2=Wang|first2=Yi|last3=Shang|first3=Shun-Li|journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=65|issue=8|pages=664–667}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the NTE phenomenon originates from the existence of high pressure, small volume configurations with higher entropy, with their configurations present in the stable phase matrix through thermal fluctuations. They were able to predict both the colossal positive thermal expansion (In cerium) and zero and infinite negative thermal expansion (in {{chem|Fe|3|Pt}}) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep07043|pmid=25391631|pmc=4229665|title=Thermal Expansion Anomaly Regulated by Entropy|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=4|pages=7043|year=2014|last1=Liu|first1=Zi-Kui|last2=Wang|first2=Yi|last3=Shang|first3=Shunli|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E7043L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative thermal expansion in close-packed systems ==

Negative thermal expansion is usually observed in non-close-packed systems with directional interactions (e.g. [[ice]], [[graphene]], etc.) and complex compounds (e.g. {{Chem|Cu|2|O}}, {{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}, beta-quartz, some zeolites, etc.). However, in a paper,&lt;ref name=Rechtsman&gt;{{Citation

The following sufficient condition for potential giving rise to NTE behavior is proposed:

&lt;math&gt;
    \Pi'''(a) &gt;  0,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Pi &lt;/math&gt; is pair [[interatomic potential]], &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium distance. This condition is (i) necessary and sufficient in 1D and (ii) sufficient, but not necessary in 2D and 3D. ''An approximate'' necessary and sufficient condition is derived in a paper&lt;ref name=Kuzkin&gt;{{Citation
 | title = Comment on 'Negative Thermal Expansion in Single-Component Systems with Isotropic Interactions'
 | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry A
 | volume = 118

&lt;math&gt;
    \Pi'''(a)a &gt; -(d-1)\Pi''(a),
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; is the space dimensionality. Thus in 2D and 3D negative thermal expansion in close-packed systems with pair interactions is realized even when the third derivative of the potential is zero or even negative. Note that one-dimensional and multidimensional cases are qualitatively different. In 1D thermal expansion is cased by anharmonicity of [[interatomic potential]] only. Therefore, the sign of thermal expansion coefficient is determined by the sign of the third derivative of the potential. In multidimensional case the geometrical nonlinearity is also present, i.e. lattice vibrations are nonlinear even in the case of harmonic interatomic potential. This nonlinearity contributes to thermal expansion. Therefore, in multidimensional case both &lt;math&gt;\Pi''&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi'''&lt;/math&gt; are present in the condition for negative thermal expansion.

== Applications ==

There are many potential applications for materials with controlled thermal expansion properties, as thermal expansion causes many problems in engineering, and indeed in everyday life. One simple example of a thermal expansion problem is the tendency of [[dental fillings]] to expand by an amount different from the [[teeth]], for example when drinking a hot drink, causing [[toothache]]. If dental fillings were made of a [[composite material]] containing a mixture of materials with positive and negative thermal expansion then the overall expansion could be precisely tailored to that of [[tooth enamel]].

== Materials ==

Perhaps one of the most studied materials to exhibit ''negative thermal expansion'' is '''[[zirconium tungstate]]''' ({{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}). This compound contracts continuously over a temperature range of 0.3 to 1050 K (at higher temperatures the material decomposes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Negative Thermal Expansion from 0.3 to 1050 Kelvin in {{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}|journal=Science|year=1996|volume=272|issue=5258|pages=90–92|doi= 10.1126/science.272.5258.90|bibcode = 1996Sci...272...90M|last1=Mary|first1=T. A.|last2=Evans|first2=J. S. O.|last3=Vogt|first3=T.|last4=Sleight|first4=A. W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other materials that exhibit this behaviour include: other members of the {{chem|A|M|2|O|8}} family of materials (where A = {{chem|Zr}} or {{chem|Hf}}, M = {{chem|Mo}} or {{chem|W}}) and {{chem|Zr|V|2|O|7}}. {{chem|A|2|({{Chem|M|O|4}})|3}} also is an example of controllable ''negative thermal expansion''.

Ordinary ice shows NTE in its hexagonal and cubic phases at very low temperatures (below –200&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=ice_NTE&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0108768194004933|title=Lattice constants and thermal expansion of {{Chem|H|2|O}} and {{Chem|D|2|O}} ice Ih between 10 and 265 K|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section B|year=1994|volume= 50|pages=644–648|issue=6|last1=Röttger|first1=K.|last2=Endriss|first2=A.|last3=Ihringer|first3=J.|last4=Doyle|first4=S.|last5=Kuhs|first5=W. F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its liquid form, pure [[water]] also displays negative thermal expansivity below 3.984&amp;nbsp;°C.

[[Rubber elasticity]] shows NTE at normal temperatures, but the reason for the effect is rather different from that in most other materials. Put simply, as the long polymer chains absorb energy, they adopt a more contorted configuration, reducing the volume of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeleyphysicsdemos.net/node/344 |title=Heating a rubber band: negative coefficient of thermal expansion &amp;#124; Lecture Demonstrations |publisher=Berkeleyphysicsdemos.net |date= |accessdate=2015-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quartz ({{chem|Si|O|2}}) and a number of zeolites also show NTE over certain temperature ranges.&lt;ref name=zeolite1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/b002950p|title=The widespread occurrence of negative thermal expansion in zeolites|journal= Journal of Materials Chemistry|year= 2001|volume= 11|pages=212–216|last1=Lightfoot|first1=Philip|last2=Woodcock|first2=David A.|last3=Maple|first3=Martin J.|last4=Villaescusa|first4=Luis A.|last5=Wright|first5=Paul A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zeolite2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Attfield|first1=Martin P.|title=Strong negative thermal expansion in siliceous faujasite|journal= Chemical Communications|year=1998|pages=601–602|doi=10.1039/A707141H|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairly pure silicon (Si) has a negative coefficient of thermal expansion for temperatures between about 18 K and 120 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first = William C. |editor1-last= O'Mara |editor2-first = Robert B. |editor2-last=Herring | editor3-first = Lee P. |editor3-last=Hunt

Cubic [[Scandium trifluoride]] has this property which is explained by the quartic oscillation of the fluoride ions. The energy stored in the bending strain of the fluoride ion is proportional to the fourth power of the displacement angle, unlike most other materials where it is proportional to the square of the displacement. A fluorine atom is bound to two scandium atoms, and as temperature increases the fluorine oscillates more perpendicularly to its bonds. This draws the scandium atoms together throughout the material and it contracts.&lt;ref name="woo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-11-incredible-material-reveal-scandium-trifluoride.html|title=An incredible shrinking material: Engineers reveal how scandium trifluoride contracts with heat|last=Woo|first=Marcus|date=7 November 2011|publisher=Physorg|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{chem|Sc|F|3}} exhibits this property from 10 to 1100 K above which it shows the normal positive thermal expansion.&lt;ref name="greve"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greve|first=Benjamin K.|author2=Kenneth L.

{{Politics|expanded=Policy}}

'''Public interest''' is "the [[welfare]] or [[well-being]] of the [[general public]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/public+interest "Public interest"], ''[[Random House Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Economist Lok Sang Ho in his ''Public Policy and the Public Interest''&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, 2012 (first published published in 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the public interest must be assessed impartially and, therefore, defines the public interest as the "''[[ex ante]]'' welfare of the representative individual." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415664660/ Ho, Lok Sang, Public Policy and the Public Interest, Routledge, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[thought experiment]], by assuming that there is an equal chance for one to be anyone in society and, thus, could benefit or suffer from a change, the public interest is by definition enhanced whenever that change is preferred to the status quo ''ex ante''. This approach is "''ex ante''", in the sense that the change is not evaluated after the fact but assessed before the fact without knowing whether one would actually benefit or suffer from it.

This approach follows the "[[veil of ignorance]]" approach, which was first proposed by [[John Harsanyi]] but popularized by [[John Rawls]] in his 1971 ''Theory of Justice''.&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, John (1971) ''A Theory of Justice'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, however, the approach can be traced to [[John Stuart Mill]], who, in his letter to [[George Grote]], explained that "human happiness, even one's own, is in general more successfully pursued by acting on general rules, than by measuring the consequences of each act; and this is still more the case with the general happiness, since any other plan would not only leave everybody uncertain what to expect, but would involve perpetual quarrelling..."&lt;ref&gt;Francis E. Mineka and Dwight N. Lindley (ed.), ''The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume XIV - The Later Letters of John Stuart Mill 1849-1873 Part I, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1972, Vol. XV, p.&amp;nbsp;762, 1862.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] argues that applying a detailed definition is likely to result in [[unintended consequences]], in [http://www.icaew.com/publicinterest Acting in the Public Interest](2012). Instead, each circumstance needs to be assessed based on criteria such as the relevant public, wants, and constraints. The key to assessing any public interest decision is transparency of the decision-making process, including balancing competing interests.

==Law==
{{main|Public interest law}}
[[File:Brandeis office 1916.jpg|thumb|Brandeis (center) in his office 1916.]]
“Public interest law” is a term that became widely adopted in the United States during and after the social turmoil of the 1960s. It built upon a tradition exemplified by [[Louis Brandeis]], who before becoming a U.S. Supreme Court justice incorporated advocacy for the interests of the general public into his legal practice. 
In a celebrated 1905 speech, Brandeis decried the legal profession, complaining that “able lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their obligation to use their powers for the protection of the people.” &lt;ref&gt;Edwin Rekosh, et al.,ed. "Pursuing the Public Interest, A Handbook for Legal Professionals and Activists" (http://www.pilnet.org/component/docman/doc_download/35-pursuing-the-public-interest-a-handbook-for-legal.html); Scott L. Cummings, The Politics of Pro Bono, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 13-14(2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of American law school graduates began to seek “relevance” in their work — wishing to have an effect on the social issues that were so visibly and hotly debated within American society at that time. They defined themselves as public interest lawyers in order to distinguish themselves from the “corporate adjuncts” referred to by Brandeis.&lt;ref&gt;Rekosh, supra; See also Joel F. Handler, Ellen Jane Hollingsworth &amp; Howard S. Erlanger, Lawyers and the Pursuit of Legal Rights 24-39 (1978); Note, The New Public Interest lawyers, 79 Yale L.J. 1069, 1069-70 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

Public interest law does not describe a body of law or a legal field; the term was adopted to describe whom the public interest lawyers were representing, rather than what matters they would work on. Instead of representing powerful economic interests, they chose to be advocates for otherwise underrepresented individuals. Consequently, a significant current in public interest lawyering has always emphasized the need to provide legal services to those living in poverty. The term has grown, however, to encompass a broader range of activities of lawyers and non-lawyers working toward a multitude of objectives, including civil rights, civil liberties, women’s rights, consumer rights, environmental protection, and so on. Nevertheless, a common denominator for public interest lawyers in the United States and in a growing number of countries remains the ethic of “fighting for the little guy”—that is, representing the underrepresented and vulnerable segments of society.&lt;ref name=Cummings&gt;Scott L. Cummings &amp; Ingrid V. Eagly, After Public Interest Law, NWU L. Rev. 1251, 1251-1259, 2075-2077(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

{{globalize|date=February 2017}}

Public interest has been considered as the core of "[[democratic theories of government]]” and often paired with two other concepts, "[[convenience]]" and "[[Need|necessity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Napoli, Philip M. (2001). Foundations of Communications Policy. Principles and Process in the Regulation of Electronic Media. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press&lt;/ref&gt; Public interest, convenience and necessity appeared for the first time in the Transportation Act of 1920 and also appeared in the [[Radio Act of 1927]]. After that, these three concepts became critical criteria for making communication policies and solving some related disputes.

[[File:Red and blue pill.jpg|thumb|A red pill and a blue pill]]
{{wiktionary|red piller}}

The '''red pill''' and its opposite, the '''blue pill''', are a popular cultural [[meme]], a metaphor representing the choice between: 
*[[Knowledge]], [[freedom]], [[uncertainty]] and the brutal [[truth]]s of [[reality]] (red pill) 
*[[Security]], [[happiness]], [[beauty]], and the [[blissful ignorance effect|blissful ignorance]] of [[illusion]] (blue pill) 

The terms, popularized in [[science fiction]] culture, are directly derived from the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]''. However, it is speculated that the scriptwriters may have borrowed the idea from the 1865 [[Lewis Carroll]]'s novel ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'', in which the central character has a choice to drink or eat potions to enable her adventure to continue. In the Matrix, the main character [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] is offered the choice between a red pill and a blue pill by rebel leader [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]]. The red pill represented an uncertain future—it would free him from the enslaving control of the machine-generated [[dream world (plot device)|dream world]] and allow him to escape into the real world, but living the "truth of reality" is harsher and more difficult. On the other hand, the blue pill represented a beautiful [[prison]]—it would lead him back to ignorance, living in confined comfort without want or fear within the [[simulated reality]] of the Matrix.

===Background: draft lottery (1969)===
{{main|Draft lottery (1969)#Method}}
On December 1, 1969 the [[Selective Service System]] of the United States conducted two lotteries to determine the order of call to military service in the [[Vietnam War]] for men born from January 1, 1944 to December 31, 1950. The 366 days of the year (including February 29) were printed on slips of paper. These pieces of paper were then each placed in opaque blue plastic capsules that resembled large blue pills. The blue pills were then mixed in a shoebox and then dumped into a deep glass jar. The blue pills were then drawn from the jar one at a time and opened. The order that each birthdate was drawn signified the draft order for that birthdate. From this first draft lottery, 195 birth dates were selected to serve in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Selective Service System |url=http://www.sss.gov/LOTTER8.HTM |title=1970 Draft Lottery Results drawn December 1, 1969 sorted by date |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915232321/http://www.sss.gov/LOTTER8.HTM |archivedate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Gödel, Escher, Bach'' (1979)===
[[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' features a pair of characters who "push-into" and "pop-out of" the two-dimensional world of [[M. C. Escher|Escher]] prints. The way they do this is to drink from a blue or a red phial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Douglas Hofstadter – Little Harmonic Labyrinth |url=https://genius.com/Douglas-hofstadter-little-harmonic-labyrinth-annotated |work=''[[Genius (website)|Genius]]'' |location=New York City |accessdate=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofstadter2000_116"&gt;{{cite book |author=Douglas R. Hofstadter |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach.

Hofstadter cites [[Lewis Carroll]] as a strong influence on the book (the front cover of the book has a line that says that the book is "in the spirit of Lewis Carroll".) The "push-into" and "pop-out of" phials are reminiscent of the ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' "drink me" and "eat me" potion and cake, which cause Alice to shrink and grow.

===''Total Recall'' (1990)===
The [[science fiction]] film ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990) features a red pill which is offered to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s character, Douglas Quaid, by one Dr. Edgemar. He is told "it's a symbol, of your desire to return to reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parker |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Parker (psychologist) |title=Psychology, Science Fiction and Postmodern Space |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/008124639602600303 |journal=South African Journal of Psychology |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]] |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]] |date=September 1996 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=143−149 |doi=10.1177/008124639602600303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[YouTube]] |title=''Total Recall'' - The Red Pill |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWfh0OuTKKE |date=April 20, 2012 |accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; No blue pill is present in the film, and the story centers on the uncertainty of whether Quaid is dreaming or in the real world. However, the pill is offered to him with the claim that he {{em|is}} dreaming, and that the pill will return him to reality, with the words "inside your dream, you'll fall asleep."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Ian |title=Psychoanalytic Culture.

The implication is that if the dream is not a dream but reality, Dr. Edgemar is part of the conspiracy against Quaid, and the pill is simply poison. He had also told Quaid that if Quaid killed him, "the walls of reality will come crashing down"; moments after his death, the walls of the hotel room literally come crashing down.&lt;ref name="Killing the Bearer of the Red Pill"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100802/trivia?item=tr0742282 |title=Total Recall Spoilers |publisher=[[IMDb]] | accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{UGC|date=March 2018}}

===''The Matrix'' (1999)===
{{see also|Influences and interpretations of The Matrix}}

''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999), directed by [[The Wachowskis]], makes references to historical myths and philosophy, including [[gnosticism]], [[existentialism]], and [[nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/24/arts/24MATR.html|title=Philosophers Draw on the Film 'Matrix'|first=Edward|last=Rothstein|date=May 24, 2003|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/gnostic.htm|title=Journal of Religion &amp; Film: Wake Up!

Japanese director [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' was a strong influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Matrix Virtual Theatre'' (interview with the Wachowskis)| publisher=''[[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Studios]]'', Official Website | url=http://www.warnervideo.com/matrixevents/wachowski.html |date=1999-11-06| accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Matrix'', [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] ([[Keanu Reeves]]) hears rumors of the Matrix and a mysterious man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]]. Neo spends his nights at his home computer trying to discover the secret of the Matrix and what the Matrix is. Eventually, another hacker, [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]), introduces Neo to Morpheus.

Morpheus ([[Laurence Fishburne]]) explains to Neo that the Matrix is an illusory world created to prevent humans from discovering that they are slaves to an external influence. Holding out a capsule on each of his palms, he describes the choice facing Neo:

{{quotation|This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the {{em|red}} pill—you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.}}

As narrated, the blue pill will allow the subject to remain in the fabricated reality of the Matrix; the red serves as a "location device" to locate the subject's body in the real world and to prepare him or her to be "unplugged" from the Matrix. Once one chooses the red or blue pill, the choice is irrevocable.

Neo takes the red pill and awakens in the real world, where he is forcibly ejected from the liquid-filled chamber in which he has been lying unconscious. After his rescue and convalescence aboard Morpheus's ship, Morpheus shows him the true nature of the Matrix: a detailed computer simulation of Earth at the end of the 20th century (the actual year, though not known for sure, is approximately two hundred years later). It has been created to keep the minds of humans docile while their bodies are stored in massive power plants, their body heat and [[bioelectricity]] consumed as power by the sentient machines that have enslaved them.

In a 2012 interview, [[The Wachowskis|Lana Wachowski]] said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviecitynews.com/2012/10/dp30-cloud-atlas-screenwriterdirectors-lana-wachowski-tom-tykwer-andy-wachowski/|title=DP/30: Cloud Atlas, Screenwriter/Directors Lana Wachowski, Tom Tykwer, Andy Wachowski|at=18:49|last=Poland|first=David|publisher=moviecitynews.com|date=October 13, 2012|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|source=Lana Wachowski, ''Movie City News'', October 13, 2012|quote=What we were trying to achieve with the story overall was a shift, the same kind of shift that happens for Neo, that Neo goes from being in this sort of cocooned and programmed world, to having to participate in the construction of meaning to his life. And we're like, "Well, can the audience go through the three movies and experience something similar to what the main character experiences?" So the first movie is sort of classical in its approach. The second movie is deconstructionist, and it assaults all of the things that you thought to be true in the first movie, and so people get very upset, and they're like "Stop attacking me!" in the same way that people get upset with deconstructionist philosophy. I mean, Derrida and Foucault, these people upset us. And then the third movie is the most ambiguous, because it asks you to actually participate in the construction of meaning...}}

==Analysis==
An essay written by [[Russell Blackford]] discusses the red and blue pills, questioning whether if a person were fully informed they would take the red pill, opting for the real world, believing that the choice of physical reality over a digital simulation is not so beneficial as to be valid for all people. Both Neo and another character, Cypher ([[Joe Pantoliano]]), take the red pill over the blue pill, though later in the first ''Matrix'' film, the latter demonstrates regret for having made that choice, saying that if Morpheus fully informed him of the situation, Cypher would have told him to "shove the red pill right up [his] ass." When Cypher subsequently makes a deal with the machines to return to the Matrix and forget everything he had learned, he says, "Ignorance is bliss." Blackford argues that the ''Matrix'' films set things up so that even if Neo fails, the taking of the red pill is worthwhile because he lives and dies authentically. Blackford and science-fiction writer [[James Patrick Kelly]] feel that ''The Matrix'' stacks the deck against machines and their simulated world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vX7HCkNTv0wC&amp;pg=PA169|title=Jacking in to the Matrix franchise: cultural reception and interpretation|isbn=978-0-8264-1588-2|author1=Kapell, Matthew|author2=Doty, William G|date=2004-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Matrix Warrior: Being the One'' author [[Jason Horsley|Jake Horsley]] compared the red pill to [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], citing a scene where Neo forms his own world outside of the Matrix. When he asks Morpheus if he could return, Morpheus responds by asking him if he would want to. Horsley also describes the blue pill as [[addiction|addictive]], calling ''The Matrix'' series a continuous series of choices between taking the blue pill and not taking it. He adds that the habits and routines of people inside the Matrix are merely the people dosing themselves with the blue pill. While he describes the blue pill as a common thing, he states that the red pill is one of a kind, and something someone may not even find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-FfxGSgdnsC&amp;pg=PA125|title=Matrix Warrior: Being the One|isbn=978-0-312-32264-9|author1=Horsley, Jake|date=2003-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''[[The Art of the Start]]'', author Guy Kawasaki uses the red pill as an analogue to the situation of leaders of new organizations, in that they face the same choice to either live in reality or fantasy. He adds that if they want to be successful, they have to take the red pill and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-gXlwJnnNoEC&amp;pg=PA92|title=The art of the start: the time-tested, battle-hardened guide for anyone starting anything|isbn=978-1-59184-056-5|author1=Kawasaki, Guy|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Blue Pill (software)|Blue Pill]] [[rootkit]] ("[[malware]]")—named in reference to the pill as are the Red Pill techniques used to combat it—is a special type of software that utilizes the virtualization techniques of modern [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs) to execute as a [[hypervisor]]; as a virtual platform on which the entire operating system runs, it is capable of examining the entire state of the machine and to cause any behavior with full privilege, while the operating system "believes" itself to be running directly on physical hardware, creating a parallel to the illusory Matrix. Blue Pill describes the concept of infecting a machine while Red Pill techniques help the operating system to detect the presence of such a hypervisor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joanna Rutkowska]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070911024318/http://invisiblethings.org/papers/redpill.html "Red Pill... or how to detect VMM using (almost) one CPU instruction"] (archive), Invisible Things Lab&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts were described by [[Joanna Rutkowska]] in 2006.
* In cybersecurity, a red pill is any means of detecting [[hooking]] or [[virtualization]]. It is frequently used by [[anti-cheat]], [[antirootkit]] software, [[malware]], and [[digital rights management]], etc. Red pills usually make use of [[real-time clock]]s to measure the time it takes for [[Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements#Virtualization theorems|critical operations]] and interactions with peripheral hardware to occur, and compare the length of them with the expected length of such operations as they occur without virtualization. If the clock is compromised, the hypervisor can hide its presence by slowing the clock down in a controlled way, to hide the extra time imposed by virtualization. 
* Until they were removed from the [[Maemo]] operating system application installer in January 2010, certain advanced features were unlocked by a "Red Pill Mode" [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] to prevent accidental use by novice users but make them readily available to experienced users. This was activated by starting to add a catalog whose URL was "matrix" and then choosing to cancel. A dialog box would appear asking "Which pill?" with the choices "Red" or "Blue", allowing the user to enter red pill mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.maemo.org/index.php?title=Red_Pill_mode&amp;oldid=26816|title=Red Pill mode|work=maemo.org wiki|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mxr.maemo.org/fremantle/source/hildon-application-manager/src/repo.cc#153|title=src/repo.cc|work=hildon-application-manager|at=Line 153|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Red Pill" mode, the installer allows the user to view and reconfigure system packages whose existence it normally does not acknowledge. In Blue Pill mode the installer displays only software installed by a user, creating the illusion that system software does not exist on the system.
* The choice between taking a blue or red pill is a central metaphor in the 2011 [[Arte]] documentary film ''[[Marx Reloaded]]'', in which philosophers including [[Slavoj Žižek]] and [[Nina Power]] explore solutions to the global [[Great Recession|economic and financial crisis of 2008–09]]. The film also contains an animated parody of the red/blue pill scene in ''The Matrix'', with [[Leon Trotsky]] as Morpheus and [[Karl Marx]] as Neo.&lt;ref name="Marx Reloaded"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybvsZ7YjBL0 | title=Marx Reloaded trailer  | accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  In some parts of the [[men's rights movement]], the term "red pill" has been used as a metaphor for the specific moment when they come to the belief that certain gender roles they are expected to conform to, such as marriage and monogamy, are intended to benefit women, not themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.theweek.co.uk/people/62607/mens-rights-movement-why-it-is-so-controversial |title=Men's rights movement: why it is so controversial? |work= The Week |date= February 19, 2015 |accessdate= April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.gq.com/news-politics/big-issues/201503/mens-rights-activism-the-red-pill?currentPage=1|title= Are You Man Enough for the Men's Rights Movement?|last= Sharlet |first= Jeff|work= GQ |date= March 2015|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a documentary titled ''[[The Red Pill]]'' was released, which deals with the men's rights movement.

'''Rigo 23''' (born '''Ricardo Gouveia''', 1966) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[muralist]], [[Painting|painter]], and political artist residing in [[San Francisco, California]]. He is known in the San Francisco community for having painted a number of large, graphic "sign" murals including: ''[http://foundsf.org/images/0/09/Rigo_one-tree.jpg One Tree]'' next to the [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] on-ramp at 10th and Bryant Street, ''[http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=File:Art1$innercity-home.jpg Innercity Home]'' on a large public housing structure, ''[http://www.billyverse.com/x/sky_ground.html Sky/Ground]'' on a tall abandoned building at 3rd and [[Mission Street]], and ''[http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=File:Rigo_extinct.jpg Extinct]'' over a Shell gas station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cometmagazine.org/cometsite4/cometsite3/rigo.html|title=Walls with Tongues: Muralist RIGO 02 Speaks|last=Fleming|first=Siobhan|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Early life and education==
Rigo was born and raised on the island of [[Madeira]]. He later established himself as an artist in San Francisco, earning a BFA from [[San Francisco Art Institute]] in 1991 and an MFA from [[Stanford University]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="comet"&gt;[http://www.cometmagazine.com/cometsite4/cometsite3/rigo.html "Walls with Tongues: Muralist RIGO 02 Speaks"] by Siobhan Fleming, ''Comet Magazine'' 3, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Career==
From 1984-2002, Rigo used the last two digits of the current year as part of his name, finally settling upon "23" in 2003.&lt;ref name="comet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kpfk"&gt;[http://www.kpfk.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1310&amp;Itemid=79&amp;lang=en Calendar item for 'Jam Sessions: Rigo 84–23'], "Another World is Possible" (radio show) website, ''[[KPFK]].com'', January 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of Rigo's work more literally highlights world politics and political prisoners from the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]] and the [[Angola Three]] to [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]], whose conviction for the murder of a policeman is contested, and the [[American Indian Movement]]'s [[Leonard Peltier]]. Rigo create a controversial [[Statue of Leonard Peltier|statue of Peltier]] that was removed from the grounds of the [[American University]] in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/01/04/anger-at-a-cop-killer-a-plea-for-clemency-and-a-fight-over-free-expression-at-au/?tid=hybrid_collaborative_1_na&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.american.edu/cas/museum/upload/AU-Peltier.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, he created a statue based on the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute]] titled ''Victory Salute'', a twenty-two foot tall monument of two men: [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]]. In the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympic Games]] in [[Mexico City]], these men each raised a black-gloved fist for human rights. Their simple gesture of the hand is considered as one of the most controversial statements of political and social activism in Olympic history. ''Victory Salute'' is a monument of that moment which was specifically built on the [[San Jose State University]] campus because Smith and Carlos were both student-athletes at the college.

Rigo is one of the founding members of [http://www.meganwilson.com/related/clarion.php Clarion Alley Mural Project] collective and is still an active member, as of 2006, as well as an occasional professor at The San Francisco Art Institute.&lt;ref name="comet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clarion"&gt;[http://www.meganwilson.com/related/clarion.php "Clarion Alley Mural Project"] by Megan Wilson, ''MeganWilson.com'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
He has also designed several installations as part of the 2006 Liverpool Biennial.&lt;ref name="biennial"&gt;[http://www.biennial.com/corporate/archive/2006/content/Programme/ArtistDirectory/article_35_108.html "Rigo 23"].

'''Rostow's Stages of Economic Growth''' model is one of the major historical models of [[economic growth]]. It was published by American economist [[Walt Whitman Rostow]] in 1960. The model postulates that economic growth occurs in five basic stages, of varying length:&lt;ref name="mth"/&gt;

# Traditional society
# Transitional society 
# Take-off
# Drive to technological maturity
# High mass consumption 

Rostow's model is one of the more [[structuralism|structuralist]] models of economic growth, particularly in comparison with the "[[backwardness]]" model developed by [[Alexander Gerschenkron]], although the two models are not mutually exclusive.

Rostow argued that economic take-off must initially be led by a few individual [[economic sector]]s. This belief echoes [[David Ricardo]]'s [[comparative advantage]] thesis and criticizes [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionaries' push for economic self-reliance in that it pushes for the "initial" development of only one or two sectors over the development of all sectors equally. This became one of the important concepts in the [[theory of modernization]] in [[social evolutionism]].

== Overview ==

Below is an outline of Rostow's Five Stages of Growth:
* '''Traditional Society'''
** characterized by subsistence agriculture or [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]]; almost wholly a "primary" sector economy
** limited technology
** Some advancements and improvements to processes, but limited ability for economic growth because of the absence of modern technologies, lack of class or individual economic mobility, with stability prioritized and change seen negatively 
** This is where society generally begins before progressing towards the next stages of growth
** No centralized nations or political systems.
* '''Pre-conditions to "take-off"'''
** External demand for raw materials initiates economic change.
** Development of more productive, commercial agriculture and cash crops not consumed by producers and/or largely exported.
** Widespread and enhanced investment in changes to the physical environment to expand production (i.e. irrigation, canals, ports)
** Increasing spread of technology and advances in existing technologies
** Changing social structure, with previous social equilibrium now in flux
** Individual social mobility begins
** Development of national identity and shared economic interests.
*'''Take-off'''
** Urbanization increases, industrialization proceeds, technological breakthroughs occur.
** "Secondary" (goods-producing) sector expands and ratio of secondary vs. primary sectors in the economy shifts quickly towards secondary.
** Textiles and apparel are usually the first "take-off" industry, as happened in Great Britain's classic "[[Industrial Revolution]]"
** An Example of the Take-off phase is the Agriculture (Green) Revolution in the 1960s.
* '''Drive to Maturity'''
** Diversification of the industrial base; multiple industries expand and new ones take root quickly
** Manufacturing shifts from investment-driven (capital goods) towards consumer durables and domestic consumption
** Rapid development of transportation infrastructure.
** Large-scale investment in social infrastructure (schools, universities, hospitals, etc.)
* '''Age of Mass Consumption'''
** the industrial base dominates the economy; the primary sector is of greatly diminished weight in economy and society
** widespread and normative consumption of high-value consumer goods (e.g. automobiles)
** consumers typically (if not universally), have disposable income, beyond all basic needs, for additional goods
** Urban society (a movement away from rural countrysides to the cities)
*'''Beyond consumption'''
**age of diminishing relative marginal utility as well as an age for durable consumer goods
**large families and Americans feel as if they were born into a society that has high economic security and high consumption 
**a stage where its merely speculation on whether there is further consumer diffusion or what the new generation will bring for growth

Rostow claimed that these stages of growth were designed to tackle a number of issues, some of which he identified himself, writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Under what impulses did traditional, agricultural societies begin the process of their modernization? When and how did regular growth become a built-in feature of each society? What forces drove the process of sustained growth along and determined its contours? What common social and political features of the growth process may be discerned at each stage? What forces have determined relations between the more developed and less developed areas; and what relation if any did the relative sequence of growth bear to outbreak of war? And finally where is compound interest taking us? Is it taking us to communism; or to the affluent suburbs, nicely rounded out with social overhead capital; to destruction; to the moon; or where?"&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Rostow asserts that countries go through each of these stages fairly linearly, and set out a number of conditions that were likely to occur in [[investment]], [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], and social trends at each state. Not all of the conditions were certain to occur at each stage, however, and the stages and transition periods may occur at varying lengths from country to country, and even from region to region.&lt;ref&gt;Rostow emphasizes in ''Stages'' that "the stages of growth are an arbitrary and limited way of looking at the sequence of modern history: ... to dramatize not merely the uniformities in the sequence of modernization but also—and equally—the uniqueness of each nation's experience."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical Framework ==

Rostow's model is a part of the [[liberal economics|liberal school of economics]], laying emphasis on the efficacy of modern concepts of [[free trade]] and the ideas of [[Adam Smith]]. It disagrees with [[Friedrich List]]'s argument which states that economies which rely on exports of raw materials may get "locked in", and would not be able to diversify, regarding this Rostow's model states that economies may need to depend on raw material exports to finance the development of industrial sector which has not yet of achieved superior level of competitiveness in the early stages of take-off. Rostow's model does not disagree with [[John Maynard Keynes]] regarding the importance of government control over domestic development which is not generally accepted by some ardent free trade advocates. The basic assumption given by Rostow is that countries want to modernize and grow and that society will agree to the [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] norms of economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewishistoricalsociety.com/wiki/tiki-print_article.php?articleId=66 |title=Rostow's Stages of Development vs. Self- Sufficiency |publisher=Lewis historical society |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stages of Development Process ==

=== Traditional Societies ===

An economy in this stage has an unlimited production function which barely attains the minimum level of potential output.  This does not entirely mean that the economy's production level is static.  The output level can still be increased, as there was often a surplus of uncultivated land which can be used for increasing agricultural production. Modern science and technology has yet to be introduced. As a result, these pre-Newtonian societies, unaware of the possibilities to manipulate the external world, rely heavily on manual labor and self-sufficiency to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto|last=Rostow|first=W. W.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; States and individuals utilize irrigation systems in many instances, but most farming is still purely for subsistence.  There have been technological innovations, but only on ad hoc basis. All of that this can result in increases in output, but never beyond an upper limit which cannot be crossed. Trade is predominantly regional and local, largely done through barter, and the monetary system is not well developed.  Investment's share never exceeds 5% of total economic production.

Wars, famines and epidemics like plague cause initially expanding populations to halt or shrink, limiting the single greatest factor of production: human manual labor.  Volume fluctuations in trade due to political instability are frequent; historically, trading was subject to great risk and transport of goods and raw materials was expensive, difficult, slow and unreliable. The manufacturing sector and other industries have a tendency to grow but are limited by inadequate scientific knowledge and a "backward" or highly traditionalist frame of mind which contributes to low labour productivity. In this stage, some regions are entirely self-sufficient.

In settled agricultural societies before the Industrial Revolution, a hierarchical social structure relied on near-absolute reverence for tradition, and an insistence on obedience and submission.  This resulted in concentration of political power in the hands of landowners in most cases; everywhere, family and lineage, and marriage ties, constituted the primary social organization, along with religious customs, and the state only rarely interacted with local populations and in limited spheres of life.  This social structure was generally feudalistic in nature.  Under modern conditions, these characteristics have been modified by outside influences, but the least developed regions and societies fit this description quite accurately..

=== Pre-conditions for Take-off ===

In the second stage of economic growth the economy undergoes a process of change for building up of conditions for growth and take off. [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Rostow]] said that these changes in society and the economy had to be of fundamental nature in the socio-political structure and production techniques.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt; This pattern was followed in Europe, parts of Asia, the Middle East and Africa. There is also a second or third pattern in which he said that there was no need for change in socio-political structure because these economies were not deeply caught up in older, traditional social and political structures. The only changes required were in economic and technical dimensions.  The nations which followed this pattern were in North America and Oceania (New Zealand and Australia).

There are three important dimensions to this transition: firstly, the shift from an agrarian to an industrial or manufacturing society begins, albeit slowly. Secondly, trade and other commercial activities of the nation broaden the market's reach not only to neighboring areas but also to far-flung regions, creating international markets. Lastly, the surplus attained should not be wasted on the [[conspicuous consumption]] of the land owners or the state, but should be spent on the development of industries, infrastructure and thereby prepare for self-sustained growth of the economy later on. Furthermore, agriculture becomes commercialized and mechanized via technological advancement; shifts increasingly towards cash or export-oriented crops; and there is a growth of agricultural entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brett Wallace |url=http://www.slideshare.net/geographyalltheway/ib-geography-develpent-rostow-model |title=IB Geography: Development: Rostow Model |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2008-02-02 |accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategic factor is that investment level should be above 5% of the [[national income]]. This rise in investment rate depends on many sectors of the economy. According to [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Rostow]] capital formation depends on the productivity of agriculture and the  creation of social overhead capital.  Agriculture plays a very important role in this transition process as the surplus quantity of the produce is to be utilized to support an increasing urban population of workers and also becomes a major exporting sector, earning foreign exchange for continued development and capital formation. Increases in agricultural productivity also lead to expansion of the domestic markets for manufactured goods and processed commodities, which adds to the growth of investment in the industrial sector.

Social overhead capital creation can only be undertaken by government, in Rostow's view.  Government plays the driving role in development of social overhead capital as it is rarely profitable, it has a long gestation period, and the pay-offs accrue to all economic sectors, not primarily to the investing entity; thus the private sector is not interested in playing a major role in its development.

All these changes effectively prepare the way for "take-off" only if there is basic change in attitude of society towards risk taking, changes in working environment, and openness to change in social and political organisations and structures.
According to Rostow, the preconditions to take-off begins from an external intervention by more developed and advanced societies, which "set in motion ideas and sentiments which initiated the process by which a modern alternative to the traditional society was constructed out of the old culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seligso|first=Mitchell A.|title=The Five Stages of Growth W.W. Rostow|journal=Development and Underdevelopment: The Political Economy of Global Inequality|date=|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-conditions of take-off closely track the historic stages of the (initially) British Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="rd"/&gt; 

Referring to the '''graph''' of savings and investment, notably, there is a steep increase in the rate of savings and investment from the stage of "Pre Take-off" till "Drive to Maturity:" then, following that stage, the growing rate of savings and investment moderates.  This initial and accelerating steep increase in savings and investment is a pre-condition for the economy to reach the "Take-off" stage and far beyond.

=== Take-off ===

This stage is characterized by dynamic economic growth. As Rostow suggests, all is premised on a sharp stimulus (or multiple stimuli) that is/are any or all of economic, political and technological change. The main feature of this stage is rapid, self-sustained growth.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rd"/&gt; Take-off occurs when [[List of recognized economic sectors|sector]] led growth becomes common and society is driven more by economic processes than traditions. At this point, the norms of economic growth are well established and growth becomes a nation's "second nature" and a shared goal.&lt;ref name="mth"/&gt; In discussing the take-off, Rostow is noted to have adopted the term "transition", which describes the process of a traditional economy becoming a modern one. After take-off, a country will generally take as long as fifty to one hundred years to reach the mature stage according to the model, as occurred in countries that participated in the Industrial Revolution and were established as such when Rostow developed his ideas in the 1950s.

Per Rostow there are three main requirements for take-off:&lt;blockquote&gt;1. The rate of productive investment should rise from approximately 5% to over 10% of national income or net national product&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2. The development of one or more substantial manufacturing sectors, with a high rate of growth;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;3. The existence or quick emergence of a political, social and institutional framework which exploits the impulses to expansion in the modern sector and the potential external economy effects of the take-off.&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;The third requirement implies that the needed capital must be mobilized from domestic resources and steered into the economy, rather than into domestic or state consumption.Industrialization becomes a crucial phenomenon as it helps to prepare the basic structure for structural changes on a massive scale.  Rostow says that this transition does not follow a set trend as there are a variety of different motivations or stimulus which began this growth process.
Take off requires a large and sufficient amount of loanable funds for expansion of the industrial sector which generally come from two sources which are:
#Shifts in income flows by way of taxation, implementation of land reforms and various other fiscal measures.
#Re-investment of profits earned from foreign trade as has been observed in many East Asian countries.  While there are other examples of "Take-off" based on rapidly increasing demand for domestically produced goods for sale in domestic markets, more countries have followed the export-based model, overall and in the recent past.  The US, Canada, Russia and Sweden are examples of domestically based "take-off"; all of them, however, were characterized by massive capital imports and rapid adoption of their trading partners' technological advances.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nvcc.edu/home/nvfordc/econdev/introduction/stages.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040618120100/http://www.nvcc.edu/home/nvfordc/econdev/introduction/stages.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-06-18 |title=Stages of Development |publisher=Nvcc.edu |date=2004-04-22 |accessdate=2014-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This entire process of expansion of the industrial sector yields an increase in rate of return to some individuals who save at high rates and invest their savings in the industrial sector activities. The economy exploit their underutilized natural resources to increase their production.&lt;ref name="mth"/&gt;

[[File:table for take-off.jpg|thumb|300px|Tentative take-off dates&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;]]

The take-off also needs a group of entrepreneurs in the society who pursue innovation and accelerate the rate of growth in the economy.  For such an entrepreneurial class to develop, firstly, an ethos of "delayed gratification", a preference for capital accumulation over expenditure, and high tolerance of risk must be present. Secondly, entrepreneurial groups typically develop because they can not secure prestige and power in their society via marriage, via participating in well-established industries, or through government or military service (among other routes to prominence) because of some disqualifying social or legal attribute; and lastly, their rapidly changing society must tolerate unorthodox paths to economic and political power.

The ability of a country to make it through this stage depends on the following major factors:
*Existence of enlarged, sustained effective demand for the product of key sectors.
*Introduction of new productive technologies and techniques in these sectors.
*The society's increasing capacity to generate or earn enough capital to complete the take-off transition.
*Activities in the key sector should induce a chain of growth in other sectors of the economy, that also develop rapidly.

An example of a country in the Take-off stage of development is Equatorial Guinea. It has the largest increases in GDP growth since 1980 and the rate of productive investment has risen from 5% to over 10% of income or product.

In the table note that Take-off periods of different countries are the same as the industrial revolution in those countries.

=== Drive to Maturity ===

After take-off, there follows a long interval of sustained growth known as the stage of drive to maturity. Rostow defines it "as the period when a society has effectively applied the range of modern technology to the bulk of its resources."&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt; Now regularly growing economy drives to extend modern technology over the whole front of its economic activity. Some 10-20% of the national income is steadily invested, permitting output regularly to outstrip the increase in population. The makeup of the economy changes unceasingly as technique improves, new industries accelerate, older industries level off. The economy finds its place in the international economy: goods formerly imported are produced at home; new import requirements develop, and new export commodities to match them. The leading sectors in an economy will be determined by the nature of resource endowments and not only by technology.

[[File:table for drive to maturity.jpg|thumb|300px|Tentative drive to maturity dates&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;]]
On comparing the dates of take-off and drive to maturity, these countries reached the stage of maturity in approximately 60 years.

The structural changes in the society during this stage are in three ways:
* Work force composition in agriculture shifts from 75% of the working population to 20%. The workers acquire greater skill and their wages increase in real terms.
* The character of leadership changes significantly in the industries and a high degree of professionalism is introduced
* Environmental and health cost of industrialization is recognized and policy changes are thus made.
During this stage a country has to decide whether the industrial power and technology it has generated is to be used for the welfare of its people or to gain supremacy over others, or the world ''in toto''.

A prime example of a country in the Drive to Maturity stage is South Africa. It is developing a world-class infrastructure- including a modern transport network, widely available energy, and sophisticated telecommunications facilities. Additionally, the commercial farm sector shed 140,000 jobs, a decline of roughly 20%, in the eleven-year period from 1988 to 1998.

This diversity leads to reduction in poverty rate and increasing standards of living, as the society no longer needs to sacrifice its comfort in order to build up certain sectors.&lt;ref name="rl" /&gt;

=== Age of High Mass Consumption ===

The age of high mass consumption refers to the period of contemporary comfort afforded many western nations, wherein consumers concentrate on [[durable good]]s, and hardly remember the subsistence concerns of previous stages. Rostow uses the Buddenbrooks dynamics metaphor to describe this change in attitude. In [[Thomas Mann]]'s 1901 novel, ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', a family is chronicled for three generations. The first generation is interested in economic development, the second in its position in society. The third, already having money and prestige, concerns itself with the [[arts]] and [[music]], worrying little about those previous, earthly concerns. So too, in the age of high mass consumption, a society is able to choose between concentrating on [[military]] and [[security]] issues, on [[social equality|equality]] and [[Social welfare|welfare]] issues, or on developing great [[luxuries]] for its upper class. Each country in this position chooses its own balance between these three goals.  There is a desire to develop an egalitarian society and measures are taken to reach this goal.  According to Rostow, a country tries to determine its uniqueness and factors affecting it are its political, geographical and cultural structure and also values present in its society.&lt;ref name="rl" /&gt;

Historically, the United States is said to have reached this stage first, followed by other western European nations, and then Japan in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;

=== Dark Matter Consumption ===

This step is more of a theoretical speculation by Rostow rather than an analytical step in the process by Rostow.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beckett, Paul A. ''The Journal of Developing Areas'' 29.2 (1995): 284-86. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals begin having larger families and do not value income as a pre-requisite for more vacation days. Consumer products become more durable and more diverse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; New Americans will behave in a way where the high economic security and level mass consumption is considered normal. Rostow does make the point that it is possible with the large baby boom it could either cause economic issues or dictate an even larger diffusion of consumer goods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With increasing urban and suburban population there will be undoubtedly an increase in consumer goods and services as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Criticism of the model ==

# Rostow is '''historical''' in the sense that the end result is known at the outset and is derived from the historical geography of a developed, bureaucratic society.
# Rostow is '''mechanical''' in the sense that the underlying motor of change is not disclosed and therefore the stages become little more than a classificatory system based on data from developed countries.
# His model is based on American and European history and defines the American norm of high mass consumption as integral to the economic development process of all industrialized societies.
# His model assumes the inevitable adoption of [[Neoliberal]] trade policies which allow the manufacturing base of a given advanced polity to be relocated to lower-wage regions.
# Rostow's model does not apply to the Asian and the African countries as events in these countries are not justified in any stage of his model.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
# The stages are not identifiable properly as the conditions of the take-off and pre take-off stage are very similar and also overlap.
# According to Rostow growth becomes automatic by the time it reaches the maturity stage but Kuznets asserts that no growth can be automatic there is need for push always.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
# There appear to be two parallel theories of 'take-off' one is that 'take-off' is a sectoral and non-linear notion, and the other is that it is highly aggregative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Itagaki |first=Yoichi |title=Criticism of Rostow's Stage Approach: The Concept of State, System and Type |journal=The Developing Economies |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–17 |year=1963 |doi=10.1111/j.1746-1049.1963.tb01138.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rostow's thesis''' is biased towards a western model of modernization, but at the time of Rostow the world's only mature economies were in the west, and no controlled economies were in the "era of high mass consumption." The model de-emphasizes differences between sectors in capitalistic vs. communistic societies, but seems to innately recognize that modernization can be achieved in different ways in different types of economies.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Another assumption that Rostow took is of trying to fit economic progress into a linear system. This assumption is questioned due to empirical evidence of many countries making 'false starts' then reaching a degree of progress and change and then slipping back. E.g.: In the case of contemporary [[Russia]] slipping back from high mass consumption to a country in [[Transition economy|transition]].

Another criticism of Rostow's work is that it consideres large countries with a large population ([[Japan]]), with natural resources available at just the right time in its history ([[Coal]] in [[Northern Europe|Northern European countries]]), or with a large land mass ([[Argentina]]). He has little to say and indeed offers little hope for small countries, such as [[Rwanda]], which do not have such advantages. [[Neoliberalism|Neo-liberal economic theory]] to Rostow, and many others, does offer hope to much of the world that economic maturity is coming and the age of high mass consumption is nigh.This does leave a potential "grim meathook future" for the [[wikt:periphery|outliers]], which do not have the resources, political will, or external backing to become [[Competition (companies)|competitive]] with already developed economies.&lt;ref&gt;"Grim Meathook Future" is a quote from new media writer Joshua Ellis{{cite web|url=http://www.zenarchery.com/2005/09/22/full-text-of-the-grim-meathook-future-thing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329063043/http://www.zenarchery.com/2005/09/22/full-text-of-the-grim-meathook-future-thing/ |archivedate=2006-03-29 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Dependency theory]])

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}

The '''Saltire Prize''', named after the [[flag of Scotland]], is the national award for advances in the commercial development of [[marine energy]].

To be considered for the £10 million award teams must demonstrate, in [[Scottish waters]], a commercially viable [[Wave energy|wave]] or [[tidal stream energy]] technology "that achieves the greatest volume of electrical output over the set minimum hurdle of 100GWh over a continuous 2 year period using only the power of the sea."

The Saltire Prize is open to any individual, team or organisation from across the world who believes they have wave or tidal energy technology capable of fulfilling the challenge. Applications can be submitted between March 2010 and January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltireprize.com/challenge |title=The Challenge | publisher=saltireprize.com |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already there are five competitors registered.

==Additional prizes==

• The '''Saltire Prize Lecture''' - delivered at the Scottish Renewables Marine Conference every September, it focuses on the challenges in converting our world lead in wave and tidal energy to an industry of commercial scale, and in securing the economic, environmental and social benefits that this industry can bring.  The lecture is designed to promote knowledge exchange between academics, industry, financiers and government.

• The '''Saltire Prize Medal''' - created to recognise outstanding contributions to the development of marine renewable energy. The Medal is awarded every March at the Scottish Renewables Annual Conference, Exhibition and Dinner.

• The '''Junior Saltire Prize''' - launched in 2011, this is aimed at primary and secondary school pupils and was designed to help raise awareness of the opportunities that Scotland has to exploit its marine renewables potential.  It is sponsored by Skills Development Scotland and awards are presented to teams in three age groups: p5-7, s1-3 and s4-6.

• A '''Saltire Prize-sponsored doctorate''' in collaboration with the Energy Technology Partnership (ETP) - This was announced in August 2012.  The research will consider how marine energy projects can be designed to maximise economic energy production while protecting the environment.

• '''Power of the Sea''' - a one off junior photography competition sponsored by the Saltire Prize, aimed at raising awareness of the natural environment and its potential for marine energy.	In December 2012, four young photographers from Scottish primary schools were selected by renowned Scottish photographer, David Eustace, as the national winners.

==History==
When it was first announced in 2008 it was the world's largest ever single prize for innovation in marine renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/04/02151533 |title=World to compete for Saltire Prize| publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=4 April 2008 |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize is overseen by the Challenge Committee. Saltire Prize policy is the responsibility of the Offshore Renewables Policy Team in the Scottish Government's Energy and Climate Change Directorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltireprize.com/about-us |title=About us| publisher=saltireprize.com |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3970">The '''self-consistency principle''' was established by [[Rolf Hagedorn]] in 1965 to explain the thermodynamics of [[Fireball concept|fireballs]] in [[high energy physics]] collisions. A thermodynamical approach to the high energy collisions first proposed by [[Enrico Fermi|E. Fermi]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Fermi. Prog. Theor. Phys. 5 (1950) 570.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partition function==
The partition function of the [[Fireball concept|fireballs]] can be written in two forms, one in terms of its density of states, &lt;math&gt;\sigma(E)&lt;/math&gt;, and the other in terms of its mass spectrum, &lt;math&gt;\rho(m)&lt;/math&gt;.

The self-consistency principle says that both forms must be asymptotically equivalent for energies or masses sufficiently high (asymptotic limit). Also, the density of states and the mass spectrum must be asymptotically equivalent in the sense of the weak constraint proposed by Hagedorn&lt;ref&gt;R. Hagedorn, Suppl. Al Nuovo Cimento 3 (1965) 147.&lt;/ref&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt; log[\rho(m)]= log[\sigma(E)] &lt;/math&gt;.

These two conditions are known as the ''self-consistency principle'' or ''bootstrap-idea''. After a long mathematical analysis Hagedorn was able to prove that there is in fact &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \rho(m) &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sigma(E)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the above conditions, resulting in

:&lt;math&gt; \rho(m) = a m^{-5/2} exp(\beta_o m) &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma(E) = b E^{\alpha -1} exp(\beta_o E) &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\textstyle a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \alpha &lt;/math&gt; related by

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{a V}{(2 \pi \beta)^{3/5}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the asymptotic partition function is given by

:&lt;math&gt; Z_q(V_o,T)=\bigg(\frac{1}{\beta - \beta _o }\bigg)^{\alpha}-1 &lt;/math&gt;

where a singularity is clearly observed for &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; →&lt;math&gt;\beta_o&lt;/math&gt;. This singularity determines the limiting temperature &lt;math&gt;\textstyle T_o=1/\beta _o&lt;/math&gt; in Hagedorn's theory, which is also known as [[Hagedorn temperature]].

Hagedorn was able not only to give a simple explanation for the thermodynamical aspect of high energy particle production, but also worked out a formula for the [[hadronic]] mass spectrum and predicted the limiting temperature for hot hadronic systems.

After some time this limiting temperature was shown by [[Nicola Cabibbo|N. Cabibbo]] and [[Giorgio Parisi|G. Parisi]] to be related to a [[phase transition]],&lt;ref&gt;N. Cabibbo and G. Parisi, Phys. Lett. 59B (1975) 67.&lt;/ref&gt; which characterizes by the deconfinement of [[quark]]s at high energies. The mass spectrum was further analyzed by [[Steven Frautschi]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Frautschi, Phys. Rev. D 11 (1971) 2821.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Q-exponential function==
The Hagedorn theory was able to describe correctly the experimental data from collision with center-of-mass energies up to approximately 10 GeV, but above this region it failed. In 2000 [[I. Bediaga]], [[E. M. F. Curado]] and [[J. M. de Miranda]]&lt;ref&gt;I. Bediaga, E.M.F. Curado and J.M. de Miranda, Physica A 286 (2000) 156.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a phenomenological generalization of Hagedorn's theory by replacing the exponential function that appears in the partition function by the [[Tsallis_statistics#q-exponential|q-exponential]] function from the [[Constantino Tsallis|Tsallis]] non-extensive statistics. With this modification the generalized theory was able again to describe the extended experimental data.

In 2012 [[A. Deppman]] proposed a [[non-extensive self-consistent thermodynamical theory]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Deppman, Physica A 391 (2012) 6380.&lt;/ref&gt; that includes the self-consistency principle and the non-extensive statistics. This theory gives as result the same formula proposed by [[Bediaga]] et al., which describes correctly the high energy data, but also new formulas for the mass spectrum and density of states of fireball. It also predicts a new limiting temperature and a limiting entropic index.

'''''Rochdale'' and ''Prince of Wales''''' were two troop ships that sank in Dublin Bay in 1807.

[[Dublin Port]] had long been dangerous because it was accessible only at high tide and was subject to sudden storms.  Many ships were lost while waiting for the tide, but little was done until this disaster.  The impact of 400 bodies&lt;ref&gt;Reports of the numbers lost are contradictory.  They vary from 380 to 500.   Most published reports say 400&lt;/ref&gt; being washed up on an urban shore had an effect on public and official opinion. This event was the impetus to the building of [[Dún Laoghaire]] Harbour.&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, H. A., 1980, ''Captain William Hutchison and the early Dublin Bay lifeboats''. Dublin Historical Record, 2: 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 November 1807 several ships left [[Dublin Port|Dublin]] carrying troops bound for the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic war]].  The next day, two ships, the [[brig]] ''Rochdale'' and H.M. [[Packet ship]] ''Prince of Wales'', having been caught in gale-force winds and heavy snow, were lost.&lt;ref name=dlwalktour&gt;{{cite web | title = Historical Coastal Walking Tour | publisher = [[Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council]] | date =  | url = http://www.iopener.ie/downloads/iOpener-Dun-Laoghaire-Script.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 28 March 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120211081202/http://www.iopener.ie/downloads/iOpener-Dun-Laoghaire-Script.pdf | archivedate = 11 February 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Troops on ''Prince of Wales'' may have been deliberately locked below deck while the ship's captain and crew escaped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=4005 AAI | Physical Landscape&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123035401/http://askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=4005 |date=23 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] was launched.  There was looting.

==Maritime background==
This tragedy was the impetus to the building of Dún Laoghaire Harbour, which was initially called "Dunleary", then "Kingstown", and now "Dún Laoghaire".  [[Dublin port]] was hampered by a [[Shoal|sandbar]], which meant that ships could enter or leave only at high tide.  A solution, the building of the North Bull Wall, had been identified by Vice-Admiral [[William Bligh]] in 1800.  If there was a storm, a ship would have to ride out the storm in the open sea, waiting for the tide.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The bay of Dublin has perhaps been more fatal to seamen and ships than any in the world, for a ship once caught in it in a gale of wind from ENE to SSE must ride it out at anchors or go on shore, and from the nature of that shore the whole of the crews almost invariably have perished." – Captain [[Charles Malcolm]] of George IV's royal yacht.&lt;ref&gt;de Courcy Ireland, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A pier had been built at Dún Laoghaire, now known as the "coal harbour", in 1767, but it had rapidly silted up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlrcoco.ie/library/dlhist.htm Dún Laoghaire Library – A history of Dún Laoghaire]&lt;/ref&gt; The early nineteenth century was unusually stormy.&lt;ref&gt;John Sweeney,''A three-century storm climatology for Dublin 1715–2000'', Irish Geography, Volume 33(1), 2000, 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Dublin Bay was notoriously treacherous for boats. The remains of at least 600 vessels rest at the bottom of the bay.&lt;ref name=dlwalktour/&gt;

On 19 November 1807, the sea began to swell. [[Wind speed]] increased to hurricane force.  Sleet and snow fell to such intensity that visibility was reduced to zero; they may not have realised how close they were to shore.  The east wind blew the ships back towards the shore.

While ''Rochdale'' and ''Prince of Wales'' were lost, another troop transport, ''Lark'', which left earlier, safely reached [[Holyhead]].  Other ships were lost at that time.  A [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] was lost at the South Bull (outside Dublin Port).   The inbound [[Liverpool]] packet was lost off Bray.

== Military background ==
In July 1807, following military successes, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] signed the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] with [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Brandenburg-Prussia|Prussia]] leaving him master of central and eastern Europe. He then turned his attention westward to [[Mid-nineteenth century Spain|Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. The British government was alarmed. Soldiers were recruited to defend England's coast and to intervene in Spain (see [[Peninsular War]]) under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]].

Fear of an invasion of Ireland was further met by the building of [[Martello Tower]]s on the southern and eastern coasts and [[watchtower]]s on the other coastlines.

French troops had invaded Ireland on 22 August 1798, under [[Jean Joseph Amable Humbert|General Humbert]], establishing the short-lived [[Republic of Connacht]]. On that occasion the [[County Mayo|Mayo]] [[Militia (United Kingdom)#Irish militia|Militia]] was ingloriously defeated in what became known as the [[Battle of Castlebar#The "Races of Castlebar "|Races of Castlebar]]. In 1807 many members of the North Mayo and South Mayo Militias volunteered and were lost from the ''Prince of Wales''. They joined the [[97th Regiment of Foot]], the [[96th Regiment of Foot#Minorca Regiment|Minorca Regiment]], which was known as the "Queens Own Germans" as it was initially formed from Swiss and German mercenaries. (In 1816, the 97th was renumbered as the 96th).

The North Cork Militia was active in suppressing the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. They suffered a defeat at the [[Battle of Oulart Hill]]. In 1807, while most joined the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684-1922)|18th Regiment of Foot]] so many members of the North Cork Militia volunteered that they had to be dispersed over 25 different regiments.

They joined the British Army for a shilling a week and three meals a day – an alternative to terrible poverty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/radio1/seascapes/1118749.html Seascapes News Summary – 11 December 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011154759/http://www.rte.ie/radio1/seascapes/1118749.html |date=11 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HM Packet ship ''Prince of Wales''==
HM Packet ship ''Prince of Wales'' was a [[Sloop#Historic naval definition|sloop]] of 103 tons with a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of 11 feet.  She was built in [[Parkgate, Cheshire]] in 1787.

She sailed under Captain Robert Jones of Liverpool carrying the 97th regiment on 19 November.  The next day she had progressed only to a point opposite [[Bray Head]], a matter of a few miles.  She cast anchor, but the sea was so violent that she failed to come to anchor; she was blown back past Dún Laoghaire.  Her sails were completely torn.  She was driven onto rocks at [[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]].
There was just one [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|longboat]] aboard.  Captain Jones, nine seamen, two women with children (family members), and two soldiers escaped on this lifeboat.  They did not know where they were, or how close they were to the shore.  They rowed parallel to the shore until one of the sailors fell overboard and found that he was standing in shallow water.
It was alleged that the troops were locked below deck, the ladder withdrawn, and the hatch battened down.  All 120 soldiers drowned in the storm and are interred in [[Merrion Cemetery, Bellevue|Merrion Cemetery]] not too far from where the incident occurred.

== ''Rochdale'' ==
''Rochdale'' was larger than ''Prince of Wales''. She was built in 1797; she was a brig of 135 tons and a ten-foot draught. She sailed under Captain Hodgson. She was driven along a similar path as the Prince of Wales. She cast anchors but the cable snapped. On shore cries of the terrified passengers could be heard. As she swept past Dún Laoghaire, soldiers on board fired their muskets to attract attention.  At Salthill, would-be rescuers had to shelter from the gunfire.  Off Blackrock, blue lights were seen and gunfire heard. She stuck the rocks at the Seapoint Martello tower. A twelve-foot plank would have rescued them, but all 265, including 42 women and 29 children, on board were lost. Their bodies were unrecognisable, being mutilated by the sea and the rocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=3577 Man and the landscape in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121152221/http://askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=3577 |date=21 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those who perished are interred in [[Carrickbrennan Churchyard]] in [[Monkstown, County Dublin|Monkstown]] with a memorial.

==Lifeboats==
Although there were lifeboats stationed at [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]], Bullock, [[Howth]], Dún Laoghaire and [[Islandbridge]] none were launched.

==Looting==
There was looting of the ships and the items washed ashore.  An immense amount of baggage was washed ashore and troops were put on guard. Looters gathered as was usual at the time and one from Dún Laoghaire was drowned. All the weekend was spent in collecting the bodies for burial.  The Regimental Silver Plate of the Queens Own Germans was lost.  Rewards were offered.  Six persons were convicted and sent to [[Kilmainham Gaol]] for plundering bodies or articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlrcoco.ie/gp/CommemorationCememony_221107.htm Hooper, Darrell, ''A Story of Lives Lost''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612141754/http://www.dlrcoco.ie/gp/CommemorationCememony_221107.htm |date=12 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder Charge==
Captain Robert Jones and his crew survived in the only lifeboat.  Two soldiers also survived.  The captain was accused of murder.&lt;ref&gt;[[Freeman's Journal]] 30 November: “Yesterday, Robert Jones, Master of the Prince of Wales, the Mate and the ship’s Steward, were fully committed to Newgate to abide their trial on a charge of murder for having removed the ladders that communicated between the deck and the hold of the vessel, whereby the passengers were prevented from making any exertion to escape the dreadful fate which they suffered.”&lt;/ref&gt;  The Captain said that the lifeboat was not launched; rather, it was cast into the sea by the storm, so he ordered those on deck to get into it.  Anthony McIntyre of the 18th Royal Irish said that the captain launched the lifeboat and that the ladder from the hold to the deck was withdrawn.  Andrew Boyle, also of the 18th Royal Irish, spoke through an Irish interpreter, saying that the ladder was not removed because “persons below held on to it very tightly”.  The verdict was "Casual death by shipwreck". The case was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Williamson, Robert Kennedy &amp; Cian Kennedy ''Lost at Sea'' CBC Monkstown Library {{cite web|url=http://www.cbcmonkstown.ie/library/carrickbrennan/lost_at_sea.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119002603/http://cbcmonkstown.ie/library/carrickbrennan/lost_at_sea.htm |archivedate=19 November 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dún Laoghaire Harbour ==
The [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] having been abolished, from 1 January 1801 Irish members of parliament had to travel to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].  That meant frequent travel across the [[Irish Sea]].
A campaign to build a harbour at Dún Laoghaire was already under way.  The person chiefly responsible was a resident [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[Licensed mariner|master mariner]] and [[Shipbroking|shipbroker]] named Richard Toucher, who worked tirelessly campaigning to bring about the construction of a safe port. His Asylum Harbour was conceived as a refuge for sailing ships in trouble in Dublin Bay.
After this tragedy, the campaign received the support required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=156&amp;version=text_only Transport at Dún Laoghaire Port] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124073218/http://askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=156&amp;version=text_only |date=24 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'asylum' in this context means a harbour where ships can seek refuge from a storm.

Construction commenced on a packet harbour at Howth, which was completed in 1809.  Travelling from Dublin to Howth meant travelling through the 'badlands of [[Sutton, Dublin|Sutton]]', where coaches were liable to be raided.&lt;ref&gt;Fewer, Michael, ''By Swerve of Shore'', (Gill, Dublin, 2002), {{ISBN|0-7171-3353-2}}, an account of the author's walk along the coast of [[County Dublin]]&lt;/ref&gt; Howth was a shallow harbour, and as larger ships were built, in particular with the introduction of steam packets from 1819, it became unsuitable, its rocky bottom precluded any dredging.

In 1815, eight Harbour Commissioners were appointed to supervise the building of a new harbour at Dún Laoghaire.  [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] visited in 1821, arriving at Howth and departing from Dún Laoghaire.  He renamed the town "Kingstown".&lt;ref&gt;Booterstown and Carysfort, A Parochial History 1821 to 1984, by Robert Knaggs {{cite web|url=http://booterstown.dublin.anglican.org/rkbook.asp?page%3D2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616010422/http://booterstown.dublin.anglican.org/rkbook.asp?page=2 |archivedate=16 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name reverted to Dún Laoghaire in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=156 AAI | Transport&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123030546/http://askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=156 |date=23 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spin-stabilisation''' is the method of stabilizing a [[satellite]] or [[launch vehicle]] by means of spin. For most satellite applications this approach has been superseded by [[three-axis stabilisation]].  It is also used in non-satellite applications such as [[rifle]] and [[artillery]].

Despinning can be achieved by various techniques, including [[yo-yo de-spin]].

==Use==
On rockets with a solid motor upper stage, spin stabilization is used to keep the motor from drifting off course as they don't have their own thrusters. Usually small rockets are used to spin up the spacecraft and rocket then fire the rocket and send the craft off.

Rockets that use spin stabilization
* Jupiter C upper stages
* Delta II on some flights
* [[Minotaur V]]

The [[Pioneer 4]] spacecraft, the second object sent on a lunar flyby in [[1959 in spaceflight|1959]], maintained its attitude using spin-stabilization.&lt;ref name="The Moon Probe"&gt;

The [[Schiaparelli EDM lander]] was spun up to 2.5 RPM before being ejected from the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]] prior to its attempted landing on Mars in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://spaceflight101.com/exomars/schiaparelli-edm/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another spin-stabilized spacecraft is [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]], which arrived at Jupiter orbit in 2016.

In operation as a third stage, the [[Star 48]] rocket booster sits on top of spin table, and before it is separated it is spun up to stabilize it during the separation from the previous stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjAJNZYQ9K8C&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Star+48B&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrsuykrZreAhUS2FMKHWvlD98Q6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Star%2048B&amp;f=false|title=Space Handbook: A War Fighter's Guide to Space, V. 1|last=Muolo|first=Michael J.|date=November 1993|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=9780160613555|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1676">'''Syllabograms''' are [[grapheme|sign]]s used to write the [[syllable]]s (or [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]e) of words.  This term is most often used in the context of a [[writing system]] otherwise organized on different principles—an [[alphabet]] where most symbols represent [[phoneme]]s, or a [[logogram|logographic]] script where most symbols represent [[morpheme]]s—but a system based mostly on syllabograms is a [[syllabary]].

Syllabograms in the [[Maya script]] most frequently take the form of V (vowel) or CV (consonant-vowel) syllables of which approximately 83 are known. CVC signs are present as well. Two modern well-known examples of [[syllabary|syllabaries]] consisting mostly of CV syllabograms are the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[kana]], used to represent the same sounds in different occasions.  Syllabograms tend not to be used for languages with more complicated syllables: for example [[Phonotactics#English_phonotactics|English phonotactics]] allows syllables as complex as CCCVCCCC (as in {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|r|ɛ|ŋ|k|θ|s}} ''strengths''), generating many thousands of possible syllables and making the use of syllabograms cumbersome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How many syllables does English have?|url = http://semarch.linguistics.fas.nyu.edu/barker/Syllables/index.txt|website = New York University|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160822211027/http://semarch.linguistics.fas.nyu.edu/barker/Syllables/index.txt|archive-date = 2016-08-22|author=Chris Barker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14068">[[Image:Trilinear coordinates.svg|right|300px]]

In [[geometry]], the '''trilinear coordinates''' ''x:y:z'' of a point relative to a given [[triangle]] describe the relative [[directed distance]]s from the three [[extended side|sidelines]] of the triangle.  Trilinear coordinates are an example of [[homogeneous coordinates]].  The ratio ''x:y'' is the ratio of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides ([[extended side|extended]] if necessary) opposite [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] ''A'' and ''B'' respectively; the ratio ''y:z'' is the ratio of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sidelines opposite vertices ''B'' and ''C'' respectively; and likewise for ''z:x'' and vertices ''C'' and ''A''.

In the diagram at right, the trilinear coordinates of the indicated interior point are the actual distances (''a' '', ''b' '', ''c' ''), or equivalently in ratio form, ''ka' '':''kb' '':''kc' '' for any positive constant ''k''. If a point is on a sideline of the reference triangle, its corresponding trilinear coordinate is 0. If an exterior point is on the opposite side of a sideline from the interior of the triangle, its trilinear coordinate associated with that sideline is negative. It is impossible for all three trilinear coordinates to be non-positive.

The name "trilinear coordinates" is sometimes abbreviated to "trilinears". 

==Notation==

The ratio notation ''x'':''y'':''z'' for trilinear coordinates is different from the ordered triple notation (''a' '', ''b' '', ''c' '') for actual directed distances. Here each of ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' has no meaning by itself; its ratio to one of the others ''does'' have meaning. Thus "comma notation" for trilinear coordinates should be avoided, because the notation (''x'', ''y'', ''z''), which means an ordered triple, does not allow, for example, (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = (2''x'', 2''y'', 2''z''), whereas the "colon notation" does allow ''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'' = 2''x'' : 2''y'' : 2''z''.

==Examples==

The trilinear coordinates of the [[incenter]] of a triangle ''ABC'' are 1 : 1 : 1; that is, the (directed) distances from the incenter to the sidelines ''BC'', ''CA'', ''AB'' are proportional to the actual distances denoted by (''r'', ''r'', ''r''), where ''r'' is the inradius of triangle ''ABC''. Given side lengths ''a, b, c'' we have:

:* ''A'' = 1 : 0 : 0
:* ''B'' = 0 : 1 : 0
:* ''C'' = 0 : 0 : 1
:* [[incenter]] = 1 : 1 : 1
:* [[centroid]] = ''bc'' : ''ca'' : ''ab'' = 1/''a'' : 1/''b'' : 1/''c'' = csc ''A'' : csc ''B'' : csc ''C''.
:* [[circumcenter]] = cos ''A'' : cos ''B'' : cos ''C''.
:* [[orthocenter]] = sec ''A'' : sec ''B'' : sec ''C''.
:* [[nine-point center]] = cos(''B'' &amp;minus; ''C'') : cos(''C'' &amp;minus; ''A'') : cos(''A'' &amp;minus; ''B'').
:* [[symmedian point]] = ''a'' : ''b'' : ''c'' = sin ''A'' : sin ''B'' : sin ''C''.
:* ''A''-excenter = &amp;minus;1 : 1 : 1
:* ''B''-excenter = 1 : &amp;minus;1 : 1
:* ''C''-excenter = 1 : 1 : &amp;minus;1.

Note that, in general, the incenter is not the same as the [[centroid]]; the centroid has [[Barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] 1 : 1 : 1 (these being proportional to actual signed areas of the triangles ''BGC'', ''CGA'', ''AGB'', where ''G'' = centroid.)

The midpoint of, for example, side ''BC'' has trilinear coordinates in actual sideline distances  &lt;math&gt;(0 , \frac{\Delta}{b} , \frac{\Delta}{c}) &lt;/math&gt; for triangle area &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;, which in arbitrarily specified relative distances simplifies to &lt;math&gt;0:ca:ab.&lt;/math&gt; The coordinates in actual sideline distances of the foot of the altitude from ''A'' to ''BC'' are &lt;math&gt;(0, \frac{2\Delta}{a}\cos C, \frac{2\Delta}{a}\cos B),&lt;/math&gt; which in purely relative distances simplifies to &lt;math&gt;0:\cos C:\cos B.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 96}}

==Formulas==

===Collinearities and concurrencies===

Trilinear coordinates enable many algebraic methods in triangle geometry.  For example, three points

:''P = p'' : ''q'' : ''r''
:''U = u'' : ''v'' : ''w''
:''X = x'' : ''y'' : ''z''

are [[collinearity|collinear]] if and only if the [[determinant]]

:&lt;math&gt; D = \begin{vmatrix}p&amp;q&amp;r\\
u&amp;v&amp;w\\x&amp;y&amp;z\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

equals zero.  Thus if ''x:y:z'' is a variable point, the equation of a line through the points ''P'' and ''U'' is ''D'' = 0.&lt;ref name=WW&gt;William Allen Whitworth (1866) [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;idno=01190002 Trilinear Coordinates and Other Methods of Analytical Geometry of Two Dimensions: an elementary treatise], link from [[Cornell University]] Historical Math Monographs.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 23}} From this, every straight line has a linear equation homogeneous in ''x, y, z''.  Every equation of the form ''lx+my+nz'' = 0 in real coefficients is a real straight line of finite points unless ''l : m: n'' is proportional to ''a : b : c'', the side lengths, in which case we have the locus of points at infinity.&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 40}}

The dual of this proposition is that the lines

:''pα + qβ + rγ = 0''
:''uα + vβ + wγ = 0'',
:''xα + yβ + zγ = 0''

[[concurrent lines|concur]] in a point (α, β, γ) if and only if ''D'' = 0.&lt;ref name="WW"/&gt;{{rp|p. 28}}

Also, if the actual directed distances are used when evaluating the determinant of ''D'', then the area of triangle ''PUX'' is ''KD'', where ''K'' = ''abc/8∆''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt; (and where ''∆'' is the area of triangle ''ABC'', as above) if triangle ''PUX'' has the same orientation (clockwise or counterclockwise) as triangle ''ABC'', and ''K'' = ''–abc/8∆''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt; otherwise.

===Parallel lines===

Two lines with trilinear equations &lt;math&gt;lx+my+nz=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l'x+m'y+n'z=0&lt;/math&gt; are parallel if and only if&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 98,#xi}}

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{vmatrix}l&amp;m&amp;n\\
l'&amp;m'&amp;n'\\a&amp;b&amp;c\end{vmatrix}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a, b, c'' are the side lengths.

===Angle between two lines===

The [[tangent (trigonometry)|tangents]] of the angles between two lines with trilinear equations &lt;math&gt;lx+my+nz=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l'x+m'y+n'z=0&lt;/math&gt; are given by&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p.50}}

:&lt;math&gt;\pm \frac{(mn'-m'n)\sin A + (nl'-n'l)\sin B + (lm'-l'm)\sin C}{ll' + mm' + nn' - (mn'+m'n)\cos A -(nl'+n'l)\cos B - (lm'+l'm)\cos C}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Perpendicular lines====

Thus two lines with trilinear equations &lt;math&gt;lx+my+nz=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l'x+m'y+n'z=0&lt;/math&gt; are perpendicular if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;ll'+mm'+nn'-(mn'+m'n)\cos A-(nl'+n'l)\cos B-(lm'+l'm)\cos C=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Altitude===

The equation of the [[altitude (geometry)|altitude]] from vertex ''A'' to side ''BC'' is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p.98,#x}}

:&lt;math&gt;y\cos B-z\cos C=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Line in terms of distances from vertices===

The equation of a line with variable distances ''p, q, r'' from the vertices ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' whose opposite sides are ''a, b, c'' is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 97,#viii}}

:&lt;math&gt;apx+bqy+crz=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Actual-distance trilinear coordinates===

The trilinears with the coordinate values ''a', b', c' ''  being the actual perpendicular distances to the sides satisfy&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 11}}

:&lt;math&gt;aa' +bb' + cc' =2\Delta&lt;/math&gt;

for triangle sides ''a, b, c'' and area &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. This can be seen in the figure at the top of this article, with interior point ''P'' partitioning triangle ''ABC'' into three triangles ''PBC'', ''PCA'', and ''PAB'' with respective areas (1/2)''aa' '', (1/2)''bb' '', and (1/2)''cc' ''.

===Distance between two points===

The distance ''d'' between two points with actual-distance trilinears ''a' ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''b' ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''c' ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 46}}

:&lt;math&gt;d^2\sin ^2 C=(a'_1-a'_2)^2+(b'_1-b'_2)^2+2(a'_1-a'_2)(b'_1-b'_2)\cos C.&lt;/math&gt;

===Distance from a point to a line===

The distance ''d'' from a point ''a' ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : ''b' ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : ''c' ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, in trilinear coordinates of actual distances, to a straight line ''lx + my + nz'' = 0 is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 48}}

:&lt;math&gt;d=\frac{la'_0+mb'_0+nc'_0}{\sqrt{l^2+m^2+n^2-2mn\cos A -2nl\cos B -2lm\cos C}}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Quadratic curves===

The equation of a [[conic section]] in the variable trilinear point ''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'' is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p.118}}

:&lt;math&gt;rx^2+sy^2+tz^2+2uyz+2vzx+2wxy=0.&lt;/math&gt;

It has no linear terms and no constant term.

The equation of a circle of radius ''r'' having center at actual-distance coordinates (''a', b', c' '') is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p.287}}

:&lt;math&gt;(x-a')^2\sin 2A+(y-b')^2\sin 2B+(z-c')^2\sin 2C=2r^2\sin A\sin B\sin C.&lt;/math&gt;

====Circumconics====

The equation in trilinear coordinates ''x, y, z'' of any [[circumconic]] of a triangle is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 192}}

:&lt;math&gt;lyz+mzx+nxy=0.&lt;/math&gt;

If the parameters ''l, m, n'' respectively equal the side lengths ''a, b, c'' (or the sines of the angles opposite them) then the equation gives the [[circumcircle]].&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 199}}

Each distinct circumconic has a center unique to itself. The equation in trilinear coordinates of the circumconic with center ''x' :  y' : z' '' is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 203}}

:&lt;math&gt;yz(x'-y'-z')+zx(y'-z'-x')+xy(z'-x'-y')=0.&lt;/math&gt;

====Inconics====

Every conic section [[inscribed figure|inscribed]] in a triangle has an equation in trilinear coordinates&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 208}}

:&lt;math&gt;l^2x^2+m^2y^2+n^2z^2 \pm 2mnyz \pm 2nlzx\pm 2lmxy =0,&lt;/math&gt;

with exactly one or three of the unspecified signs being negative.

The equation of the [[incircle]] can be simplified to&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 210, p.214}}

:&lt;math&gt;\pm \sqrt{x}\cos \frac{A}{2}\pm \sqrt{y}\cos \frac{B}{2}\pm\sqrt{z}\cos \frac{C}{2}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

while the equation for, for example, the [[excircle]] adjacent to the side segment opposite vertex ''A'' can be written as&lt;ref name= WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 215}}

:&lt;math&gt;\pm \sqrt{-x}\cos \frac{A}{2}\pm \sqrt{y}\cos \frac{B}{2}\pm\sqrt{z}\cos \frac{C}{2}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Cubic curves===
Many cubic curves are easily represented using trilinear coordinates.  For example, the pivotal self-isoconjugate cubic ''Z(U,P)'', as the locus of a point ''X'' such that the ''P''-isoconjugate of ''X'' is on the line ''UX'' is given by the determinant equation

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{vmatrix}x&amp;y&amp;z\\
qryz&amp;rpzx&amp;pqxy\\u&amp;v&amp;w\end{vmatrix} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Among named cubics ''Z(U,P)'' are the following:

: Thomson cubic: ''Z(X(2),X(1))'', where ''X(2) = ''[[centroid]], ''X(1) = ''[[incenter]]
: Feuerbach cubic: ''Z(X(5),X(1))'', where ''X(5) = ''[[Feuerbach point]]
: Darboux cubic: ''Z(X(20),X(1))'', where ''X(20) = ''[[De Longchamps point]]
: Neuberg cubic: ''Z(X(30),X(1))'', where ''X(30) = ''[[Euler infinity point]].

==Conversions==

===Between trilinear coordinates and distances from sidelines===

For any choice of trilinear coordinates ''x:y:z'' to locate a point, the actual distances of the point from the sidelines are given by ''a' = kx'', ''b' = ky'', ''c' = kz'' where ''k'' can be determined by the formula &lt;math&gt;k = \frac{2\Delta}{ax + by + cz}&lt;/math&gt; in which ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are the respective sidelengths ''BC'', ''CA'', ''AB'', and ∆ is the area of ''ABC''.

===Between barycentric and trilinear coordinates===
A point with trilinear coordinates ''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'' has [[barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] ''ax'' : ''by'' : ''cz'' where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are the sidelengths of the triangle.  Conversely, a point with barycentrics ''α'' : ''β'' : ''γ'' has trilinear coordinates ''α/a'' : ''β/b'' : ''γ/c''.

===Between Cartesian and trilinear coordinates===
Given a reference triangle ''ABC'', express the position of the vertex ''B'' in terms of an ordered pair of [[Cartesian coordinates]] and represent this algebraically as a [[vector (geometric)|vector]] &lt;u&gt;''B''&lt;/u&gt;, using vertex ''C'' as the origin. Similarly define the position vector of vertex ''A'' as &lt;u&gt;''A''&lt;/u&gt;. Then any point ''P'' associated with the reference triangle ''ABC'' can be defined in a Cartesian system as a vector &lt;u&gt;''P''&lt;/u&gt; = ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;u&gt;''A''&lt;/u&gt; + ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;u&gt;''B''&lt;/u&gt;. If this point ''P'' has trilinear coordinates ''x : y : z'' then the conversion formula from the coefficients ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the Cartesian representation to the trilinear coordinates is, for side lengths ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' opposite vertices ''A'', ''B'', ''C'',

: &lt;math&gt;x:y:z = \frac{k_1}{a} : \frac{k_2}{b} : \frac{1 - k_1 - k_2}{c}, &lt;/math&gt;

and the conversion formula from the trilinear coordinates to the coefficients in the Cartesian representation is

: &lt;math&gt;k_1 = \frac{ax}{ax + by + cz}, \quad k_2 = \frac{by}{ax + by + cz}.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if an arbitrary origin is chosen where the Cartesian coordinates of the vertices are known and represented by the vectors &lt;u&gt;''A''&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;''B''&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;''C''&lt;/u&gt; and if the point ''P'' has trilinear coordinates ''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'', then the Cartesian coordinates of &lt;u&gt;''P''&lt;/u&gt; are the weighted average of the Cartesian coordinates of these vertices using the barycentric coordinates ''ax'', ''by'' and ''cz'' as the weights. Hence the conversion formula from the trilinear coordinates ''x, y, z''  to the vector of Cartesian coordinates &lt;u&gt;''P''&lt;/u&gt; of the point is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{P}=\frac{ax}{ax+by+cz}\underline{A}+\frac{by}{ax+by+cz}\underline{B}+\frac{cz}{ax+by+cz}\underline{C},&lt;/math&gt;
where the side lengths are |&lt;u&gt;''C''&lt;/u&gt; − &lt;u&gt;''B''&lt;/u&gt;| = ''a'', |&lt;u&gt;''A''&lt;/u&gt; − &lt;u&gt;''C''&lt;/u&gt;| = ''b'' and |&lt;u&gt;''B''&lt;/u&gt; − &lt;u&gt;''A''&lt;/u&gt;| = ''c''.

'''''Unfolding Object''''' is a 2002 work of [[internet art]] created by [[John Simon (artist)|John Simon]] after a commission from the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City]].  Along with ''[[net.flag]]'' by [[Mark Napier (artist)|Mark Napier]], it was among the first pieces of internet art to be collected by a major museum.

Simon has described ''Unfolding Object'' as "an endless book that rewrites itself and whose use dictates its content."  It begins as a blank square visible on a web page hosted on the museum's [[website]], but responds when clicked by visitors to the site.  Gradually the square unfolds, click by click, until it reaches a certain point, after which it begins to close.  The "pages" of the design are programmed to respond differently as they receive more clicks; vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines denote different numbers of previous clicks.  The colors of the square and of its background are both programmed to change hourly.

'''Universal mind''' or '''universal consciousness''' is a concept that tries to address the underlying essence of all being and becoming in the universe. It includes the being and becoming that occurred in the universe prior to the arising of the concept of "Mind", a term that more appropriately refers to the organic, human, aspect of universal consciousness. It addresses inorganic being and becoming and the interactions that occur in that process without specific reference to the physical and chemical laws that try to describe those interactions. Those interactions have occurred, do occur, and continue to occur. Universal consciousness is the source, ground, basis, that underlies those interactions and the awareness and knowledge they imply.

==Introduction==

The concept of universal mind was presented by [[Anaxagoras]], a [[Pre-Socratic philosopher]] who arrived in Athens some time after 480 BC. He taught that the growth of living things depends on the power of mind within the organisms that enables them to extract nourishment from surrounding substances. For this concept of mind, Anaxagoras was commended by [[Aristotle]]. Both [[Plato]] and Aristotle, however, objected that his notion of mind did not include a view that mind acts ethically, i.e. acts for the “best interests” of the universe.[1]

The most original aspect of Anaxagoras's system was his doctrine of ''[[nous]]'' ("mind" or "reason"). [2] A different Greek word, ''gnó̱si̱'' (awareness), better reflects what is observed in the wider world of organic and inorganic being than just the human world. A worm, an amoeba, a bacteria, a raindrop, appears to act with "awareness" (''gnó̱si̱'') rather than "reason" (''nous''). Also, these actions would not commonly be referred to as being "reasonable" or "ethical".

In "The Huang Po Doctrine of Universal Mind", originated in around 857 CE, the idea of mind was disconnected from soul in this Buddhist school of thought.

[[Chu Ch’an]] says, “Universal mind, therefore, is something to which nothing can be attributed. Being absolute, it is beyond attributes. If for example, it were to be described as infinite, that would exclude from it whatever is finite, but the whole argument of the book is that universal mind is the only reality and that everything we apprehend through our senses, is nothing else but this mind. Even to think of it in terms of existence or non-existence is to misapprehend it entirely.” pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9 [3]

The term surfaced again in later philosophy, as in the writings of Hegel. - Hegel writes:
{{quote|¤ 377  The knowledge of Mind is the highest and hardest, just because it is the most 'concrete' of sciences. The significance of that 'absolute' commandment, Know thyself − whether we look at it in itself or under the historical circumstances of its first utterance − is not  to promote mere self−knowledge in respect of the particular capacities, character, propensities, and foibles of the single self. The knowledge it commands means that of man's genuine reality − of what is  essentially and ultimately true and real − of mind as the true and  essential being.” [4]}}

==Definitions==
[[Ernest Holmes]], the founder of the [[Science of Mind]] movement, described the universal mind as follows: 
{{quote|The Universal Mind contains all knowledge. It is the potential ultimate of all things. To It all things are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=Ernest|title=The Science of Mind|date=1953|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[New Thought]] author [[Charles F. Haanel|Charles Haanel]] said of the universal mind and its relationship to humans:
{{quote|The Universal Mind, being infinite and omnipotent, has unlimited resources at its command, and when we remember that it is also omnipresent, we cannot escape the conclusion that we must be an expression or manifestation of that Mind. A recognition and understanding of the resources of the subconscious mind will indicate that the only difference between the subconscious and the Universal is one of degree. They differ only as a drop of water differs from the ocean. They are the same in kind and quality, the difference is one of degree only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haanel|first1=Charles|title=The Master Key System, chapter 14, section 20.|date=1912|isbn=978-1-61720-383-1|page=101|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/haanel-charles/Master-Key-System/audioEbook/master-key-systemRAW.pdf|accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The nature of the universal mind is said to be [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], and [[omnipresence|omnipresent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''The Master Key System'', by Charles Haanel, Chapter 1, section 30|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/haanel-charles/Master-Key-System/audioEbook/master-key-systemRAW.pdf|publisher=The New Thought Library|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological interpretation==
Universal mind may be viewed from a scientific perspective as [[:wikt:nonlocal|non-local]] consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu H, Wu M |date=2013 |title=Human Consciousness as Limited Version of Universal Consciousness |url=http://jcer.com/index.php/jcj/article/viewFile/281/309 |journal=Journal of Consciousness Exploration &amp; Research |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=52–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable fringe source|date=January 2017}} [[Michael Persinger]] wrote on non-local consciousness:
{{Quote|text=[a]s a human being, I am concerned about the illusionary explanations for human consciousness and the future of human existence. Consequently after writing the Neuropsychological Base of God Beliefs (1987), I began the systematic application of complex electromagnetic fields to discern the patterns that will induce experiences (sensed presence) that are attributed to the myriad of ego-alien intrusions which range from gods to aliens. The research is not to demean anyone's religious/mystical experience but instead to determine which portions of the brain or its electromagnetic patterns generate the experience|sign=[[Michael Persinger]]|source=''in Huping Hu &amp; Maoxin Wu ''}}{{Unreliable fringe source|date=January 2017}}

The atemporal nature of consciousness{{clarify|date=January 2017}} is explored by Mansoor Malik and Maria Hipolito.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Malik Monsoor |author2=Hipolito Maria |date=2010 |title=Time and its Relationship to Consciousness An Overview

{{Quote|text=Freud emphasized the timelessness of unconscious processes. He showed how unconscious ignores time and temporal progression. For example, in dreams and fantasy where past, present, and future are united in one representation, he showed that certain aspects of psychopathology are also essentially atemporal.}}

{{Quote|text=Hameroff (1996) conceptualizes consciousness as successive quantum superposition of the tubulin protein conformations in the brain. He proposes that with each conscious moment, “a new organization of Planck scale geometry is selected irreversibly”. This leads to apparent illusion of time. Thus without consciousness, there would be no time.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9108">In [[differential geometry]], the '''Weyl curvature tensor''', named after [[Hermann Weyl]], is a measure of the [[curvature]] of [[spacetime]] or, more generally, a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]].  Like the [[Riemann curvature tensor]], the Weyl tensor expresses the [[tidal force]] that a body feels when moving along a [[geodesic]].  The Weyl tensor differs from the Riemann curvature tensor in that it does not convey information on how the volume of the body changes, but rather only how the shape of the body is distorted by the tidal force.  The [[Ricci curvature]], or [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] component of the Riemann tensor contains precisely the information about how volumes change in the presence of tidal forces, so the Weyl tensor is the [[traceless]] component of the Riemann tensor. It is a [[tensor]] that has the same symmetries as the Riemann tensor with the extra condition that it be trace-free: [[Tensor contraction#Metric contraction|metric contraction]] on any pair of indices yields zero.

In [[general relativity]], the Weyl curvature is the only part of the curvature that exists in free space&amp;mdash;a solution of the [[Einstein field equation|vacuum Einstein equation]]&amp;mdash;and it governs the propagation of [[gravitational waves]] through regions of space devoid of matter.&lt;ref name="Danehkar2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Danehkar | first1=A. | date=2009 | title=On the Significance of the Weyl Curvature in a Relativistic Cosmological Model | journal=Mod. Phys. Lett. A | volume=24 | issue=38 | pages=3113–3127 | doi=10.1142/S0217732309032046 | bibcode=2009MPLA...24.3113D| arxiv=0707.2987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, the Weyl curvature is the only component of curvature for [[Ricci-flat manifold]]s and always governs the [[method of characteristics|characteristics]] of the field equations of an [[Einstein manifold]].&lt;ref name="Danehkar2009"/&gt;

In dimensions 2 and 3 the Weyl curvature tensor vanishes identically. In dimensions ≥ 4, the Weyl curvature is generally nonzero. If the Weyl tensor vanishes in dimension ≥ 4, then the metric is locally [[conformally flat]]: there exists a [[local coordinate system]] in which the metric tensor is proportional to a constant tensor.  This fact was a key component of [[Nordström's theory of gravitation]], which was a precursor of [[general relativity]].

==Definition==
The Weyl tensor can be obtained from the full curvature tensor by subtracting out various traces. This is most easily done by writing the Riemann tensor as a (0,4) valence tensor (by contracting with the metric). The (0,4) valence Weyl tensor is then {{Harv|Petersen|2006|p=92}}
&lt;math&gt;C = R - \frac{1}{n-2}\left(\mathrm{Ric} - \frac{s}{n}g\right) \wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc g - \frac{s}{2n(n-1)}g \wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc g&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' is the dimension of the manifold, ''g'' is the metric, ''R'' is the Riemann tensor, ''Ric'' is the [[Ricci tensor]], ''s'' is the [[scalar curvature]], and &lt;math&gt;h \wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc k&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Kulkarni–Nomizu product]] of two symmetric (0,2) tensors:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|&lt;math&gt;(h \wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc k)(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4) = &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;h(v_1,v_3)k(v_2,v_4)+h(v_2,v_4)k(v_1,v_3)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;{}-h(v_1,v_4)k(v_2,v_3)-h(v_2,v_3)k(v_1,v_4)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}
In full tensor notation, this can be written as 
&lt;math&gt;C_{ik\ell m}=R_{ik\ell m} + \frac{1}{n-2}\left(R_{im}g_{k\ell}  - R_{i\ell}g_{km} + R_{k\ell}g_{im} - R_{km}g_{i\ell} \right)
+ \frac{1}{(n-1)(n-2)} R \left(g_{i\ell}g_{km} - g_{im}g_{k\ell} \right).\ &lt;/math&gt;

The ordinary (1,3) valent Weyl tensor is then given by contracting the above with the inverse of the metric.

The decomposition ({{EquationNote|1}}) expresses the Riemann tensor as an [[orthogonal]] [[direct sum of vector bundles|direct sum]], in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;|R|^2 = |C|^2 + \left|\frac{1}{n-2}\left(\mathrm{Ric} - \frac{s}{n}g\right) \wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc g\right|^2 + \left|\frac{s}{2n(n-1)}g \wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc g\right|^2.&lt;/math&gt;
This decomposition, known as the [[Ricci decomposition]], expresses the Riemann curvature tensor into its [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] components under the action of the [[orthogonal group]] {{Harv|Singer|Thorpe|1968}}.  In dimension 4, the Weyl tensor further decomposes into invariant factors for the action of the [[special orthogonal group]], the self-dual and antiself-dual parts ''C''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ''C''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.

The Weyl tensor can also be expressed using the [[Schouten tensor]], which is a trace-adjusted multiple of the Ricci tensor,
:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{1}{n-2}\left(\mathrm{Ric} - \frac{s}{2(n-1)}g\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;C = R - P \wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc g.&lt;/math&gt;

In indices,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grøn|Hervik|2007|loc=p. 490}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}=R_{abcd}-\frac{2}{n-2}(g_{a[c}R_{d]b}-g_{b[c}R_{d]a})+\frac{2}{(n-1)(n-2)}R~g_{a[c}g_{d]b}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is the Riemann tensor, &lt;math&gt;R_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci tensor, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci scalar (the scalar curvature) and brackets around indices refers to the [[Antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetric part]].  Equivalently,
:&lt;math&gt;{C_{ab}}^{cd} = {R_{ab}}^{cd} - 4S_{[a}^{[c}\delta_{b]}^{d]}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' denotes the [[Schouten tensor]].

==Properties==

===Conformal rescaling===
The Weyl tensor has the special property that it is invariant under [[conformal map|conformal]] changes to the [[metric tensor|metric]]. That is, if ''g''′ = ''f g'' for some positive scalar function ''f'' then the (1,3) valent Weyl tensor satisfies ''C''′ = ''C''. For this reason the Weyl tensor is also called the '''conformal tensor'''. It follows that a [[necessary condition]] for a Riemannian manifold to be [[conformally flat]] is that the Weyl tensor vanish. In dimensions ≥ 4 this condition is [[sufficient condition|sufficient]] as well. In dimension 3 the vanishing of the [[Cotton tensor]] is a necessary and sufficient condition for the Riemannian manifold being conformally flat.  Any 2-dimensional (smooth) Riemannian manifold is conformally flat, a consequence of the existence of [[isothermal coordinates]].

Indeed, the existence of a conformally flat scale amounts to solving the overdetermined partial differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;Ddf - df\otimes df +\left(|df|^2 + \frac{\Delta f}{n-2}\right)g = \operatorname{Ric}.&lt;/math&gt;
In dimension ≥ 4, the vanishing of the Weyl tensor is the only [[integrability condition]] for this equation; in dimension 3, it is the [[Cotton tensor]] instead.

===Symmetries===
The Weyl tensor has the same symmetries as the Riemann tensor.  This includes:
:&lt;math&gt;C(u,v)=-C(v,u)^{}_{}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\langle C(u,v)w,z \rangle=-\langle C(u,v)z,w \rangle^{}_{}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C(u,v)w+C(v,w)u+C(w,u)v=0 ^{}_{}.&lt;/math&gt;
In addition, of course, the Weyl tensor is trace free:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr} C(u,\cdot)v = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''u'', ''v''.  In indices these four conditions are
:&lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}^{}=-C_{bacd}=-C_{abdc}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}+C_{acdb}+C_{adbc}^{}=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{C^a}_{bac} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Bianchi identity===
Taking traces of the usual second Bianchi identity of the Riemann tensor eventually shows that
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_a {C^a}_{bcd} = 2(n-3)\nabla_{[c}S_{d]b}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' is the [[Schouten tensor]].  The valence (0,3) tensor on the right-hand side is the [[Cotton tensor]], apart from the initial factor.

The term '''30 million word gap''' (often shortened to just the '''word gap''') was coined in a 2003 article by [[Betty Hart]] and [[Todd R. Risley]] titled "The Early Catastrophe: The 30 Million Word Gap by Age 3".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hart |first=Betty |last2=Risley |first2=Todd |date=2003 |title=The early catastrophe: The 30 million word gap by age 3 |url=http://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/TheEarlyCatastrophe.pdf |journal=American Educator |pages=4–9 |accessdate=29 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart and Risley used LENA devices, an electronic microphone that measured how many words the child hears to record samples of the utterances of entire families over 2.5 years. Families were classified by [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) into "high" (professional), "middle" (working class), and "low" (welfare) SES. They found that the average child in a professional family hears 2,153 words per waking hour, the average child in a working class family hears 1,251 words per hour, and an average child in a welfare family only 616 words per hour. Extrapolating, they stated that, "in four years, an average child in a professional family would accumulate experience with almost 45 million words, an average child in a working-class family 26 million words, and an average child in a welfare family 13 million words."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The authors found a correlation between word exposure and the rate of [[vocabulary acquisition]] in the subject children. The recordings showed that high SES toddlers spoke approximately 2 new words a day between their second and third birthdays, middle SES children 1 word per day, and low SES children 0.5 words per day. Spoken words are a measure of [[Vocabulary#Productive and receptive knowledge|productive vocabulary]]. It is thought that during children's vocabulary development the productive vocabulary mirrors their underlying [[Vocabulary development|receptive vocabulary growth]].

The authors and subsequent researchers have posited that the word gap–or certainly the differing rates of vocabulary acquisition–partially explains the [[achievement gap in the United States]], the persistent disparity in educational performance among subgroups of U.S. students, especially subgroups defined by socioeconomic status and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Valerie Strauss |title=The famous 'word gap' doesn't hurt only the young. It affects many educators, too. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/02/16/the-famous-word-gap-doesnt-hurt-only-the-young-it-affects-many-educators-too |work=Washington Post |location= |date=16 February 2015 |access-date=29 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics theorize that the language and achievement gaps are not a result of the amount of words a child is exposed to, but rather alternative theories suggest it could derive from the disconnect of linguistic practices between home and school. Thus, judging academic success and linguistic capabilities from socioeconomic may ignore bigger societal issues. The ongoing word gap discourse can be seen as a modern movement in educational discussion.

== History of language gap research ==

=== Before Hart &amp; Risley ===
Prior to the 30 million word gap study, extensive research had noted strong institutional variation in student success on standardized tests. The initial attention to achievement gap started with a 1966 publication from the [[U.S. Department of Education]] titled “Equality of Educational Opportunity.” The publication begins the onset of achievement gap by acknowledging that there is a great disparity within educational outcomes as a result of inequitable institutions, especially those that were not seen as part of the purview of schools such as cultural, socioeconomic, and linguistic realities of students at home. The National Assessment of  Educational Progress (NAEP) had further been used to census information that various studies used to show achievement gaps across a number of demographics. The idea of equity in education had also given rise to similar gap discourse around the world.

=== Hart &amp; Risley's contribution ===
Hart and Risley (2003) spent 2 ½ years observing 42 families for an hour each month to learn what typical home life was like for 1 and 2 year old children.  The families were grouped into 4 variables, upper SES, middle SES, lower SES and just a few that were on welfare. They found that by age 3 children in welfare families had a vocabulary of 525 words where children in upper SES families had vocabulary of 1,116 words. They also found that the children in upper class families were learning vocabulary at a faster rate. The researchers suggested the reason for this difference is because the welfare children heard on average 616 words per hour where professional-family children heard on average 2,153 words per hour. Thus, proposing the 30 Million Word Gap. The achievement gap is explained as a result of the language gap, in that because children are lacking in their vocabulary and literary skills, they will not be as successful in academics. Hart and Risley argue this is an indispensable societal concern because it sets the child at a disadvantage for not being exposed to more vocabulary skills at a young age.

=== Socioeconomic status studies ===
Fernald, Marchman, and Weisleder (2013) conducted a study with 48 children from diverse backgrounds ages 18–24 months old. The families were divided into low-SES (socioeconomic status) and high-SES.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Their first goal was to track developmental changes in processing efficiency in relation to vocabulary learning. Their second goal was to examine difference in aspects of early language development in relation to their SES. Their results showed that children at the same age from the lower class families had lower vocabulary scores when compared to children in higher class families. Fernald et al (2013) also found that by 18 months old language processing and vocabulary disparities were already evident, and by 24 months old there was a 6 month gap between the SES groups in processing skills critical to language development.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/desc.12019 |pmid=23432833 |pmc=3582035 |title=SES differences in language processing skill and vocabulary are evident at 18 months |journal=Developmental Science |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=234–48 |year=2013 |last1=Fernald |first1=Anne |last2=Marchman |first2=Virginia A |last3=Weisleder |first3=Adriana }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fernald et al found fast reaction time as a child can translate into reaction time as an adult. Adults who have high reaction time tend to have better memories, reasoning abilities, language skills and are better able to learn new skills (fluid intelligence). Having better processing speed means having a stronger working memory, and a stronger working memory leads to a better cognitive competence. The authors express the importance of vocabulary knowledge because it sets a foundation for later literacy and language proficiency in preschool and that is predictive of academic success. Implications of long term developmental trajectories. Thus, the issue of the language gap and achievement gap are prevalent in our youth, which can be resolved by teaching families how to work and speak with their children.

=== Educational system studies ===
Sperry, Sperry, and Miller (2018) replicated Hart and Risley’s study and found that the amount of word gaps varied within the same backgrounds of socio-economic status.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  A longitudinal study observed families with their children in their homes and the researchers spoke to the participants as if they were a family friend. They used similar social classes as HR for comparison. Middle class, working class, lower class, poor “welfare” group. During the visit, three analyses were made and transcribed for research. The first was how many words the primary caregiver spoke to the child. The second was that the words spoken by all caregivers to the child showed social class alone did not determine either the composition of households or consequently the amount of a speech a child heard. Lastly, all ambient speech, like language addressed to other individuals but overheard by language learning children was considered. In the poor community sample when you took into consideration the ambient speech, or the words that primary caregivers said to extended family, the amount of words a child hears increased by 54%, in the working class by 210%. This study was the first attempt to replicate Hart and Risley and their findings did not support the previous claims.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/cdev.13072 |title=Reexamining the Verbal Environments of Children from Different Socioeconomic Backgrounds |journal=Child Development |year=2018 |last1=Sperry |first1=Douglas E |last2=Sperry |first2=Linda L |last3=Miller |first3=Peggy J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the variation within communities was greater than when simply comparing socioeconomic statuses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Garcia and Otheguy (2016) were interested in the origins and validity of the Language Gap, and how the preconceptions of it impact bilingual and bidialectical children, specifically from Latino and Black backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They focused more so on how people talk about and understand language as a whole, especially within the education system. Their argument claims language is a semiotic process that involves sound, touch, and gestures and should be seen as a translanguaging-internalist perspective.  She offers historical context to give insight to the creation of the Language Gap and the biases it may hold. They suggest it began when ''[[Brown v. Board of Education|Brown vs The Board of Education]]'' (1954) and the [[Civil Rights Act]] (1964) made it illegal to judge based on one’s color or race; thus, exclusions needed to be made based on another trait. They build on Flores and Rosas (2017) idea of [[raciolinguistics]] that suggests a new way to separate whites and non-whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.17763/0017-8055.85.2.149 |title=Undoing Appropriateness: Raciolinguistic Ideologies and Language Diversity in Education |journal=Harvard Educational Review |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=149–71 |year=2015 |last1=Flores |first1=Nelson |last2=Rosa |first2=Jonathan }}&lt;/ref&gt; They continue to give historical context on the Achievement Gap in that it was a result of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (2001), despite its good intentions, it compared every race and background on a standardized test written in a White monolingual way.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/19313152.2016.1258190 |title=Interrogating the Language Gap of Young Bilingual and Bidialectal Students |journal=International Multilingual Research Journal |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=52–65 |year=2016 |last1=García |first1=Ofelia |last2=Otheguy |first2=Ricardo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the educational system functions on the dominant groups of society (i.e. white, Standardized English, middle-upper class), it ignores the linguistic and cultural practices of minorities. The theory here is that it is not that families of differing backgrounds are not adequate in teaching their children how to speak, but teach them a different linguistic culture at home than the one taught in schools.

Similarly, Johnson (2015) draws on from Faltis (2006) socialization mismatch hypothesis that the culture of the schooling system that is based around middle to upper class, White, Standardized English principles do not match the language socialization of backgrounds that may not fit into these categories.&lt;ref&gt;Faltis, C.F. (2005), ''Teaching English Language Learners in Elementary School Communities'' , Pearson, London.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues the Language Gap was not a result of vocabulary or literary deficiency in a child, but rather not understanding the language socialization of different cultural backgrounds. He drew from a previous linguistic anthropologist Hymes (1972) term of “communicative competence” in that social expectations within a speech community shape the member’s use of language.&lt;ref&gt;Hymes, D. (1972), “On communicative competence”, in Pride, J.B. and Holmes, J. (Eds),''Sociolinguistics'' , Penguin, London, pp. 269-285.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, diverse backgrounds in language have a different set of expectations that a member conforms to. As language differs, so does the developmental process.&lt;ref name="Johnson2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Eric J|year=2015|title=Debunking the 'language gap'|journal=Journal for Multicultural Education|volume=9|issue=1|pages=42–50|doi=10.1108/jme-12-2014-0044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson (2015) argues the Language Gap is not fair because it does not consider the various ways children use words and create meaning. Therefore, it is not the parents at fault leading their children to fall behind, but the school’s fault for not accommodating to children’s backgrounds.Thus, the Language Gap is not a result of a child’s capabilities to understand, but a result of how a linear function of language ignores the needs of the various ways to make meaning.

== Implications ==

=== Social implications ===
There are possible social implications to Hart and Risley’s theories of the issue of the Language Gap in society. The first possible implication is that this Language Gap is affecting youth’s success because they are not exposed to the same amount of vocabulary and literary skill as other kids from middle-upper classes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hart and Risely suggest that possible solutions include interventions on how to improve vocab and literary skills for caregivers in low SES. However, the second possible implication of this theory is that it ignores the fact that language and culture are taught differently. In stating other backgrounds cannot be as successful as the dominant groups in society, It reinstates the homogeneity of language, in that it proposes one “true” way of speaking.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Garcia and Otheguy (2016) implies the Language and Achievement Gap derive from racist ideals that reinforce the idea that some cultures are seen as “disadvantaged”. To place the blame on different backgrounds is to invalidate their way to make meaning just because they have different cultures. Thus, to not consider the responsibility of the schooling system is to promote the homogeneity of Standardized English and this notion that anyone who doesn’t speak or understand it is inferior and prone to future failure. Garcia argues it deligitimatizes backgrounds of families and their linguistic and cultural practices because it is not seen to be “successful” in the eyes of the education system.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Political implications ===
Sperry, Sperry and Miller discussed some of the consequences of the original Hart and Risley (2003) article. The 30 Million Word Gap has received widespread media attention. In 2013 Bloomberg Philanthropies mayors challenge awarded providence Rhode Island its grand prize to “providence talks” - a project proposed to teach poor parents how to speak to their children with the aid of the LENA Device. The Clinton foundations “Too Small to Fail” initiative which hosted the White House Word Gap event in 2014, resulted in the US department of Health and Human services funding remedial efforts to address the Word Gap.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In addition, Georgia has a policy “Talk with Me Baby” that is a public action strategy aimed at increasing the number of words children are exposed to in early childhood. "Talk With Me Baby" is a program that provides professional development of nurses, who will then coach new parents how they should talk to their children. This program is funded by Greater United Way of Atlanta.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The University of Chicago, School of Medicine's Thirty Million Words Initiative provides intervention for caregivers and teaches to show them how to optimize their talk with their kids. This program is funded by the PNC Foundation.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Shankar, M. (2014) Empowering our children by bridging the word gap. ''The White House President Barack Obama'' retrieved from: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/06/25/empowering-our-children-bridging-word-gap&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gap discourse ===
The Word Gap theory can be seen as part of a larger development in modern educational reform and movement: the [[Achievement gap in the United States|Achievement Gap]] discourse. It is widely accepted and noted by scholars that ideas around individual outcome in schools varies based on various demographics. Explaining variations in achievement in schools across levels of demographics that may result in a gap in student achievement has become the primary problems  public schools have to address. The Discourse is based on evidence and assumptions of why primarily poor students of color do not perform at the same levels as their more affluent White and certain Asian group counterparts- it creates language to how schools and communities can be organized more optimally to help students and schools produce more equitable and successful outcomes. The Achievement Gap also addresses a gender gap achievement, and standardized test score gaps broadly across countries, notably with standardized examinations on STEM subjects. The Discourse can also be seen as a turning away from traditional explanations of performance in school as individualistic, to the creation of cultural framework understanding to help explain what conventions hinder and produce successful students. ''Under performing, adequate yearly progress (AYP), highly qualified, below basic, and proficient'' are some terms used to mark good and bad aspects of schools, their teachers, and their students which in turn reifies the Achievement Gap theory. As a broader Discourse, it is an idea which is multimodally shared and accepted as common belief between parents, policy makers, teachers and students through various means according to [[James Paul Gee]]’s idea of Discourse in socio-linguistic analysis.&lt;ref name="Carey2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carey|first1=Roderick L|year=2013|title=A Cultural Analysis of the Achievement Gap Discourse|journal=Urban Education|volume=49|issue=4|pages=440–68|doi=10.1177/0042085913507459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of the Achievement Gap Discourse cause several cultural phenomena- “cultural gate-keeping,” in which policy makers and education reformers decide and label students as more or less capable and worthy than others. Schools might be called under-performing, which can further affect the policy and financing prescribed by their districts, or even higher authorities.&lt;ref name=Carey2013/&gt;

Using metric standards to understand the cause in Achievement Gap as a result of ineffective cultural practices also tends to place blame on the families unless there is ample socio-linguistic inquiry to individual family circumstance, which still often creates a Discourse against deemed underachieving students’ culture.

The Achievement Gap Discourse initiated with two primary modes in American educational studies: Achievement Gap among races, and gap among socioeconomic status (SES). ''The gap Discourse'' does not typically extend across generations or other forms of demographics that have been studied, and further study of Achievement Gap among different dimensions faces the initial stigmatization as a result of the gap Discourse in various studies around the turn of the 21st Century, pin-headed by the 30 million Word Gap. Among critics are many linguists, anthropologists, and social discipline specialists, as well as organizations such as the Linguistic Society of America.&lt;ref name="Johnson2015" /&gt;

The achievement gap became an especially strong interest for study in the turn of the century, and the early 2000's when a plethora of studies looked at factors such as standardized test scores, presence in class, GPA, enrollment, and dropout rates in secondary and post-secondary education. The problem came in the analyses of the studies which were  criticized for looking at race and socioeconomic explanations to explain educational outcome without taking into account others such as S. J. Lee, 2005, Pang, Kiang, &amp; Pak, 2004, and Rothstein 2004 which provided broad postulations as to why race and SES accounted for varied success.&lt;ref&gt;Pang, V. O., Kiang, P. N., &amp; Pak, Y. K. (2004). Asian Pacific American students: Challenging a biased educational system. In J. A. Banks &amp; C. A. M. Banks (Eds.), Handbook of research on multicultural education (2nd ed., pp. 542-563). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, T. (2003). Up from the parched earth: Toward a theory of African American achievement. In T. Perry, C. Steele, &amp; A. G. Hilliard III (Eds.), Young, gifted and Black: Promoting high achievement among African-American students (pp. 1-108). Boston, MA: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, S. J. (2005). Up against whiteness: Race, school and immigrant youth. New York, NY: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; President George W. Bush's administration’s [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind]] rhetoric of 2001 and 2002 left researchers limited to the type of research they could conduct for educational equity due to a need to appease policy makers among educational stakeholders. According to Roderick L Carey, Word Gap researcher, the NCLB “mandated objective and quantitative ‘scientifically based’ research, which left little room for qualitative research agendas that unpack contextual factors that add nuance to the understandings of how high-stakes accountability is felt and lived by students, teachers, and their families.”&lt;ref name=Carey2013/&gt; The rhetoric also posed ideas that placed responsibility of achievement in institutions on their most proximal function oriented members, shifting responsibility to achieve positive outcomes on high-stakes standardized tests nearly entirely on teachers and schools, whilst the difference in achievement was largely believed to be due to factors outside of the classroom. Various studies culminated to suggest general and vague underlying problems within specific communities which caused deficit in learning outcomes under this context.

Among these studies, Hart and Risley  stumbled upon the idea of word gap when working with youth who used cochlear implants, to form their the idea: they hypothesized exposure to spoken word might explain an achievement gap in standardized test scores, then used standardized testing data on language as well as an in depth study to conclude their 30 million word gap publication.

== Additional information ==

=== Word Gap internationally ===
The ''Oxford Word Gap'' is used to describe the word gap found between races and socioeconomic classes in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Carey2013/&gt; The report study “Why Closing the Word Gap Matters: Oxford Language Report” details out statistics collected in primary and secondary schools in the United Kingdom, along the same ideas as the American Word Gap idea, citing ''Hart and Risley (2003)'' in the report. It was published in 2018, so all of its implications are yet to be seen.

A great number of states have paid attention to Achievement Gap across hundreds of criteria including demographics, access to language and economic resources and race around the world: notably in the United Kingdom, France, South Africa as named in one comparative analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fulcher |first1=Taylor J. |title=A Comparative Analysis of the Racial and Class Achievement Gap in Schooling in the United States, France, and South Africa |year=2015 |series=Senior Honors Projects |volume=108 |url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/honors201019/108 |type=Thesis }}{{page needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] has held strongly in its principles the importance on aspects of educational equity, and other educational movements similar to that of the United States Word Gap are numerous throughout Europe and some other members of UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14664208.2014.979649 |title=Language rights and language policy: Addressing the gap(s) between principles and practices |journal=Current Issues in Language Planning |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=355–9 |year=2014 |last1=May |first1=Stephen }}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe also has its own varied standards on the ideas of multilingual competence per state, which stress the apprehension and exposure to secondary language vocabulary in students of all ages.

=== Other Word Gaps ===
The Word Gap has largely been defined to mean the idea of the observed gap between the spoken and read language in the specific context of American education reform described in this article, however other proposed ideas or active research have used it to describe differences in access to language varieties experienced in public settings, such as signage in Orellana, 2017's ''Another Type of Word Gap'', as well as other linguistic resources such as using media for language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Orellana, M. F. (2017, December 07). A Different Kind of Word Gap. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/marjorie-faulstich-orellana/a-different-kind-of-word-_b_10030876.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other aspects of linguistic resource studies could change the language or may attempt to use terms to remain distinct from the stigma of word gap.

A '''wrong''' (from [[Old English]] ''wrang ''– ''crooked'')&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|chapter=crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an act that is illegal or [[immoral]].&lt;ref name="oxdic"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of Law|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198607563|author=Elizabeth A. Martin|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Legal wrongs''' are usually quite clearly defined in the [[law]] of a [[State (polity)|state]] and/or [[jurisdiction]]. They can be divided into [[civil wrong]]s and [[crime]]s (or ''criminal offences'') in [[Common law (legal system)|common law]] countries,&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt; while [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries tend to have some additional categories, such as [[contraventions]].

'''[[Morality|Moral]] wrong''' is an underlying concept for legal wrong. Some moral wrongs are punishable by law, for example, [[rape]] or [[murder]].&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt; Other moral wrongs have nothing to do with law. On the other hand, some legal wrongs, such as parking  offences, could hardly be classified as moral wrongs.&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt;

==Legal wrong==
In law, a wrong can be a legal [[injury]], which is any damage resulting from a violation of a [[legal right]]. A legal wrong can also imply the state of being contrary to the principles of justice or law. It means that something is contrary to conscience or morality and results in treating others unjustly. If the loss caused by a wrong is minor enough, there is no compensation, which principle is known as ''[[De minimis|de minimis non curat lex]]''. Otherwise, damages apply.

The law of England recognised the concept of a "wrong" before it recognised the distinction between [[civil wrong]]s (governed by [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]]) and [[crime]]s (defined by [[criminal law]]), which distinction was developed during the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]], [[A First Book of English Law]], Sweet and Maxwell, 4th ed., 1960, pp. 207, 208, 213&lt;/ref&gt;
