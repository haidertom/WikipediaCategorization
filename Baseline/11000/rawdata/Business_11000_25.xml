The '''Advertising Research Foundation''' (ARF) is a nonprofit [[trade association|industry association]] for creating, aggregating, synthesizing and sharing knowledge in the fields of [[advertising]] and [[mass media|media]]. It was founded in 1936 by the [[Association of National Advertisers]] and the [[American Association of Advertising Agencies]]. Its stated mission is to improve the practice of [[advertising]], [[marketing]] and media research in pursuit of more effective marketing and advertising communications. Its membership consists of over 400 [[advertiser]]s, [[Advertising agency|advertising agencies]], research firms, [[Media proprietor|media companies]], educational institutions and international organizations.&lt;ref name="AllBusiness"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

The ARF conducts several research initiatives. It publishes the ''Journal of Advertising Research'', a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] academic [[periodical]]. It also sponsors a variety of advertising-related [[marketing research]] endeavours and hosts periodic conferences on advertising and media-related topics. The ARF operates the ''Roy Morgan Information Center'' as a clearinghouse for advertising research, promulgating industry standards and guidelines, and it provides training and administers the annual ''[[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]] Awards Program''.

The ARF has a '''Knowledge Center''' which houses historical reports, papers and videos developed during the formative years of the advertising research industry which are not available anywhere else. Established in 1953 to serve as a central resource for the wealth of materials relating to advertising research, the ARF Knowledge Center also offers specialized tools and services to help ARF members keep up-to-date with the latest knowledge that is applicable to their business needs.

== History ==
The Advertising Research Agency was formed in 1936.  During its first 15 years, ARF sponsored over 200 studies including studies involving newspapers, farm magazines, business magazines, and an executive management publication.

In the beginning of the 1950s the ARF began working with media companies in addition to advertisers and agencies.  The agency supervised a study on household ownership of radio &amp; television sets in 1954.  It also published "Recommended Standards for Radio &amp; Television Program Audience Size Measurements," in 1954.  In 1955 the ARF influenced the U.S. Census Bureau to include a TV ownership question in its questionnaires.  Research companies were invited to become ARF members in 1967.

&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, the ARF spearheaded notable [[primary research]] in studies such as the ''Copy Research Validity Project'', which redefined the area of [[copy testing]], and the ''ARF/Ad Council Study'' to determine the impact of [[public service advertising]].&lt;ref name="AllBusiness"/&gt; More recently, the ARF has pioneered efforts to define [[Engagement (marketing)|advertising engagement]] and to measure consumers' emotional responses to advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A bill of sale is a document that transfers ownership of goods from one person to another. It is used in situations where the former owner transfers possession of the goods to a new owner. Bills of sale may be used in a wide variety of transactions: people can sell their goods, exchange them, give them as gifts or mortgage them to get a loan. They can only be used:
* to transfer ownership of goods that people already own;
* to transfer ownership of moveable tangible goods; and
* by individuals and unincorporated businesses.
Bills of sale exist at [[common law]] quite independently of any legislation. In England and Wales, they are regulated by two Victorian pieces of legislation: the Bills of Sale Act 1878 and the Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882. This area of the law was subject to review by the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]], which published a proposal for change in 2017.&lt;ref name=lawcom-20171123&gt;{{cite report |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/662596/PRINT_-_From_Bills_of_Sale_to_Goods_Mortgages.pdf |title=From Bills of Sale to Goods Mortgages |isbn=978-1-5286-0110-8 |publisher=House of Commons |work=Law Commission |id=HC 495/Law Com No 376 |date=23 November 2017 |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bills of sale in the US ==

===Historical origin===
The term “bill of sale” originally referred to any writing by which an absolute disposition of personalty for value was effected or evidenced. A common feature of such dispositions is that the owner mortgagor remains in possession and exercises all the attendant rights of ownership, which may be so overwhelming as to induce a third party to accept the same chattel as a security for a grant, albeit without notice of the first mortgagee. This scenario made the bill of sale a veritable tool of fraud.

The evolution of various bills of sale laws, within the USA, was to curb the use of the bill of sale as a means of defrauding innocent persons. The first of such being the [[Bills of Sale Act 1854]] which was repealed and re-enacted by the [[Bills of Sale Act 1878]] which was almost on all fours with the 1854 act. Further developments led to the enactment of the [[Bills of Sale Act 1882]].

A bill of sale has been defined as a legal document made by the seller to a purchaser, reporting that on a specific date at a specific locality and for a particular sum of money or other value received, the seller sold to the purchaser a specific item of personal property, or parcel of real property of which he had lawful possession . The Black’s Law Dictionary  on its part defines a bill of sale as “an instrument for the conveyance of title to personal property, absolutely or by way of security”. According to Omotola the bill of sale is “a form of legal mortgage of chattels”. Bullen and Leake and Jacobs define a bill of sale as “a document transferring a proprietary interest in personal chattels from one individual (the “grantor”) to another (the “grantee”), without possession being delivered to the grantee”.

In essence, a bill of sale is a written instrument showing the voluntary transfer of a right or interest or title to personal property, either by way of security or absolutely, from one person to another without the actual physical possession of the property leaving the owner and being delivered to the other party. It is clear from the definitions above that the bills of sale are essentially of two types: The absolute bill of sale and the conditional bill of sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.documatica-forms.com/usa/bill-of-sale/more-info.php |title=What is a USA Bill of Sale or Documented Sales Receipt? |deadurl=no |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The absolute bill of sale===
Absolute bills of sale, which do not represent any form of security whatsoever, are simply documents evidencing assignments, transfers and other assurances of personal chattels, which are substantially no more than mere [[contract of sale|contracts of sale]] of goods covered by the common law of contract and the sale of goods law.

===The conditional bill of sale===
The conditional bill of sale refers to any assignment or transfer of personal chattels to a person by way of security for the payment of money.  The conditional bill of sale creates a security in favour of the grantee of the bill whereby the grantee is given personal right of seizure giving right to a security interest of a possessory nature.

There are other forms of security over goods such as a pledge and contractual lien which also only give right to a security interest of a possessory nature.

An example of a conditional bill of sale can be found where a creditor gives a loan and has transferred to himself, as collateral or security for the loan, the title of the goods or other personal property of the debtor. The physical goods or other property however remains with the debtor.

== Bills of sale in England and Wales ==

=== Historical perspective ===
Bills of sale have existed at common law since at least the [[Middle Ages]], when they were most commonly used commercially in the shipping industry. As the general population began to own more personal goods in the [[Victorian era]], bills of sale came to be used as a form of consumer credit. Lenders would extend credit on the security of:&lt;blockquote&gt;''all and every the household goods, furniture, plate, linen, china, books, stock in trade, brewing utensils and all the effects.''&lt;ref&gt;J Weir, "The Law of Bills of Sale" (1896) p.23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Most often, people would grant bills of sale over their goods as security for a loan. Borrowers would transfer ownership of their goods to the lender, while retaining possession of them when making repayments. When the loan was repaid, the borrower would regain ownership. Bills of sale used in this way are known as “security bills”.

Sometimes, bills of sale would transfer ownership outright, such as when a person sold their goods to another while retaining possession. Bills of sale used for purposes other than borrowing money are known as “absolute bills”.

=== Bills of Sale Acts ===
The increased use of bills of sale in the Victorian era created a “false wealth” problem. Potential purchasers and other lenders could be misled into thinking that the person in possession of goods still owned them. The person in possession could sell the goods or use them to secure another loan. In both cases, the transaction was fraudulent, but the purchaser or lender had no way of discovering that the goods were already subject to a bill of sale.

As a result, Parliament passed the Bills of Sale Act 1878. This largely replicated the provisions of an earlier Bills of Sale Act 1854. It requires all bills of sale to be registered at the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] so that interested third parties could check whether the person in possession has already transferred away ownership of goods.&lt;ref name=lawcom-20171123/&gt;

The Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882 had a different purpose. The 1878 Act led to a rise in the use of security bills. Concerns were expressed that such transactions could lead “thousands of honest and respectable people to their ruin”.&lt;ref name=hansard-1882&gt;Hansard (HC), 20 March 1882, vol 267, cc1398-416.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament noted that:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Many money-lenders advertised under the names of fictitious banks; and sometimes they advertised in this form – “A widow, with capital to spare, will be happy to lend on easy terms. Strict secrecy. Five per cent.”… Having entrapped a man into his office, the money-lender proceeded in this way – He produced a bill of sale containing a large number of clauses, which it was impossible for the borrower to read or understand in the time allowed...&lt;ref name=hansard-1882/&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;In response, Parliament enacted the 1882 Act, which was an early attempt at consumer protection.

Both the 1878 Act and the 1882 Act remain in force today. Absolute bills are regulated only by the 1878 Act. Security bills are regulated by the 1882 Act and the 1878 Act, to the extent that its provisions are consistent with those of the 1882 Act.

=== Bills of sale in the 21st century ===
In the twenty-first century, bills of sale are overwhelmingly used in the form of so-called “[[Logbook loan|logbook loans]]”.&lt;ref name=lawcom-2015&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/app/uploads/2015/09/cp225_bills_of_sale.pdf |title=Bills of Sale - A Consultation Paper |id=Consultation Paper No 225 |publisher=Law Commission |year=2015 |isbn=9780108561702 |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} These are security bills secured on the borrower’s vehicle. Borrowers transfer ownership of their car, van or motorcycle to the logbook lender as security for the loan. While making repayments, borrowers keep possession of their vehicle and continue to use it. Borrowers hand the logbook lender the V5C registration document – or “logbook” – but this is purely symbolic and has no legal effect.

=== Criticism and reform of the law ===
The law of bills of sale has been criticised on a number of occasions. The Crowther report in 1971&lt;ref&gt;Report of the committee on consumer credit (1971) Cmnd 4596.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Diamond report in 1986&lt;ref&gt;A Diamond, ''A review of security interests in property'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; both considered the Acts, with the latter recommending repeal. 

In its consultation paper, the Law Commission made a number of criticisms of the law as it stood in 2015. It proposed to replace the Bills of Sale Acts with a new Goods Mortgages Act.&lt;ref name=lawcom-2015/&gt;{{rp|71}}

In its consultation paper, the Law Commission identified five key problems with the Bills of Sale Acts:
* undue complexity;
* highly technical documentation;
* the registration regime is in need of modernisation;
* they offer little protection to borrowers;
* they offer no protection to third party purchasers.&lt;ref name=lawcom-2015/&gt;{{rp|7}}
The Law Commission proposed to replace the Bills of Sale Acts with a new Goods Mortgage Act that would address each of the criticisms identified in the consultation paper.&lt;ref name=lawcom-20171123/&gt;

'''''Boys in the Pits: Child Labour in Coal Mines''''' is a 2000 book by Robert McIntosh, published by [[McGill-Queen's University Press]]. The book is about [[child labour]] in Canada in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with special reference to the history of boys, aged 8 to 15, who worked in [[coal mines]]. These boys worked underground, leading horses along subterranean roads, manipulating ventilation doors, helping miners cut and lift tons of coal, and filling wagons with freshly mined coal.&lt;ref name=boys&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/03/bookrevs.htm Book reviews]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/0424 Boys in the Pits: Child Labour in Coal Mines]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chemical engineering}}
In a [[Process (science)|scientific]] sense, a '''chemical process''' is a method or means of somehow changing one or more [[chemical]]s or [[chemical compound]]s. Such a chemical process can occur by itself or be caused by an outside force, and involves a [[chemical reaction]] of some sort. In an "[[Process (engineering)|engineering]]" sense, a chemical process is a method intended to be used in [[manufacturing]] or on an industrial scale (see [[Industrial process]]) to change the composition of chemical(s) or material(s), usually using technology similar or related to that used in [[chemical plant]]s or the [[chemical industry]].  

Neither of these definitions are exact in the sense that one can always tell definitively what is a chemical process and what is not; they are practical definitions.  There is also significant overlap in these two definition variations.   Because of the inexactness of the definition, chemists and other scientists use the term "chemical process" only in a general sense or in the engineering sense.  However, in the "process (engineering)" sense, the term "chemical process" is used extensively.  The rest of the article will cover the engineering type of chemical process.  

Although this type of chemical process may sometimes involve only one step, often multiple steps, referred to as [[unit operation]]s, are involved.  In a [[Factory|plant]],   each of the unit operations commonly occur in individual vessels or sections of the plant called '''units'''.  Often, one or more [[chemical reaction]]s are involved, but other ways of changing chemical (or material) composition may be used, such as [[Mixing (process engineering)|mixing]] or [[separation process]]es.  The process steps may be sequential in time or sequential in space along a stream of flowing or moving material; see [[Chemical plant#Continuous and batch operation|Chemical plant]].  For a given amount of a feed (input) material or product (output) material, an expected amount of material can be determined at key steps in the process from empirical data and material balance calculations.  These amounts can be scaled up or down to suit the desired capacity or operation of a particular chemical plant built for such a process.  More than one chemical plant may use the same chemical process, each plant perhaps at differently scaled capacities.  
Chemical processes like [[distillation]] and [[crystallization]] go back to [[alchemy]] in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]].

Such chemical processes can be illustrated generally as '''[[Block diagram|block flow diagram]]s''' or in more detail as '''[[process flow diagram]]s'''.  Block flow diagrams show the units as blocks and the streams flowing between them as connecting lines with arrowheads to show direction of flow.   

In addition to chemical plants for producing chemicals, chemical processes with similar technology and equipment are also used in [[Oil refinery|oil refining]] and other [[Refining|refineries]], [[natural gas processing]], [[polymer]] and [[pharmaceutical]] manufacturing, [[food processing]], and [[water]] and [[wastewater treatment]].

==Unit processing in chemical process==
'''Unit processing''' is the basic processing in [[chemical engineering]].  Together with [[unit operation]]s it forms the main principle of the varied chemical industries.  Each genre of unit processing follows the same chemical law much as each genre of [[unit operation]]s follows the same physical law.

Chemical engineering unit processing consists of the following important processes:

*[[Oxidation]]
*[[Redox|Reduction]]
*[[Hydrogenation]]
*[[Dehydrogenation]]
*[[Hydrolysis]]
*[[Hydration reaction|Hydration]]
*[[Dehydration reaction|Dehydration]]
*[[Halogenation]]
*[[Nitrification]]
*[[Sulfonation]]
*[[Ammoniation]]
*[[Alkaline fusion]]
*[[Alkylation]]
*[[Dealkylation]]
*[[Esterification]]
*[[Polymerization]]
*[[Polycondensation]]
*[[Catalysis]]

'''Collaborative decision-making (CDM) software''' is a [[software]] application or module that helps to coordinate and disseminate data and reach consensus among work groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1109/hicss.1999.772703 |chapter=Computer-mediated collaborative decision making: Theoretical and implementation issues |title=Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences. 1999. HICSS-32. Abstracts and CD-ROM of Full Papers |pages=10 |year=1999 |last1=Naracapilidis |first1=N. |last2=Papadias |first2=D. |last3=Pappis |first3=C. |isbn=0-7695-0001-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CDM software coordinates the functions and features required to arrive at timely [[Group decision-making|collective decisions]], enabling all relevant stakeholders to participate in the process. 

The selection of communication tools is very important for high end collaborative efforts. Online collaboration tools are very different from one another, some use older forms of Internet-based Managing and working in virtual teams is not any task but it is being done for decades now. The most important factor for any virtual team is decision making. All the [[virtual team]]s have to discuss, analyze and find solutions to problems through continuous brain storming session collectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An emerging enhancement in the integration of social networking and [[business intelligence]] (BI), has drastically improvised the decision making by directly linking the information on BI systems with collectively gathered inputs from [[social software]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Nowadays all the organizations are dependent on business intelligence (BI) tools so that their employers can make better decisions based on the processed information in tools.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The application of [[social software]] in [[Business Intelligence|business intelligence]] (BI) to the decision-making process provides a significant opportunity to tie [[information]] directly to the decisions made throughout the company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History ==
Technology scientists and researchers have worked and explored automated [[Decision support system|decision Support Systems]] (DSS) for around 40 years.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-29272-4_3 |chapter=A Critical Analysis of Decision Support Systems Research Revisited: The Rise of Design Science |title=Enacting Research Methods in Information Systems |pages=43 |year=2016 |last1=Arnott |first1=David |last2=Pervan |first2=Graham |isbn=978-3-319-29271-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research initiated with building model-driven DSS in the late 1960s. Advanced with usage of financial related planning systems, spreadsheet-based decision Support Systems and group decision support systems(GDSS) started in the early and mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/249703 |jstor=249703 |title=Revisiting DSS Implementation Research: A Meta-Analysis of the Literature and Suggestions for Researchers |journal=MIS Quarterly |volume=16 |pages=95 |year=1992 |last1=Alavi |first1=Maryam |last2=Joachimsthaler |first2=Erich A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Data warehouse]]s, managerial Information Systems, [[online analytical processing]](OLAP) and business Intelligence emerged in late 1980s and mid-1990s and around same time the knowledge driven DSS and the usage of [[web-based]] DSS were evolving significantly. The field of automated decision support is emerging to utilize new advancements and create new applications.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In the 1960s, scientists deliberately started examining the utilization of automated quantitative models to help with basic decision making and planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1287/mnsc.12.8.b363 |title=Use of the Time-Sharing Computer in Business Planning and Budgeting |journal=Management Science |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=B–363 |year=1966 |last1=Raymond |first1=R. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Automated decision support systems have become more of real time scenarios with the advancement of [[minicomputer]]s, timeshare working frameworks and distributed computing. The historical backdrop of the execution of such frameworks starts in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1287/opre.36.6.823 |title=Introduction—Special Focus and Decision Support Systems (DSS) |journal=Operations Research |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=823 |year=1988 |last1=Gray |first1=Paul |last2=Lenstra |first2=Jan Karel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a technology field as assorted as DSS, chronicling history is neither slick nor direct. Diverse individuals see the field of decision Support Systems from different vantage focuses and report distinctive records of what happened and what was important.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Power, D. J. |title=Specifying an Expanded Framework for Classifying and Describing Decision Support Systems |journal=Communications of the Association for Information Systems |volume=13 |pages=158–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; As technology emerged new automated decision support applications were created and worked upon. Scientists utilized multiple frameworks to create and comprehend these applications. Today one can arrange the historical backdrop of DSS into the five expansive DSS classes, including: communications-driven, data-driven, document driven, knowledge-driven and model-driven decision support systems.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Model-driven [[spatial decision support system]] (SDSS) was developed in the late 1980s and by 1995 the SDSS idea had turned out to be recognized in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/0167-9236(94)00018-n |title=Spatial decision support systems: An overview of technology and a test of efficacy |journal=Decision Support Systems |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=219 |year=1995 |last1=Crossland |first1=M.D. |last2=Wynne |first2=B.E. |last3=Perkins |first3=W.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data driven spatial DSS are also quite regular. All in all, a data-driven DSS stresses access to and control of a time-series of internal organization information and sometimes external and current data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1109/icnit.2010.5508466 |chapter=OLAP and OLTP data integration for operational level decision making |title=2010 International Conference on Networking and Information Technology |pages=493 |year=2010 |last1=Muhammad Azhar Chohan |last2=Muhammad Younus Javed |isbn=978-1-4244-7579-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Executive information system|Executive Information Systems]] are cases of data driven DSS.The very first cases of these frameworks were called data-oriented DSS, [[Information system|analysis Information Systems]] and recovery.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bonczek |first=R. H. |first2=C.W. |last2=Holsapple |first3=A.B. |last3=Whinston |title=Foundations of Decision Support Systems |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communications-driven DSS utilize networks and communications technologies to facilitate decision-relevant collaboration and communication. In these frameworks, communications technologies are the overwhelming design segment. Devices utilized incorporate [[groupware]], video conferencing and computer-based bulletin boards.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 1989, [[Lotus Software|Lotus]] presented a groupware application called Notes and expanded the focus of GDSS to incorporate upgrading communication, collaboration and coordination among gatherings of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1145/46157.46158 |title=Computer-based systems for cooperative work and group decision making |journal=ACM Computing Surveys |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=115 |year=1988 |last1=Kraemer |first1=Kenneth L. |last2=King |first2=John Leslie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, [[groupware]], [[Bulletin Boards|bulletin boards]], audio and videoconferencing are the essential advancements for communications-driven decision support. In the last couple of years, voice and video started utilizing the Internet convention and have incredibly extended the conceivable outcomes for synchronous communications-driven DSS.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A document driven DSS utilizes PC storage and processing technologies to give record recovery and investigation. Huge archived [[database]]s may incorporate examined reports, hypertext records, pictures, sounds and video. Content and record administration expanded in the 1970s and 1980s as a critical, generally utilized automated means for presenting and preparing bits of content.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Cases of archives that may be retrieved by a document driven DSS are strategies and techniques, item determinations, catalogs and corporate verifiable reports, including minutes of meetings and correspondence. A search engine is an essential decision-aiding tool connected with document-driven DSS.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Knowledge-driven DSS can propose or prescribe actions to managers. These DSS are individual PC frameworks with specific critical thinking ability risen. The "expertise" comprises knowledge around a specific area, comprehension of issues inside that space, and "skill" at taking care of some of these issues.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These frameworks have been called suggestion DSS and knowledge-based DSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5915.1992.tb00448.x |title=The Emergence of Artificial Intelligence as a Reference Discipline for Decision Support Systems Research |journal=Decision Sciences |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=1263 |year=1992 |last1=Goul |first1=Michael |last2=Henderson |first2=John C. |last3=Tonge |first3=Fred M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web based DSS, starting in roughly 1995, the far reaching Web and worldwide Internet gave an innovation stage to encourage developing the abilities and sending of automated choice support. The arrival of the [[HTML]] 2. details with shape labels and tables was a defining moment in the advancement of web-based DSS. In 1995, various papers were introduced on utilizing the Web and Internet for choice support at the third International conference of the International society for decision support systems (ISDSS). Notwithstanding web-based, model-driven DSS, analysts were reporting web access to [[data warehouse]]s. DSS Research Resources was begun as an online gathering of bookmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Berners-Lee |first=T. |date=August 1996 |title=The World Wide Web: Past, Present and Future |url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/1996/ppf.html |website=w3.org |accessdate=November 5, 2016 |volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1995, the [[World Wide Web]] was perceived by various programming designers and scholastics as a genuine stage for executing a wide range of decision-support systems.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bhargava |first1=H. |first2=D.J. |last2=Power |chapter=Decision Support Systems and Web Technologies: A Status Report |title=Proceedings of the 2001 Americas Conference on Information Systems, Boston, MA, November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996-97, corporate [[intranet]]s were produced to support information exchange and knowledge management. The primary decision-support apparatuses included specially appointed question and reporting instruments, improvement and recreation models, [[online analytical processing|online analytical processing (OLAP)]], [[data mining]] and [[data visualization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dmreview.com |last=Powell |first=R. |title=DM Review: A 10 Year Journey |work=DM Review |date=February 2001 |accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enterprise wide DSS utilizing database technologies were particularly well known among large organizations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In 1999, sellers presented new Web-based analytical applications. Numerous DBMS merchants moved their center to web-based analytical applications and [[business intelligence]] solutions. In 2000, [[application service provider]]s (ASPs) started facilitating the [[application programming]] and specialized foundation for decision support capabilities. Additionally the year 2000 was a gateway. More advanced "enterprise knowledge portals" were presented by sellers that combined information portals, [[knowledge management]], [[business intelligence]], and communications-driven DSS in an integrated web environment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Decision support applications and research concentrates on identified data-oriented systems, management expert systems, multidimensional data analysis, query and reporting tools, online analytical processing (OLAP), business Intelligence, group DSS, conferencing and groupware, document management, spatial DSS and executive Information Systems as the technologies rise, meet and wander.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The investigation of decision support systems is a connected train that utilizes learning and particularly hypothesis from different disciplines. Consequently, numerous DSS scientists look into inquiries that have been analyzed on the grounds that they were of worry to individuals who were building and utilizing particular DSS. Subsequently, a great part of the wide DSS information base gives speculations and headings to building more powerful DSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baskerville |first=R. |last2=Myers |first2=M. |year=2016 |title=Information Systems as a Reference Discipline |journal=MIS Quarterly |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=1–14 |jstor=4132338 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social and collaborative business intelligence (BI) were popularly recognized as a sub category with in BI work space in the year 2009.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Software as a service (SaaS) as a standard component of their BI portfolio |journal=Business Intelligence Predictions for 2009 and Beyond}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social and collaborative BI, a type of CDM software, harnesses the functions and philosophies of social networking and social Web 2.0 technologies, applying them to reporting and analytics at the enterprise level, to facilitate better and faster fact-based decision-making.This platform, such as Web 2.0 technologies, is designed around the premise that anyone should be able to share content and contribute to discussion, anywhere and anytime&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since 2010 there is an inclination to consolidate highlights from informal organizations into Business Intelligence arrangements. A wide range of business applications ought to likewise take after this crucial change in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zaraté |first=P. |year=2013 |title=Tools for collaborative decision-making |location=London |publisher=ISTE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International Data Corporation]](IDC) predicted that 2011 would be the year where the trend of embedding social media style features into BI solutions would make its mark, and that virtually all types of business applications would undergo a fundamental transformation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=IDC, Determining the Value of Social Business ROI |journal=Myths, Facts and Potentially High Returns, IDC |volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; IDC also believed the emerging CDM software market would grow quickly, forecasting revenues of nearly $2 billion by 2014, with a compound annual growth rate of 38.2 percent between the years 2009 and 2014.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; CDM software, in the context of BI, is the ability to share and institutionalize information, analysis and insight, which would otherwise be lost.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1108/03055720710838498 |title=Data‐driven decision making for the enterprise: An overview of business intelligence applications |journal=VINE |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=414 |year=2007 |last1=Hedgebeth |first1=Darius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Business intelligence|Business Intelligence]] (BI) has been broadly utilized to oversee and refine incomprehensible supplies of information.Many organizations have applied business Intelligence in their firms in order to refine their own data for better understanding and decision making. BI also has its applications in statistical analysis, [[predictive modelling]] and [[optimization]]. The different reports generated by these products play a major role in decision making. Decision Making is an important task in the job as the consequences of a decision effect the growth and performance of the organization.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The effects of personality traits on business intelligence usage: A decision-making perspective |journal=Malaysian Journal of Library &amp; Information Science |volume=20 |issue=2 |year=2015 |pages=13–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) joins social programming with business insight. This mix can drastically enhance the nature of basic decision making by specifically connecting the data contained in BI frameworks with collective information gathered using social programming.User associations could cobble together such a framework with existing social programming, BI stages and essential labeling usefulness.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; CDM is a rising segment of numerous application sorts - including BI, [[human resources]](HR), ability administration and suites - however it is likewise a conduct realized by the utilization of Web 2.0 applications. In the vanguard of this pattern is the way that BI is being incorporated with shared, [[cloud-based]] applications.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Virtual world Second Life is additionally rising as a stage for collaborative decision making. The key advantage of this is "breaking down space" and the capacity to mix synchronous and asynchronous exercises. For meetings and occasions, the advantages of having all the significant data and individuals on request, which evacuates the limitations of timetable and geology.[[Service-oriented architecture|Service oriented architecture]](SOA) has assumed an essential part in making this a reality. BI pervades a whole association and, if utilized effectively, can decidedly impact choices that influence each useful territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Business-intelligence-Collaborative-decision-making|title=Business intelligence: Collaborative decision-making |accessdate=November 6, 2016 |work=Computer Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now collective Decision Making (CDM) is a joint government/industry activity went for enhancing air movement stream administration through expanded data trade among [[aeronautics]] group partners. CDM is included agents from government, general flight, carriers, private industry and the scholarly world who cooperate to make mechanical and procedural answers for the [[air traffic flow management]] (ATFM) challenges confronted by the [[National Airspace System|national airspace system]] (NAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/articles/airport-collaborative-decision-making-cdm |title=Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) |work=Eurocontrol |accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New techniques are being used to maximize understanding and improve collaborative Decision Making in areas such as design reviews, construction planning and integrated operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Washington, D.C.: Transportation Research Board. |first=|title=Framework for collaborative decision making on additions to highway capacity |year=2014 |url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's BI tools are doing good work in terms of extracting right information for the right people, but lack of accountability in decision making process is leading the organizations into poor choices. Though there is lot of money invested in the business Intelligence software and [[data warehouse]] technology, the output of these is still giving bad business choices. There is a gap created between level of information in business Intelligence and the quality and transparency of decision making.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/news/2240019648/Collaborative-decision-making-software-The-future-of-BI |title=Collaborative decision making software: The future of BI? |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem has become so prevalent that the need for collaborative decision making (CDM) software, a new approach making complex business decisions that closely links information and reports gathered from social media collaboration tools emerged. CDM platforms will give users easy access to relevant BI data sources as well as the ability to tag and search those sources for future reference and accountability. The decision itself would be linked to the BI software inputs, collaboration tools and the methods and practices that were used to make that decision.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The need of making complex and efficient decisions with the power of information systems made the use of business intelligence in collaborative decision making The quality of the decisions depends on the effective utilization of BI and information integration in the business which include – capturing BI value, effective practice of BI applications and knowledgeable business officials with expertise in BI and IT knowledge.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Benefits and potential==
The concept of social and collaborative BI has been hailed by many as the answer to the persistent problem that, despite increasing investment in BI, many organizations are failing to utilize reporting and analytics effectively and continue to make poor business decisions, resulting in low ROI.

[[Gartner]] predicts that CDM platforms will stimulate a new approach to complex [[decision making]] by linking the information and reports gleaned from BI software with the latest [[social media]] collaboration tools.&lt;ref name="Gartner"&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=164718, Gartner The Rise of Collaborative Decision Making], Gartner.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gartner's prognostic report, The Rise of Collaborative Decision Making, predicts that this new technology will minimize the cost and lag in the decision-making process, leading to improved productivity, operational efficiencies and ultimately, better, more timely decisions.&lt;ref name="Gartner"/&gt;

Recent [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] Global and [[Aberdeen Group]] research&lt;ref name="Aberdeen"&gt;[http://www.aberdeen.com/aberdeen-library/6451/ra-online-business-collaboration.aspx, Transforming Information Overflow to Improve Business Performance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929134416/http://www.aberdeen.com/aberdeen-library/6451/ra-online-business-collaboration.aspx%2C |date=2011-09-29 }}, Aberdeen.&lt;/ref&gt; have indicated that organizations with collaborative technologies respond to business threats and complete key projects faster, experiencing decreased time to market for new products as well as improved employee satisfaction.


==Components==
There are three major functions that combine together to enable effective enterprise collaboration and networking based on reporting and analytics, and form the basis of a CDM platform. These are the ability to:

# Discuss and overlay knowledge on business data
# Share knowledge and content
# Collectively decide the best course of action

===Discussing and overlaying knowledge on business data===
Most decision-making and discussion surrounding business processes occurs outside organizational BI platforms, opening a gap between human insight and the business data itself. Business decisions should be made alongside business data to ensure steadfast, fact-based decision-making.

An open-access discussion forum integrated into the BI solution allows users to discuss the results of data analysis, connecting the right people with the right data. Users are able to overlay human knowledge, insight and provide context to the data in reports.

A social layer within a BI solution improves the efficiency of business interaction regarding reporting and analytics compared to traditional avenues of communication such as faxes, phone calls and face-to-face meetings by:

# Being recordable: Conversations are automatically recorded, creating a searchable history of all interaction, eliminating unnecessarily revisiting points previously made
# Eliminating logistical hurdles: The need for complex and costly travel arrangements is significantly reduced, with geographically dispersed stakeholders able to participate in the exchange of information faster
# Enabling all relevant stakeholders to participate: All relevant stakeholders can contribute to discussion at their convenience

====Key features of a CDM forum====
Collaborative decision-making (CDM) is defined as social media feature which, if combined with BI applications, will allow an increased distribution and discussion of information through a number of key features. These key features include annotations, discussions, and tagging, embedding, and providing decisions.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://datameaning.com/download/?file=When_Social_Media_Meets_BI.pdf |title=When Social Media Meets BI The Impact of Incorporating Social Media within BI Solutions |last=|first=|date=2016 |website=|publisher=Data Meaning Services Group Inc. |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Annotations'' help others in accepting and interpreting the data, which makes it more significant. For instance, when users are creating or analyzing reports within the BI environment, they can add commentaries and annotations so as to offer context to the data. Business leaders can be observed to be assured that they completely understand the information on which decisions are grounded. ''Open-access discussions'' will allow the contributors to post their notions as well as to read, consider and enhance the proposals of others. This feature can be a valuable device for pursuing the input of other investors. This is because of how assimilating CDM tools within the BI environment offers the possibility to hold discussions in complete view of the significant data. ''Tagging'', on the other hand, enables the users to highlight related information in a flexible manner which makes it easy for other user to examine and recover beneficial and practical data. The ability to ''embed'' information enclosed in a BI solution into other applications is a vital factor for making sure that precise information is made accessible to decision-makers in a sensible manner. When information is embedded, it can be seen and commented on by several users. Meaning to say, ideas and suggestions can also be shared and discoursed in actual. Lastly, BI solutions are observed to have the capability of supporting appropriate decision-making that supports groups to attain explicit, quantifiable goals and objectives. These may also comprise an improved product overview or more lucrative supply chain.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===Sharing knowledge and content===
The digital era is often described as the Information Age. But the value of information resides in its ability to be shared.

A CDM module allows information relating to reporting and analytics to be shared in three ways, by:

# Cataloguing: A social layer within a BI solution allows users to create a searchable history by tagging and cataloging past discussions and reports within shared folders inside the BI portal. Tagging allows users to quickly and easily file report, annotation and discussion content under multiple categories for quick and easy retrieval.
# Distributing: The ability to export entire files/reports from the BI portal keeps all relevant decision-makers properly informed. Likewise, sharing direct links to external information in a threaded discussion within the CDM platform adds necessary detail, context and perspective to discussion.
# Embedding: A CDM layer within a BI tool enables users to embed reports and vital contextual content across platforms – wherever it is needed for decision-making.

====A CDM module does this in two ways====
# Within the BI tool's social layer or enterprise portals (intranet system) via a web services application programming interface (API)
# Outside the enterprise, on any platform, via YouTube style Java script export, enabling users to embed live interactive reports or other information by simply copying the Java script fragment into any HTML page

===Collectively deciding the best course of action===
Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) Systems are defined as cooperative computer-based systems which assist the elucidation of ill-structured difficulties by a set of decision makers who are functioning together as a team. Their main objective is to enlarge the effectiveness of decision clusters through the cooperative sharing of information among group members and the computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/hicss/1999/0001/01/00011019.pdf |title=Computer-Mediated Collaborative Decision Making: Theoretical and Implementation Issues. |last=Karacapilidis |first=N. |last2=Papadias |first2=D. |last3=Pappis |first3=C. |date=1999 |website=|publisher=|access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; CDM associates the social software with business intelligence in which this said amalgamation can radically improve the value of decision-making by directly connecting the information enclosed in BI systems with collaborative input garnered through the usage of social software. This has also been identified as collaborative BI which has become a collaborative decision-making (CDM) module. Accordingly, this attaches the purposes and philosophies of social networking and Web 2.0 technologies, putting them on to broadcasting and analytics. If this would be implemented properly, collaborative BI will have the capability to form important connections between people, data, process and technology which will then connect the gap concerning insight and action through assisting peoples’ normal decision-making procedures. In order for an organization to attain a real collaborative BI, they must requisite to implement a collaborative mentality as well and upkeep a culture of organization-wide data sharing and data entree. This halts down departmental silos, empowering quicker, improved and more operative decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.montage.co.nz/assets/Brochures/YellowfinCollaborativeBIWhitepaper.pdf |title=White Paper: Collaborative Business Intelligence |last=|first=|date=2012 |website=|publisher=|access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also observed as an inflexible precondition for success wherein if an organization has a culture where people are rewarded for hoarding evidence, or information, and being specialists without sharing, then that organization is not ready. Technology will be observed to not make an organization collaborative if it does not already upkeep the belief of teams from various business units functioning in concert on shared projects.

==Technology factors that underpin enterprise CDM==
A BI CDM module is underpinned by three factors.

1 Ease of use: CDM software follows the Web 2.0 [[self-service]] mindset. The collaborative components within the BI solution cater for a diversity of user ability and skill levels to ensure knowledge does not remain departmentalized.

2 Fully integrated: Users must be able to discuss their analysis alongside their BI content. Picture this scenario: You’re using your BI tool to search for data on last month's sales results from the Americas. You find a startling anomaly – sales have skyrocketed compared to previous months. Why? What has been done differently? How can you replicate the results? If the CDM platform is within the BI tool, you can immediately start the investigation, inviting others into the conversation in full view of the data. There's no need to set up meetings and discussions in isolation from your data set. The collaborative process remains clearly documented in a single open-access space, and discussion remains on topic – the underlying information (data) is right there. To enable successful CDM, both your collaborative platform and information should be in the one place.

3 Web-based: Being Web-based, the collaborative platform allows all relevant stakeholders to follow and contribute to discussion as it unfolds, regardless of location, time difference or device used to access it.

==Notable CDM modules in the Business Intelligence space==
Social BI and CDM software is still in its infancy according to Gartner, and remains underutilized.&lt;ref name="Gartner"/&gt; However, a handful of vendors in the BI marketplace offer CDM modules, including:
* [[IBM]] [[Cognos]] (Optional add on)
* [[Yellowfin Business Intelligence]]&lt;ref name="Yellowfin"&gt;[http://www.yellowfinbi.com/Document.i4?DocumentId=120950, White paper – Social and Collaborative Business Intelligence], Yellowfin Business Intelligence.&lt;/ref&gt; (Included Out of the box)

While the offerings listed above are larger BI systems with upgrades for CDM features, there have emerged some dedicated web based, software-as-a-service CDM offerings, including:
* [[1000minds]]&lt;ref name="orms"&gt;{{citation |author=Oleson, S. |title=Decision analysis software survey |url=http://www.orms-today.org/surveys/das/das.html |work=OR/MS Today |year=2016 |volume=43|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crisis intervention''' is an immediate and short-term [[psychology|psychological]] care aimed at assisting individuals in a crisis situation in order to restore equilibrium to their bio-psycho-social functioning and to minimize the potential of long-term [[psychological trauma]].&lt;ref name="Jackson-Cherry-Erford"&gt;Jackson-Cherry, L.R., &amp; Erford, B.T. (2010). Crisis intervention and prevention. NJ: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aguilera, D.C. (1998). ''Crisis Intervention. Theory and Methodology.'' Mosby, St Louis.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Crisis situations can be in the form of natural disasters, severe physical injury, sudden death of a loved one, and specific emotional crises as a result of drastic transitions such as divorce, children leaving home, pregnancy, family and school violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=People in crisis: Clinical and diversity perspectives|last=Hoff|first=L.|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The priority of crisis intervention and counseling is to hasten the process of and achieve stabilization. Crisis interventions must be applied at the spur of the moment and in a variety of settings, as trauma can arise instantaneously. 

== Crisis ==
[[File:Non-violent-crisis-prevention.JPG|thumb|An example of a crisis situation.&lt;!-- Need some explanation as to what is happening here that makes this a crisis situation. --&gt;]]
Crises can occur on a personal or [[societal]] level. Personal trauma is defined as an individual's experience of a situation or event in which he/she perceives to have exhausted his/her coping skill, [[self-esteem]], [[social support]], and power. These can be situations where a person is making suicidal threats, experiencing threat, witnessing homicide or suicide, or experiencing personal loss. While a person is experiencing a crisis on the individual level it is important for counselors to primarily assess safety. Counselors are encouraged to ask questions pertaining to social supports and networks, as well as give referrals for long term care.&lt;!-- need citation --&gt;

Societal or mass trauma can occur in a number of settings and typically affects a large group or society such as school shoot-outs, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters. A counselor's primary concern when called to these types of crises is to assess people's awareness of [[resources]]. Individuals experiencing trauma in a large scale need to be aware of shelters that offer food and water and places that meet their basic necessities for survival.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, J., Mittal, M., &amp; Wieling, E. (2008). Linking human systems: strengthening individuals, families, and communities in the wake of mass trauma. Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, 34(2), 193-209&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs of crisis ==

Counselors are encouraged to be aware of the typical responses of those who have experienced a crisis or are currently struggling with a trauma. On the cognitive level, they may blame themselves or others for the trauma. Often, the person appears disoriented, becomes hypersensitive or confused, has poor concentration, uncertain, and poor troubleshooting capabilities. Physical responses to trauma include increased heart rate, tremors, dizziness, weakness, chills, headaches, vomiting, shock, fainting, sweating, and fatigue. Among the common emotional responses of people who experience crisis in their lives include apathy, depression, [[irritability]], [[anxiety]], [[panic]], helplessness, hopelessness, [[anger]], [[fear]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], and denial. When assessing behavior, some typical responses to crisis are difficulty eating and/or sleeping, conflicts with others, withdrawal and lack of interest in social activities.&lt;ref name="Jackson-Cherry-Erford"/&gt;

== Universal principles ==

There are five basic principles outlined for intervention for individuals dealing with personal and societal crisis:

* Prompt intervention – Since victims are initially at high risk for maladaptive coping or immobilization. providing intervention as quickly as possible is imperative. Resource mobilization should be immediately enacted in order to provide victims with the tools they need to return to some sort of order and normalcy, in addition to enable independent functioning. 
* Facilitate comprehension – processing the situation or trauma is necessary in order for the sufferer to understand what the traumatic event was all about. This is done in order to help the victim gain a better understanding of what has occurred and allowing him or her to express feelings about the experience. 
* Problem-solving – The counselor should assist the victim(s) in resolving the issue within the context of their situation and feelings. This is necessary for developing [[self-efficacy]] and [[Individualism|self-reliance]]. 
* Return to normalcy – counselor must help the victim get back to being able to function independently by actively facilitating problem solving, assisting him/her in developing appropriate strategies for addressing those concerns, and in helping putting those strategies into action. This is done in hopes of enabling the victim to become [[self-reliant]].&lt;ref&gt;Flannery, R.B., &amp; Everly, G.S. (2000). Crisis intervention: a review. Internal Journal of Emergency Mental Health, 2(2), 119–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== General approach ==

A general approach of crisis intervention integrates numerous [[Psychological assessment|assessment]] tools and triage procedures. '''Roberts' 7-Stage Crisis Intervention Model''', '''SAFER-R Model''' and '''Lerner and Shelton's 10-step acute stress &amp; trauma management protocol''' creates one comprehensive model for responding to crisis that can be utilized in crisis situations.

The ACT ('''A'''ssessment '''C'''risis Intervention '''T'''rauma Treatment) model of crisis intervention developed by Roberts as a response to the September 11, 2001 tragedy outlines a three-stage framework.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;Roberts, A. (2006). Assessment, crisis intervention, and trauma treatment: the integrative act intervention model. Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention, 2(1), 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; 
This tool is a guide and not to be followed rigidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=AR|date=2005|title=Crisis Intervention Handbook: Assessment, Treatment, and Research|url=|journal=The British Journal of Social Work|volume=36|pages=157|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step is the assessment stage; this is done by determining the needs of victims, other involved persons, survivors, their families, and grieving family members of possible victim(s) and making appropriate referrals when needed.

'''These are the three types of assessments that need to be conducted:'''&lt;ref&gt;Everly &amp; Mitchell, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
# Triage assessment - an immediate assessment to determine lethality and determine appropriate referral to one of the following: emergency inpatient hospitalization, outpatient treatment facility or private therapist, or if no referral is needed;
# Crisis assessment - consists of gathering information regarding the individual's crisis state, environment, and interpersonal relationships to be used in working towards resolving the current crisis. This step helps facilitate development of an effective and appropriate treatment plan.
#Biosocial and [[cultural]] assessment - systematic assessment tools are used to ascertain the client's current levels of stress, situation, present problem, and severe crisis episode.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, J.A. (2002). Moving forward from September 11: a stress/crisis/trauma response model. Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention, 2, 55-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the crisis intervention stage of '''Roberts' ACT model''' is to resolve the client's present problems, [[Stress (biology)|stress]], [[psychological trauma]], and emotional conflicts. This is to be done with a minimum number of contacts, as crisis intervention is intended to be time-limited and goal-directed.

1. '''Intake and Assessing the person who is in Crisis/Suffering from the aftereffects of Crisis'''

Stage one of the seven step approach focuses on assessing lethality. The clinician is to plan and conduct a thorough biopsychosocial and lethality/imminent danger assessment; this should be done promptly at the time of arrival. Once lethality is determined one should establish rapport with the victim(s) whom the clinician will be working with.

2. '''Exploring the Crisis Situation of the person'''

The next phase is to identify major problem(s), including what in their life has led to the crisis at hand. During this stage it is important that the client is given the control and power to discuss their story in his or her own words.

3. '''Understanding the Coping Style employed by the person'''

While he or she is describing the situation, the intervention specialist should develop a conceptualization of the client's "modal coping style", which will most likely need adjusting as more information unfolds. This is referred to as stage three.

4. '''Confronting Feelings, Exploring Emotions and Challenging the Maladaptive Coping Style'''

As a transition is made to stage four, feelings will become prevalent at this time, so dealing with those feelings will be an important aspect of the intervention. While managing the feelings, the counselor must allow the client(s) to express his or her story, and explore feelings and emotions through active listening and validation. Eventually, the counselor will have to work carefully to respond to the client using challenging responses in order to help him or her work past maladaptive beliefs and thoughts, and to think about other options.

5. '''Exploring Solutions and Educating the client in best practices of Coping'''

At step five, the victim and counselor should begin to collaboratively generate and explore alternatives for coping. Although this situation will be unlike any other experience before, the counselor should assist the individual in looking at what has worked in the past for other situations; this is typically the most difficult to achieve in crisis counseling.

6. '''Developing a concrete treatment plan/structure of activities and Reassuring the clients newly gained healthy perspective'''

Once a list has been generated, a shift can be made to step six: development of a treatment plan that serves to empower the client. The goal at this stage it to make the treatment plan as concrete as possible which could be followed by the client and implemented as an attempt to make meaning out of the crisis event. Having meaning of the situation is also an important part of this stage because it allows for gaining mastery.

7. '''Follow-Up'''

Step seven is for the intervention specialist to arrange for follow-up contact with the client to evaluate his or her post crisis condition in order to make certain resolution towards progressing. The follow-up plan may include "booster" sessions to explore treatment gains and potential problems.&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt;

'''SAFER-R Model'''

The SAFER-R Model is a much used model of intervention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipa-usa.org/|title=International Police Association (IPA)|publisher=.ipa-usa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Roberts 7 Stage Crisis Intervention Model. The model approaches crisis intervention as an instrument to help the client to achieve his or her baseline level of functioning from the state of crisis. This intervention model for responding to individuals in crisis consists of 5+1 stages.

'''Lerner and Shelton's 10 step acute stress &amp; trauma management protocol'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaets.org/ten%20stages%20atsm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive view of how to treat the trauma consists of ten stages outlined by Lerner and Shelton (2001). These 10 steps relate similar to the crisis intervention steps. 
*The first step is to assess for danger/safety for self and others, this means for the victim, counselor, and others who may have been affected by the trauma. 
*Then consider the physical and perceptual mechanisms of injury. 
*Once injury is assessed the victim's level of responsiveness should be evaluated.
*If any medical needs are there, it should be addressed. 
*The individual who witnessed or is experiencing a crisis, should be observed to identify his or her signs of traumatic stress. 
*After the assessment of the situation is completed the counselor should introduce his or her self, state their title and role, and connect with the individual by building rapport. 
*A good rapport building allows for a more fluid approach in grounding the individual, this can be done by allowing the client/person to tell their story. 
*The interventionist provides support through active and empathetic listening, 
*Normalize, validate, and educate the individuals emotions, stress and adaptive coping styles.
*Finally, the intervention specialist is to bring the person to the present, describe future events, and provide referrals as needed.

After the crisis situation has been assessed and crisis interventions have been applied, the aim is at eliminating stress symptoms, thus treating the traumatic experience.

== Non-violent approach ==

Non-violent approach in crisis intervention for agitation management involves better understanding of Proxemics (Personal space of a person) and Kinesics (Nonverbal communication through postures).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crisisprevention.com/CPI/media/Media/Resources/webinar/eRefresher2012/eRefresher-2012-Part2/Key-Point-Refresher-SAMPLE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It helps to reduce anxiety, escalations and disruptions in agitated incidents and reduces use of restraints by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f_HYjDUArkMC&amp;pg=PA50 Restraint and Seclusion], Joint Commission Resources, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

When using crisis intervention methods for the disabled individual, every effort should first be made to first find other, preventative methods, such as giving adequate physical, occupational and speech therapy, and communication aides including sign language and Augmentative Communication systems, behavior and other plans, in order to first help the handicapped individual to be able to express their needs and function better.  Too often, crisis intervention methods including restraining holds are used without first giving the disabled more and better therapies or educational assistance.  Often school districts, for example, may use crisis prevention holds and "Interventions" against disabled children without first giving services and supports (at least 75% of cases of restraint and seclusion reported to the Department of Education involved disabled children in the 2011-12 school year.)  Also, school districts fail to inform parents about their disabled child's "intervention" with restraint or seclusion, thereby providing little, if any, opportunity for the family to help the disabled child recover.   Congress is trying to curtail the use of restraint and seclusion by school districts, having proposed legislation "Keeping All Students Safe Act" which had bi-partisan support but the bill has repeatedly died in committee.  It will be re-introduced in 2015 by Senator Chris Murphy (CT).  Critical incident [[debriefing]] is a widespread approach to counseling those in a state of crisis. This technique is done in a group setting 24–72&amp;nbsp;hours after the event occurred, and is typically a one-time meeting that lasts 3–4&amp;nbsp;hours, but can be done over numerous sessions if needed. [[Debriefing]] is a process by which facilitators describe various symptoms related [[PTSD]] and other [[anxiety]] disorders that individuals are likely to experience due to exposure to a trauma. As a group they process negative emotions surrounding the traumatic event. Each member is encouraged continued participation in treatment so that symptoms do not become exacerbated.&lt;ref&gt;Lilienfeld, S.O. (2007). Psychological treatments that cause harm. perspectives on psychological science, 2(1), 53-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical incident debriefing has been criticized by many for its effectiveness on reducing harm in crisis situations. Some studies show that those exposed to debriefing are actually more likely to show symptoms of [[PTSD]] at a 13-month follow-up than those who are not exposed to the debriefing. Most recipients of debriefing reported that they found the intervention helpful. Based on symptoms found in those who received no treatment at all, some critics state that reported improvement is considered a misattribution, and that the progress would naturally occur without any treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Regehr, C. (2001). Crisis debriefing groups for emergency responders: reviewing the evidence. Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention, 1, 87-100.

[[File:Customs-House-Brisbane-2.jpg|thumb|250px|The Customs House in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]]]

A '''custom house''' or '''customs house''' was a building housing the offices for the government officials who processed the paperwork associated with importing and exporting goods into and out of a country.  Customs officials also collected [[customs (tax)|customs duty]] on imported goods.

The custom house was typically located in a [[seaport]] or in a city on a major river, with access to the ocean.  These cities acted as a [[port of entry]] into a country.  The government stationed officials at such locations to collect taxes and regulate commerce.

Due to advances in electronic information systems, the increased volume of international trade, and the introduction of air travel, the term "custom house" is now often an historical anachronism.  There are many examples of buildings around the world that were formerly used as custom houses but have since been converted for other uses, such as museums or civic buildings.

In the [[United Kingdom]], since 1386, the phrase ''custom house'' has been in use over the term ''customs house''.  This was after a "[[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]]" was erected at Wool Wharf in [[Tower (ward)|Tower Ward]], to contain just the officials of the Great Custom on Wool and Woolfells.  The singular form was used even though in later years the Custom House was the location of other Customs officials as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Smith, Graham |date=1980|title=Something To Declare|page=6|publisher=Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd|location= London|isbn=0-245-53472-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''defibrator''' is a [[thermo mechanical pulp]]ing refiner in which the pulp material, such as [[wood chips]], is ground in an environment of [[steam]] between a rotating grinding disc (rotor) and a stationary disc (stator) each with radial grooves that provides the grinding surface. Wood chips are fed into the centre and are broken down as the centrifugal force pushes them towards the circumference of the discs where the grooves are finer to produce [[wood fibre]]. The size of the [[refine]]d fibres can to some extent be controlled by altering the distance between the discs where a closer distance produces finer fibres but also requires higher grinding force. The capacity per machine is largely determined by the size of the machine, as well as the motor speed 1500 rpm or 1800 rpm.

==History==
In 1931 the [[Sweden|Swedish]] engineer [[Arne Asplund]] filed a patent on a method to defibrate wood chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=2008892 |title=Method of manufacture of pulp| inventor=Arne Johan Arthur Asplund | gdate=1935-07-23 |status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to the [[Masonite]]-method, the defibrator-method (also known as the Asplund-method) uses pressurised steam to soften the wood chips, then grinding discs to pull the wood fibres apart. This grinding unit is what Asplund called the defibrator. It became the key product of his company, [[AB Defibrator]]. The Defibrator trademark is now held by [[Valmet]], the successor of AB Defibrator, for its line of refiners for the panelboard industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valmet.com/products/pulping-and-fiber/fiberboard/defibrator-system/ |title=Defibrator system |website=Valmet |access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Digital Invoice Customs Exchange (DICE)''' is a revenue protection idea developed to prevent tax evasion methods such as sales suppression in [[domestic trade]] and [[missing trader fraud]], [[transfer pricing]] in cross-[[border trade]]. As such, the implementation of this idea enables Revenue Authority to have advance notice of every commercial transaction.

Definition of the term "DICE" is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A technology-intensive tax compliance regimen for VAT/GST that utilizes invoice encryption to safeguard transactional data exchanged between seller and buyer in both domestic and import/export contexts while simultaneously notifying concerned jurisdictions of the transaction details.[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2314478]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==How it works==
A seller produces digital invoice containing minimum requirements as follows:
* Name of the seller with unique [[Taxpayer Identification Number]];
* Name of the purchaser with unique [[Taxpayer Identification Number]];
* Description of good/service;
* Unit price;
* Quantity;
* Tax rate;
* Total price with tax.

Such prepared invoice, along with proper authentication of the seller, is uploaded to the Revenue Authority server (seller's jurisdiction) using DICE protocol for safekeeping and signature processing. Based on the information provided by the seller, system will apply verifiable electronic signature and send it back in the same manner as it was received. Seller will include electronic signature received in return to finalize invoice before dispatching it to customer who may verify the content of the invoice at any time by checking the signature using Revenue Authority's or DICE's web portal.

In case customer is registered outside of the seller's jurisdiction, before signing the invoice Revenue Authority will provide notice to the other jurisdiction announcing the customer's identity and content of the invoice using DICE protocol. Given the fact that DICE is being used in another jurisdiction (meaning there is an agreement between two jurisdictions to use DICE protocol and exchange digital keys for the purpose of secure communication), the received information will be processed to acknowledge positively that customer is registered in accordance with the applicable Laws, thus the transaction is considered legal. If customer is not registered in the database of the receiving jurisdiction, invoice will not be completed with valid electronic signature.

==Benefits==
* DICE platform is based on [[open standard]];
* Secure communication between jurisdictions;
* Transparency in trade between legal entities;
* Disabling tax refund based on invalid documents;
* Verification of original invoice content available at any time;
* Taxpayer's [[audit trail]] is available at the Revenue Authority.

'''Downtown Guelph''' is the heart of the city of [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]]. It is bordered by Wellington St. E. to the south, Woolwich St. to the East, Dublin St. to the west and Norwich St. to the North. Downtown Guelph is known for its distinctive limestone architecture and heritage buildings. Many of Guelph's historically designated properties are in or near the downtown area.&lt;ref&gt;https://guelph.ca/city-hall/planning-and-development/community-plans-studies/heritage-conservation/designated-properties/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:John Galt bust.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of John Galt, downtown Guelph]]
[[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]], founder of Guelph, assisted by his surveyor, planned the community. He plotted a series of large public "squares" of varied shape; this unique street design provided one of the earliest examples of town planning in [[Ontario]]. Tradition relates that [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]], or one of his companions, laid his outstretched hand on a tree stump and predicted that the streets of the new town would radiate from a central point such as his fingers radiated from his palm. It is true that the main streets of downtown Guelph do follow such a pattern, but which came first, the legend or the plan, remains in doubt.

Several downtown streets are lined with [[Victorian Architecture|Victorian era]] buildings, which are now well over a century old.&lt;ref&gt;https://guelpharts.ca/historical-walking-tours-return-for-august&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Guelph's historically designated properties are in or near the downtown area.&lt;ref&gt;https://guelph.ca/city-hall/planning-and-development/community-plans-studies/heritage-conservation/designated-properties/&lt;/ref&gt; The old City Hall on Carden St., built between 1856 and 1857, is a National Historic Site of Canada; this structure is an example of mid-19th century Renaissance Revival architecture. This building, as well as the Annex, built in circa 1865, are historically designated by the government of Canada. Other historically designated buildings in the area include the Winter Fair Building&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=11892&lt;/ref&gt; and the Guelph Armoury.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=10090&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=4345&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=4345&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Quebec Street Mall]] was a street built in the mid 1800s that was enclosed and covered; that work was completed in 1984 and the street became an indoor shopping mall.&lt;ref&gt;https://oldquebecstreet.com/quebec-street-mall-guelph/quebec-street-mall-history-guelph/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==

Downtown Guelph is a relatively concentrated area compared to other downtowns which run in a straight line like a [[Main Street]]. Downtown is very easily accessible by car, regional and local transit, walking, and by bike. It is the home of Guelph's largest concentration of retail, dining, financial services, as well as entertainment, healthcare, and professional services like lawyers and doctors.
[[File:Basilica of Our Lady Immaculate, Guelph, 2015.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Basilica, built between 1875 and 1883]]
In recent years the area has been experiencing a renaissance as the Business Improvement Area (BIA) has brought in new retail, created Old Quebec Street, and improved the cleanliness. For entertainment there is the River Run Centre, a cinema at the Bookshelf Cafe, the [[Sleeman Centre (Guelph)|Sleeman Centre]] (home of the [[Guelph Storm]]), and a colourful array of amateur musical acts performing weekly at each of the smaller clubs/bars. Historical sites and landmarks include the [[Basilica of Our Lady Immaculate]], Guelph City Hall, The Armoury, Guelph train station, and Douglas Street.

===Planned redevelopment===
A redevelopment plan for the downtown area had been discussed by Council since 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4336055/guelph-baker-district-project/|title=Developer chosen for Guelph’s Baker District project|date=17 July 2018|publisher=Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc. Corus News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was finalized as the 2018 Baker District redevelopment project. The plan is to  transform the Baker St. parking lot and properties fronting Wyndham Street's north end into a mixed-use development, with urban intensification. Both residential and commercial buildings will be included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://guelph.ca/business/downtown-business/bakerdistrict/|title=Ottawa firm named Guelph's partner for Baker redevelopment|date=16 July 2018|publisher=Guelph Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final cost was estimated at between $315 million and $369 million. When finished, this area will include a new library, commercial, institutional and office space as well as an underground parking lot. The private enterprise partner for the project is Ottawa-based Windmill Development Group; there was also discussion about an additional partnership with [[Conestoga College]] and the Guelph [[YMCA]]. Actual construction was not expected to start until 2023. Before that date, up to $7.5 million will be spent to acquire the rest of the land that will be required. &lt;ref name="guelphtoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guelphtoday.com/local-news/city-chooses-green-developer-for-massive-baker-district-project-987290|title=City chooses green developer for massive Baker District project|date=16 July 2018|publisher=Guelph Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

Over the years many examples of fine architecture have contributed to the enrichment of the downtown area's unique appearance. Talented masons and builders made excellent use of the fine, warm-hued limestone which was so easily worked by stone carvers. The local limestone has contributed a splendid unity and visual distinction to the architecture of the community. Many fine examples of historic stone architecture remain intact and in a state of commendable preservation.

The post-World War II era saw many older buildings in St. Georges Square demolished and replaced by modern buildings. Other parts of downtown also had these modern pieces put in. Citizens rallied to start saving downtown Guelph's historic buildings and have protected many from being lost.

==Education==
Downtown Guelph used to be home to one high school, Bishop Macdonnell, which sat beside the [[Church of Our Lady Immaculate, Guelph|Church of Our Lady]]. There is currently one public school within the downtown core, Central Public School located on Dublin Street

==Guelph Public Library==
In 1882, the Ontario government passed the Free Libraries Act, allowing municipalities to establish libraries supported by local taxes. The City of Guelph was the first in Ontario to take advantage of this Act.  The Guelph Library attempted to seek suitable quarters and moved to its current location on the corner of Norfolk and Paisley. Guelph was one of the first communities to take advantage of grants made available by steel magnate [[Andrew Carnegie]].

Guelph is served by a growing library system composed of a main branch located in the downtown core, five branches and a [[Bookmobile]].  It holds a membership of over 85,000, the [http://www.guelphpl.ca/ Guelph Public Library] system's goals include preserving and indexing public materials relating to the history of Guelph.  Although no formal program has been developed, the library acquires municipal records of archival value from the City of Guelph.

The Guelph Public Library also offers a number of programs including a book club.

==Transportation==
[[File:Guelph train 2004 0701AC.jpg|thumb|Guelph Train Station]]
Downtown is home to [[Guelph Central Station]] which combines local bus service of [[Guelph Transit]] with [[Via Rail]], [[GO Transit]], and [[Greyhound Canada]] services. Downtown is also easily accessible by bike, with bike paths connecting residents from all sides of the city into the centre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9250">'''Earning to give''' involves deliberately pursuing a high-earning career for the purpose of donating a significant portion of earned income, typically because of a belief in [[effective altruism]].

Advocates of earning to give sometimes suggest that maximizing the amount one can donate to charity is an important consideration for individuals when deciding what career to pursue, even if the individual has less [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] interest in high-earning careers.&lt;ref name=kristof&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-the-trader-who-donates-half-his-pay.html?_r=0|title = The Trader Who Donates Half His Pay|last= Kristof|first = Nicholas|authorlink = Nicholas Kristof|date = April 4, 2015|accessdate = April 10, 2015|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents==
In the 1996 book ''[[Living High and Letting Die]]'', the philosopher [[Peter Unger]] wrote that it was morally praiseworthy and perhaps even morally required for people in academia who could earn substantially greater salaries in the business world to leave academia, earn the greater salaries, and donate most of the extra money to charity.&lt;ref name="Unger"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unger|first1=Peter|title=Living High and Letting Die|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198026811}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]] has laid the foundations for effective altruism and earning to give in his 1971 essay "[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality|''Famine, Affluence and Morality'']]" and since advocated for donating considerable amounts of one's income to effective charitable organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-singer-on-the-ethics-of-philanthropy-1428083293|title=Peter Singer on the Ethics of Philanthropy|last=Wolfe|first=Alexandra|date=2015-04-03|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-04-04|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer is a public proponent of effective altruism and endorsed earning to give in his 2013 [[TED talk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=The why and how of effective altruism|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism|language=en|accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associate Professor in Philosophy at Oxford University [[William MacAskill]] promoted earning to give as one possible high impact career in several news articles and in his 2015 book [[Doing Good Better|''Doing Good Better: Effective Altruism and a Radical New Way to Make a Difference'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/57254/to-save-the-world-dont-get-a-job-at-a-charity-go-work-on-wall-street/|title=To save the world, don’t get a job at a charity; go work on Wall Street|work=Quartz|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/09/10/working-for-a-hedge-fund-could-be-the-most-charitable-thing-you-do/|title=Working for a hedge fund could be the most charitable thing you do|last=MacAskill|first=William|date=2015-09-10|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=MacAskill|first2=William|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacAskill is the co-founder and president of [[80,000 Hours]], a nonprofit which conducts research on careers with positive social impact and provides career advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/about/meet-the-team/|title=Meet the team - 80,000 Hours|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization recommends earning to give as a career path with a high impact potential for effective altruists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/articles/earning-to-give/|title=Why and how to earn to give - 80,000 Hours|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/31/join-wall-street-save-the-world/|title=Join Wall Street.

==In practice==
Many of the people who practice earning to give consider themselves to be part of the effective altruism community.&lt;ref name=kristof/&gt;&lt;ref name=dailymail&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2334682/Young-professionals-joining-Wall-Street-save-world.html|title = The young professionals who believe their best chance at trying to save the world is by joining Wall Street and making millions|publisher = ''[[Daily Mail]]''|date = June 2, 2013|accessdate = April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacFarquhar|first1=Larissa|title=Strangers Drowning|date=2015|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=1594204330}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some donate up to 50% of their income, more than the 10% required for the basic [[Giving What We Can]] pledge.&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt; They may live frugally to donate more money.&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar" /&gt; Financial careers are popular for those pursuing earning to give.&lt;ref name="dailymail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt;

==Debate==
[[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] criticized the concept in his ''[[New York Times]]'' opinion column,&lt;ref name=brooks&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?ref=opinion|title = The Way to Produce a Person|last = Brooks|first = David|date = 2013-06-03|accessdate = 2013-10-16|publisher = ''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that, while altruists may start doing "earning to give" to realize their deepest commitments, their values may erode over time, becoming progressively less altruistic. In addition, Brooks objected to the view on which altruists should turn themselves "into a machine for the redistribution of wealth." [[Peter Singer]] responded to these criticisms in his book ''The Most Good You Can Do'' by giving examples of people who have been earning to give for years without losing their altruistic motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.yupnet.org/2016/08/09/earning-to-give-leads-to-happiness/|title='Earning to Give' Leads to Happiness|date=2016-08-09|website=Yale Press Log|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; William MacAskill also defended the practice against Brooks' criticisms in ''[[The Washington Post]],'' arguing that even [[Friedrich Engels]] was earning to give to support the work of anti-capitalist [[Karl Marx]] financially.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Dana Goldstein]] has also criticized earning to give, prompting a response from [[Reihan Salam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/349841/rise-singerians-reihan-salam|title = The Rise of the Singerians|last = Salam|first = Reihan|date = May 31, 2013|accessdate = November 26, 2013|publisher = ''[[National Review]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4220">[[File:Eduardo Madero.jpg|thumb|Eduardo Madero]]
'''Eduardo Madero''' (1823 — 1894) was an Argentine merchant, banker and developer.

==Life and times==
Eduardo Madero was born in [[Buenos Aires]], in 1823, to a family of farmers. A nephew of publisher [[Florencio Varela (writer)|Florencio Varela]], his uncle's enmity with the Governor of [[Buenos Aires Province]], [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], led Madero to relocate to [[Montevideo]], in neighboring [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref name=scarecrow&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Argentina''. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Madero established an [[International trade|import-export]] business and following Rosas' 1852 overthrow, he returned - by then a prosperous merchant. Madero was later elected to local office, as well as to the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]] as a supporter of the Buenos Aires-centric [[Partido Autonomista|Autonomist Party]]. He served as President of the [[Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires]] and, in 1874, the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcba.sba.com.ar/institucional/historia_presidentes.php Bolsa de Comercio de Buenos Aires {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Madero twice proposed the construction of a port facing the [[Plaza de Mayo]], in 1861 and 1869; but the proposals, the second of which obtained the Interior Ministry's endorsement, were ultimately passed over for a design by local engineer [[Luis Huergo]], whose plans called for a dock on the mouth of the [[Riachuelo River|Riachuelo]] (a river flowing along the city's industrial southside). Following the construction of the Port of [[La Boca]], in the 1870s, a sudden economic and population boom led the new President of Argentina, [[Julio Roca]], to commission the development in 1881 of a new, much larger port. The Director of Riachuelo Works, Luis Huergo, presented plans of his own design for a port of staggered docks, rather like the bittings on a key. The seasoned Madero, however, treveled to [[London]], where he obtained both the services of renowned British engineer Sir [[John Hawkshaw]] and financing for the project from [[Barings Bank]] (the chief underwriter of Argentine bonds and investment, at the time).&lt;ref name=historia&gt;[http://www.puertomaderocancun.com/History.htm Puerto Madero: history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923162459/http://www.puertomaderocancun.com/History.htm |date=2009-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan was presented to Congress in June 1882, where it received the endorsement of Senator [[Carlos Pellegrini]] (one of the Senate's most powerful figures). It was approved by both houses in October 1882, and Madero was entrusted not only with overseeing the completion of Sir John Hawkshaw's design of adjoining [[Maritime dock|impounded dock]]s; but also with negotiating the necessary financing of the project. The first dock was opened in 1889 and, as work continued northward, the second one was opened in 1890.&lt;ref name=pm&gt;[http://www.puertomadero.com/i_historia4.cfm Puerto Madero {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Panic of 1890]], however, led to the suspension of works, a setback remedied by a congressional appropriation in 1892. The resulting political controversy helped result in Madero's relocation to [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], where he died in 1894 at the age of 71.&lt;ref name=scarecrow/&gt;

The construction of the port outlived Madero, and the project was completed in 1897. Outstripped by rising shipping volume and freighter sizes even before its completion, in 1911 Madero's port was supplemented by [[Port of Buenos Aires|new facilities]] of Huergo's design. Madero's ''History of the Port of Buenos Aires'' was published posthumously by ''[[La Nación]]'', in 1902.&lt;ref name=scarecrow/&gt; The docklands he developed were renamed [[Puerto Madero]] in his honor and, beginning in the mid-1990s, were redeveloped as Buenos Aires' newest neighborhood.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt;

===2010 Haiti earthquake===

{{Main|2010 Haiti earthquake}}

The couple were about to enter the private, presidential living quarters in the National Palace when the earthquake struck.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Both were able to move away from the palace before the building collapsed.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; False rumors initially spread in Port-au-Prince that Delatour Preval had been killed in the quake.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

In the aftermath of the earthquake Delatour Preval told [[reporters]], "I'm convinced the country will make it. Seeing the solidarity among the people, there is hope."&lt;ref name=afp/&gt; Delatour Preval also defended the Haitian government of President Preval against [[criticism]] that it was ineffective, or even non-existent, in the days following the earthquake.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Marc|last=Lacey |title=U.S. Troops Patrol Haiti, Filling a Void |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/world/americas/20haiti.html|work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reiterated that the government was still functioning, while acknowledging that there was widespread concerns about government effectiveness, especially after the collapse of major government buildings, including the National Palace. In an [[interview]], Delatour Preval stated, "Visually, people can’t see what they used to recognize as the symbols of the state...That has generated some kind of panic. ‘Are they there or aren’t they there?’"&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5226">'''Fredrik Georg Gade''' (4 June 1830 – 16 May 1905) was a Norwegian businessperson and politician for the [[Liberal Party of Norway|Liberal Party]].

He was born in [[Bergen]] as the son of merchant Fredrik Georg Gade and his wife Anna. His ancestor had migrated to Norway from [[Hannover]] in the second half of the eighteenth century. In February 1854 he married Ingeborg Wallem (1830–1902), a sister of [[Fredrik Meltzer Wallem]].&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Gade, Fredrik Georg|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|editor=Bull, Edvard |editor-link=Edvard Bull, Sr. |editor2=[[Einar Jansen|Jansen, Einar]]|edition=1st|first=Andreas|last=Paulson|authorlink=Andreas Paulson|year=1929|volume=4|pages=334–335|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gade began working in his father's manufacture business ''F. G. Gade'' around the age of [[Confirmation]], and took over the company in 1849. As he did not acquire burghership until 1853, the company was run by his first cousin [[Herman Baars]] in the first phase. The company eventually went well, and in 1877 Gade retired from business, buying the farm Øvre Fantoft in [[Fana]]. He developed the surrounding area, and even bought a [[stave church]] which stood at Fortun in [[Sogn og Fjordane]], had it moved and re-erected it as [[Fantoft stave church]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; This church burned down in 1993 under gloomy circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Campion|title=In the face of death|date=20 May 2005| publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]]|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1419364,00.html|work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gade also took much of the initiative to found the [[Nesttun–Os Railway]], and was an important shareholder.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

From 1880 to 1896 Gade was the [[United States|American]] [[consul (representative)|consul]] for all of [[Western Norway]], including the coast up to [[Vardø]] in the north.

He wanted to back out of national politics, and only served as a deputy representative during the term 1886–1888.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Gade also founded two insurance companies, [[Vesta (company)|Vesta]] in 1880 and [[Hygea (company)|Hygea]] in 1884 (often branded as the same company, "Vesta-Hygea"),&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Livsforsikringsselskapet Hygea|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|first=|last=|volume=|editor=|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.storenorskeleksikon.no/Livsforsikringsselskapet_Hygea|language=Norwegian|accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a board member of both companies until his death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5637">'''Gershon Mesika''' ({{Lang-he|גרשון מסיקה}}, born 5 July 1952) an [[Israel]]i lawyer and politician. He has served as head of the [[Shomron Regional Council]], but has been detained as a result of his role in a "massive corruption scandal", and subsequently replaced by acting head [[Yossi Dagan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4610866,00.html "Itamar Eichner 'US embassy: Diplomats did not pull guns on settlers' (3 Jan 2015) Ynet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Ashdod]] in Israel, Mesika is an Israeli lawyer. Since 1982, he has lived in the [[Israeli settlement]] of [[Elon Moreh]] with his wife and family. He previously owned a local armored limousine service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shomron.org.il/Index.asp?ArticleID=3454&amp;CategoryID=53&amp;Page=1 Council Head Gershon Mesika - Personal Profile] Shomron Regional Council&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, he was elected director of Shomron Regional local government. Immediately after being elected as head of the Shomron Regional Council, Mesika took on the issue of restoring [[Joseph's Tomb]] in the city of [[Nablus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3644068,00.html Hundreds of settlers enter Joseph's Tomb] Ynetnews, 25 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Under Mesika direction ongoing efforts have been since the end of 2007 to renovate the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/129032 Joseph’s Tomb Gets a Paint Job After 9 Years of Arab Desecration] Israel National News, 25 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
As a leader of the Israeli settlers in the [[West Bank]], Mesika called on his constituents to vote right in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 Knesset elections]]. In a letter to his constituents, Mesika wrote "It doesn't matter which nationalist camp party you vote for, the main thing is to vote!". He also called upon the residents to "get involved and help out the nationalist parties, each person according to his or her preference. The main thing is to volunteer and act in order to strengthen the nationalist camp".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/129755 Yesha Leaders: Make Sure to Vote Nationalist] Israel National News, 3 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He has called on Jewish families living in West Bank settlements to have more children to continue the exponential growth in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/168577 Katz, Mesika Praise Yesha Population Growth] Israel National News, 27 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As an advocate for growth in the Jewish communities in the Shomron, Mesika symbolic tore up building freeze orders issued by Israeli defense minister [[Ehud Barak]]. He termed the restrictions aimed at Jewish population only as racist decree and called on the Israel government to support the growth and development of these communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/world/middleeast/30mideast.html The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ZbbA_G1FIuE|No to building freeze - Shomron Council head Gershon Mesika}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he appointed strategic advisor and local activist [[David Ha'ivri]] to head the [[Shomron Liaison Office]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://yeshuv.org The Shomron Liaison Office website]&lt;/ref&gt; as part of an overall effort to improve the public image of the Jewish settlements in the region. Tours for elected officials and journalists&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/137030 TV Celeb Visits Jews in Samaria]&lt;/ref&gt; are part of this ongoing public relations effort.

In 2013, police began investigating a company, The Central Company for the Development of Samaria, which is involved in developing West Bank settlements, and where Mesika was chairman of the board. The police acted on suspicions of bribery, embezzlement and tax fraud of over NIS 10 million over the previous 5-year period. The company is co-owned by the Shomron Regional Council, which governs many settlements in the West Bank, and by settlement association coops. The firm is involved in construction and also runs a line of bullet-proof buses.&lt;ref&gt;"Haim Levinson 'Police suspect West Bank settlement developer of bribery, tax fraud' (20 Nov 2013) Haaretz" http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.559055&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2014, Mesika was initially arrested, then eight days later released to house arrest in his home in Elon Moreh, as part of a wide-ranging police investigation into corruption. As part of the arrangement, he is forbidden to leave Israel for a 90-day period. He is prohibited from entering the Shomron Regional Council for 30 days, and from entering the Company for Development of Samaria for 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;"Gil Ronen 'Samaria Leader Mesika Released to House Arrest' (1 Jan 2015) Arutz Sheva"

On 22 November 2015 he drove his car into a 16 year old Palestinian girl near the [[Huwwara checkpoint|Hawara]] army checkpoint. She  was reported to have been about to attack a settler with a knife. A soldier and a civilian then shot the girl dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Haaretz]] 22 November 2014 11:23 Giil Cohen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the [[Ma'an News Agency]] it was Mesika who shot the teenager.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">'''ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000''' is the [[Assurance services|standard for assurance]] over non-financial information. ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 is issued by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). The standard consists of guidelines for the ethical behavior, quality management and performance of an ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 engagement.

Generally ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 is applied for [[audit]]s of internal control, sustainability and compliance with laws and regulations. [[ISAE 3402]] assurance engagements also should be performed in accordance with the ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 standard.

ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 recognizes two types of reports, a type 1 and a type 2 report. A type 1 report provides assurance on the suitability of design and existence of controls and type 2 report provides assurance on suitability of design, existence and operational effectiveness.

==ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 audit==
In the ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 standard no detailed guidelines are included for the performance of the engagement. This implies that the auditor use professional judgement for the scope, amount of controls tested and testing methods.

==Content report==
An ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 report generally consists of a description of the scope, the norm against which the report is tested, a description of the control framework and a detailed description of the risk management system and a control matrix consisting of the risks, the related control objectives and the related controls.

'''Ion Muşuc''' (born 31 May 1951) is a [[Moldova]]n politician.

== Biography ==

Ion Muşuc was born on 31 May 1951, in [[Bilicenii Noi]], [[Sîngerei District]]. He is the former leader of the [[Social Democratic Party of Moldova]].

In September 2006, Ion Muşuc and his son, Eduard, were accused of fraudulently churning collateral to the tune of 2 million [[Moldovan lei]] ($155,836). At that time, the elder Muşuc was the head of the opposition [[Social Democratic Party of Moldova|Social Democratic Party]] and Eduard Muşuc was a member of its leadership and the former director of the successful Internet provider Megadat. Ion Muşuc fled Moldova when the case was made public, while his son was arrested on charges punishable by 10 to 25 years in prison. Bail was set and rescinded several times until in April 2007, the court dismissed the accusation for lack of a substantive basis. Muşuc took his case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]], and in November 2007 was awarded 12,000 euros ($17,590) for moral suffering and legal fees in connection with what the court termed his "illegal detention."&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicom.moldova.org/news/moldova-must-stop-mixing-politics-and-prosecutions-200929-eng.html Moldova Must Stop Mixing Politics And Prosecutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, his party has no seats in the [[Parliament of the Republic of Moldova]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7725">'''Kleercut''' is the name of a former campaign conducted by [[Greenpeace]], the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], and others towards [[Kimberly-Clark]]. It lasted from 2004 to 2009.  Kimberly-Clark is the [[Earth|world]]’s largest manufacturer of tissue products, most notably the [[Kleenex]] brand. According to its annual environmental report, the company purchases over 3.1 million metric tonnes (3.4 million tons) of virgin fiber from logging companies annually. The Kleercut campaign claims that this fiber is derived from [[wood pulp]] from [[old growth forest]]s. Kimberly-Clark claims that the forests in question are largely cut for timber. The Kleercut campaign claims that Kimberly-Clark support the [[clearcutting]] of such forests in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], including forests habitat for [[wolverine]] and [[Endangered species|threatened wildlife]] the [[caribou|woodland caribou]]. Kimberly-Clark has responded that many of its supplies are certified by the [[Sustainable Forestry Initiative]] or the Canadian Standards Association.

== Detailed campaign goals ==

The campaign is asking Kimberly-Clark to:

* Stop using [[wood fiber]] from endangered forests such as the [[Boreal forest]]. 
* Stop producing tissue products using only [[virgin wood fibers]] and instead increase the use of [[post-consumer recycled fiber]] in all of its products. 
* Utilize [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) eco-certified forestry operations for what virgin wood fibers it does use.

==Outcome==

The result: On August 5, 2009, Kimberly-Clark and [[Greenpeace]] held a joint press conference, where the company announced that it would source 40% of its paper fiber from recycled content or other sustainable sources – a 71% increase from 2007 levels. The demand created by Kimberly-Clark for sustainably logged fiber was greater than the supply, enabling the company to convince logging companies to change their practices.&lt;ref name=" Greenpeace and Kimberly-Clark Settle Feud"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[New York Times]] |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/greenpeace-and-kimberly-clark-settle-feud/?_r=0 |title=Greenpeace and Kimberly-Clark Settle Feud|accessdate=2013-08-23 |first=Leslie |last=Kaufman |date=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1718476/exclusive-how-kimberly-clark-ditched-its-forest-destroying-reputation-and-embraced-greenpeac|title= Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kleercut website read as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
5 August 2009: Kimberly-Clark releases new environmental policy.

The Kleercut campaign is over.

Canada's precious Boreal Forest is better conserved today. So are ancient forests around the world.

At a joint news conference in Washington DC, Greenpeace and the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, the world’s largest tissue-product manufacturer, announced an historic agreement that will ensure greater protection and sustainable management of Canada's Boreal Forest and other ancient forests around the world. 

The agreement also will stand out as a model for forest-products companies worldwide.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Grassroots efforts in the Kleercut Campaign ==

The Kleercut campaign was centered around a philosophy that an effective and engaged grassroots is needed for a successful campaign. The majority of grassroots activity pressuring aimed at Kimberly Clark occurred in Canada and the United States.

According to Greenpeace the Kleercut campaign is "one of the more successful online forest campaigns in recent Canadian history," gaining Greenpeace Canada "1,000 new [email] sign-ups each month."&lt;ref&gt;http://kleercut.net/en/open-source-campaigning&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phil Radford]] of [[Greenpeace]] US oversaw the grassroots mobilization efforts on the campaign in the U.S. The campaign included sneaking into Kleenex commercial shoots,&lt;ref name="Kleenex Gets Punk’d"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZCym0DB7hA |title=Kleenex Gets Punk’d|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; convincing twenty-two universities and colleges to take action such as cancelling contracts,&lt;ref name=" Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" About the Student Network"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/getinvolved/get-involved/student-network/a-brief-history-of-the-greenpe/|title= 2005-2009 - Kleercut-Free Campuses and Victory!|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; recruiting 500 companies to boycott Kimberly Clark,&lt;ref name="Forest Friendly 500"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url=http://forestfriendly500.org |title= Forest Friendly 500 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 1,000 protests of the company, mobilizing volunteers to put flyers in Kleenex boxes,&lt;ref name=" More Than Tissues in a Box of Kleenex"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2008-02-16/business/36867371_1_kleenex-kimberly-clark-greenpeace-office | title= More Than Tissues in a Box of Kleenex|accessdate=2013-08-23 |first=Ylan Q. |last=Mui |date=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more.&lt;ref name=" Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace"/&gt;

==Forest Certification==
One of the main demands to Kimberly-Clark and other large customers of Canadian logging companies operating in ancient forests is to turn to the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), a performance based [[certified wood|forest certification]] program supported by local communities, environmental organizations, aboriginal groups, and industry. Kimberly-Clark currently sources the majority of its pulp (near 3 million tons) from Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) certified logging operations.

[[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) certification has been criticized as well. While the most common criticism is that FSC is overly political, for example in Australia's forest  Minister Abetz said "a limiting feature of the FSC is the involvement of environmental organisations, particularly WWF and Greenpeace. WWF and Greenpeace formed the FSC in 1994 as a vehicle to further their political objectives and to take control of forest management and its regulation away from Governments." [http://www.nafi.com.au/media/view.php3?id=442]. It has also been pointed out that: "The largest certified clearcut in the world is on an FSC certified forest in Ontario." [http://www.healthybuilding.net/news/060427sfi-fsc.html] One organization critical of FSC is  Greenwood Earth Alliance who point that FSC certified forest  "cover large industrial-scale operations involving massive clearcutting and even-aged management" and that at least one FSC certified company operating in Canada "engage in clearcutting, high-grading, even-aged management, [[overlogging]], and very large scale destruction of habitat through industrial logging." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsc-watch.org/archives/2006/11/08/A_Critique_of_the_Tembec_Certifications__FSC_s_largest_certified_company&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lawrence Valenstein''' (1899-1982) was an American advertising executive who founded the [[Grey Global Group|Grey Advertising Agency]].&lt;ref name=NYTValensteinObit&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/12/nyregion/lawrence-valenstein-dies-at-83-founder-of-grey-advertising.html New York Times: "LAWRENCE VALENSTEIN DIES AT 83; FOUNDER OF GREY ADVERTISING" by Suzanne Daley] September 12, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AdAge&gt;[http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/grey-advertising-agency-grey-advertising-grey-worldwide/98498/ Advertising Age: "Grey Advertising Agency (Grey Advertising; Grey Worldwide)"] September 15, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Valenstein was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/advertising Jewish Virtual Library: "Modern Jewish History: Advertising"] retrieved July 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last= Handley |first=Lucy  |authorlink=   |title=This ad agency is standing against ‘the rising tide of xenophobia’ and rebranding with the name of its Jewish founders   |publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=28 March 2017 |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/28/this-ad-agency-is-rebranding-with-the-name-of-its-jewish-founders.html  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1899.&lt;ref name=NYTValensteinObit /&gt; On August 1, 1917, at the age of 18, Valenstein borrowed $100 and started his own company located at 309 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=NYTValensteinObit /&gt; He named the company the Grey Agency because the walls of the office were grey.&lt;ref name=NYTValensteinObit /&gt; The company's original focus was to publish direct mailings for the furrier industry which morphed into a magazine named ''Furs and Fashions''.&lt;ref name=NYTValensteinObit /&gt; In 1925, the firm, renamed the Grey Advertising Agency, became a full-fledged advertising agency&lt;ref name=NYTValensteinObit /&gt; and differentiated itself from its competitors by using a team approach to advertising that closely worked with its customers and conducted extensive marketing research.&lt;ref name=AdAge /&gt; Valenstein focused on developing a brand through pre-selling and building a market for it.&lt;ref name=NYTValensteinObit /&gt; In the 1930s the firm focused on soft goods.&lt;ref name=NYTValensteinObit /&gt; In the 1940s, the firm was billing $1 million per year.&lt;ref name=NYTValensteinObit /&gt; In 1947, after winning [[Gruen watch]] account, billings reached $10 million.&lt;ref name=AdAge /&gt; In 1955, after winning the [[Block Drug]] account, Grey's billings reached $30 million.&lt;ref name=AdAge /&gt; In 1956, Valenstein became chairman of the board and [[Arthur C. Fatt]] (hired in 1921 at the age of seventeen) became president.&lt;ref name=AdAge /&gt; In 1957, Grey developed the widely successful "Leaving now for Trenton, Philadelphia and Cucamonga!" campaign for [[Greyhound Bus]] with the tagline "Go Greyhound and leave the driving to us."&lt;ref name=AdAge /&gt;

In 1961, billings reached $59 million&lt;ref name=AdAge /&gt; and Valenstein became chairman of the executive committee;&lt;ref name=NYTValensteinObit /&gt; Fatt was named chairman and [[Herbert D. Strauss]] its president.&lt;ref name=AdAge /&gt; In 1961, the firm expanded by opening an office in Los Angeles;&lt;ref name=AdAge /&gt; and he expanded internationally by opening offices in London in 1962 and Japan in 1963.&lt;ref name=AdAge /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTValensteinObit /&gt; In 1964, billings reached $100 million.&lt;ref name=AdAge /&gt; In 1965, the firm went public trading on the [[Nasdaq]] exchange and the firm also expanded into the use of [[psychographics]] (the analysis of consumer lifestyles).&lt;ref name=AdAge /&gt; In 1965, Valenstein retired and was named founder/chairman.&lt;ref name=NYTValensteinObit /&gt;

Valenstein and fellow Jews, [[Albert D. Lasker]] and [[Milton H. Biow]], are widely credited with opening the advertising industry to a new generation of [[Jewish]] advertising professionals including: [[Arthur C. Fatt]], [[Herbert D. Strauss]], [[William Bernbach]], [[Norman B. Norman]], [[Maxwell Dane]], [[Julian Koenig]], [[Frederic S. Papert]], [[Maxwell B. Sackheim]]; [[David R. Altman]], [[Ernest Dichter]], Stanley Arnold, and [[Monroe Green]].&lt;ref name=JVL /&gt;

== Digital cameras ==

Kodak has produced a wide variety of [[digital camera]]s for both professional and consumer use.

=== Kodak professional digital cameras ===

Kodak was a leader in professional-grade digital photography products, although in recent years it has retreated from this market. Since Kodak did not have its own line of lenses, Kodak [[digital SLR]]s have all taken either [[Canon EOS]] or [[Nikon F-mount]] lenses; most have either been based on [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] or [[Nikon Corporation|Nikon]] 135 film [[single lens reflex|SLRs]]. PixPro has seen its kind of revival, but manufactured by JK Imaging instead of Kodak.

==== Kodak EasyShare consumer digital cameras ====
[[Kodak EasyShare|EasyShare]] was Kodak's line of consumer digital cameras compatible with "docks" also manufactured by Kodak, simplifying the process of interfacing with computers for editing and printing.

===== Kodak EasyShare DX series =====
The DX series cameras were the first EasyShare models released, beginning with the DX3215. It was originally a very basic point and shoot camera series, compatible with the original EasyShare Camera Dock. The CX series eventually replaced the lower-end DX models, and the newer DX-Series models had more advanced features and higher megapixel resolutions and zoom. The DX series is now discontinued. The higher-end of the DX-Series (higher zoom, megapixel) eventually became the Z-Series. Select DX models were the last Kodak consumer digital cameras to use CompactFlash external memory cards.

If the zygote has not implanted by day 10, implantation becomes increasingly unlikely in subsequent days.&lt;ref name="pmid10362823"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Wilcox AJ, Baird DD, Weinberg CR | title=Time of implantation of the conceptus and loss of pregnancy | journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume=340 | issue=23 | pages=1796–1799 | year=1999 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199906103402304 | pmid=10362823 | deadurl=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A chemical pregnancy is a pregnancy that was detected by testing but ends in miscarriage before or around the time of the next expected period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Condous|first1=edited by Tom Bourne, George|title=Handbook of early pregnancy care|date=2006|publisher=Informa Healthcare|location=London|isbn=9780203016213|pages=28–29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Y3PyNvc6dcC&amp;pg=PA29|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910181311/https://books.google.com/books?id=_Y3PyNvc6dcC&amp;pg=PA29|archivedate=September 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than half of embryos miscarried in the first 13 weeks. Half of embryonic miscarriages (25% of all miscarriages) have an [[aneuploidy]] (abnormal number of chromosomes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1980|title=Anatomic and chromosomal anomalies in 639 spontaneous abortuses|journal=Human Genetics|volume=55|issue=1|pages=87–98|doi=10.1007/BF00329132|pmid=7450760|vauthors=Kajii T, Ferrier A, Niikawa N, Takahara H, Ohama K, Avirachan S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common chromosome abnormalities found in miscarriages include [[Trisomy|autosomal trisomy]] (22-32%), [[Turner syndrome|monosomy X]] (5-20%), [[Polyploid|triploidy]] (6-8%), [[tetraploidy]] (2-4%), or other structural chromosomal abnormalities (2%).&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt; Genetic problems are more likely to occur with older parents; this may account for the higher rates observed in older women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pregnancy Over Age 30 | website=MUSC Children's Hospital | url = http://www.musckids.com/health_library/hrpregnant/over30.htm | accessdate = December 18, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061113233603/http://www.musckids.com/health_library/hrpregnant/over30.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = November 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second and third trimesters===
Second trimester losses may be due to maternal factors such as [[uterine malformation]], growths in the uterus ([[Uterine fibroid|fibroid]]s), or [[Cervical incompetence|cervical problems]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; These conditions also may contribute to [[premature birth]].&lt;ref name="webmd" /&gt; Unlike first-trimester miscarriages, second-trimester miscarriages are less likely to be caused by a genetic abnormality; chromosomal aberrations are found in a third of cases.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt; Infection during the third trimester can cause a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== Age ===
{{Further|Advanced maternal age}}
The age of the pregnant woman is a significant risk factor.  Miscarriage rates increase steadily with age, with more substantial increases after age 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bray I, Gunnell D, [[George Davey Smith|Davey Smith G]]|year=2006|title=Advanced paternal age: How old is too old?|journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health|volume=60|issue=10|pages=851–3|doi=10.1136/jech.2005.045179|pmc=2566050|pmid=16973530}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In those under the age of 35 the risk is about 10% while it is about 45% in those over the age of 40.&lt;ref name="John2012" /&gt; Risk begins to increase around the age of 30.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Epi" /&gt; Paternal age is associated with increased risk.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=175}}

===Obesity, eating disorders and caffeine===
Not only is obesity associated with miscarriage, it can result in sub-fertility and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recurrent miscarriage is also related to obesity. Women with [[bulimia nervosa]] and [[anorexia nervosa]] may have a greater risk for miscarriage. Nutrient deficiencies have not been found to impact miscarriage rates but [[hyperemesis gravidarum]] sometimes precedes a miscarriage.
{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}}

[[Caffeine]] consumption also has been correlated to miscarriage rates, at least at higher levels of intake.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, such higher rates have been found to be statistically significant only in certain circumstances.

Vitamin supplementation has generally not shown to be effective in preventing miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue = 5|pages = CD004073|last=Balogun|first=Olukunmi O|last2=da Silva Lopes|first2=Katharina|last3=Ota|first3=Erika|last4=Takemoto|first4=Yo|last5=Rumbold|first5=Alice|last6=Takegata|first6=Mizuki|last7=Mori|first7=Rintaro|date=2016-05-06|isbn = |language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd004073.pub4|pmid = 27150280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese traditional medicine has not been found to prevent miscarriage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Endocrine disorders===
Disorders of the thyroid may affect pregnancy outcomes. Related to this, iodine deficiency is strongly associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}} The risk of miscarriage is increased in those with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}} Women with well-controlled diabetes have the same risk of miscarriage as those without diabetes.&lt;ref name=Ferri2017&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred F.

===Food poisoning===
Ingesting food that has been contaminated with [[listeriosis]], [[toxoplasmosis]], and [[salmonella]] is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = gloss/&gt;

===Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling===
Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are procedures conducted to assess the fetus. A sample of amniotic fluid is obtained by the insertion of a needle through the abdomen and into the uterus. Chorionic villus sampling is a similar procedure with a sample of tissue removed rather than fluid. These procedures are not associated with pregnancy loss during the second trimester but they are associated with miscarriages and birth defects in the first trimester.&lt;ref name="Alfirevic"/&gt; Miscarriage caused by invasive prenatal diagnosis ([[chorionic villus sampling]] (CVS) and [[amniocentesis]]) is rare (about 1%).&lt;ref name="Agarwal-Alfirevic-2012"/&gt;

===Surgery===
The effects of surgery on pregnancy are not well-known including the effects of [[bariatric]] surgery. Abdominal and pelvic surgery are not risk factors in miscarriage. Ovarian tumors and cysts that are removed have not been found to increase the risk of miscarriage. The exception to this is the removal of the corpus luteum from the ovary. This can cause fluctuations in the hormones necessary to maintain the pregnancy.{{sfn|Hoffman|pages=172–173}}

===Medications===
Immunizations have not been found to cause miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=72}} There is no significant association between [[antidepressant]] medication exposure and spontaneous abortion.&lt;ref name="Ross LE 436–443"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross LE|last2=Grigoriadis S|last3=Mamisashvili L|display-authors=etal|date=2013-04-01|title=Selected pregnancy and delivery outcomes after exposure to antidepressant medication: A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|volume=70|issue=4|pages=436–443|doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.684|pmid=23446732|issn=2168-622X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of miscarriage is not likely decreased by discontinuing [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] prior to pregnancy.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalke|first=Katharine Baratz|last2=Wenzel|first2=Amy|last3=Kim|first3=Deborah R.|date=2016-04-19|title=Depression and Anxiety During Pregnancy: Evaluating the Literature in Support of Clinical Risk-Benefit Decision-Making|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|language=en|volume=18|issue=6|pages=1–12|doi=10.1007/s11920-016-0698-x|pmid=27091646|issn=1523-3812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some available data suggest that there is a small increased risk of miscarriage for women taking any [[antidepressant]],&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=Gestational exposure to antidepressants and the risk of spontaneous abortion: A review|journal=Current Drug Delivery|volume=7|issue=1|pages=76–92|doi=10.2174/156720110790396508|pmid=19863482|vauthors=Broy P, Bérard A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=Use of antidepressants during pregnancy and the risk of spontaneous abortion|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=182|issue=10|pages=1031–7|doi=10.1503/cmaj.091208|pmc=2900326|pmid=20513781|vauthors=Nakhai-Pour HR, Broy P, Bérard A}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this risk becomes less [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] when excluding studies of poor quality.&lt;ref name="Ross LE 436–443"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yonkers|first=Kimberly A.|last2=Blackwell|first2=Katherine A.|last3=Glover|first3=Janis|last4=Forray|first4=Ariadna|date=2014-01-01|title=Antidepressant Use in Pregnant and Postpartum Women|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=10|issue=1|pages=369–392|doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032813-153626|pmc=4138492|pmid=24313569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicines that increase the risk of miscarriage include:

* retinoids&amp;nbsp;
* nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&amp;nbsp;, such as ibuprofen
* misoprostol&amp;nbsp;
* methotrexate&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Chemotherapy and radiation treatments for cancer===
Ionizing radiation levels given to a woman during cancer treatment cause miscarriage. Exposure can also impact fertility. The use of chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat childhood cancer increases the risk of miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}}

===Intercurrent diseases===
Several [[intercurrent diseases in pregnancy]] can potentially increase the risk of miscarriage, including diabetes, [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS), hypothyroidism, certain infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases. PCOS may increase the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Two studies suggested treatment with the drug [[metformin]] significantly lowers the rate of miscarriage in women with PCOS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jakubowicz DJ, Iuorno MJ, Jakubowicz S, Roberts KA, Nestler JE | title = Effects of Metformin on Early Pregnancy Loss in the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome | journal = Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 524–9 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11836280 | doi = 10.1210/jc.87.2.524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khattab S, Mohsen IA, Foutouh IA, Ramadan A, Moaz M, Al-Inany H | title = Metformin reduces abortion in pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome | journal = Gynecological Endocrinology | volume = 22 | issue = 12 | pages = 680–4 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17162710 | doi = 10.1080/09513590601010508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the quality of these studies has been questioned.&lt;ref name="RCOG-PCOS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|title=Long-term consequences of polycystic ovarian syndrome|url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/GT33_LongTermPCOS.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20100710113119/http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/GT33_LongTermPCOS.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-07-10|website=Green-top Guideline No. 27|publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|accessdate=2 July 2013|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metformin treatment in pregnancy has not been shown to be safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lilja AE, Mathiesen ER | title = Polycystic ovary syndrome and metformin in pregnancy | journal = Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica | volume = 85 | issue = 7 | pages = 861–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16817087 | doi = 10.1080/00016340600780441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists also recommended against use of the drug to prevent miscarriage.&lt;ref name="RCOG-PCOS" /&gt; Thrombophilias or defects in coagulation and bleeding were once thought to be a risk in miscarriage but have been subsequently questioned.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=174}}
Severe cases of [[hypothyroidism]] increase the risk of miscarriage. The effect of milder cases of hypothyroidism on miscarriage rates has not been established. A condition called luteal phase defect (LPD) is a failure of the uterine lining to be fully prepared for pregnancy. This can keep a fertilized egg from implanting or result in miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/you-get-pregnant/trying-conceive/#4|title=Trying to conceive {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' infection is associated with increased risk of [[preterm birth]] and miscarriage.&lt;ref name="LisRowhani-Rahbar2015"/&gt;

Infections can increase the risk of a miscarriage: rubella&amp;nbsp;(German measles), cytomegalovirus, bacterial vaginosis, HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhoea,&amp;nbsp;syphilis,&amp;nbsp;and malaria.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Immune status===
Autoimmunity is possible cause of recurrent or late-term miscarriages. In the case of an autoimmune-induced miscarriages the woman's body attacks the growing fetus or prevents normal pregnancy progression.&lt;ref name="CarpSelmi2012"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=The autoimmune bases of infertility and pregnancy loss|journal=J Autoimmun|type=Review|volume=38|issue=2–3|pages=J266–74|doi=10.1016/j.jaut.2011.11.016|pmid=22284905|vauthors=Carp HJ, Selmi C, Shoenfeld Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=Female infertility due to abnormal autoimmunity: Frequently overlooked and greatly underappreciated.

===Anatomical defects and trauma===
Fifteen percent of women who have experienced three or more recurring miscarriages have some anatomical defect that prevents the pregnancy from being carried for the entire term.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=181}} The structure of the [[uterus]] has an effect on the ability to carry a child to term. Anatomical differences are common and can be congenital.

In some women, [[cervical incompetence]] or cervical insufficiency occurs with the inability of the cervix to stay closed during the entire pregnancy.&lt;ref name="American College of Obstetricians and 372–9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It does not cause first trimester miscarriages. In the second trimester it is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. It is identified after a premature birth has occurred at about 16–18 weeks into the pregnancy.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=181}} During the second trimester, major trauma can result in a miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=172}}

===Smoking===
{{See also|Smoking and pregnancy}}
Tobacco (cigarette) smokers have an increased risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; There is an increased risk regardless of which parent smokes, though the risk is higher when the gestational mother smokes.&lt;ref name="paternal smoking"/&gt;

===Morning sickness===
Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP, or [[morning sickness]]) are associated with a decreased risk. Several possible causes have been suggested for morning sickness but there is still no agreement.&lt;ref name="Kor2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koren|first1=G|title=Treating morning sickness in the United States--changes in prescribing are needed|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=December 2014|volume=211|issue=6|pages=602–6|pmid=25151184|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2014.08.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; NVP may represent a defense mechanism which discourages the mother's ingestion of foods that are harmful to the fetus; according to this model, a lower frequency of miscarriage would be an expected consequence of the different food choices made by women experiencing NVP.&lt;ref name=Haviland2016&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FPgWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=nausea+vomiting+pregnancy+defense+mechanism+2017&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjj9q4yoveAhUKJMAKHbmoAnAQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=nausea%20vomiting%20pregnancy%20defense%20mechanism%202017&amp;f=false|title=Anthropology: The Human Challenge|last=Haviland|first=William A.|last2=Prins|first2=Harald E.

===Chemicals and occupational exposure===
Chemical and [[occupational exposure]]s may have some effect in pregnancy outcomes. A cause and effect relationship almost can never be established. Those chemicals that are implicated in increasing the risk for miscarriage are [[DDT]], [[lead]], [[formaldehyde]], [[arsenic]], [[benzene]] and [[ethylene oxide]]. [[Video display terminal]]s and ultrasound have not been found to have an effect on the rates of miscarriage. In dental offices where [[nitrous oxide]] is used with the absence of [[anesthetic gas scavenging equipment]], there is a greater risk of miscarriage. For women who work with cytotoxic [[antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agent]]s there is a small increased risk of miscarriage. No increased risk for [[cosmetologist]]s has been found.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=272}}

==Diagnosis==
In the case of blood loss, pain, or both, [[Obstetric ultrasonography|transvaginal ultrasound]] is performed.  If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is not found with ultrasound, blood tests (serial [[human chorionic gonadotropin|βHCG]] tests) can be performed to rule out ectopic pregnancy, which is a life-threatening situation.&lt;ref name="followHCG"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Condous G, Okaro E, Khalid A, Bourne T | title = Do we need to follow up complete miscarriages with serum human chorionic gonadotrophin levels? | journal = BJOG | volume = 112 | issue = 6 | pages = 827–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15924545 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2004.00542.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bmj&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us.bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/666.html|title=Miscarriage|last=BMJ Best Practice|first=|date=|website=us.bestpractice.bmj.com|language=en|others=Ida Muslim, Jothi Doraiswamy, Acknowledgements|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultrasound criteria===
A review article in [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] based on a consensus meeting of the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound in America (SRU) has suggested that miscarriage should be diagnosed only if any of the following criteria are met upon ultrasonography visualization:&lt;ref name="Doubilet2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doubilet PM, Benson CB, Bourne T, Blaivas M, Barnhart KT, Benacerraf BR, Brown DL, Filly RA, Fox JC, Goldstein SR, Kendall JL, Lyons EA, Porter MB, Pretorius DH, Timor-Tritsch IE | title = Diagnostic Criteria for Nonviable Pregnancy Early in the First Trimester | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 15 | pages = 1443–1451 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24106937 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1302417 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
A threatened miscarriage describes any bleeding during pregnancy, prior to viability, that has yet to be assessed.. At investigation it may be found that the fetus remains viable and the pregnancy continues without further problems.{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2017}}

An [[Anembryonic gestation|anembryonic pregnancy]] (also called an "empty sac" or "blighted ovum") is a condition where the [[gestational sac]] develops normally, while the embryonic part of the pregnancy is either absent or stops growing very early. This accounts for approximately half of miscarriages. All other miscarriages are classified as embryonic miscarriages, meaning that there is an embryo present in the gestational sac. Half of embryonic miscarriages have [[aneuploidy]] (an abnormal number of chromosomes).&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;

An inevitable miscarriage occurs when the cervix has already dilated,&lt;ref name="isbn 0-07-144874-8"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Latha |last1=Stead |first2=S. Matthew |last2=Stead |first3=Matthew |last3=Kaufman|first4=Luis |last4=Suarez |title=First Aid for The Obstetrics and Gynecology Clerkship |publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York |year=2006 |page=138 |isbn=978-0-07-144874-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the fetus has yet to be expelled. This usually will progress to a complete miscarriage. The fetus may or may not have cardiac activity.

[[File:Complete miscarriage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Transvaginal ultrasonography]] after an episode of heavy bleeding in an intrauterine pregnancy that had been confirmed by a previous ultrasononography. There is some widening between the [[uterine wall]]s, but no sign of any [[gestational sac]], thus in this case being diagnostic of a complete miscarriage.]] A complete miscarriage is when all products of conception have been expelled; these may include the [[trophoblast]], [[chorionic villi]], [[gestational sac]], [[yolk sac]], and [[fetal pole]] ([[embryo]]); or later in pregnancy the [[fetus]], [[umbilical cord]], [[placenta]], amniotic fluid, and [[amniotic sac|amniotic membrane]]. The presence of a [[pregnancy test]] that is still positive as well as an empty uterus upon [[transvaginal ultrasonography]] does, however, fulfill the definition of [[pregnancy of unknown location]]. Therefore, there may be a need for follow-up pregnancy tests to ensure that there is no remaining pregnancy, including an ectopic pregnancy. [[File:Incomplete miscarriage.jpg|thumb|[[Transvaginal ultrasonography]], with some products of conception in the [[cervix]] (to the left in the image) and remnants of a [[gestational sac]] by the [[fundus of the uterus|fundus]] (to the right in the image), indicating an incomplete miscarriage.]] An incomplete miscarriage occurs when some [[products of conception]] have been passed, but some remains inside the uterus.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus"&gt;{{cite web |author=MedlinePlus | authorlink =MedlinePlus | date = October 25, 2004 |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000904.htm | title =Abortion – incomplete | website=Medical Encyclopedia| accessdate =May 24, 2006 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060425090648/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000904.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an increased distance between the [[uterine wall]]s on transvaginal ultrasonography may also simply be an increased endometrial thickness and/or a [[polyp]]. The use of a Doppler ultrasound may be better in confirming the presence of significant retained products of conception in the uterine cavity.&lt;ref name="kirk2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirk E, Bottomley C, Bourne T | title = Diagnosing ectopic pregnancy and current concepts in the management of pregnancy of unknown location | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 250–61 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24101604 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt047 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases of uncertainty, [[ectopic pregnancy]] must be excluded using techniques like serial [[beta-hCG]] measurements.&lt;ref name="kirk2013" /&gt;
{{anchor|missed}}[[File:Delayed or missed miscarriage at 13 weeks.gif|thumb|left|160px|A 13-week fetus without cardiac activity located in the uterus (delayed or missed miscarriage)]]A missed miscarriage is when the embryo or fetus has died, but a miscarriage has not yet occurred.  It is also referred to as delayed miscarriage, silent miscarriage, or missed abortion.&lt;ref name="Farquharson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchon-1997"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hutchon DJ | title = Missed abortion versus delayed miscarriage | journal = British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology | volume = 104 | issue = 6 | pages = 753 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9197887 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.1997.tb11994.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Septic abortion|septic miscarriage]] occurs when the tissue from a missed or incomplete miscarriage becomes infected, which carries the risk of spreading infection ([[septicaemia]]) and can be fatal.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;

[[Recurrent miscarriage]] ("recurrent pregnancy loss" (RPL) or "habitual abortion") is the occurrence of multiple consecutive miscarriages; the exact number used to diagnose recurrent miscarriage varies.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt; If the proportion of pregnancies ending in miscarriage is 15% and assuming that miscarriages are independent events,&lt;ref name="rcog2003" /&gt; then the probability of two consecutive miscarriages is 2.25% and the probability of three consecutive miscarriages is 0.34%. The occurrence of recurrent pregnancy loss is 1%.&lt;ref name="rcog2003"&gt;{{cite web |author=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |authorlink=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |date=May 2003 |title=The investigation and treatment of couples with recurrent miscarriage |website=Green-top Guideline No. 17 |url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/womens-health/clinical-guidance/investigation-and-treatment-couples-recurrent-miscarriage-green-top- |accessdate=October 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104235744/http://www.rcog.org.uk/womens-health/clinical-guidance/investigation-and-treatment-couples-recurrent-miscarriage-green-top- |archivedate=January 4, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority (85%) of those who have had two miscarriages will conceive and carry normally afterward.

The physical symptoms of a miscarriage vary according to the length of pregnancy, though most miscarriages cause pain or cramping. The size of blood clots and pregnancy tissue that are passed become larger with longer gestations. After 13 weeks' gestation, there is a higher risk of placenta retention.&lt;ref name="ausbirth"&gt;{{cite web| date=October 2004| title=miscarriage| url=http://www.birth.com.au/Info.asp?class=6620&amp;page=13| accessdate=3 January 2014| author=Home page at www.birth.com.au| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201112940/http://www.birth.com.au/Info.asp?class=6620&amp;page=13| archivedate=December 1, 2008| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Prevention of a miscarriage can sometimes be accomplished by decreasing risk factors.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Pre" /&gt; This may include good [[prenatal care]], avoiding drugs and alcohol, preventing infectious diseases, and avoiding x-rays.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Pre" /&gt; Identifying the cause of the miscarriage may help prevent future pregnancy loss, especially in cases of recurrent miscarriage. Often there is little a person can do to prevent a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Pre" /&gt; Vitamin supplementation before or during pregnancy has not been found to affect the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2016|title=Vitamin supplementation for preventing miscarriage|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=5|issue=5|pages=CD004073|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004073.pub4|pmid=27150280|vauthors=Balogun OO, da Silva Lopes K, Ota E, Takemoto Y, Rumbold A, Takegata M, Mori R|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modifiable risk factors===
Maintaining a healthy weight and good pre-natal care can reduce the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Some risk factors can be minimized by avoiding the following:
*Smoking&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;&lt;ref name="paternal smoking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
*Cocaine use&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;

*Drug abuse&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Management==
Women who miscarry early in their pregnancy usually do not require any subsequent medical treatment but they can benefit from support and counseling.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jeve"/&gt; Most early miscarriages will complete on their own; in other cases, medication treatment or aspiration of the products of conception can be used to remove remaining tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babycentre.co.uk/a1039515/understanding-early-miscarriage#ixzz2x52G1IYu |title=Understanding early miscarriage |date=January 2017 |accessdate=June 4, 2017 |publisher=BabyCenter, L.L.C. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905095051/https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a1039515/understanding-early-miscarriage#ixzz2x52G1IYu |archivedate=September 5, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[bed rest]] has been advocated to prevent miscarriage, this has not been found to be of benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christina A.|last1=McCall|first2=David A.|last2=Grimes|first3=Anne Drapkin|last3=Lyerly|title="Therapeutic" bed rest in pregnancy: unethical and unsupported by data|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=1 June 2013|issn=1873-233X|pages=1305–1308|volume=121|issue=6|pmid=23812466|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e318293f12f}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hoffman|page = 176}} Those who are or who have experienced an abortion benefit from the use of careful medical language. Significant distress can often be managed by the ability of the clinician to clearly explain terms without suggesting that the woman or couple are somehow to blame.&lt;ref name="Chris2014"&gt;{{cite book|title=Recurrent pregnancy loss|last=Christiansen|first=Ole|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2014|isbn=9780470672945|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|pages=98–99|quote=It is important to bear in mind that some clinical terms can cause great distress and even anger.  It is not acceptable to use the term "abortion" for miscarriage, despite its historical clinical prevalence.

"Miscarriage" (qualified by adjectives such as recurrent, delayed, early, late, etc.) is easily understood and well accepted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence to support [[Rho(D) immune globulin]] after a spontaneous miscarriage is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karanth|first1=L|last2=Jaafar|first2=SH|last3=Kanagasabai|first3=S|last4=Nair|first4=NS|last5=Barua|first5=A|title=Anti-D administration after spontaneous miscarriage for preventing Rhesus alloimmunisation|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Mar 28, 2013|volume=3|issue=3|pages=CD009617|pmid=23543581|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009617.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, Rho(D) immune globulin is recommended in Rh-negative women after 12 weeks [[gestational age]] and before 12 weeks gestational age in those who need surgery or medication to complete the miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Royal College of Obstetric and Gynecologists|title=The Use of Anti-D Immunoglobulin for Rhesus D Prophylaxis|url=https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg22antidjuly2013.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2014|page=5|date=March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128192127/https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg22antidjuly2013.pdf|archivedate=November 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods===
No treatment is necessary for a diagnosis of complete miscarriage (so long as ectopic pregnancy is ruled out). In cases of an incomplete miscarriage, empty sac, or missed abortion there are three treatment options: watchful waiting, medical management, and surgical treatment. With no treatment ([[watchful waiting]]), most miscarriages (65–80%) will pass naturally within two to six weeks.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kripke C | title = Expectant management vs. surgical treatment for miscarriage | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 74 | issue = 7 | pages = 1125–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17039747 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/1001/p1125.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140525195924/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/1001/p1125.html | archivedate = May 25, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment avoids the possible side effects and complications of medications and surgery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tang OS, Ho PC | title = The use of misoprostol for early pregnancy failure | journal = Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 581–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17099326 | doi = 10.1097/GCO.0b013e32800feedb }}&lt;/ref&gt; but increases the risk of mild bleeding, need for unplanned surgical treatment, and incomplete miscarriage. Medical treatment usually consists of using [[misoprostol]] (a [[prostaglandin]]) to contract the uterus, expelling remaining tissue out of the cervix. This works within a few days in 95% of cases.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;  Vacuum aspiration or sharp curettage can be used, though vacuum aspiration is lower-risk and more common.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;

===Delayed and incomplete miscarriage===
In delayed or incomplete miscarriage, treatment depends on the amount of tissue remaining in the uterus. Treatment can include surgical removal of the tissue with [[vacuum aspiration]] or [[misoprostol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333519/|title=Surgery for Family Planning, Abortion, and Postabortion Care|last=Babigumira|first=Joseph B.|last2=Vlassoff|first2=Michael|last3=Ahimbisibwe|first3=Asa|last4=Stergachis|first4=Andy|date=2015-01-01|publisher=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank|isbn=9781464803468|editor-last=Debas|editor-first=Haile T.|location=Washington (DC)|pmid=26741012|editor-last2=Donkor|editor-first2=Peter|editor-last3=Gawande|editor-first3=Atul|editor-last4=Jamison|editor-first4=Dean T.|editor-last5=Kruk|editor-first5=Margaret E.|editor-last6=Mock|editor-first6=Charles N.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910181311/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333519/|archivedate=September 10, 2017|df=mdy-all|doi=10.1596/978-1-4648-0346-8_ch7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies looking at the methods of anaesthesia for surgical management of incomplete miscarriage have not shown that any adaptation from normal practice is beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calvache|first1=JA|last2=Delgado-Noguera|first2=MF|last3=Lesaffre|first3=E|last4=Stolker|first4=RJ|title=Anaesthesia for evacuation of incomplete miscarriage|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=18 April 2012|issue=4|pages=CD008681|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008681.pub2|pmid=22513963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations recommend delaying sexual relations immediately after a miscarriage to prevent [[infection]].&lt;ref name="misorg" /&gt; However, there is not sufficient evidence for the routine use of antibiotic to try to avoid infection in incomplete abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=May|first1=W|last2=Gülmezoglu|first2=AM|last3=Ba-Thike|first3=K|title=Antibiotics for incomplete abortion|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=17 October 2007|issue=4|pages=CD001779|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001779.pub2|pmid=17943756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every woman's personal experience of miscarriage is different, and women who have more than one miscarriage may react differently to each event.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reagan|first=Leslie J.|date=2003|title=From Hazard to Blessing to Tragedy: Representations of Miscarriage in Twentieth-Century America|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=29|issue=2|pages=357–378|jstor=3178514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women are able to begin planning their next pregnancy after a few weeks of having the miscarriage. For others, planning another pregnancy can be difficult.&lt;ref name="uk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="misorg"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.miscarriageassociation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Thinking-about-another-pregnancy.pdf | title = Thinking About Another Pregnancy | publisher = Miscarriage Association | accessdate = 4 September 2017 | date = 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170905051002/https://www.miscarriageassociation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Thinking-about-another-pregnancy.pdf | archivedate = September 5, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some facilities acknowledge the loss. Parents can name and hold their infant. They may be given mementos such as photos and footprints. Some conduct a funeral or memorial service.

===Subsequent pregnancies===
Some parents want to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The decision of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and want to know about the risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one [[menstrual cycle]] before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage or [[molar pregnancy]], or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.&lt;ref name="misorg"/&gt;

The risks of having another miscarriage vary according to the cause. The risk of having another miscarriage after a molar pregnancy is very low. The risk of another miscarriage is highest after the third miscarriage. Pre-conception care is available in some locales.&lt;ref name="misorg" /&gt;

===Later cardiovascular disease===
There is a significant association between miscarriage and later development of [[coronary artery disease]], but not of [[cerebrovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oliver-Williams CT, Heydon EE, Smith GC, Wood AM | title = Miscarriage and future maternal cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Heart | volume = 99 | issue = 22 | pages = 1636–1644 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23539554 | pmc = 3812894 | doi = 10.1136/heartjnl-2012-303237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hoffman|page = 172}}

==Epidemiology==
Among women who know they are pregnant, the miscarriage rate is roughly 10% to 20%, while rates among all [[Fertilisation|fertilized zygotes]] are around 30% to 50%.&lt;ref name="John2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NIH2013Epi" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name="jeve" /&gt; A 2012 review found the risk of miscarriage between 5 and 20 weeks from 11% to 22%.&lt;ref name=Avalos-2012 /&gt; Up to the 13th week of pregnancy, the risk of miscarriage each week was around 2%, dropping to 1% in week 14 and reducing slowly between 14 and 20 weeks.&lt;ref name=Avalos-2012 /&gt;

The precise rate is not known because a large number of miscarriages occur before pregnancies become established and before the woman is aware they are pregnant.&lt;ref name="Avalos-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ammon Avalos L, Galindo C, Li DK | title = A systematic review to calculate background miscarriage rates using life table analysis | journal = Birth Defects Research. Part A, Clinical and Molecular Teratology | volume = 94 | issue = 6 | pages = 417–23 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22511535 | doi = 10.1002/bdra.23014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, those with bleeding in early pregnancy may seek medical care more often than those not experiencing bleeding.&lt;ref name="Avalos-2012" /&gt; Although some studies attempt to account for this by recruiting women who are planning pregnancies and testing for very early pregnancy, they still are not representative of the wider population.&lt;ref name="Avalos-2012" /&gt;

The prevalence of miscarriage increases with the age of both parents.&lt;ref name=Avalos-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nybo Andersen AM, Wohlfahrt J, Christens P, Olsen J, Melbye M | title = Maternal age and fetal loss: Population based register linkage study | journal = BMJ | volume = 320 | issue = 7251 | pages = 1708–12 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10864550 | pmc = 27416 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7251.1708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kleinhaus K, Perrin M, Friedlander Y, Paltiel O, Malaspina D, Harlap S | title = Paternal Age and Spontaneous Abortion | journal = Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = 369–77 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16880308 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000224606.26514.3a }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Slama R, Bouyer J, Windham G, Fenster L, Werwatz A, Swan SH | title = Influence of Paternal Age on the Risk of Spontaneous Abortion | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 161 | issue = 9 | pages = 816–23 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15840613 | doi = 10.1093/aje/kwi097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Danish register-based study where the prevalence of miscarriage was 11%, the prevalence rose from 9% at 22 years of age to 84% by 48 years of age.&lt;ref name=Andersen /&gt;{{Update inline|date=October 2017}} Another, later study in 2013 found that when either parent was over the age of 40, the rate of known miscarriages doubled.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;

In 2010, 50,000 inpatient admissions for miscarriage occurred in the UK.&lt;ref name="radford" /&gt;

==Terminology==
Most affected women and family members refer to miscarriage as the loss of a baby, rather than an embryo or fetus, and healthcare providers are expected to respect and use the language that the person chooses.&lt;ref name="Chris2014" /&gt; Clinical terms can suggest blame, increase distress, and even cause anger. Terms that are known to cause distress in those experiencing miscarriage include:

* ''abortion'' (including ''spontaneous abortion'') rather than miscarriage, 
* ''habitual aborter'' rather than a woman experiencing [[recurrent pregnancy loss]], 
* ''products of conception'' rather than [[baby]], 
* ''blighted ovum'' rather than early pregnancy loss or delayed miscarriage, 
* ''cervical incompetence'' rather than [[cervical weakness]], and 
* ''evacuation of retained products of conception'' (ERPC) rather than [[surgical management of miscarriage]].&lt;ref name="Chris2014" /&gt;

''Pregnancy loss'' is a broad term that describes miscarriage, ectopic and molar pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Chris2014" /&gt; The term ''[[fetal death]]'' applies variably in different countries and contexts, sometimes incorporating weight, and gestational age from 16 weeks in Norway, 20 weeks in the US and Australia, 24 weeks in the UK to 26 weeks in Italy and Spain.&lt;ref name="Mohangoo-2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mohangoo AD, Blondel B, Gissler M, Velebil P, Macfarlane A, Zeitlin J | title = International comparisons of fetal and neonatal mortality rates in high-income countries: should exclusion thresholds be based on birth weight or gestational age? | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = e64869 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23700489 | pmc = 3658983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0064869 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...864869M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIHW-2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Li|first=Z|title=Australia's Mothers and Babies 2010|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=60129542372|website=Perinatal statistics series no. 27.

==History==

Some medical authors advocated change to use of ''miscarriage'' instead of ''spontaneous abortion'' because they argued this would be more respectful and help ease a distressing experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beard RW, Mowbray JF, Pinker GD | title = Miscarriage or abortion | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 8464 | pages = 1122–3 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2865589 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(85)90709-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hutchon DJ, Cooper S | title = Terminology for early pregnancy loss must be changed | journal = BMJ | volume = 317 | issue = 7165 | pages = 1081 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9774309 | pmc = 1114078 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.317.7165.1081 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=October 2017}} The change was being recommended by some in the profession in Britain in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=Hutchon-1998&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hutchon DJ, Cooper S | title = Terminology for early pregnancy loss must be changed | journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 317 | issue = 7165 | pages = 1081 | date = Oct 17, 1998 | pmid = 9774309 | pmc = 1114078 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.317.7165.1081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) published a paper aiming to facilitate a revision of nomenclature used to describe early pregnancy events.&lt;ref name=Farquharson&gt;{{cite journal | author = Farquharson RG, Jauniaux E, Exalto N | title = Updated and revised nomenclature for description of early pregnancy events | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 20 | issue = 11 | pages = 3008–11 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16006453 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/dei167 | author4 = ESHRE Special Interest Group for Early Pregnancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Society's reactions to miscarriage changed over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;In the early 20th century, the focus was on the mother's physical health and the difficulties and disabilities that miscarriage could produce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Other reactions, such as the expense of medical treatments and relief at ending an unwanted pregnancy, were also heard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the 1940s and 1950s, people were more likely to express relief, not because the miscarriage ended an unwanted or mistimed pregnancy, but because people believed that miscarriages were primarily caused by birth defects, and miscarrying meant that the family would not raise a child with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The dominant attitude in the mid-century was that a miscarriage, although temporarily distressing, was a blessing in disguise for the family, and that another pregnancy and a healthier baby would soon follow, especially if women trusted physicians and reduced their anxieties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Media articles were illustrated with pictures of babies, and magazine articles about miscarriage ended by introducing the healthy baby—usually a boy—that had shortly followed it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Beginning in the 1980s, miscarriage in the US was primarily framed in terms of the individual woman's personal emotional reaction, and especially her grief over a tragic outcome.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The subject was portrayed in the media with images of an empty crib or an isolated, grieving woman, and stories about miscarriage were published in general-interest media outlets, not just [[women's magazines]] or health magazines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Family members were encouraged to grieve, to memorialize their losses through funerals and other rituals, and to think of themselves as being parents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;This shift to recognizing these emotional responses was partly due to medical and political successes, which created an expectation that pregnancies are typically planned and safe, and to women's demands that their emotional reactions no longer be dismissed by the medical establishments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;It also reinforces the [[Pro-Life movement|pro-life movement's]] belief that human life begins at conception or early in pregnancy, and that [[Pronatalism|motherhood is a desirable life goal]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The modern one-size-fits-all model of grief does not fit every woman's experience, and an expectation to [[Performativity|perform]] grief creates unnecessary burdens for some women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reframing of miscarriage as a private emotional experience brought less awareness of miscarriage and a sense of silence around the subject, especially compared to the public discussion of miscarriage during campaigns for access to birth control during the early 20th century, or the public campaigns to prevent miscarriages, stillbirths, and infant deaths by reducing industrial pollution during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/04/the-history-of-talking-about-miscarriage.html|title=The History of Talking About Miscarriage|last=Blei|first=Daniela|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In places where induced abortion is illegal or carries social stigma, suspicion may surround miscarriage, complicating an already sensitive issue.

In the 1960s, the use of the word ''miscarriage'' in Britain (instead of ''spontaneous abortion'') occurred after changes in legislation.

Developments in ultrasound technology (in the early 1980s) allowed them to identify earlier miscarriages.&lt;ref name="pmid23429567" /&gt;

According to French statutes, an infant born before the age of viability, determined to be 28 weeks, is not registered as a 'child'. If birth occurs after this, the infant is granted a certificate that allows women who have given birth to a stillborn child, to have a symbolic record of that child. This certificate can include a registered and given name with the purpose of allowing a funeral and acknowledgement of the event.&lt;ref&gt;Communiqué de presse de [[Rachida Dati]], Garde des Sceaux, ministre de la Justice et de [[Roselyne Bachelot|Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin]], ministre de la Santé, de la Jeunesse, des Sports et de la Vie associative, « Possibilité de demande d’un acte d’enfant sans vie », 22 août 2008, [http://www.sante.gouv.fr/possibilite-de-demande-d-un-acte-d-enfant-sans-vie.html lire en ligne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.service-public.fr/|title=Accueil Particuliers {{!}} service-public.fr|website=www.service-public.fr|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Décret n°74-449 du 15 mai 1974 relatif au livret de famille et à l'information des futurs époux sur le droit de la famille - Article 9|date=15 May 1974|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006285245&amp;cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000328986|accessdate=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
{{anchor|In animals}}
Miscarriage occurs in all animals that experience pregnancy, though in such contexts it is more commonly referred to as a "spontaneous abortion" (the two terms are synonymous). There are a variety of known risk factors in non-human animals. For example, in sheep, miscarriage may be caused by crowding through doors, or being chased by dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, James.

He was born in [[Kristiansand]] and graduated from the [[University of Oslo]] with the [[cand.real.]] degree in 1967. He worked as a consultant in the [[Ministry of Education and Research (Norway)|Ministry of Education and Church Affairs]] and at a teachers' college before being assisting chief executive at [[NKI Fjernundervisning|NKI-skolen]]. During [[Korvald's Cabinet]] from 1972 to 1973, he was a [[State Secretary (Norway)|State Secretary]], first in the [[Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development|Ministry of Local Government and Labour]], then in the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Norway)|Office of the Prime Minister]]. After that he held another political position, secretary-general of the [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democratic Party]], before he was director of enterprise in [[Vestfold County Municipality]]. He was then a director in [[Anders Jahre (company)|Anders Jahre]]/[[Kosmos (company)|Kosmos]] from 1982 to 1988, before being hired as chief executive officer of [[Sparebanken Pluss]].&lt;ref name=60y&gt;{{cite news|title=Oluf Arntsen 60 år 22. mars|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=2 March 2001|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired in 2001 and was replaced by Stein A.

The chief executive [[Steinar Stokke]] had to step down from several hospital boards in May 2003 because of a flawed project where patient diagnoses was to be coded in different ways to be eligible for public funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Helse Sør-sjef trekker seg fra styreverv|last=Hafstad|first=Anne|author2=Gedde-Dahl, Siri|date=14 May 2003|work=Aftenposten|page=4|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2004, Arntsen tried to oust Stokke from the executive chair, following the "coding case" as well as roundhanded pension deals with company executives. Arntsen was supported by deputy chair [[Helen Bjørnøy]] and board member [[Ole Johan Sandvand]], but was voted down by the rest of the board ([[Kaare Norum]], [[Einfrid Halvorsen]], Anne Mo Grimdalen, Terje Keyn, Morten Falkenberg and Svein Øverland). Arntsen subsequently had to resign, but in response, the Minister of Health [[Dagfinn Høybråten]] promptly relieved the entire board of their positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Høybråten kaster Helse Sør-styret|last=Hafstad|first=Anne|author2=Gedde-Dahl, Siri|date=27 January 2004|work=Aftenposten|page=12|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stokke resigned the next month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steinar Stokke får ett års etterlønn|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=18 February 2004|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''payment card industry''' ('''PCI''') denotes the [[debit]], [[Credit (finance)|credit]], [[Stored-value card|prepaid]], [[e-purse]], [[Automated teller machine|ATM]], and [[Point of sale|POS]] cards and associated businesses.

== Overview ==
The payment card industry consists of all the organizations which store, process and transmit cardholder data, most notably for [[debit card]]s and [[credit card]]s. The security standards are developed by the [[Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council]] which develops the [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]]s used throughout the industry. Individual card brands establish compliance requirements that are used by service providers and have their own compliance programs. Major card brands include [[American Express]], [[Discover Card|Discover Financial Services]], [[China UnionPay]],  [[Japan Credit Bureau]], [[MasterCard|MasterCard Worldwide]] and [[Visa (company)|Visa International]]. Most companies use member banks that connect and accept transactions from the card brands. Not all card brands use member banks, like American Express, these instead act as their own bank.&lt;ref name="sdcr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdcr.com/pci-pdfs/Compliance-Overview-PCI.pdf | title=A Compliance Overview for the Payment Card Industry (PCI) | publisher=Coalfire Systems Inc. 2009 | date=2009 | accessdate=1 August 2014 | author=McAndrew, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2014}}, the United States uses a [[magnetic stripe]] on a card to process transactions and its security relies on the holder's signature and visual inspection of the card to check for features such as [[hologram]]. This system will be outmoded and replaced by [[EMV]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=ars /&gt;{{Update inline|date=February 2018}} EMV is a global standard for inter-operation of [[smart card|integrated circuit card]]s (IC cards or "chip cards") and IC card capable [[point of sale]] (POS) terminals and [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs), for authenticating [[credit card|credit]] and [[debit card]] transactions. It has enhanced security features, but is still susceptible to fraud.&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2014/08/chip-based-credit-cards-are-a-decade-old-why-doesnt-the-us-rely-on-them-yet/ | title=Chip-based credit cards are a decade old; why doesn’t the US rely on them yet? | work=[[Ars Technica]] | date=2 August 2014 | accessdate=2 August 2014 | author=Geuss, Megan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1 August 2014, the PCI SSC website lists 688 "Participating Organizations".&lt;ref name="total"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/get_involved/member_list.php/member_list.php?category=&amp;region=&amp;alphaFilter= | title=Participating Organizations | publisher=Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council | accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, 61 different financial institutions were noted, including [[Bank of America]], [[Capital One]], [[JP Morgan Chase]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Toronto-Dominion Bank|TD Bank]] and [[Wells Fargo]].&lt;ref name=total /&gt; A total of 275 merchants were listed,  including [[Amazon.com]], [[Burger King]], [[Citgo]], [[Dell]], [[Equifax]], [[Exxon Mobil]], [[Global Cash Access]], [[Motorola]], [[Microsoft]], [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Walmart]].&lt;ref name=total /&gt;

== Industry growth ==
MasterCard's Nicole Krieg has noted that the Russian credit card market started in early 2000, when issuers first began launching products.&lt;ref name=cardline /&gt; However, credit products became especially popular in Russia in 2005, after new legislation took effect. Immense growth was noted in just eight years, by comparing second quarter growth on Visa card purchases, which went from $306 million in 2002 to $61.5 billion in 2010. Merchants who accepted Visa cards also increased from 21,000 to 331,000 during the same period. Visa also noted that they had issued 70 million cards and the [[Central Bank of the Russian Federation]] reported that 8.6 million credit cards were on issue.&lt;ref name="cardline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-239403845.html | title=Card Brands, Issuers Report Dramatic Rise In Russian Card Market | work=Cardline | date=15 October 2010 | accessdate=1 August 2014 |subscription= yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]] | author=Peshkov, Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stix family''' is a prominent American [[American Jews|Jewish]] family from [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  William Stix, the progenitor, founded Rice-Stix, Inc., a manufacturer and wholesaler of dry goods that was described as the largest business in St. Louis at the time of the 1904 [[St. Louis World's Fair]].&lt;ref name="CohenPhilanthropist"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Robert|title=Ernest W. Stix, Jr. 95; businessman, artist, philanthropist|url=http://www.stljewishlight.com/obituaries/article_4bed76ec-f4eb-11e0-ae1e-001cc4c03286.html|accessdate=3 October 2017|publisher=[[St. Louis Jewish Light]]|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The firm, in St. Louis since 1879, moved in 1889 to a new headquarters in a [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] building designed by [[Isaac S.

== Summary ==
The book's overall theme points out while it is becoming easier to get power, it is also becoming harder to use it to control others and harder to keep it once you have it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/moises-naim/the-end-of-power/|title=THE END OF POWER by Moiss Nam {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naim suggests that globalization, economic growth, a growing global middle class, the spread of democracy, and rapidly expanding telecommunications technologies have changed our world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2013/03/quick-study-mois%C3%A9s-na%25C3%25ADm-power|title=It ain’t what it used to be|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2013/03/23/book-review-the-end-of-power-from-boardrooms-to-battlefields-and-churches-to-states-why-being-in-charge-isnt-what-it-used-to-be/|title=Book Review: The End of Power: From Boardrooms to Battlefields and Churches to States, Why Being In Charge Isn’t What It Used to Be by Moisés Naím|date=2013-03-23|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says these developments have created a fluid and unpredictable environment which has unsettled the traditional dominions of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://next.ft.com/content/a7c1a534-7464-11e2-80a7-00144feabdc0|title=The rule of more - FT.com|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5275">The '''thinking processes''' in  [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]]'s [[theory of constraints]] are the five methods to enable the [[focused improvement]] of any cognitive [[system]] (especially [[business]] systems).

==Purpose==
The purpose of the thinking processes is to help answer questions essential to achieving focused improvement: 
# ''What to change?''
# ''What to change it into?''
# ''How to cause the change?''

Sometimes two other questions are considered as well:
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Why Change?''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
and:
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''How to maintain the process of ongoing improvement (POOGI)?''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

A more thorough rationale is presented in ''What is this thing called Theory of Constraints and how should it be implemented''.&lt;ref name=what_is_TOC&gt;{{cite book |author=Goldratt, Eliyahu M. |title=What is this thing called Theory of Constraints and how should it be implemented |publisher=North River Press |location=[Croton-on-Hudson, NY] |year=1990 |pages=161 |isbn=0-88427-166-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more thorough work, mapping the use and evolution of the Thinking Processes, was conducted by Mabin et al.&lt;ref name="Seonmin2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seonmin Kim |author2=Victoria Jane Mabin |author3=John Davies |title=The theory of constraints thinking processes: retrospect and prospect |journal=International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages= 155–184 |year=2008 |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited |doi=10.1108/01443570810846883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processes==
The primary thinking processes, as codified by Goldratt and others:
* '''[[Current reality tree (Theory of constraints)|Current reality tree]]''' (CRT, similar to the current state map used by many organizations) &amp;mdash; evaluates the network of cause-effect relations between the undesirable effects (UDE's, also known as gap elements) and helps to pinpoint the root cause(s) of most of the undesirable effects.
* '''[[Evaporating Cloud]]''' (conflict resolution diagram or CRD) - solves conflicts that usually perpetuate the causes for an undesirable situation.
* '''[[Core Conflict Cloud]]''' (CCC) - A combination of conflict clouds based several UDE's.  Looking for deeper conflicts that create the undesirable effects.
* '''Future Reality Tree''' (FRT, similar to a future state map) - Once some actions (injections) are chosen (not necessarily detailed) to solve the root cause(s) uncovered in the CRT and to resolve the conflict in the CRD the FRT shows the future states of the system and helps to identify possible negative outcomes of the changes (Negative Branches) and to prune them before implementing the changes.
* '''[[Negative Branch Reservations]]''' (NBR) - Identify potential negative ramifications of any action (such as an injection, or a half-baked idea).  The goal of the NBR is to understand the causal path between the action and negative ramifications so that the negative effect can be "trimmed."
* '''Positive Reinforcement Loop''' (PRL) - Desired effect (DE) presented in FRT amplifies intermediate objective (IO) that is earlier (lower) in the tree. While intermediate objective is strengthened it positively affects this DE. Finding out PRLs makes FRT more sustaining.
* '''Prerequisite Tree''' (PRT) - states that all of the intermediate objectives necessary to carry out an action chosen and the obstacles that will be overcome in the process.
* '''Transition Tree''' (TT) - describes in great detail the action that will lead to the fulfillment of a plan to implement changes (outlined on a PRT or not).
* '''Strategy &amp; Tactics ''' (S&amp;T) - the overall project plan and metrics that will lead to a successful implementation and the ongoing loop through [[POOGI]]. Goldratt adapted three operating level performance measures—throughput, inventory and operating expense—and adopted three strategic performance measures—net income, return on investment, and cash flow—to maintain the change.

Some observers note that these processes are not fundamentally very different from some other management change models such as [[PDCA]] "Plan-Do-Check-Act" (aka "Plan-Do-Study-Act") or "Survey-Assess-Decide-Implement-Evaluate", but the way they can be used is clearer and more straightforward.
