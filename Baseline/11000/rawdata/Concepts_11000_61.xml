      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7989">In [[algebraic logic]], an '''action algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] which is both a [[residuated semilattice]] and a [[Kleene algebra]].  It adds the star or reflexive transitive closure operation of the latter to the former, while adding the left and right residuation or implication operations of the former to the latter.  Unlike [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]] and other modal logics of programs, for which programs and propositions form two distinct sorts, action algebra combines the two into a single sort.  It can be thought of as a variant of [[Heyting algebra|intuitionistic logic]] with star and with a noncommutative conjunction whose identity need not be the top element.  Unlike Kleene algebras, action algebras form a [[Algebraic variety|variety]], which furthermore is finitely axiomatizable, the crucial axiom being ''a''•(''a'' → ''a'')* ≤ ''a''.  Unlike models of the equational theory of Kleene algebras (the regular expression equations), the star operation of action algebras is reflexive transitive closure in every model of the equations.
__TOC__

==Definition==

An '''action algebra''' (''A'', ∨, 0, •, 1, ←, →, *) is an [[algebraic structure]] such that (''A'', ∨, •, 1, ←, →) forms a [[residuated semilattice]] while (''A'', ∨, 0, •, 1, *) forms a [[Kleene algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Now Kleene algebras are axiomatized with quasiequations, that is, implications between two or more equations, whence so are action algebras when axiomatized directly in this way.  However, action algebras have the advantage that they also have an equivalent axiomatization that is purely equational.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In the following we write the inequality ''a'' ≤ ''b'' as an abbreviation for the equation ''a'' ∨ ''b'' = ''b''.  This allows us to axiomatize the theory using inequalities yet still have a purely equational axiomatization when the inequalities are expanded to equalities.

The equations axiomatizing action algebra are those for a residuated semilattice, together with the following equations for star.
::: 1 ∨ ''a''*•''a''* ∨ ''a''  &amp;nbsp; ≤ &amp;nbsp; ''a''*
::: ''a''* ≤ (''a''∨''b'')*
::: (''a'' → ''a'')* &amp;nbsp; ≤ &amp;nbsp; ''a'' → ''a''

The first equation can be broken out into three equations, 1 ≤ ''a''*, ''a''*•''a''* ≤ ''a''*, and ''a'' ≤ ''a''*.  These force ''a''* to be reflexive, transitive,{{clarify|reason=These are properties of binary relations. Explain why a* can be considered as a binary relation.|date=June 2014}} and greater or equal to ''a'' respectively.  The second axiom asserts that star is monotone.  The third axiom can be written equivalently as ''a''•(''a''→''a'')* ≤ ''a'', a form which makes its role as induction more apparent.  These two axioms in conjunction with the axioms for a residuated semilattice force ''a''* to be the least reflexive transitive element of the semilattice greater or equal to ''a''.  Taking that as the definition of reflexive transitive closure of ''a'', we then have that for every element ''a'' of any action algebra, ''a''* is the reflexive transitive closure of ''a''.

The equational theory of the implication-free fragment of action algebras, those equations not containing → or ←, can be shown to coincide with the equational theory of Kleene algebras, also known as the [[regular expression]] equations.  In that sense the above axioms constitute a finite axiomatization of regular expressions.  Redko showed in 1967 that these equations had no finite axiomatization, for which [[John Horton Conway]] gave a shorter proof in 1971.  Salomaa gave an equation schema axiomatizing this theory which Kozen subsequently reformulated as a finite axiomatization using quasiequations or implications between equations, the crucial quasiequations being those of induction: if ''x''•''a'' ≤ ''x'' then ''x''•''a''* ≤ ''x'', and if ''a''•''x'' ≤ ''x'' then ''a''*•''x'' ≤ ''x''.  Kozen defined a Kleene algebra to be any model of this finite axiomatization.

Conway showed that the equational theory of regular expressions admit models in which ''a''* was not the reflexive transitive closure of ''a'', by giving a four-element model 0 ≤ 1 ≤ ''a'' ≤ ''a''* in which ''a''•''a'' = ''a''.  In Conway's model, ''a'' is reflexive and transitive, whence its reflexive transitive closure should be ''a''.  However the regular expressions do not enforce this, allowing ''a''* to be strictly greater than ''a''.  Such anomalous behavior is not possible in an action algebra.

==Examples==
Any [[Heyting algebra]] (and hence any [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]) is made an action algebra by taking • to be ∧ and ''a''* = 1.  This is necessary and sufficient for star because the top element 1 of a Heyting algebra is its only reflexive element, and is transitive as well as greater or equal to every element of the algebra.

The set 2&lt;sup&gt;Σ*&lt;/sup&gt; of all [[formal language]]s (sets of finite strings) over an alphabet Σ forms an action algebra with 0 as the empty set, 1 = {ε}, ∨ as union, • as concatenation, ''L''←''M'' as the set of all strings ''x'' such that ''xM'' ⊆ ''L'' (and dually for ''M''→''L''), and ''L''* as the set of all strings of strings in ''L'' (Kleene closure).

The set 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; of all binary relations on a set ''X'' forms an action algebra with 0 as the empty relation, 1 as the identity relation or equality, ∨ as union, • as relation composition, ''R''←''S'' as the relation consisting of all pairs (''x,y'') such that for all ''z'' in ''X'', ''ySz'' implies ''xRz'' (and dually for ''S''→''R''), and ''R*'' as the reflexive transitive closure of ''R'', defined as the union over all relations ''R''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for integers ''n'' ≥ 0.

The two preceding examples are power sets, which are [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebras]] under the usual set theoretic operations of union, intersection, and complement.  This justifies calling them '''Boolean action algebras'''.  The relational example constitutes a [[relation algebra]] equipped with an operation of reflexive transitive closure.  Note that every Boolean algebra is a Heyting algebra and therefore an action algebra by virtue of being an instance of the first example.

'''Agroecology''' is the study of [[applied ecology|ecological processes applied]] to [[agriculture|agricultural]] production systems. Bringing [[ecology#Fundamental principles of ecology|ecological principles]] to bear in [[agroecosystem]]s can suggest novel management approaches that would not otherwise be considered. The term is often used imprecisely and may refer to "a science, a movement, [or] a practice".&lt;ref&gt;Wezel, A., Bellon, S., Doré, T., Francis, C., Vallod, D., David, C. (2009). Agroecology as a science, a movement or a practice. A review. Agronomy for Sustainable Development (published online)&lt;/ref&gt; Agroecologists study a variety of agroecosystems. The field of agroecology is not associated with any one particular method of [[farming]], whether it be [[Organic farming|organic]], [[Integrated farming|integrated]], or [[Industrial agriculture|conventional]], [[Intensive farming|intensive]] or [[Extensive farming|extensive]]. However, it has much more in common with organic and integrated farming.&lt;ref&gt;Wibblemann et al. (2013) Mainstreaming Agroecology: Implications for Global Food and Farming Systems. {{cite web |url=http://futureoffood.org/pdfs/Coventry_University_2013_Maintstreaming_Agroecology.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522154628/http://futureoffood.org/pdfs/Coventry_University_2013_Maintstreaming_Agroecology.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological strategy==
Agroecologists do not unanimously oppose technology or inputs in agriculture but instead assess how, when, and if technology can be used in conjunction with natural, social and human assets.&lt;ref&gt;Pretty, Jules. 2008. Agricultural sustainability: concepts, principles and evidence. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, 363, 447-465.&lt;/ref&gt; Agroecology proposes a context- or site-specific manner of studying agroecosystems, and as such, it recognizes that there is no universal formula or recipe for the success and maximum well-being of an agroecosystem.  Thus, agroecology is not defined by certain management practices, such as the use of [[Biological control|natural enemies]] in place of [[insecticides]], or [[polyculture]] in place of [[monoculture]].

Instead, agroecologists may study questions related to the four system properties of agroecosystems: [[Ecology#Ecosystem productivity|productivity]], [[Ecological stability|stability]], [[sustainability]] and [[equitability]].&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Gordon R. 1985. Agroecosystem analysis. Agricultural Administration, 20, 31-55.&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to disciplines that are concerned with only one or some of these properties, agroecologists see all four properties as interconnected and integral to the success of an agroecosystem. Recognizing that these properties are found on varying spatial scales, agroecologists do not limit themselves to the study of agroecosystems at any one scale: gene-organism-population-community-ecosystem-landscape-biome, field-farm-community-region-state-country-continent-global.

Agroecologists study these four properties through an interdisciplinary lens, using natural sciences to understand elements of agroecosystems such as soil properties and plant-insect interactions, as well as using social sciences to understand the effects of farming practices on rural communities, economic constraints to developing new production methods, or cultural factors determining farming practices.

==Approaches==
Agroecologists do not always agree about what agroecology is or should be in the long-term. Different definitions of the term agroecology can be distinguished largely by the specificity with which one defines the term "ecology", as well as the term's potential political connotations. Definitions of agroecology, therefore, may be first grouped according to the specific contexts within which they situate agriculture.
Agroecology is defined by the [[OECD]] as "the study of the relation of agricultural crops and environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=81 Agroecology], Glossary of Statistical Terms&lt;/ref&gt; This definition refers to the "-ecology" part of "agroecology" narrowly as the natural environment. Following this definition, an agroecologist would study agriculture's various relationships with [[soil health]], water quality, air quality, meso- and micro-fauna, surrounding flora, environmental toxins, and other environmental contexts.

A more common definition of the word can be taken from Dalgaard et al., who refer to agroecology as the study of the interactions between plants, animals, humans and the environment within agricultural systems.  Consequently, agroecology is inherently multidisciplinary, including factors from [[agronomy]], [[ecology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]] and related disciplines.&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt; In this case, the "-ecology" portion of "agroecology is defined broadly to include social, cultural, and economic contexts as well. Francis et al. also expand the definition in the same way, but put more emphasis on the notion of food systems.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;

Agroecology is also defined differently according to geographic location. In the global south, the term often carries overtly political connotations. Such political definitions of the term usually ascribe to it the goals of social and economic justice; special attention, in this case, is often paid to the traditional farming knowledge of indigenous populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agroecology.org Agroecology.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422150352/http://www.agroecology.org/ |date=2006-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; North American and European uses of the term sometimes avoid the inclusion of such overtly political goals. In these cases, agroecology is seen more strictly as a scientific discipline with less specific social goals.

===Agro-population ecology===
This approach is derived from the science of ecology primarily based on [[population ecology]], which over the past three decades has been displacing the ecosystems biology of [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]].  Buttel explains the main difference between the two categories, saying that "the application of population ecology to agroecology involves the primacy not only of analyzing agroecosystems from the perspective of the [[population dynamics]] of their constituent species, and their relationships to [[climate]] and [[biogeochemistry]], but also there is a major emphasis placed on the role of [[genetics]]."&lt;ref name=buttel&gt;Buttel, Frederick. "Envisioning the Future Development of Farming in the USA: Agroecology between Extinction and Multifunctionality?" New Directions in Agroecology Research and Education (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous agroecology===

This concept was proposed by political ecologist Josep Garí to recognise and uphold the integrated agro-ecological practices of many indigenous peoples, who simultaneously and sustainably safeguard, manage and use ecosystems for agricultural, food, biodiversity and cultural purposes at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2001). Biodiversity and Indigenous Agroecology in Amazonia. Etnoecologica 5 (7): 21-37&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous agroecologies are not systems and practices halted in time, but keep co-evolving with new knowledge and resources, such as that provided by development projects, research initiatives and agro-biodiversity exchanges. In fact, the first agro-ecologists were indigenous peoples that advocated development policies and programmes to support their systems, rather than replacing them.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2000). The Political Ecology of Biodiversity. DPhil Dissertation, University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusive agroecology===
Rather than viewing agroecology as a subset of agriculture, Wojtkowski&lt;ref&gt;Wojtkowski, Paul A. (2002) Agroecological Perspectives in Agronomy, Forestry and Agroforestry. Science Publishers Inc., Enfield, NH, 356p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wojtkowski, Paul A. (2006) Introduction to Agroecology: Principles and Practices. Haworth Press, Binghamton, NY, 404p.&lt;/ref&gt; takes a more encompassing perspective. In this, natural ecology and agroecology are the major headings under ecology. Natural ecology is the study of organisms as they interact with and within natural environments. Correspondingly, agroecology is the basis for the land-use sciences. Here humans are the primary governing force for organisms within planned and managed, mostly terrestrial, environments.

As key headings, natural ecology and agroecology provide the theoretical base for their respective sciences. These theoretical bases overlap but differ in a major way. Economics has no role in the functioning of natural ecosystems whereas economics sets direction and purpose in agroecology.

Under agroecology are the three land-use sciences, [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], and [[agroforestry]]. Although these use their plant components in different ways, they share the same theoretical core.

Beyond this, the land-use sciences further subdivide. The subheadings include agronomy, [[organic farming]], traditional agriculture, [[permaculture]], and [[silviculture]]. Within this system of subdivisions, agroecology is philosophically neutral. The importance lies in providing a theoretical base hitherto lacking in the land-use sciences. This allows progress in biocomplex agroecosystems including the multi-species plantations of forestry and agroforestry.

==Applications==
To arrive at a point of view about a particular way of farming, an agroecologist would first seek to understand the contexts in which the farm(s) is(are) involved. Each farm may be inserted in a unique combination of factors or contexts. Each farmer may have their own premises about the meanings of an agricultural endeavor, and these meanings might be different from those of agroecologists. Generally, farmers seek a configuration that is viable in multiple contexts, such as family, financial, technical, political, logistical, market, environmental, spiritual. Agroecologists want to understand the behavior of those who seek livelihoods from plant and animal increase, acknowledging the organization and planning that is required to run a farm.

===Views on organic and non-organic milk production===

Because [[organic agriculture]] proclaims to sustain the health of soils, ecosystems, and people,&lt;ref&gt;IFOAM (International Federation for Organic Agriculture Movements)&lt;/ref&gt; it has much in common with Agroecology;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} this does not mean that Agroecology is synonymous with organic agriculture, nor that Agroecology views organic farming as the 'right' way of farming.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Also, it is important to point out that there are large differences in [[Organic food|organic standards]] among countries and certifying agencies.

Three of the main areas that agroecologists would look at in farms, would be: the environmental impacts, animal welfare issues, and the social aspects.

Environmental impacts caused by organic and non-organic milk production can vary significantly. For both cases, there are positive and negative environmental consequences.

Compared to conventional milk production, [[organic milk]] production tends to have lower [[eutrophication]] potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and phosphates (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of [[methane]].&lt;ref&gt;Boer, I J. M. 2003. Environmental impact assessment of conventional and organic milk production. Livestock Production Science. Vol 80, p 69–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Animal welfare]] issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

A key component of animal welfare is freedom to perform their innate (natural) behavior, and this is stated in one of the basic principles of organic agriculture. Also, there are other aspects of animal welfare to be considered – such as freedom from hunger, thirst, discomfort, injury, fear, distress, disease and pain. Because organic standards require loose housing systems, adequate bedding, restrictions on the area of slatted floors, a minimum [[forage]] proportion in the [[ruminant]] diets, and tend to limit stocking densities both on [[pasture]] and in housing for dairy cows, they potentially promote good foot and hoof health. Some studies show lower incidence of placenta retention, milk fever, abomasums displacement and other diseases in organic than in conventional dairy herds.&lt;ref&gt;Hovi, M. el al. 2003. Animal health and welfare in organic livestock production in Europe: current state and future challenges. Livestock Production Science. Vol 80, p 41–53.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the level of infections by parasites in organically managed herds is generally higher than in conventional herds.&lt;ref&gt;Bennedsgaard, T.W. et al. 2003. Eleven years of organic dairy production in Denmark: herd health and production related to time of conversion and compared to conventional production. Livestock production science. Vol 80, p 121-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social aspects of dairy enterprises include life quality of farmers, of farm labor, of rural and urban communities, and also includes public health.

Both organic and non-organic farms can have good and bad implications for the [[life quality]] of all the different people involved in that [[food chain]]. Issues like labor conditions, labor hours and labor rights, for instance, do not depend on the organic/non-organic characteristic of the farm; they can be more related to the socio-economical and cultural situations in which the farm is inserted, instead.

As for the public health or [[food safety]] concern, [[organic foods]] are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary.

In an organic dairy farm, an agroecologist could evaluate the following:

# Can the farm minimize environmental impacts and increase its level of sustainability, for instance by efficiently increasing the [[productivity]] of the animals to minimize [[waste]] of feed and of land use?
# Are there ways to improve the [[animal health|health status]] of the herd (in the case of organics, by using [[biological pest control|biological controls]], for instance)?
# Does this way of farming sustain good [[quality of life]] for the [[farmer]]s, their families, [[farmworker|rural labor]] and communities involved?

===Views on no-till farming===

[[no-till farming|No-tillage]] is one of the components of [[conservation agriculture]] practices and is considered more environmental friendly than complete [[tillage]].&lt;ref name=Garcia-Torres&gt;Garcia-Torres, L. et al. 2002. Summary of the Workshop on Soil Protection and Sustainable Agriculture organized by the EU Commission DG Environment and the DG Environmental Quality of the Spanish Ministry of Environment (Soria, Spain)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Branco, H. and Lal, R. 2008. Principles of Conservation Management. No Tillage-Farming (Ch.8). Springer Verlag. Netherlands. P. 195&lt;/ref&gt; There is a general consensus that no-till can increase carbon content of topsoils, especially when combined with cover crops, but whether this improves the function of soils as a carbon sink is contested.&lt;ref name=Garcia-Torres/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolliger, A. et al. 2006. Taking stock of the Brazilian "Zero Till Revolution": A review of landmark research and farmers' practice. Adv. Agron. Vol 91, p 47–110&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Baker, J. M., Ochsner, T. E., Venterea, R. T., &amp; Griffis, T. J. (2007). Tillage and soil carbon sequestration—What do we really know?. Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment, 118(1-4), 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Powlson, D. S., Stirling, C. M., Jat, M. L., Gerard, B. G., Palm, C. A., Sanchez, P. A., &amp; Cassman, K. G. (2014). Limited potential of no-till agriculture for climate change mitigation. Nature Climate Change, 4(8), 678.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuel consumption-derived CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions under conventional and reduced tillage cropping systems in northern Japan. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment. Vol 99, p 213–219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most crops can benefit from the practice of no-till, but not all crops are suitable for complete no-till agriculture.&lt;ref name="Fleizo et al. 2002"&gt;Fleizo et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koller&gt;Koller, K. 2003. Techniques of soil tillage. Ed. Adel El Titi ([[CRC Press]])&lt;/ref&gt; Crops that do not perform well when competing with other plants that grow in untilled soil in their early stages can be best grown by using other conservation tillage practices, like a combination of [[strip-till]] with no-till areas.&lt;ref name=Koller/&gt; Also, crops which harvestable portion grows underground can have better results with strip-tillage,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} mainly in soils which are hard for plant roots to penetrate into deeper layers to access water and nutrients.

The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations,&lt;ref&gt;Pavuk, D.M. 1994. Influence of weeds within Zea mays crop plantings on populations of adult Diabrotica barberi and Diabrotica virgifera virgifera. Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment. Vol 50, p 165-175&lt;/ref&gt; which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Brust, B. Stinner &amp; D. McCartney. 1986. Predator activity and predation in corn agroecosystems. Environmental Entomology 15:1017-1021&lt;/ref&gt;

In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, G.W., and P.R. Hill. 2000. Fall strip-tillage systems. p. 193–199. In R.C. Reeder (ed.) Conservation tillage systems and management. MWPS-45, 2nd ed. Iowa State Univ., Ames.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Licht, M.A. and Al-Kaisi, M. 2005. Strip-tillage effect on seedbed soil temperature and other soil physical properties. Soil and Tillage Research. Vol 80, p 233-249&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to [[pathogen]]s, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds,&lt;!-- I thought tillage caused more weed problems than no-till? This is one of the main reasons no-tillage is practiced --&gt; it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for [[pest control]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, [[mulch-till]] and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.

In a no-till system, an agroecologist could&lt;!-- Would they ask these questions? Where did this section originate?--&gt; ask the following:

# Can the farm minimize environmental impacts and increase its level of sustainability; for instance by efficiently increasing the productivity of the crops to minimize land use?
# Does this way of farming sustain good quality of life for the farmers, their families, rural labor and [[communities|rural communities]] involved?

==History==

===Pre-WWII===
The notions and ideas relating to crop ecology have been around since at least 1911 when [[Franklin Hiram King|F.H. King]] released ''Farmers of Forty Centuries''. King was one of the pioneers as a proponent of more quantitative methods for characterization of water relations and physical properties of soils.&lt;ref name=francis&gt;{{cite journal |last=Francis |date=2003 |title=Agroecology: the ecology of food systems |journal=Journal of Sustainable Agriculture |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=99–118 |doi=10.1300/J064v22n03_10|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s the attempt to merge agronomy and ecology was born with the development of the field of crop ecology. Crop ecology's main concern was where crops would be best grown.&lt;ref name=gliess&gt;Gliessman, Stephen. R  Agroecology: Ecological Processes in Sustainable Agriculture. Ann Arbor: Sleeping Bear Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, it was only in 1928 that agronomy and ecology were formally linked by Klages.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klages, K.H.W. 1928. Crop ecology and ecological crop geography in the agronomic curriculum. J. Amer. Soc. Agron. 20:336-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention of the term agroecology was in 1928, with the publication of the term by Bensin in 1928.&lt;ref name=wezel/&gt; The book of Tischler (1965), was probably the first to be actually titled 'agroecology'.&lt;ref&gt;Tischler, W. (1965). Agrarökologie. Gustav Fischer Verlag, Jena, Germany, 499 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; He analysed the different components (plants, animals, soils and climate) and their interactions within an agroecosystem as well as the impact of human [[agricultural management]] on these components. Other books dealing with agroecology, but without using the term explicitly were published by the German zoologist Friederichs (1930) with his book on agricultural zoology and related ecological/environmental factors for plant protection,&lt;ref&gt;Friederichs, K. (1930) Die Grundfragen und Gesetzmäßigkeiten der land- und forstwirtschaftlichen Zoologie. Vol. 1: Ökologischer Teil, Vol. 2: Wirtschaftlicher Teil. Verlagsbuchhandlung Paul Parey, Berlin, Germany, 417 and 443 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and by American crop physiologist Hansen in 1939&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, B., Alrøe, H.F., Kristensen, E.S., 2001. Approaches to assess the [[environmental impact]] of [[organic agriculture|organic farming]] with particular regard to Denmark. Agric. Ecosys. Environ. 83, 11–26.&lt;/ref&gt; when both used the word as a synonym for the application of ecology within agriculture.&lt;ref name=dalgaard&gt;Dalgaard, Tommy, and Nicholas Hutchings, John Porter. "Agroecology, Scaling and Interdisciplinarity." Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment 100(2003): 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=This sentence seems self-contradictory. I.e., did they use the term or not?|date=July 2016}}

===Post-WWII===
Gliessman mentions that post-WWII, groups of scientists with ecologists gave more focus to experiments in the natural environment, while [[agronomist]]s dedicated their attention to the cultivated systems in agriculture.&lt;ref name=gliess/&gt; According to Gliessman,&lt;ref name=gliess/&gt; the two groups kept their research and interest apart until books and articles using the concept of agroecosystems and the word agroecology started to appear in 1970.&lt;ref name=wezel&gt;Wezel, A., Soldat, V. (2009). A quantitative and qualitative historical analysis of the scientific discipline agroecology. International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability 7 (1): 3-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dalgaard&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt; explains the different points of view in ecology schools, and the fundamental differences, which set the basis for the development of agroecology.  The early ecology school of [[Henry Gleason]] investigated plant populations focusing in the [[hierarchical]] levels of the organism under study.

Friederich Clement's ecology school, however included the organism in question as well as the higher hierarchical levels in its investigations, a "landscape perspective".  However, the ecological schools where the roots of agroecology lie are even broader in nature. The ecology school of [[Arthur Tansley|Tansley]],&lt;!--(1935)--&gt; whose view included both the biotic organism and their environment, is the one from which the concept of agroecosystems emerged in 1974 with Harper.&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harper, J.L., 1974. Agric. Ecosyst. Agroecosyst. 1, 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s the increasing awareness of how humans manage the landscape and its consequences set the stage for the necessary cross between agronomy and ecology. Even though, in many ways the [[environmental movement]] in the US was a product of the times, the  {{clarify|text=Green Decade,|date=July 2016}} spread an environmental awareness of the [[unintended consequence]]s of changing ecological processes. Works such as ''[[Silent Spring]]'', and  ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'', and  changes in legislation such as the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], [[Clean Water Act]], and the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] caused the public to be aware of societal growth patterns, agricultural production, and the overall capacity of the system.&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt;

===Fusion with ecology===
After the 1970s, when agronomists saw the value of ecology and ecologists began to use the agricultural systems as study plots, studies in agroecology grew more rapidly.&lt;ref name=gliess/&gt; Gliessman describes that the innovative work of Prof. Efraim Hernandez X., who developed research based on [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous systems of knowledge]] in [[Mexico]], led to education programs in agroecology.&lt;ref name=qFran&gt;qtd. in Francis ''et al.'' 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 Prof. Efraim Hernandez X. explained that modern agricultural systems had lost their ecological foundation when [[socio-economic]] factors became the only driving force in the [[food system]].&lt;ref name=francis/&gt; The acknowledgement that the socio-economic interactions are indeed one of the fundamental components of any agroecosystems came to light in 1982, with the article Agroecologia del Tropico Americano by Montaldo. The author argues that the socio-economic context cannot be separated from the agricultural systems when designing agricultural practices.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;

In 1995 Edens et al. in Sustainable Agriculture and Integrated Farming Systems solidified this idea proving his point by devoting special sections to economics of the systems, ecological impacts, and ethics and values in agriculture.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt; Actually, 1985 ended up being a fertile and creative year for the new discipline. For instance in the same year, [[Miguel Altieri]] integrated how consolidation of the farms, and cropping systems impact pest populations. In addition, Gliessman highlighted that socio-economic, technological, and ecological components give rise to producer choices of food production systems.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt; These pioneering agroecologists have helped to frame the foundation of what we today consider the interdisciplinary field of agroecology and have led to advances in a number of farming systems. In Asian rice, for example, crop diversification by growing flowering crops in strips beside rice fields has recently been demonstrated to reduce pests so effectively (by the flower nectar attracting and supporting parasitoids and predators) that insecticide spraying is reduced by 70%, yields increase by 5%, together resulting in an economic advantage of 7.5% [http://www.nature.com/articles/nplants201614 (Gurr et al., 2016)].

== By region ==

The principles of agroecology are expressed differently depending on local ecological and social contexts.

=== Latin America ===

{{Main article|Agroecology in Latin America}}
Latin America's experiences with North American Green Revolution agricultural techniques have opened space for agroecologists.  Traditional or [[indigenous knowledge]] represents a wealth of possibility for agroecologists, including "exchange of wisdoms".  See Miguel Alteiri's ''Enhancing the Productivity of Latin American Traditional Peasant Farming Systems Through an Agroecological Approach'' for information on agroecology in Latin America.

Agroecological techniques and knowledge played an important role in solving the severe food crisis in [[Cuba]] following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Funes |first1=Fernando |last2=García |first2=Luis |last3=Bourque |first3=Martin |last4=Pérez |first4=Nilda |last5=Rosset |first5=Peter |title=Sustainable Agriculture and Resistance: Transforming Food Production in Cuba |location= Oakland, CA |publisher=Food First Books |isbn=0-935028-87-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of Cuba's urban agricultural movement, agroecology is integral to production in Cuban [[organopónico|organopónicos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10460-015-9659-y |title=Low-carbon food supply: The ecological geography of Cuban urban agriculture and agroecological theory |journal=Agriculture and Human Values |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=771–784 |year=2016 |last1=Cederlöf |first1=Gustav }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===

Historically, agroecology has had low traction in Africa, as governments, international organisations, extension services and farmers' organisations tended to focus on issues of inputs and outputs as the defining factors to deal with recurrent food crises and chronic malnutrition in the continent. Agrocecology was only a minor proposal from a few, non-governmental, small-scale projects and a sort of "experimental" idea of the Farmer Field Schools programme.

In the early 2000s, when the AIDS pandemic was creating a major rural crisis across Africa, Josep Garí proposed FAO to consider an agroecological approach as the most effective way to empower farmers cope with the impacts of the AIDS pandemic on agriculture and food production: in particular, he proposed agro-biodiversity as a key resource and knowledge for farmers to address the labour and malnutrition crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2003). Agrobiodiversity strategies to combat food insecurity and HIV/AIDS impact in rural Africa. FAO / Population and Development Service, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was rapidly adopted by the Farmer Field Schools scheme across the world, and even presented and translated in China.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2004). Plant diversity, sustainable rural livelihoods and the HIV/AIDS crisis. Bangkok: UNDP &amp; FAO, 2004. Published in English and Chinese. {{ISBN|974-92021-4-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, agroecology has started to permeate projects and discourses on farming and natural-resource management in Africa. In 2011, the 1st encounter of agroecology trainers took place in Zimbabwe and issued the Shashe Declaration.

=== Madagascar ===
{{Main article|Agroecology in Madagascar}}
Most of the historical farming in Madagascar has been conducted by indigenous peoples.  The French [[Colonialism|colonial]] period disturbed a very small percentage of land area, and even included some useful experiments in [[Sustainable forestry]]. [[Slash-and-burn]] techniques, a component of some [[shifting cultivation]] systems have been practised by natives in Madagascar for centuries.  As of 2006 some of the major agricultural products from slash-and-burn methods are wood, charcoal and grass for [[Zebu]] grazing.  These practices have taken perhaps the greatest toll on land fertility since the end of French rule, mainly due to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures.

'''Altruism''' (also called the '''ethic of altruism''', '''moralistic altruism''', and '''ethical altruism''') is an [[ethics|ethical doctrine]] that holds that the [[morality|moral]] value of an individual's actions depend solely on the impact on other individuals, regardless of the consequences on the individual itself. [[James Fieser]] states the altruist dictum as: "An action is morally right if the consequences of that action are more favorable than unfavorable to everyone except the agent."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Auguste Comte]]'s version of altruism calls for living for the sake of others. One who holds to either of these ethics is known as an "altruist."

The word "altruism" (''French, altruisme, from autrui: "other people", derived from Latin alter: "other"'') was coined by [[Auguste Comte]], the French founder of [[positivism]], in order to describe the ethical doctrine he supported. He believed that individuals had a [[moral obligation]] to renounce self-interest and live for others. Comte says, in his ''Catéchisme Positiviste'',&lt;ref name="comte"&gt;[[Auguste Comte|Comte, August]]. ''Catéchisme positiviste'' (1852) or ''Catechism of Positivism'', trans. R. Congreve, (London: Kegan Paul, 1891)&lt;/ref&gt; that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The] social point of view cannot tolerate the notion of rights, for such notion rests on individualism. We are born under a load of obligations of every kind, to our predecessors, to our successors, to our contemporaries. After our birth these obligations increase or accumulate, for it is some time before we can return any service.... This ["to live for others"], the definitive formula of human morality, gives a direct sanction exclusively to our instincts of benevolence, the common source of happiness and duty. [Man must serve] Humanity, whose we are entirely."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' says that for Comte's altruism, "The first principle of morality...is the regulative supremacy of social sympathy over the self-regarding instincts."&lt;ref name="catholicencyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01369a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia entry on altruism'']&lt;/ref&gt; Author Gabriel Moran, (professor in the department of Humanities and the Social Sciences, New York University) says "The law and duty of life in altruism [for Comte] was summed up in the phrase : Live for others."&lt;ref name="moran"&gt;Gabriel Moran ''Christian Religion and National Interests''&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[philosophers]] define the doctrine in various ways, but all definitions generally revolve around a moral obligation to benefit others or the pronouncement of moral value in serving others rather than oneself. Philosopher [[C. D. Broad]] defines altruism as "the doctrine that each of us has a special obligation to benefit others."&lt;ref name="cheney"&gt;Cheney, D. R. (Editor), ''Broad's critical essays in moral philosophy'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;283–301). London: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher W. G. Maclagan defines it as "a duty to relieve the distress and promote the happiness of our fellows...Altruism is to...maintain quite simply that a man may and should discount altogether his own pleasure or happiness as such when he is deciding what course of action to pursue."&lt;ref name="maclagan"&gt;''Self and Others: A Defense of Altruism'' Philosophical Quarterly 4 (1954): pp 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As consequentialist ethics==
Altruism is often seen as a form of [[consequentialism]], as it indicates that an action is ethically right if it brings good consequences to others. Altruism may be seen as similar to [[utilitarianism]], however an essential difference is that the latter prescribes acts that maximize good consequences for all of society, while altruism prescribes maximizing good consequences for everyone except the actor. Spencer argued that since the rest of society will almost always outnumber the utilitarian, a genuine utilitarian will inevitably end up practicing altruism or a form of altruism.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Ethics'' §85ff&lt;/ref&gt; [[Effective altruism]] is a philosophy and social movement that maintains that the consequences of our actions - for ourselves and others - are important, and seeks to maximise the overall quality of these consequences.

==Criticisms==
[[David Kelley]], discussing [[Ayn Rand]]'s views, says that "there is no rational ground for asserting that sacrificing yourself in order to serve others is morally superior to pursuing your own (long-term, rational) self-interest. Altruism ultimately depends on non-rational 'rationales,' on mysticism in some form..." Furthermore, he holds that there is a danger of the state enforcing that moral ideal: "If self-sacrifice is an ideal - if service to others is the highest, most honorable course of action - why not force people to act accordingly?" He believes this can ultimately result in the state forcing everyone into a [[collectivist]] political system.&lt;ref name="kelley"&gt;Kelley, David. https://atlassociety.org/commentary/commentary-blog/3666-epistemology-and-politics-ayn-rand-s-cultural-commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

Norwegian eco-philosopher [[Arne Næss]] argues that environmental action based upon altruism — or service of the other — stems from a shrunken "egoic" concept of the self.  Self-actualization will result, he argues, in the recovery of an "[[ecological self]]", in which actions formerly seen as altruistic are in reality a form of [[enlightened self-interest]].&lt;ref name="seed"&gt;Seed, John, Macy, Joanna, Naess, Arne, &amp; Fleming, Pat (1988). "Thinking Like a Mountain: Towards a Council of All Beings" (New Society Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

German philosopher [[Max Scheler]] distinguishes two different ways in which the strong can help the weak, one which is an expression of love, "motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one’s own life and existence"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scheler | first = Max | coauthors = | title = Ressentiment | year = 1961  | pages = 88–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another which is merely "one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people’s business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scheler | first = Max | coauthors = | title = Ressentiment | year = 1961  | pages = 95–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At its worst, Scheler says, "love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scheler | first = Max | coauthors = | title = Ressentiment | year = 1961  | pages = 96–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Braden R. Allenby''' (born  1950) is an American [[environmental scientist]], environmental [[Lawyer|attorney]] and  Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and of Law, at [[Arizona State University]].

== Biography ==
Dr. Allenby was born in Highland Park, Illinois December 29, 1950 to Dr. Richard J. Allenby, jr.(1923-2017) and Julia T. Allenby(1925–2002).  He is the oldest of three brothers, Dr. Kent Allenby(1952-   ) and Peter Allenby(1957-    ).
Allenby graduated cum laude from [[Yale University]] in 1972, received his Juris Doctor from the [[University of Virginia]] Law School in 1978, his Masters in Economics from the [[University of Virginia]] in 1979, his Masters in [[Environmental Sciences]] from [[Rutgers University]] in the Spring of 1989, and his Ph.D. in Environmental Sciences from [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] in 1992.

He joined [[AT&amp;T]] in 1983 as a telecommunications regulatory attorney, and was an environmental attorney and Senior Environmental Attorney for AT&amp;T from 1984 to 1993. From 1991 to 1992 he was the J. Herbert Holloman Fellow at the National Academy of Engineering in Washington, DC. His areas of expertise include Design for Environment, industrial ecology, telework and netcentric organizations, and [[earth systems engineering and management]]. During 1992, he was the J. Herbert Holloman Fellow at the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in Washington, DC. From 1995 to 1997 he was Director for Energy and Environmental Systems at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], on temporary assignment from his position as Research Vice President, Technology and Environment, for [[AT&amp;T]]. In June, 2000, he chaired the second Gordon Conference on [[Industrial Ecology]].

In 2007 he is President of the International Society for Industrial Ecology; Chair of the AAAS Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy; a Batten Fellow in Residence at the University of Virginia's [[Darden Graduate School of Business Administration]]; 
He is a member of the Virginia Bar, and has worked as an attorney for the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] and the [[Federal Communications Commission]], as well as a strategic consultant on economic and technical telecommunications issues.  He is a Fellow of the Royal Society for the Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce. He is currently a former member of different boards.

== Work ==
His areas of all expertise include: [[design for environment]], [[earth systems engineering and management]], [[industrial ecology]], NBIC (i.e., nanotechnology, biotechnology, information and communication technology, and cognitive science), convergence and technological evolution.

He has taught courses on [[industrial ecology]] and [[design for environment]] at the [[Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies|Yale University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies]] and at the University of Wisconsin Engineering Extension School; and has lectured widely on [[earth systems engineering and management]], [[industrial ecology]], and [[design for Environment]].

Allenby has authored a number of articles and book chapters on his above mentioned interests, and writes a column for the Journal of Industrial Ecology.

A '''conceptual model''' is a representation of a system, made of the composition of [[concept]]s which are used to help people [[knowledge|know]], [[understanding|understand]], or [[simulation|simulate]] a subject the model represents. It is also a set of concepts. Some [[physical model|models]] are [[physical object]]s; for example, a toy model which may be assembled, and may be made to work like the object it represents.

The term ''conceptual model'' may be used to refer to models which are formed after a [[wikt:concept#Noun|conceptualization]] or [[generalization]] process.&lt;ref name="MWCD"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptual models are often abstractions of things in the real world whether physical or social. [[Semantics|Semantic]] studies are relevant to various stages of concept formation. Semantics is basically about concepts, the meaning that thinking beings give to various elements of their experience.

== Overview ==
=== Models of concepts and models that are conceptual ===
The term ''conceptual model'' is normal. It could mean "a model of concept" or it could mean "a model that is conceptual." A distinction can be made between ''what models are'' and ''what models are made of''. With the exception of iconic models, such as a scale model of [[Winchester Cathedral]], most models are concepts. But they are, mostly, intended to be models of real world states of affairs. The value of a model is usually directly proportional to how well it corresponds to a past, present, future, actual or potential state of affairs. A model of a concept is quite different because in order to be a good model it need not have this real world correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Frank Hutson (January 1992) [http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Cause,_Effect,_Efficiency_%26_Soft_Systems_Models Cause, Effect, Efficiency &amp; Soft Systems Models] Warwick Business School Research Paper No. 42. With revisions and additions it was published in the ''Journal of the Operational Research Society'' (1993) 44(4), pp. 149–68.&lt;/ref&gt; In artificial intelligence conceptual models and [[conceptual graphs]] are used for building [[expert systems]] and [[knowledge-based systems]]; here the analysts are concerned to represent expert opinion on what is true not their own ideas on what is true.

=== Type and scope of conceptual models ===
Conceptual models (models that are conceptual) range in type from the more concrete, such as the [[mental image]] of a familiar physical object, to the formal generality and abstractness of [[mathematical model]]s which do not appear to the mind as an image. Conceptual models also range in terms of the scope of the subject matter that they are taken to represent. A model may, for instance, represent a single thing (e.g. the ''Statue of Liberty''), whole classes of things (e.g. ''the electron''), and even very vast domains of subject matter such as ''the physical universe.'' The variety and scope of conceptual models is due to then variety of purposes had by the people using them.
Conceptual modeling is the activity of formally describing some aspects of the physical and social world around us for the purposes of understanding and communication."&lt;ref name="Mylopoulos"&gt;{{cite book | first =  J. | last = Mylopoulos | author-link=John Mylopoulos|chapter = Conceptual modeling and Telos1 | editor1-first = P. | editor1-last = Loucopoulos | editor2-first = R | editor2-last = Zicari | title = Conceptual Modeling, Databases, and Case An integrated view of information systems development | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | citeseerx = 10.1.1.83.3647 | pages = 49–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fundamental objectives ===
A conceptual model's primary objective is to convey the fundamental principles and basic functionality of the system which it represents. Also, a conceptual model must be developed in such a way as to provide an easily understood system interpretation for the models users. A conceptual model, when implemented properly, should satisfy four fundamental objectives.&lt;ref name="Kung and Solveberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=20143.20149 |title=C.H. Kung, A. Solvberg, Activity Modeling and Behavior Modeling, In: T. Ollie, H. Sol, A. Verrjin-Stuart, Proceedings of the IFIP WG 8.1 working conference on comparative review of information systems design methodologies: improving the practice. North-Holland, Amsterdam (1986), pp. 145–71 |publisher=Portal.acm.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Enhance an individual's understanding of the representative system
# Facilitate efficient conveyance of system details between stakeholders
# Provide a point of reference for system designers to extract system specifications
# Document the system for future reference and provide a means for collaboration

The conceptual model plays an important role in the overall system development life cycle. Figure 1&lt;ref name="Sokolowski"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Sokolowski |editor1-first=John A. |editor2-last=Banks |editor2-first=Catherine M. |date=2010 |title=Modeling and Simulation Fundamentals: Theoretical Underpinnings and Practical Domains |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=9780470486740 |oclc=436945978 |doi=10.1002/9780470590621}}&lt;/ref&gt; below, depicts the role of the conceptual model in a typical system development scheme. It is clear that if the conceptual model is not fully developed, the execution of fundamental system properties may not be implemented properly, giving way to future problems or system shortfalls. These failures do occur in the industry and have been linked to; lack of user input, incomplete or unclear requirements, and changing requirements. Those weak links in the system design and development process can be traced to improper execution of the fundamental objectives of conceptual modeling. The importance of conceptual modeling is evident when such systemic failures are mitigated by thorough system development and adherence to proven development objectives/techniques.

== Modelling techniques ==
{{Main article|Conceptual model (computer science)}}

As systems have become increasingly complex, the role of conceptual modelling has dramatically expanded. With that expanded presence, the effectiveness of conceptual modeling at capturing the fundamentals of a system is being realized. Building on that realization, numerous conceptual modeling techniques have been created. These techniques can be applied across multiple disciplines to increase the users understanding of the system to be modeled.&lt;ref name="Science Direct"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TYX-4GPVP8P-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2006&amp;_alid=1566452383&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_zone=rslt_list_item&amp;_cdi=5630&amp;_sort=r&amp;_st=13&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=9090&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=d8982c2440adcdec4575f8d0e0e4432f&amp;searchtype=a I. Davies, P. Green, M. Rosemann, M. Indulska, S. Gallo, How do practitioners use conceptual modeling in practice?, Elsevier, Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering 58 (2006) pp.358–80]&lt;/ref&gt; A few techniques are briefly described in the following text, however, many more exist or are being developed. Some commonly used conceptual modeling techniques and methods include: [[workflow]] modeling, [[workforce modeling]], [[rapid application development]], [[object-role modeling]], and the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML).

=== Data flow modeling ===

Data flow modeling (DFM) is a basic conceptual modeling technique that graphically represents elements of a system. DFM is a fairly simple technique, however, like many conceptual modeling techniques, it is possible to construct higher and lower level representative diagrams. The [[data flow diagram]] usually does not convey complex system details such as parallel development considerations or timing information, but rather works to bring the major system functions into context. Data flow modeling is a central technique used in systems development that utilizes the [[structured systems analysis and design method]] (SSADM).

=== Entity relationship modeling (Ontology oriented) ===

[[Entity-relationship model]]ing (ERM) is a conceptual modeling technique used primarily for software system representation. Entity-relationship diagrams, which are a product of executing the ERM technique, are normally used to represent database models and information systems. The main components of the diagram are the entities and relationships. The entities can represent independent functions, objects, or events. The relationships are responsible for relating the entities to one another. To form a system process, the relationships are combined with the entities and any attributes needed to further describe the process. Multiple diagramming conventions exist for this technique; [[IDEF1X]], [[Bachman diagram|Bachman]], and [[EXPRESS (data modeling language)|EXPRESS]], to name a few. These conventions are just different ways of viewing and organizing the data to represent different system aspects.

=== Event-driven process chain ===

The [[event-driven process chain]] (EPC) is a conceptual modeling technique which is mainly used to systematically improve business process flows. Like most conceptual modeling techniques, the event driven process chain consists of entities/elements and functions that allow relationships to be developed and processed. More specifically, the EPC is made up of events which define what state a process is in or the rules by which it operates. In order to progress through events, a function/ active event must be executed. Depending on the process flow, the function has the ability to transform event states or link to other event driven process chains. Other elements exist within an EPC, all of which work together to define how and by what rules the system operates. The EPC technique can be applied to business practices such as resource planning, process improvement, and logistics.

=== Joint application development ===

The [[dynamic systems development method]] uses a specific process called JEFFF to conceptually model a systems life cycle. JEFFF is intended to focus more on the higher level development planning that precedes a projects initialization. The JAD process calls for a series of workshops in which the participants work to identify, define, and generally map a successful project from conception to completion. This method has been found to not work well for large scale applications, however smaller applications usually report some net gain in efficiency.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = E. J. | title = Joint application design (JAD) in practice | doi = 10.1016/S0164-1212(98)10080-8 | journal = Journal of Systems and Software | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 215–23 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Place/transition net ===

Also known as [[Petri net]]s, this conceptual modeling technique allows a system to be constructed with elements that can be described by direct mathematical means. The petri net, because of its nondeterministic execution properties and well defined mathematical theory, is a useful technique for modeling [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent system behavior]], i.e. simultaneous process executions.

=== State transition modeling ===

State transition modeling makes use of [[state transition diagram]]s to describe system behavior. These state transition diagrams use distinct states to define system behavior and changes. Most current modeling tools contain some kind of ability to represent state transition modeling. The use of state transition models can be most easily recognized as logic state diagrams and directed graphs for [[finite-state machine]]s.

=== Technique evaluation and selection ===
Because the conceptual modeling method can sometimes be purposefully vague to account for a broad area of use, the actual application of concept modeling can become difficult. To alleviate this issue, and shed some light on what to consider when selecting an appropriate conceptual modeling technique, the framework proposed by Gemino and Wand will be discussed in the following text. However, before evaluating the effectiveness of a conceptual modeling technique for a particular application, an important concept must be understood; Comparing conceptual models by way of specifically focusing on their graphical or top level representations is shortsighted. Gemino and Wand make a good point when arguing that the emphasis should be placed on a conceptual [[modeling language]] when choosing an appropriate technique. In general, a conceptual model is developed using some form of conceptual modeling technique. That technique will utilize a conceptual modeling language that determines the rules for how the model is arrived at. Understanding the capabilities of the specific language used is inherent to properly evaluating a conceptual modeling technique, as the language reflects the techniques descriptive ability. Also, the conceptual modeling language will directly influence the depth at which the system is capable of being represented, whether it be complex or simple.&lt;ref name="Gemino and Wand"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gemino | first1 = A. | last2 = Wand | first2 = Y. | doi = 10.1007/s00766-004-0204-6 | title = A framework for empirical evaluation of conceptual modeling techniques | journal = Requirements Engineering | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 248–60 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on some of their earlier work,&lt;ref name="early Gemino and Wand"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gemino | first1 = A. | last2 = Wand | first2 = Y. | doi = 10.1145/944217.944243 | title = Evaluating modeling techniques based on models of learning | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 46 | issue = 10 | pages = 79–84 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gemino and Wand acknowledge some main points to consider when studying the affecting factors: the content that the conceptual model must represent, the method in which the model will be presented, the characteristics of the models users, and the conceptual model languages specific task.&lt;ref name="Gemino and Wand" /&gt; The conceptual models content should be considered in order to select a technique that would allow relevant information to be presented. The presentation method for selection purposes would focus on the techniques ability to represent the model at the intended level of depth and detail. The characteristics of the models users or participants is an important aspect to consider. A participant's background and experience should coincide with the conceptual models complexity, else misrepresentation of the system or misunderstanding of key system concepts could lead to problems in that systems realization. The conceptual model language task will further allow an appropriate technique to be chosen. The difference between creating a system conceptual model to convey system functionality and creating a system conceptual model to interpret that functionality could involve to completely different types of conceptual modeling languages.

==== Considering affected variables ====

Gemino and Wand go on to expand the affected variable content of their proposed framework by considering the focus of observation and the criterion for comparison.&lt;ref name="Gemino and Wand" /&gt; The focus of observation considers whether the conceptual modeling technique will create a "new product", or whether the technique will only bring about a more intimate understanding of the system being modeled. The criterion for comparison would weigh the ability of the conceptual modeling technique to be efficient or effective. A conceptual modeling technique that allows for development of a [[system model]] which takes all system variables into account at a high level may make the process of understanding the system functionality more efficient, but the technique lacks the necessary information to explain the internal processes, rendering the model less effective.

When deciding which conceptual technique to use, the recommendations of Gemino and Wand can be applied in order to properly evaluate the scope of the conceptual model in question. Understanding the conceptual models scope will lead to a more informed selection of a technique that properly addresses that particular model. In summary, when deciding between modeling techniques, answering the following questions would allow one to address some important conceptual modeling considerations.

# What content will the conceptual model represent?
# How will the conceptual model be presented?
# Who will be using or participating in the conceptual model?
# How will the conceptual model describe the system?
# What is the conceptual models focus of observation?
# Will the conceptual model be efficient or effective in describing the system?

Another function of the simulation conceptual model is to provide a rational and factual basis for assessment of simulation application appropriateness.

==Models in philosophy and science==

=== Mental model ===
{{Further information|Mental model|Representation (psychology)|Cognitive model}}
In cognitive psychology and philosophy of mind, a mental model is a representation of something in the mind,&lt;ref&gt;Mental Representation:The Computational Theory of Mind, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-representation/]&lt;/ref&gt; but a [[mental model]] may also refer to a nonphysical external model of the mind itself.&lt;ref&gt;Mental Models and Usability, Depaul University, Cognitive Psychology 404, Nov, 15, 1999, Mary Jo Davidson, Laura Dove, Julie Weltz, [http://www.lauradove.info/reports/mental%20models.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysical models ===
A metaphysical model is a type of conceptual model which is distinguished from other conceptual models by its proposed scope; a metaphysical model intends to represent reality in the broadest possible way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Slater |editor1-first=Matthew H. |editor2-last=Yudell |editor2-first=Zanja |date=2017 |title=Metaphysics and the Philosophy of Science: New Essays |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780199363209 |oclc=956947667 |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is to say that it [[explanation|explains]] the answers to fundamental questions such as whether [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] and [[mind]] are one or two [[Physical substance|substance]]s; or whether or not humans have [[free will]].

=== Conceptual model vs. semantics model ===
{{confusing|section|reason=the poor English might have a lot to do with it, but it is very hard to define even the basic idea of what the difference is between conceptual and semantic modelling. An example might help|date=October 2014}}

=== Epistemological models ===
An epistemological model is a type of conceptual model whose proposed scope is the [[knowledge|known]] and the knowable, and the [[belief|believed]] and the believable.

=== Logical models ===
In [[logic]], a model is a type of [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] under which a particular statement is true. Logical models can be broadly divided into ones which only attempt to represent concepts, such as mathematical models; and ones which attempt to represent physical objects, and factual relationships, among which are scientific models.

[[Model theory]] is the study of (classes of) mathematical structures such as groups, fields, graphs, or even universes of set theory, using tools from mathematical logic. A system that gives meaning to the sentences of a formal language is called a model for the language. If a model for a language moreover satisfies a particular sentence or theory (set of sentences), it is called a model of the sentence or theory. Model theory has close ties to algebra and universal algebra.

=== Mathematical models ===
{{Main article|Mathematical model}}

Mathematical models can take many forms, including but not limited to dynamical systems, statistical models, differential equations, or game theoretic models. These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures.

A more comprehensive type of mathematical model&lt;ref&gt;DI Spivak, RE Kent. "Ologs: a category-theoretic approach to knowledge representation" (2011). PLoS ONE (in press): e24274. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0024274}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses a linguistic version of [[category theory]] to model a given situation.  Akin to [[entity-relationship models]], custom [[category (mathematics)|categories]] or [[sketch (mathematics)|sketches]] can be directly translated into [[database schema]]s. The difference is that logic is replaced by category theory, which brings powerful theorems to bear on the subject of modeling, especially useful for translating between disparate models (as functors between categories).

=== Scientific models ===
{{Main article|Scientific modelling}}

A scientific model is a simplified abstract view of a complex reality. A scientific model represents [[empiricism|empirical]] objects, phenomena, and physical processes in a [[logic]]al way.  Attempts to [[formal language|formalize]] the [[laws of science|principle]]s of the [[empirical science]]s use an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] to model reality, in the same way logicians [[axiomatic system|axiomatize]] the [[rule of inference|principle]]s of [[logic]]. The aim of these attempts is to construct a [[formal system]] for which [[reality]] is the only interpretation.  The world is an interpretation (or model) of these sciences, only insofar as these sciences are true.&lt;ref name="tcarotmimanass"&gt;edited by Hans Freudenthal (1951), ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=8083fb2EuAMC&amp;dq=The+Concept+and+the+Role+of+the+Model+in+Mathematics+and+Natural+and+Social+Sciences&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bF9aEC4e6L&amp;sig=iduhMF0ektNGV87_ZkwuY5thw0U#PPA8,M1 The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social Sciences]'', pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistical models ==
{{Further information|Statistical model|Parametric model|Nonparametric statistics|Model selection}}
A statistical model is a [[probability distribution function]] proposed as generating data. In a [[parametric model]], the probability distribution function has variable parameters, such as the [[mean]] and [[variance]] in a [[normal distribution]], or the [[coefficients]] for the various [[exponent]]s of the [[independent variable]] in [[linear regression]]. A [[nonparametric statistics|nonparametric model]] has a distribution function without parameters, such as in [[bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]], and is only loosely confined by assumptions. [[Model selection]] is a statistical method for selecting a distribution function within a class of them; e.g., in linear regression where the dependent variable is a polynomial of the independent variable with parametric coefficients, model selection is selecting the highest exponent, and may be done with nonparametric means, such as with [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross validation]].

In statistics there can be models of mental events as well as models of physical events. For example, a statistical model of customer behavior is a model that is conceptual (because behavior is physical),  but a statistical model of customer satisfaction is a model of a concept (because satisfaction is a mental not a physical event).

== Social and political models ==

=== Economic models ===
{{Main article|Economic model}}
In [[economics]], a model is a theoretical construct that represents economic processes by a set of variables and a set of logical and/or quantitative relationships between them. The economic model is a simplified framework designed to illustrate complex processes, often but not always using mathematical techniques. Frequently, economic models use structural parameters. Structural parameters are underlying parameters in a model or class of models.  A model may have various parameters and those parameters may change to create various properties.

== Models in systems architecture ==
{{Main article|System model}}
A system model is the conceptual model that describes and represents the structure, behavior, and more [[View model|views]] of a [[system]]. A system model can represent [[View model|multiple views]] of a system by using two different approaches. The first one is the non-architectural approach and the second one is the architectural approach. The non-architectural approach respectively picks a model for each view. The architectural approach, also known as [[system architecture]], instead of picking many heterogeneous and unrelated models, will use only one integrated architectural model.

===Business process modelling===
{{Main article|Business process modeling}}
[[File:Meta-levels.svg|thumb|right|300px|Abstraction for Business process modelling&lt;ref&gt;[[Colette Rolland]] (1993). "Modeling the Requirements Engineering Process." in: ''3rd European-Japanese Seminar on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases, [[Budapest, Hungary]]'', June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In business process modelling the enterprise process model is often referred to as the ''business process model''. Process models are core concepts in the discipline of process engineering. Process models are:
* Processes of the same nature that are classified together into a model.
* A description of a process at the type level.
* Since the process model is at the type level, a process is an instantiation of it.
The same process model is used repeatedly for the development of many applications and thus, has many instantiations.

One possible use of a process model is to prescribe how things must/should/could be done in contrast to the process itself which is really what happens. A process model is roughly an anticipation of what the process will look like. What the process shall be will be determined during actual system development.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Rolland]] and C. Thanos Pernici (1998). "A Comprehensive View of Process Engineering". In: ''Proceedings of the 10th International Conference CAiSE'98, B. Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1413'', [[Pisa, Italy]], Springer, June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models in information system design==

=== Conceptual models of human activity systems ===
{{Main article|Soft systems methodology}}
Conceptual models of human activity systems are used in soft systems methodology (SSM), which is a method of systems analysis concerned with the [[Problem structuring methods|structuring of problems]] in management. These models are models of concepts; the authors specifically state that they are not intended to represent a state of affairs in the physical world. They are also used in information [[requirements analysis]] (IRA) which is a variant of SSM developed for information system design and software engineering.

=== Logico-linguistic models ===
{{Main article|Logico-linguistic modeling}}
Logico-linguistic modeling is another variant of SSM that uses conceptual models. However, this method combines models of concepts with models of putative real world objects and events. It is a graphical representation of modal logic in which modal operators are used to distinguish statement about concepts from statements about real world objects and events.

=== Data models ===

==== Entity-relationship model ====
{{Main article|Entity-relationship model}}
In software engineering, an entity-relationship model (ERM) is an abstract and conceptual representation of data. Entity-relationship modeling is a database modeling method, used to produce a type of conceptual schema or semantic data model of a system, often a relational database, and its requirements in a top-down fashion. Diagrams created by this process are called entity-relationship diagrams, ER diagrams, or ERDs.

Entity-relationship models have had wide application in the building of information systems intended to support activities involving objects and events in the real world. In these cases they are models that are conceptual. However, this modeling method can be used to build computer games or a family tree of the Greek Gods, in these cases it would be used to model concepts.

==== Domain model ====
{{Main article|Domain model}}
A domain model is a type of conceptual model used to depict the structural elements and their conceptual constraints within a domain of interest (sometimes called the [[problem domain]]). A domain model includes the various entities, their attributes and relationships, plus the constraints governing the conceptual integrity of the structural model elements comprising that problem domain. A domain model may also include a number of conceptual views, where each view is pertinent to a particular subject area of the domain or to a particular subset of the domain model which is of interest to a stakeholder of the domain model.

Like entity-relationship models, domain models can be used to model concepts or to model real world objects and events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11259">In mathematics, a '''concrete category''' is a [[category (category theory)|category]] that is equipped with a [[faithful functor]] to the [[category of sets]] (or sometimes to another category, ''see [[#Relative concreteness|Relative concreteness]] below''). This functor makes it possible to think of the objects of the category as sets with additional [[mathematical structure|structure]], and of its [[morphism]]s as structure-preserving functions. Many important categories have obvious interpretations as concrete categories, for example the [[category of topological spaces]] and the [[category of groups]], and trivially also the category of sets itself. On the other hand, the [[homotopy category of topological spaces]] is not '''concretizable''', i.e. it does not admit a faithful functor to the category of sets.

A concrete category, when defined without reference to the notion of a category, consists of a [[class (set theory)|class]] of ''objects'', each equipped with an ''underlying set''; and for any two objects ''A'' and ''B'' a set of functions, called ''morphisms'', from the underlying set of ''A'' to the underlying set of ''B''. Furthermore, for every object ''A'', the identity function on the underlying set of ''A'' must be a morphism from ''A'' to ''A'', and the composition of a morphism from ''A'' to ''B'' followed by a morphism from ''B'' to ''C'' must be a morphism from ''A'' to ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Mac Lane | first1=Saunders | author1-link=Saunders Mac Lane | last2=Birkhoff | first2=Garrett | author2-link=Garrett Birkhoff | title=Algebra | publisher=AMS Chelsea | edition=3rd | isbn=978-0-8218-1646-2 | year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

A '''concrete category''' is a pair (''C'',''U'') such that

*''C'' is a category, and 
*''U'' : ''C'' → '''Set''' (the category of sets and functions) is a [[faithful functor]].

The functor ''U'' is to be thought of as a [[forgetful functor]], which assigns to every object of ''C'' its "underlying set", and to every morphism in ''C'' its "underlying function".

A category ''C'' is '''concretizable''' if there exists a concrete category (''C'',''U'');
i.e., if there exists a faithful functor ''U'':''C'' → '''Set'''.  All small categories are concretizable: define ''U'' so that its object part maps each object ''b'' of ''C'' to the set of all morphisms of ''C'' whose [[codomain]] is ''b'' (i.e. all morphisms of the form ''f'': ''a'' → ''b'' for any object ''a'' of ''C''), and its morphism part maps each morphism ''g'': ''b'' → ''c'' of ''C'' to the function ''U''(''g''): ''U''(''b'') → ''U''(''c'') which maps each member ''f'': ''a'' → ''b'' of ''U''(''b'') to the composition ''gf'': ''a'' → ''c'', a member of ''U''(''c'').  (Item 6 under [[concrete category#Further examples|Further examples]] expresses the same ''U'' in less elementary language via presheaves.)  The [[concrete category#Counter-examples|Counter-examples]] section exhibits two large categories that are not concretizable.

== Remarks ==

It is important to note that, contrary to intuition, concreteness is not a [[property (philosophy)|property]] which a category may or may not satisfy, but rather a structure with which a category may or may not be equipped.  In particular, a category ''C'' may admit several faithful functors into '''Set'''.  Hence there may be several concrete categories (''C'',''U'') all corresponding to the same category ''C''.

In practice, however, the choice of faithful functor is often clear and in this case we simply speak of the "concrete category ''C''".  For example, "the concrete category '''Set'''" means the pair ('''Set''',''I'') where ''I'' denotes the [[identity functor]] '''Set''' → '''Set'''.

The requirement that ''U'' be faithful means that it maps different morphisms between the same objects to different functions.  However, ''U'' may map different objects to the same set and, if this occurs, it will also map different morphisms to the same function.

For example, if ''S'' and ''T'' are two different topologies on the same set ''X'', then 
(''X'',''S'') and (''X'',''T'') are distinct objects in the category '''Top''' of topological spaces and continuous maps, but mapped to the same set ''X'' by the forgetful functor '''Top''' → '''Set'''.  Moreover, the identity morphism (''X'',''S'') → (''X'',''S'') and the identity morphism (''X'',''T'') → (''X'',''T'') are considered distinct morphisms in '''Top''', but they have the same underlying function, namely the identity function on ''X''.

Similarly, any set with 4 elements can be given two non-isomorphic group structures: one isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;; the other isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Further examples ==

# Any group ''G'' may be regarded as an "abstract" category with one arbitrary object, &lt;math&gt;\ast&lt;/math&gt;, and one morphism for each element of the group.  This would not be counted as concrete according to the intuitive notion described at the top of this article.  But every faithful [[group action|''G''-set]] (equivalently, every representation of ''G'' as a [[permutation group|group of permutations]]) determines a faithful functor ''G'' → '''Set'''. Since every group acts faithfully on itself, ''G'' can be made into a concrete category in at least one way.
# Similarly, any [[poset]] ''P'' may be regarded as an abstract category with a unique arrow ''x'' → ''y'' whenever ''x'' ≤  ''y''.  This can be made concrete by defining a functor ''D'' : ''P'' → '''Set''' which maps each object ''x'' to &lt;math&gt;D(x)=\{a \in P : a \leq x\}&lt;/math&gt; and each arrow ''x'' → ''y'' to the inclusion map &lt;math&gt;D(x) \hookrightarrow D(y)&lt;/math&gt;.  
# The category '''[[Category of relations|Rel]]''' whose objects are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and whose morphisms are [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] can be made concrete by taking ''U'' to map each set ''X'' to its power set &lt;math&gt;2^X&lt;/math&gt; and each relation &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq X \times Y&lt;/math&gt; to the function &lt;math&gt;\rho: 2^X \rightarrow 2^Y&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\rho(A)=\{y \in Y : \exists x{\in}A~.~xRy\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Noting that power sets are [[complete lattice]]s under inclusion, those functions between them arising from some relation ''R'' in this way are exactly the [[Complete lattice#Morphisms of complete lattices|supremum-preserving maps]].  Hence '''Rel''' is equivalent to a full subcategory of the category '''Sup''' of [[complete lattices]] and their sup-preserving maps.  Conversely, starting from this equivalence we can recover ''U'' as the composite '''Rel''' → '''Sup''' → '''Set''' of the forgetful functor for '''Sup''' with this embedding of '''Rel''' in '''Sup'''.
# The category '''Set'''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; can be embedded into '''Rel''' by representing each set as itself and each function ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' as the relation from ''Y'' to ''X'' formed as the set of pairs (''f''(''x''),''x'') for all ''x'' ∈ ''X''; hence '''Set'''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; is concretizable.  The forgetful functor which arises in this way is the [[Functor#Examples|contravariant powerset functor]] '''Set'''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; → '''Set'''.  
# It follows from the previous example that the opposite of any concretizable category ''C'' is again concretizable, since if ''U'' is a faithful functor ''C'' → '''Set''' then ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; may be equipped with the composite ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; → '''Set'''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; → '''Set'''.  
# If ''C'' is any small category, then there exists a faithful functor ''P'' : '''Set'''&lt;sup&gt;''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; → '''Set''' which maps a presheaf ''X'' to the coproduct &lt;math&gt;\coprod_{c \in \mathrm{ob}C} X(c)&lt;/math&gt;.  By composing this with the [[Yoneda embedding]] ''Y'':''C'' → '''Set'''&lt;sup&gt;''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; one obtains a faithful functor ''C'' → '''Set'''.  
# For technical reasons, the category '''Ban'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of [[Banach spaces]] and  [[contraction (operator theory)|linear contractions]] is often equipped not with the "obvious" forgetful functor but the functor ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : '''Ban'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → '''Set''' which maps a Banach space to its (closed) [[unit ball]].

== Counter-examples ==

The category '''[[homotopy category of topological spaces|hTop]]''', where the objects are [[topological space]]s and the morphisms are [[homotopy|homotopy classes]] of continuous functions, is an example of a category that is not concretizable. 
While the objects are sets (with additional structure), the morphisms are not actual functions between them, but rather classes of functions. 
The fact that there does not exist ''any'' faithful functor from '''hTop''' to '''Set''' was first proven by [[Peter Freyd]].  
In the same article, Freyd cites an earlier result that the category of "small categories and [[natural equivalence]]-classes of functors" also fails to be concretizable.

== Implicit structure of concrete categories ==

Given a concrete category (''C'',''U'') and a [[cardinal number]] ''N'', let ''U&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;'' be the functor ''C'' → '''Set''' determined by ''U&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;(c) = (U(c))&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;''.  
Then a [[subfunctor]] of ''U&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;'' is called an ''N-ary predicate'' and a 
[[natural transformation]] ''U&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;'' → ''U'' an ''N-ary operation''.

The class of all ''N''-ary predicates and ''N''-ary operations of a concrete category (''C'',''U''), with ''N'' ranging over the class of all cardinal numbers, forms a [[proper class|large]] [[signature (logic)|signature]].  The category of models for this signature then contains a full subcategory which is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to ''C''.

== Relative concreteness ==

In some parts of category theory, most notably [[topos theory]], it is common to replace the category '''Set''' with a different category ''X'', often called a ''base category''. 
For this reason, it makes sense to call a pair (''C'',''U'') where ''C'' is a category and ''U'' a faithful functor ''C'' → ''X'' a '''concrete category over''' ''X''.
For example, it may be useful to think of the models of a theory [[Structure (mathematical logic)#Many-sorted structures|with ''N'' sorts]] as forming a concrete category over '''Set'''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;.

In this context, a concrete category over '''Set''' is sometimes called a ''construct''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3139">The '''conditionality principle''' is a Fisherian principle of [[statistical inference]] that [[Allan Birnbaum]] formally defined and studied in his 1962 [[Journal of the American Statistical Association|JASA]] article. Informally, the conditionality principle can be taken as the claim that experiments which were not actually performed are statistically irrelevant.

Together with the [[sufficiency principle]], Birnbaum's version of the principle implies the famous [[likelihood principle]]. Although the relevance of the proof to data analysis remains controversial among statisticians, many [[Bayesian inference|Bayesians]] and likelihoodists consider the likelihood principle foundational for statistical inference.

==Formulation==

The conditionality principle makes an assertion about an experiment ''E'' that can be described as a mixture of several component experiments ''E&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' where ''h'' is an [[ancillary statistic]] (i.e. a statistic whose probability distribution does not depend on unknown parameter values). This means that observing a specific outcome ''x'' of experiment ''E'' is equivalent to observing the value of ''h'' and taking an observation ''x&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' from the component experiment ''E&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The conditionality principle can be formally stated thus:

'''Conditionality Principle''': If ''E'' is any experiment having the form of a mixture of component experiments ''E&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', then for each outcome &lt;math&gt;(E_h, x_h)&lt;/math&gt; of ''E'', [...] the evidential meaning of any outcome ''x'' of any mixture experiment ''E'' is the same as that of the corresponding outcome ''x&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the corresponding component experiment ''E&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', ignoring the over-all structure of the mixed experiment (See Birnbaum 1962). An illustration of the conditionality principle, in a [[bioinformatics]] context, is given by Barker (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barker | first1 = D | year = 2014 | title = Seeing the wood for the trees: philosophical aspects of classical, Bayesian and likelihood approaches in statistical inference and some implications for phylogenetic analysis | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10539-014-9455-x | journal = Biology and Philosophy | volume =  30| issue = | pages =  505–525| doi = 10.1007/s10539-014-9455-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4155">'''Denailing''' is the extraction of the nails from the fingers and/or toes, either as a medical procedure to treat severe nail infections, or as a method of [[torture]]. The United Nations [[Istanbul Protocol]] describes nail removal and the insertion of objects such as wire under the nail as forms of torture. Removed nails are capable of growing back normally over several months if the [[nail matrix]] is left intact through surgical extraction. However, if the matrix is damaged by trauma, it can result in an overgrowth of tissue from the proximal nail fold, resulting in the formation of [[pterygium]]. Particularly, if the nail matrix is burnt by a heated instrument, subsequent growth may produce nails which are striped, thin, or broken into longitudinal segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Istanbul Protocol: Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|date=2004|publisher=United Nations|location=New York and Geneva|pages=29–38|edition=Professional Training Series No. 8/Rev.1|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/training8Rev1en.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval sources described the denailing interrogation process as conducted by laying the prisoner on a tabletop—securing the hands by chains around the wrists and the bare feet by chains around the ankles—and using a metal forceps or pliers&amp;mdash;often heated red-hot&amp;mdash;to individually grasp each nail in turn and slowly pry it from the nail bed before tearing it off the finger or toe. A more painful variant used in medieval Spain was performed by introducing a sharp wedge of wood or metal between the flesh and each nail and slowly hammering the wedge under the nail until it was torn free.&lt;ref&gt;A. Hirsch, ''ed.'', ''The Book of Torture and Executions'' (Toronto: Golden Books, 1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cruel variant involved using rough skewers of wood or bone dipped in boiling sulfur. A number of such skewers were slowly driven into the flesh under the prisoner's toenails. Alternately, the skewer was dipped in boiling oil, which served a dual purpose of both burning the incredibly sensitive flesh and lubricating the needle so that the torturer could freely explore a wide surface area beneath the toenail. When enough skewers had been driven home to pry each nail loose from its bed, the nail was torn out at the root with a pair of pliers. This was a favorite technique of torture in the German witch-hunter's arsenal, being extremely inexpensive, portable, and easy to inflict.  It is also recorded that, in more recent times—particularly, during the [[Armenian genocide]] of the 1910s—phonograph needles were driven under fingernails and toenails to torture the prisoner before his nails were torn out with pliers.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Scott, ''A History of Torture'' (London: Merchant, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|Italy's republican referendum]] after World War II, efforts to prosecute former officials in the Fascist government for [[collaborationism]] and [[war crimes]] resulted in the legal differentiation between the concepts of normal brutality, cruel brutality, and ''particularly cruel brutality''. Only in the case of particularly cruel brutality would the accused be rejected for amnesty. Denailing was generally considered to fall under the first two categories, as for a brutality to be considered ''particularly cruel'', it had to "horrify even those who are familiar with torture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caroli|first1=Paolo|title=The Role of the Judiciary Within the Construction of Collective Memory.

In [[engineering]], a '''design choice''' is a possible solution to a problem.  Given a design task and a governing set of criteria (''design specifications''), several conceptual designs may be drafted.  Each of these preliminary concepts is a potential design choice. Many never advance beyond the preliminary phase; those that are developed to the point at which they could be applied become the pool from which the final selection is  made.  This process stems from the principle that there is usually no uniquely right way of accomplishing any task.  The final selection is often made on a financial basis; i.e., the least expensive design is chosen in a bid process.  

In [[civil engineering]],  design choices usually derive from basic principles of [[materials science]] and [[structural design]].  A suspension bridge, for example, uses the fact that [[steel]] is extremely efficient in [[tension (mechanics)|tension]], while a [[prestressed concrete bridge]] takes advantage of [[concrete]]'s relatively low cost by weight and its ability to sustain high compressive loading (see [[compression (physical)|compression]]).

'''Education in Japan''' is compulsory at the elementary and lower secondary levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fpcj.jp/modules/news22/index.php?page=article&amp;storyid=18&amp;topicid=1 |title=Foreign Press Club of Japan Fact Book |publisher=Fpcj.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616132127/http://fpcj.jp/modules/news22/index.php?page=article&amp;storyid=18&amp;topicid=1 |archivedate=2013-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most students attend public schools through the lower secondary level, but [[private education]] is popular at the upper secondary and university levels.

Education prior to elementary school is provided at [[kindergarten]]s and [[Day care|day-care]] centers. Public and private day-care centers take children from under age 1 on up to 5 years old. The programmes for those children aged 3–5 resemble those at kindergartens. The educational approach at kindergartens varies greatly from unstructured environments that emphasize play to highly structured environments that are focused on having the child pass the entrance exam at a private elementary school. The academic year starts from April and ends in March, having summer vacation in August and winter vacation in the end of December to the beginning of January. Also, there are few days of holidays between academic years. The period of academic year is the same all through elementary level to higher educations nationwide.

Japanese students consistently rank highly among OECD students in terms of quality and performance in reading literacy, math, and sciences. The average student scored 540 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the country has one of the world's highest-educated labour forces among OECD countries.&lt;ref name="Education OECD Better Life"/&gt; Its populace is well educated and its society highly values education as a platform for social mobility and for gaining employment in the country's high-tech economy. The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan’s post-war [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|economic growth]]. Tertiary-educated adults in Japan, particularly graduates in sciences and engineering, benefit economically and socially from their education and skills in the country's high tech economy.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.oecd.org/edu/Japan-EAG2014-Country-Note.pdf | title=Japan | publisher=OECD | accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spending on education as a proportion of GDP is below the OECD average. Although expenditure per student is comparatively high in Japan, total expenditure relative to GDP remains small.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2015, Japan’s public spending on education amounted to just 3.5 percent of its GDP, below the [[OECD]] average of 4.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/25/national/public-education-spending-japan-lowest-oecd-sixth-straight-year/#.WBQMCxM5p88 | title=Public education spending in Japan lowest in OECD for sixth straight year | publisher=The Japan Times | accessdate=28 October 2016 | author=Tomoko Otake}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the country ranked fourth for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 48 percent. In addition, bachelor's degrees are held by 59 percent of Japanese aged 25–34, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; As the Japanese economy is largely scientific and technological based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities. About 75.9 percent of high school graduates attended a university, junior college, trade school, or other [[Higher education in Japan|higher education]] institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statist/05101901/005.pdf |title=School Education |publisher=[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|MEXT]] |accessdate=March 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102112620/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statist/05101901/005.pdf |archivedate=January 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan's education system played a central part in Japan's recovery and [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|rapid economic growth]] in the decades following the end of [[World War II]]. After World War II, the [[Fundamental Law of Education]] and the School Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the school system that would be in effect for many decades: six years of [[Primary education|elementary school]], three years of [[Middle school|junior high school]], three years of high school, and two or four years of university.
Although Japan ranks highly on the [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] tests, its educational system has been criticized for its focus on standardized testing and conformity;&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/the-limits-of-japanese-education-and-its-focus-on-cramming/?_r=0 |title=Bad Education |last=Harney |first=Alexandra |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=January 24, 2013 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; bullying problems;&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/01/asia/japan-teen-suicides/ |title=Japan's worst day for teen suicides |last=Wright |first=Rebecca |publisher=CNN |date=September 1, 2015 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/japans-cutthroat-school-system-a-cautionary-tale-for-the-us/281612/ |title=Japan's Cutthroat School System: A Cautionary Tale for the U.S. |last=Berlatsky |first=Noah |publisher=''The Atlantic |date=November 22, 2013 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/06/interview-bullying-lgbt-kids-japans-schools |title=Interview: The Bullying of LGBT Kids in Japan's Schools |last=Braunschweiger |first=Army |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=May 6, 2016 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}} "School bullying is notorious in Japan and has been for decades.

==History==
{{main|History of education in Japan}}
[[File:Terakoya for girls.jpg|thumb|right|[[Terakoya]] for girls in the [[Edo period]]]]

Formal education in Japan began with the adoption of [[Chinese culture]], in the 6th century. [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teachings as well as [[science]]s, [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[divination]] and [[Japanese literature|literature]] were taught at the courts of [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and [[Kyoto|Heian]]. Scholar officials were chosen through an [[Imperial examination]] system. But contrary to China, the system never fully took hold and titles and posts at the court remained hereditary family possessions. The rise of the ''[[Samurai|bushi]]'', the military class, during the [[Kamakura period]] ended the influence of scholar officials, but Buddhist monasteries remained influential centers of learning.

In the [[Edo period]], the  [[Yushima Seidō]] in Edo was the chief educational institution of the state; and at its head was the ''Daigaku-no-kami'', a title which identified the leader of the Tokugawa training school for shogunate bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Boyd. (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=JBqWbDmFsfEC&amp;pg=PA522&amp;dq= ''Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing,'' Vol. 1, p. 522;] De Bary, William ''et al.'' (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=6wS_ijD6DSgC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=  ''Sources of Japanese Tradition,'' Vol. 2, p. 69.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the [[daimyō]] vied for power in the largely pacified country. Since their influence could not be raised through war, they competed on the economic field. Their warrior-turned-bureaucrat Samurai elite had to be educated not only in military strategy and the martial arts, but also agriculture and accounting. Likewise, the wealthy merchant class needed education for their daily business, and their wealth allowed them to be patrons of arts and science. But temple schools ([[terakoya]]) educated peasants too, and it is estimated that at the end of the Edo period 50% of the male and 20% of the female population possessed some degree of literacy. Even though contact with foreign countries was restricted, books from China and Europe were eagerly imported and [[Rangaku]] ("Dutch studies") became a popular area of scholarly interest.

There were facilities that were created to specifically educate samurai and their children to perpetuate morality and mindfulness of their class. These schools, hanko schools, were where scholars would bring together samurai to listen to lectures on Confucianism, military arts, and other subjects. Samurai would then attempt to teach villagers what they had learned, “proper guidance to the common people’s spirit and manners,” by posting flyers and creating handbooks &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toyosawa|first=Noboru|date=1961|title=Adult Eduction in Japan in the Edo Period|doi=10.1177/074171366101200102|journal=Adult Education|volume=12|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some Shogun and Daimyo were also interested in spreading education throughout their protected land with the target audience as adult commoners and children. Elementary education was imparted as well as writing and morality lessons. The Shirakawa Village School’s town bulletin explains the point of education for the commoners, “If not only the important people of the village but also the lesser people have continuous teaching from the appointed village schools, they will gain understanding” &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. ‘Commoners’ would also form many communal gatherings to attempt and Englishmen themselves with the help of a scholar. To name one, [[Baigan Ishida]], who was a great orator and writer that reached the outcropping of the merchant class. There were [[Wakashu-gumi|wakashu]]-gumi, or youth groups, that consisted of young men ages fourteen to seventeen, who at these groups learned about ceremonies, cooperative living, language, manners, marriage, straw weaving, and world information, not to mention talking and singing. Japan was thriving with the want for enlightenment. One may say the need for more education is one of the reasons why the Tokugawa Shogunate failed in 1868. 

===Meiji Restoration===
After the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, the methods and structures of Western learning were adopted as a means to make Japan a strong, modern nation. Students and even high-ranking government officials were sent abroad to study, such as the [[Iwakura mission]]. Foreign scholars, the so-called ''[[Foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan|o-yatoi gaikokujin]]'', were invited to teach at newly founded universities and military academies. Compulsory education was introduced, mainly after the [[Prussian education system|Prussian model]]. In order to aid in the modernization the country, the Meiji government built a public library in 1872 modeled after Western architecture. The Japan Library Association (or the JLA) was founded in 1892 to promote the library. However, public education became the main focus of the Meiji government before they could strengthen the library’s presence in 1899. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kc.tsukuba.ac.jp/div-comm/pdf/Library_in_Japan.pdf|title=Public Libraries in Japan|last=Nagata|first=Haruki|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;By 1890, only 20 years after the resumption of full international relations, Japan discontinued employment of the foreign consultants.

A modern concept of childhood emerged in Japan after 1850 as part of its engagement with the West. Meiji period leaders decided the nation-state had the primary role in mobilizing individuals - and children - in service of the state. The Western-style school was introduced as the agent to reach that goal. By the 1890s, schools were generating new sensibilities regarding childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Platt, "Japanese Childhood, Modern Childhood: The Nation-State, the School, and 19th-Century Globalization," '' Journal of Social History,'' Summer 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 4, pp 965-985&lt;/ref&gt;  After 1890 Japan had numerous reformers, child experts, magazine editors, and well-educated mothers who bought into the new sensibility. They taught the upper middle class a model of childhood that included children having their own space where they read children's books, played with educational toys and, especially, devoted enormous time to school homework. These ideas rapidly disseminated through all social classes.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen S. Uno, ''Passages to Modernity: Motherhood, Childhood, and Social Reform in Early Twentieth Century Japan'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Jones, ''Children as Treasures: Childhood and the Middle Class in Early Twentieth Century Japan'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-WWII===
After the defeat in World War II, the [[Occupation of Japan|Allied occupation]] government set [[Educational reform in occupied Japan|education reform]] as one of its primary goals, to eradicate militarist teachings and convert Japan into a pacifist democracy. Nine years of education was made mandatory, with six years in elementary education and three in junior high as an emulation of the American educational system. A number of reforms were carried out in the post-war period that aimed at easing the burden of entrance examinations, promoting internationalization and information technologies, diversifying education and supporting lifelong learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Lessons from PISA for the United States |chapter=Japan: A Story of Sustained Excellence |chapter-url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/lessons-from-pisa-for-the-united-states/japan-a-story-of-sustained-excellence_9789264096660-7-en  |date=2011-05-17|publisher=Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)|pages=137–157|language=en|doi=10.1787/9789264096660-7-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shimizutani|first=Satoshi|date=2011-11-01|title=Education Reform in Japan: A Course for Lifelong Learning|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/13439006.2011.630853|journal=Asia-Pacific Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=105–114|doi=10.1080/13439006.2011.630853|issn=1343-9006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to ease Japanese postwar sentiments, any nationalistic, militaristic, authoritarian, or anti-American content was blackened from learning materials. This practice was known as ''suminuru'', and was used as the primary method of educational reform until newly fashioned texts, Kuni no ayumi (Footsteps of the Nation), Nihon rekishi (Japanese History), and Minshushugi (Democracy) were written by the Ministry of Education and Civil Information and Education Section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.binghamton.edu/history/resources/journal-of-history/stephen-buono.html|title=Binghamton University - History Department: Resources: Journal of History|website=www.binghamton.edu|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Education is now known as the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT) and is responsible for educational administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/en/about/museumofmext/index.htm|title=MEXT : Museum of MEXT|website=www.mext.go.jp|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In successive international assessment tests, Japan's fourth- and eighth-grade students have consistently ranked in the top five globally in both mathematics and science (see [[TIMSS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2003: 4th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/timss03tables.asp?Quest=1&amp;Figure=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2003: 4th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/TIMSS03Tables.asp?Quest=1&amp;Figure=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2003: 8th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/timss03tables.asp?figure=5&amp;Quest=5|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2003: 8th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/timss03tables.asp?figure=5&amp;Quest=6|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2007: Math|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table07_1.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2007: Science|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table07_3.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2011: 4th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table11_2.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2011: 4th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table11_4.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2011: 8th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table11_3.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2011: 8th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table11_5.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite concerns that academic skills for Japanese students may have declined since the mid-1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Matsutani, Minoru, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120110i1.html Student count, knowledge sliding]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 10 January 2012, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's students showed a significant improvement in math and science scores in the 2011 TIMSS survey, compared to the 2007 scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese students improve test scores in math, science|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/12/12/national/japanese-students-improve-test-scores-in-math-science/|website=Japan Times|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School grades==
The school year in Japan begins in April and classes are held from Monday to either Friday or Saturday, depending on the school. The school year consists of two or three terms, which are separated by short holidays in spring and winter, and a six-week-long summer break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2150.html |title=Japanese education system |publisher=Japan-guide.com |date=2002-06-09 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower secondary school===
{{main|Secondary education in Japan}}
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
{{TIMSSScores2007}}
[[File:Classroom2.jpg|thumb|A typical classroom in a Japanese junior high school]]

Lower secondary school covers grades seven through nine, with children typically aged twelve through fifteen. There are 3.5 million primary school students in Japan as of 2012, down from over 5.3 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=Statistics&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Statistics|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statistics/index.htm|website=Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132525/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statistics/index.htm|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the number of junior high schools has remained relatively static, falling from 11,275 in 1990 to 10,699 in 2012. The number of junior high school teachers has also changed little, with 257,605 junior high school teachers in 1990, and 253,753 in 2012). Approximately 8% of junior high students attend a private junior high school (accounting for 7% of all junior high schools). Private schools are considerably more expensive: as of 2012, the average annual cost of private primary school attendance was ¥1,295,156 per student, roughly thrice the ¥450,340 cost for a public school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/List.do?bid=000001051862&amp;cycode=0|title=統計表一覧　政府統計の総合窓口　GL08020103|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's compulsory education ends at grade nine, but less than 2% drop out; 60% of students advanced to senior education as of 1960, increasing rapidly to over 90% by 1980, rising further each year until reaching 98.3% as of 2012.&lt;ref name="Education Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statistics/index.htm|title=MEXT : Statistics|date=|publisher=Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|access-date=|ref=Statistics|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132525/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statistics/index.htm|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers often major in their respective subjects, and more than 80% graduate from a four-year college. Classes are large, with an average of thirty-eight students per class, and each class is assigned a homeroom teacher, doubling as a counselor. Unlike kindergarten students, primary school students have different teachers for different subjects. However, the teacher changes rooms for each period, rather than the students.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Instruction in primary schools is often in the form of lectures. Teachers also use other media, such as television and radio, and there is some laboratory work. By 1989 about 45% of all public primary schools had computers, including schools that used them only for administrative purposes. All course contents are specified in the Course of Study for Lower-Secondary Schools.  Some subjects, such as Japanese language and mathematics, are coordinated with the elementary curriculum. Others, such as foreign-language study, begin at this level, though from April 2011, English became a compulsory part of the elementary school curriculum.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The junior school curriculum covers Japanese language, social studies, mathematics, science, music, fine arts, health, and physical education. All students are also exposed to industrial arts and homemaking. Moral education and special activities continue to receive attention. Most students also participate in one of a range of school clubs that occupy them until around 6 p.m. most weekdays (including weekends and often before school as well), as part of an effort to address juvenile delinquency.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

A growing number of primary school students also attend ''[[juku]]'', private extracurricular study schools, in the evenings and on weekends. A focus by students upon these other studies and the increasingly structured demands upon students' time have been criticized by teachers and in the media for contributing to a decline in classroom standards and student performance in recent years.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The ministry recognizes a need to improve the teaching of all foreign languages, especially English. To improve instruction in spoken English, the government invites many young native speakers of English to Japan to serve as assistants to school boards and prefectures under its [[JET Programme|Japan Exchange and Teaching Program]] (JET). Beginning with 848 participants in 1987, the program grew to a high of 6,273 participants in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/jet/participants.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226053847/http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/jet/participants.pdf |date=February 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program was in a decline in recent years due to several factors, including shrinking local school budgets funding the program, as well as an increasing number of school boards hiring their foreign native speakers directly or through lower-paying, private agencies.  Today, the program is again growing due to English becoming a compulsory part of the elementary school curriculum in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20060328zg.html |title=Times get tough for teachers |work=[[The Japan Times|The Japan Times Online]] |date=2006-03-28 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upper secondary school===
[[File:Japanese high school classroom.jpg|thumb|A typical Japanese high school classroom]]
{{main|Secondary education in Japan}}
Though [[upper secondary school|upper-secondary school]] is not compulsory in Japan, 94% of all junior high school graduates enrolled as of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statist/index.htm |title=STATISTICAL ABSTRACT 2006 edition |accessdate=2008-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617061845/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statist/index.htm |archivedate=2008-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Private upper-secondary schools account for about 55% of all upper-secondary schools, and neither public nor private schools are free. The [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Ministry of Education]] estimated that annual family expenses for the education of a child in a public upper-secondary school were about ¥300,000 in the 1980s and that private upper-secondary schools were about twice as expensive.

The most common type of upper-secondary school has a full-time, general program that offered academic courses for students preparing for higher education as well as technical and vocational courses for students expecting to find employment after graduation. More than 70% of upper-secondary school students were enrolled in the general academic program in the late 1980s. A small number of schools offer part-time programs, evening courses, or correspondence education.

The first-year programs for students in both academic and commercial courses are similar. They include basic academic courses, such as [[Japanese language]], [[English language|English]], [[mathematics]], and [[science]]. In upper-secondary school, differences in ability are first publicly acknowledged, and course content and course selection are far more individualized in the second year. However, there is a core of academic material throughout all programs.

Vocational-technical programs includes several hundred specialized courses, such as information processing, navigation, fish farming, business, English, and ceramics. Business and industrial courses are the most popular, accounting for 72% of all students in full-time vocational programs in 1989.

Most upper-secondary teachers are university graduates. Upper-secondary schools are organized into departments, and teachers specialize in their major fields although they teach a variety of courses within their disciplines. Teaching depends largely on the lecture system, with the main goal of covering the very demanding curriculum in the time allotted. Approach and subject coverage tends to be uniform, at least in the public schools.

Training of disabled students, particularly at the upper-secondary level, emphasizes vocational education to enable students to be as independent as possible within society. Vocational training varies considerably depending on the student's disability, but the options are limited for some. It is clear that the government is aware of the necessity of broadening the range of possibilities for these students. Advancement to higher education is also a goal of the government, and it struggles to have institutions of higher learning accept more students with disabilities.

===Universities and colleges===
{{main|Higher education in Japan}}
Higher education in Japan is provided at universities (daigaku), junior colleges (tanki daigaku), colleges of technology (koto senmon gakko) and special training schools and community colleges (senshu gakko). Of these four types of institutions, only universities and junior colleges are strictly considered postsecondary education providers.&lt;ref name="Clark, Nick"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wenr.wes.org/2005/05/wenr-mayjune-2005-education-in-japan | title=Education in Japan | date=1 May 2005 | accessdate=28 October 2016 | author=Clark, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, more than 2.8 million students were enrolled in 778 universities. At the top of the higher education structure, these institutions provide a four-year training leading to a [[bachelor's degree]], and some offer six-year programs leading to a professional degree. There are two types of public four-year colleges: the 86 [[List of national universities in Japan|national universities]] (including the [[Open University of Japan]]) and the 95 local [[public university|public universities]], founded by [[prefecture]]s and [[municipality|municipalities]]. The 597 remaining four-year colleges in 2010 were private. With a wealth of opportunities for students wishing to pursue tertiary education, the nation’s prestigious schools are the most appealing for students seeking to gain top employment prospects.&lt;ref name="Clark, Nick"/&gt;

The overwhelming majority of college students attend full-time day programs. In 1990 the most popular courses, enrolling almost 40 percent of all undergraduate students, were in the [[social sciences]], including [[business]], [[law]], and [[accounting]]. Other popular subjects were [[engineering]] (19 percent), the [[humanities]] (15 percent), and [[education]] (7 percent).

The average costs (tuition, fees, and living expenses) for a year of higher education in 1986 were ¥1.4 million. To help defray expenses, students frequently work part-time or borrow money through the government-supported Japan Scholarship Association. Assistance is also offered by local governments, nonprofit corporations, and other institutions.

According to the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' and [[École des Mines de Paris]], the top-ranking universities in Japan are the [[University of Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alnaja7.org/success/Education/times_world_ranking_2005.pdf |title=The Times Higher Education Supplement World University Rankings |date=2005-10-28 |publisher=TSL Education Ltd. |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723181357/http://www.alnaja7.org/success/Education/times_world_ranking_2005.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mines-paristech.fr/Actualites/PR/EMP-ranking.html  World University Rankings] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5qEQh0ndo?url=http://www.mines-paristech.fr/Actualites/PR/EMP-ranking.html |date=2010-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[QS World University Rankings|QS Asia University Rankings]] Top 40 included the [[University of Tokyo]] at 13th position,[[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] at 14th, [[Osaka University]] at 15th, [[Kyoto University]] at 17th, [[Tohoku University]] at 20th, [[Nagoya University]] at 27th, [[Kyushu University]] at 29th, [[Keio University]] at 36th, [[Waseda University]] at 39th, and the [[University of Tsukuba]] at 40th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/asian-university-rankings/2018|title=Asian University Rankings 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Topuniversities.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the 2011 [[Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings]], there are 33 Japanese universities in the top 100 Asian university rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/japanese-universities-dominate-top-10-spots-in-asian-univ-rankings |title=China universities dominate top 10 spots in Asian univ rankings |publisher=Japantoday.com |date=2009-05-11 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extracurricular activities ==
The Japanese educational system is supplemented by a heavy emphasis on extracurricular activities, also known as [[Tutor|shadow education]], which are any educational activities that don't take place during formal schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamamoto|first=Yoko|last2=Brinton|first2=Mary C.|date=2010-02-19|title=Cultural Capital in East Asian Educational Systems|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0038040709356567|journal=Sociology of Education|language=en|volume=83|issue=1|pages=67–83|doi=10.1177/0038040709356567}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely motivated by the extreme weight that is placed upon [[Higher education in Japan#Entrance|formal examinations]] as a prerequisite to attend university, something that is seen as integral to their future career and social status. In order to gain a competitive edge, Japanese families are willing to expend money and have their child put in time and effort into a supplementary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ENTRICH|first=Steve R.|date=2015-07-01|title=The Decision for Shadow Education in Japan: Students’ Choice or Parents’ Pressure?|url=https://academic.oup.com/ssjj/article/18/2/193/1623097|journal=Social Science Japan Journal|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=193–216|doi=10.1093/ssjj/jyv012|issn=1369-1465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of shadow education include ''mogi shiken'', which are practice exams given by private companies that determine the child's chances of getting into a university. ''[[Juku]]'' are private after school classes that aim to develop abilities for students to excel in formal school curriculum or to prepare for university examinations. ''Ronin'' are students that undergo full-time preparation for university exams following high school due to their inability to get into their school of choice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=David Lee|last2=Baker|first2=David P.|date=1992|title=Shadow Education and Allocation in Formal Schooling: Transition to University in Japan|jstor=2781551|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1639–1657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 86% of students with college plans participate in at least one form of shadow education, with 60% participating in two or more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
Japanese students are faced with immense pressure to succeed academically from their parents, teachers, peers and society. This is largely a result of a society that has long placed a great amount of importance on education, and a system that places all of its weight upon a single examination that has significant life-long consequences. This pressure has led to behaviors such as school violence, cheating, suicide, and significant psychological harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japanese Education: Selective Bibliography of Psychosocial Aspects|last=Pike|first=Roberta|publisher=Jain Publishing Company|year=2007|isbn=9780895818690|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, students have experienced nervous breakdowns that have required hospitalization as young as twelve.

The Japanese educational system has also been criticized for failure to foster independent thinkers with cultural and artistic sensibility. Japanese students that attend schools overseas often face difficulty adapting and competing in that environment due to lack of international viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bracey|first=Gerald|date=December 1997|title=The Japanese Education System is a Failure, Say Some Japanese|url=|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume=79|pages=328–330|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emotional security''' is the measure of the stability of an [[individual]]'s [[emotional state]]. '''Emotional insecurity''' or simply '''insecurity''' is a [[feeling]] of general unease or nervousness that may be triggered by perceiving of [[Identity (social science)|oneself]] to be vulnerable or inferior in some way, or a sense of vulnerability or instability which threatens one's [[self-image]] or [[wikt:ego|ego]].

The concept is related to that of [[psychological resilience]] in as far as both concern the effects which setbacks or difficult situations have on an individual. However, ''resilience'' concerns over-all coping, also with reference to the individual's socioeconomic situation, whereas the ''emotional security'' specifically characterizes the emotional impact. In this sense, emotional security can be understood as part of resilience.

The notion of ''emotional security'' of an individual is to be distinguished from that of [[emotional safety]] or security provided by a non-threatening, supportive environment. A [[person]] who is susceptible to [[wikt:bout|bouts]] of [[depression (mood)|depression]] being triggered by minor setbacks is said to be less "emotionally secure". A person whose general [[happiness]] is not very shaken even by major disturbances in the [[pattern]] or [[fabric]] of their life might be said to be extremely emotionally secure.

==Emotional insecurity==
[[Abraham Maslow]] described an insecure person as a person who "perceives the world as a threatening jungle and most human beings as dangerous and selfish; feels a rejected and isolated person, anxious and hostile; is generally pessimistic and unhappy; shows signs of tension and conflict, tends to turn inward; is troubled by guilt-feelings, has one or another disturbance of self-esteem; tends to be neurotic; and is generally selfish and egocentric." (Maslow, 1942, pp 35). He viewed in every insecure person a continual, never dying, longing for security (Alegre (2008)).

A person who is insecure lacks confidence in his or her own value, and one or more of his or her capabilities, lacks trust in himself or herself or others, or has fears that a present positive state is temporary, and will let him or her down and cause him or her loss or distress by "going wrong" in the future. This is a common trait, which only differs in degree between people.

This is not to be confused with [[humility]], which involves recognizing one's shortcomings but still maintaining a healthy dose of self-confidence. Insecurity is not an objective evaluation of one's ability but an [[emotional]] interpretation. Two people with the same capabilities may have entirely different levels of insecurity.

Insecurity may contribute to the development of [[shyness]], [[paranoia]] and [[social]] withdrawal, or alternatively it may encourage compensatory behaviors such as [[wikt:arrogance|arrogance]], [[aggression]], or [[bullying]], in some cases.

The fact that the majority of human beings are emotionally vulnerable, and have the capacity to be hurt, implies that emotional insecurity could merely be a difference in awareness.

Insecurity has many effects in a person's life. There are several levels of it. It nearly always causes some degree of [[Solitude|isolation]] as a typically insecure person withdraws from people to some extent. The greater the insecurity, the higher the degree of isolation becomes. Insecurity is often rooted in a person's childhood years. Like offense and bitterness, it grows in layered fashion, often becoming an immobilizing force that sets a limiting factor in the person's life. Insecurity robs by degrees; the degree to which it is entrenched equals the degree of power it has in the person's life.
As insecurity can be distressing and feel threatening to the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], it can often be accompanied by a [[Control freak|controlling personality type]] or [[Avoidant personality disorder|avoidance]], as psychological [[defense mechanism]]s.

==Brain chemistry==
To a certain extent, emotional security is a function of [[brain chemistry]]: some people are naturally predisposed to feel less happy, and to be more adversely affected by natural events,{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} for example in the case of [[hypothyroidism]]. Certain medications, such as [[SSRI]]'s or even [[stimulant]]s, are often prescribed to address such natural deficiencies. The [[adverse effect|side-effects]] of these medications, however, in many cases can negate their positive effects, for example when certain [[anti-depressant]]s make it difficult or impossible to experience [[orgasm]] by making the brain incapable of cutting off the flow of certain hormones usually associated with positive emotions but necessary to suddenly block for short periods of time in order for orgasm to occur.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} It is also said that such medications blunt both 'the highs and the lows,' sapping, for some people, a valuable, inspiring energy from life.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} However, weighing the pros against the cons of such situations is something different for each individual, and in many cases the dangers of ''naturally low emotional security'' may be worse than the side-effects of the appropriate medication, especially such as when a person is suicidal.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Philosophies==
There are many [[philosophies]] which understand emotional security to be a product of ''outlook''. Such [[ideologies]] would advocate that there are safer steps than medicine one can take in order to increase one's emotional security. These options may range from [[self-help]] programs, [[substance abuse]] treatment programs, and [[psychotherapy]] to physical [[exercise]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] or religious [[Loyalty|devotion]]. While emotionally insecure people may feel [[lethargic]], sometimes their best option is to increase their [[endorphins]] through exercise; while they may be afraid of [[Social rejection|rejection]], this may lead to unhealthy loneliness, which the only way to overcome is to risk rejection by trying to make acquaintances. Practices such as [[yoga]] and [[Buddhism]] advocate [[abstinence]] from [[mind-altering substance]]s; yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice or discipline for achieving clarity of mind and security of [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] through training and disciplining the body,&lt;ref&gt;[[B. K. S. Iyengar]], [[Light on Yoga]] (Revised Edition 1977), with forward by [[Yehudi Menuhin]], Schocken Books, 1979 paperback, {{ISBN|0-8052-1031-8}} (544 pages)&lt;/ref&gt; while Buddhism is in [[essence]] a practice designed to address [[suffering]].

[[Philosophers]] of [[existentialism]] deal with issues relating to emotional insecurity quite frequently, focusing on the individual's spiritual condition in the world, existentialism being a more emotionally and psychologically oriented philosophy than other more rationalist schools. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] dealt with emotions such as anxiety, dread, and despair, pointing to the role they can play in bringing about life-changing transformation.

The '''ferret''' (''Mustela putorius furo'') is the [[Domestication|domesticated]] form of the [[European polecat]], a mammal belonging to the same [[genus]] as the [[weasel]], ''[[Mustela]]'' of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Mustelidae]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris &amp; Yalden 2008, pp. 485–487&lt;/ref&gt; They typically have brown, black, white, or mixed fur. They have an average length of {{convert|51|cm|in|abbr=on}} including a {{convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} tail, weigh about {{nowrap|{{convert|1.5|–|4|lb|sigfig=1}}}}, and have a natural lifespan of 7 to 10&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060721081758/http://www.bradleyhills.com/ferrets/surgery/health/ Bradley Hills Animal Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, on lifespan of Ferrets]. Bradleyhills.com. Retrieved 2012-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrets are sexually [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] predators with males being substantially larger than females.

Several other Mustelids also have the word ''ferret'' in their common names, including an [[endangered species]], the [[black-footed ferret]].

The history of the ferret's domestication is uncertain, like that of most other domestic animals, but it is likely that ferrets have been domesticated for at least 2,500&amp;nbsp;years. They are still used for hunting rabbits in some parts of the world, but increasingly they are kept only as pets.

Being so closely related to polecats, ferrets easily hybridize with them, and this has occasionally resulted in feral colonies of [[polecat-ferret hybrid]]s that have caused damage to native fauna, especially in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/animal-pests-a-z/ferrets/|title = Ferrets: New Zealand animal pests|date = 11 August 2006|accessdate = 25 July 2014|website = Department of Conservation|publisher = New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC)|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140724222620/http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/animal-pests-a-z/ferrets/|archivedate = 2014-07-24|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, some parts of the world have imposed restrictions on the keeping of ferrets.

==Etymology==
The name "ferret" is derived from the Latin ''furittus'', meaning "little thief", a likely reference to the common ferret penchant for secreting away small items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ferret ferret]. Merriam-webster.com. Retrieved 2012-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word ''ictis'' occurs in a play written by [[Aristophanes]], ''[[The Acharnians]]'', in 425 BC. Whether this was a reference to ferrets, polecats, or the similar [[Egyptian mongoose]] is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Thomson/&gt;

==Biology==

===Characteristics===
[[File:Mustela putorius furo profile.JPG|thumb|Ferret profile]]
Ferrets have a typical Mustelid body-shape, being long and slender. Their average length is about 50&amp;nbsp;cm including a 13-cm tail. Their [[pelage]] has various colorations including brown, black, white or mixed. They weigh between 0.7&amp;nbsp;kg and 2.0&amp;nbsp;kg and are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] as the males are substantially larger than females. The average [[gestation]] period is 42 days and females may have two or three litters each year. The [[Litter (animal)|litter]] size is usually between three and seven kits which are weaned after three to six weeks and become independent at three months. They become sexually mature at approximately six months and the average life span is seven to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://njvma.org/all-about-ferrets/ |publisher=New Jersey Veterinary Medical Association |title=All about ferrets |access-date=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elmwoodparkzoo.org/animal-domestic-ferret.php |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |title=Domestic ferret |publisher=Elmwood Park Zoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavior===
&lt;!-- do not add information on keeping ferrets as it will be deleted, wikipedia is not a "how to" manual&amp;nbsp;– see talk page--&gt;
Ferrets spend 14–18 hours a day asleep and are most active around the hours of dawn and dusk, meaning they are [[crepuscular]].&lt;ref name="Anon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pethealthinfo.org.uk/ferrets/|title=Ferrets|publisher=Pet Health Information|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike their polecat ancestors, which are solitary animals, most ferrets will live happily in social groups. A group of ferrets is commonly referred to as a "business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=John G.|title=Robertson's Words for a Modern Age: A Cross Reference of Latin and Greek Combining Elements|year=1991|publisher=Senior Scribe Publications|isbn=978-0-9630919-1-8|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5hlO8sgpCgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are territorial, like to burrow, and prefer to sleep in an enclosed area.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weaselwords.com/page/ferret_art036.php|title=Inherited behavior traits of the domesticated ferret|last=Brown|first=Susan, A|publisher=weaselwords.com|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other mustelids, ferrets have scent glands near their anus, the secretions from which are used in [[Spraying (animal behavior)|scent marking]]. Ferrets can recognize individuals from these anal gland secretions, as well as the sex of unfamiliar individuals.&lt;ref name="Clapperton1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Clapperton | first = BK |author2=Minot EO |author3=Crump DR  | title = An Olfactory Recognition System in the Ferret Mustela furo L.

As with [[skunks]], ferrets can release their [[anal gland]] secretions when startled or scared, but the smell is much less potent and dissipates rapidly. Most pet ferrets in the US are sold de-scented (anal glands removed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=Mark A.|last2=Tully|first2=Thomas N.|title=Manual of exotic pet practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMTUKwzPEvwC&amp;pg=PA372|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1-4160-0119-5|page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many other parts of the world, including the UK and other European countries, de-scenting is considered an [[Overview of discretionary invasive procedures on animals|unnecessary mutilation]].

If excited, they may perform a behavior called the "[[weasel war dance]]", characterized by frenzied sideways hops, leaps and bumping into nearby objects. Despite its common name, it is not aggressive but is a joyful invitation to play. It is often accompanied by a unique soft clucking noise, commonly referred to as "dooking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Schilling, Kim  |author2=Brown, Susan|title=Ferrets For Dummies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B81UEcbj28gC&amp;pg=PT302 |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-118-05154-2 |page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; When scared, ferrets will hiss; when upset, they squeak softly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tynes|first=Valerie V.|title=Behavior of Exotic Pets|year=2010|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=978-0-8138-0078-3 |page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet===
Ferrets are [[obligate carnivore]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Bruce H. (January 1999) [https://web.archive.org/web/20080511003517/http://www.afip.org/consultation/vetpath/ferrets/Clin_Path/ClinPath.html Controversy and Confusion in Interpretation of Ferret Clinical Pathology], Armed Forces Institute of Pathology: "...&amp;nbsp;the ferret, being by nature an obligate carnivore, has an extremely short digestive tract, and requires meals as often as every four to six hours."&lt;/ref&gt; The natural diet of their wild ancestors consisted of whole small prey, including meat, organs, bones, skin, feathers, and fur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&amp;A=479&amp;S=5 Rethinking The Ferret Diet – Info about species-appropriate diets, and the negative effects of commercially prepared diets, written by a veterinarian].

Ferrets imprint on their food at around six months old. This can make introducing new foods to an older ferret a challenge, and even simply changing brands of kibble may meet with resistance from a ferret that has never eaten the food as a kit. It is therefore advisable to expose young ferrets to as many different types and flavors of appropriate food as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.ferret.org/read/faq.html|work=American Ferret Association|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dentition===
[[Image:buffy teeth.jpg|thumb|Ferret dentition]]
Ferrets have four types of teeth (the number includes maxillary (upper) and mandibular (lower) teeth) with a [[dental formula]] of 3/3 1/1 4/4 1/2:
*Twelve small teeth (only a couple of millimeters) located between the canines in the front of the mouth. These are known as the [[incisor]]s and are used for grooming.
*Four [[Canine tooth|canines]] used for killing prey.
*Twelve [[premolar]] teeth that the ferret uses to chew food—located at the sides of the mouth, directly behind the canines. The ferret uses these teeth to cut through flesh, using them in a scissors action to cut the meat into digestible chunks.
*Six molars (two on top and four on the bottom) at the far back of the mouth are used to crush food.

===Health===
{{Main|Ferret health}}
[[Image:Jake 0314.jpg|thumb|Male ferret]]
Ferrets are known to suffer from several distinct health problems. Among the most common are cancers affecting the [[adrenal glands]], [[pancreas]], and [[Lymphoma in ferrets|lymphatic system]]. Viral diseases include [[canine distemper]] and influenza. Health problems can occur in unspayed females when not being used for breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://weaselwords.com/ferret-articles/an-owners-guide-to-ferret-health-care/ |title= An Owners Guide to Ferret Health Care|last1= Van Dahm |first1= Mary |website=WeaselWords.com|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain health problems have also been linked to ferrets being neutered before reaching sexual maturity.{{Citation needed|reason=This is anecdotally popular in the ferret community but needs a source to verify veracity|date=April 2014}} Certain colors of ferret may also carry a genetic defect known as [[Waardenburg syndrome]]. Similar to domestic cats, ferrets can also suffer from hairballs and dental problems.

==History of domestication==
[[File:Women hunting rabbits with a ferret.jpg|right|thumb|''Women hunting rabbits with a ferret'' in the [[Queen Mary Psalter]]]]
In common with most domestic animals, the original reason for ferrets being domesticated by human beings is uncertain, but it may have involved hunting. According to phylogenetic studies, the ferret was domesticated from the [[European polecat]] (''Mustela putorius''), and likely descends from a North African lineage of the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sato|first=JJ|author2=Hosoda, T; Wolsan, M; Tsuchiya, K; Yamamoto, M; Suzuki, H|title=Phylogenetic relationships and divergence times among mustelids (Mammalia: Carnivora) based on nucleotide sequences of the nuclear interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein and mitochondrial cytochrome b genes|journal=Zoological Science|date=February 2003|volume=20|issue=2|pages=243–64|pmid=12655187|doi=10.2108/zsj.20.243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of [[mitochondrial DNA]] suggests that ferrets were domesticated around 2,500 years ago. It has been claimed that the ancient Egyptians were the first to domesticate ferrets, but as no mummified remains of a ferret have yet been found, nor any [[hieroglyph]] of a ferret, and no polecat now occurs wild in the area, that idea seems unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Colonies of [[feral]] ferrets have established themselves in areas where there is no competition from similarly sized predators, such as in the [[Shetland Islands]] and in remote regions in New Zealand. Where ferrets coexist with polecats, hybridization is common. It has been claimed that New Zealand has the world's largest feral population of ferret-polecat hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feral Ferrets in New Zealand |work=California's Plants and Animals |publisher=California Department of Fish and Game |url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/hcpb/species/nuis_exo/ferret/ferret_issues_3.shtml |accessdate=2006-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905185101/http://www.dfg.ca.gov/hcpb/species/nuis_exo/ferret/ferret_issues_3.shtml |archivedate=2006-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, farmers in New Zealand demanded that ferrets be introduced into the country to control the rabbit population, which was also introduced by humans. Five ferrets were imported in 1879, and in 1882–1883, 32 shipments of ferrets were made from London, totaling 1,217 animals. Only 678 landed, and 198 were sent from Melbourne, Australia. On the voyage, the ferrets were mated with the European polecat, creating a number of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] that were capable of surviving in the wild. In 1884 and 1886, close to 4,000 ferrets and ferret hybrids, 3,099 weasels and 137 [[stoat]]s were turned loose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabbit control |work=A Hundred Years of Rabbit Impacts, and Future Control Options |publisher=New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) Rabbit Biocontrol Advisory Group |url=http://www.maf.govt.nz/MAFnet/articles-man/rbag/rbag0010.htm |accessdate=2006-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010617215222/http://www.maf.govt.nz/MAFnet/articles-man/rbag/rbag0010.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concern was raised that these animals would eventually prey on indigenous wildlife once rabbit populations dropped, and this is exactly what happened to New Zealand's bird species which previously had had no mammalian predators.

===Ferreting===
{{Main|Rabbiting}}
[[File:Ratting ferret 2.png|thumb|right|Muzzled ferret flushing a rat, as illustrated in Harding's ''Ferret Facts and Fancies'' (1915)]]
For millennia, the main use of ferrets was for hunting, or ''ferreting''. With their long, lean build, and inquisitive nature, ferrets are very well equipped for getting down holes and chasing rodents, rabbits and moles out of their burrows. [[Caesar Augustus]] sent ferrets or mongooses (named ''viverrae'' by [[Pliny the Elder|Plinius]]) to the [[Balearic Islands]] to control the rabbit plagues in 6 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Plinius the Elder, Natural History, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/8*.html#218 8 lxxxi 218] (in Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]], Book VIII |last=Pliny the Elder |authorlink=Pliny the Elder |others=[[Philemon Holland]] (trans) |year=1601 |chapter-url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/pliny8.html |accessdate=19 April 2011 |chapter=LV. Of Hares and Connies. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, in 1390, a law was enacted restricting the use of ferrets for hunting to the relatively wealthy:
{{quote|it is ordained that no manner of layman which hath not lands to the value of forty shillings a year shall from henceforth keep any greyhound or other dog to hunt, nor shall he use ferrets, nets, heys, harepipes nor cords, nor other engines for to take or destroy deer, hares, nor conies, nor other gentlemen's game, under pain of twelve months' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Mackay1891"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mackay, Thomas, ed. |title=Plea for Liberty |year=1891 |publisher=D. Appleton and Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Ferrets were first introduced into the New World in the 17th century, and were used extensively from 1860 until the start of World War II to protect grain stores in the American West from rodents. They are still used for hunting in some countries, including the United Kingdom, where rabbits are considered a [[Rabbit (ecology)|plague species]] by farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Mystery, Ferret Thefts Sweep Southern England|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304361604579290013495981126|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-03-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321170935/https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304361604579290013495981126|archive-date=2017-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is illegal in several countries where it is feared that ferrets could unbalance the ecology. In 2009 in Finland, where ferreting was previously unknown, the city of Helsinki began to use ferrets to restrict the city's rabbit population to a manageable level. Ferreting was chosen because in populated areas it is considered to be safer and less ecologically damaging than shooting the rabbits.

==As pets==
[[Image:Vinnie the Ferret in a War Dance Jump.jpg|thumb|right|A ferret in a [[Weasel war dance|war dance]] jump.]]

In the United States, ferrets were relatively rare pets until the 1980s. A government study by the California State Bird and Mammal Conservation Program estimated that by 1996 about 800,000 domestic ferrets were being kept as pets in the United States.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Jurek, R. M. (1998). [http://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=39971 A review of national and California population estimates of pet ferrets]. Calif. Dep. Fish and Game, Wildl. Manage. Div., Bird and Mammal Conservation Program Rep. 98-09. Sacramento, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many household pets, ferrets require a cage. For ferrets, a wire cage at least 18 inches long and deep and 30 inches wide or longer is needed. Ferrets cannot be housed in environments such as an aquarium because of the poor ventilation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/ferrets/tips/ferret_housing.html?credit=web_id139808899 |title=Ferret Housing: The Humane Society of the United States |website=www.humanesociety.org |access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is preferable that the cage have more than one level but this is not crucial. Usually two to three different shelves are used.

===Regulation===
*'''Australia''': It is illegal to keep ferrets as pets in '''Queensland''' or the '''Northern Territory'''; in the '''[[Australian Capital Territory]]''' a licence is required.
*'''Brazil''': They are allowed only if they are given a [[Microchip implant (animal)|microchip identification tag]] and sterilized.
*'''New Zealand''': It has been illegal to sell, distribute or breed ferrets in New Zealand since 2002 unless certain conditions are met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1953/0031/latest/DLM278701.html#DLM278701 Wildlife Act 1953]&amp;nbsp;– Schedule 8&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''United States''': Ferrets were once banned in many US states, but most of these laws were rescinded in the 1980s and 1990s as they became popular pets.

Although financial bets are placed, the event is primarily for entertainment purposes as opposed to 'serious' betting sports such as horse or greyhound racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ferret Racing {{!}} Countryman Fairs |url=http://www.countrymanfairs.co.uk/family-entertainment/ferret-racing |website=www.countrymanfairs.co.uk |accessdate=2015-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423173347/http://www.countrymanfairs.co.uk/family-entertainment/ferret-racing |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ferret Racing – Starescue – STA Ferret Rescue|url = http://www.starescue.org.uk/racing/4579482855|website = www.starescue.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ferrets are either albinos, with white fur and pink eyes, or display the typical dark masked sable coloration of their wild polecat ancestors. In recent years fancy breeders have produced a wide variety of colors and patterns. Color refers to the color of the ferret's guard hairs, undercoat, eyes, and nose; pattern refers to the concentration and distribution of color on the body, mask, and nose, as well as white markings on the head or feet when present. Some national organizations, such as the American Ferret Association, have attempted to classify these variations in their showing standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferret.org/events/colors/colorchart.html |title=American Ferret Association: Ferret Color and Pattern Standards |publisher=Ferret.org |accessdate=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four basic colors. The sable (including chocolate and dark brown), albino, dark eyed white (DEW), and the silver. All the other colors of a ferret are variations on one of these four categories.

===Waardenburg-like coloring===
[[Image:Coco 4056.JPG|right|thumb|White or albino ferret]]Ferrets with a white stripe on their face or a fully white head, primarily blazes, badgers, and pandas, almost certainly carry a congenital defect which shares some similarities to [[Waardenburg syndrome]]. This causes, among other things, a cranial deformation in the womb which broadens the skull, white face markings, and also partial or total deafness. It is estimated as many as 75&amp;nbsp;percent of ferrets with these Waardenburg-like colorings are deaf.

White ferrets were favored in the Middle Ages for the ease in seeing them in thick undergrowth. Leonardo da Vinci's painting ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' is likely mislabelled; the animal is probably a ferret, not a stoat, (for which "ermine" is an alternative name for the animal in its white winter coat). Similarly, the ermine portrait of Queen Elizabeth the First shows her with her pet ferret, which has been decorated with painted-on [[Heraldry|heraldic]] ermine spots.

"The Ferreter's Tapestry" is a 15th-century tapestry from [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy, France]], now part of the Burrell Collection housed in the Glasgow Museum and Art Galleries. It shows a group of peasants hunting rabbits with nets and white ferrets. This image was reproduced in ''Renaissance Dress in Italy 1400–1500'', by Jacqueline Herald, Bell &amp; Hyman.{{efn|{{ISBN|0-391-02362-4}}}}

''Gaston Phoebus' Book of the Hunt'' was written in approximately 1389 to explain how to hunt different kinds of animals, including how to use ferrets to hunt rabbits. Illustrations show how multicolored ferrets that were fitted with muzzles were used to chase rabbits out of their warrens and into waiting nets.

==Import restrictions==
* '''Australia'''&amp;nbsp;– Ferrets cannot be imported into Australia. A report drafted in August 2000 seems to be the only effort made to date to change the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* '''Canada'''&amp;nbsp;– Ferrets brought from anywhere except the US require a Permit to Import from the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] Animal Health Office. Ferrets from the US require only a vaccination certificate signed by a veterinarian. Ferrets under three months old are not subject to any import restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* '''European Union'''&amp;nbsp;– {{as of|2004|July}}, dogs, cats, and ferrets can travel freely within the European Union under the [[pet passport]] scheme. To cross a border within the EU, ferrets require at minimum an EU PETS passport and an identification microchip (though some countries will accept a tattoo instead). Vaccinations are required; most countries require a rabies vaccine, and some require a [[Canine distemper|distemper]] vaccine and treatment for ticks and fleas 24 to 48 hours before entry. Ferrets occasionally need to be quarantined before entering the country. PETS travel information is available from any EU veterinarian or on government websites.
* '''United Kingdom'''&amp;nbsp;– The UK accepts ferrets under the EU's PETS travel scheme. Ferrets must be microchipped, vaccinated against [[rabies]], and documented. They must be treated for ticks and tapeworms 24 to 48 hours before entry. They must also arrive via an authorized route. Ferrets arriving from outside the EU may be subject to a six-month quarantine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15666">The '''gates of horn and ivory''' are a [[Literature|literary]] image used to distinguish true [[dream]]s (corresponding to factual occurrences) from false. The phrase originated in the Greek language, in which the word for "horn" is similar to that for "fulfil" and the word for "ivory" is similar to that for "deceive". On the basis of that play on words, true dreams are spoken of as coming through the gates of horn, false dreams as coming through those of ivory.

==The Odyssey==
The earliest appearance of the image is in the [[Odyssey]], book 19, lines 560–569. There [[Penelope]], who has had a dream that seems to signify that her husband [[Odysseus]] is about to return, expresses by a play on words her conviction that the dream is false. She says:
:Stranger, dreams verily are baffling and unclear of meaning, and in no wise do they find fulfilment in all things for men. For two are the gates of shadowy dreams, and one is fashioned of ''horn'' and one of ''ivory''. Those dreams that pass through the gate of sawn ''ivory deceive'' men, bringing words that find no ''fulfilment''. But those that come forth through the gate of polished ''horn bring'' true issues ''to pass'', when any mortal sees them. But in my case it was not from thence, methinks, that my strange dream came.&lt;ref&gt;Translation from the [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HomerOdyssey19.html Loeb Classical Library edition]. The original text is:
:Ξεῖν’, ἦ τοι μὲν ὄνειροι ἀμήχανοι ἀκριτόμυθοι
:γίγνοντ’, οὐδέ τι πάντα τελείεται ἀνθρώποισι.
:δοιαὶ γάρ τε πύλαι ἀμενηνῶν εἰσὶν ὀνείρων·
:αἱ μὲν γὰρ κεράεσσι τετεύχαται, αἱ δ' ἐλέφαντι,
:τῶν οἳ μέν κ’ ἔλθωσι διὰ πριστοῦ ἐλέφαντος,
:οἵ ῥ’ ἐλεφαίρονται, ἔπε’ ἀκράαντα φέροντες·
:οἱ δὲ διὰ ξεστῶν κεράων ἔλθωσι θύραζε,
:οἵ ῥ’ ἔτυμα κραίνουσι, βροτῶν ὅτε κέν τις ἴδηται.
:ἀλλ’ ἐμοὶ οὐκ ἐντεῦθεν ὀΐομαι αἰνὸν ὄνειρον
:ἐλθέμεν·&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur T. Murray,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/HomerOdyssey1.html Text (without footnotes) of the 1919 Loeb translation]&lt;/ref&gt; translator of the original [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition of the Odyssey, commented:
:The play upon the words κέρας, "horn", and κραίνω, "fulfil", and upon ἐλέφας, "ivory", and ἐλεφαίρομαι, "deceive", cannot be preserved in English.&lt;ref&gt;Homer: The Odyssey, II (The Loeb Classical Library. First printed 1919; Reprinted 1925, 1928, 1931, 1940, 1942, 1946, 1953, 1960, 1966, 1975, 1980; American {{ISBN|0-674-99117-6}}; British {{ISBN|0-434-99105-8}}), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Echoes in later Greek literature==
Homer greatly influenced Greek literature as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Richard C. Jebb and A.T. Sinclair in Whibley (1905),[https://books.google.com/books?id=3hs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Companion to Greek Studies, p. 120]:
:Homeric influence is not only all-pervading in Greek literature, but enters also into every part of Greek life.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Plato]] refers to the two gates in his dialogue ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'':
:Socrates: "Listen then," I said, "to my dream, to see whether it comes through horn or through ivory."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeplato|Charmides|173a|gr}}:
:ἄκουε δή, ἔφην, τὸ ἐμὸν ὄναρ, εἴτε διὰ κεράτων εἴτε δι᾽ ἐλέφαντος ἐλήλυθεν.&lt;/ref&gt;
A reference to the Odyssean image also appears in the late (c. AD 400) epic poet [[Nonnus]]:
:As Morpheus slept, the vision of a dream cajoled him,
:beguiling his mind after flitting through the gates of ivory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veritatis-societas.org/203_CSHB/0390-0429,_Nonnos,_Dionysiacorum_Libri_XLVIII_(CSHB),_GR.pdf Dionysiaca, 34:89-90]
:Μοῤῥέα δ' ὑπνώοντα παρήφανεν ὄψις ὀνείρου,
:κλεψινόων ἐλέφαντος ἀναΐξασα πυλάων.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Aeneid==
[[Virgil]] borrowed the image of the two gates in lines 893–898 of Book 6 of his ''[[Aeneid]]'', describing that of horn as the passageway for true shadows&lt;ref&gt;In the original, "veris umbris", but translated by Dryden as "true visions"&lt;/ref&gt; and that of ivory as that through which the [[Manes]] in the [[Greek underworld|underworld]] send false dreams up to the living.&lt;ref&gt;altera candenti perfecta nitens elephanto,&lt;br&gt;
sed falsa ad caelum mittunt insomnia Manes.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the latter gate Virgil makes his hero [[Aeneas]], accompanied by the [[Cumaean Sibyl]], return from his visit to the underworld, where he has met, among others, his dead father [[Anchises]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Two gates the silent house of Sleep adorn;
&lt;br&gt;Of polish'd ivory this, that of transparent horn:
&lt;br&gt;True visions thro' transparent horn arise;
&lt;br&gt;Thro' polish'd ivory pass deluding lies.
&lt;br&gt;Of various things discoursing as he pass'd,
&lt;br&gt;Anchises hither bends his steps at last.
&lt;br&gt;Then, thro' the gate of iv'ry, he dismiss'd
&lt;br&gt;His valiant offspring and divining guest.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.6.vi.html translation] given here is by [[John Dryden]] (cf. [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Aeneid/Book_VI?match=la Wikisource]). The original text is:
:Sunt geminae Somni portae, quarum altera fertur
:cornea, qua veris facilis datur exitus umbris;
:altera candenti perfecta nitens elephanto,
:sed falsa ad caelum mittunt insomnia Manes.
:his ubi tum natum Anchises unaque Sibyllam
:prosequitur dictis portaque emittit eburna ...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Why Virgil has Aeneas return through the ivory gate (whence pass deluding lies)&lt;ref&gt;"falsa insomnia" (literally, false dreams)&lt;/ref&gt; and not through that of horn is uncertain. One theory is that it refers to the time of night at which he returned.&lt;ref&gt;
Nicholas Reed, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/638188 The Gates of Sleep in Aeneid 6]'', The Classical Quarterly, New Series, Vol. 23, No. 2 (Nov., 1973), pp. 311-315&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jorge Luis Borges]] accepted the view that, for Virgil, what we call reality is not in fact such; that Virgil may have considered the [[Plato]]nic world of the archetypes to be the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Borges made this remark in a lecture that he gave in Buenos Aires in the mid-1970s on the subject of nightmares. The transcription of the lecture is included in English translation in [https://books.google.com/books?id=ty8LLZ_U93MC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=borges+ivory+horn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CdePhbdKFP&amp;sig=2eii_2JRE5UzrwQG1JBzQ3SHDbU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Q75xTuXCN4KWhQfXgqHQCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Jorge Luis Borges, ''Seven Nights''] (see pp. 30-31) and in [https://books.google.com/books?id=8EMSAEfXzk0C&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=borges+ivory+horn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nJdavqjeeJ&amp;sig=oDbqmAwyhjEK1J3BK5KH6fYKZFU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Q75xTuXCN4KWhQfXgqHQCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Jorge Luis Borges, ''Everything and Nothing''] (see p. 83).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation is that Virgil is thus indicating that what he has recounted is not to be taken as literal fact. In [[John Wesley]]'s last sermon, preached on 17 January 1791, he spoke of how uncertain even the best conjectures about the invisible world were without revelation: "The most finished of all these accounts, is that of the great Roman poet. Where observe how warily he begins, with that apologetic preface, – Sit mihi fas audita loqui – 'May I be allowed to tell what I have heard'. And, in the conclusion, lest anyone should imagine he believed any of these accounts, he sends the relater of them out of hades by the ivory gate, through which, he had just informed us, that only dreams and shadows pass, – a very plain intimation, that all which has gone before, is to be looked upon as a dream!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://wesley.nnu.edu/john-wesley/the-sermons-of-john-wesley-1872-edition/sermon-122-on-faith/ John Wesley, Sermon 122, On Faith]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Latin writing==
In his ''Silvae'' V iii 285–290, a lament for his dead father, the poet [[Statius|Publius Papinius Statius]], expresses the wish that his father may come to him from the abode of the dead in the form of a true dream, passing therefore through the gate of horn:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thence mayst thou pass to where the better gate of horn o'ercomes the envious ivory, and in the semblance of a dream teach me what thou wert wont to teach.&lt;ref&gt;English translation by J. H. Mozley  -  Loeb Classic Library (Harvard University  Press). Statius's words are:
:inde tamen venias, melior qua porta malignum
:cornea vincit ebur, somnique in imagine monstra,
:quae solitus.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 15th century Latin poet Basinio of Parma, employed at the court of [[Sigismondo Malatesta]] in Rimini, wrote a panegyric epic poem for his prince (''Hesperis'') modelled largely on the ''Aeneid'' and the Homeric epics, in which Sigismondo, as epic hero, undertakes a journey to the underworld in order to meet his deceased father Pandolfo Malatesta. Before that he passes the temple of Fama which has a bipartite gate, one half made of horn, one of ivory. On the ivory half not only Sigismondo's descent but also the ones by Hercules, Theseus, Ulysses and Aeneas are depicted.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Having seen that, they turn towards the astounding temple of Fame, a temple enormous and imposing in size and shape, whose door on its left side is white from ivory steps with shining horn on the other half. Disturbing nightmares are conveyed by false rumour on the vain gates of ivory, while true dreams of horn are sent by trustworthy rumours. The gate of horn shows the Spaniards defeated on the Tyrrhenian shore [i.e. Sigismondo's victory over Alfonso's V. troops at Piombino in 1448]. On the ivory steps Sigismondo turns toward the sea, and is swimming after his ship is destroyed [on his way to the island where he is to undertake his trip to the underworld]. There Theseus and also Hercules made their way: there brave and victorious Ulysses went to the gloomy homes of the Cimmerians; there faithful Aeneas took to the Stygian lake Avernus." &lt;br /&gt;
Basinio's Latin text is as follows:
:Haec ubi visa, petunt famae mirabile templum,
:templum augustum immane horrens, cui limen eburnis
:canebat gradibus laeva de parte ; nitebant
:parte alia cornu solido loca. Falsa elephanti
:fama refert vanis insomnia turbida portis,
:somnia vera ferunt non vanae cornua famae.
:Cornea dejectos Tyrrheno in litore Iberos
:porta docet templi. Gradibus Sismundus eburnis
:tendit ad Oceanum, et fracta natat alta carina.
:Hac iter Aegides, nec non Tyrinthius heros
:Taenarias legere vias : hac durus Ulysses
:Cimmerium obscuras victor concessit ad Arces ;
:hac pius Aeneas Stygio se immisit Averno. (''Hesperis XIII 205-217)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==English writing==

The gates of horn and ivory appear in the following notable English written works:
*[[David Gemmell]]'s epic novel "[[Troy: Lord of the Silver Bow]]", chapter sixteen. This is referenced when Odysseus talks to Xander about his vision of the future, and what his wife Penelope had taught him about dreams and their gates in the past on page 268.
*[[Edmund Spenser]]'s epic poem "[[The Faery Queene]]" (1590, English) in book 1, stanzas XL and XLIV, in reference to a false dream being brought to the hero (Prince Arthur/the Knight of the Red Crosse).
*[[Alexander Pope]]'s mock-epic [[The Dunciad]] (1743), in Book III: "And thro' the Iv'ry Gate the Vision flies."
*[[E. R. Eddison]]'s romance ''[[The Worm Ouroboros]]'' (1922), in Chapter 2: "...belike the dream was a true dream, sent thee through the gate of horn".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/ring/two/two08.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[E. M. Forster]]'s short story ''[[The Other Side of the Hedge]]''. The reference from Forster comes when the main character of the story observes the two gates; ''The Other Side of the Hedge'' is usually read as a metaphor of death and [[Heaven]].
*[[T.S. Eliot]]'s poem "Sweeney Among the Nightingales". The line "And Sweeney guards the horned gate" is likewise a reference to this image.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Norton and Peters Rushton, Classical Myths in English Literature 183-84 (1952).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Eliot's poem [[Ash-Wednesday]]. The lines "And the blind eye creates / The empty forms between the ivory gates" similarly refer to this concept.
*[[William Empson]]'s poem 'Letter III': '...offspring of Heaven first born, | Earth's terra firma, the Hell-Gate of Horn'
*[[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s story, "[[The Doom that Came to Sarnath]]", as a set of magnificent ivory gates, carved from one piece of ivory stood at the entrance of a city of vain humans, which seems to be taken from [[Lord Dunsany]]'s story "The Idle Days on the Yann". It is also mentioned as a passage to the realm of hallucinations in Lovecraft's "[[Celephaïs]]".
*[[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s novel ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]''
*[[Neil Gaiman]]'s graphic novel series ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]''.  The gates themselves were crafted from the horns and bones of gods that attempted to take over the Dreaming, the domain of Dream of the Endless.  With the help of a woman made of light named Alianora, Dream defeated the gods and used their remains to create the gates and his battle-helm.
*[[Robert Holdstock]]'s novel ''[[Gate of Ivory, Gate of Horn]]''.  In the Holdstock novel, the main character grapples with a traumatic event that has two very different manifestations, one true and one false.
*[[Derek Mahon]]'s poem "Homage to Malcolm Lowry". "Lighting-blind, you, tempest-torn / At the poles of our condition, did not confuse / The Gates of Ivory with the Gates of Horn."&lt;ref&gt;Mahon, Derek. The Snow Party. London: Oxford University Press, 1975. "Homage to Malcolm Lowry" is the 3rd poem in this anthology.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Margaret Drabble]]'s novel ''The Gates of Ivory''
*[[W.H. Auden]]'s poem "[[Horae Canonicae]]"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3933">'''Green Power Usage Effectiveness''' (GPUE) is a proposed measurement of both how much [[sustainable energy]] a computer [[data center]] uses, its [[carbon footprint]] per usable [[kilowatt hour]] (kWh) and how efficiently it uses its power; specifically, how much of the power is actually used by the computing equipment (in contrast to cooling and other overhead). It is an addition to the [[power usage effectiveness]] (PUE) definition and was first proposed by [[Greenqloud]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greenqloud.com/greenpowerusageeffectiveness-gpue/ GPUE – Green Power Usage Effectiveness - GreenQloud]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Green Grid]] has developed the Power Usage Effectiveness metric &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreengrid.org/sitecore/content/Global/Content/white-papers/The-Green-Grid-Data-Center-Power-Efficiency-Metrics-PUE-and-DCiE.aspx The Green Grid - The Green Grid Data Center Power Efficiency Metrics: PUE and DCiE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217182325/http://thegreengrid.org/sitecore/content/Global/Content/white-papers/The-Green-Grid-Data-Center-Power-Efficiency-Metrics-PUE-and-DCiE.aspx |date=2009-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or PUE to measure a data centers' effectiveness of getting power to IT equipment. What the PUE tells in simple terms is how much extra energy is needed for each usable kWh for the IT equipment due to the power going into cooling, power distribution loss etc. and it’s a simple formula (in theory):

PUE = Total Facility Power/IT Equipment Power

The PUE can change depending on where measurements are made, when they are made and the timespan the measurements are made in.
Data centers are subtracting factors from their PUE to lower it e.g. district heating. Some of the issues with PUE are being addressed with the PUEx definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serverproblemsolved.com/itprimers/pue-power-usage-effectiveness-metrics-data-center-energy-efficiency-green-grid/ New PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) standards for data center energy efficiency]&lt;/ref&gt;

GPUE is a way to "weigh" the PUE to better see which data centers are truly green in the sense that they indirectly cause the least amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be emitted by their use of sustainable or unsustainable energy sources.

This new metric GPUE or Green Power Usage Effectiveness is defined as:

GPUE = G × PUEx (for inline comparison of data centers)&lt;br&gt;
or = G @ PUEx  (a better display and for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission calculations)

The "G" is the key factor here and it is a simple calculated value:

G = Weighed sum of energy sources and their lifecycle KG CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/KWh

G =∑( %EnergySource × ( 1 + weight) )

Adding 1 to the weight is to "weigh" (multiply) with the PUE to get a number that is comparable to PUE. The weights taken directly from the "lifecycle CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh for electricity generation by power source" table above we got from the 2008 Sovacool Study &lt;ref&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. A Critical Evaluation of Nuclear Power and Renewable Electricity in Asia, ''Journal of Contemporary Asia'', Vol. 40, No. 3, August 2010, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;  e.g. the weight for unscrubbed coal is e.g. 1.050 (kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh) while hydroelectric river generation has a weight of 0.013. An unknown energy source or a "mix" will get the same as the maximum value which for now is the same as coal.

Example:

PUE 1.20, 50/50 Coal/Hydro&lt;br&gt;
G = 0.5*(1+1.050) + 0.5*(1+0.013)&lt;br&gt;
G = 1.531, GPUEx = 1.84 or 1.531@1.20

Kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per usable kWh = (G-1) × PUEx = 0.64&amp;nbsp;kg

'''Hume's fork''' is an explanation, developed by later [[philosopher]]s, of [[David Hume]]'s 1730s division of "relations of ideas" from "matters of fact and real existence".&lt;ref name=Flew&gt;[[Antony Flew]], ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=Hume's+fork p 156].&lt;/ref&gt;  A distinction is made between [[Modal logic|necessary]] versus [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] (concerning reality), {{nowrap|''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]''}} versus {{nowrap|''[[a posteriori]]''}} (concerning knowledge), and [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]] versus [[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]] (concerning language). Relations of abstract ideas align on one side (necessary, ''a priori'', analytic), whereas concrete truths align on the other (contingent, ''a posteriori'', synthetic).&lt;ref name=Flew/&gt;

The "necessary" is generally true in all [[possible world]]s—usually by mere logical [[Validity (logic)|validity]]—whereas the "contingent" hinges on the way the real world is.  The ''a priori'' is knowable before or without, whereas the ''a posteriori'' is knowable only after or through, experience in an area of interest. The "analytic" is a statement true by virtue of its terms' meanings, and therefore a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—necessarily true but uninformative—whereas the "synthetic" is true by its terms' [[semantics|meanings]] in relation to a state of facts. In other words, analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rey|first=Georges|title=The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition)|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers have used the terms differently, and there is debate over whether there is a legitimate distinction. 

==History&lt;!--'Kant's pitchfork' redirects here--&gt;==
Hume's strong [[empiricism]], as in Hume's fork as well as Hume's [[problem of induction]], was taken as a threat to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s theory of motion.  [[Immanuel Kant]] responded with [[rationalism]] in his 1781 ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', where Kant attributed to the mind a causal role in sensory experience by the mind's aligning the environmental input by arranging those [[sense data]] into the experience of space and time.  Kant thus reasoned existence of the synthetic ''a priori''—combining meanings of terms with states of facts, yet known true without experience of the particular instance—replacing the two prongs of Hume's fork with a three-pronged-fork thesis ('''Kant's pitchfork'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Robert, ''Kant and the Foundations of Analytic Philosophy''. Clarendon Press, 2004. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus saving [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]].

[[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|In 1919]], Newton's theory fell to Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]]. In the late 1920s, the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] rejected Kant's synthetic ''a priori'' and asserted Hume's fork, so called, while hinging it at language—the analytic/synthetic division—while presuming that by holding to analyticity, they could develop a [[logical syntax]] entailing, as a consequence of Hume's fork, both necessity and aprioricity, thus restricting science to claims [[verificationism|verifiable]] as either [[truth value|false or true]].  In the early 1950s, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] undermined the analytic/synthetic division by explicating [[ontological relativity]], as every term in any statement has its meaning contingent on a vast network of knowledge and belief, the speaker's conception of the entire world.  By the early 1970s, [[Saul Kripke]] established the necessary ''a posteriori'', since if the [[Venus|Morning Star]] and the [[Venus|Evening Star]] are the same star, they are the same star by necessity, but this is known true by a human only through relevant experience.

Hume's fork remains basic in Anglo-American philosophy.  Many deceptions and confusions are foisted by surreptitious or unwitting conversion of a synthetic claim to an analytic claim, rendered true by necessity but merely a tautology, for instance the [[No true Scotsman|''No true Scotsman'' move]].  Simply put, Hume's fork has limitations. Related concerns are Hume's distinction of demonstrative versus probable reasoning&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin &amp; Jiyuan Yu. "Hume's Fork".  ''Blackwell's Dictionary of Western Philosophy''.  Blackwell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrett Thomson, ''Bacon to Kant: An Introduction to Modern Philosophy'', 2nd Edition, p 218.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hume's law]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin and Jiyuan Yu. "Hume's Fork". ''Blackwell's Dictionary of Western Philosophy''. Blackwell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume makes other, important two-category distinctions, such as [[David Hume#Practical reason|beliefs versus desires]] and as impressions versus ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Section II.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations of ideas and matters of fact==

The first distinction is between two different areas of human study:

:All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, ''relations of ideas'', and ''matters of fact''. Of the first kind are the sciences of [[Geometry]], [[Algebra]], and [[Arithmetic]] ...'' [which are] ''discoverable by the mere operation of thought ... Matters of fact, which are the second object of human reason, are not ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature with the foregoing.
::: — ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''&lt;ref&gt; ''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Section IV, Part I.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's fork is often stated in such a way that statements are divided up into two types:

* Statements about ideas. These are [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]], [[Modal logic|necessary]], and [[knowledge|knowable]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''.
* Statements about the world. These are synthetic, [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]], and knowable ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]''.

In modern terminology, members of the first group are known as [[analytic proposition]]s and members of the latter as [[synthetic proposition]]s. This terminology comes from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (Introduction to ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', Section IV).

Into the first class fall statements such as ''"all bodies are extended"'', ''"all bachelors are unmarried"'', and truths of mathematics and logic. Into the second class fall statements like ''"the sun rises in the morning"'', and ''"all bodies have mass"''.

Hume wants to prove that [[certainty]] does not exist in science.  First, Hume notes that statements of the second type can never be entirely certain, due to the fallibility of our senses, the possibility of deception (see e.g. the modern [[brain in a vat]] theory) and other arguments made by philosophical skeptics. It is always logically possible that any given statement about the world is false.

Second, Hume claims that our belief in cause-and-effect relationships between events is not grounded on reason, but rather arises merely by habit or custom. Suppose one states: "Whenever someone on earth lets go of a stone it falls." While we can grant that in every instance thus far when a rock was dropped on Earth it went down, this does not make it logically necessary that in the future rocks will fall when in the same circumstances. Things of this nature rely upon the future conforming to the same principles which governed the past. But that isn't something that we can know based on past experience—all past experience could tell us is that in the past, the future has resembled the past.

Third, Hume notes that relations of ideas can be used only to prove other relations of ideas, and mean nothing outside of the context of how they relate to each other, and therefore tell us nothing about the world. Take the statement "An equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length." While some earlier philosophers (most notably [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]]) held that logical statements such as these contained the most formal reality, since they are always true and unchanging, Hume held that, while true, they contain no formal reality, because the truth of the statements rests on the definitions of the words involved, and not on actual things in the world, since there is no such thing as a true triangle or exact equality of length in the world. So for this reason, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact.

The results claimed by Hume as consequences of his fork are drastic. According to him, relations of ideas can be proved with certainty (by using other relations of ideas), however, they don't really mean anything about the world. Since they don't mean anything about the world, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact. Because of this, matters of fact have no certainty and therefore cannot be used to prove anything. Only certain things can be used to prove other things for certain, but only things about the world can be used to prove other things about the world. But since we can't cross the fork, nothing is both certain and about the world, only one or the other, and so it is impossible to prove something about the world with certainty.

If accepted, Hume's fork makes it pointless to try to prove the [[existence of God]] (for example) as a matter of fact. If God is not literally made up of physical matter, and does not have an observable effect on the world, making a statement about God is not a matter of fact. Therefore, a statement about God must be a relation of ideas. In this case if we prove the statement "God exists," it doesn't really tell us anything about the world; it is just playing with words. It is easy to see how Hume's fork voids the causal argument and the [[ontological argument]] for the existence of a non-observable God. However, this does not mean that the validity of Hume's fork would imply that God definitely does not exist, only that it would imply that the existence of God cannot be proven as a matter of fact without worldly evidence. 

Hume rejected the idea of any meaningful statement that did not fall into this schema, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If we take in our hand any volume; of [[divinity]] or school [[metaphysics]], for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but [[sophistry]] and illusion.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=166|ps=, emphasis removed}} — ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''

IES is a [[Business networking|network-based organization]] which brings together scientists, artists, engineers and specialists from Latvia and abroad.

IES research projects&lt;ref name="IES projects"&gt;[http://www.videsinstituts.lv/en/projects IES research projects]&lt;/ref&gt; are aimed to develop innovative [[Terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial]] and [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] ecosystem status assessment and elaborate [[Sustainability|sustainable]] management [[Solution concept|solutions]].

The main research themes of IES: mapping and assessment of [[land cover/land use]]; mapping and status assessment of habitats of [[European Union]] (EU) importance based on [[Habitats Directive|The Habitats Directive]];&lt;ref name="Habitat Directive"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:31992L0043&amp;from=EN European Council Habitat Directive]. European Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora.&lt;/ref&gt; detection and assessment of [[invasive species]]; mapping and assessment of [[Forest|forest resources]]; assessment of forest [[vitality]]; [[landscape planning]] and management; detection and assessment of [[Archaeological site|archaeological]] [[Cultural heritage|heritage]]; holistic assessment and [[Stream restoration|restoration of aquatic ecosystems]]; mapping and assessment of waterbody depth and [[sediment]]s; research of [[fish migration]] and natural reproduction; [[wildlife]] mapping and modelling; future [[satellite]] simulation.

== Technologies ==

The institute has considerable expertise in the application of advanced airborne [[remote sensing]] for [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental assessment]] and the [[Natural resource management|management of natural resources]]. IES has developed a unique [http://www.videsinstituts.lv/en/flying-laboratory/airborne-surveillance-and-environmental-monitoring-system Airborne Surveillance and Environmental Monitoring System ARSENAL]. The system integrates eight mutually operable [[sensor]]s which provide high quality data on the terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems, their structure, [[chemical composition]] and [[Spatial analysis|spatial characteristics]].

ARSENAL is embedded in the research [[aircraft]] BN-2T-4S [[Britten-Norman Defender|Defender]].

== Main activities ==

Institute for Environmental Solutions (IES) will implement two [[satellite]] [[simulation]] projects as part of the [[European Space Agency|European Space Agency’s]] (ESA) programme „The Plan for European Co-operating States”.&lt;ref name="PECS"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Plan_for_European_Cooperating_States/General_overview2 The Plan for European Cooperating States (PECS) web site]&lt;/ref&gt; The first project proposes to simulate the [[Sentinel-2|Sentinel – 2]] satellite for the improvement of [[land cover/land use]] monitoring while the second project proposes to simulate the [[Sentinel-3|Sentinel – 3]] satellite for the analysis of optically complex coastal waters such as the [[Baltic Sea]].

IES has been assessing the [[ecology]] of the [[Baltic Sea]] since 2010. As a part of the MARMONI project,&lt;ref name="MARMONI"&gt;[http://marmoni.balticseaportal.net/wp/ MARMONI project web site]. Project title: Innovative approaches for marine biodiversity monitoring and assessment of conservation status of nature values in the Baltic Sea (Acronym - MARMONI).&lt;/ref&gt; the institute researched the [[chlorophyll]] concentration in the [[Gulf of Riga]] and Swedish coastline. The airborne remote sensing has been tested and proven its usefulness in [[HELCOM]] Balex Delta&lt;ref name="Balex Delta"&gt;[http://helcom.fi/action-areas/response-to-spills/helcom-balex-delta-and-other-exercises/ International training of marine monitoring HELCOM Balex Delta.]&lt;/ref&gt; and CEPCO North&lt;ref name="Cepco North"&gt;[http://helcom.fi/news/Pages/Regular-aerial-surveillance-reduces-illegal-discharges-in-the-Baltic-Sea.aspx International training towards detecting pollution in the Baltic Sea CEPCO North.]&lt;/ref&gt; international training towards detecting pollution in the Baltic Sea.

IES has built its expertise in the lake fish [[Quantification (science)|quantification]] by cooperating with the world leading experts in the area, such as the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]] and [[Finnish Environment Institute]] (SYKE); IES has been responsible for Latvia’s first-ever holistic [[lake ecosystem]] and status surveying in [[Lake Burtnieks]]; [[Lake Alūksne]]; Lake Sāviena; [[Āraiši lake dwelling site|Lake Āraiši]]. The holistic approach involves the analysis of [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], [[zoobenthos]], [[freshwater biology]], status of fish population, as well as the measurement and assessment of lake overgrowth, lake depth and [[sediment]]s through the use of [[ground-penetrating radar]]&lt;ref name="GPR"&gt;[http://www.videsinstituts.lv/en/flying-laboratory/ground-penetrating-radar-gpr Description of IES's Ground Penetrating Radar]&lt;/ref&gt; and modelling the [[nutrient cycle]] in the lake ecosystem.

Since 2012 IES has been helping the [http://www.daba.gov.lv/public/eng/projects/est_lat_rus1/nca/ Nature Conservation Agency] to fight illegal fishing. By using [[Thermographic camera|thermal]] airborne remote sensing IES is able to identify [[illegal fishing]] activities near public lakes, rivers and coastal areas in Latvia.&lt;ref name="Geograpfy of Lavia"&gt;[[Geography of Latvia|Geography and geographic features of Latvia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

IES has been testing and adapting an innovative airborne remote sensing approach for the mapping and status assessment of protected [[habitat]]s of EU importance&lt;ref name="Habitat Directive"/&gt; within and beyond the specially protected nature territories in Latvia.&lt;ref name="Protected territories"&gt;[http://www.daba.gov.lv/public/eng/protected_areas/ Specially protected territories in Latvia]&lt;/ref&gt; IES is mapping such habitats as coastal and inland [[dune]]s, [[moorland]], [[scrubland]], [[grassland]], [[wetland]] and [[forest]] [[habitat]]s.

By cooperating with [http://www.befgroup.net/ Baltic Environmental Forum] and as a part of two international projects Grass Service&lt;ref name="Grass Service"&gt;[http://grassservice.balticgrasslands.eu/en/ Grass Service project web site]. Project title: Alternative use of biomass for maintenance of grassland biodiversity and ecosystem service (Acronym – Grass Service)&lt;/ref&gt; and Viva Grass&lt;ref name="Viva Grass"&gt;[http://vivagrass.eu/ Viva Grass project web site]. Project title: Integrated planning tool to ensure viability of grasslands (Acronym - Viva Grass)&lt;/ref&gt; IES has carried out the mapping and status assessment of High Nature Value [[grassland]]s.&lt;ref name="Grassland habitats"&gt;[http://nat-programme.daba.gov.lv/public/eng/habitats/grasslands/ Grassland habitats in Latvia]. National Conservation and Management Programme for Natura 2000 sites in Latvia.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 to 2013 cooperating with [[Riga Technical University]], IES developed new solutions for mapping the distribution and calculation of [[biomass]] of the Giant Hogweed (''[[Heracleum sosnowskyi]]'').

'''Inversive activities''' are processes which self internalise the action concerned. For example, a person who has an Inversive personality [[Internalization|internalises]] his [[emotion]]s from any exterior source. An inversive heat source would be a heat source where all the heat remains within the object and is not subject to any format of [[transference]] or [[externalisation]].

Is the opposite of Transversive activities and objects which suggest by their very nature that the outcome is transferred to the [[secondary source]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2923">'''John Edward Jacob''' (born 1934 in [[Trout, Louisiana]]) was a [[United States of America|U.S.]] [[civil rights]] leader.  He served as the president of the [[National Urban League]] between 1982 and 1994.

Jacob received his B.A. and M.A. degrees from [[Howard University]] and was a [[social worker]] in [[Baltimore]] before joining the Urban League.  In 1965, he became director of education and youth incentives at the [[Washington, D.C.]] chapter.  Later he served as president and executive director of the San Diego Urban League.  In 1979 he became executive vice-president of the national office under [[Vernon Jordan]], whom he succeeded as president.

During his tenure as Urban League president, Jacob fought cutbacks in federal social programs and the weakening of civil rights enforcement under the [[Reagan Administration]].  In particular, he objected to the appointment of a conservative majority to the Civil Rights Commission that was hostile to vigorous protection of [[civil rights]], as well as the Justice Department's prosecutions of other public agencies engaged in affirmative action.

==Urban Marshall Plan==

In the early 1980s, Jacob helped develop a plan for urban recovery similar to the 1947 [[Marshall Plan]] initiated to assist European nations after World War II. Aid was sought from private sectors to facilitate entry-level job training programs, and Jacob proposed the League give direct assistance from its own resources to poverty-stricken minorities and whites, including housing and job placement. In addition, he recommended the federal government institute full employment through substantial public works and job training programs, and along with other civil rights groups, supported economic pressure in the corporate world to develop markets and jobs for minorities.

The son of a Baptist minister, Jacob was also an adherent of self-help.  He promoted [[SAT]] tutoring, comprehensive teenage pregnancy prevention, and a male responsibility program for fatherhood, to address issues contributing to the cycle of poverty in the [[African-American]] community.  Jacob added voter registration, education, and drug control to the League's agenda of priorities.

In contrast to Reagan, [[George H.W. Bush]] was initially receptive to Jacob's domestic Marshall Plan proposal, and Jacob welcomed dialogue with the new administration.  But Bush's veto of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1990]] soured the relationship.  The early 1990s also saw new court decisions and conservative political pressure against affirmative action policies the Urban League supported.

(Alonzo Rodriguez, 16th century, Museo Regionale di [[Messina]]).]]
The '''kiss of peace''' is an ancient traditional [[Christianity|Christian]] [[greeting]], sometimes also called the "holy kiss", "brother kiss" (among men), or "sister kiss" (among women). Such greetings signify a wish and blessing that [[peace]] be with the recipient, and besides their spontaneous uses they have certain [[ritualized]] or formalized uses long established in [[liturgy]]. Many denominations use other forms of greeting (besides literal [[kiss]]es) to serve equivalent purposes; they include [[handshake]]s, [[gesture]]s, and [[hug]]s, any of which may be called a '''sign of peace'''. 

==Sources==
It was the widespread custom in the ancient western [[Mediterranean]] for men to greet each other with a [[kiss]].&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, Smith's Bible Dictionary, [http://biblehub.com/topical/k/kiss.htm Kiss], UK, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; That was also the custom in ancient [[Judea]] and practiced also by Christians.

However, the [[New Testament]]'s references to a [[Sacred|holy]] kiss ({{lang-gr|εν αγιω φιληματι}}, ''en philemati hagio'') and kiss of [[love]] (''en philemati [[agapē]]s'') transformed the character of the act beyond a greeting. Such a kiss is mentioned five times in the concluding section of letters in the New Testament:

* [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] {{bibleverse-nb||Romans|16:16|NIV}} — "Greet one another with a holy kiss" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσπάσασθε ἀλλήλους ἐν φιλήματι ἁγίῳ}}).
* [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Corinthians|16:20|NIV}} — "Greet one another with a holy kiss" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσπάσασθε ἀλλήλους ἐν φιλήματι ἁγίῳ}}).
* [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|2 Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb|2|Corinthians|13:12|NIV}} — "Greet one another with a holy kiss" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσπάσασθε ἀλλήλους ἐν ἁγίῳ φιλήματι}}).
* [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|I Thessalonians]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Thessalonians|5:26|NIV}} — "Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσπάσασθε τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς πάντας ἐν φιλήματι ἁγίῳ}}).
* [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Peter|5:14|NIV}} — "Greet one another with a kiss of love" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσπάσασθε ἀλλήλους ἐν φιλήματι ἀγάπης}}).

It has been noted that these mentions of the holy kiss come at the end of these epistles. Since these epistles were addressed to Christian communities they would most probably have been read in the context of their communal worship. If the assemblies for worship already concluded in a celebration of the [[Eucharist]] the holy kiss would already have occurred in the position it would later occupy in most ancient Christian liturgical tradition (with the exception of the Roman Rite), namely after the proclamation of the Word and at the beginning of the celebration of the Eucharist.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

The writings of the early church fathers speak of the holy kiss, which they call "a sign of peace", which was already part of the [[Eucharist]]ic [[liturgy]], occurring after the [[Lord's Prayer]] in the [[Roman Rite]] and the rites directly derived from it. [[St. Augustine]], for example, speaks of it in one of his Easter Sermons: {{Quotation|Then, after the consecration of the Holy Sacrifice of God, because He wished us also to be His sacrifice, a fact which was made clear when the Holy Sacrifice was first instituted, and because that Sacrifice is a sign of what we are,  behold,  when the Sacrifice is finished, we say the Lord's Prayer which  you have received and recited. After this, the 'Peace be with you’ is said, and the Christians embrace one another with the holy kiss. This is a sign of peace; as the lips indicate, let  peace be made in your conscience, that is, when your lips  draw near to those of your brother, do not let your heart  withdraw from his. Hence, these are great and powerful sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;SERMON 227, ''The Fathers of the Church'',(1959), Roy Joseph Deferrari, Genera editor, ''Sermons on the Liturgical Seasons'', vol. 38, p. 197. [https://archive.org/details/fathersofthechur009512mbp] See also: Sermon 227 in ''The Works of Saint Augustine: A New Translation for the 21st Century'', (1993), Vol. 6, part, 3, p. 255. {{ISBN|1-56548-050-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Augustine's Sermon 227 is just one of several early Christian primary sources, both textual and iconographic (i.e., in works of art) providing clear evidence that the "kiss of peace" as practiced in the Christian liturgy was customarily exchanged for the first several centuries, not mouth to cheek, but mouth to mouth (note that men were separated from women during the liturgy) for, as the primary sources also show, this is how early Christians believed Christ and his followers exchanged their own kiss. For example, In his ''Paschale carmen'' (ca. 425-50), Latin priest-poet Sedulius condemns Judas and his betrayal of Christ with a kiss thus, "And leading that sacrilegious mob with its menacing swords and spikes, you press your mouth against his, and infuse your poison into his honey?"&lt;ref&gt;For a documented discussion of the mouth-to-mouth early Christian kiss of peace, see Franco Mormando, "Just as your lips approach the lips of yours brothers: Judas Iscariot and the Kiss of Betrayal," in ''Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio and the Baroque Image,'' ed. F. Mormando (Chestnut Hill, MA: McMullen Museum of Boston College, 1999), pp.179-190.&lt;/ref&gt; The '''kiss of peace''' was known in Greek from an early date as ''eirḗnē'' ({{lang|grc|εἰρήνη}}) ("peace", which became ''pax'' in Latin and peace in English).&lt;ref name=CathEncl&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] - [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08663a.htm Kiss]&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the peace greeting is probably from the common Hebrew greeting [[shalom]]; and the greeting "Peace be with you" is similarly a translation of the Hebrew [[shalom aleichem]]. In the [[Gospels]], both greetings were used by [[Jesus]] - e.g. {{bibleverse||Luke|24:36|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||John|20:21|NIV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|20:26|NIV}}. The Latin term translated as "sign of peace" is simply ''pax'' ("peace"), not ''signum pacis'' ("sign of peace") nor ''osculum pacis'' ("kiss of peace"). So the invitation by the deacon, or in his absence by the priest, "Let us offer each other the sign of peace", is in Latin: ''Offerte vobis pacem'' ("Offer each other peace" or "Offer each other the peace").

From an early date, to guard against any abuse of this form of salutation, women and men were required to sit separately, and the kiss of peace was given only by women to women and by men to men.&lt;ref name=CathEncl /&gt;

==In the Church==
The practice remains a part of the worship in traditional churches, including the Episcopal Church,&lt;ref&gt;Book of Common Prayer, 1979; &lt;/ref&gt;[[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox churches]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox churches]]; some liturgical mainline [[Christian denominations|Protestant denominations]]; and [[Spiritual Christian]], where it is often called the '''kiss of peace''', '''sign of peace''', '''Holy kiss''' or simply '''peace''' or '''pax''';  It is practiced as a part of worship in many Anabaptist heritage groups including [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], and [[Apostolic Christian]].

==Contemporary practices==

=== Catholic Church ===
In the [[Catholic Church]], the term now used is not "the kiss of peace", but "the sign of peace" or "the rite of peace". The ''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'' states: "There follows the Rite of Peace, by which the Church entreats peace and unity for herself and for the whole human family, and the faithful express to each other their ecclesial communion and mutual charity before communicating in the Sacrament."&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 82&lt;/ref&gt; The priest says or sings: "The peace of the Lord be with you always", to which the people respond: "And with your spirit." Then, as stated in the Roman Missal, "if appropriate, the Deacon, or the Priest, adds: 'Let us offer each other the sign of peace.'"&lt;ref name=RM&gt;Roman Missal, Order of Mass, 127–128&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Rite]], it is placed after the [[Pater Noster]] and before the [[Fractio panis (liturgy)|Fractio Panis]]. Even within the Catholic Church, there are [[Latin liturgical rites|liturgical rites]] (the [[Ambrosian Rite]] and the [[Mozarabic Rite]]) in which it is placed after the Liturgy of the Word, before the gifts for consecration are put on the altar. The latter placing is influenced by the recommendation in {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:23–24}} about seeking reconciliation with another before completing an offering at the altar. It was a practice in Rome itself at the time of [[Justin Martyr]] in the middle of the 2nd century. In the 3rd century the present placing was chosen not only in Rome but also in other parts of the West such as [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]], where [[Saint Augustine]] understood it as related to the petition, "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us", in the Lord's Prayer and to the link between being in communion with the body of Christ understood as the Church and receiving communion with the body of Christ in the Eucharist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6e6LZrH1WXgC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=Irwin+%22sign+of+peace%22+Augustine&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0kklVPP9LsiV7AbZwIGIAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Irwin%20%22sign%20of%20peace%22%20Augustine&amp;f=false Kevin W. Irwin, ''Responses to 101 Questions on the Mass'' (Paulist Press 1999)] {{ISBN|978-0-80913888-3}}, pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Tridentine Mass]] form of the Roman Rite, the sign of peace is given at [[Solemn Mass]]es alone and is exchanged only among the clergy (unless emperors, kings or princes were present, in which case they, too, received the greeting. If several members of a royal family were present, at least the sovereign received the greeting). It is given by extending both arms in a slight embrace with the words "Pax tecum" (Peace be with you), first by the priest celebrant to the [[deacon]], who in turn gives it to the [[subdeacon]], who gives the sign to any other clergy present in [[choir dress]].

In the Roman-Rite revised in 1969, the sign of peace is used at most [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] but is not obligatory. It is exchanged between all present in no prescribed order, except that "the Priest gives the sign of peace to a Deacon or minister".&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; The manner prescribed is as follows: "It is appropriate that each one give the sign of peace only to those who are nearest and in a sober manner. The Priest may give the sign of peace to the ministers but always remains within the sanctuary, so as not to disturb the celebration. He does likewise if for a just reason he wishes to extend the sign of peace to some few of the faithful."&lt;ref name=VD&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html Redemptionis Sacramentum], 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are considered abuses by the [[Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship|Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments]]:&lt;ref name=XD&gt;[https://zenit.org/articles/text-of-vatican-document-on-sign-of-peace-at-mass/ Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments.

*introducing a "song of peace" to accompany the rite;

*the priest leaving the altar to give the sign of peace to some of the faithful;
*expressing other sentiments, e.g. expressing congratulations, best wishes or condolences among those present at a [[wedding]], [[funeral]] or other ceremony.

The gesture by which the sign of peace is exchanged is to be determined by the local [[episcopal conference]]. In some countries, such as the [[United States]], the conference has laid down no rules, and the everyday handshake is generally used, while in other countries, such as [[India]] and [[Thailand]], a bow is prescribed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=S31TA-yPDGwC&amp;pg=PT85&amp;dq=%22sign+of+peace%22+handshake+bow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SWglVKyKDoHN7QbhxoHABA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sign%20of%20peace%22%20handshake%20bow&amp;f=false Peter J. Elliott, ''Liturgical Question Box'' (Ignatius Press 1998)] {{ISBN|978-0-89870677-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 letter of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments recommended that conferences choose gestures more appropriate than "familiar and profane gestures of greeting".&lt;ref name=VD/&gt;

=== Eastern Orthodox Church ===

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]'s Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, the exchange of the peace occurs at the midpoint of the service, when the scripture readings have been completed and the Eucharistic prayers are yet to come. The priest announces, "Let us love one another that with one accord we may confess--" and the people conclude the sentence, "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the Trinity, one in essence and undivided." At that point the Kiss of Peace is exchanged by clergy at the altar, and in some churches among the laity as well (the custom is being reintroduced, but is not universal). Immediately after the peace, the deacon cries "The doors! The doors!"; in ancient times, the catechumens and other non-members of the church would depart at this point, and the doors would be shut behind them. At that, worshippers then recite the Nicene Creed. In the Eastern Orthodox Liturgy, the Kiss of Peace is preparation for the Creed: "Let us love one another that we may confess...the Trinity."

In the early centuries the kiss of peace was exchanged between the clergy: clergy kissing the bishop, lay men kissing laymen, and women kissing the women, according to the Apostolic Constitutions.  Today the kiss of love is exchanged between concelebrating priests.  Such has been the case for centuries. In a few Orthodox dioceses in the world in the last few decades, the kiss of peace between laymen has attempted to be reinstituted, usually as a handshake, hugging or cheek kissing.

Another example of an exchange of the peace is when, during the Divine Liturgy, the Priest declares to the people "Peace be with all", and their reply: "And with your Spirit". More examples of this practice may be found within Eastern Orthodoxy, but these are the most prominent examples.

=== Anglicanism ===
In the Anglican church it is common practice at more formal services for the congregation to be invited to "offer one another a sign of peace". However, this is usually a handshake although married couples may kiss one another instead.

=== Protestantism ===
Different [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] churches have readopted the holy kiss either metaphorically (in that members extend a pure, warm welcome that is referred to as a ''holy kiss'') or literally (in that members kiss one another). This practice is particularly important among many [[Anabaptist]] sects.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

'''Luck egalitarianism''' is a view about [[distributive justice]] espoused by a variety of [[egalitarian]] and other [[political philosopher]]s. According to this view, justice demands that variations in how well off people are should be wholly determined by the responsible choices people make and not to differences in their unchosen circumstances. This expresses the intuition that it is a bad thing for some people to be worse off than others through no fault of their own.

==Theory==
Luck egalitarians therefore distinguish between outcomes that are the result of brute luck (e.g. misfortunes in [[genetics|genetic makeup]], or being struck by a bolt of [[lightning]]) and those that are the consequence of conscious options (such as career choice or fair gambles). Luck egalitarianism is intended as a fundamental normative idea that might guide our thinking about justice rather than as an immediate policy prescription. The idea has its origin in [[John Rawls]]' thought that distributive shares should not be influenced by arbitrary factors. Luck egalitarians disagree among themselves about the proper way to measure how well off people are (for instance, whether we should measure [[material wealth]], psychological [[happiness]] or some other factor) and the related issue of how to assess the value of their resources.

Many philosophers think that the term "luck egalitarianism"&lt;!-- who? --&gt; is a misnomer, because many so-called "luck egalitarians" (of the 'resourcist' strand at least) do not in fact want to equalize luck or eliminate uncertainty, but instead believe that individuals should be equal in the amount of resources they have when facing luck or uncertainty.

==Criticism of theory==

The position is controversial within some currents of egalitarian thought, and the [[philosopher]] [[Elizabeth S. Anderson]] has been a vocal critic of it &amp;mdash; on the ground that, amongst other things, the fact that something is chosen does not necessarily make it acceptable. An example of this would be a robber offering someone the choice "Your [[money]] or your [[life]]," which choice some theorists, including Thomas Hobbes (''Leviathan'' XIV: "Covenants Extorted by Feare are Valide") have regarded as presumptively binding. She also claims that luck egalitarianism expresses a demeaning pity towards the disadvantaged, basing their claims to compensation not on equality but inferiority, and excludes many individuals from the social conditions of their freedom simply on the basis that it is judged to be their fault for losing them. Further, it involves the state making highly moralistic and intrusive judgements about the choices that individuals make, and seems to lead to very counter-intuitive conclusions: those who voluntarily enter jobs with higher-than-average risks, or who 'choose' to live in geographical locations prone to natural disasters may make no claim on others if they suffer as a result of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Elizabeth S.|date=1999-01-01|title=What Is the Point of Equality?|jstor=10.1086/233897|journal=Ethics|volume=109|issue=2|pages=287–337|doi=10.1086/233897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Hurley has argued that any attempt to ground egalitarianism in issues concerning luck and responsibility must fail, because there is no non-circular way of specifying an ''egalitarian'' baseline rather than any other baseline. For instance, a luck inegalitarian could believe that the baseline from which we should correct luck is one where huge inequalities exist. Without merely assuming equality, there seems to be no way of coming to prefer one approach over the other.

==Global luck egalitarianism==

Global luck egalitarianism is a view about distributive justice at the global level associated with cosmopolitan moral theory. It starts from the premise that it is a bad thing for some people to be worse off than others through no fault of their own and applies this intuition across borders. Global luck egalitarians characteristically believe that moral agents may have duties to mitigate the brute luck of distant others. Proponents of this school of thought are amongst others [[Simon Caney]] and arguably [[Charles Beitz]]; opponents, most of whom reject the above premise either in its entirety or with respect to inequalities in which one party's welfare is at least above some minimum level, include [[Robert Nozick]].

==Advocates of theory==
Prominent advocates of luck egalitarianism have included [[Ronald Dworkin]], [[Richard Arneson]], [[Gerald Cohen]], [[John Roemer]], Eric Rakowski, and Kok-Chor Tan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4557">A '''mental state''' is a state of mind that an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] is in. Most simplistically, a mental state is a mental condition. It is a relation that connects the agent with a proposition. Several of these states are a combination of [[mental representation]]s and [[propositional attitude]]s. There are several paradigmatic states of mind that an agent has:  [[love]], [[hate]], [[pleasure]] and [[pain]], and attitudes toward propositions such as: [[belief|believing]] that, [[concept|conceiving]] that, [[hope|hoping]] and [[fear|fearing]] that, etc.

== Mental states and academia ==
Discussions about mental states can be found in many areas of study.

In [[cognitive psychology]] and the [[philosophy of mind]], a mental state is a kind of hypothetical state that corresponds to thinking and feeling, and consists of a conglomeration of [[mental representation]]s and propositional attitudes. Several theories in philosophy and psychology try to determine the relationship between the agent's mental state and a proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Hilary|date=1967|title=The Nature of Mental States|url=|journal=PhilPapers|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piccinini|first=Gualtiero|date=2004|title=Functionalism, Computationalism, &amp; Mental States|url=|journal=Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science|issue=35.4|pages=811–33|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Irwin|date=2000|title=Intersubjective Properties by Which We Specify Pain, Pleasure, and Other Kinds of Mental States.|url=|journal=Philosophy|issue=|pages=89–104|doi=10.1017/s0031819100000073|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weintraub|first=Ruth|date=1987|title=Unconscious Mental States|url=|journal=Philosophical Quarterly|issue=37 (October)|pages=423–32|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of looking into what a mental state is, in itself, [[clinical psychology]] and [[psychiatry]] determine a person's mental health through a [[mental status examination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Stan|date=2015|title=The Feeling of Personal Ownership of One’s Mental States: A Conceptual Argument and Empirical Evidence for an Essential, but Underappreciated, Mechanism of Mind.|url=|journal=Psychology of Consciousness: Research, Practice, and Theory|issue=2|pages=355–76|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epistemology ==
Mental states also include attitudes towards propositions, of which there are at least two—[[Factive verb|factive]], non-factive, both of which entail the mental state of acquaintance. To be acquainted with a proposition is to understand its meaning and be able to entertain it. The proposition can be true or false, and acquaintance requires no specific attitude towards that truth or falsity. Factive attitudes include those mental states that are attached to the truth of the proposition—i.e. the proposition entails truth. Some factive mental states include "perceiving that", "remembering that", "regretting that", and (more controversially) "knowing that".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowledge And Its Limits|last=Williamson|first=Timothy|publisher=Oxford Blackwell Publishing|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-factive attitudes do not entail the truth of the propositions to which they are attached. That is, one can be in one of these mental states and the proposition can be false. An example of a non-factive attitude is believing—you can believe a false proposition and you can believe a true proposition. Since you have the possibility of both, such mental states do not entail truth, and therefore, are not factive. However, belief does entail an attitude of assent toward the presumed truth of the proposition (whether or not it's so), making it and other non-factive attitudes different than mere acquaintance.

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[enumerative combinatorics]], [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] are sometimes established by arguments that rely on singling out one '''"distinguished element"''' of a set.

==Definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be a family of subsets of the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt; be a distinguished element of set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Then suppose there is a predicate &lt;math&gt;P(X,x)&lt;/math&gt; that relates a subset &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Denote &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}(x)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of subsets &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;P(X,x)&lt;/math&gt; is true and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}-x&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of subsets &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;P(X,x)&lt;/math&gt; is false, Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}-x&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint sets, so by the method of summation, the cardinalities are additive&lt;ref name=Petkovsek2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petkovšek|first=Marko|author2=Tomaž Pisanski|title=Combinatorial Interpretation of Unsigned Stirling and Lah Numbers|journal=University of Ljubljana preprint series|date=November 2002|volume=40|issue=837|pages=1-6|url=http://www.imfm.si/preprinti/PDF/00837.pdf|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathcal{A}| = |\mathcal{A}(x)| + |\mathcal{A}-x|&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the distinguished element allows for a decomposition according to a predicate that is a simple form of a [[divide and conquer algorithm]]. In combinatorics, this allows for the construction of [[recurrence relation]]s. Examples are in the next section.

==Examples==
* The [[binomial coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;{n \choose k}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of size-''k'' subsets of a size-''n'' set.  A basic identity—one of whose consequences is that the binomial coefficients are precisely the numbers appearing in [[Pascal's triangle]]—states that:

::&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k-1}+{n \choose k}={n+1 \choose k}.&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Proof:''' In a size-(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) set, choose one distinguished element.  The set of all size-''k'' subsets contains: (1) all size-''k'' subsets that ''do'' contain the distinguished element, and (2) all size-''k'' subsets that ''do not'' contain the distinguished element.  If a size-''k'' subset of a size-(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) set ''does'' contain the distinguished element, then its other ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 elements are chosen from among the other ''n'' elements of our size-(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) set.  The number of ways to choose those is therefore &lt;math&gt;{n \choose k-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  If a size-''k'' subset ''does not'' contain the distinguished element, then all of its ''k'' members are chosen from among the other ''n'' "non-distinguished" elements.  The number of ways to choose those is therefore &lt;math&gt;{n \choose k}&lt;/math&gt;.

*The number of subsets of any size-''n'' set is 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

:'''Proof:'''  We use [[mathematical induction]].  The basis for induction is the truth of this proposition in case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  The [[empty set]] has 0 members and 1 subset, and 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  The induction hypothesis is the proposition in case ''n''; we use it to prove case ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.  In a size-(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) set, choose a distinguished element.  Each subset either contains the distinguished element or does not.  If a subset contains the distinguished element, then its remaining elements are chosen from among the other ''n'' elements.  By the induction hypothesis, the number of ways to do that is 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  If a subset does not contain the distinguished element, then it is a subset of the set of all non-distinguished elements.  By the induction hypothesis, the number of such subsets is 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Finally, the whole list of subsets of our size-(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) set contains 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; elements.

* Let ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be the ''n''th [[Bell number]], i.e., the number of [[partition of a set|partitions of a set]] of ''n'' members.  Let ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be the total number of "parts" (or "blocks", as combinatorialists often call them) among all partitions of that set.  For example, the partitions of the size-3 set {''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c''} may be written thus:

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}abc \\  a/bc \\  b/ac \\  c/ab \\  a/b/c \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:We see 5 partitions, containing 10 blocks, so ''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10.  An identity states:

::&lt;math&gt;B_n+C_n=B_{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Proof:''' In a size-(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) set, choose a distinguished element.  In each partition of our size-(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) set, either the distinguished element is a "singleton", i.e., the set containing ''only'' the distinguished element is one of the blocks, or the distinguished element belongs to a larger block.  If the distinguished element is a singleton, then deletion of the distinguished element leaves a partition of the set containing the ''n'' non-distinguished elements.  There are ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ways to do that.  If the distinguished element belongs to a larger block, then its deletion leaves a block in a partition of the set containing the ''n'' non-distinguished elements.  There are ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; such blocks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3131">'''Model worker''' ({{zh|s=劳动模范|p=láodòng mófàn}}, abbreviated as 劳模 or '''''láomó''''') is a Communist Chinese political term referring to an exemplary worker who exhibits some or all of the traits appropriate to the ideal of the socialist worker. The idea is similar to the Soviet [[Stakhanovite]] icon.  Model workers are selected in China by central and provincial-level departments. Some cities and large companies also have processes for selecting and praising model workers.

The basic criteria for model workers are [[patriotism]], "worship of science," activities in [[environmental protection]], and the pursuit of excellence.

Model workers are often afforded privileges not available to other citizens or [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] members.

[[File:Hao Jianxiu in textile mill.jpg|thumb|[[Hao Jianxiu]], model worker in 1951]]
One of the earliest model workers was the teenage textile worker [[Hao Jianxiu]] (awarded 1951), who invented the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method". She was sent to study at [[East China Textile Engineering Institute]] and was elevated to the upper echelon of Chinese politics, serving as Minister of Textile Industry, secretary of the [[CPC Central Secretariat]], and vice chair of the [[National Development and Reform Commission|State Planning Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Lily Xiao Hong |last2=Stefanowska |first2=A.

Another prominent model worker was [[Ni Zhifu]] (awarded 1959), a [[Fitter (occupation)|fitter]] who invented the "Ni Zhifu drill". He was elevated to leadership positions in the municipal governments of [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Tianjin]], and became a member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China]]. He also served as Chairman of the [[All-China Federation of Trade Unions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politics.people.com.cn/n/2013/0503/c1001-21348753.html |script-title=zh:倪志福同志生平 |trans-title=Biography of Ni Zhifu |work=People's Daily |date=3 May 2013 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mundaneum''' is a non profit organisation based in [[Mons]], [[Belgium]] that runs an exhibition space, website and archive which celebrate the legacy of the original Mundaneum established by [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri La Fontaine]] in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=MES&gt;{{cite web|title=Mundaneum Exhibition Space|url=http://expositions.mundaneum.org/en|website=Mundaneum|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''Mundaneum''' was  created in 1910, following an initiative begun in 1895 by Belgian lawyers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine,&lt;ref name="Google"&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times |date=March 12, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/13/technology/google-to-announce-venture-with-belgian-museum.html?_r=2&amp;ref=global |title=Google to Announce Venture With Belgian Museum |author=Eric Pfanner}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of their work on [[documentation science]]. Otlet first called it the Palais Mondial, meaning "world palace" in English, and it occupied the left wing of the [[Cinquantenaire|Palais du Cinquantenaire]], a government building in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=van den Heuvel|first1=Charles|editor1-last=Rayward|editor1-first=W. Boyd|title=Information Beyond Borders: International Cultural and Intellectual Exchange in the Belle Époque|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317116790|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5C43DAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT315&amp;dq=%22Palais%20Mondial%22%20mundaneum&amp;pg=PT315#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Dynamics of Networks and of Decimal Classification Systems, 1905-1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It aimed to gather together all the world's [[knowledge]] and classify it according to a system they developed called the [[Universal Decimal Classification]]. Otlet and La Fontaine organized an International Conference of International Associations which was the origin of the [[Union of International Associations]] (UIA).

The Mundaneum has been identified as a milestone in the history of data collection and management,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Wolfram | title = Alpha | url = http://www.wolframalpha.com/docs/timeline/computable-knowledge-history-5.html | contribution = Computable knowledge History}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (somewhat more tenuously) as a precursor to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = OUP USA| isbn = 9780199931415| last = Wright| first = Alex| title = Cataloging the World: Paul Otlet and the Birth of the Information Age| location = Oxford ; New York| date = 2014-07-10| pages = 8–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otlet regarded the project as the centrepiece of a new 'world city'—a centrepiece which eventually became an [[archive]] with more than 12 million [[index card]]s and documents. Some consider it a forerunner of the [[Internet]] (or, perhaps more appropriately, of systematic knowledge projects such as [[Wikipedia]] and [[WolframAlpha]]) and Otlet himself had dreams that one day, somehow, all the information he collected could be accessed by people from the comfort of their own homes.

An English pamphlet published in 1914 described it:

{{quote |The International Centre organises collections of world-wide importance. These collections are the International Museum, the International Library, the International Bibliographic Catalogue and the Universal Documentary Archives.  These collections are conceived as parts of one universal body of documentation, as an encyclopedic survey of human knowledge, as an enormous intellectual warehouse of books, documents, catalogues and scientific objects.  Established according to standardised methods, they are formed by assembling cooperative everything that the participating associations may gather or classify. Closely consolidated and coordinated in all of their parts and enriched by duplicates of all private works wherever undertaken, these collections will tend progressively to constitute a permanent and complete representation of the entire world (Union of International Associations, 1914, p. 116).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = W Boyd | last = Rayward | url = http://people.lis.uiuc.edu/~wrayward/otlet/xanadu.htm | contribution = Visions of Xanadu: Paul Otlet (1868–1944) and Hypertext | title = Jasis | volume = 45 | year = 1994 | pages = 235–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Mundaneum was originally housed at the [[Cinquantenaire Museum|Palais du Cinquantenaire]] in [[Brussels]] (Belgium). This was originally renamed Palais Mondial, before the name Mundaneum was adopted. Otlet commissioned architect [[Le Corbusier]] to design a Mundaneum project to be built in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] in 1929.  Although never built, the project triggered the [[Mundaneum Affair]], a theoretical argument between Corbusier and Czech critic and architect [[Karel Teige]].

In 1933, with Otlet's agreement, [[Otto Neurath]] founded the Mundaneum Institute as a branch in [[The Hague]] in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hegselmann|first=Rainer|article=Introduction|title=Unified Science|date=1987|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company|location=Dordrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became central to his activities when he moved to the [[Netherlands]] as a refugee following the defeat of the [[Austrian Social Democratic Party]] in the [[Austrian Civil War]]. In 1936 the Mundaneum Institute launched the [[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neurath|first=Otto|article=An International Encyclopedia of Unified Science (1936)|editor1-last=Cohen|editor1-first=Robert S.|editor2-last=Neurath|editor2-first=Marie|title=Otto Neurath: Philosophical papers 1913-1946|date=1983|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company|location=Dordrecht|page=139|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Belgium in 1940, the Mundaneum was replaced with an exhibit of [[Art of the Third Reich|Third Reich art]], and some material was lost.&lt;ref name="Google"/&gt;

The Mundaneum was reconstituted in a large but decrepit building in [[Leopold Park]].
It remained there until it was forced to move again in 1972.

The Mundaneum has since been relocated to a converted 1930s department store in [[Mons]] ([[Wallonia]]), where the existing museum opened in 1998.&lt;ref name="Google"/&gt;

'''Nominative determinism''' is the [[hypothesis]] that people tend to gravitate towards [[vocation|areas of work]] that fit their names. The term was first used in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' in 1994, after the magazine's humorous Feedback column noted several studies carried out by researchers with remarkably fitting [[surname]]s. These included a book on polar explorations by [[Daniel Snowman]] and an article on urology by researchers named Splatt and Weedon. These and other examples led to light-hearted speculation that some sort of psychological effect was at work. Since the term appeared, nominative determinism has been an irregularly recurring topic in ''New Scientist'', as readers continue to submit examples. Nominative determinism differs from the related concept [[aptronym]], and its synonyms aptonym, namephreak, and Perfect Fit Last Name, in that it focusses on causality. "Aptronym" merely means the name is fitting, without saying anything about why it has come to fit.

The idea that people are drawn to professions that fit their name was suggested by psychologist [[Carl Jung]], citing as an example [[Sigmund Freud]] who studied pleasure and whose surname means "joy". A few recent empirical studies have indicated that certain professions are disproportionately represented by people with appropriate surnames (and sometimes given names), though the methods of these studies have been challenged. One explanation for nominative determinism is ''[[implicit egotism]]'', which states that humans have an unconscious preference for things they associate with themselves. An alternative explanation is [[genetic determinism|genetic]]: a person might be named Smith or Taylor because that was originally their occupation, and they would pass on their genes to their descendants, including an aptitude for activities involving strength in the case of Smith, or dexterity in the case of Taylor.

==Background==
Before people could gravitate towards areas of work that matched their names, many people were given names that matched their area of work.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=2}} The way people are named has changed over time.{{sfn|Fowler|2012| p=11}} In pre-urban times people were only known by a single name &amp;ndash; for example, the Anglo-Saxon name Beornheard.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}}{{efn-ua|Even the Romans, whose [[Roman naming conventions|naming system]] is generally assumed to have used three names, started out with a single name, e.g., Romulus. Over the course of fourteen centuries this then first evolved to two names, to three names (e.g., [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], where Marcus is the [[praenomen]], Tullius the [[nomen gentilicium]], and Cicero the [[cognomen]]), back to two names, and finally one name again.{{sfn|Salway|1994|p=124–126}}}} Single names were chosen for their meaning or given as [[nickname]]s.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}}{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=71}} In England it was only after the [[Norman conquest]] that surnames were added, although there were a few earlier [[Epithet|bynames]] that were not hereditary,{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}}{{sfn|McKinley|1990|pp=25–34}}  such as [[Edmund Ironside]].{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}} Surnames were created to fit the person, mostly from [[patronymic|patronyms]] (e.g., John son of William becomes John Williamson), [[occupational name|occupational descriptions]] (e.g., John Carpenter), character or traits (e.g., John Long), or location (e.g., John from Acton became John Acton).{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=2}} Names were not initially hereditary; only by the mid-14th century did they gradually become so.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=viii}} Surnames relating to trades or craft were the first to become hereditary, as the craft often persisted within the family for generations.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=143}}{{efn-ua|Ancient Roman fathers passed on their cognomen to their children as well.{{sfn|Salway|1994|p=127}} According to Gaius Plinius Secundus, better known as [[Pliny the Elder]], cognomina derived from occupations were initially taken from agriculture &amp;ndash; for example, Cicero means chickpea. Ergo, Marcus Tullius Cicero, the orator, was a descendent of a grower of chickpeas,{{sfn|Wilson|2003|p=10}} although it is also said the cognomen was given for the shape of the nose being similar to that of a chickpea.{{sfn|McKeown|2010|p=22}}}} The appropriateness of occupational names has decreased over time, because tradesmen did not always follow their fathers:{{sfn|Fowler| 2012|p=11}} an early example from the 14th century is "Roger Carpenter the pepperer".{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=143}}

Another aspect of naming was the importance attached to the wider meaning contained in a name. In 17th-century England it was believed that choosing a name for a child should be done carefully. Children should live according to the message contained in, or the meaning of their names.{{sfn|Smith-Bannister|1997|p=11}} In 1652 [[William Jenkyn]], an English clergyman, argued that first names should be "as a thread tyed about the finger to make us mindful of the errand we came into the world to do for our Master".{{sfn|Jenkyn|1652|p=7}} In 1623, at a time when [[Puritans|Puritan]] names such as Faith, Fortitude and Grace were appearing for the first time, English historian [[William Camden]] wrote that names should be chosen with "good and gracious significations", as they might inspire the bearer to good actions.{{sfn|Camden|1984|p=43}}{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=14}} With the rise of the [[British Empire]] the English naming system and English surnames spread across large portions of the globe.{{ sfn|American Council of Learned Societies|1998|p=180}}

By the beginning of the 20th century, Smith and Taylor were two of the three most frequently occurring English surnames; both were occupational, though few smiths and tailors remained.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=43–44}}{{efn-ua|Over time many surnames in patrilineal systems go extinct, sometimes leaving a few to dominate, depending on factors such as number of male children, immigration and merging women's surnames with their spouses upon marriage. A [[Korean surnames|Korean surname]] has a 43% chance of being either Kim, Lee or Park. The [[Galton–Watson process]] models mathematically how much chance a surname has to survive. Under constant assumptions of 1 in 3 chance of 0, 1 or 2 sons, there is a 67% chance that by the fourth generation the surname has died out.{{sfn|Ratzan|2004|p=120–122}}}} When a correspondence between a name and an occupation did occur, it became worthy of note. In an 1888 issue of the ''[[Kentish Note Book]]'' magazine a list appeared with "several carriers by the name of Carter; a hosier named Hosegood; an auctioneer named Sales; and a draper named Cuff".{{sfn|Feedback|2000}}  Since then, a variety of terms for the concept of a close relationship between name and occupation have emerged. The term ''[[aptronym]]'' is thought to have been coined in the early 20th century by the American newspaper columnist [[Franklin Pierce Adams|Franklin P. Adams]].{{sfn|Safire|2004|p=18}} Linguist Frank Nuessel coined ''aptonym'', without an "r", in 1992.{{sfn|Nuessel|1992}} Other synonyms include ''euonym'',{{sfn|Room|1996|p=40}} ''Perfect Fit Last Name'' (PFLN),{{sfn|Levey|1985}} and ''namephreak''.{{sfn|Conrad|1999|p=16}} In [[literary science]] a name that particularly suits a character is called a ''charactonym''.{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|1995|p=229}} Notable authors who frequently used charactonyms as a stylistic technique include [[Charles Dickens]] (e.g., [[Gradgrind|Mr. Gradgrind]], the tyrannical schoolmaster){{sfn|Lederer|2010|p=67}} and [[William Shakespeare]] (e.g., the lost baby [[Perdita (The Winter's Tale)|Perdita]] in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'').{{sfn|Cavill|2016|p=365}} Unlike nominative determinism, the concept of aptronym and its synonyms do not say anything about causality, i.e. why the name has come to fit.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=16}}

Because of the potentially humorous nature of aptronyms a number of newspapers have collected them. ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' columnist [[Herb Caen]] reported irregularly on reader-submitted gems, including substitute teacher Mr. Fillin, piano teacher Patience Scales, and the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s spokesman on the evils of rock 'n roll, Cardinal Rapsong.{{sfn|Conrad|1999|p=16–17}} Similarly, the journalist Bob Levey on occasion listed examples sent in by readers of his column in ''[[The Washington Post]]'': a food industry consultant named Faith Popcorn, a lieutenant called Sergeant, and a tax accountant called Shelby Goldgrab.{{sfn|Levey|1985}}{{sfn|Levey|2000}} Dutch newspaper ''[[Het Parool]]'' had an irregularly featured column called "Nomen est omen" with Dutch examples.{{sfn|Hoekstra|2011|p=45}} Individual name collectors have also published books of aptronyms.{{sfn|Dickson|1996}}{{sfn|Hoekstra|2001}} [[Onomastics|Onomastic]] scholar R.M. Rennick called for more verification of aptronyms appearing in newspaper columns and books.{{sfn|Rennick|1982|p=193}} Lists of aptronyms in science, medicine, and law are more reliable as they tend to be drawn from easily verifiable sources.{{sfn| Keaney|Groarke|Galvin|McGorrian|2013}}{{sfn|Bennett|1992}}

==Definition==
Nominative determinism, literally "name-driven outcome",{{sfn|Alter|2013|p=7}} is the [[hypothesis]] that people tend to gravitate towards areas of work which reflect their names. The name fits because people, possibly subconsciously, made themselves fit. Nominative determinism differs from the concept of aptronyms in that it focuses on causality.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=16}}

The term has its origin in the "Feedback" column of the British magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' in 1994. A series of events raised the suspicion of its editor, John Hoyland, who wrote in the 5 November issue:

{{quote|We recently came across a new book, ''Pole Positions—The Polar Regions and the Future of the Planet'', by [[Daniel Snowman]].{{sfn|Snowman|1993}} Then, a couple of weeks later, we received a copy of ''London Under London—A Subterranean Guide'', one of the authors of which is Richard Trench.{{sfn|Trench|1993}} So it was interesting to see Jen Hunt of the [[University of Manchester]] stating in the October issue of ''[[The Psychologist (publication)|The Psychologist]]'': "Authors gravitate to the area of research which fits their surname."{{sfn|Hunt|1994|p=480}} Hunt's example is an article on incontinence in the ''[[British Journal of Urology]]'' by A. J. Splatt and D. Weedon.{{sfn|Splatt|Weedon|1977}}

We feel it's time to open up this whole issue to rigorous scrutiny. You are invited to send in examples of the phenomenon in the fields of science and technology (with references that check out, please) together with any hypotheses you may have on how it comes about.{{sfn|Feedback|1994a}}}}

Feedback editors John Hoyland and Mike Holderness subsequently adopted the term ''nominative determinism'' as suggested by reader C. R. Cavonius. The term first appeared in the 17 December issue.{{sfn|Alter|2013|p=230}} Even though the magazine tried to ban the topic numerous times over the decades since,{{sfn|Feedback|2015}} readers kept sending in curious examples. These included the U.S. Navy spokesman put up to answer journalists' questions about the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], one Lieutenant Mike Kafka;{{sfn|Feedback|2004}} authors of the book ''The Imperial Animal'' Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox;{{sfn|Feedback|2005}} and the UK Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on knife crime, Alfred Hitchcock.{{sfn|Feedback|2007}}

As used in ''New Scientist'' the term nominative determinism only applies to work.{{sfn|Feedback|1994a}}{{sfn|Feedback|1994b}}{{sfn|Feedback|2000}}{{sfn|Feedback|2015}} In contributions to other newspapers ''New Scientist'' writers have stuck to this definition, with the exception of editor Roger Highfield in a column in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', in which he included "key attributes of life".{{sfn|Highfield|2011}}{{sfn|Colls|2011}}{{sfn|Telegraph staff|2011}}{{efn-ua|Others have extended the area of influence; for example researchers Keaney ''et al.'' entitled their study into the relationship between people called Brady and those who had pacemakers inserted for [[bradycardia]] "The Brady Bunch? New evidence for nominative determinism in patients' health".{{sfn| Keaney|Groarke|Galvin|McGorrian|2013}}}}

Prior to 1994 other terms for the suspected psychological effect were used sporadically. ''Onomastic determinism'' was used as early as 1970 by [[Roberta Frank]].{{sfn|Frank|1970|p=25}} German psychologist [[Wilhelm Stekel]] spoke of "Die Verpflichtung des Namens" (the obligation of the name) in 1911.{{sfn|Stekel|1911|p=110}} Outside of science, ''cognomen syndrome'' was used by playwright [[Tom Stoppard]] in his 1972 play ''[[Jumpers (play)|Jumpers]]''.{{sfn|Stoppard|1972|p=52}} In [[Ancient Rome]] the predictive power of a person's name was captured by the Latin proverb "nomen est omen", meaning the name is a sign.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=17}} This saying is still in use today in English{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=17}} and other languages such as French,{{sfn|Fibbi|Kaya|Piguet|2003|p=0}} German,{{sfn|Schaffer-Suchomel|2009|p=1}} Italian,{{sfn|Gerber|2006|p=0}} Dutch,{{sfn|Hoekstra|2001|p=1}} and Slovenian.{{sfn|Duša|Kenda|2011|p=0}}

''New Scientist'' coined the term ''nominative contradeterminism'' for people who move away from their name, creating a contradiction between name and occupation. Examples include Andrew Waterhouse, a professor of wine,{{sfn|Feedback|2014b}} would-be doctor Thomas Edward Kill, who subsequently changed his name to Jirgensohn,{{sfn|Slovenko|1983|p=227}} and the Archbishop of Manila, [[Jaime Sin|Cardinal Sin]].{{sfn|Feedback|1996}}{{efn-ua|Over the years ''New Scientist'' has reported on other variations on the theme, including ''onomatopoeic nominative determinism'' (e.g., [[European Space Agency]] chief mission scientist Bernard Foing),{{sfn|Feedback|2006}} ''nominative indeterminism'' (to explain the existence of hundreds of scientific articles whose authors include a Wong and a Wright),{{sfn|Feedback|2014a}} and ''occupational preferentialism'' (the hypothesis that one's work influences one's taste, for example policemen liking [[John Constable|Constable]]'s paintings).{{sfn|Feedback|1999}}}} The synonym ''inaptronym'' is also sometimes used.{{sfn|Nunn|2014}}

==Research==
===Theoretical framework===
The first scientists to discuss the concept that names had a determining effect were early 20th-century German psychologists.{{sfn|Flugel|1930|p=208}} Wilhelm Stekel spoke of the "obligation of the name" in the context of compulsive behaviour and choice of occupation;{{sfn|Stekel|1911|p=110}} [[Karl Abraham]] wrote that the determining power of names might be partially caused by inheriting a trait from an ancestor who was given a fitting name. He made the further inference that families with fitting names might then try to live up to their names in some way.{{sfn|Abraham|1979|p=31}} In 1952 [[Carl Jung]] referred to Stekel's work in his theory of [[synchronicity]] (events without causal relationship that yet seem to be meaningfully related):{{sfn|Jung|1972|p=27}}

{{Quote|We find ourselves in something of a quandary when it comes to making up our minds about the phenomenon which Stekel calls the "compulsion of the name". What he means by this is the sometimes quite gross coincidence between a man's name and his peculiarities or profession. For instance&amp;nbsp;... Herr Feist (Mr Stout) is the food minister, Herr Rosstäuscher (Mr Horsetrader) is a lawyer, Herr Kalberer (Mr Calver) is an obstetrician&amp;nbsp;... Are these the whimsicalities of chance, or the suggestive effects of the name, as Stekel seems to suggest, or are they "meaningful coincidences"?{{sfn|Jung|1972|p=15}}}}

Jung listed striking instances among psychologists—including himself: "Herr [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] (Joy) champions the [[Beyond the Pleasure Principle|pleasure principle]], Herr [[Gerhard Adler|Adler]] (Eagle) the will to power, Herr Jung (Young) the idea of rebirth&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Jung|1972|p=15}}

In 1975 psychologist Lawrence Casler called for empirical research into the relative frequencies of career-appropriate names to establish if there is an effect at work or whether we are being "seduced by [[Fortuna|Lady Luck]]". He proposed three possible explanations for nominative determinism: one's self-image and self-expectation being internally influenced by one's name; the name acting as a social stimulus, creating expectations in others that are then communicated to the individual; and genetics – attributes suited to a particular career being passed down the generations alongside the appropriate occupational surname.{{sfn|Casler|1975|p=472}}

In 2002 the researchers Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing that people have a basic desire to feel good about themselves and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the [[self]]. Given the ''[[endowment effect|mere ownership effect]]'', which states that people like things more if they own them, the researchers theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts that are associated with the self, such as their name.{{efn-ua|Studies have shown that most people like the name given to them.{{sfn|Joubert|1985|p=983}} Extensive research also has found a strong effect called the [[name-letter effect]]: when given the choice between letters, people significantly prefer the ones from their own name.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=353}}}} They called this unconscious power ''[[implicit egotism]]''.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479}} Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011|p=46}} Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of the self, then people with low self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.{{sfn|Smeets|2009|p=11}}

===Empirical evidence===
[[File:Igor Judge 2007 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Portrait of a man|[[Igor Judge, Baron Judge|Igor Judge]], a former judge]]
Those with fitting names give differing accounts of the effect of their name on their career choices. [[Igor Judge]], former [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], said he has no recollection of anyone commenting on his destined profession when he was a child, adding "I'm absolutely convinced in my case it is entirely coincidental and I can't think of any evidence in my life that suggests otherwise." James Counsell on the other hand, having chosen a career in law just like his father, his sibling, and two distant relatives, reported having been spurred on to join the bar from an early age and he cannot remember ever wanting to do anything else.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=18}} Sue Yoo, an American lawyer, said that when she was younger people urged her to become a lawyer because of her name, which she thinks may have helped her decision.{{sfn|Silverman|Light|2011}} Weather reporter Storm Field was not sure about the influence of his name; his father, also a weather reporter, was his driving force.{{sfn|Nelson}} Psychology professor Lewis Lipsitt, a lifelong collector of aptronyms,{{sfn|Cole|2001}} was lecturing about nominative determinism in class when a student pointed out that Lipsitt himself was subject to the effect since he studied babies' sucking behaviour. Lipsitt said "That had never occurred to me."{{sfn|Nevid|Rathus|2009|p=202}} [[Church of England]] vicar Reverend Michael Vickers, who denied being a Vickers had anything to do with him becoming a vicar, suggesting instead that in some cases "perhaps people are actually escaping from their name, rather than moving towards their job".{{sfn|Colls|2011}}

|quote = I remember as a child people saying to me "of course you are going to be a barrister because of your name". How much is down to the subconscious is difficult to say, but the fact that your name is similar may be a reason for showing more interest in a profession than you might otherwise. Any link in adult eyes may seem trivial but to someone in their formative years starting to think about their career it's possible it may have an effect.

While reports by owners of fitting names are of interest, some scientists have questioned their value in deciding whether nominative determinism is a real effect.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=18}}{{sfn|Smeets|2009|p=14}} Instead, they argue that the claim that a name affects life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence.{{sfn|Danesi|2012|p=84}} To select only those cases that seem to give evidence for nominative determinism is to ignore those that do not. Analysis of large numbers of names is therefore needed.{{sfn|Bateson|Martin|2001|p=124}} In 2002 Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones analysed various databases containing first names, surnames, occupations, cities and states. In one study they concluded that people named Dennis gravitate towards dentistry. They did this by retrieving the number of dentists called Dennis (482) from a database of US dentists. They then used the 1990 Census to find out which male first name was the next most popular after Dennis: Walter. The likelihood of a US male being called Dennis was 0.415% and the likelihood of a US male being called Walter was 0.416%. The researchers then retrieved the number of dentists called Walter (257). Comparing the relative frequencies of Dennis and Walter led them to their conclusion that the name Dennis is over-represented in dentistry.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479–480}} However, in 2011, Uri Simonsohn published a paper in which he criticized Pelham ''et al.'' for not considering confounding factors and reported on how the popularity of Dennis and Walter as baby names has varied over the decades. Given Walter was a relatively old-fashioned name it was far more likely for Pelham ''et al.'' to find people named Dennis to have any job, not just that of dentist, and people named Walter to be retired. Simonsohn did indeed find a disproportionally high number of Dennis lawyers compared to Walter lawyers.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011|p=23}}{{efn-ua|Confounding variables have also played a role in research into ''monogrammic determinism'': in 1999 Christenfeld, Phillips, and Glynn concluded that people who have positive monograms (e.g., ACE or VIP) live significantly longer than those with negative initials (e.g., PIG or DIE). This conclusion was based on analysis of thousands of California death certificates between 1969 and 1995.{{sfn|Christenfeld|Phillips|Glynn|1999}} Morrison &amp; Smith subsequently pointed out that this was an artifact of grouping data by age at death. Frequency of initials changing over time could be a confounding variable. Indeed when grouping the same data by birth year, they found no statistically significant relationship between initials and longevity.{{sfn|Morrison|Smith|2005}}}}

Aware of Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Mauricio published a new study in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds.{{efn-ua|Initially Pelham and colleagues defended their methods in a rebuttal Simonsohn assessed as also lacking in diligence.{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2011|p=25}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011b|p=31}}}} In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations whose titles matched their surnames, for example, baker, carpenter, and farmer.{{sfn|Pelham|Mauricio|2015|p=692}}

In 2009 Michalos reported the results of an analysis of the occurrences of people with the surname Counsell registered as independent barristers in England and Wales versus those with the name in England and Wales as whole. Given the low frequency of the name in England and Wales as a whole he expected to find no one registered, but three barristers named Counsell were found.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=17}}

In 2015 researchers Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb published a paper on their study into the effect of surnames on medical specialisation. They looked at 313,445 entries in the medical register from the [[General Medical Council]], and identified surnames that were apt for the speciality, for example, Limb for an [[orthopedic surgery|orthopaedic surgeon]], and Doctor for medicine in general. They found that the frequency of names relevant to medicine and to subspecialties was much greater than expected by chance. Specialties that had the largest proportion of names specifically relevant to that specialty were those for which the English language has provided a wide range of alternative terms for the same anatomical parts (or functions thereof). Specifically, these were [[genitourinary medicine]] (e.g., Hardwick and Woodcock) and [[urology]] (e.g., Burns, Cox, Ball). [[Neurology|Neurologists]] had names relevant to medicine in general, but far fewer had names directly relevant to their specialty (1 in every 302). Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb did not report on looking for any confounding variables.{{sfn|Limb|Limb|Limb|Limb|2015|p=24–26}} In 2010 Abel came to a similar conclusion. In one study he compared doctors and lawyers whose first or last names began with three-letter combinations representative of their professions, for example, "doc", "law", and likewise found a significant relationship between name and profession. Abel also found that the initial letters of physicians' last names were significantly related to their subspecialty. For example, Raymonds were more likely to be [[radiology|radiologists]] than [[dermatology|dermatologists]].{{sfn|Abel|2010|p=65}} Two separate studies by Krajick and Neimi in 2005, both analysing large samples of names of scientists, showed 1.35% of geologists having names referring to their field, and in political science, 1.26%.{{sfn|Krajick|2005|p=15}}{{sfn|Neimi|2005|p=13}}

As for Casler's third possible explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, but it was not statistically significant. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.{{sfn|Voracek|Rieder|Stieger|Swami|2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2681">A '''notion''' in [[philosophy]] is a reflection in the [[mind]] of [[reality|real]] [[object (philosophy)|object]]s and [[phenomena]] in their [[essence|essential]] features and relations.  Notions are usually described in terms of scope and content. This is because notions are often created in response to [[empirical]] [[observations]] (or [[experiment]]s) of covarying trends among variables.

''Notion'' is the common translation for ''Begriff'' as used by [[Hegel]] in his [[Science of Logic#Introduction|Science of Logic]] (1816).

== Primitive notion ==
A [[primitive notion]] is used in [[logic]] or [[mathematics]] as an undefined term or concept at the foundation of an axiomatic system to be constructed. 

However, in philosophy the term "primitive notion" has historical content. For example, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] wrote ''De Alphabeto Cogitationum Humanarum'' ([[English language|English]]: ''An Alphabet for Human Thought''). Jaap Maat (2004) reviewed Leibniz for ''Philosophical Languages of the 17th Century''. According to Leibniz, "The alphabet of human thought is a catalogue of primitive notions, or those we cannot render clearer by any definitions." Maat explains, "a thing which is known without other intermediate notions can be considered to be primitive," and further, "a primitive notion is said to be conceived through itself".

Another example is in the ''Meditations'' of [[René Descartes]]:
:I think that there are certain primitive notions in us which are like originals. There are very few such notions. For apart from the most general notions of being, number, duration, etc which apply to everything that we can conceive, we have only the notion of extension that is specifically for the body, and from that flow the notions of shape and movement; and for the soul on its own we have only the concept of thought, which includes perceptions of the understanding and inclinations of the will. Finally, for the body and soul together, we have only the concept of their union, on which depends the notion of the soul's power to move the body and the body's power to act on the soul by causing its sensations and passions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond M. Clarke]] (2003) ''Descartes's Theory of Mind'', page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

:"[Descartes'] claim that mind-body unity is a primitive notion on a par with the primitive notions of thinking and extended substance..."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garber (1992) ''Descartes' Metaphysical Physics'', page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Organisation of Scenographers, Theatre Architects and Technicians''' ('''OISTAT''') is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) founded in 1968 in [[Prague]], Czech Republic. According to its founding name, the organization is mainly a network for theatre designers, theatre architects and theatre technicians around the world, made up of people associated with creating or studying live performances, including educators, researchers and practitioners. The organization has members from 53 countries,{{cn|date=March 2018}} in the membership categories: Centre Member, Associate Member and Individual Member.

==History==
The predecessor of the organization was the scenography section of the [[International Theatre Institute]] (ITI), founded in 1948. This institute was expected to form an international co-operation of all artistic fields and establish leading publishing and educational direction from the drama sections. The project failed, but interest in the visual elements of theatre grew.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Shortly after, in 1958, the International Association of Theatre Technicians (IATT) was formed in Paris. This association also faltered due to lack of direction, programming, organizational structure, administrative and financial provisions.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The representatives sought ITI to take up the activities again, and the ITI Secretary General [[Jean Darcante]] went to Prague in 1967 to discuss with representatives of the Czechoslovak National ITI Center, the Theatre Institute and the Institute of Scenography, the possibility of establishing an organization with a general secretariat in Prague. Czechoslovak scenographers, including professional workers and theatre specialists from both institutions, prepared a draft program for the activity of the new organization with the Czechoslovak Ministry of Culture. Darcante travelled to Prague again in early 1968 to obtain a binding promise from the Czechoslovak official authorities and agree the final details with the Theatre Institute and the Institute of Scenography. On 7 and 8 June 1968, the foundation committee met to establish the new International Organization of Scenographers and Theatre Technicians ({{lang-fr|Organisation Internationale des Scénographes et technicians de Théatre}}; OISTT). The founding membership consisted of representatives from Czechoslovakia, Canada, Israel, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Organizational structure==
===The World Congress===
OISTAT is composed of members in regions around the world, known as OISTAT Centres, Associate members and Individual members. As defined in the Statutes, "the directing body of OISTAT is the Congress, which is formed when the delegates of the OISTAT Centres, Associate Members and Individual Members are assembled in plenary session". Every four years, the delegates of the World Congress elect the President and the members of Executive Committee. They also decide on changes in the Statutes and other arising issues of the organization.

===Executive Committee and Governing Board ===
OISTAT affairs are coordinated by the Governing Board and its Executive Committee. The Executive Committee consists of eight elected members including the President, elected at the congress. The Governing Board consists of the elected chairs of the six commissions.

===Headquarters===
The Headquarters, known as the Secretariat until 2011, are the only constant office of the organization in charge of daily communications, and serve as the central network for its members and commissions. The Headquarters has moved twice since its foundation; it was in Prague from 1968-1993, in the Netherlands from 1993-2005, and since 2006 it is in Taipei, Taiwan.

===Commissions===
Six commissions lead various projects in their field of studies: 

* '''Architecture''': The Architecture commission was composed mainly of architects, theatre designers and technicians. The commission initiated the quadrennial Theatre Architecture Competition (TAC) in 1978 and the finalist designs are exhibited at the Prague Quadrennial.
* '''Education''': This commission is the main facilitator of OISTAT Scenofest and International Stage Design Students' Works Exchange (ISDSWE) in Beijing, China.
* '''Research''': The Research commission focuses on the theoretical and historical aspects of theatre [[scenography]], architecture, and technologies. The Theatre Timeline Sub-commission is a recent establishment by the commission focusing on archiving theatre technologies, recording and preservation.
* '''Performance design''': Performance Design includes four sub-commissions: Costume Design, Lighting Design, Sound Design and Space Design.
* '''Publication and communication''': This commission's recent projects include Core Strategy, World Scenography, the Digital Theatre Words and the Bibliography of Theatre Arts.
* '''Technology''': OISTAT Technology facilitates exchange of ideas in the field of theatre technology, develops research projects, and examines standards and safety issues. The commission offers technical advice and support for theatre technicians worldwide. The Theatre Invention Prize (TIP) is a competition initiated since 2011 by the commission.

In 2011, the competition theme was to design a theatre for a specific performance. The theatre can be in 'found' spaces which were not previously or presently a performing space or create a temporary installation.

In 2015, the theme was to construct a 'floating theatre' on Spree River in Berlin, Germany. The competition has moved from Prague Quadrennial to Berlin's Stage|Set|Scenery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oistat.org/Item/list.asp?id=1503|title=TAC Info &amp; Schedule|website=Oistat.org|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the theme is 'Theatre as Public Space'. The aim of the competition is to challenge the conventional typology of the theatre and to focus on the design of a temporary theatre (or theatres) in The Public Activity Center, a disused sports stadium in Hsinchu City in Taiwan. The 25 selected entries of TAC 2017 were exhibited and awarded during 2017 World Stage Design on July 1–9, 2017 in Taipei, Taiwan.

===World Stage Design===
World Stage Design is an international exhibition of performance design from theatre, dance, music, and opera, as well as a showcase for cross-disciplinary performances and installations in non-conventional theatre spaces since 2005. It is held every four years on different continents, to purposely show the latest designs in theatre performances. Different from the Prague Quadrennial which presents designs curated by each country, World Stage Design allows every individual designer to submit design works directly to the curatorial panel for the grand exhibition. It has been in these cities:
*2005, Toronto, Canada
*2009, Seoul, South Korea
*2013, Cardiff, UK
*2017, Taipei, Taiwan

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7529">'''Overall labor effectiveness''' ('''OLE''') is a [[key performance indicator]] (KPI) that measures the utilization, performance, and quality of the workforce and its impact on productivity.

Similar to [[overall equipment effectiveness]] (OEE), OLE measures availability, performance, and quality.
* Availability – the percentage of time employees spend making effective contributions
* Performance – the amount of product delivered
* Quality – the percentage of perfect or saleable product produced

OLE allows manufacturers to make operational decisions by giving them the ability to analyze the cumulative effect of these three workforce factors on productive output, while considering the impact of both direct and indirect labor.&lt;br /&gt;
OLE supports Lean and Six Sigma methodologies and applies them to workforce processes, allowing manufacturers to make labor-related activities more efficient, repeatable and impactful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=RP news wires|first=Noria Corporation|title=New KPI measures plants' overall labor effectiveness|url=http://www.reliableplant.com/Read/6388/new-kpi-measures-plants'-overall-labor-effectiveness|accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring availability ==
There are many factors that influence workforce availability and therefore the potential output of equipment and the manufacturing plant. OLE can help manufacturers be sure that they have the person with the right skills available at the right time by enabling manufacturers to locate areas where providing and scheduling the right mix of employees can increase the number of productive hours. OLE also accounts for labor utilization. Understanding where [[downtime]] losses are coming from and the impact they have on production can reveal root causes—which can include machine downtime, material delays, or [[absenteeism]]—that delay a line startup.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Calculation: Availability = Time operators are working productively / Time scheduled&lt;br /&gt;
Example:&lt;br /&gt;
Two employees (workforce) are scheduled to work 8 hour (480 minutes) shifts.&lt;br /&gt;
The normal shift includes a scheduled 30 minute break.&lt;br /&gt;
The employees experience 60 minutes of unscheduled downtime.&lt;br /&gt;
Scheduled Time = 960 min − 60 min break = 900 Min&lt;br /&gt;
Available Time = 900 min Scheduled − 120 min Unscheduled Downtime = 780 Min&lt;br /&gt;
Availability = 780 Avail Min / 900 Scheduled Min = 86.67%

== Measuring performance ==
When employees cannot perform their work within standard times, performance can suffer. Effective training can increase performance by improving the skills that directly impact the quality of output.  A skilled operator knows how to measure work, understands the impacts of variability, and knows to stop production for corrective actions when quality falls below specified limits.  Accurately measuring this metric with OLE can pinpoint performance improvement opportunities down to the individual level.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Calculation: Performance = Actual output of the operators / the expected output (or labor standard)&lt;br /&gt;
Example:&lt;br /&gt;
Two employees (workforce) are scheduled to work an 8-hour (480 minute) shift with a 30-minute scheduled break.&lt;br /&gt;
Available Time = 960 min − 60 min break − 120 min Unscheduled Downtime = 780 Min

The Standard Rate for the part being produced is 60 Units/Hour or 1 Minute/Unit&lt;br /&gt;
The Workforce produces 700 Total Units during the shift.&lt;br /&gt;
Time to Produce Parts = 700 Units * 1 Minutes/Unit = 700 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;
Performance = 700 minutes / 780 minutes = 89.74 %

== Measuring quality ==
A number of drivers contribute to quality, but the effort to improve quality can result in a lowering of labor performance.  When making the correlation between the workforce and quality it is important to consider factors such as the training and skills of employees, whether they have access to the right tools to follow procedures, and their understanding of how their roles drive and impact quality. OLE can help manufacturers analyze shift productivity down to a single-shift level, and determine which individual workers are most productive, and then identify corrective actions to bring operations up to standards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Calculation: Quality = Saleable parts / Total parts produced&lt;br /&gt;
Example:&lt;br /&gt;
Two employees (workforce) produce 670 Good Units during a shift.&lt;br /&gt;
700 Units were started in order to produce the 670 Good Units.&lt;br /&gt;
Quality = 670 Good Units / 700 Units Started = 95.71%

== Calculation ==
Effective use of OLE uncovers the data that fuels root-cause analysis and points to corrective actions.  Likewise, OLE exposes trends that can be used to diagnose more subtle problems.  It also helps managers understand whether corrective actions did, in fact, solve problems and improve overall productivity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Example:&lt;br /&gt;
Calculation: OLE = Availability x Performance x Quality&lt;br /&gt;
Example:&lt;br /&gt;
A workforce experiences...&lt;br /&gt;
Availability of 87%&lt;br /&gt;
The Work Center Performance is 89.74%.&lt;br /&gt;
Work Center Quality is 96%.&lt;br /&gt;
OLE = 86.67% Availability x 89.74% Performance x 95.71% Quality = 74,44%

== Labor information tracked ==
The following table provides examples of the labor information tracked by overall labor effectiveness organized by its major categories. Using this labor information, manufacturers can make operational decisions to improve the cumulative effect of labor availability, performance, and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Gregg|title=Lean Labor Strategies|year=2011|publisher=Kronos Publishing|location=page 68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nguyen|first=Mark|title=How Ceradyne Increased Productivity through Effective Labor Management|url=http://www.industryweek.com/articles/how_ceradyne_increased_productivity_through_effective_labor_management_15996.aspx?ShowAll=1|publisher=IndustryWeek|accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Manuel - Epistola de victoria contra infideles habita, 1507 - 4592250.tif|thumb|''Epistola de victoria contra infideles habita'', 1507]]

On 5 December 1496, [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I of Portugal]] signed the decree of expulsion of Jews and Muslims to take effect by the end of October of the next year.&lt;ref name=Decree&gt;António José Saraiva: The Marrano Factory: The Portuguese Inquisition and Its New Christians 1536-1765, BRILL, 2001, {{ISBN|9789004120808}}, p. 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Until the 15th century, some Jews occupied prominent places in Portuguese political and economic life. For example, [[Isaac Abrabanel]] was  the treasurer of King [[Afonso V of Portugal]]. Many also had an active role in [[Portuguese culture]], and they kept their reputation of diplomats and merchants. By this time, [[Lisbon]] and [[Évora]] were home to important Jewish communities.

== Expulsion of Jews==
[[File:A Expulsão dos Judeus (Roque Gameiro, Quadros da História de Portugal, 1917).png|250px|thumb|Expulsion of the Jews in 1497, in a 1917 watercolour by [[Alfredo Roque Gameiro]]]]
On 5 December 1496, because a clause of the contract of marriage between himself and [[Isabella, Princess of Asturias (1470–1498)|Isabella, Princess of Asturias]] stipulated he do so in order to win her hand, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] decreed that all Jews must convert to [[Catholicism]] or leave the country. One set of laws demonstrated the King's wish to completely and forever eradicate Judaism from Portugal.&lt;ref name=Decree/&gt; The initial edict of expulsion was turned into an edict of forced conversion in 1497: Portuguese Jews were prevented from leaving the country and forcibly converted to Christianity. 
Hard times followed for the Portuguese conversos, with [[Lisbon Massacre|the massacre of 2,000 individuals in Lisbon in 1506]] and the later and even more relevant establishment of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] in 1536.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sao Tome &amp; Principle|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/saotome_principe.html|website=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese inquisition was extinguished in 1821 by the "General Extraordinary and Constituent [[Portuguese Cortes|Courts of the Portuguese Nation]]".

When the King allowed conversos to leave after the Lisbon massacre of 1506, many went to the Ottoman Empire (notably [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Constantinople]] and to [[Wattasid Dynasty|Morocco]]. Smaller numbers went to [[Amsterdam]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Colony of Brazil|Brazil]], [[Curaçao]] and the [[Antilles]]. In some of these places their presence can still be witnessed, like the use of the [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] language by some Jewish communities in [[Turkey]], the [[Papiamento|Portuguese based dialects]] of the Antilles, or the multiple [[synagogue]]s built by those who became known as the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]], such as the [[Amsterdam Esnoga]].

Jews who converted to Christianity were known as [[New Christians]], and were always under the constant surveillance of the Inquisition. Many of those were [[crypto-Jew]]s who continued to secretly practice their religion; they eventually left the country in the centuries to come and again embraced openly their Jewish faith. Such was the case, for example, of the family of Baruch Spinoza.

[[File:Inquis1.jpg|thumb|250px|Burning of Crypto-Jews in Lisbon, Portugal]]
Some of the most famous descendants of Portuguese Jews who lived outside Portugal are the philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] (from Portuguese Bento de Espinosa), and the classical economist [[David Ricardo]].

=== Crypto-Jews ===

Some Jews, very few, like the [[Belmonte Jews]], went for a different and radical solution, practicing their faith in a strict secret isolated community. Known as the [[Marranos]], some have survived until today (basically only the community from Belmonte, plus some more isolated families) by the practice of inmarriage and few cultural contacts with the outside world. Only recently have they re-established contact with the international Jewish community and openly practice their religion in a public synagogue with a formal [[rabbi]].

==Expulsion of Muslims==
According to contemporary historian François Soyer, the expulsion of Muslims from Portugal has been overshadowed by the forced conversion of Jews in the country.{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=241}} While tolerance of Muslim minorities in Portugal was higher than in any other part of Europe,{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=258}} Muslims were still perceived as "alien."{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=254, 259}} Anti-Muslim riots were regular in neighboring [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] during the 1460s; however, no similar acts of violence occurred in Portugal.{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=258}}

In December 1496, Manuel I ordered all Muslim subjects to leave without any apparent provocation.{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=242}} According to 15th-century Portuguese historians [[Damião de Góis]] and [[Jerónimo Osório]], the Portuguese government originally planned to forcibly convert or execute Muslims as they had done to Jews, but fear of retaliation from Muslim kingdoms in North Africa led the king to settle on deportations instead.{{sfn|Soyer|2007|pp=260-261}} Manuel I's motivation behind the order is unclear, but some contemporary historians say it was part of a greater goal of Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] and King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] (known as the "[[Catholic Monarchs]]") to rid the peninsula of Muslims and create "religious uniformity" and "monolithic Catholic Christian unity".{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=269}} Other historians say it was influenced by ambitions of conquering Morocco,{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=280}} or by the suggestion of the Dominican confessor to the king, Friar Jorge Vogado.{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=273}} Some Muslims found refuge in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]],{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=262}} but most fled to North Africa.{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=268}}

== Return of some Jews to Portugal ==

In the 19th century, some affluent families of Sephardi Jewish Portuguese origin such as the Ruah and Bensaude, resettled in Portugal from Morocco. The first synagogue to be built in Portugal since the 15th century was the [[Lisbon Synagogue]], inaugurated in 1904.

In 2014 the Portuguese parliament changed the [[Portuguese nationality law]] in order to grant Portuguese nationality to descendants of [[Sephardi Jews]] expelled from Portugal. The law is a reaction to historical events that led to their expulsion from Portugal, but also due to increased concerns over Jewish communities throughout Europe. In order to obtain Portuguese nationality, the person must have a family surname that attests to being a direct descendant of a Sephardi of Portuguese origin or family connections in a collateral line from a former Portuguese Sephardi community. Use of expressions in Portuguese in Jewish rites or [[Judaeo-Portuguese]] or [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] can also be considered proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publico.pt/politica/noticia/descendentes-de-judeus-sefarditas-ja-vao-poder-pedir-a-nacionalidade-1684394|title=Descendentes de judeus sefarditas já vão poder pedir a nacionalidade|author=Lusa|work=PÚBLICO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2015 several hundred [[Turkish Jews]] who were able to prove descent from [[Portuguese Jews]] expelled in 1497 [[immigration to Portugal|emigrated to Portugal]] and acquired [[Portuguese nationality law#Jewish Law of Return|Portuguese citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/amid-rising-european-anti-semitism-portugal-sees-jewish-renaissance/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/new-citizenship-law-has-jews-flocking-to-tiny-portugal-city/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jta.org/2015/03/03/news-opinion/world/portugal-open-to-citizenship-applications-by-descendants-of-sephardic-jews&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3646">'''PhySH''', an abbreviation for '''Physics Subject Headings''', is a classification scheme developed by the [[American Physical Society]] (APS) as an universal classification scheme covering all branches of physics including astronomy, quantum computation, and physics education.&lt;ref&gt;New Physics Classification Scheme Unveiled, https://physh.aps.org/about&lt;/ref&gt; This scheme has been unveiled in January 2016. It substitutes the previous [[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]] (PACS) of the [[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP)&lt;ref&gt;PACS 2010,https://www.aip.org/publishing/pacs/pacs-2010-regular-edition&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently the working tool for all journals of APS and all scientific Conferences and Meetings called by APS.

== Brief History ==

PACS has been created by AIP in 1970s and AIP maintained and updated it until 2010, when AIP decided to keep PACS 2010 as its final version &lt;ref&gt;APS NEWS, E. Conover, New Physics Classification Scheme Unveiled, https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201602/classification.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; because of the inherent limitations to the PACS system.&lt;ref&gt;AIP Thesaurus Replaces PACS, https://www.aip.org/publishing/pacs&lt;/ref&gt; Under these conditions, and confronted with the necessity to operate an efficient classification system well accommodated to fast developments in various branches of physics, APS developed its own PhySH system. The development of PhySH started in 2012, and it has been unveiled in January 2016. Being word based, i.e., operating with regular English words rather than formal PACS codes, PhySH is much more intuitive than PACS. Also, new concepts originating in the course of the development of science can be organically incorporated into PhySH which creates a basis for its further development. Perpetual development is the idea laid into the basis of PhySH system which is expected to become the internationally recognized standard.

== Basics of PhySH ==

PhySH is based on three principal definitions: Disciplines, Facets, and Concepts. Their meaning can be best understood by browsing the PhySH webpage.&lt;ref&gt;Browse PhySH, https://physh.aps.org/browse?facetIds=all&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 17 disciplines, from Accelerators &amp; Beams, through Biological Physics and Networks, to Statistical Physics. Five facets include Research Areas, Physical Systems, Properties, Techniques, and Professional topics. Clicking on them opens lists of related concepts. Using the Search option for a specific term opens a string, or a set of strings, each of them beginning with the related facet that is followed by a set of concepts, beginning from broader and going to more specific. E.g., searching for Van der Waals results in three strings. One of them reads as:

Physical systems &gt; 3-dimensional systems &gt; Complex materials &gt; Heterostructures &gt; Van der Waals heterostructures

Such architecture of PhySH allows its easy extension, and PhySH is considered as a permanently developing rather than finished project. Authors of papers submitted to American physical journals are encouraged to provide editors with PhySH terms to assist in choosing proper reviewers, and some journals even require providing PhySH terms. PhySH is expected to expand with the grows of physics, and this should happen technically through the input coming from authors, reviewers, editors, and organizers of scientific conferences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4672">In [[numerical analysis]], '''predictor–corrector methods''' belong to a class of [[algorithm]]s designed to integrate ordinary differential equations{{snd}}to find an unknown function that satisfies a given differential equation.  All such algorithms proceed in two steps: 

# The initial, "prediction" step, starts from a function fitted to the function-values and derivative-values at a preceding set of points to extrapolate ("anticipate") this function's value at a subsequent, new point. 
# The next, "corrector" step refines the initial approximation by using the ''predicted'' value of the function and ''another method'' to interpolate that unknown function's value at the '''same''' subsequent point.

== Predictor–corrector methods for solving ODEs ==

When considering the [[numerical methods for ordinary differential equations|numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)]], a predictor–corrector method typically uses an [[explicit and implicit methods|explicit method]] for the predictor step and an implicit method for the corrector step.

=== Example: Euler method with the trapezoidal rule ===

A simple predictor–corrector method (known as [[Heun's method]]) can be constructed from the [[Euler method]] (an explicit method) and the [[trapezoidal rule (differential equations)|trapezoidal rule]] (an implicit method).

Consider the differential equation

: &lt;math&gt; y' = f(t,y), \quad y(t_0) = y_0, &lt;/math&gt;

and denote the step size by &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;.

First, the predictor step: starting from the current value &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt;, calculate an initial guess value &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; via the Euler method,

: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}_{i+1} = y_i + h f(t_i,y_i). &lt;/math&gt;

Next, the corrector step: improve the initial guess using trapezoidal rule,

: &lt;math&gt; y_{i+1} = y_i + \tfrac12 h \bigl( f(t_i, y_i) + f(t_{i+1},\tilde{y}_{i+1}) \bigr). &lt;/math&gt;

That value is used as the next step.

=== PEC mode and PECE mode ===

There are different variants of a predictor–corrector method, depending on how often the corrector method is applied. The Predict–Evaluate–Correct–Evaluate (PECE) mode refers to the variant in the above example:

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\tilde{y}_{i+1} &amp;= y_i + h f(t_i,y_i), \\
y_{i+1} &amp;= y_i + \tfrac12 h \bigl( f(t_i, y_i) + f(t_{i+1},\tilde{y}_{i+1}) \bigr). 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

It is also possible to evaluate the function ''f'' only once per step by using the method in Predict–Evaluate–Correct (PEC) mode:

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\tilde{y}_{i+1} &amp;= y_i + h f(t_i,\tilde{y}_i), \\
y_{i+1} &amp;= y_i + \tfrac12 h \bigl( f(t_i, \tilde{y}_i) + f(t_{i+1},\tilde{y}_{i+1}) \bigr). 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, the corrector step can be repeated in the hope that this achieves an even better approximation to the true solution. If the corrector method is run twice, this yields the PECECE mode:

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\tilde{y}_{i+1} &amp;= y_i + h f(t_i,y_i), \\
\hat{y}_{i+1} &amp;= y_i + \tfrac12 h \bigl( f(t_i, y_i) + f(t_{i+1},\tilde{y}_{i+1}) \bigr), \\
y_{i+1} &amp;= y_i + \tfrac12 h \bigl( f(t_i, y_i) + f(t_{i+1},\hat{y}_{i+1}) \bigr). 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The PECEC mode has one fewer function evaluation. More generally, if the corrector is run ''k'' times, the method is in P(EC)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;
or P(EC)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;E mode. If the corrector method is iterated until it converges, this could be called PE(CE)&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Butcher|2003|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VomStein (Gemälde Rincklake).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Freiherr vom und zum Stein]]]]
[[File:Fürst Hardenberg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl August von Hardenberg]].]]

The '''Prussian Reform Movement''' was a series of constitutional, administrative, social and economic reforms early in the nineteenth-century [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. They are sometimes known as the '''Stein-Hardenberg Reforms''', for [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Karl Freiherr vom Stein]] and [[Karl August Fürst von Hardenberg]], their main initiators. Before the Second World War, German historians, such as [[Heinrich von Treitschke]], saw the reforms as the first steps towards the [[unification of Germany]] and the foundation of the [[German Empire]].{{sfn|Dwyer|2014|p=255}}

The reforms were a reaction to the defeat of the Prussians by [[Napoleon I]] at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena-Auerstedt]] in 1806, leading to the [[Treaties of Tilsit|second Treaty of Tilsit]], in which Prussia lost about half its territory and was forced to make massive tribute payments to France. To make those payments, it needed to rationalize its administration. Prussia's defeat and subjection also demonstrated the weaknesses of its [[absolute monarchy]] model of statehood and excluded it from the great powers of Europe.

To become a great power again, it initiated reforms from 1807 onwards, based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas and in line with reforms in other European nations. They led to the reorganization of Prussia's government and administration and changes in its agricultural trade regulations, including the abolition of [[serfdom]] and allowing peasants to become landowners. In industry, the reforms aimed to encourage [[Competition (economics)|competition]] by suppressing the [[monopoly]] of [[guild]]s. The administration was decentralised and the nobility's power reduced. There were also parallel military reforms led by [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]], [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]] and [[Hermann von Boyen]] and educational reforms headed by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Gneisenau made it clear that all these reforms were part of a single programme when he stated that Prussia had to put its foundations in "the three-faced primacy of arms, knowledge and the constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Cited after {{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is harder to ascertain when the reforms ended – in the fields of the constitution and internal politics in particular, the year 1819 marked a turning point, with [[Concert of Europe|Restoration]] tendencies gaining the upper hand over constitutional ones. Though the reforms undoubtedly modernised Prussia, their successes were mixed, with results that were against the reformers' original wishes. The agricultural reforms freed some peasants, but the liberalisation of landholding condemned many of them to poverty. The nobility saw its privileges reduced but its overall position reinforced.

==Reasons, aims and principles==

===Prussia in 1807===

====Prussia's position in Europe====
[[File:Preussen-1806.jpg|thumb|Map showing Prussian territory after Tilsit (in orange)]]
In 1803, [[German Mediatisation]] profoundly changed the political and administrative map of Germany. Favourable to mid-ranking states and to Prussia, the reorganisation reinforced French influence. In 1805, the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] formed in the hope of stopping French domination of Europe from advancing further, but the coalition's armies were defeated at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] in December 1805. Triumphant, [[Napoleon I]] continued working towards dismantling the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. On 12 July 1806, he detached 16 German states from it to form the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] under French influence. On 6 August the same year, [[Francis I of Austria]] was forced to renounce his title of emperor, and the Empire had to be dissolved.

French influence reached as far as the Prussian frontier by the time [[Frederick III of Prussia|Frederick William III of Prussia]] realised the situation. Encouraged by the [[United Kingdom]], Prussia broke off its neutrality (in force since 1795) and repudiated the 1795 [[Peace of Basel]], joined the [[Fourth Coalition]] and entered the war against France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia mobilised its troops on 9 August 1806 but two months later was defeated at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena-Auerstedt]]. Prussia was on the verge of collapse, and three days after the defeat Frederick William III issued posters appealing to the inhabitants of his capital Berlin to remain calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nordbruch|1996|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later, Napoleon entered Berlin.

The war ended on 7 July 1807 with the first Treaty of Tilsit between Napoleon and [[Alexander I of Russia]]. Two days later, Napoleon signed a second Treaty of Tilsit with Prussia, removing half its territory&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Knopper|Mondot|2008|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forcing Prussia's king to recognise [[Jérôme Bonaparte]] as sovereign of the newly created [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], to which Napoleon annexed the Prussian territories west of the [[river Elbe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia had had 9 million inhabitants in 1805,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pölitz|1830|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which it lost 4.55 million in the treaty.&lt;ref name="p501"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=501}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also forced to pay 120 million francs to France in war indemnities&lt;ref name="p501" /&gt; and fund a French occupying force of 150,000 troops.

====Financial situation====
The biting defeat of 1806 was not only the result of poor decisions and Napoleon's military genius, but also a reflection on Prussia's poor internal structures. In the 18th century the Prussian state had been the model of [[enlightened despotism]] for the rest of Germany. To the west and south, there was no single state or alliance that could challenge it. Yet in the era of [[Frederick II of Prussia]] it was a country oriented towards reform, beginning with the abolition of torture in 1740.

[[File:Der König überall2.JPG|thumb|[[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] inspecting his lands and talking to potato growers.]]
The economic reforms of the second half of the 18th century were based on a [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] logic. They had to allow Prussia a certain degree of [[self-sufficiency]] and give it sufficient surpluses for export. Joseph Rovan emphasises that {{cquote|the state's interest required that its subjects were kept in good health, well nourished, and that agriculture and manufacture made the country independent of foreign countries, all the while allowing it to raise money by exporting surpluses&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Economic development also had to fund and support the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Reihlen|1988|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia's infrastructure was developed in the form of canals, roads and factories. Roads connected its outlying regions to its centre, the [[Oder]], [[Warta]] and [[Noteć]] marshes were reclaimed and farmed&lt;ref name="p411"&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; and apple-growing was developed.

However, industry remained very limited, with heavy state-control. Trades were organised into monopolistic guilds and fiscal and customs laws were complex and inefficient. After the defeat of 1806, funding the occupation force and the war indemnities put Prussia's economy under pressure. As in the 18th century, the early 19th century reforms aimed to create budgetary margins, notably in their efforts towards economic development.

====Administrative and legal situation====
Frederick II of Prussia favoured both economic and political reform. His government worked on the first codification of Prussia's laws – the 19,000 paragraph ''Allgemeines Landrecht für die preußischen Staaten'' (literally the ''General legal code for the Prussia states''). Article 22 indicated that all his subjects were equal before the law: {{Cquote|The state's laws unite all its members, without difference of status, rank or sex}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frederick died in 1786 leaving the code incomplete and was succeeded by [[Frederick William II of Prussia]], who extended the same administrative structure and the same civil servants.

The absolutist system started to re-solidify under the obscurantist influence of [[Johann Christoph von Wöllner]], financial privy councillor to Frederick William II. The reforms stalled, especially in the field of modernising society. The editing of the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' was completed in 1792, but the [[French Revolution]] led to opposition to it, especially from the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then withdrawn from circulation for revision and did not come back into force until 1794. Its aims included linking the state and middle class society to the law and to civil rights, but at the same time it retained and confirmed the whole structure of the [[Ancien Régime]].&lt;ref name="p411" /&gt; [[Serfdom]], for example, was abolished in Prussia's royal domains but not in the estates of the great landowners east of the [[river Elbe]].&lt;ref name="Nipperdey_33"&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nobility also held onto its position in the army and administration.

In 1797 Frederick William III succeeded his father Frederick William II, but at the time of his accession he found society dominated by the old guard, apart from the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' promulgated in 1794. His own idea of the state was absolutist and he considered that the state had to be in the hands of the sovereign.&lt;ref name="harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14"&gt;{{harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1806, several observers and high-level civil servants such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein]] and [[Karl August von Hardenberg]] underlined the fact that the Prussia state needed restructuring. As Minister of Finances and the Economy, Stein put some reforms in place, such as standardising the price of salt (then a state monopoly) and partially abolishing the export-import taxes between the kingdom's territories. In April 1806, he published ''Darstellung der fehlerhaften Organisation des Kabinetts und der Notwendigkeit der Bildung einer Ministerialkonferenz'' (literally ''Exposé on the imperfect organisation of the cabinet and on the necessity of forming a ministerial conference''). In it, he wrote: {{Cquote|There should be a new and improved organisation of state affairs, to the measure of the state's needs born of circumstances. The main aim is to gain more strength and unity across the administration}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Türk|Lemke|Bruch|2006|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Start of the reforms===

====Trigger – the defeat of 1806====
[[File:Grassi, Josef Mathias - Luise von Mecklenburg-Strelitz.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Queen Louise of Prussia]]]]
Prussia's war against Napoleon revealed the gaps in its state organisation. Pro-war and a strong critic of his sovereign's policies, Stein was dismissed in January 1807 after the defeat by France. However, Frederick William III saw that the Prussian state and Prussian society could only survive if they began to reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|p=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the treaty of Tislsit, he recalled Stein as a minister on 10 July 1807 with the backing of Hardenberg and Napoleon, the latter of whom saw in Stein a supporter of France.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Pertz, pp. 449–450.{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] also supported Stein's re-appointment&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=451}}&lt;/ref&gt; – indeed, she was more in favour of reform than her husband and was its main initiator. Aided by Stein, Hardenberg and others, she had convinced her husband to mobilise in 1806 and in 1807 she had even met with Napoleon to demand that he review the hard conditions imposed in the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Förster|2004|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg wrote the same year: {{cquote|I believe that queen Louise could tell the king what the queen of Navarre, [[Catherine de Foix]], said to her husband [[Jean d'Albret]] – "If we were born, your dear Catherine and my dear Jean, we would not have lost our kingdom"; for she would have listened to men of energy and asked advice, she would have taken them on and acted decisively. What [the king] lacks in personal strength is replaced in this way. An enterprising courage would have replaced a tolerant courage.&lt;ref name="harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14"&gt;{{harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stein set certain conditions for his taking the job, among which was that the cabinets system should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Pertz, pp. 115–116.{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place, ministers had to win their right to power by speaking to the king directly. After this condition had been satisfied, Stein took up his role and was thus directly responsible for the civil administration as well as exercising a controlling role over the other areas. Frederick William III still showed little inclination to engage in reforms and hesitated for a long while.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Förster|2004|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reformers thus had to expend much effort convincing the king. In this situation, it was within the bureaucracy and the army that the reformers had to fight the hardest against the nobility and the conservative and restorationist forces. The idealist philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] thus had a great influence on the reformers – Stein and Hardenberg each produced a treatise describing their ideas in 1807.

====''Nassauer Denkschrift''====
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln - Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Heinrich vom Stein]], instigator of the early reforms]]
After his recall, Stein retired to his lands in [[Nassau, Germany|Nassau]]. In 1807, he published the ''Nassauer Denkschrift'', whose main argument was the reform of the administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the reforms in the states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], Stein's approach was traditionalist and above all anti-Enlightenment, focussing instead on critiquing absolutism. Stein followed English models such as the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and was sceptical of a centralised and militarised bureaucracy, favouring a decentralised and collegiate administration. With his collaborators, he followed (in his own words) a "policy of defensive modernisation, not with Napoleon but against him".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stein, the administration should be split up by field and no longer by geographical area.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the administration had to be divided into two branches – the public revenue branch and the top-level state-policy branch (''oberste Staatsbehörde''). One of the main aims of this concept was to rationalise the state financial system to raise the money to meet its war indemnities under the treaty of Tilsit. Rationalising the state finances would allow the state to raise revenue but limit losses due to poor administrative organisation.

Stein was an anti-absolutist and an anti-statist, suspicious of bureaucracy and central government. For him, civil servants were only men paid to carry out their task with "indifference" and "fear of innovation".&lt;ref name="p141"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, he set out to decentralise and form a collegiate state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein thus gave more autonomy to the provinces, [[Districts of Germany|Kreise]] and towns. Thanks to the different posts he had previously held, Stein, realised that he had to harmonise the government of the provinces.&lt;ref name="p141" /&gt; He had recourse to the old corporative constitution, as he had experienced in [[Westphalia]]. The landowner, according to Stein, was the keystone to local self-government – "If the landowner is excluded from all participation in the provincial administration, then the link which links him to the fatherland remains unused".&lt;ref name="p141"/&gt;

However, it was not only functional considerations which played a role for Stein. He felt he first had to educate the people in politics and provincial self-government was one of the most useful things in this area. On landowners' participation in the provincial administration, he wrote&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|the economy as regards administrative costs is however the least important advantage gained by the landowners' participation in the provincial administration. What is much more important is to stimulate the spirit of the community and of the civic sense, the use of sleeping and poorly led forces and spreading knowledge, the harmony between the spirit of the nation, its views and its needs and those of the national administrations, the re-awakening of the feelings for the fatherland, independence and national honour.}} In his reform projects, Stein tried to reform a political system without losing sight of the Prussian unity shaken by the defeat of 1806.

====''Rigaer Denkschrift''====
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln - Barthold Georg Niebuhr.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebuhr]] on the Cologne monument (1878)]]
Stein and Hardenberg not only made a mark on later policy but also represented two different approaches to politics, with Hardenberg more steeped in Enlightenment ideas. He took the principles of the French Revolution and the suggestions created by Napoleon's practical policy on board more deeply than Stein.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg was a [[statism|statist]] who aspired to reinforce the state through a dense and centralised administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kitchen|2006|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, these differences only represented a certain change of tendency among the reformers. The initiatives put in place were very much things of their own time, despite the latter umbrella concept of the 'Stein-Hardenberg reforms'.

The ''Rigaer Denkschrift'' was published the same year as Stein's work and presented on 12 September 1807. It bore the title 'On the reorganisation of the Prussian state'. Previously living in [[Riga]], Hardenberg had been summoned in July by the king of Prussia under pressure from Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg developed ideas on the overall organisation of the Prussian state that were different from those of his fellow reformers. The main editors of the ''Rigaer Denkschrift'' were [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], an expert financier, [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], a future minister of Finances&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walther|1993|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]]. These three men concluded that the Revolution had given France a new impetus: "All the sleeping forces were re-awakened, the misery and weakness, the old prejudices and the shortcomings were destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;''Rigaer Denkschrift'' in {{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in their view, Prussia had to follow France's example: {{Cquote|The folly of thinking that one can access the revolution in the safest way, remaining attached to the [[ancien regime]] and strictly following the principles for which it argues has only stimulated the revolution and made it continually grow larger. These principles' power is so great – they are so generally recognised and accepted, that the state that does not accept them must expect to be ruined or to be forced to accept them ; even the rapacity of Napoleon and his most-favoured aides are submitted to this power, and will remain so against their will. One cannot deny that, despite the iron despotism with which he governs, he nevertheless follows these principles widely in their essential features ; at least he is forced to make a show of obeying them.&lt;ref name="Rigaer_88"&gt;''Rigaer Denkschrift'' in {{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The authors thus favoured a revolution "im guten Sinn" or "in the right sense",&lt;ref name="Rigaer_88"/&gt; which historians later described as "revolution from above". Sovereigns and their ministers thus put in place reforms to gain all the advantages of a revolution without any of the disadvantages, such as losing their power or suffering from setbacks or outbreaks of violence.

As in Stein's Denkschrift, the ''Rigaer Denkschrift'' favours reviving national spirit to work with the nation and the administration. Hardenberg also sought to define society's three classes – the nobility, the middle class and the peasants. For him, the peasants took part in "the most numerous and most important but nevertheless the most neglected and belittled class in the state" and added that "the peasant class has to become the main object of our attention".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg also sought to underline the principal of merit which he felt had to rule in society, by affirming "no task in the state, without exception, is for this or that class but is open to merit and to skill and to the ability of all classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview of the reforms===
Within fourteen months of his appointment, Stein put in place or prepared the most important reforms. The major financial crisis caused by the requirements of Tilsit forced Stein into a radical austerity policy, harnessing the state's machinery to raise the required indemnities. The success of the reforms begun by Stein was the result of a discussion already going on within the upper bureaucracy and Stein's role in putting them in place was variable – he was almost never, for example, involved in questions of detail. Many of the reforms were drafted by others among his collaborators, such as [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]] in the case of the October decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Klein|1965|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stein was responsible for presenting the reforms to the king and to other forces opposed to them, such as the nobility.

[[File:2006-08-07 Rathaus Schoeneberg Gedenkrelief vom Stein.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque celebrating Stein and the ''Städteordnung'' in Berlin (1913)]]
During Stein's short period of office, decisive laws were promulgated, even if the organizational law on state administration was not published until 1808 (i.e. after Stein's fall). It was during Stein's time in office that the edict of October 1807 and the cities' organizational reforms (''Städteordnung'') of 1808 were put into effect. After a short term of office by [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], Hardenberg regained control of policy. From 1810, he bore the title of ''[[Staatskanzler]]'',&lt;ref name="harvp|Büsch|1992|p=287"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; retaining it until 1822. Thanks to him, land reform was completed via the Edicts of Regulation (''Regulierungsedikten'') of 1811 and 1816 as well as the ''Ablöseordnung'' (literally the ''redemption decree'') of 1821. He also pushed through the reforms of trades such as the edict on professional tax of 2 November 1810 and the law on policing trades (''Gewerbepolizeigesetz'') of 1811. In 1818 he reformed the customs laws, abolishing internal taxes. As for social reform, the edict of emancipation was promulgated in 1812 for Jewish citizens. Despite the different initial situations and aims pursued, similar reforms were carried out in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine, except for the military and educational reforms. The Restoration tendencies put a stop to the reformist policy in Prussia around 1819 or 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main reform fields===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|In the field of political economy, the reformers were strongly influenced by [[Adam Smith]].]]
The reforms which were to be put in place were essentially a synthesis between historic and progressive concepts. Their aim was to replace the absolutist state structures which had become outdated. The state would have to offer its citizens the possibility of becoming involved in public affairs on the basis of personal freedom and equality before the law. The government's main policy aim was to make it possible to liberate Prussian territory from French occupation and return the kingdom to great-power status through modernising domestic policy.&lt;ref name="p453"&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prussian subject had to become an active citizen of the state thanks to the introduction of self-government to the provinces, districts (''kreise'') and towns. National sentiment had to be awakened as Stein foresaw in his Nassau work,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; but a citizen's duties were in some ways more important than his or her rights. Moreover, Stein's concept of self-government rested on a class-based society. A compromise between corporative aspects and a modern representative system was put in place. The old divisions into the [[three estates]] of nobility, clergy and [[bourgeoisie]] were replaced by divisions into nobility, bourgeoisie and peasants. The right to vote also had to be expanded, particularly to free peasants, which would be one of the bases for the freeing of the peasants in 1807.

The new organisation of power in the countryside and reform of industry were factors in the liberalisation of the Prussian economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, the Prussian reforms went much further than those in the states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] and were much more successful. The 1806 financial crisis, intensified by the indemnities, the occupation costs and other war costs, gave the necessary impetus for these changes – in all, Prussia had to pay France 120 million francs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leo|1845|p=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freeing of the peasants, the industrial reforms and the other measures removed economic barriers and imposed free competition. The Prussian reforms relied on the economic liberalism of [[Adam Smith]] (as propounded by [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]] and [[Christian Jakob Kraus]]) more heavily than the south German reformers. The Prussian reformers did not actively seek to encourage Prussian industry, which was then under-developed, but to remedy the crisis in the agricultural economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=109–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State and administration==
The reformers' top priority was to reorganise the administration and the state. Before 1806, there was not really a single Prussian state, but a multiplicity of states and provinces, mostly only held together by the single person of the king himself. There was no unified administration – instead there were the two parallel structures of decentralised administrations (each responsible for all portfolios within a single given territory) and a centralised administration (responsible for a single portfolio across the whole of Prussia). This double structure made any coordinated action difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also had no overview of Prussia's economic situation and its government ministers had little clout faced with the king's cabinet, where they had less power than the king's private political councillors.

===Bureaucracy and leadership===
The start of the Stein era saw the unification of the Prussian state, with the old system of cabinets being abolished. A ministry of state (''Staatsministerium'') was introduced on 16 December 1808 in place of a top-level administration poorly defined as the ''Generaldirektorium''. This reform was completed in 1810. Now the administration was ruled according to the principle of portfolios. The ''Staatsministerium'' included five major ministries – minister of the interior, minister for foreign affairs, minister for finances, minister for justice and minister of war, all responsible to the king alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; These modifications could not take full effect, however, until a more effective statist model of leadership was created. This was done by replacing Prussian absolutism with a double domination of king and bureaucracy, in which the ministers had an important role, reducing the king's influence and meaning he could now only reign through his ministers' actions. In Stein's era, the ''Staatsministerium'' was organised in a collegiate way without a prime minister – that post was set up under Hardenberg, who received the title of ''Staatskanzler'' or State Chancellor in June 1810&lt;ref name="harvp|Büsch|1992|p=287"/&gt; along with control over the ministers' relations with the king.

The role of the head of state was also considerably modified. From 1808, Prussia was divided into districts. The different governments of these districts were set up according to the principle of portfolios, as with the national ministers of state. Each region was given an ''[[Oberpräsident]]'' for the first time, directly subordinate to the national ministers and with the role of stimulating public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their rôle, which even went as far as putting up sanitary cordons in the event of an epidemic, was similar to that of French [[prefect (France)|prefect]]s – that is, to represent regional interests to the central government. The post was abolished in 1810 but revived in 1815 to play an important part in political life. It was in this context that justice and administration were separated once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Botzenhart|1985|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the establishment of administrative acts, the people concerned thus had a right of appeal. Nevertheless, there was no judicial control on the administration. Aiming to reduce any influence on the administration, this was reinforced by different administrative acts. The organisation that the reformers put in place served as a model for other German states and to major businesses.

===National representation===
[[File:Friedrich-August-Ludwig-von-der-Marwitz-1777-1837.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich August von der Marwitz]] was one of the representatives of the aristocratic opposition.]]
In parallel to the ''Staatsministerium'', Stein planned the creation of a ''Staatsrat'' or [[Privy Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he had had no opportunity to set up a correctly functioning one by 1808 and it was Hardenberg who set it up in 1810. The text of the relevant law stated: {{Cquote|We ordain a Council of State and by edict give our orders and our decisions on one side in this upper chamber and on the other side in our cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The members of the Council of State had to be current ministers or former ministers, high-level civil servants, princes of the royal house or figures nominated by the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commission was also formed to function as a kind of parliament, with major legislative rights. As a bastion of the bureaucracy, the Council of State had to prevent any return to absolutism or any moves to reinforce the interests of the [[Ancien Régime]]. The Council of State also had to [[subrogation|subroge]] all laws and administrative and constitutional procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way as the towns' self-government, Hardenberg foresaw the establishment of a national representative body made up of [[Imperial State|corporative]] and representative elements. The first assembly of notable figures was held in 1811 and the second in 1812. These were made up of a corporative base of 18 aristocratic landowners, 12 urban property owners and nine representatives from among the peasants. This corporative composition was based partly on the traditional conception of society and partly on practical and fiscal considerations&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=461}}&lt;/ref&gt; – in order to be able to pay its war indemnities to France, the Prussian state had to have massive recourse to credit contracts issued by the aristocrats and to gain credit in foreign countries the different states had to offer themselves as guarantors.

After the summoning of the provisional assemblies, it quickly became clear that their deputies' first priority was not the state's interests but more defending their own classes' interests. The nobility saw the reforms as trying to reduce their privileges and so blocked them in the assemblies, led by figures such as [[Friedrich August von der Marwitz]] and Friedrich Ludwig Karl Fink von Finkenstein. Their resistance went so far that the cabinet even resorted to imprisoning them at [[Spandau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bussiek|2002|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Reinhart Koselleck]] has argued that the establishment of a corporative national representative body prevented all later reforms. At the end of the reforming period, the districts and the provincial representative bodies (such as the ''Provinziallandtage'') remained based on corporative principles. Prussia was prevented from forming a true representative national body, with considerable consequences on the internal development of Prussia and the [[German Confederation]]. Thus, while the states of the Confederation of the Rhine located in southern Germany became constitutional states, Prussia remained without a parliament until 1848.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=113"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform of the towns===
[[File:Stadtverordnete1808.jpg|thumb|upright|Religious service for the first Prussian municipal councillors in 1808 in Berlin]]
Prior to the reforms the Prussian towns east of the [[river Elbe]] were under the state's direct control, with any surviving instances of self-government retaining their names and forms but none of their power. Stein's reform of the towns used this former tradition of self-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; All rights specific to a certain city were abolished and all the cities put under the same structures and rule – this even came to be the case for their courts and police. Self-government was at the centre of the town reforms of 1808, with the towns now no longer subject to the state and their citizens given a duty to participate in the towns' political life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the strongest indication of Stein's rejection of a centralised bureaucracy – self-government had to awaken its citizens' interest in public affairs in order to benefit the whole Prussian state.

The ''Städteordnung'' (Municipal Ordinance) of 1808 defined a citizen (or at least a citizen in the sense of the inhabitant of a town or city) as "a citizen or member of an urban community which possesses the right of citizenship in a town".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipal councillors were representatives of the town and not of an order or [[Three Estates|estate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; These councillors could be elected by all landowning citizens with a taxable revenue of at least 15 [[Thaler|taler]]. A councillor's main task was to participate in the election of a municipal council or ''Magistrat'', headed by a mayor. The election of the mayor and the members of the council had to be ratified by the central government. Different officials were put in place to carry out administrative portfolios. The council managed the municipal budget and the town also managed its own police.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some democratic elements, the town administrations retained large corporative elements – the groups were differentiated according to their estates and only citizens had full rights. Only landowners and industrial property-owners had a right to citizenship, though it was in principle also open to other people, such as ''Eximierten'' (bourgeois people, mostly those in state service) or ''Schutzverwandten'' (members of the lower classes without full citizenship rights). The costs linked to a citizen's [[octroi]] dissuaded many people. It was only the new reform of 1831 which replaced the 1808 assemblies of ''Bürger'' (citizens) with assemblies of inhabitants. Until the [[Vormärz]], self-government in the towns was in the hands of artisans and established businessmen. In the cities and large towns, the citizens with full rights and their families represented around a third of the total population. Resistance by the nobility prevented these reforms from also being set up in the countryside.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=113"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|pp=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reforms were a step towards modern civic self-government.

===Customs and tax reforms===
Tax reform was a central problem for the reformers, notably due to the war indemnities imposed by Napoleon, and these difficulties marked Hardenberg's early reforms. He managed to avoid state bankruptcy&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Müller-Osten|2007|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inflation by increasing taxes or selling off lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; These severe financial problems led to a wholesale fiscal reform. Taxes were standardised right across Prussia, principally by replacing the wide variety of minor taxes with main taxes. The reformers also tried to introduce equal taxation for all citizens, thus bringing them into conflict with aristocratic privileges. On 27 October 1810, the king proclaimed in his ''Finanzedikt'':{{cquote|We find we need to ask all our faithful subjects to pay increased taxes, mainly in the taxes on consumer goods and deluxe objects, though these will be simplified and charged on fewer articles, associated with the raising of complementary taxes and [[excise]]s all as heavier taxes. These taxes will be borne in a proportional manner by all the classes of the nation and will be reduced as soon as the unfortunate need disappears.{{#tag:ref|"Wir sehen Uns genöthigt, von Unsern getreuen Unterthanen die Entrichtung erhöhter Abgaben, hauptsächlich von der Konsumtion und von Gegenständen des Luxus zu fordern, die aber vereinfacht, auf weniger Artikel zurückgebracht, mit Abstellung der Nachschüsse und der Thoraccisen, so wie mehrerer einzelner lästigen Abgaben, verknüpft und von allen Klassen der Nation verhältnißmäßig gleich getragen, und gemindert werden sollen, sobald das damit zu bestreitende Bedürfniß aufhören wird."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}}
Excises were raised the following year on appeals.&lt;ref name="p118"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1819, excise (originally only raised by the towns) was suppressed and replaced with a tax on the consumption of beer, wine, gin and tobacco.&lt;ref name="p28"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the industrial sphere, several taxes were replaced with a progressively spread-out professional tax. Other innovations were an income tax and a tax on wealth based on a tax evaluation carried out by the taxpayer. 1820 saw protests against a tax on classes, the tax being defined by the taxpayer's position in society.&lt;ref name="p28" /&gt; This tax on classes was an intermediate form between [[Tax per head|poll tax]] and income tax. The towns had the possibility of retaining the tax on cattle and cereal crops. The results for fiscal policy remain controversial. The nobility was not affected by the taxes as the reformers had originally planned, so much so that they did not managed to put in place a 'foncier' tax also including the nobility. The poorest suffered most as a result of these measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zollvereinpreussen.jpeg|thumb|One of the forerunners of the ''Zollverein'' was [[Wilhelm Anton von Klewitz]], Prussian Minister of Finances.]]
It was only after the end of the Napoleonic Wars and after the territorial reorganisation of Europe at the [[Congress of Vienna]] that Prussia's customs duties were reformed. At the Congress Prussia regained its western territories, leading to economic competition between the industrialised part of these territories such as the [[Rhine Province]], the [[Province of Westphalia]] and the territories in Saxony on the one hand and the essentially agricultural territories to the east of the Elbe on the other. Customs policy was also very disparate.&lt;ref name="p118" /&gt; Thus, in 1817, there were 57 customs tariffs on 3,000 goods passing from the historic western territories to the Prussian heartland, with the taxes in the heartland not yet having spread to the formerly French-dominated western provinces.

This was one of the factors that made customs reform vital. That reform occurred on 26 May 1818, with the establishment of a compromise between the interest of the major landowners practicing free-exchange and those of the still-weak industrial economy asking for [[protectionism|protectionist]] custom duties. They therefore only took on what would now be called a tax for protecting internal markets from foreign competition and customs duties for haulage were lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mercantile policy instituted by Frederick II thus came to an end. Export bans were lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Reihlen|1988|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The customs laws and duties put in place by the reformers proved so simple and effective over time that they served as a model for taxation in other German states for around fifty years and that their basic principles remained in place under the [[German Empire]]. The Prussian customs policy was one of the important factors in the creation of the [[Zollverein|Deutscher Zollverein]] in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fischer|1972|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|pp=442–445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and politics==

===Agricultural reforms===
Agriculture was reformed across Europe at this time, though in different ways and in different phases. The usefulness of existing agricultural methods came into doubt and so the [[Ancien Régime]]'s and [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s agricultural structures were abolished. Peasants were freed and became landowners; and services and [[corvée]]s were abolished. Private landownership also led to the breakdown of [[common land]]s – that is, to the usage of woods and meadows 'in common'. These communal lands were mostly given to lords in return for lands acquired by the peasants. Some meadow{{what|date=May 2018}} reforms had already taken place in some parts of Prussia before 1806, such as the freeing of the peasants on royal lands in the 18th century, though this freeing only fully came into force in 1807.

The landowning nobility successfully managed to oppose similar changes. The government had to confront aristocratic resistance even to the pre-1806 reforms, which became considerable. The ''Gesindeordnung'' of 1810 was certainly notable progress for servants compared to that proposed in the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'', but still remained conservative and favourable to the nobility. The nobility's opposition to this also led to several privileges being saved from abolition. The rights of the police and the courts were controlled more strongly by the state, but not totally abolished like religious and scholarly patrongage, hunting rights and fiscal privileges. Unlike the reforms in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], the nobles were not asked to justify their rank. The reformers made compromises, but the nobility were unable to block the major changes brought by the reforms' central points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|pp=40–43, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edict of October 1807====
[[File:Oktoberedikt.jpg|thumb|upright|Frontispiece of the October 1807 edict.]]
The freeing of the peasants marked the start of the Prussian reforms. The kingdom's modernisation began by modernising its base, that is, its peasants and its agriculture. At the start of the 19th century, 80% of the German population lived in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Botzenhart|1985|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edict of 9 October 1807, one of the central reforms, liberated the peasants and was signed only five days after Stein's appointment on von Schön's suggestion. The October edict began the process of abolishing [[serfdom]] and its hereditary character. The first peasants to be freed were those working on the domains in the ''Reichsritter'' and on 11 November 1810 at the latest, all the Prussian serfs were declared free:&lt;ref name="p51"&gt;{{harvp|Botzenhart|1985|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Cquote|On [[St Martin's Day]] 1810 all servitude ended throughout our states. After St Martin's Day 1810, there would be nothing but free people as was already the case over our domains in our provinces[...].{{#tag:ref|"Mit dem Martini-Tage Eintausend Achthundert und Zehn (1810.) hört alle Guts-Unterthänigkeit in Unsern sämmtlichen Staaten auf. Nach dem Martini-Tage 1810. giebt es nur freie Leute, so wie solches auf den Domainen in allen Unsern Provinzen schon der Fall ist [...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}} However, though serfdom was abolished, [[corvée]]s were not – the October edict said nothing on the latter subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The October edict authorised all Prussian citizens to acquire property and choose their profession, including the nobles, who until then could not take on jobs reserved for the bourgeoisie: {{Cquote|Any nobleman is authorised, without prejudice to its estate, to take up a bourgeois job ; and any bourgeois or peasant is authorised to join the bourgeoisie in the case of the peasant or the peasantry in the case of the bourgeois.{{#tag:ref|"Jeder Edelmann ist, ohne allen Nachtheil seines Standes, befugt, bürgerliche Gewerbe zu treiben; und jeder Bürger oder Bauer ist berechtigt, aus dem Bauer- in den Bürger und aus dem Bürger- in den Bauerstand zu treten"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}} The principle of "[[dérogeance]]" disappeared.

The peasants were allowed to travel freely and set up home in the towns and no longer had to buy their freedom or pay for its with domestic service. The peasants no longer had to ask their lord's permission to marry – this freedom in marriage led to a rising birth rate and population in the countryside. The freeing of the peasants, however, was also to their disadvantage – lordly domains were liberalised and major landowners were allowed to buy peasants' farms (the latter practice having been illegal previously). The lords no longer had an obligation to provide housing for any of their former serfs who became invalids or too old to work. This all led to the formation of an economic class made up of bourgeois and noble entrepreneurs who opposed the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edict of regulation (1811)====
After the reformers freed the peasants, they were faced with other problems, such as the abolition of corvées and the establishment of properties. According to the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'', these problems could only be solved by compensating the financiers. The need to legally put in place a "revolution from above" slowed down the reforms.

The edict of regulation of 1811 solved the problem by making all peasants the owners of the farms they farmed. In place of buying back these lands (which was financially impossible), the peasants were obliged to compensate their former lords by handing over between a third and a half of the farmed lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid splitting up the lands and leaving areas that were too small to viably farm, in 1816 the buy-back of these lands was limited to major landowners. The smaller ones remained excluded from [[allodial title]].&lt;ref name="p117f"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other duties linked to serfdom, such as that to provide domestic service and the payment of authorisation taxes on getting married, were abolished without compensation. As for corvées and services in kind, the peasants had to buy back from their lords for 25% of their value.

[[File:Baranowen-1850.jpg|thumb|Estate of Baranowen]]
The practical compensations in Prussia were without doubt{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} advantageous compared to the reforms put in place in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine. In effect, they allowed the process of reform to be accelerated. Nevertheless, the 12,000 lordly estates in Prussia saw their area increase to reach around 1.5 million Morgen&lt;ref name="p118f"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; (around 38,000 hectares), mostly made up of common lands, of which only 14% returned to the peasants, with the rest going to the lords. Many of the minor peasants thus lost their means of subsistence and most could only sell their indebted lands to their lords and become agricultural workers.&lt;ref name="p94"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[set-aside|jachère]] lands were made farmable, but their cultivation remained questionable due to their poor soil quality. The measures put in place by the reformers did have some financial success, however, with Prussia's cultivated land rising from 7.3 to 12.46 million hectares in 1848&lt;ref name="p94" /&gt; and production raised by 40%.&lt;ref name="p117f" /&gt;

In the territories east of the Elbe, the agricultural reforms had major social consequences. Due to the growth of lordly estates,&lt;ref name="p118f" /&gt; the number of lordly families rose greatly, right up until the second half of the 19th century. The number of exploited lands remained the same. A very important lower social class was also created. According to region and the rights in force, the number of agricultural day workers and servants rose 2.5 times. The number of minor landowners, known as ''Kätner'' after their homes (known as ''Kotten''), tripled or even quadrupled. Many of them were dependent on another job. Ernst Rudolf Huber, professor of public law, judged that the agricultural reforms were {{Cquote|one of the tragic ironies of German constitutional history. Through it was shown the internal contradiction of the bourgeois liberalism which created the liberty of the individual and his property and at the same time – due to its own law of the liberty of property – unleashed the accumulation of power in the hands of some people.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reform of industry and its results===
[[File:Schneider wappen.jpg|thumb|upright|Arms of the tailors' guild – like the other guilds, it lost its influence due to the ''Gewerbefreiheit''.]]
The reformers aspired to free individual forces in the industrial sphere just as in the agricultural one, in their devotion to the theories of Adam Smith. To free these forces, they had to get rid of guilds and an economic policy based on mercantilism. To encourage free competition also meant the suppression of all limitations on competition.

It was in this context that the freedom of industry (''Gewerbefreiheit'') was introduced in 1810–1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; To set up an industry, one had to acquire a licence, but even so there were exceptions, such as doctors, pharmacists and hotelliers. The guilds lost their monopoly role and their economic privileges. They were not abolished, but membership of them was now voluntary, not compulsory as it had been in the past. State control over the economy also disappeared, to give way to a free choice of profession and free competition. The reform of industry unlocked the economy and gave it a new impetus. There was no longer any legal difference in the industrial sphere between the town and the countryside. Only mining remained as an exception until the 1860s.

Originally planned to encourage rural industry, the freedom of industry became the central condition for Prussian economic renewal on an industrial base. As had happened with the nobility, the citizens of the towns arose unsuccessfully opposed the reforms. Their immediate results were contradictory—early on, non-guild competition was weak, but after a period of adaptation the number of non-guild artisans rose significantly. However, in the countryside, the burdens of the artisans and other industries rose considerably. This rise in the number of artisans was not accompanied by a similar growth in the rest of the population.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of master-craftsmen rose too, but master-craftsmen remained poor due to the strong competition. During the [[Vormärz]], tailors, cobblers, carpenters and weavers were the main over-subscribed trades. The rise in the lower classes in the countryside accentuated the 'social question and would be one of the causes of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 Revolution]].&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|pp=429–432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish emancipation===
{{further|Jewish emancipation|Disabilities (Jewish)}}
By the Edict of Emancipation of 11 March 1812, Jews [[Jewish emancipation|gained the same rights and duties]] as other citizens:
{{Cquote|We, Frederick William, King of Prussia by the Grace of God, etc. etc., having decided to establish a new constitution conforming to the public good of Jewish believers living in [[Royal we|our]] Kingdom, proclaim all the former laws and prescriptions not confirmed in this present Edict to be abrogated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} To gain civil rights, all Jews had to declare themselves to the police within six months of the promulgation of the edict and choose a definitive name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Edict was the result of a long reflection since 1781, begun by [[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm]], pursued by [[David Friedländer]] in a thesis to Frederick William II in 1787 (Friedländer approved the Edict of 1812&lt;ref&gt;Jean Mondot, "L'émancipation des Juifs en Allemagne entre 1789 et 1815", in {{harvp|Knopper|Mondot|2008|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Humboldt's influence allowed for the so-called "[[Jewish question]]" to be re-examined.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Mondot, "L'émancipation des Juifs en Allemagne entre 1789 et 1815", in {{harvp|Knopper|Mondot|2008|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 8 of the Edict allowed Jews to own land and take up municipal and university posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews were free to practise their religion and their traditions were protected. Nevertheless, unlike the reforms in the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], the Edict of Emancipation in Prussia [[Disabilities (Jewish)|did have some limitations]] – Jews could not become army officers or have any government or legal role, but were still required to do military service.

Even if some traditionalists opposed the Edict of Emancipation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=460}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it proved a major step towards Jewish emancipation in the [[German states]] during the 19th century. The judicial situation in Prussia was significantly better than that in most of southern and eastern Germany, making it an attractive destination for Jewish immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|p=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other areas==

===Education===

====New organisation====
[[File:Reiterstandbild Wilhelm III Sockelfig Koeln2007 Humboldt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] wished to reform Prussia's school and university system.]]
For the reformers, the reform of the [[Prussian education system]] (''Bildung'') was a key reform. All the other reforms relied on creating a new type of citizen who had to be capable of proving themselves responsible and the reformers were convinced that the nation had to be educated and made to grow up. Unlike the state reforms, which still contained corporative elements, the ''Bildungsreform'' was conceived outside all class structures. [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] was the main figure behind the educational reform. From 1808, he was in charge of the department of religion and education within the ministry of the interior. Like Stein, Humboldt was only in his post for a short time, but was able to put in place the main elements of his reforms.

Humboldt developed his ideas in July 1809 in his treatise ''Über die mit dem Königsberger Schulwesen vorzunehmende Reformen'' (''On reforms to execute with the teaching in Königsberg''). In place of a wide variety of religious, private, municipal and corporative educational institutions, he suggested setting up a school system divided into ''Volksschule'' (people's schools), ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]s'' and universities. Humboldt defined the characteristics of each stage in education. Elementary teaching "truly only need be occupied with language, numbers and measures, and remain linked to the mother tongue being given that nature is indifferent in its design".{{#tag:ref|"Er hat es also eigentlich nur mit Sprach-, Zahl- und Mass-Verhältnissen zu thun, und bleibt, da ihm die Art des Bezeichneten gleichgültig ist, bei der Muttersprache stehen."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} For the second stage, that of being taught in school, Humboldt wrote "The aim of being taught in school is to exercise [a pupil's] ability and to acquire knowledge without which scientific understanding and ability are impossible.{{#tag:ref|"Der Zweck des Schulunterrichts ist die Uebung der Fähigkeit, und die Erwerbung der Kenntnisse, ohne welche wissenschaftliche Einsicht und Kunstfertigkeit unmöglich ist."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Finally, he stated that university had to train a student in research and allow him to understanding "the unity of science".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1812, a university entry had to obtain the ''[[Abitur]]''. The state controlled all the schools, but even so it strictly imposed compulsory education and controlled exams. To enter the civil service, performance criteria were set up. Education and performance replaced social origin.

====New humanism====
[[File:Wilhelm von Humboldt Denkmal - Humboldt Universität zu Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Humboldt in front of the [[Humboldt University]] in Berlin (1882)]]
Wilhelm von Humboldt backed a new [[humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the utilitarian teaching of the Enlightenment, which wished to transmit useful knowledge for practical life, Humboldt desired a general formation of man. From then students had to study antiquity and ancient languages to develop themselves intellectually.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only would they acquire this humanistic knowledge, they would also acquire other knowledge necessary for other jobs. The state would not seek to form citizens at all costs to serve it, but it did not entirely let go of that aim:
{{Cquote|Each [student] who does not give evidence of becoming a good artisan, businessman, soldier, politician is still a man and a good citizen, honest, clear according to his rank without taking account of his own job. Give him the necessary training and he will acquire the particular capacity for his job very easily and always hold onto liberty, as is the case so often in life, going from one to the other.{{#tag:ref|"Jeder ist offenbar nur dann ein guter Handwerker, Kaufmann, Soldat und Geschäftsmann, wenn er an sich und ohne Hinsicht auf seinen besonderen Beruf ein guter, anständiger, seinem Stande nach aufgeklärter Mensch und Bürger ist. Gibt ihm der Schulunterricht, was hierzu erforderlich ist, so erwirbt er die besondere Fähigkeit seines Berufs nachher sehr leicht und behält immer die Freiheit, wie im Leben so oft geschieht, von einem zum anderen überzugehen"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Giesecke|1991|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}} Unlike Humboldt, for whom the individual was at the centre of the educational process, the republican [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] rather leaned towards national education to educate the whole people and thus to affirm the nation in the face of Napoleonic domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In paying professors better and improving their training, the quality of teaching in the ''Volksschule''s was improved. The newly founded ''gymnasia'' offered a humanist education to ready pupils for university studies. In parallel ''Realschule''s were set up&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=661}}&lt;/ref&gt; to train men in manual trades. Some schools for officer cadets were allowed to remain. Despite stricter state influence and control, the religious authorities retained their role in inspecting schools.

====Universities====
[[File:Berlin Universitaet um 1850.jpg|thumb|Berlin University around 1850.]]
In Humboldt's thinking, university represented the crowning glory of intellectual education and the expression of the ideal of freedom between teaching and research held an important place in it. German universities of the time were mostly mediocre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Humboldt, "the state must treat its universities neither as gymnasia nor as specialist schools and must not serve its Academy as a technical or scientific deputation. Together, they must [...] demand nothing of them which does not give it profit immediately and simply".{{#tag:ref|"Der Staat muss seine Universittendäten weder als Gymnasien noch als Specialschulen behandeln, und sich seiner Akademie nicht als technischen oder wissenschaftlichen Deputation bedienen. Er muss im Ganzen [...] von ihnen nichts fordern, was sich unmittelbar und geradezu auf ihn bezieht."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

Students, in his view, had to learn to think autonomously and work in a scientific way by taking part in research. The foundation of [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]] served as a model. It was opened in 1810 and the great men of the era taught there – [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], the physician [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]], the historian [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] and the jurist [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the educational reforms' results were different from what Humboldt had expected. Putting in place his ideal of [[philology|philological]] education excluded the lower classes of society and allied the educational system to the restorationist tendencies. The major cost of education rendered the reforms in this area ineffective. The reformers had hoped that people would rise through the social scale thanks to education, but this did not happen so well as they had hoped.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
[[File:Berlin Scharnhorst memorial.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] in Berlin (1822)]]
[[File:Reorganisation.jpg|thumb|Commission for military reorganisation at [[Königsberg]] in 1807. The two men in the foreground are [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau|Gneisenau]] and [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]], with the seated person in civilian dress is [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein|Stein]].]]
Unlike the reforms in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine, the Prussian policy was aimed against French supremacy right from the start. Also, the Prussian military reforms were much more profound than those in the south German states. They were instigated by a group of officers which had formed after the defeats of 1806 and notably included [[Gerhard Johann David von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]], [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau|Gneisenau]], [[Hermann von Boyen|Boyen]], [[Karl von Grolman|Grolman]] and [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]].&lt;ref name="p28"/&gt;

Chief of staff since 1806, Scharnhorst became head of the military reorganisation commission set up by Frederick William III in July 1807. For him, every citizen was a born defender of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Abenheim|1987|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main aim was to drive out the French occupiers. In close contact with Stein, Scharnhorst managed to convince the king that the military needed reform. Like the civil administration, the military organisation was simplified, via the creation of a Prussian ministry of war and of an army staff on 25 December 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Millotat|2000|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scharnhorst was at the head of the new ministry and he aimed his reforms at removing the obstacles between army and society and at making the army ground itself in the citizens' patriotism.

====Military service====
[[File:Sommerschenburg Gneisenau.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial to Gneisenau in Sommersdorf-Sommerschenburg (1835)]]
The experiences of 1806 showed that the old organisation of the Prussian army was no longer a match for the might of the French army. Compared to the French defensive tactics, Prussian tactics were too immobile. Its officers treated their soldiers as objects and punished them severely&lt;ref name="p453" /&gt; – one of the most severe punishments, the ''Spießrutenlaufen'', consisted of making a soldier pass between two ranks of men and be beaten by them. The French instead had compulsory military service and the Prussian army's adoption of it was the centre of Prussia's military reforms.

[[File:Gneisenaustatue.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Statue of Gneisenau in Berlin (1855)]]
Frederick William III hesitated about the military reforms, the officer corps and nobility resisted them and even the bourgeoisie remained sceptical. The start of the [[German campaign of 1813]] was the key factor. On 9 February 1813 a decree replaced the previous conscription system with an obligation to serve by canton ''Kantonpflichtigkeit''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this new system had to last for the whole war. Thus it looked to restore the pride and position of the common soldier in adapting army discipline to civil law. The punishments and in particular the 'schlague' (consisting of a soldier being beaten) were abolished. The social differences had to disappear. The Treaty of Tilsit had reduced the Prussian army to 42,000 men, but Scharnhorst put in place the "Krümper system",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lange|1857|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted of training a number of soldiers by making them turn without ever exceeding the numbers authorised by the Treaty. Between 30,000 and 150,000 supplementary men were also trained – the training system changed several times and so it is difficult to work out precise numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Neugebauer|Busch|2006|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory military service was ordered by Frederick William III on 27 May 1814 then fixed by a military law on 3 September the same year:{{Cquote|Every man of 20 years is obliged to defend the fatherland. To execute this general obligation, particularly in time of peace, in such manner that the progress of science and industry will not be disturbed, the following exclusion must be applied in taking into account the terms of service and the duration of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Other====
The officer corps was also reformed and several officers dismissed.&lt;ref name="rovan459"&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nobility's privilege was abolished and a career as an officer was opened up to the bourgeois. The aristocrats disliked this and protested, as with [[Hans David Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg]]. In practice a system of co-opting of officers was put in place which gave generally favoured nobles, even if there remained some (albeit minor) bourgeois influence. Starting with the regiment of chasseurs on campaign, chasseur and protection units were set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gumtau|1837|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Hans David Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck von Wartenburg]] who from June 1808 occupied on their training.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Neugebauer|Busch|2006|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the officer corps, it was now the terms of service not the number of years served which determined promotion. The Prussian Academy of War also provided better officer training than before – dissolved after the defeat at Jena, it had been refounded in 1810 by Scharnhorst.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Millotat|2000|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1813–1814&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Braeuner|1863|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the line infantry troops, we also see the [[Landwehr]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; which served as reserve troops to defend Prussia itself. It was independent in organisation and had its own units and its own officers. In the ''Kreise'' (districts), commissions organised troops in which the bourgeois could become officers. The reformers' idea of unifying the people and the army seems to have succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|pp=50–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteer chasseur detachments (''freiwillige Jägerdetachements'') were also formed as reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Neugebauer|Busch|2006|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main leaders==
[[File:Reiterstandbild Wilhelm III Sockelfig Koeln2007vonSchon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Theodor von Schön]]]]
The reforms are sometimes named after their leaders Stein and Hardenberg, but they were also the fruit of a collaboration between experts, each with his own speciality. One of these experts was [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]] – born in 1773, he had studied law at Königsberg university to follow a career in political sciences. In 1793 he entered Prussian service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roloff|1997|p=787}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years later, he became financial councillor to the ''Generaldirektorium''. When the Prussian government fled to [[Königsberg]] after its defeat at Jena, he followed Stein there. It was there that he brought to bear his expertise on [[serfdom]] and it was his treatise that would help Stein write the October edict. Unlike Stein, Schön backed a greater liberalisation of landowning – for him, economic profitability had to take first priority, even if this was to the peasants' disadvantage.&lt;ref name="klein"&gt;{{harvp|Klein|1965|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1816, Schön became ''Oberpräsident'', a post he held for around 40 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; and devoted himself to the economic and social life of the provinces which he governed.&lt;ref name="klein" /&gt;

[[File:Berlin-tiergarten beuth-humboldt 20050406 p1020313.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statues of [[Christian Peter Wilhelm Beuth|Beuth]] and Humboldt on Burggrafenstraße in [[Tiergarten (park)|Tiergarten]], Berlin (1878)]]
Schön also took part in editing the ''Rigaer Denkschrift''. In 1806 he travelled with a group of civil servants that had gathered around the just-dismissed Hardenberg – the group also included [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], [[Friedrich August von Stägemann]] and [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hensler|Twesten|1838|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr had studied law, philosophy and history at the university of Kiel between 1794 and 1796. In 1804 he was made head of the Danish national bank. His reputation as a financial expert quickly spread to Prussia. On 19 June 1806, Niebuhr and his family left for Riga with other civil servants to work with Hardenberg when he was dismissed. On 11 December 1809, he was made financial councillor and section chief for state debt. In 1810, he edited a note to the king in which he expressed strong doubts on whether a financial plan put in place by Hardenberg could be realised. Its tone he employed was so strong that the king disavowed him&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hensler|Twesten|1838|p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so Niebuhr retired from politics.

The three other civil servants present at Riga – [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], [[Wilhelm Anton von Klewitz]] and [[Friedrich August von Stägemann]] – also played important rôles in the reforms. Altenstein became high financial councillor in the ''Generaldirektorium''. When Stein was dismissed in 1807, Altenstein and the minister of finances [[Friedrich Ferdinand Alexander zu Dohna-Schlobitten]] put in place the state reform conceived by Stein.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810, Klewitz and Theodor von Schön edited the ''Verordnung über die veränderte Staatsverfassung aller obersten Staatsbehörden'' (''Decree on the new constitution of all the high portfolios of state''). Other collaborators took part in the reforms, such as Johann Gottfried Frey (chief of police in [[Königsberg]] and the real author of the ''Städteordnung''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schüler-Springorum|1996|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Friedrich Leopold Reichsfreiherr von Schrötter (who collaborated with Stein on the ''Städteordnung''), [[Christian Peter Wilhelm Beuth]] (in Prussian service since 1801, who had collaborated with Hardenberg on the fiscal and industrial laws) and Christian Friedrich Scharnweber (who had some influence on Hardenberg&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vogel|1980|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Resurgence of Prussia==
[[File:An Mein Volk.jpg|thumb|upright|[[An Mein Volk]] – the Prussian king's appeal to his people on 17 March 1813]]
{{See also|German campaign (Napoleonic Wars)}}
From 1806 onwards isolated uprisings occurred in Germany and the German-speaking countries. On 26 August 1806 the bookseller [[Johann Philipp Palm]] was shot for publishing an anti-Napoleon pamphlet,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Radrizzani|2002|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a strong public outcry. In 1809, [[Andreas Hofer]] launched an insurrection in the Tyrol, but met the same fate as Palm. Anti-Napoleonic feeling developed little by little, with Germans feeling their spirits weighed down by the French occupation and Prussia still paying huge indemnities to the French. When Napoleon's 1812 [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] met with disaster, it lit a glimmer of hope in Germany and above all in Prussia. On 30 December 1812, [[Hans David Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck von Wartenburg]] signed the [[convention of Tauroggen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which Prussia in effect turned against Napoleon and repudiated the Treaty of Tilsit.

On 13 March 1813 Frederick William III made his '[[An Mein Volk]]' speech, making an appeal:
{{Cquote|To my people! ... Brandenburgers, Prussians, Silesians, Pomeranians, Lithuanians! You know what you have endured for nearly seven years, you know what will be your sad fate if we do not end with honour the fight we have begun. Remember past times, the Great Elector, the great Frederick [II]. Keep in your minds the good things our ancestors won under his command: freedom of conscience, honour, independence, trade, industry and science. Keep in your minds the great example of our powerful Russian allies, keep in your mind the Spanish, the Portuguese, even the lesser people who have declared war on powerful enemies to win the same good things and have gained victory [...] Great sacrifices are demanded of all classes, for our beginning is great and the numbers and resources of our enemies are great [...] But whatever the sacrifices demanded of the individual, they pale beside the holy goods for which we make them, for the things for which we fight and must win if we do not wish to stop being Prussians and Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following 27 March Prussia declared war on France and the following 16–19 October saw the beginning of the end for Napoleonic power with the [[battle of Leipzig]]. On 1 October 1815 the Congress of Vienna opened and at it Harbenberg represented the victorious Kingdom of Prussia.

==Historiography==

===Early analyses===
[[File:Heinrich von Treitschke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heinrich von Treitschke]] long influenced the positive perception of the Prussian reforms from the 19th to the 20th century.]]
In late 19th century historiography, the Prussian reforms and the "revolution from above" were considered by [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] and others to be the first step in the foundation of the German Empire on the basis of a 'small-Germany' solution. For [[Friedrich Meinecke]], the reforms put in place the conditions necessary for the future evolution of Prussia and Germany. For a long time, under the influence of [[Leopold von Ranke]], the era of reforms was presented first and foremost as a story of the deeds and destinies of "great men", as shown by the large number of biographies written about the reformers – [[Hans Delbrück]] wrote about Gneisenau and Meinecke about Boyen, for example.

Indeed, it was the military reforms which first gained the researchers' interest. It was only with the biography of [[Max Lehmann]] that Stein's life and actions were analysed. Unlike Stein, the biographers paid little attention to Hardenberg. Despite the significant differences between Stein and Hardenberg, historiography saw a fundamental continuity between their approaches that made them one single unified policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=235–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors, such as [[Otto Hintze]], underlined the role of reform programmes such as the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' of 1794. One such continuity confirmed the theory that the reformers were already a distinct group before the reforms occurred. [[Thomas Nipperdey]] resumed the debate by writing that there had been reform plans before the disaster of 1806, but that those behind them had lacked the energy to put them into force and also lacked internal cohesion.&lt;ref name="Nipperdey_33"/&gt; As for the agricultural reforms, the works of Georg Friedrich Knapp aroused a controversy at the end of the 19th century – he criticised the reform policy, stating that it favoured the aristocrats' interests and not the peasants' interests. He held Adam Smith's liberal interest responsible for the evolution of certain problems. Research later led to a global critique which could not be maintained. After all, the peasants' properties were developed, even if the lands they gained were most often revealed to be poor soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=239–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuances in criticism===
[[File:Gaertner2.jpg|thumb|upright|It was only in 1848 that a plan for a constitution was discussed in the Sing-Akademie.]]
Today, the industrial reforms' success is also critiqued in a more nuanced way. They are considered not to have been the immediate reason for the artisans' misery, instead taken as the reduced influence of the legislation on their development. The historian Barbara Vogel tried to address an overall concept of agricultural and industrial approaches and to describe them as a "bureaucratic strategy of modernisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vogel|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; When industrial development was taken into account, the policy of reforms is seen to certainly be centred on the encouragement of rural industry in the historic Prussian territories, thus allowing the onset of Prussia's [[industrial revolution]].

[[Reinhart Koselleck]] tried to give a general interpretation of the reform policy in view of the 1848 revolution, in his work ''Preußen zwischen Reform und Revolution'' (''Prussia between Reform and Revolution''). He distinguished three different processes. The ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' represented – at the time of its publication – a reaction to social problems, but remained attached to corporative elements. Koselleck saw the birth of an administrative state during the reform era and during the reinforcement of the administration between 1815 and 1825 as an anticipation of the later constitution. However, in his view, the following decades saw the political and social movement suppressed by the bureaucracy. After the end of the reform period, Koselleck underlined that there was a rupture in the equilibrium between the high level civil servants and the bourgeois of the 'Bildungsbürgertum' who could not become civil servants. According to him, the bureaucracy represented the general interest against the individual interest and no national representative body was set up for fear of seeing the reforming movement stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Koselleck|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln - Gesamtansicht.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] in the [[Heumarkt]] in [[Cologne]], erected to the glory of Prussia – round its base are statues of the great Prussian reformers such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein|Stein]], [[Karl August von Hardenberg|Hardenberg]], [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön|Schön]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]]]]
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln 1869 W. Gause.jpg|thumb|upright|Cologne monument (1878)]]
The historian Hans Rosenberg and later the representatives of the Bielefeld School supported the theory that the end of the process which would have led to a constitution in Prussia was one of the reasons for the end to its democratisation and for the ''[[Sonderweg]]''. Hans-Jürgen Puhle, professor at Frankfurt University, even held the Prussian regime to be "in the long term programmed for its own destruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Puhle|1980|p=15}}, cited in {{harvp|Langewiesche|1994|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers more orientated towards [[historicism]] such as Thomas Nipperdey underlined the divergence between the reformers' intentions and the unexpected later results of the reforms.

Several decades ago, the Prussian reforms from 1807 to 1819 lost their central position in historical study of 19th-century Germany. One contributing factor to this decline is that the reforms in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine were considered as similar by several historians. Another is that the Prussian regions – dynamic in industry and society – belonged to the French sphere of influence directly or indirectly until the end of the [[First French Empire|Napoleonic era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=241–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials to the reformers==

===Statues===
Several statues of the reformers were set up, especially of Stein. In 1870 a statue of Stein by [[Hermann Schievelbein]] was put up on the [[Dönhoffplatz]] in Berlin. Around its base can be read "To minister Baron vom Stein. The recognition of the fatherland.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stamm-Kuhlmann|2001|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Hardenberg by Martin Götze was also put up beside it in 1907. Stein's statue now stands in front of the [[Landtag of Prussia]] in Berlin.

===Cologne memorial===
One of the most important monuments to the reformers is that in the Heumarkt in [[Cologne]], made up of an equestrian statue of Frederick William III by Gustav Blaeser on a base surrounded by statues of important figures of the era, including several Prussian reformers: Stein, Hardenberg, Gneisenau, Scharnhorst, Humboldt, Schön, Niebuhr and Beuth. The monument's design process had been launched in 1857&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Reihlen|1988|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was inaugurated on 26 September 1878, with a medal marking the occasion bearing [[William I of Germany]] and his wife on the obverse and the monument and the phrase "To king Frederick William III, the Rhine states recognise him" on the reverse. The monument recalled the Berlin [[equestrian statue of Frederick the Great]], designed by [[Christian Daniel Rauch]], master of Blaeser.

===Other===
Stein featured on commemorative stamps in 1957 and 2007 and Humboldt in 1952, whilst several streets are now named after the reformers, especially in Berlin, which has a Humboldtstraße, a Hardenbergstraße, a Freiherr-vom-Stein-Straße, a Niebuhrstraße, a Gneisenaustraße and a Scharnhorststraße.

Most scientists agree that [[religiosity]] is not an independent personality trait, but something that can have the effect of personality traits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual Differences and Personality|last=Ashton|first=Michael C|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|year=2007|isbn=9780123741295|location=Oxford, UK|pages=260–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing religiosity through the lenses of differing personality characteristics provides a relatively empirical way to study a difficult concept. Over time, the act of being religious has been a consistent behavior across almost every culture, and thus provides evidence that our personality can help explain the seeming predisposition of religious people.

With the ability to use modern, empirically tested personality measures, researchers can link results with religiosity. In linking personality measures with religion, it is possible to quantitatively study results, which can provide insight into how and why religion is such an important element of being human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|title=Religion, Personality, and Social Behavior|year=2014|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York|url=http://www.psypress.com/books/details/9781848726659/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more research is needed to definitively say that there is a correlation between certain personality characteristics and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by [[Raymond F. Paloutzian]], Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality |year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=1-57230-922-9|pages=253-2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five-factor model of personality==
The [[five-factor model]] of personality is currently accepted as a comprehensive model of personality.&lt;ref name=Digman&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Digman | first1 = J.M. | year = 1990 | title = Personality structure: Emergence of the five-factor model | url = |journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 417–440 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ps.41.020190.002221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The five-factor model (FFM) identifies five broad traits underlying the many narrower traits that can be used to describe personality.  The identified traits are: 1) extraversion, the quantity and intensity of one's interpersonal interactions 2) neuroticism, the tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and hostility 3) conscientiousness, the persistence, organization, and motivation exhibited in goal-directed behaviors 4) agreeableness, the quality of one's interpersonal interactions along a continuum from compassion to antagonism 5) openness, the proactive seeking and appreciation of new experiences. The idea behind the big five personality characteristics that makes them compatible to religious study is that each trait is orthogonal, or completely independent from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Funder|first=David C.|title=The personality puzzle|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=9780393933482|pages=243–244|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In having the ability to separate each essential trait from the other, it is possible to study each personality characteristic and how it relates to religiosity.

The idea of studying the [[psychology of religion]] through a personality lens is not a new idea, however.  There has been research to both support and refute the ability of personality traits to explain religious or spiritual involvement. Research using [[Hans Eysenck|Eysenck]]'s model has found that religiosity in general is associated with low openness to experience, as well as low [[psychoticism]],&lt;ref name="psychology of religion"&gt;{{cite journal|first= Robert A.|last=Emmons|author2=Paloutzian, Raymond F. |title=The Psychology of Religion|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|year=2003|volume=54|pages=377–402|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145024|pmid=12171998}}&lt;/ref&gt; a factor associated inversely with agreeableness and conscientiousness.&lt;ref name=Saroglou/&gt; A review of studies examined the relations between the FFM and measures of religiosity, spiritual maturity, religious fundamentalism, and extrinsic religion. General religiosity was mainly related to Agreeableness and Conscientiousness of the big five traits.&lt;ref name=Saroglou&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|title=Religion and the five-factors of personality: A meta-analytic review.|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2002|pages=15–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there was a weak positive association with extraversion, and a very small but significant relationship with low openness to experience. This same study also found that the two different concepts of religiosity and spirituality both involve an overall compassionate attitude towards others and positively correlates with agreeableness. Open, mature religiosity and spirituality were associated with high openness to experience, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, and with low neuroticism. Religious fundamentalism was associated with higher agreeableness, and lower neuroticism and lower openness to experience. Because of these factors, it was also seen that more religious people seem to be altruistic and more well behaved. However, this correlation is pretty small. It is not known if religious people tend to be better behaved or if better behaved people are more attracted to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual Differences and Personality|last=Ashton|first=Michael|publisher=Nikki Levy|year=2018|isbn=978-0-12-809845-5|location=125 London Wall, London EC2Y 5AS, United Kingdom|pages=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extrinsic religiosity was associated with higher neuroticism but unrelated to the other personality factors. All of these relationships between personality and religion were small. This finding does not necessarily support the concept of personality for being the specific reason for religiosity, however this correlation with the FFM can lead to more in depth research on the topic.

===Strengths and weaknesses===
As previously stated, one of the major strengths for using the FFM to study religiosity in people is the how empirically tested, and accurate the measure actually is in accordance to personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costa|first1=P|last2=McCrae|title=The NEO PI-R Professional Manual|journal=The NEO PI-R Professional Manual|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another strength is that the big five is an excellent starting point for beginning to look at links between personality and religiosity because it is simply laid out. While this is a huge strength, some research argues that its downfall lies in that it is solely a personality indicator, and is not compatible with religious or spiritual matters.  For example, in another study that investigated the correlation between religiosity and the FFM, a conclusion was drawn that religiosity and/or spirituality should be made into a sixth personality factor in order to truly make research using this model accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piedmont|first=R|title=Strategies for using the five factor model of personality in religious research|journal=Journal of Psychology and Theology|volume=27|pages=338–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more advances in research using the FFM to study religiosity and spirituality come, there will be a clearer cut answer as to whether there is a significant place for the FFM in studying religious behavior.

==Attachment theory==
[[Attachment Theory]] is another example of a personality indicator with the ability to help researchers understand religiosity and spirituality.  The basic premise of attachment theory is that infants form relationships with their caregivers, and depending on the type of attachment, personality and future relationships will be influenced accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowlby|first=J|title=Attachment and loss: Separation, anxiety and anger|year=1973|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind how the theory relates to the psychology of religion is that these future relationships can be with the particular god, or higher power.

In attachment theory, there have been three attachment styles identified: 1)secure style- confidence in the availability of attachment figures during times of need 2)avoidant style- insecurity and lack of trust in the ability of others to care for one's needs 3) anxious-ambivalent style- view of others as being reluctant to get close to oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by Raymond F. Paloutzian, Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=1-57230-922-9|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research varies in explaining which type of attachment style yields the individual's particular relationship with God.  For example, in one study, a secure relationship with one's parents will translate into a secure attachment to God, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=L|title=God as a substitute attachment figure: a longitudinal study of adult attachment style and religious change in college students.|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1998|volume=24|pages=961–973|doi=10.1177/0146167298249004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other research has showed that there is a compensatory effect, or the need of people to make up for something that is lacking.  For instance, someone with an insecure attachment style with their parents may in turn, have a very secure, and confident relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by Raymond F. Paloutzian, Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=1572309229|pages=256–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strengths and weaknesses===
The idea of being able to link people's religiousness (or lack thereof) with how their attachment with their caregivers was, seems to be a promising field of study.  The obstacle that makes this seemingly simple idea very complicated is that the current data is so skewed.  There are many studies that found there is a direct correspondence from attachment style with caregivers to God, and there are studies who have found more compensatory results.  The inability of researchers to find a general consensus could be a hindrance towards future exploration in this field.

==Object relations theory==
[[Object relations theory]]'s roots lie in children relating or associating different emotions with different people (objects).  The children associate these emotions to the objects based on how they currently view the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kernberg|first=O|title=Structural derivatives of object relationships|journal=International Journal of Psycho-Analysis|pages=236–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, kids will associate the emotion of something good with mother, and bad with something like criminals.  In relating this with religious ideals, it seems natural that the same concept should apply.  One's relationship with God should, in theory, be traced back to association.

In this theory, it is hypothesized that the person ends up creating an idea of God according to what the individual needs, and how he or she perceives the world. This view of personality and religion does not focus on how each person differs trait wise, but it centers on the type of relationship the individual has with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rizzuto|first=A|title=The birth of the living god|year=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strengths and weaknesses===
An important notion to keep in mind with Object Relations theory is that it is highly theoretical.  This is a weakness in the sense that all data is based on a concept that cannot be objectively verified, and thus creates a confound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lilienfeld|first=S |author2=Wood, J |author3=Garb, H|title=The scientific status of projective tests|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|year=2000|doi= 10.1111/1529-1006.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all inquiries about the psychological nature of religion, it is difficult to find extremely valid and reliable measures because of the introspective nature of the subject.  That being said, there is something that we can learn from this field of study.  By analyzing how this theory of personality development correlates with one's attachment to a religious deity, we can hopefully begin to understand how important association, and perception is to religious ideals.

== Religious struggles and personality ==
Research has shown that struggles with religion correlates to basic personality traits. Studies on [[Big Five personality traits|The Big Five Factors of Personality]], as well as factors such as self-compassion, self-esteem, and entitlement, suggest that there is a significant relationship between religious uncertainty and personality.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;http://sites.nd.edu/lapseylab/files/2016/08/Grubbs_etal_SelfStruggleAndSoul_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are high in neuroticism may have a hard time trying to find purpose in their life. This correlates with divine struggles as they may encounter distress when it comes to finding the meaning of life as well as recognizing divine figures of religions. Extroversion, however, has not been linked through research or studies with religious struggles. Very little evidence is available to suggest that openness to experience is linked to religious struggles, but it is thought that those who are high in openness to experience may carry more doubt in religion compared to those who are lower in openness to experience. Both agreeableness and conscientiousness have been associated with possible animosity towards God or other divine figures.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  It has also been found that religious people are more likely to avoid risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929119916300013?via%3Dihub|title=Does local religiosity matter for bank risk-taking?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11166-013-9174-8|title=Risk aversion and religion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion and life satisfaction ==
Research done by Salsman, Brown, Brechting, and Carlson showed a positive correlation between religion and life satisfaction of about 0.2 to 0.3. It was shown by Salsman that those who practice religion have a generally more positive outlook on life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Individual Differences in Personality|last1=Ashton|first1=Michael C|date=2018|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-809845-5|edition=Third|pages=310–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many elements of religion have been studied to determine which aspects impacts one's life satisfaction. It was found that both personal and organizational religion can lead to an increased life satisfaction. Individual prayer, a feeling of intimacy with the divine, and meditation were all linked to greater psychological well-being and life satisfaction. When it came to organizational religion, people felt a greater satisfaction knowing that they belonged to a group, had a support system from the church, and felt fulfilled when they increased their participation within the church's community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elliot|first1=Marta|last2=Hayward|first2=R. David|date=October 1, 2009|title=Relgion and Life Satisfaction Worldwide: The Role of Government Regulation|url=https://academic.oup.com/socrel/article/70/3/285/1652126|journal=Sociology of Religion|volume=70|issue=3|pages=285–310|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who feel conflicted about religion may encounter a decline in their health, both mentally and physically. Research has shown that those who have religious struggles could have higher depression and anxiety levels. The risk of suicide is even elevated when struggle is present within religion. These struggles have been linked to a separation from the church or the divine; however the cause for the separation is unknown and may stem from different events throughout life such as a traumatic death in the family, difficult life events, or a mental battle between oneself. More research is needed to validate the causes of religious separation and how it effect one's personality.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Religion and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ==
The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]], or MBTI, uses four dichotomies to indicate a person's psychological preference. When used in studies alongside religion, it has been shown that introverted types (primarily ISTJ and INTJ) are more likely to be atheist. However, a large portion of Greek Orthodox is ISTJ as well. In addition, the "judging" (J) type is common among evangelical and Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scienceonreligion.org/index.php/news-research/research-updates/573-the-personality-types-of-christians-and-atheists&lt;/ref&gt;  ESFJ and ENFJ personality types are more interested in becoming ministers than other type. ENFJs are more attracted to becoming ministers of liberal denominations, while ESFJs are more interested in becoming ministers in conservative denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1957.tb00074.x|title=EVIDENCE BEARING ON USE OF THE MYERS‐BRIGGS TYPE INDICATOR TO SELECT PERSONS FOR ADVANCED RELIGIOUS TRAINING: A PRELIMINARY REPORT}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that the Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator, although popular, is flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pittenger|first1=David|title=Measuring the MBTI... And Coming Up Short|journal=Journal of Career Planning &amp; Placement|issue=Fall 1993|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/Articles/develop/mbti.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religiosity and paranormal beliefs ==
Most religions are based around a belief in some sort of supernatural being. This may lead some to believe that the characteristic of being religious would relate in someway to the characteristic of believing in other paranormal beings. However, multiple studies have found no correlation between these two characteristics. This could be due to the fact that many religions discourage their members from thinking too much of paranormal beings, as they are thought to be evil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In conclusion, paranormal beliefs are probably not highly related to personality traits.

== Religion as a personality characteristic ==
While there are many who believe religion has a strong influence on personality development, some believe it may be a personality trait on its own. Vassilis Saroglou, for example,  has developed on the idea by introducing four traits of personality that religion develop: believing, bonding, behaving, and belonging. Believing refers to someone accepting the belief in a supernatural being or world. Bonding is how important religion is to the self and how it connects them to something larger than themselves. Behaving is how someone changes their own lifestyle to appease their spiritual beliefs. Belonging is the identity one acquires from believing in a religion. This concept, published in 2011, easily applies to religion cross-culturally and to a wide range of spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|date=September 2, 2011|title=Believing, Bonding, Behaving, and Belonging - The Big Four Religious Dimensions and Cultural Variation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022111412267|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |volume=42|pages=1320–1340|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiated by [[Humberto Maturana]] in 1978 with the publication of his [[Humberto_Maturana#Publications|Biology of Cognition]], his subsequent work in partnership with [[Francisco Varela]] in Santiago, Chile, eventually came to be called the '''Santiago theory of cognition.''' They and their work, their cohorts and like-minded intellectuals similarly came to be known as the Santiago School.&lt;ref&gt;Capra, Fritjof. "The Santiago Theory of Life and Cognition." la revista Be-Vision 9.1 (1986): 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory can be encapsulated in two sentences:&lt;blockquote&gt;Living systems are cognitive systems, and living as a process is a process of cognition. This statement is valid for all organisms, with or without a nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;Maturana, Humberto R./Varela, Francisco J. (1980): Autopoiesis and Cognition. The Realization of the Living. Dordrecht: Reidel, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This theory contributes a perspective that cognition is a process present at other organic levels.

The Santiago theory of cognition is a direct theoretical consequence of the theory of [[autopoiesis]]. Cognition is considered as ''the ability of [[adaptation]] in a certain environment''. That definition is not as strange as it seems at first glance: for example, one is considered to have a good knowledge of Mathematics if they can understand and subsequently solve a Mathematical problem. That is, one can recognize the mathematical entities, their interrelations and the procedures used to view other aspects of the relevant phenomena; all these, are the domain of Mathematics. And one with knowledge of that domain, is one adapted to that domain, for they can tweak the problems, the entities and the procedures within the certain domain.

Cognition emerges as a consequence of continuous interaction between the system and its environment. The continuous interaction triggers bilateral [[Perturbation (biology)|perturbation]]s; perturbations are considered problems – therefore the system uses its functional differentiation procedures to come up with a [[solution]] (if it doesn't have one handy already through its memory). Gradually the system becomes "adapted" to its environment – that is it can confront the perturbations so as to survive. The resulting complexity of [[living system]]s is cognition produced by the history of bilateral perturbations within the system/environment schema.

This theory contributes to the philosophical discussion of [[awareness]], [[consciousness]], [[cognition]] and the [[philosophy of mind]].

To better understand and breakdown the concept of social inequity aversion would be to use the study done by [[Sarah Brosnan]] (as well as with Frans B. M. de Waal),&lt;ref name=Henrich&gt;[[Joseph Henrich|Henrich, Joseph]].[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v428/n6979/full/428139a.html#B1 "Animal Behaviour (Communication Arising): Inequity Aversion in Capuchins?"] 11 March 2004.

Of the female monkeys, two received the same reward, one female received a superior reward, one female received a superior reward without exchange (for example without work), and a single female observed a superior reward in the absence of a partner.&lt;ref name=Mardle&gt;Mardle, Earl. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220022206/http://www.kn.com.au/networks/2003/09/inequity_aversi.html "Inequity Aversion – Even a Monkey Can Pick a Raw Deal"]. A Networked World. Retrieved 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The females were much less likely to complete a trade with the human experimenter when their corresponding partner received a food item of higher value item (a grape; the lower item was a cucumber&lt;ref name=Henrich /&gt;), and when that partner received the higher food item with no exchange of work of any kind, the likelihood of not completing a trade intensified.&lt;ref name=Mardle /&gt; All of these refusals of exchange included both passive and active rejections ranging from refusing to take the awards to throwing the reward, respectively. These negative responses of situation made with the monkeys support the early evolutionary origin of [[inequity aversion]]&lt;ref name=Mardle /&gt; and thus helps (in combination with the definitions of inequity and aversion) give an overall idea of what social inequity aversion is: the tendency to reject or avoid situations in which there is [[social inequality]], unfairness, or injustice.

==In humans==
It is important to note that the experiment was done with capuchin monkeys and not humans, and because humans are not the only cooperative animals (monkeys being one of many examples), we cannot assume that inequity aversion is an exclusive human trait or nature.&lt;ref&gt;Brosnan, Sarah and de Waal, Frans B. M. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6955/abs/nature01963.html#a1 "Monkeys Reject Unequal Pay"]. 23 July 2003. ''Nature''. Issue 428. Retrieved 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been other experiments done with humans to test the validity of the inequity aversion theory proposed by Brosnan and de Waal. An experiment performed by Urs Fischbacher, Christina M. Fong, and Ernst Fehr called "Fairness, Errors, and the Power of Competition"&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Ernst. Fischbacher, Urs. Fong, Christina M. [http://www.iew.unizh.ch/wp/iewwp133.pdf "Fairness, Errors, and the Power of Competition"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630134015/http://www.iew.unizh.ch/wp/iewwp133.pdf |date=2007-06-30 }}. Institute for Empirical Research in Economics. University of Zurich. December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; consisted of a multi-lateral ultimatum game where one contestant was put up against multiple ones.&lt;ref name=Henrich /&gt; In this experiment when the responders accepts the offer from the person giving the reward (say the 'provider'), the person giving the reward (the provider) gets his full pay. The key to this experiment is that the ability of one responder to affect the pay of the provider is lessened by all of the other responders' willingness to accept the reward. As a result, the concept of inequity aversion is followed, which says that the responders' willingness to reject the reward is lessened as well as the providers' offers.&lt;ref name=Henrich /&gt; (This is because in order to evade inequality or injustice due to unequal pay, all of the participants reduce their amounts to reduce the chance of unfairness). What's most important to realize in this experiment is that the outcome does not seem to agree with those of Brosnan and de Waal's capuchin experiment; humans will not reject the offer unless it affects others reward and/or pay.&lt;ref name=Henrich /&gt; So for humans, the original Fehr-Schmidt inequity aversion model, which was cited by Brosnan and de Waal in their capuchin experiment saying that the capuchin monkeys should always eat the lower value food, seems to hold validity. By not rejecting the reward offered, the humans decreased the amount of inequality. This was the opposite for the capuchins as they rejected the lower value food (cucumbers) when they couldn't get the higher value food (grapes) thus increasing the inequality, especially when the capuchins who received the grapes stole the discarded cucumbers, leaving the other monkeys with nothing. That increased the amount of inequality among the capuchins—The humans would only reject the reward if it reduced the reward of the individual who received the most.&lt;ref name=Henrich /&gt;

==Combining with social inequality==
According to Sarah Brosnan, "human beings have a similar approach, we do not live in a world of absolute values but one in which we are constantly comparing ourselves with those about us and, like a capuchin, we can tell when we are being short changed".&lt;ref name=Mardle /&gt; This can directly be connected to social inequality in that we as humans know what social inequality is and can identify it as an injustice; it is how we know that something such as unequal pay based on socioeconomic status is social inequality. However, according to the concept of social inequity aversion, we will not reject what is offered to us unless we realize that by rejecting what we are offered we will reduce another person's earnings or the earnings of the person who is giving to us, thus making our earnings closer to theirs, thus lessening the inequality.

One key example that links these two concepts could be that of the Neoclassical labor-market theory. Based on several important facts, this theory is based on the supposition that "(1) a relatively free and open market exists in which individuals compete for position. (2) Position in that markets depends heavily on the individual's efforts, abilities, experience, training, or '[[human capital]].' (3) There are automatic mechanisms that operate in the marketplace to ensure that imbalances between one's input (human capital) and one's rewards (wages) are corrected in a way to restore balance" (Hurst 231).&lt;ref name=Hurst&gt;Hurst, Charles E. ''Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequence''. 6th Ed. Pearson Education, Inc. USA. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is interesting in that the third fact that is assumed to be true in a labor-market theory would apply greatly to the concept of social inequity aversion. This is because it would seem that in order to get the reward that is expected we as people will take what is given to us for our skill. But when it becomes possible that our fellow citizen can get more than us, or that the company that is providing us with the reward (payments) gets more money from our labor/skill, then we as people in this labor market theory will reject the payments, and try to obtain a better one. We do this by trying to attain better resources for ourselves, such as "education, training, skills, and intelligence" (Hurst 231).&lt;ref name=Hurst /&gt; So take for example an African American woman, she will take the payment that all African American women are receiving. But once another African American woman begins to get better payment: via her better resources, other African American women will reject their current position as well as resources and seek more to in order to, maybe not directly lessen the payment that other African American woman, but to get more for themselves. This greatly illustrates the social inequity aversion concept when it comes to humans and how it crosses with the neoclassical labor market theory. However, because it is a continuous process in which different opportunities open up doors for individuals based on their life changes and access to better resources, an imbalance is made and a gap develops, thus separating individuals and creating ongoing social inequality (Hurst 231).&lt;ref name=Hurst /&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a [[semigroup]] is a [[nonempty set]] together with an [[associative]] [[binary operation]]. A '''special class of semigroups'''  is a [[Class (set theory)|class]] of [[semigroup]]s satisfying additional [[property (philosophy)|properties]] or conditions. Thus the class of [[commutative]] semigroups consists of all those semigroups in which the binary operation satisfies the commutativity property that ''ab'' = ''ba'' for all elements ''a'' and ''b'' in the semigroup.
The class of [[Finite set|finite]] semigroups consists of those semigroups for which the [[underlying set]] has finite [[cardinality]]. Members of the class of [[Brandt semigroup]]s are required to satisfy not just one condition but a set of additional properties. A large collection of special classes of semigroups have been defined though not all of them have been studied equally intensively.

In the [[algebra]]ic [[theory]] of semigroups, in constructing special classes, attention is focused only on those properties, restrictions and conditions which can be expressed in terms of the binary operations in the semigroups and occasionally on the cardinality and similar properties of [[subset]]s of the [[underlying set]].  The underlying [[set (mathematics)|sets]] are not assumed to carry any other mathematical [[structure]]s like [[Partial order|order]] or [[topology]].

As in any algebraic theory,  one of the main problems of the theory of semigroups is the [[classification theorems|classification]] of all semigroups and a complete description of their structure. In the case of semigroups, since the binary operation is required to satisfy only the associativity property the problem of classification is considered extremely difficult. Descriptions of structures have been obtained for certain special classes of semigroups. For example, the structure of the sets of idempotents of regular semigroups is completely known. Structure descriptions are presented in terms of better known types of semigroups. The best known type of semigroup is the [[Group (mathematics)|group]].

A (necessarily incomplete) list of various special classes of semigroups is presented below. To the extent possible the defining properties are formulated in terms of the binary operations in the semigroups. The references point to the locations from where the defining properties are sourced.

For example, the definition ''xab'' = ''xba'' should be read as:
*There exists ''x'' an element of the semigroup such that, for each ''a'' and ''b'' in the semigroup, ''xab'' and ''xba'' are equal.

== List of special classes of semigroups ==
The third column states whether this set of semigroups forms a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]]. And whether the set of finite semigroups of this special class forms a [[variety of finite semigroups]]. Note that if this set is a variety, its set of finite elements is automatically a variety of finite semigroups.

French translation by Jean de Vignay, Bruges, c. 1478-1480, for [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]];[[British Library]]]]

The medieval genre of '''speculum literature''', popular from the twelfth through the sixteenth centuries, was inspired by the urge to encompass [[encyclopedia|encyclopedic]] knowledge within a single work.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ritamary "Backgrounds of the Title Speculum in Mediaeval Literature" ''Speculum'' '''29'''.1 (January 1954), pp. 100-115.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some of these works have a restricted scope and function as instructional manuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Franklin-Brown | first = Mary | title = Reading the world : encyclopedic writing in the scholastic age | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago London | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780226260709|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense encyclopedias and speculum are similar but they are not the same genre.{{sfn|Franklin-Brown|2012|p=273}} Some{{who|date=August 2018}} have suggested that the modern equivalent is a summary ''survey'', in the sense of a [[survey article]] in a scholarly journal that summarizes a field of research.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source as some medieval genres have no modern equivalent.|date=January 2018}}

==''Specula'' as a genre==
''Specula'' often offered mirrors of history, doctrine, or morals. [[Vincent of Beauvais]]' [[Speculum Maius]] which included the ''Mirror of Nature'', ''Mirror of History'', and ''Mirror of Doctrine'' is not often described as a core representative of the genre. One historian has surmised that this is because Vincent's work was intended to be an objective work which is at odds with ''speculum'' literature, since it "is a subjective genre".{{sfn|Franklin-Brown|2012|p=273}} More usual members are found in this list: 

* [[Honorius Augustodunensis]]' ''Imago mundi'' (cited by [[Vincent of Beauvais]] as ''Speculum mundi''){{sfn|Franklin-Brown|2012|p=273}} and ''Speculum Ecclesiae''{{sfn|Franklin-Brown|2012|p=273}} (different than the ''Speculum Ecclesiae'' by [[Edmund Rich]])

* ''[[Speculum ecclesiae]]'', the "Mirror of the Church", written by [[Edmund Rich]].

* ''[[Speculum stultorum]]'', the "Mirror of Fools" written by [[Nigel de Longchamps]]

''[[Ormulum]]'', written by a certain Orm in Central England, bears an indirect reference to ''speculum'' and may be translated as "Orm's Mirror". It is universal in contents in that it contains the appropriate [[homily|homiletic]] materials throughout the Church calendar.

The English word ''mirror'' appears in [[William Caxton]]'s ''Myrrour of the Worlde'' (1490), one of the first illustrated books printed in English (a translation of ''[[L'image du Monde]]'', an overview of the sciences); in the oft-republished ''[[A Mirror for Magistrates]]'' (1559); and in ''[[The Miroir or Glasse of the Synneful Soul]]'', a manuscript translation from the French by the young Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]]. ''[[The Mirror of Simple Souls]]'' is a modern English translation of a similar French work.

The ''Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae'' ("Mirror of the Magnificence of Rome") was a Renaissance "[[coffee table book]]" of prints of the sights of Rome, especially the antiquities, produced by the French print seller and publisher [[Antonio Lafreri]] (1512–1577). He had been publishing and distributing such prints, and selling them at his shop in Rome, since the 1540s. In the 1570s he hit on the idea of producing a title page for the albums of prints he also sold.  Each copy of the ''Speculum'' may have had different contents, as the customer in Rome could make his own selection in the shop and have them bound up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/content/introduction.html ''Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae''], ''University of Chicago Library''&lt;/ref&gt;     

In modern times, the journal ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'', published by the Medieval Academy of America, covers every aspect of the medieval world.

'''Stacey Cornell Koon''' (born November 23, 1950) is a former [[sergeant]] with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] who became nationally notorious in the wake of the [[Rodney King]] incident.

==Rodney King incident==
On March 3, 1991, in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], a high-speed chase was initiated by [[California Highway Patrol]] officer Melanie Singer after motorist Rodney King was observed behind the wheel of a 1988 white [[Hyundai]] Excel traveling at a high speed of over 100 MPH. The chase ended on the right shoulder of Foothill Boulevard. Koon and four other officers ([[Laurence Powell]], Timothy Wind, Theodore Briseño and Rolando Solano) attempted to arrest King. The officers stated that King resisted arrest and Officers Powell, Wind and Briseño had to use force to subdue him. The incident was videotaped by a nearby resident, George Holliday, who sold it to local TV station [[KTLA]]. The station aired parts of the video and [[CNN]] aired it the next day. The police officers were tried for the use of excessive force in state court in [[Simi Valley]] in 1992 and acquitted on April 29 that year. Later the same day the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] erupted, which went on to claim the lives of sixty-three people. In 1993, the four officers were tried in a federal court in [[Los Angeles]]; Koon and Powell were convicted of violating King's civil rights and sentenced to 30 months in prison.

In his 1992 book, ''Presumed Guilty: The Tragedy of the Rodney King Affair'', Koon defended his actions and blamed the riots on the media and community leaders.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1614117_1614084_1614512,00.html|title=STACEY KOON - The L.A.

The initial sentencing of officers Powell and Koon was appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]] on the issue of whether the Federal District Court properly applied departures from the [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] when it granted two downward departures to 30 months from section 242 of the sentencing guidelines, in ''Koon v. United States'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-1664.ZS.html 518 US 81 (1996)]. 

In November 1995, a gunman, 35-year old Randall Tolbert, entered the halfway house and demanded to know where Koon was. Koon was on a holiday pass at the time. The gunman took three hostages, one of whom, 67-year old Karl Milan, he later shot and killed before being killed himself by the sheriff's [[SWAT]] team during a shootout.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-24/news/mn-6703_1_halfway-house&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Koon eventually moved to [[Castaic, California|Castaic]], north of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Time http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1614117_1614084_1614512,00.html#ixzz0ebcBK1G8&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he began working as a chauffeur in Los Angeles for the limousine company Music Express where his patrons have included notable people like former vice president [[Al Gore]] and actor and political commentator [[D. L. Hughley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/8327-al-gores-limo-driver-was-former-lapd-officer-in-rodney-king-beating-video|title=Al Gore's Limo Driver Was Former LAPD Officer In Rodney King Beating Video|last=|first=|date=2014-05-22|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=May 1, 2015 |access-date=May 4, 2015 |series=Real Time with Bill Maher |network=HBO |season=13 |number=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Koon and his fellow [[LAPD]] officer [[Laurence Powell]] have been used as symbols of racism in hip hop and related music. He is referenced by [[rap metal]] band [[Rage Against the Machine]] in their song "Vietnow", from their 1996 album, ''[[Evil Empire (album)|Evil Empire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rage Against the Machine. ''Evil Empire''. Epic EK 57523, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also mentioned in the [[Ice Cube]] song "[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]" from his 1993 album ''Lethal Injection''. Koon was also namechecked in ''[[The Simpsons|The Simpsons']]'' episode "[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]" by conservative commentator [[Birch Barlow]] as an example of someone "railroaded by our liberal justice system." As well, he was parodied twice in 1993 by [[Jim Carrey]] on the American sketch comedy television series ''[[In Living Color]]''.

==Education==
Koon has a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in criminal justice from California State University in Los Angeles, and a master's degree in public administration from the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Presumed Guilty: The Tragedy of the Rodney King Affair |last=Koon |first=Stacey C. |author2=Robert Deitz  |year=1992 |publisher=Regnery Gateway |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=9780895265074 |oclc=26553041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stewardship cessation''' is a concept useful in [[system engineering]]. Certain [[systems]] remain hazardous for a considerable period after their useful life, and will usually be managed to ensure that the public and the environment is not exposed to the hazard. It is incumbent on the [[systems designer]] to consider the outcome should this stewardship be discontinued for any reason, and to design a system which is as robust as possible in the event of stewardship cessation.

==Examples==
===Nuclear industry===
The most obvious example is the [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] industry, and the [[radioactive waste]] it generates which will be a hazard for many centuries. In the present era, most high level waste is in still in currently managed facilities, but various methods are being considered for disposal. Most of the proposed disposal methods are designed to put the waste in a place so isolated from the environment that (it is hoped) immediate stewardship cessation would be safe and appropriate. However, many people are more comfortable with systems where the waste is still accessible, so that if there is an unforeseen problem with the disposal method, the waste can still be accessed to rectify the problem. These systems will still require some level of stewardship, but the system designer must consider that this may not be available for the hundreds of years required.

===Satellites===
Another example is when [[geostationary]] [[telecommunication|communication]]s satellites reach the end of their useful lives. Stewardship cessation will occur hopefully in a planned manner, where the operator will move the [[satellite]] to a somewhat higher orbit to minimise the risk that the satellite will be a collision hazard to other satellites in the geostationary arc (graveyard burn). Unplanned stewardship cessation will occur if telecommand access to the satellite's systems is cut off due to a failure, for instance in the telecommand receivers.

==Reasons==
Reasons for stewardship cessation include:

*Illegal or inappropriate disposal by the last user
*Unreasonable budgetary constraints from government or other body
*Total societal breakdown or partial sociocultural change leading to a reduction in the perceived need for stewardship or simply to negligence
*[[Climate change]] putting the system beyond reach (under sea or ice)
*[[Global war]]
*Other catastrophe (e.g. epidemic) reducing the number of available stewards (''i.e.'', number of humans * fraction of humans able [or, in free societies, both able and willing] to provide stewardship services) below the threshold necessary to maintain a continuous-stewardship system
*For remotely operated systems, loss of communication with the remote segment of the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4386">A '''sustainable community energy system''' is an integrated approach to supplying a local community with its energy requirements from [[renewable energy]] or high-efficiency [[co-generation]] energy sources. The approach can be seen as a development of the [[distributed generation]] concept.

Such systems are based on a combination of [[district heating]], [[district cooling]], plus '[[electricity generation island]]s' that are interlinked via a private wire electricity system (largely bypassing the normal [[power grid]] to cut transmission losses and charges, as well as increasing the robustness of the system). The surplus from one generating island can therefore be used to make up the deficit at another.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] the first sustainable community energy system was pioneered by [[Woking]] [[Borough]] [[Municipality|Council]], starting in 1991. The system uses traditional and a [[Phosphoric-acid fuel cell|phosphoric acid fuel cell]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060911140743/http://www.woking.gov.uk/html/queensaward/W-19.pdf] co-generation plants, [[thermal store|thermal storage]], heat fired [[absorption cooling]] and [[photovoltaics]] (over 9% of the UK's small capacity), to supply both residential and non-residential customers, as well as the Council's own facilities. By end of 2005 there were over 60 generating islands in the Borough.

Despite the investment in the plant, the system delivers cheaper energy than can be supplied from the traditional 'brown energy' suppliers, helping to tackle [[fuel poverty]]. It is part of a plan to cut local [[carbon dioxide]] emissions by 80% by 2050. Their initiatives won the Council the [[Queen's Award for Enterprise]] in 2002 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070102051259/http://www.woking.gov.uk/news/archive?item=988025744].

The [[London Climate Change Agency]] is starting to construct a similar system in [[London]].

==Germany==
In 1997, people of [[Wildpoldsried]], in some cases acting as individuals, began a series of projects that produce renewable energy. The first efforts were [[wind turbine]]s and [[biomass]] digesters for [[cogeneration]] of heat and power.  In the time since, new work has included a number of [[energy conservation]] projects, more wind and biomass use, [[small hydro]] plants, [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic panels]] on private houses, and [[district heating]].  Tied to this are ecological [[flood control]] and [[wastewater]] systems.

Today, the effects of this are an unforeseen level of prosperity resulting in construction of nine new community buildings, including a school, gymnasium, and community hall, complete with solar panels.  There are three companies operating four biogas digesters with a fifth under construction.  There are seven windmills with two more on the way. One hundred and ninety private households are equipped with solar, which pays them dividends.  The district heating network has 42 connections.  There are three small hydro power plants. Wildpoldsried now produces 321 percent more energy than it needs and is generating 4.0 million Euro in annual revenue.  At the same time, there has been a 65% reduction in the town’s carbon footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=German Village Achieves Energy Independence … And Then Some  |publisher=BioCycle |date=August 2011 |volume= 52, No. 8, p. 37 |url=http://www.biocycle.net/2011/08/german-village-achieves-energy-independence-and-then-some/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms '''transition town''', '''transition initiative''' and '''transition model''' refer to [[grassroots|grassroot]] [[community project]]s that aim to increase  self-sufficiency to reduce the potential effects of [[peak oil]],{{r|WithoutOil}} [[climate destruction]], and economic instability.{{r|guardian13}} The '''Transition Network''', founded in 2006, inspired the creation of many of the projects. A number of the groups are officially registered with the Transition Network.{{r|what}} The first initiative to use the name was Transition Town Totnes, located in the United Kingdom. Transition initiatives have been started in locations around the world, with many located in the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and Australia.&lt;ref name=guardian13 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transitionnetwork.org/initiatives/map|title=Transition Initiatives Map - Transition Network|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term, "transition town" was coined by Louise Rooney&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localplanet.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=191&amp;Itemid=49|title=The Local Planet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Catherine Dunne.

The transition model can be applied to different types of places where people live, such as villages, regions, islands and towns. The generic term is "transition initiative", which includes transition neighborhoods, communities, and cities, although "transition town" is in common usage.&lt;ref name="12Ingredients" /&gt;

== History ==

===From Kinsale to Totnes===
[[Image:Totnes High Street.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Totnes]], [[Devon]], England: a transition town]]
In 2004, [[permaculture]] designer [[Rob Hopkins]] set his students at [[Kinsale]] Further Education College the task of applying permaculture principles to the concept of [[peak oil]]. The output of this student project was the ‘Kinsale Energy Descent Action Plan'.&lt;ref name=KinsaleEDAP&gt;{{cite web|title=Kinsale 2021 An Energy Descent Action Plan – Version.1. 2005|url=http://transitionculture.org/wp-content/uploads/KinsaleEnergyDescentActionPlan.pdf|publisher=Kinsale Further Education College|accessdate=16 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316182454/http://transitionculture.org/wp-content/uploads/KinsaleEnergyDescentActionPlan.pdf|archivedate=16 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This looked at across-the-board creative adaptations in the realms of energy production, health, education, economy and agriculture as a "road map" to a sustainable future for the town. Two of his students, Louise Rooney and Catherine Dunne, developed the ''Transition towns'' concept.  They then presented their ideas to Kinsale Town Council. The councilors decided to adopt the plan and work towards energy independence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Hopkins moved to his hometown of [[Totnes]], [[England]], where he and Naresh Giangrande developed these concepts into the transition model.  In 2006 Transition Town Totnes become the first Transition initiative.&lt;ref name=TodayTotnes&gt;{{cite web|title=The Transition movement: Today Totnes... tomorrow the world|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/the-transition-movement-today-totnes-tomorrow-the-world-2364355.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition Network founded===
[[File:Rob Hopkins, Transition Network.webm|thumb|[[Permaculture]] designer [[Rob Hopkins]] in conversation with [[Silver Donald Cameron]] about Transition Towns.]]
Between late 2006 and early 2007 the Transition Network UK charity was co-founded by [[permaculture]] educator Rob Hopkins, Peter Lipman and Ben Brangwyn. Totnes based, it was initiated to support the Transition initiatives emerging around the world. It trains and supports people involved with the initiatives. It also disseminates the concepts of transition towns.&lt;ref name=AboutTN /&gt;

===2008 to present day===
In 2008, the number of communities involved in the project had increased with many localities in the process of becoming "official" Transition towns.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_358524"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/news/358524 |title=Money for climate project |date=10 April 2008 |work=[[The Nelson Mail]] |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative spread and by May 2010 there were over 400 community initiatives recognized as official Transition towns in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United States]], [[Italy]] and [[Chile]]. The term ''transition initiatives'' became common to reflect the range and type of communities involved - e.g. villages ([[Kinsale#Transition towns|Kinsale]]), neighbourhoods of cities ([[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello]], Edinburgh), through council districts ([[Penwith]]) to cities and city boroughs ([[Brixton]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transitionnetwork.org/initiatives|title=Transition Initiatives Directory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Portobello&gt;{{cite web|title=About PEDAL|url=http://www.pedal-porty.org.uk/what-is-pedal/|publisher=Portobello Transition Town|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 2013, there were 1130 initiatives registered (462 Official, 654 Muller) in 43 countries.&lt;ref name=Statistics&gt;{{cite web|title=Transition Initiatives Directory|url=http://www.transitionnetwork.org/initiatives|publisher=Transition Network|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Influences include [[permaculture]] concepts as described in [[Bill Mollison]]’s ''Permaculture, a Designers Manual (1988)'' and [[David Holmgren]]’s ''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability (2003),''&lt;ref name=Permaculture&gt;{{cite web|title=Permaculture |url=http://www.transitiontownashland.org/Permaculture.html |publisher=Transition Town Ashland |accessdate=16 March 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204110334/http://www.transitiontownashland.org/Permaculture.html |archivedate=February 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[David Fleming (writer)|David Fleming]]'s work on community, culture and resilience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/other_comments/700941/dr_david_fleming_a_tribute.html David Fleming obituary in ''The Ecologist'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Each transition town or initiative has a high level of [[autonomy]]. However, to be called an official initiative certain criteria must be met. Additionally, there is nothing to stop an 'unofficial' initiative using ideas inspired by Transition towns. Further, there are various 'hubs' to co-ordinate work at a regional level.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Transition Network===
The Transition Network (TN) is a UK charity set up to support Transition initiatives. It has published books and films, trained people and facilitated [[social network|networking]].&lt;ref name=AboutTN /&gt; The TN's website contains a listing of the initiatives that have registered, some of which are officially recognised.&lt;ref name=dir /&gt;

===Transition US===
In the United States, transition initiatives have been started in many communities. Transition US is the national hub. Its stated vision ''"that every community in the United States will have engaged its collective creativity to unleash an extraordinary and historic transition to a future beyond fossil fuels; a future that is more vibrant, abundant and resilient; one that is ultimately preferable to the present"''.&lt;ref name=OurStory&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Story|url=http://transitionus.org/our-story|publisher=Transition US|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transition US is a resource and catalyst for building resilient communities across the United States that are able to withstand severe energy, climate, or economic shocks while creating a better quality of life in the process. They are accomplishing this mission by inspiring, encouraging, supporting, networking and training individuals and their communities as they consider, adopt, adapt, and implement the transition approach to community empowerment and change.&lt;ref name=TransitionUS&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://transitionus.org/about-us|publisher=Transition US|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of state sites have also been set up using the [[Ning (website)|Ning social networking platform]]. These state sites, under the umbrella of a national Ning site, were set up to help facilitate, network, inform, monitor, and house regional and organizational transition initiatives.  Thus, furthering the spread of the transition movement while networking related organizations, projects, ideas and activities. In addition, many transition initiatives can be found on the [[WiserEarth]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiserearth.org/group/search?phrase=transition|title=Transition Initiative Groups on WiserEarth.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guidance for new groups===
Some projects use the TN's guide the '12 ingredients', or the 'revised ingredients', when setting up their group.&lt;ref name=12Ingredients&gt;{{cite web|title=12 Ingredients|url=http://www.transitionnetwork.org/support/12-ingredients|publisher=Transition Network|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ingredients&gt;{{cite web|title=Ingredients|url=http://www.transitionnetwork.org/ingredients|publisher=Transition Network|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The Transition Network (TN) promotes awareness of sustainable living and building local [[Resilience (ecology)|ecological resilience]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Peak oil and local resilience===
''The Transition Handbook: From Oil Dependency to Local Resiliency'' by Rob Hopkins provides much of the framework behind the Transition Initiative and outlines ways for local Transition Towns to get involved.&lt;ref name="Handbook" /&gt;

===Transportation===
Communities are encouraged to seek out methods for reducing energy usage as well as reducing their reliance on long supply chains that are totally dependent on fossil fuels for essential items (see [[Sustainable transport#Environmental calculator of the French environment and energy agency|environmental calculator]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Food production===
Food is a key area for transition, sometimes the slogan "Food feet, not [[food miles]]" is used. Initiatives so far have included creating [[community garden]]s or replacing ornamental tree plantings with fruit or nut trees, to grow food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warhurst|first1=Pamela|last2=Dobson|first2=Joanna|title=Plant Veg, Grow a Revolution!|date=May 26, 2014|publisher=Matador Publishing|isbn=1783064870|pages=200|url=https://www.amazon.com/Incredible-Plant-Veg-Grow-Revolution-ebook/dp/B00KLL9DUQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467768036&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=plant+veg%2C+dobson#nav-subnav}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste and recycling===
Business waste exchange seeks to match the waste of one industry with another industry that uses that waste material, sometimes referred to as [[industrial symbiosis]]. This process can help companies increase profitability by reducing raw material and waste disposal cost, reducing carbon emission,  making their byproducts a source of revenue to be bought by other business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://environment.yale.edu/yer/article/industrial-waste-account-to-boost-industrial-symbiosis#gsc.tab=0|title=Industrial waste account to boost industrial symbiosis {{!}} Yale Environment Review|website=environment.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/what-industrial-symbiosis|title=What is industrial symbiosis? {{!}} WRAP UK|date=2013-03-15|website=www.wrap.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=May 2017|reason=Requires reference to link industrial symbiosis to Transition towns}}  Repairing old items rather than throwing them away is looked at.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Psychology===
The Transition Network proposes an alternative from business as usual, or from 'shocked/doomladen' reactions to [[peak oil]] and an end to unlimited economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090320104427/http://transitionculture.org/wp-content/uploads/who_we_are_high.pdf Who we are and what we do] by Rob Hopkins and Peter Lipman. Transition Network. February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Southend-on-Sea in Transition, ''"...by shifting our mind-set we can actually recognise the coming post-cheap oil era as an opportunity rather than a threat, and design the future low carbon age to be thriving, resilient and abundant — somewhere much better to live than our current alienated consumer culture based on greed, war and the myth of perpetual growth."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transitionwestcliff.org.uk/ |title=LIFE BEYOND OIL – THREAT OR OPPORTUNITY? |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818022056/http://www.transitionwestcliff.org.uk/ |archivedate=August 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theme of the Transition Network is acknowledging the emotional impact of changing to a low energy world. Some Transition Network groups have 'Heart and Soul' groups to look at this aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transitiontowntotnes.org/groups/inner-transition/|title=Inner Transition|publisher=Transition Town Totnes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedirt.org/node/3702 |title=Heart and Soul Transition PDX Working Group Meeting #3 - The Dirt! |date=14 November 2010 |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114044157/http://www.thedirt.org/node/3702 |archivedate=November 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy descent action plans (EDAP)===
An important aim for Transition towns is to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. One way to further this goal is for the community to develop an EDAP. The term "community" in this context includes local people, local institutions, local agencies and the local council.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}  The first comprehensive plan was created for Totnes in 2010, entitled ''Transition in Action: Totnes &amp; District 2030''.&lt;ref name=edap /&gt;

In [[France]], where the movement is called ''Villes et Territoires en Transition'', the [[association négaWatt]] provides a theoretical support to the transition movement.&lt;ref name=watt /&gt;

===Economics===
As of 2010, the Transition Network (TN) includes the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 global financial crisis]] as further threat to local communities, alongside peak oil and climate change. To counter economic instability, the TN promotes [[fiscal localism]].&lt;ref name="LocalFood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LocalMoney" /&gt; To help further these aims TN setup up the REconomy Project circa 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reconomy.org/finally-its-here-the-reconomy-website-goes-live/|title=Finally! It’s here! The REconomy website goes live! - REconomy|author=|date=29 May 2012|website=reconomy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods===
While the focus and aims remain the same, the methods used to achieve these vary. For example, Totnes has introduced its own [[local currency]], the [[Totnes pound]], which is redeemable in local shops and businesses, helping to reduce "food miles" while also supporting local firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/devon/6692755.stm |title=Town poised for its own currency |author=Morris, Jonathan |date=4 June 2007 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is also planned{{who|date=May 2014}} to be introduced in three [[Wales|Welsh]] transition towns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_west/7326212.stm |title=Towns banking their own currency |date=2 April 2008 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Maleny]] [[Australia]], the Baroon Dollar as a part of a regional transition towns project.&lt;ref name="ABC_AU_1709534"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-06-10/money-worries-town-prints-its-own/1709534 |title=Money worries: town prints its own |date=10 June 2009 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Transition towns have been featured in the plot line of the long-running [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''[[The Archers]]''. This is an example of mainstream media attention the movement received a few years after being founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/backstage/transition.shtml |title=BBC - Radio 4 - Archers - The Archers - Transition Ambridge |date=30 December 2008 |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230203017/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/backstage/transition.shtml |archivedate=December 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

===Books===
A number of books have been published on specific topics, including: how communities can develop their Transition town initiative. Unless stated, the following books were published as a collaboration between Green Books and the Transition Network (under the label ''Transition Books''):&lt;ref name=books /&gt;

[[File:Venn 0111 1111.svg|thumb|200px|Union of three sets:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;~A \cup B \cup C&lt;/math&gt;]]
[[File:Example of a non pairwise disjoint family of sets.svg|200px|thumb|The union of A, B, C, D, and E is everything except the white area.]]
In [[set theory]], the '''union''' (denoted by ∪) of a collection of sets is the set of all [[element (set theory)|element]]s in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Union.html|title=Union|author=Weisstein, Eric W|publisher=Wolfram's Mathworld|accessdate=2009-07-14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207202412/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Union.html|archivedate=2009-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the fundamental operations through which sets can be combined and related to each other.

For explanation of the symbols used in this article, refer to the [[List of mathematical symbols|table of mathematical symbols]].

== Union of two sets ==
The union of two sets ''A'' and ''B'' is the set of elements which are in ''A'', in ''B'', or in both ''A'' and ''B''.  In symbols,

:&lt;math&gt;A  \cup B = \{ x: x \in A \text{  or  } x \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LBvpfEMhurwC|title=Basic Set Theory|last=Vereshchagin|first=Nikolai Konstantinovich|last2=Shen|first2=Alexander|date=2002-01-01|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=9780821827314|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if ''A'' = {1, 3, 5, 7} and ''B'' = {1, 2, 4, 6} then ''A'' ∪ ''B'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.  A more elaborate example (involving two infinite sets) is:
: ''A'' = {''x'' is an even [[integer]] larger than 1}
: ''B'' = {''x'' is an odd integer larger than 1}
: &lt;math&gt;A \cup B = \{2,3,4,5,6, \dots\}&lt;/math&gt;

As another example, the number 9 is ''not'' contained in the union of the set of [[prime number]]s {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, …} and the set of [[even number]]s {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, …}, because 9 is neither prime nor even.

Sets cannot have duplicate elements,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hM3-xxZC-8C&amp;pg=PA24|title=Applied Mathematics for Database Professionals|last=deHaan|first=Lex|last2=Koppelaars|first2=Toon|date=2007-10-25|publisher=Apress|isbn=9781430203483|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the union of the sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is {1, 2, 3, 4}. Multiple occurrences of identical elements have no effect on the [[cardinality]] of a set or its contents.

== Algebraic properties ==
Binary union is an [[associative]] operation; that is, for any sets ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'',

:&lt;math&gt;A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C.&lt;/math&gt;

The operations can be performed in any order, and the parentheses may be omitted without ambiguity (i.e., either of the above can be expressed equivalently as ''A'' ∪ ''B'' ∪ ''C''). Similarly, union is [[commutative]], so the sets can be written in any order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jV_aBwAAQBAJ|title=Naive Set Theory|last=Halmos|first=P. R.|date=2013-11-27|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781475716450|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[empty set]] is an [[identity element]] for the operation of union. That is, ''A'' ∪ ∅ = ''A'', for any set ''A.'' This follows from analogous facts about [[logical disjunction]].

Since sets with unions and intersections form a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] distributes over union
:&lt;math&gt;A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B)\cup(A \cap C)&lt;/math&gt; 
and union distributes over intersection
:&lt;math&gt;A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)&lt;/math&gt; .

Within a given [[universe (mathematics)|universal set]], union can be written in terms of the operations of intersection and [[complement (set theory)|complement]] as
:&lt;math&gt;A \cup B = \left(A^C \cap B^C \right)^C&lt;/math&gt;
where the superscript &lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the complement with respect to the universal set.

== Finite unions ==
One can take the union of several sets simultaneously.  For example, the union of three sets ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' contains all elements of ''A'', all elements of ''B'', and all elements of ''C'', and nothing else. Thus, ''x'' is an element of ''A'' ∪ ''B'' ∪ ''C'' if and only if ''x'' is in at least one of ''A'', ''B'', and ''C''.

In mathematics a '''finite union''' means any union carried out on a finite number of sets; it does not imply that the union set is a [[finite set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u06-BAAAQBAJ|title=Set Theory: With an Introduction to Real Point Sets|last=Dasgupta|first=Abhijit|date=2013-12-11|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781461488545|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Finite_Union_of_Finite_Sets_is_Finite|title=Finite Union of Finite Sets is Finite - ProofWiki|author=|date=|website=proofwiki.org|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911224545/https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Finite_Union_of_Finite_Sets_is_Finite|archivedate=11 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arbitrary unions ==

The most general notion is the union of an arbitrary collection of sets, sometimes called an ''infinitary union''. If '''M''' is a set or [[Class (set theory)|class]] whose elements are sets, then ''x'' is an element of the union of '''M''' [[if and only if]] there is [[existential quantification|at least one]] element ''A'' of '''M''' such that ''x'' is an element of ''A''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOUbCgAAQBAJ|title=A Transition to Advanced Mathematics|last=Smith|first=Douglas|last2=Eggen|first2=Maurice|last3=Andre|first3=Richard St|date=2014-08-01|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781285463261|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In symbols:
: &lt;math&gt;x \in \bigcup \mathbf{M} \iff \exists A \in \mathbf{M},\ x \in A.&lt;/math&gt;
This idea subsumes the preceding sections—for example, ''A'' ∪ ''B'' ∪ ''C'' is the union of the collection {''A'', ''B'', ''C''}. Also, if '''M''' is the empty collection, then the union of '''M''' is the empty set.

=== Notations ===
The notation for the general concept can vary considerably.  For a finite union of sets &lt;math&gt;S_1, S_2, S_3, \dots , S_n&lt;/math&gt; one often writes &lt;math&gt;S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3 \cup \dots \cup S_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i=1}^n S_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Various common notations for arbitrary unions include  &lt;math&gt;\bigcup \mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{A\in\mathbf{M}} A&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I} A_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, the last of which refers to the union of the collection &lt;math&gt;\left\{A_i : i \in I\right\}&lt;/math&gt; where ''I'' is an [[index set]] and &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; is a set for every &lt;math&gt;i \in I&lt;/math&gt;. In the case that the index set ''I'' is the set of [[natural number]]s, one uses a notation &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_{i}&lt;/math&gt; analogous to that of the [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When the symbol "∪" is placed before other symbols instead of between them, it is usually rendered as a larger size.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33862">'''Wrecking''' is the practice of taking valuables from a [[shipwreck]] which has foundered or run aground close to shore. Often an unregulated activity of opportunity in coastal communities, wrecking has been subjected to increasing regulation and evolved into what is now known as [[marine salvage]]. Wrecking is no longer economically significant; however, as recently as the 19th century in some parts of the world, it was the mainstay of otherwise economically marginal coastal communities.

A traditional legend is of wreckers deliberately decoying ships on to coasts using tricks (in particular false lights), so that they run ashore and can be plundered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutchings|first1=Richard J|title=Smugglers of the Isle of Wight|date=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this has been depicted in many stories and legends, it is uncertain that this has ever happened.

=="False lights"==
There are legends that some ships were deliberately lured into danger by a display of false lights. John Viele, retired U. S. Navy officer and author of a history of wrecking in the Florida Keys, states that such tricks simply would not work. He points out that mariners interpret a light as indicating land, and so avoid them if they cannot identify them. Moreover, oil lanterns cannot be seen very far over water at night, unless they are large, fitted with mirrors or lenses, and mounted at a great height (i.e., in a [[lighthouse]]). In hundreds of admiralty court cases heard in [[Key West, Florida]], no captain of a wrecked ship ever charged that he had been led astray by a false light.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 94-5.&lt;/ref&gt; A Bahamian wrecker, when asked if he and his crewmates made beacons on shore or showed their lights to warn ships away from the land at night, is reported to have said, "No, no [laughing]; we always put them out for a better chance by night".&lt;ref&gt;Albury. P. 139.&lt;br&gt;Craton. P. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legend maintains that the town of [[Nags Head, North Carolina]] takes its name from wreckers or "Bankers" deploying false lights. The Nags Head urban legend states that in the 18th century, wreckers would hang lanterns from the necks of [[mule]]s (colloquially called "nags" at the time) and walk the animals very slowly up and down the beach. The alleged intent was to fool mariners into believing that the slow-moving lights were ships drifting at rest or at anchor, prompting the ships to change course and subsequently run aground.  In 1860, a writer for ''Harper’s New Monthly Magazine'' corroborates the story of the "Bankers" who gave Nags Head its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walbert|first1=David|title=Graveyard of the Atlantic|url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-colonial/2704|website=Learn NC|publisher=learnnc.org|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wrecking in the Americas==

===Spanish America===
As soon as the Spanish began sending home the treasures they found in the New World, some of the treasure was lost in shipwrecks. By the 1540s Indians along the coast of Florida, where many of the Spanish treasure ships wrecked, were diving on the wrecks and recovering significant amounts of gold and silver. By that time the Spanish had been using first Indians (the [[Lucayan people|Lucayans]] from [[the Bahamas]] were particularly prized for the task) and then Africans to dive for pearls around the islands near present-day [[Venezuela]]. The Spanish began using these divers to recover treasure from shipwrecks. The Spanish kept salvage ships with crews of African divers on-call in major ports around the Caribbean, ready to sail as soon as word of a wreck was received. In the course of the 16th through the 18th centuries the Spanish recovered more than 100,000,000 [[peso]]s worth of treasure by such means. Spanish salvage efforts had varying success. Although the Spanish carried out salvage operations on the wrecks of the [[1715 Treasure Fleet]] for four years, they recovered less than half of the treasure recorded as sent on the fleet. On the other hand, the Spanish recovered more treasure from the [[List of the 1733 Spanish Plate Fleet Shipwrecks|1733 treasure fleet]] than had been officially registered on it.&lt;ref&gt;Marx. Pp. 55-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bermuda and Jamaica===
In the 16th and 17th centuries Spanish ships returning to Spain from the Caribbean rode the [[Gulf Stream]] to [[Cape Canaveral]] and then aimed for [[Bermuda]]. Raising Bermuda was essential to Spanish ships for verifying their position before setting course for the [[Azores]]. As a result, some Spanish ships wrecked on Bermuda. After the English settled on Bermuda in the early 17th century, they quickly took up "wracking" on Bermuda, and then extended their search for wrecks to all of the Caribbean. Later in the 17th century the center for English "wracking" in the Caribbean shifted to [[Port Royal]] in [[Jamaica]]. [[William Phips]] went there to recruit the divers he used to salvage treasure from a Spanish wreck on the north shore of [[Hispaniola]], where he recovered the largest amount of treasure from a single wreck before the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Marx. P. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===The Bahamas===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Bahamas]]. --&gt;
Wrecking (or "wracking") was an important activity in the Bahamas from its first settlement in 1648. A company of religious dissidents from [[Bermuda]], the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]], established a colony on [[Eleuthera|Eleutheria]]. Their governing document, the ''Articles and Orders'', included regulations of wrecking, providing that any salvaged [[weapon|ordnance]] would be held in common for the defense of the colony, and all other salvaged goods would be delivered to designated agents, "made fit for sale" and then sold, with one-third of the proceeds going to the wreckers.&lt;ref&gt;Albury. Pp 131-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Eleutheran Adventurers were primarily farmers, seamen from Bermuda began settling on [[New Providence]] in the 1660s, attracted by [[ambergris]], [[Shipwreck|wrecks]] and salt. There were vessels dedicated to wrecking from this time, but wrecking was a secondary occupation for most men. These seamen, who called themselves "wrackers" or "wreckers", pursued wrecking aggressively, regarding all salvage as their property. They were rumored to have killed people who had inconveniently survived a shipwreck. They drove [[Spain|Spanish]] salvors away from Spanish wrecks, and even took goods that the Spanish had already salvaged. Spain regarded the Bahamian wreckers as [[pirate]]s, and retaliated by attacking the wreckers' ships, kidnapping farmers from New Providence, and burning the capital, [[Nassau, Bahamas#History|Charles Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Albury. Pp. 48, 51-2, 131, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahamian government eventually exerted control over the wreckers. The wreckers were required to carry salvaged goods to Nassau, where they were auctioned. However, goods useful on a ship or in a wrecker's home were often diverted with a blind eye turned by government officials. Increased shipping after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 led to more wrecks. Vessels specifically designed for wrecking were built in the Bahamas. A [[United States|U.S]] law of 1825 required that all goods salvaged from wrecks in U.S. waters be taken to an American [[port of entry]] (which, for the Bahamians, meant [[Key West, Florida]]). Many Bahamian wreckers eventually moved to Key West and became U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Albury. Pp. 134-5, 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wrecking was a mainstay of the Bahamian economy through most of the 19th century. In 1856 there were 302 ships and 2,679 men (out of a total population of 27,000) licensed as wreckers in the Bahamas. In that year salvaged wreck cargo brought to Nassau was valued at £96,304, more than half of all imports to the Bahamas. More than two-thirds of exports from the Bahamas were salvaged goods. The government normally took 15% customs duty on salvaged goods. If the salvaged cargo was not claimed, the Vice Admiralty Court took 30%, and the Governor took another 10%. Shore workers (warehouse workers, agents and laborers) usually received around 14% of the value. The wreckers themselves usually received 40% to 60% of the value of the salvaged goods. Even so, the average annual income of an ordinary seaman on a wrecker was about ₤20.&lt;ref&gt;Albury. Pp. 135, 137.&lt;br /&gt;Craton. P. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil War]] sharply cut the volume of shipping around the Bahamas, and the wreckers suffered with far fewer wrecks to salvage. The end of the Civil War brought back increased shipping and wrecks. In 1865, the last year of the Civil War, £28,000 worth of salvaged goods were taken to Nassau. In 1866 that rose to £108,000, and peaked at £154,000 in 1870. Wrecking then entered a decline, and was nearly gone by the end of the 19th century. More lighthouses (eventually numbering 37 in the Bahamas), better charts, more ships powered by steam, better qualified ship's officers, and more seaworthy ships all contributed to fewer wrecks.&lt;ref&gt;Albury. Pp. 143, 157.&lt;br /&gt;Craton. Pp. 226-7, 246-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Florida Keys===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Florida Keys]] and [[Key West, Florida]]. --&gt;
For several centuries wrecking was an important economic activity in the [[Florida Keys]]. During the 19th century wrecking in the Keys became a highly organized and regulated industry, with dozens of vessels and hundreds of men active in the trade at any given time. The Florida Keys form a long arc of islands extending from the southern end of the east coast of [[Florida]] to the [[Dry Tortugas]]. A line of shallow coral reefs, the [[Florida Reef]], runs parallel to the Keys from east of [[Key Biscayne|Cape Florida]] to southwest of Key West, with dangerous shoals stretching west from Key West to the Dry Tortugas. This chain of reefs and shoals is approximately {{convert|200|mi|km}} long, separated from the Keys by the narrow and relatively shallow Hawk Channel. The [[Gulf Stream]] passes close to the Florida Reef through the [[Straits of Florida]], which is the major route for shipping between the eastern coast of the [[United States]] and ports in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the western [[Caribbean Sea]]. The combination of heavy shipping and a powerful current flowing close to dangerous reefs made the Florida Keys the site of a great many wrecks, especially during the 19th century. Ships were wrecking on the Florida Reef at the rate of almost once a week in the middle of the 19th century (the collector of customs in Key West reported a rate of 48 wrecks a year in 1848). For a period of almost 100 years, wrecking captains and wrecking vessels in the Keys had to hold a license issued by the [[United States district court|Federal court]]. In 1858 there were 47 boats and ships licensed as wreckers.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 54-5, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early history====
Ships began wrecking along the Florida Reef almost as soon as Europeans reached the [[New World]]. From early in the 16th century, Spanish ships returning from the New World to Spain sailed from [[Havana]] to catch the Gulf Stream, which meant they passed close to the Florida Reef, with some wrecking. The first wreckers in the Keys were Indians; when [[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]]'s ship was wrecked in 1549, he was taken prisoner by Indians who were experienced in plundering wrecked ships. In 1622, six ships of the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] wrecked during a [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]] in the lower Keys. Spanish operations to recover the gold and silver from the lost ships continued intermittently for 21 years, but the Spanish lost track of the ''[[Nuestra Señora de Atocha]]'', which was finally found and excavated in the 20th century. In 1733, 19 ships of the Spanish treasure fleet wrecked during a hurricane in the middle and upper keys, and salvage operations lasted four years. The Spanish used dragged chains, [[grapnel]]s, [[Free-diving|free divers]] and even an early [[diving bell]] to find and recover goods from the wrecked ships.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 3-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 18th century ships from [[The Bahamas]] began frequenting the Florida Keys. The Bahamians were opportunists, [[fishing]], [[Turtling (hunting)|turtling]], [[logging]] tropical [[hardwood]]s on the Keys, and salvaging wrecks as the opportunity arose. When the Spanish were salvaging the wrecks of the 1733 treasure fleet, the Spanish commander of the operation expressed concern that the Bahamians would try to salvage some of the treasure on their own. By 1775, George Gauld, who produced a chart of the Keys that was still being used 75 years later, advised mariners to stay with their ships if they wrecked, so that the Bahamian wreckers could assist them. Although the Keys were at various times part of [[Spanish Florida]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] colony of [[East Florida]] and the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Florida Territory]], the Bahamians took goods salvaged from ships wrecked in the Keys to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] for adjudication, rather than to the Florida [[port of entry]], [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. After the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[War of 1812]] in 1815, increased shipping through the Straights of Florida resulted in an increase in wrecks on the Keys, and [[the Crown]]'s share from the auction of salvaged goods became the major support of the economy of Nassau.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 14-25, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Under United States jurisdiction====
After 1815, fishing boats from [[New England]] began visiting the Florida Keys in the winter to fish for the Havana market. These fishermen engaged in wrecking when the opportunity arose. With the acquisition of Florida by the United States in 1821 and the settlement of Key West in 1822, the New England fishermen-wreckers began moving their homes to Key West. Conflicts quickly developed with the Bahamian wreckers. [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] ships stopped and boarded Bahamian wreckers to check papers, and arrested two Bahamian captains on suspicion of smuggling slaves. American wreckers became increasingly hostile to Bahamian wreckers, and in 1825 the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed a law requiring all goods salvaged in U.S. waters to be taken to an American port of entry. This measure created a great inconvenience for the Bahamian wreckers, as they had to take salvaged goods and ships to Key West before they could return home to the Bahamas. Some of them soon moved to Key West and acquired U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 25-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Key West had become a port of entry in 1822. In the same year the U.S. Navy chose Key West as its base for suppressing [[piracy]] in the [[West Indies]]. The city quickly developed into Florida's most important port. By the 1830s Key West accounted for 60% to 90% of imports and exports for the Territory. Most of this traffic was due to the activities of the wreckers. [[Warehouse]]s for storing salvaged goods, [[shipyard]]s for repairing damaged ships that had been removed from the reefs and for building vessels to be used in wrecking, and [[ship chandler]]s for refitting ships all contributed to the city's prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 33-7, 64-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1820s and 1830s [[Indian Key, Florida|Indian Key]] functioned as a secondary center for the wrecking industry in the Keys. Closer to most of the reefs off the keys than Key West, Indian Key enjoyed a brief prosperity before being destroyed in a [[Second Seminole War#Indian Key|raid]] by [[Seminoles]] in 1840.

====Wrecking operations====
Wrecking in the Florida Keys was conducted from sailing vessels. Numerous vessels would patrol along the Florida Reef looking for wrecks. The wreckers would normally anchor at night in protected anchorages along the Keys, and then sail out in the morning to see if any ships had wrecked during the night. As a result, a ship that ran on the reef during the night might attract a dozen wreckers by the afternoon of the next day. The first wrecking captain to reach a stranded ship became the wreck master, determining how many wreckers he needed to help salvage the ship, and directing the operation. Wreckers had an obligation to save passengers and crew of the wrecked ship (for which they received no compensation), and to salvage as much of the cargo as possible, and the ship, as well. If the judge in Federal court decided that a wrecking crew had not done everything possible to salvage cargo and ship, he would reduce the award.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 95-7, 133-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The salvaged cargo and the ship, if it could be saved, were taken to Key West where they were appraised or auctioned. The wrecking vessels and crews that participated in the operations would then be awarded a share of the salvage value. Half of the salvage award went to the owners of the wrecking vessels, divided among the boats on a tonnage basis. The other half went to the wrecker crews, proportional to the number of crewmen on each vessel. Ordinary crewmen received one share, "boys" a half-share, cooks, one-and-a-quarter shares, and captains one to three shares, depending on the size of the vessel. Divers, who dove into the flooded holds of ships to retrieve cargo, received extra shares. By the time a salvage award was divided this way, individual shares were often quite small. Contemporary observers estimated that wrecking crews on average made no more than an ordinary seaman.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 73, 76-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first few years after Florida was acquired by the United States, salvage awards were determined either by prior agreement between the wreck master and the captain of the wrecked ship, or by arbitration. As the persons available to serve as arbitrators usually had ties to the wrecking industry, if not a direct business relationship with the wreck master and/or the owners of the wrecking vessels, the process was often abused, with awards as high as 90% of the salvaged value. In 1829 a United States District Court was established in Key West with admiralty jurisdiction, after which most salvage cases were decided in court. Court awards for a wrecking operation averaged about 25% of the salvage value. Private agreements and arbitration remained an option, however, particularly when the judge was not available.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 43-48.&lt;/ref&gt; A visitor to Key West in the 1880s reported that the United States District Court was in session almost every week, and had heard more than 700 [[Admiralty law]] cases during the preceding year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sunshine|first=Sylvia|title=Petals Plucked from Sunny Climes|year=1886|publisher=Southern Methodist Publishing House|location=Nashville, Tennessee|pages=319|url=https://archive.org/details/petalspluckedfro00brooiala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wreckers were required by the Federal law to carry equipment that might be needed to save cargo and ships. Such equipment included heavy anchors for kedging (hauling) ships off reefs, heavy [[hawser]]s and chain, [[fender (boating)|fenders]] and [[Block and tackle|blocks and tackle]]. Wreckers also had to be prepared to make emergency repairs to ships to refloat them or keep them afloat while they were sailed or towed back to Key West. By the middle of the 19th century [[windmill]]-powered pumps, and later a steam-powered pump, were kept in Key West. If the wreckers were not able to pump out a ship fast enough to float it using the ship's own pumps, they could rent one of the large pumps from Key West. As the wrecking vessels could not always directly approach wrecked ships, they had to carry sturdy boats.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 46, 61-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cargoes saved by wreckers varied tremendously. Cotton was perhaps the most valuable bulk cargo. A bale of cotton might be worth [[United States dollar|US$]]50 or $60 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], but a bale pulled from a flooded hold would be saturated with water, and weigh as much as half a [[ton]]. Unusual cargoes salvaged by wreckers included the fossilized [[Basilosaurus#Fossil finds|"Hydrarchos"]] skeleton collected in [[Alabama]] by Albert Koch, and a [[locomotive]]. In 1827 [[Guerrero (ship)|''Guerrero'']], a Spanish slave-runner carrying 500 African captives, and the [[Royal Navy]] warship [[HMS Nimble (1826)|HMS ''Nimble'']] ran onto the Florida Reef during a running gun battle. Wreckers went to the aid of both ships. After most of the Africans and the Spanish crewmen had been transferred to wrecker vessels, the Spanish crewmen commandeered two of the ships and sailed to Cuba with most of the Africans. The remaining 120 Africans were taken to Key West, and then to St. Augustine. After Congress passed a special law the next year, 96 surviving Africans were sent to [[Liberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 122-31, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decline====
In an effort to reduce the number of wrecks along the Florida Reef, the United States government funded the construction of lighthouses. Lighthouses were built in the 1820s at [[Cape Florida Light|Cape Florida]], Key West (both on the [[Key West Light|island]] itself and on nearby [[Sand Key Light|Sand Key]], and on [[Garden Key Light|Garden Key]] in the Dry Tortugas. A lightship was stationed at [[Carysfort Reef Light|Carysfort Reef]]. Mariners complained that the lights were not visible enough. There were also long interruptions. The Cape Florida lighthouse was burned by Seminoles in 1836 and remained dark for ten years. It was also dark while the tower was made higher in 1855. It was put out of commission again in 1860 by [[Confederate States of American|Confederate]] sympathizers and remained dark until the end of the [[American Civil War]] in 1865. The Key West and Sand Key lighthouses were destroyed by a hurricane in 1846. A lightship was placed at Sand Key until the lighthouses could be rebuilt. Beginning in 1852 lighthouses were built directly on the Florida Reef, but it was 1880 before mariners could rely on having a lighthouse in sight at all times while sailing along the Florida Reef.&lt;ref&gt;Viele.

The wreckers were unhappy about the lights, expecting them to reduce the number of wrecks and their livelihood. Initially, however, the lights did not greatly reduce the number of wrecks. Some ships wrecked when their captains became confused about which lights they were seeing, mistaking lights on the Florida Reef for lights on the [[Bahama Banks]]. Some wrecks may have been deliberate, as well. On a few occasions wreckers trying to refloat flooded ships discovered that holes had been bored through the hull below the water line. The captain of a ship that had wrecked stated that the wreck was not to be greatly regretted, as there were too many ships in the freight business. Judge Marvin of the Federal court in Key West told a navy officer in 1860 there was "a great deal of wrecking by design."&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 140, 154-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipping through the Straits of Florida, and therefore the number of wrecks on the Florida Reef, declined sharply during the Civil War. Following the Civil War, the number of wrecks did not increase as fast as the ship traffic through the Straits. More lighthouses were in place, better charts were available, and more ships were powered by steam and thus less vulnerable to being pushed onto reefs by unfavorable winds. Steam-powered vessels began to enter the wrecking trade. Eventually ocean-going [[tugboat]]s took over what became known as [[marine salvage]] operations. By the end of the 19th century wrecks were infrequent. The last major wrecking operation was in 1905, when 77 small vessels and 500 men salvaged cargo from the steamer ''Alicia''. Salvage work was abandoned when divers refused to continue, as contaminated water in the hold was causing them to become blind for 24 hours after a dive. The salvage award was US$17,690. The last local wrecker was bought out by a New York company in 1920. The Federal court closed the book of wrecking licenses the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 169-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of the isolated communities along the outer banks of North Carolina and the Islands of [[Hatteras Island|Hatteras]], [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke]], and [[Portsmouth, North Carolina|Portsmouth]] and in Newfoundland and the islands and coastline of the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and engaged in wrecking for many years. In [[Nova Scotia]], [[Seal Island, Nova Scotia|Seal Island]] and especially [[Sable Island]] were known for wrecking. Reports of violent wreckers on Sable helped spur efforts by the colony of Nova Scotia to establish a rescue station in Sable Island in 1801.

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
Wrecking was well known in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] where the rocky coastline, and strong prevailing onshore winds helped wreck many merchant ships and warships. It is rumoured that ships were sometimes deliberately attracted: false lights on the shore were said to be used sometimes to lead ships into disaster. However, there is no evidence to support these ideas.

In 1735 a law was passed to make it an offence to make false lights, but no one was prosecuted as a result. In 1769 William Pearse was hanged at [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]] in Cornwall for stealing from a wreck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/cornwall.html Death sentences - Cornwall 1735-1799]&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until after a case in the Court of Appeal in 1870 that rewards were made for rescuing people.

Wrecking was a major industry in the 19th century, and as far back as the 16th century, especially of ships returning from the New World using the [[Gulf Stream]], which passes by the south west of England. This would help to speed these ships on their way to France and Spain and put them out of position. Wreckers would attempt to frighten off the curious, suspicious or unwanted visitors, by spreading wild rumours concerning supernatural activity, ghosts and cannibals (as occurred in [[Clovelly]]) near their wrecking sites.

Wrecking was a major activity of the inhabitants of [[Stroma Island]] in the [[Pentland Firth]] off the north of [[Scotland]]. It was also well known on the [[Goodwin Sands]] off the south east of England where over 2000 wrecks have occurred. The boatmen of [[Deal, Kent|Deal]], who took supplies to ships at anchor off the coast, would plunder any wrecked vessel. Another area where wrecking was prevalent was the Wirral Peninsula, near Liverpool, where wrecking continued to be reported into the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wirralhistory.net/smugglers.html ''Wirral Smugglers, Wreckers and Pirates'' by Gavin Chappell&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 BBC documentary, [[Coast (TV series)|''Coast'']], successfully replicated the conditions of false light wrecking in an experiment which suggested that a single-candle lantern onshore would be sufficient to lure a boat into dangerous water on a dark night. It should be noted that the boat crew did not see the light until they got within 150m of it.&lt;ref&gt;''Coast'' Series 1 episode 2, BBC 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the container ship [[MSC Napoli|MSC ''Napoli'']] went aground off [[Branscombe]] beach in [[Devon]]. Some of its cargo was washed ashore and many wreckers plundered the cargo in spite of attempts to prevent this. People came long distances to retrieve such things as BMW motorcycles. Goods from wrecks are supposed by law to be reported to the "[[Receiver of Wreck]]" and finders will then be given a reward.

=== Denmark ===
Wrecking has been practised a long way back in Denmark. The long shorelines, the heavy international marine traffic in combination with some difficult and often harsh waters, has produced many wrecks here. It was only recently, that the light signalling was fully developed and deep sea-bed canals were dug in the often very shallow waters here, making seafaring relatively safe. [[Skagen's Vippefyr]] was constructed in 1627, along with several other rudimentary lighting signals in the following years, after complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfs.dk/da/soeg-i-soefartshistorien/digitale-udstillinger/navigation-og-verdensbilleder/hjaelpen-fra-kysten/skagens-vippefyr|title=Skagens vippefyr|language=Danish|publisher=Maritime Museum of Denmark|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea floor canals came centuries later. It was and still is common practice to hire skilled Danish pilots to help navigate in and out of the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfs.dk/da/soeg-i-soefartshistorien/digitale-udstillinger/navigation-og-verdensbilleder/hjaelpen-fra-kysten/ove-alexis-winsloev|title=Ove Alexis Winsløv|language=Danish|publisher=Maritime Museum of Denmark|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So-called wreck masters used to be employed in the Danish coastal communities, in order to oversee, report on and collect valuables from new wrecks. A former wreck masters home can be experienced at the Wreck Master's Farm near [[Rubjerg Knude]] on the North Atlantic coast for example. The last wreck master here left in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rubjergknude.dk/index.php?id=175|title=The Wreck Master's Farm|publisher=Vendsyssel Historical Museum|website=Rubjerg Knude's cultural and natural history|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few wreck masters are still appointed in Denmark, but nowadays the job also includes observations and reporting on oil spills, pollutions, vandalism, etc., and they work in close cooperation with the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strandfoged.dk/om-strandfogeden|title=Strandfoged |language=Danish|website=Standfogeden.dk|accessdate=28 September 2014}} Official website for wreck masters in Denmark&lt;/ref&gt;
