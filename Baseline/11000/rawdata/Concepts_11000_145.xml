The '''absent-minded professor''' is a [[stock character]] of popular fiction, usually portrayed as a talented [[academic]] whose academic brilliance is accompanied by below-par functioning in other areas, leading to forgetfulness and mistakes. One explanation of this is that highly talented individuals often have unevenly distributed capabilities, being brilliant in their field of choice but below average on other measures of ability. Alternatively, they are considered to be so engrossed in their field of study that they forget their surroundings. 

The [[phrase]] "absent-minded professor" is also commonly used more generally in [[English language|English]] to describe people who are so engrossed in their "own world" that they fail to keep track of their surroundings. It is a common [[stereotype]] that [[professor]]s get so obsessed with their research that they pay little attention to anything else.

The stereotype is very old: the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] biographer [[Diogenes Laërtius]] wrote that the philosopher [[Thales]] walked at night with his eyes focused on the heavens and, as a result, fell down a [[Water well|well]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ''Lives of the Eminent Philosophers'', "Thales"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of real absent-minded professors==
[[Isaac Newton]],&lt;ref name=name1&gt;[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=2OCKrF6YNKEC&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;dq=feynman%20absent-minded%20scientist&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q=feynman%20absent-minded%20scientist&amp;f=false], p.ix&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Smith]], [[André-Marie Ampère]], [[Jacques Hadamard]], [[Sewall Wright]], [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Archimedes]], [[Pierre Curie]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=s3vieJGqDooC&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=feynman%20absent-minded%20scientist&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q=feynman%20absent-minded%20scientist&amp;f=false], p.76&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Albert Einstein]]&lt;ref name=name1/&gt; were all scholars considered to be absent-minded &amp;ndash; their attention absorbed by their academic studies. [[William Archibald Spooner]], who gave his name to the [[spoonerism]], was known for his [[absent-mindedness]] and eccentricity.

==Fictitious absent-minded professors==
"Doc" [[Emmett Brown]] from ''[[Back to the Future]]'' is an example of an absent-minded professor in film. Another example is the title character in the film ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' and its less successful film remakes, all based on the short story "A Situation of Gravity" by [[Samuel W. Taylor]]. 

Examples in television include [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] in ''[[Futurama]]'', [[Professor Frink]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]'', [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter Bishop]] in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', and Professor Von Schlemmer in ''[[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Multo, one of the characters in the children's series ''[[The Zula Patrol]]'', is another example of an absent-minded professor. 

Professor Kokintz in ''[[The Mouse That Roared]]'' by [[Leonard Wibberley]] is an example from literature. [[Professor Branestawm]], created in the 1930s by [[Norman Hunter (author)|Norman Hunter]], is an earlier example of the archetype, and [[Jacques Paganel]] from the [[Jules Verne]]'s 1867 novel ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]'' is probably the codifier of the archetype in the modern literature. Professor Caractacus Potts in the story of ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (novel)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' qualifies as an absent-minded inventor. 

Comic strip examples include [[Professor Calculus]] in ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''; Eli Eon in ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]''; and Professor Edgewise, a minor recurring character in [[Marvel Family]] stories. 

[[Isaac Kleiner]] from the ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' saga and Professor Harold MacDougal from ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' are examples in videogames.

The archetype is sometimes mixed with that of the [[mad scientist]], often for comic effect, as in the [[Jerry Lewis]] film ''[[The Nutty Professor]]'' or the Profesor Bacterio in the ''[[Mortadelo y Filemón]]'' comics and movies. However, the mad scientist archetype usually has malevolent connotations, while the absent-minded professor is typically characterized as benevolent. 

The fictional absent-minded professor is often a college professor of science or engineering; in the [[fantasy]] genre, a similar character may appear as a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]. Examples of this include the characterisation of [[Merlin]] in ''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' (particularly in [[The Sword in the Stone (film)|the Disney adaptation]]) and [[Albus Dumbledore]] in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series.

[[File:Scout Girl in Concentration.jpg|thumb|Focused attention]]

'''Attention''' is the behavioral and [[cognition|cognitive process]] of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether deemed subjective or objective, while ignoring other perceivable information. It is a state of [[arousal]]. It is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneous objects or trains of thought. [[Focalization]], the concentration of [[consciousness]], is of its essence. Attention has also been described as the [[Attention economy|allocation]] of limited cognitive processing resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=John R. |authorlink=John Robert Anderson (psychologist) |year=2004 |title=Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications |edition=6th |publisher=Worth Publishers |url= https://books.google.com/?id=9P4p6eAULMoC |isbn=978-0-7167-0110-1 |page=519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attention remains a major area of investigation within [[education]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], and [[neuropsychology]]. Areas of active investigation involve determining the source of the sensory cues and signals that generate attention, the effects of these sensory cues and signals on the [[neuronal tuning|tuning]] properties of sensory [[neurons]], and the relationship between attention and other behavioral and cognitive processes like [[working memory]] and [[vigilance (psychology)|psychological vigilance]]. A relatively new body of research, which expands upon earlier research within psychopathology, is investigating the diagnostic symptoms associated with [[traumatic brain injury]] and its effects on attention. Attention also varies across cultures.&lt;ref name="Chavajay 1999 1079–1090"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chavajay|first=P |first2= B |last2= Rogoff|title=Cultural Variation in Management of Attention by Children and Their Caregivers|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1999|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1079–90|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.35.4.1079|pmid=10442876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationships between attention and [[consciousness]] are complex enough that they have warranted perennial philosophical exploration. Such exploration is both ancient and continually relevant, as it can have effects in fields ranging from [[mental health]] and the study of [[disorders of consciousness]] to [[artificial intelligence]] and its domains of research and development.

==Contemporary definition and research==
Prior to the founding of [[psychology]] as a scientific discipline, attention was studied in the field of [[philosophy]]. Thus, many of the discoveries in the field of attention were made by philosophers. Psychologist [[John B. Watson]] calls [[Juan Luis Vives]] the father of modern psychology because, in his book ''De Anima et Vita'' (''The Soul and Life''), he was the first to recognize the importance of empirical investigation.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004 1–24"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Addie|title=Attention: Theory and Practice|year=2004|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|isbn=978-0-7619-2760-0|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his work on memory, Vives found that the more closely one attends to stimuli, the better they will be retained.

By the 1990s, psychologists began using [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and later [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) to image the brain while monitoring tasks involving attention. Because this expensive equipment was generally only available in hospitals, psychologists sought cooperation with neurologists. Psychologist [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Michael Posner]] (then already renowned for his seminal work on visual selective attention) and neurologist [[Marcus Raichle]] pioneered brain imaging studies of selective attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their results soon sparked interest from the neuroscience community, which had until then focused on monkey brains. With the development of these technological innovations, [[neuroscience|neuroscientists]] became interested in this type of research that combines sophisticated experimental paradigms from [[cognitive psychology]] with these new brain imaging techniques. Although the older technique of [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) had long been used to study the brain activity underlying selective attention by [[psychophysiology|cognitive psychophysiologists]], the ability of the newer techniques to actually measure precisely localized activity inside the brain generated renewed interest by a wider community of researchers.

==Selective and visual==
{{See also|Selective auditory attention}}
[[File:Wikipedia-spotlight.jpg|thumb|200px|right|alt=The spotlight model of attention]]
In [[cognitive psychology]] there are at least two models which describe how visual attention operates. These models may be considered loosely as metaphors which are used to describe internal processes and to generate hypotheses that are [[falsifiable]]. Generally speaking, visual attention is thought to operate as a two-stage process.&lt;ref name="Jonides"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jonides | first = J. | year = 1983 | title = Further towards a model of the mind's eye's movement | url =http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jjonides/pdf/1983_4.pdf | journal = Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 247–50 | doi=10.3758/bf03334699}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first stage, attention is distributed uniformly over the external visual scene and processing of information is performed in parallel. In the second stage, attention is concentrated to a specific area of the visual scene (i.e., it is focused), and processing is performed in a serial fashion.

The first of these models to appear in the literature is the spotlight model. The term "spotlight" was inspired by the work of [[William James]], who described attention as having a focus, a margin, and a fringe.&lt;ref name="Eriksen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eriksen | first1 = C | last2 = Hoffman | first2 = J | year = 1972 | title = Temporal and spatial characteristics of selective encoding from visual displays | url =http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;uid=1973-01584-001 | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 12 | issue = 2B| pages = 201–4 | doi = 10.3758/BF03212870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus is an area that extracts information from the visual scene with a high-resolution, the geometric center of which being where visual attention is directed. Surrounding the focus is the fringe of attention, which extracts information in a much more crude fashion (i.e., low-resolution). This fringe extends out to a specified area, and the cut-off is called the margin.

The second model is called the zoom-lens model and was first introduced in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eriksen | first1 = C | last2 = St James | first2 = J | year = 1986 | title = Visual attention within and around the field of focal attention: A zoom lens model |journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 225–40 |pmid=3786090 | doi = 10.3758/BF03211502}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model inherits all properties of the spotlight model (i.e., the focus, the fringe, and the margin), but it has the added property of changing in size. This size-change mechanism was inspired by the [[zoom lens]] one might find on a camera, and any change in size can be described by a trade-off in the efficiency of processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0001-6918(90)90022-8 | last1 = Castiello | first1 = U | last2 = Umilta | first2 = C | year = 1990 | title = Size of the attentional focus and efficiency of processing | journal = Acta Psychologica | volume = 73 | issue = 3| pages = 195–209 | pmid = 2353586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The zoom-lens of attention can be described in terms of an inverse trade-off between the size of focus and the efficiency of processing: because attentional resources are assumed to be fixed, then it follows that the larger the focus is, the slower processing will be of that region of the visual scene, since this fixed resource will be distributed over a larger area. It is thought that the focus of attention can subtend a minimum of 1° of [[visual angle]],&lt;ref name="Eriksen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eriksen | first1 = CW | last2 = Hoffman | first2 = JE | year = 1973 | title = The extent of processing of noise elements during selective encoding from visual displays | url = http://www.psychonomic.org/backissues/21786//pp/vol14-1/pp-14-155.pdf | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 155–160 | doi = 10.3758/BF03198630 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; however the maximum size has not yet been determined.

A significant debate emerged in the last decade of the 20th century in which Treisman's 1993 Feature Integration Theory (FIT) was compared to Duncan and Humphrey's 1989 attentional engagement theory (AET).&lt;ref name=r5&gt;[[#Raftopoulos|Raftopoulos]], pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; FIT posits that "objects are retrieved from scenes by means of selective spatial attention that picks out objects' features, forms feature maps, and integrates those features that are found at the same location into forming objects." Duncan and Humphrey's AET understanding of attention maintained that "there is an initial pre-attentive parallel phase of perceptual segmentation and analysis that encompasses all of the visual items present in a scene. At this phase, descriptions of the objects in a visual scene are generated into structural units; the outcome of this parallel phase is a multiple-spatial-scale structured representation. Selective attention intervenes after this stage to select information that will be entered into visual short-term memory."&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; The contrast of the two theories placed a new emphasis on the separation of visual attention tasks alone and those mediated by supplementary cognitive processes. As Rastophopoulos summarizes the debate: "Against Treisman's FIT, which posits spatial attention as a necessary condition for detection of objects, Humphreys argues that visual elements are encoded and bound together in an initial parallel phase without focal attention, and that attention serves to select among the objects that result from this initial grouping."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Raftopoulos|Raftopoulos]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuropsychological model==
In the twentieth century, the pioneering research of Lev Vygotsky and Alexander Luria led to the three-part model of neuropsychology defining the working brain as being represented by three co-active processes listed as Attention, Memory, and Activation. Attention is identified as one of the three major co-active processes of the working brain. A.R. Luria published his well-known book ''The Working Brain'' in 1973 as a concise adjunct volume to his previous 1962 book ''Higher Cortical Functions in Man''. In this volume, Luria summarized his three-part global theory of the working brain as being composed of three constantly co-active processes which he described as the; (1) Attention system, (2) Mnestic (memory) system, and (3) Cortical activation system. The two books together are considered by Homskaya's account as "among Luria's major works in neuropsychology, most fully reflecting all the aspects (theoretical, clinical, experimental) of this new discipline."&lt;ref&gt;Homskaya, Elena, ''A.R. Luria'', Plenum Press, pp 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The product of the combined research of Vygotsky and Luria have determined a large part of the contemporary understanding and definition of attention as it is understood at the start of the 21st-century.

== Multitasking and divided ==
{{see also|Human multitasking|Distracted driving}}

Multitasking can be defined as the attempt to perform two or more tasks simultaneously; however, research shows that when multitasking, people make more mistakes or perform their tasks more slowly.&lt;ref name=Matlin&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognition|year=2013|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-14896-9|author=Margaret W. Matlin|edition=8|type=Textbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Attention must be divided among all of the component tasks to perform them.  In divided attention, individuals attend or give attention to multiple sources of information at once at the same time or perform more than one task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Attention|last=Gopher|first=D|last2=Iani|first2=C|date=2005|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/wileycs/attention/0|publisher=Encyclopedia of cognitive science|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older research involved looking at the limits of people performing simultaneous tasks like reading stories, while listening and writing something else,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Spelke, Hirst, &amp; Neisser|title=Skills of divided attention|journal=Cognition|year=1976|volume=4|issue=3|pages=215–230|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(76)90018-4|url=https://www.msu.edu/~ema/802/Ch3-4-SpelkeEtAl75.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or listening to two separate messages through different ears (i.e., [[dichotic listening]]).  Generally, classical research into attention investigated the ability of people to learn new information when there were multiple tasks to be performed, or to probe the limits of our perception (c.f. [[Donald Broadbent]]).  There is also older literature on people's performance on multiple tasks performed simultaneously, such as driving a car while tuning a radio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=I. D.|title=Effect of a car radio on driving in traffic|journal=Ergonomics|year=1965|volume=8|issue=4|pages=475–479|doi=10.1080/00140136508930828|pmid=5854152}}&lt;/ref&gt; or driving while telephoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=ID|last2=Tickner |first2= AH |last3= Simmonds |first3= DC |title=Interference between concurrent tasks of driving and telephoning|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=1969|volume=53|issue=5|pages=419–24|doi=10.1037/h0028103|pmid=5366314|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/53/5/419/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of current research on human multitasking is based on performance of doing two tasks simultaneously,&lt;ref name ="Matlin"/&gt; usually that involves driving while performing another task, such as texting, eating, or even speaking to passengers in the vehicle, or with a friend over a cellphone.  This research reveals that the human attentional system has limits for what it can process: driving performance is worse while engaged in other tasks; drivers make more mistakes, brake harder and later, get into more accidents, veer into other lanes, and/or are less aware of their surroundings when engaged in the previously discussed tasks.&lt;ref name="Strahhh &amp; Drews 2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=Attention: From Theory to Practice|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=121–33|last=Strayer |first= D.

There has been little difference found between speaking on a hands-free cell phone or a hand-held cell phone,&lt;ref name="Chabris &amp; Simmons, 2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Invisible Gorilla and Other Ways Our Intuitions Deceive Us|year=2010|publisher=Crown|location=New York|author=Chabris|edition=C.

L.|chapter=Attention: Divided|editor=E. B. Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that it is the strain of attentional system that causes problems, rather than what the driver is doing with his or her hands.  While speaking with a passenger is as cognitively demanding as speaking with a friend over the phone,&lt;ref name="Strayer et al. 2012"&gt;{{cite web |title= Measuring Cognitive Distraction in the Automobile |date= June 2013 |url= https://www.aaafoundation.org/sites/default/files/MeasuringCognitiveDistractions.pdf |publisher= AAA |first1= DL |last1= Strayer |first2= JM |last2= Cooper |first3= J |last3= Turrill |first4= J |last4= Coleman |first5= N |last5= Medeiros-Ward |first6= F |last6= Biond |displayauthors= 4 |type= Research Report |access-date= 2013-11-06 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131028233322/https://www.aaafoundation.org/sites/default/files/MeasuringCognitiveDistractions.pdf |archive-date= 2013-10-28 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; passengers are able to change the conversation based upon the needs of the driver.  For example, if traffic intensifies, a passenger may stop talking to allow the driver to navigate the increasingly difficult roadway; a conversation partner over a phone would not be aware of the change in environment.

There have been multiple theories regarding divided attention. One, conceived by [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]],&lt;ref name="Attention &amp; Effort"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|title=Attention and Effort|year=1973|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/attention_and_effort/Attention_lo_quality.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains that there is a single pool of attentional resources that can be freely divided among multiple tasks. This model seems to be too oversimplified, however, due to the different modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, verbal) that are perceived.&lt;ref name="Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1133313915|author=Sternberg, Robert J.|author2=Sternberg, Karin|type=Textbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the two simultaneous tasks use the same modality, such as listening to a radio station and writing a paper, it is much more difficult to concentrate on both because the tasks are likely to interfere with each other. The specific modality model was theorized by Navon and Gopher in 1979. However, more recent research using well controlled dual-task paradigms points at the importance of tasks.&lt;ref name="Wahn &amp; König 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wahn|first= B |title=Is attentional resource allocation across sensory modalities task-dependent? |journal=Front Psychol | year=2017 | volume=13 |issue= 1 | pages=83–96 | doi=10.5709/acp-0209-2 | pmid=28450975 | last2=König | first2=P | pmc=5405449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in spatial visual-auditory &lt;ref name="Wahn &amp; König 2015a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wahn|first= B |title=Audition and vision share spatial attentional resources, yet attentional load does not disrupt audiovisual integration. |journal=Front Psychol  | year=2015 | volume=6 | pages=1084 | doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01084 | pmid=26284008 | last2=König | first2=P | pmc=4518141}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in spatial visual-tactile tasks &lt;ref name="Wahn &amp; König 2015b"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wahn|first= B |title=Vision and haptics share spatial attentional resources and visuotactile integration is not affected by high attentional load. |journal=Multisens Res  | year=2015 | volume=28 |issue= 3–4 | pages=371–392 | doi=10.1163/22134808-00002482 | pmid=26288905 | last2=König | first2=P }}&lt;/ref&gt; interference of the two tasks is observed. In contrast, when one of the tasks involves object detection, no interference is observed.&lt;ref name="Wahn &amp; König 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wahn|first= B |title=Attentional resource allocation in visuotactile processing depends on the task, but optimal visuotactile integration does not depend on attentional resources. |journal=Front Integr Neurosci   | year=2016 | volume=10 | pages=13 | doi=10.3389/fnint.2016.00013 | pmid=27013994 | last2=König | first2=P | pmc=4781873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the multi-modal advantage in attentional resources is task dependent.

As an alternative, resource theory has been proposed as a more accurate metaphor for explaining divided attention on complex tasks. Resource theory states that as each complex task is automatized, performing that task requires less of the individual's limited-capacity attentional resources.&lt;ref name="Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012"/&gt; Other variables play a part in our ability to pay attention to and concentrate on many tasks at once. These include, but are not limited to, anxiety, arousal, task difficulty, and skills.&lt;ref name="Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012"/&gt;

==Simultaneous==
Simultaneous attention is a type of attention, classified by attending to multiple events at the same time. Simultaneous attention is demonstrated by children in Indigenous communities, who [[Observational Learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|learn]] through this type of attention to their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Correa-Chávez|first1=M|last2=Roberts|first2=ALD |last3= Pérez |first3= MM |title=Cultural patterns in children's learning through keen observation and participation in their communities|pmid=21887963|journal=Advances in Child Development|year=2011|volume=40|pages=209–41|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-386491-8.00006-2|isbn=9780123864918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneous attention is present in the ways in which children of indigenous backgrounds interact both with their surroundings and with other individuals. Simultaneous attention requires focus on multiple simultaneous activities or occurrences. This differs from multitasking, which is characterized by alternating attention and focus between multiple activities, or halting one activity before switching to the next.

Simultaneous attention involves uninterrupted attention to several activities occurring at the same time. Another cultural practice that may relate to simultaneous attention strategies is coordination within a group. Indigenous heritage toddlers and caregivers in San Pedro were observed to frequently coordinate their activities with other members of a group in ways parallel to a model of simultaneous attention, whereas middle-class European-descent families in the U.S. would move back and forth between events.&lt;ref name="Chavajay 1999 1079–1090"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morelli&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morelli|first=G |first2=Angelillo |last2= C |doi=10.1080/01650250244000335|title=Cultural variation in young children's access to work or involvement in specialized child-focused activities|url=http://people.ucsc.edu/~brogoff/Psych247articles/Morelli%20et%20al%20Cultural%20Var%20in%20Young%20Children%27s%20Access.pdf|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|year=2003|volume=27|issue=3|pages=264–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research concludes that children with close ties to Indigenous American roots have a high tendency to be especially wide, keen observers.&lt;ref name="Silva 2010 898–912"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silva|first=KG |last2= Correa-Chavez |first2= M |last3=Rogoff |first3= B |title=Mexican-heritage children's attention and  learning from interactions directed to others|journal=Child Development|year=2010|volume=81|issue=3|pages=898–912|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01441.x|pmid=20573112}}&lt;/ref&gt; This points to a strong cultural difference in attention management.

==Alternative topics and discussions==

===Overt and covert orienting===
Attention may be differentiated into "overt" versus "covert" orienting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Wright |first1= R.D. |last2= Ward |first2= L.M. |year= 2008 |title= Orienting of Attention |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Overt orienting'' is the act of selectively attending to an item or location over others by moving the eyes to point in that direction.&lt;ref name="Posner, M. I. 1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Posner |first= MI |year=1980|title= Orienting of attention|journal= Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume= 32|issue=1|pages= 3–25|pmid=7367577|url=http://psych.unl.edu/mdodd/Psy498/Posner.pdf|doi=10.1080/00335558008248231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overt orienting can be directly observed in the form of eye movements. Although overt eye movements are quite common, there is a distinction that can be made between two types of eye movements; reflexive and controlled. Reflexive movements are commanded by the [[superior colliculus]] of the [[midbrain]]. These movements are fast and are activated by the sudden appearance of stimuli. In contrast, controlled eye movements are commanded by areas in the [[frontal lobe]]. These movements are slow and voluntary.

''Covert orienting'' is the act to mentally shifting one's focus without moving one's eyes.&lt;ref name="Eriksen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Posner, M. I. 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3758/BF03207451|title=Selective attention and serial processing in briefly presented visual displays|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|volume=10|issue=5|pages=321–326|year=1971|last1=Eriksen|first1= CW |last2= Colegate |first2= RL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply, it is changes in attention that are not attributable to overt eye movements. Covert orienting has the potential to affect the output of perceptual processes by governing attention to particular items or locations (for example, the activity of a V4 neuron whose receptive field lies on an attended stimuli will be enhanced by covert attention)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gregoriou |first1= GG |title= High-frequency, long-range coupling between prefrontal and visual cortex during attention |journal= Science |volume= 324 |issue= 5931 |year= 2009 |pages= 1207–10 |pmid= 19478185|doi= 10.1126/science.1171402 |bibcode=2009Sci...324.1207G |pmc=2849291}}&lt;/ref&gt; but does not influence the information that is processed by the senses. Researchers often use "filtering" tasks to study the role of covert attention of selecting information. These tasks often require participants to observe a number of stimuli, but attend to only one.&lt;br /&gt; The current view is that visual covert attention is a mechanism for quickly scanning the field of view for interesting locations. This shift in covert attention is linked to eye movement circuitry that sets up a slower [[saccade]] to that location.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

There are studies that suggest the mechanisms of overt and covert orienting may not be controlled separately and independently as previously believed. Central mechanisms that may control covert orienting, such as the parietal lobe, also receive input from subcortical centres involved in overt orienting.&lt;ref name="Posner, M. I. 1980"/&gt; In support of this, general theories of attention actively assume bottom-up (reflexive) processes and top-down (voluntary) processes converge on a common neural architecture, in that they control both covert and overt attentional systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hunt | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Kingstone | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2003.08.006 | title = Covert and overt voluntary attention: Linked or independent? | journal = Cognitive Brain Research | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 102–105 | year = 2003 | pmid =  14659502| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if individuals attend to the right hand corner field of view, movement of the eyes in that direction may have to be actively suppressed.

===Exogenous and endogenous orienting===
Orienting attention is vital and can be controlled through external (exogenous) or internal (endogenous) processes.  However, comparing these two processes is challenging because external signals do not operate completely exogenously, but will only summon attention and eye movements if they are important to the subject.&lt;ref name="Posner, M. I. 1980"/&gt;

''Exogenous'' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''exo'', meaning "outside", and ''genein'', meaning "to produce") orienting is frequently described as being under control of a stimulus.&lt;ref name="Mayer, A. R. 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Dorflinger | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Rao | first3 = S.

This often results in a reflexive saccade. Since exogenous cues are typically presented in the periphery, they are referred to as ''peripheral cues''. Exogenous orienting can even be observed when individuals are aware that the cue will not relay reliable, accurate information about where a target is going to occur. This means that the mere presence of an exogenous cue will affect the response to other stimuli that are subsequently presented in the cue's previous location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/ferber/teaching/visualattention/readings/Oct6/1998_Friesen_Kingstone_PBR.pdf|doi=10.3758/BF03208827|title=The eyes have it!

Several studies have investigated the influence of valid and invalid cues.&lt;ref name="Posner, M. I. 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=1775667|year=1991|author1=Cheal|first1=M|title=Central and peripheral precuing of forced-choice discrimination|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology: A, Human Experimental Psychology|volume=43|issue=4|pages=859–80|last2=Lyon|first2=DR |doi=10.1080/14640749108400960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonides, J. (1981). "Voluntary versus automatic control over the mind's eye movement". In J.B. Long &amp; A.D Braddely (Eds.) ''Attention and performance IX'' (pp. 187–203)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=6224890|year=1983|author1=Tsal|first1=Y|title=Movements of attention across the visual field|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|volume=9|issue=4|pages=523–30|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.9.4.523}}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that valid peripheral cues benefit performance, for instance when the peripheral cues are brief flashes at the relevant location before to the onset of a visual stimulus. Posner and Cohen (1984) noted a reversal of this benefit takes place when the interval between the onset of the cue and the onset of the target is longer than about 300 ms.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, M.I., &amp; Cohen, Y.P.C. (1984) "Components of visual orienting". In H. Bouma &amp; D. Bouwhuis (Eds.), ''Attention and performance X'' (pp. 531–566). London: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon  of valid cues producing longer reaction times than invalid cues is called [[inhibition of return]].

''Endogenous'' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''endo'', meaning "within" or "internally") orienting is the intentional allocation of attentional resources to a predetermined location or space.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Mayer, A.R. 2004" /&gt; ???--&gt; Simply stated, endogenous orienting occurs when attention is oriented according to an observer's goals or desires, allowing the focus of attention to be manipulated by the demands of a task. In order to have an effect, endogenous cues must be processed by the observer and acted upon purposefully. These cues are frequently referred to as ''central cues''. This is because they are typically presented at the center of a display, where an observer's eyes are likely to be fixated. Central cues, such as an arrow or digit presented at fixation, tell observers to attend to a specific location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hodgson | first1 = T.

When examining differences between exogenous and endogenous orienting, some researchers suggest that there are four differences between the two kinds of cues: 
* exogenous orienting is less affected by [[cognitive load]] than endogenous orienting; 
* observers are able to ignore endogenous cues but not exogenous cues;
* exogenous cues have bigger effects than endogenous cues; and
* expectancies about cue validity and predictive value affects endogenous orienting more than exogenous orienting.&lt;ref&gt;Jonides, J. (1981).

There exist both overlaps and differences in the areas of the brain that are responsible for endogenous and exogenous orientating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = A.

Researchers of this school have described two different aspects of how the mind focuses attention to items present in the environment. The first aspect is called bottom-up processing, also known as stimulus-driven attention or [[exogeny|exogenous]] attention. These describe attentional processing which is driven by the properties of the objects themselves. Some processes, such as motion or a sudden loud noise, can attract our attention in a pre-conscious, or non-volitional way. We attend to them whether we want to or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=2011456|year=1991|author1=Theeuwes|first1=J|title=Exogenous and endogenous control of attention: The effect of visual onsets and offsets|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|volume=49|issue=1|pages=83–90|doi=10.3758/bf03211619}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects of attention are thought to involve [[parietal lobe|parietal]] and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] cortices, as well as the [[brainstem]].&lt;ref name="Posner"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=2183676|url=http://cns-web.bu.edu/Profiles/Mingolla.html/cnsftp/cn730-2007-pdf/posner_petersen90.pdf|year=1990|author1=Posner|first1=M.

The second aspect is called top-down processing, also known as goal-driven, [[endogeny|endogenous]] attention, [[Attentional Control|attentional control]] or [[executive functions|executive]] attention. This aspect of our attentional orienting is under the control of the person who is attending.

The perceptual considers the subject’s ability to perceive or ignore stimuli, both task-related and non task-related. Studies show that if there are many stimuli present (especially if they are task-related), it is much easier to ignore the non-task related stimuli, but if there are few stimuli the mind will perceive the irrelevant stimuli as well as the relevant. The cognitive refers to the actual processing of the stimuli. Studies regarding this showed that the ability to process stimuli decreased with age, meaning that younger people were able to perceive more stimuli and fully process them, but were likely to process both relevant and irrelevant information, while older people could process fewer stimuli, but usually processed only relevant information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavie |first1=Nilli |last2=Hirst |first2=Aleksandra |last3=de Fockert |first3=Jan W. |last4=Viding |first4=Essi |year=2004 |title=Load theory of selective attention and cognitive control |url=http://www.icn.ucl.ac.uk/lavielab/reprints/Lavie-etal-04.pdf |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |pages=339–54 |volume=133 |issue=3 |pmid=15355143 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.133.3.339 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626052615/http://www.icn.ucl.ac.uk/lavielab/reprints/lavie-etal-04.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people can process multiple stimuli, e.g. trained morse code operators have been able to copy 100% of a message while carrying on a meaningful conversation.  This relies on the reflexive response due to "overlearning" the skill of morse code reception/detection/transcription so that it is an autonomous function requiring no specific attention to perform.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Clinical model===
Attention is best described as the sustained focus of cognitive resources on information while filtering or ignoring extraneous information. Attention is a very basic function that often is a precursor to all other neurological/cognitive functions. As is frequently the case, clinical models of attention differ from investigation models. One of the most used models for the evaluation of attention in patients with very different [[neurologic]] pathologies is the model of Sohlberg and Mateer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McKay Moore Sohlberg |author2=Catherine A. Mateer |title=Introduction to cognitive rehabilitation: theory and practice |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-89862-738-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hierarchic model is based in the recovering of attention processes of [[brain damage]] patients after [[coma]]. Five different kinds of activities of growing difficulty are described in the model; connecting with the activities those patients could do as their recovering process advanced.
* '''Focused attention:''' The ability to respond discretely to specific visual, [[Auditory spatial attention|auditory]] or tactile stimuli.
* '''Sustained attention ([[Vigilance Theory|vigilance]] and [[attentional control|concentration]]):''' The ability to maintain a consistent behavioral response during continuous and repetitive activity.
* '''Selective attention:''' The ability to maintain a behavioral or cognitive set in the face of distracting or competing stimuli. Therefore, it incorporates the notion of "freedom from distractibility."
* '''Alternating attention:''' The ability of mental flexibility that allows individuals to shift their focus of attention and move between tasks having different cognitive requirements.
* '''Divided attention:''' This refers to the ability to respond simultaneously to multiple tasks or multiple task demands.

This model has been shown to be very useful in evaluating attention in very different pathologies, correlates strongly with daily difficulties and is especially helpful in designing stimulation programs such as attention process training, a rehabilitation program for neurological patients of the same authors.
* '''[[Mindfulness]]:'''  Mindfulness has been conceptualized as a clinical model of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carmody|first=James|date=2009|title=Evolving Conceptions of Mindfulness in Clinical Settings|url=|journal=Journal of Cognitive Therapy; New York|volume=23 | issue = 3 |pages=270–280|via=|doi=10.1891/0889-8391.23.3.270}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mindfulness]] practices are clinical interventions that emphasize training attention functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kabat-Zinn|first=Jon|date=2015|title=Mindfulness|url=|journal=Mindfulness|volume=6 | issue = 6 |pages=1481–1483|via=|doi=10.1007/s12671-015-0456-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neural correlates===
Most experiments show that one [[neural correlate]] of attention is enhanced firing. If a neuron has a certain response to a stimulus when the animal is not attending to the stimulus, then when the animal does attend to the stimulus, the neuron's response will be enhanced even if the physical characteristics of the stimulus remain the same.

In a 2007 review, Knudsen&lt;ref name="Knudsen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Knudsen, Eric I |title=Fundamental Components of Attention |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=57–78 |year= 2007 |pmid=17417935 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.30.051606.094256}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes a more general [[Conceptual model|model]] which identifies four core processes of attention, with [[working memory]] at the center:
* [[Working memory]] temporarily stores information for detailed analysis.
* Competitive selection is the process that determines which information gains access to working memory.
* Through top-down sensitivity control, higher cognitive processes can regulate signal intensity in information channels that compete for access to working memory, and thus give them an advantage in the process of competitive selection. Through top-down sensitivity control, the momentary content of working memory can influence the selection of new information, and thus mediate voluntary control of attention in a recurrent loop (endogenous attention).&lt;ref name="Pattyn"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2007.09.016 | pmid = 17999934 | last1 = Pattyn | first1 = N. | last2 = Neyt | first2 = X. | last3 = Henderickx | first3 = D. | last4 = Soetens | first4 = E. | year = 2008 | title = Psychophysiological Investigation of Vigilance Decrement: Boredom or Cognitive Fatigue? | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 93 | pages = 369–378 | issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bottom-up saliency filters automatically enhance the response to infrequent stimuli, or stimuli of instinctive or learned biological relevance (exogenous attention).&lt;ref name="Pattyn"/&gt;

Neurally, at different hierarchical levels spatial maps can enhance or inhibit activity in sensory areas, and induce orienting behaviors like eye movement.
* At the top of the hierarchy, the [[frontal eye fields]] (FEF) and the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] contain a retinocentric spatial map. [[Microstimulation]] in the FEF induces monkeys to make a [[saccade]] to the relevant location. Stimulation at levels too low to induce a saccade will nonetheless enhance cortical responses to stimuli located in the relevant area.
* At the next lower level, a variety of spatial maps are found in the [[parietal cortex]]. In particular, the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) contains a saliency map and is interconnected both with the FEF and with sensory areas.
* Certain automatic responses that influence attention, like orienting to a highly salient stimulus, are mediated subcortically by the [[superior colliculi]].
* At the neural network level, it is thought that processes like [[lateral inhibition]] mediate the process of competitive selection.

In many cases attention produces changes in the [[EEG]]. Many animals, including humans, produce [[gamma wave]]s (40–60&amp;nbsp;Hz) when focusing attention on a particular object or activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Kaiser J, Lutzenberger W |title=Induced gamma-band activity and human brain function |journal=Neuroscientist |volume=9 |pages=475–84 |year=2003 |pmid=14678580 |doi=10.1177/1073858403259137 |issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siegel M, Donner TH, Oostenveld R, Fries P, Engel AK |title=Neuronal synchronization along the dorsal visual pathway reflects the focus of spatial attention |journal=[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]] |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=709–719 |date=Mar 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2008.09.010 |pmid=19038226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gregoriou GG, Gotts SJ, Zhou H, Desimone R |title=High-frequency, long-range coupling between prefrontal and visual cortex during attention |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=324 |issue=5931 |pages=1207–1210 |date=Mar 2009 |doi=10.1126/science.1171402 |bibcode=2009Sci...324.1207G |pmid=19478185 |pmc=2849291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baldauf D, Desimone R |title=Neural mechanisms of object-based attention |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=344 |issue=6182 |pages=424–427 |date=Mar 2014 |pmid=24763592 |doi=10.1126/science.1247003 |bibcode=2014Sci...344..424B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another commonly used model for the attention system has been put forth by researchers such as [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Michael Posner]]. He divides attention into three functional components: alerting, orienting, and [[Executive system|executive attention]]&lt;ref name="Posner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0031333|title=Components of attention|journal=Psychological Review|volume=78|issue=5|pages=391–408|year=1971|last1=Posner|first1=Michael I.|last2=Boies|first2=Stephen J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can also interact and influence each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trautwein|first=Fynn-Mathis|last2=Singer|first2=Tania|last3=Kanske|first3=Philipp|date=2016-08-22|title=Stimulus-Driven Reorienting Impairs Executive Control of Attention: Evidence for a Common Bottleneck in Anterior Insula|journal=Cerebral Cortex (New York, N.Y.: 1991)|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhw225|issn=1460-2199|pmc=5066828|pmid=27550866|volume=26|issue=11|pages=4136–4147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fan|first=Jin|last2=Gu|first2=Xiaosi|last3=Guise|first3=Kevin G.|last4=Liu|first4=Xun|last5=Fossella|first5=John|last6=Wang|first6=Hongbin|last7=Posner|first7=Michael I.|date=2009-07-01|title=Testing the behavioral interaction and integration of attentional networks|journal=Brain and Cognition|volume=70|issue=2|pages=209–220|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2009.02.002|issn=1090-2147|pmc=2674119|pmid=19269079}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callejas|first=Alicia|last2=Lupiáñez|first2=Juan|last3=Tudela|first3=Pı́o|date=2004-04-01|title=The three attentional networks: On their independence and interactions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262604000302|journal=Brain and Cognition|volume=54|issue=3|pages=225–227|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2004.02.012|pmid=15050779}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alerting is the process involved in becoming and staying attentive toward the surroundings. It appears to exist in the [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[Parietal lobe|parietal]] lobes of the [[right hemisphere]], and is modulated by [[norepinephrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=8904746|year=1996|author1=Coull|first1=J.

* Orienting is the directing of attention to a specific stimulus.
* Executive attention is used when there is a conflict between multiple attention cues. It is essentially the same as the [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Central executive|central executive]] in [[Baddeley's model of working memory]]. The [[Eriksen flanker task]] has shown that the executive control of attention may take place in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]]&lt;ref&gt;Fan, J., McCandliss, B. D., Flombaum, J. I., Thomas, K.

===Cultural variation===
Children appear to develop patterns of attention related to the cultural practices of their families, communities, and the institutions in which they participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correa-Chavez|first=Maricela|author2=Barbara Rogoff|title=Cultural variation in childrens attention and learning|journal=Psychology and the Real World: Essays Illustrating Fundamental Contributions to Society|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, [[Jules Henry]] suggested that there are societal differences in sensitivity to signals from many ongoing sources that call for the awareness of several levels of attention simultaneously. He tied his speculation to ethnographic observations of communities in which children are involved in a complex social community with multiple relationships.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chavajay|first=Pablo|title=Cultural variation in management of attention by children and their caregivers|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1999|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1079–1090|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.35.4.1079|pmid=10442876|last2=Rogoff|first2=Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous children in the Americas]] predominantly learn by [[Observational Learning|observing]] and pitching in. There are several studies to support that the use of keen attention towards learning is much more common in Indigenous Communities of North and Central America than in a middle-class European-American setting.&lt;ref name="Rogoff 2011 1–18"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|author2=Correa-Chavez, M. |author3=Silva, K. G. |title=Cultural variation in children's attention  and learning|journal=Psychology and the Real World: Essays Illustrating Fundamental Contributions to Society|date=2011|pages=1–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a direct result of the [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In]] model.

Keen attention is both a requirement and result of learning by observing and pitching-in. Incorporating the children in the community gives them the opportunity to keenly observe and contribute to activities that were not directed towards them. It can be seen from different Indigenous communities and cultures, such as the [[Mayans]] of [[San Pedro La Laguna|San Pedro]], that children can simultaneously attend to multiple events.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Most [[Maya peoples|Maya]] children have learned to pay attention to several events at once in order to make useful observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|title=The Cultural Nature of Human Development|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195131338|date=2003-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example is simultaneous attention which involves uninterrupted attention to several activities occurring at the same time. Another cultural practice that may relate to simultaneous attention strategies is coordination within a group. San Pedro toddlers and caregivers frequently coordinated their activities with other members of a group in multiway engagements rather than in a dyadic fashion.&lt;ref name="Chavajay 1999 1079–1090"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morelli/&gt; Research concludes that children with close ties to Indigenous American roots have a high tendency to be especially keen observers.&lt;ref name="Silva 2010 898–912"/&gt;

This learning by observing and pitching-in model requires active levels of attention management. The child is present while caretakers engage in daily activities and responsibilities such as: weaving, farming, and other skills necessary for survival. Being present allows the child to focus their attention on the actions being performed by their parents, elders, and/or older siblings.&lt;ref name="Rogoff 2011 1–18"/&gt; In order to learn in this way, keen attention and focus is required. Eventually the child is expected to be able to perform these skills themselves.

===Modelling===

In the domain of [[computer vision]], efforts have been made to model the mechanism of human attention, especially the bottom-up intentional mechanism&lt;ref name="Li J, Levine MD, An X, Xu X, He H 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Li J, Levine MD, An X, Xu X, He H |title=Visual Saliency Based on Scale-Space Analysis in the Frequency Domain |journal=IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell|volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=996–1010 |year=2012|doi=10.1109/TPAMI.2012.147|pmid=22802112 |arxiv=1605.01999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its semantic significance in classification of video contents.&lt;ref name="Zang Wang Liu Zhang 2018 pp. 97–108"&gt;{{cite book | last=Zang | first=Jinliang | last2=Wang | first2=Le | last3=Liu | first3=Ziyi | last4=Zhang | first4=Qilin | last5=Hua | first5=Gang | last6=Zheng | first6=Nanning | title=IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology | chapter=Attention-Based Temporal Weighted Convolutional Neural Network for Action Recognition | publisher=Springer International Publishing | location=Cham | year=2018 | isbn=978-3-319-92006-1 | issn=1868-4238 | doi=10.1007/978-3-319-92007-8_9 | pages=97–108 | arxiv=1803.07179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang Zang Zhang Niu p=1979"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wang | first=Le | last2=Zang | first2=Jinliang | last3=Zhang | first3=Qilin | last4=Niu | first4=Zhenxing | last5=Hua | first5=Gang | last6=Zheng | first6=Nanning | title=Action Recognition by an Attention-Aware Temporal Weighted Convolutional Neural Network | journal=Sensors | volume=18 | issue=7 | date=2018-06-21 | issn=1424-8220 | doi=10.3390/s18071979 | pmid=29933555 | pmc=6069475 | page=1979 | url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/sensors-18-01979-Action_Recognition_by_an_Attention-Aware_Temporal_Weighted_Convolutional_Neural_Network.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Visual spatial attention|spatial attention]] and [[Visual temporal attention|temporal attention]] have been incorporated in such classification efforts.

Generally speaking, there are two kinds of models to mimic the bottom-up salience mechanism in static images. One way is based on the spatial contrast analysis. For example, a center–surround mechanism has been used to define salience across scales, inspired by the putative neural mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Laurent Itti |author2=Christof Koch |author3=Ernst Niebur |title=A Model of Saliency-Based Visual Attention for Rapid Scene Analysis |journal=IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell|volume=20 |issue=11 |pages=1254–1259 |year=1998|doi=10.1109/34.730558 |citeseerx=10.1.1.53.2366 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been hypothesized that some visual inputs are intrinsically salient in certain background contexts and that these are actually task-independent. This model has established itself as the exemplar for salience detection and consistently used for comparison in the literature;&lt;ref name="Li J, Levine MD, An X, Xu X, He H 2012"/&gt; the other way is based on the frequency domain analysis. This method was first proposed by Hou et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Hou X, Zhang L |doi=10.1109/CVPR.2007.383267 |url=http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~xhou/papers/cvpr07.pdf |access-date=2015-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212171627/http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~xhou/papers/cvpr07.pdf |archive-date=2015-02-12 |dead-url=yes |df= |title=2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition |pages=1–8 |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4244-1179-5 |chapter=Saliency Detection: A Spectral Residual Approach |citeseerx=10.1.1.579.1650 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this method was called SR, and then PQFT method was also introduced. Both SR and PQFT only use the phase information.&lt;ref name="Li J, Levine MD, An X, Xu X, He H 2012"/&gt; In 2012, the HFT method was introduced, and both the amplitude and the phase information are made use of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Levine MD, An X, Xu X, He H |title=Visual Saliency Based on Scale-Space Analysis in the Frequency Domain |journal=IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=996–1010 |year=2012 |doi=10.1109/TPAMI.2012.147 |pmid=22802112 |url=http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~lijian/06243147.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301015810/http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~lijian/06243147.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-01 |df= |arxiv=1605.01999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hemispatial neglect===
{{Main|Hemispatial neglect}}
Hemispatial neglect, also called ''unilateral neglect'', often occurs when people have damage to their right hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Kalat, J. W. 2013"&gt;Kalat, J. W. (2013). ''Biological Psychology (11th ed''.). Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; This damage often leads to a tendency to ignore the left side of one's body or even the left side of an object that can be seen. Damage to the left side of the brain (the left hemisphere) rarely yields significant neglect of the right side of the body or object in the person's local environments.&lt;ref name="Silveri, M. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21639641|year=2011|author1=Silveri|first1=M. C.|title=Unilateral spatial neglect in degenerative brain pathology|journal=Neuropsychology|volume=25|issue=5|pages=554–66|last2=Ciccarelli|first2=N|last3=Cappa|first3=A|doi=10.1037/a0023957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of spatial neglect, however, may vary and differ depending on what area of the brain was damaged. Damage to different neural substrates can result in different types of neglect. Attention disorders (lateralized and nonlaterized) may also contribute to the symptoms and effects.&lt;ref name="Silveri, M. 2011"/&gt; Much research has asserted that damage to gray matter within the brain results in spatial neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19168667|pmc=2742593|year=2009|author1=Karnath|first1=H.

F.|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhn250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technology has yielded more information, such that there is a large, distributed network of frontal, parietal, temporal, and subcortical brain areas that have been tied to neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Buxbaum L. J. | year = 2006 | title = On the right (and left) track: Twenty years of progress in studying hemispatial neglect | url = | journal = Cognitive Neuropsychology | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 184–201 | doi=10.1080/02643290500202698| pmid = 21049327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This network can be related to other research as well; the [[dorsal attention network]] is tied to spatial orienting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20861361|year=2010|author1=Ptak|first1=R|title=The dorsal attention network mediates orienting toward behaviorally relevant stimuli in spatial neglect|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=30|issue=38|pages=12557–65|last2=Schnider|first2=A|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2722-10.2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of damage to this network may result in patients neglecting their left side when distracted about their right side or an object on their right side.&lt;ref name="Kalat, J. W. 2013"/&gt;

===Attention in social contexts===

'''Social attention''' is one special form of attention that involves the allocation of limited processing resources in a social context. Previous studies on social attention often regard how attention is directed toward socially relevant stimuli such as faces and gaze directions of other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=J. T.|last2=Shepherd|first2=S. V.|last3=Platt|first3=M. L.|title=Social attention and the brain|journal=Current Biology|date=2009|volume=19|issue=20|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.08.010|pmid=19889376|pmc=3387539|pages=R958–R962|bibcode=1996CBio....6.1213A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to attending-to-others, a different line of researches has shown that self-related information such as own face and name automatically captures attention and is preferentially processed comparing to other-related information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humphreys|first1=G. W.|last2=Sui|first2=J.|title=Attentional control and the self: the Self-Attention Network (SAN)|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2016|volume=21|issue=1–4|doi=10.1080/17588928.2015.1044427|pmid=25945926|pages=5–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; These contrasting effects between attending-to-others and attending-to-self prompt a synthetic view in a recent Opinion article &lt;ref name="journal.frontiersin.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuang|first1=S.|title=Two Polarities of Attention in Social Contexts: From Attending-to-Others to Attending-to-Self|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=2016|volume=7|page=63|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00063|pmid=26869965|pmc=4734343}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposing that social attention operates at two polarizing states: In one extreme, individual tends to attend to the self and prioritize self-related information over others', and, in the other extreme, attention is allocated to other individuals to infer their intentions and desires. Attending-to-self and attending-to-others mark the two ends of an otherwise continuum spectrum of social attention. For a given behavioral context, the mechanisms underlying these two polarities might interact and compete with each other in order to determine a saliency map of social attention that guides our behaviors.&lt;ref name="journal.frontiersin.org"/&gt; An imbalanced competition between these two behavioral and cognitive processes will cause cognitive disorders and neurological symptoms such as [[autism spectrum]] disorders and [[Williams syndrome]].

==History of the study==

===Philosophical period===
Psychologist [[Daniel Berlyne|Daniel E. Berlyne]] credits the first extended treatment of attention to philosopher [[Nicolas Malebranche]] in his work "The Search After Truth". "Malebranche held that we have access to ideas, or mental representations  of the external world, but not direct access to the world itself."&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004 1–24"/&gt; Thus in order to keep these ideas organized, attention is necessary. Otherwise we will confuse these ideas. Malebranche writes in "The Search After Truth", "because it often happens that the understanding has only confused and imperfect perceptions of things, it is truly a cause of our errors.... It is therefore necessary to look for means to keep our perceptions from being confused and imperfect.  And, because, as everyone knows, there is nothing that makes them clearer and more distinct than attentiveness, we must try to find the means to become more attentive than we are".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malebranche|first=Nicolas|title=The Search After Truth|year=1674|pages=411–412}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Malebranche, attention is crucial to understanding and keeping thoughts organized.

Philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] introduced the concept of [[apperception]] to this philosophical approach to attention.  Apperception refers to "the process by which new experience is assimilated to and transformed by the residuum of past experience of an individual to form a new whole."&lt;ref&gt;Runes, Dagobert D. (ed.), Dictionary of Philosophy, Littlefield, Adams, and Company, Totowa, NJ, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Apperception is required for a perceived event to become a conscious event. Leibniz emphasized a reflexive involuntary view of attention known as exogenous orienting. However, there is also endogenous orienting which is voluntary and directed attention. Philosopher [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] agreed with Leibniz's view of apperception; however, he expounded on it in by saying that new experiences had to be tied to ones already existing in the mind. Herbart was also the first person to stress the importance of applying mathematical modeling to the study of psychology.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004 1–24"/&gt;

In the beginning of the 19th century, it was thought that people were not able to attend to more than one stimulus at a time. However, with research contributions by [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet]] this view was changed.  Hamilton proposed a view of attention that likened its capacity to holding marbles. You can only hold a certain amount of marbles at a time before it starts to spill over. His view states that we can attend to more than one stimulus at once. [[William Stanley Jevons]] later expanded this view and stated that we can attend to up to four items at a time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

During this period of attention, various philosophers made significant contributions to the field. They began the research on the extent of attention and how attention is directed.

===1860–1909===
This period of attention research took the focus from conceptual findings to experimental testing. It also involved psychophysical methods that allowed measurement of the relation between physical stimulus properties and the psychological perceptions of them. This period covers the development of attentional research from the founding of psychology to 1909.

[[Wilhelm Wundt]] introduced the study of attention to the field of psychology. Wundt measured mental processing speed by likening it to differences in stargazing measurements. Astronomers in this time would measure the time it took for stars to travel.  Among these measurements when astronomers recorded the times, there were personal differences in calculation. These different readings resulted in different reports from each astronomer. To correct for this, a [[personal equation]] was developed. Wundt applied this to mental processing speed. Wundt realized that the time it takes to see the stimulus of the star and write down the time was being called an "observation error" but actually was the time it takes to switch voluntarily one's attention from one stimulus to another. Wundt called his school of psychology [[voluntarism (sociology)|voluntarism]]. It was his belief that psychological processes can only be understood in terms of goals and consequences.

[[Franciscus Donders]] used [[mental chronometry]] to study attention and it was considered a major field of intellectual inquiry by authors such as [[Sigmund Freud]]. Donders and his students conducted the first detailed investigations of the speed of mental processes. Donders measured the time required to identify a stimulus and to select a motor response. This was the time difference between stimulus discrimination and response initiation.  Donders also formalized the subtractive method which states that the time for a particular process can be estimated by adding that process to a task and taking the difference in reaction time between the two tasks. He also differentiated between [[Mental chronometry|three types of reactions]]: simple reaction, choice reaction, and go/no-go reaction.

[[Hermann von Helmholtz]] also contributed to the field of attention relating to the extent of attention. Von Helmholtz stated that it is possible to focus on one stimulus and still perceive or ignore others.  An example of this is being able to focus on the letter u in the word house and still perceiving the letters h, o, s, and e.

One major debate in this period was whether it was possible to attend to two things at once (split attention). [[Walter Benjamin]] described this experience as "reception in a state of [[distraction]]." This disagreement could only be resolved through experimentation.

In 1890, [[William James]], in his textbook ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'', remarked:
{{cquote|''Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others, and is a condition which has a real opposite in the confused, dazed, scatterbrained state which in French is called distraction, and Zerstreutheit in German.''&lt;ref&gt;James, W. (1890). ''[[The Principles of Psychology]].'' New York: Henry Holt, Vol. 1, pp. 403–404.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
James differentiated between censorial attention and intellectual attention. Censorial attention is when attention is directed to objects of sense, stimuli that are physically present. Intellectual attention is attention directed to ideal or represented objects; stimuli that are not physically present. James also distinguished between immediate or derived attention: attention to the present versus to something not physically present. According to James, attention has five major effects. Attention works to make us perceive, conceive, distinguish, remember, and shorten reactions time.

===1910–1949===
During this period, research in attention waned and interest in behaviorism flourished, leading some to believe, like [[Ulric Neisser]], that in this period, "There was no research on attention". However, Jersild published very important work on "Mental Set and Shift" in 1927. He stated, "The fact of mental set is primary in all conscious activity.  The same stimulus may evoke any one of a large number of responses depending upon the contextual setting in which it is placed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jersild A.T. |year=1927|title= Mental set and shift|journal= Archives of Psychology|volume=14|issue= 89|pages= 5–82|url=https://archive.org/details/mentalsetshift00jers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research found that the time to complete a list was longer for mixed lists than for pure lists. For example, if a list was names of animals versus a list with names of animals, books, makes and models of cars, and types of fruits, it takes longer to process. This is [[Task switching (psychology)|task switching]].

In 1931, Telford discovered the [[psychological refractory period]].  The stimulation of neurons is followed by a refractory phase during which neurons are less sensitive to stimulation. In 1935 [[John Ridley Stroop]] developed the Stroop Task which elicited the [[Stroop Effect]]. Stroop's task showed that irrelevant stimulus information can have a major impact on performance.  In this task, subjects were to look at a list of colors. This list of colors had each color typed in a color different from the actual text. For example, the word Blue would be typed in Orange, Pink in Black, and so on.

Example:  '''&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;Purple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:brown"&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Purple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:purple"&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt;'''

Subjects were then instructed to say the name of the ink color and ignore the text. It took 110 seconds to complete a list of this type compared to 63 seconds to name the colors when presented in the form of solid squares.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004 1–24"/&gt; The naming time nearly doubled in the presence  of conflicting color words, an effect known as the Stroop Effect.

===1950–1974===
In the 1950s, [[Psychologist#Research Psychologists|research psychologists]] renewed their interest in attention when the dominant epistemology shifted from positivism (i.e., [[behaviorism]]) to [[philosophical realism|realism]] during what has come to be known as the "[[cognitive revolution]]".&lt;ref&gt;Harré, Rom. ''Cognitive science: A philosophical introduction''. London: SAGE Publications, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7619-4746-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cognitive revolution admitted unobservable cognitive processes like attention as legitimate objects of scientific study.

Modern research on attention began with the analysis of the "[[cocktail party effect|cocktail party problem]]" by [[Colin Cherry]] in 1953. At a cocktail party how do people select the conversation that they are listening to and ignore the rest? This problem is at times called "focused attention", as opposed to "divided attention". Cherry performed a number of experiments which became known as [[dichotic listening]] and were extended by [[Donald Broadbent]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding cognition'' by Peter J. Hampson, Peter Edwin Morris 1996 {{ISBN|0-631-15751-4}} p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical experiment, subjects would use a set of [[headphones]] to listen to two streams of words in different [[ears]] and selectively attend to one stream. After the task, the experimenter would question the subjects about the content of the unattended stream.

[[Broadbent's Filter Model of Attention]] states that information is held in a pre-attentive temporary store, and only sensory events that have some physical feature in common are selected to pass into the limited capacity processing system.  This implies that the meaning of unattended messages is not identified. Also, a significant amount of time is required to shift the filter from one channel to another. Experiments by Gray and Wedderburn and later [[Anne Treisman]] pointed out various problems in Broadbent's early model and eventually led to the Deutsch–Norman model in 1968. In this model, no signal is filtered out, but all are processed to the point of activating their stored representations in memory. The point at which attention becomes "selective" is when one of the memory representations is selected for further processing. At any time, only one can be selected, resulting in the ''attentional bottleneck''.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding cognition'' by Peter J. Hampson, Peter Edwin Morris 1996 {{ISBN|0-631-15751-4}} pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

This debate became known as the early-selection vs. late-selection models. In the early selection models (first proposed by [[Donald Broadbent]]), attention shuts down (in [[Broadbent's Filter Model of Attention|Broadbent's model]]) or attenuates (in [[Broadbent's Filter Model of Attention#Attenuation model of attention|Triesman's refinement]]) processing in the unattended ear before the mind can analyze its semantic content. In the late selection models (first proposed by J. Anthony Deutsch and [[Diana Deutsch]]), the content in both ears is analyzed semantically, but the words in the unattended ear cannot access consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0039515 | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Deutsch | first2 = D. | year = 1963 | title = Attention: some theoretical considerations | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 70 | pages = 80–90 | pmid = 14027390 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lavie's perceptual load theory, however, ‘provided elegant solution to’ what had once been a ‘heated debate’.&lt;ref&gt;J.

{{Love sidebar|types}}
'''Broken heart''' (also known as a '''heartbreak''' or '''heartache''') is a [[metaphor]] for the intense emotional—and sometimes physical—stress or pain one feels at experiencing great [[Longing (emotion)|longing]]. The concept is cross-cultural, often cited with reference to a desired or lost lover, and dates back at least 3,000 years.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=R. Skip|title=A Broken Heart can Really Hurt You |publisher=[[BPDFamily.com]] |url=http://bpdfamily.com/content/broken-heart-can-hurt-you |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology==
The intense pain of a broken heart is believed to be part of the survival instinct. The "[[Attachment in adults|social-attachment system]]" uses the "[[Suffering|pain system]]" to encourage humans to maintain their close social relationships by causing pain when those relationships are lost.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Psychologists Geoff MacDonald of the [[University of Queensland]] and Mark Leary of [[Wake Forest University]] proposed in 2005 the evolution of common mechanisms for both physical and emotional pain responses and argue that such expressions are "more than just a metaphor".&lt;ref name=MacDonald&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacDonald|first1=Geoff|last2=Leary|first2=Mark R.|title=Why Does Social Exclusion Hurt? The Relationship Between Social and Physical Pain |publisher=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |url=http://web.psych.utoronto.ca/gmacdonald/macdonald%20&amp;%20leary,%202005a.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|University of Michigan News Service 2011}} The concept is believed to be universal, with many cultures using the same words to describe both physical pain and the feelings associated with relationship loss.&lt;ref name=MacDonald/&gt;{{sfn|University of Michigan News Service 2011}}

The neurological process involved in the perception of heartache is not known, but is thought to involve the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] of the brain, which during stress may overstimulate the [[vagus nerve]] causing pain, nausea or muscle tightness in the chest.{{sfn|Scientific American Mind 2015}} Research by [[Naomi Eisenberger]] and [[Matthew Lieberman]] of the [[University of California]] from 2008 showed that rejection is associated with activation of the dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and right-ventral [[pre-frontal cortex]], areas established as being involved in processing of pain, including empathizing with pain experienced by others.{{sfn|Scientific American Mind 2015}} The same researchers mention effect of social stressors on the heart, and personality on perception of pain.{{sfn|Eisenberger|Lieberman|2004|pp=294-300}}

A 2011 study showed that the same regions of the brain that become active in response to painful sensory experiences are activated during intense social rejection or social loss in general.{{sfn|University of Michigan News Service 2011}}{{sfn|National Academy of Sciences 2011}} Social psychologist Ethan Kross from [[University of Michigan]], who was heavily involved in the study, said, "These results give new meaning to the idea that social rejection hurts".{{sfn|University of Michigan News Service 2011}} The research implicates the [[secondary somatosensory cortex]] and the dorsal posterior [[insular cortex|insula]].{{sfn|University of Michigan News Service 2011}}

==Psychology==

=== Uncomplicated grief ===
For most bereaved individuals, the journey through grief will ultimately culminate in an acceptable level of adjustment to a life without their loved one.&lt;ref name="Zisook"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zisook|first1=Sidney|last2=Shear|first2=Katherine|title=Grief and bereavement: what psychiatrists need to know|journal=World Psychiatry|date=June 1, 2009|volume=8|issue=2|pages=67–74|pmc=2691160|doi=10.1002/j.2051-5545.2009.tb00217.x|pmid=2691160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kübler-Ross model]] postulates that there are five stages of grief after the loss of a loved-one: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,689491,00.html|title= Milestones |date=Aug 30, 2004  |publisher=TIME | first=Sarah M. | last=Broom}}&lt;/ref&gt; And while it is recognized that mourners go through initial period of numbness leading to depression and finally to reorganization and recovery, most modern grief specialists recognize the variations and fluidity of grief experiences differ considerably in intensity and length among cultural groups, individually from person to person&lt;ref name="Zisook"/&gt; as well as depending on the amount of investment put into the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Getting Over A Breakup Is A Chance|url=https://www.coaching-online.org/blog/relationship/getting-over-a-breakup/#redefine|publisher=Coaching Online|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruminating, or having intrusive thoughts that are continuous, uncontrollable, and distressing,{{sfn|Carll|2007|p=111}} is often a component of grieving. [[John Bowlby]]'s concept of '''searching for the lost object''' is about the anxiety and mounting frustration as the mourner remains lost, frequently sifting through memories of the departed, and perhaps fleeting perceptions of spectral visitations by the lost individual. When the loss involves 'being left' or 'unrequited love',&lt;ref&gt;Tennov, Dorothy. Love and Limerence: The Experience of Being in Love, Scarborugh House (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the above, this mental searching is accompanied by obsessive thoughts about factors leading to the breakup, and possibilities for reuniting with the lost individual.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, John, Loss: Sadness and Depression; Attachment and Loss, III, Basic Books, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; When rejection is involved, [[shame]] may also be involved – the painful feeling of being inherently unacceptable, disposable, unworthy.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helen Block. Shame and Guilt in Neurosis. Madison: International Universities Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical signs of grieving include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=Bereavement And Grief|url=http://www.homelifecountry.com/bereavement-and-grief/|publisher=HomeLifeCountry|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Exhaustion, muscle tightness or weakness, body pains, fidgety restlessness, lack of energy
# Insomnia, sleeping too much, disturbing dreams
# Loss of appetite, overeating, nausea, "hollow stomach", indigestion, intestinal disorders like diarrhea, excessive weight gain or loss
# Headaches, short of breath, chest pressure, tightness or heaviness in the throat

=== Depression ===
A broken heart is a major stressor and has been found to precipitate episodes of major [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. In one study (death of a spouse), 24% of mourners were depressed at two months, 23% at seven months, 16% at 13 months and 14% at 25 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zisook|first1=S|last2=Shuchter|first2=SR|title=Depression through the first year after the death of a spouse|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=October 1991|volume=148|issue=10|pages=1346–52|doi=10.1176/ajp.148.10.1346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are overlapping symptoms, uncomplicated grief can be distinguished from a full depressive episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Auster|first1=T|last2=Moutier|first2=C|last3=Lanouette|first3=N|title=Bereavement and depression: implications for diagnosis and treatment|journal=Psychiatric Annals|date=October 1, 2008|volume=38|pages=655–661|doi=10.3928/00485713-20081001-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major depression tends to be more pervasive and is characterized by significant difficulty in experiencing self-validating and positive feelings. Major depression is composed of a recognizable and stable cluster of debilitating symptoms, accompanied by a protracted, enduring low mood. It tends to be persistent and associated with poor work and social functioning, pathological immunological function, and other neurobiological changes, unless treated.&lt;ref name="Zisook"/&gt;

In relationship breakups, mourners may turn their anger about the rejection toward themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colin|first1=Virginia A.|title=Human Attachment|date=1996|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can deepen the depression&lt;ref&gt;Schore, Allan. Affect Regulation and Origin of Self: The Neurobiology of Emotional Development. Mahwah: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1994, pp. 416-422&lt;/ref&gt; and cause narcissistic wounding.&lt;ref&gt;Kohut, H. The Restoration of the Self Madison: International Universities Press, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of self-attack can range from mild self-doubt to scathing self recrimination which leaves a lasting imprint on individuals' self-worth, and causes them to doubt their lovability, personality-efficacy, and attachment worthiness going forward.&lt;ref&gt;Robertiello, Richard. Hold Them Very Close, Then Let Them Go. New York: Dial, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological trauma ===
In severe cases, the depression of a broken heart can create a sustained type of stress that constitutes an [[Psychological trauma|emotional trauma]] which can be severe enough to leave an emotional imprint on individuals' psychobiological functioning, affecting future choices and responses to rejection, loss, or disconnection.&lt;ref name="Van der Kolk"&gt;{{cite book |last= van der Kolk |first= Bessel A |author-link= Bessel van der Kolk |last2= McFarlane |first2= Alexander C |last3= Weisæth |first3= Lars |author-link3= Lars Weisæth |date= 1996 |title= Traumatic Stress: The Effects of Overwhelming Experience on Mind, Body, and Society |location= New York |publisher= Guilford Press |isbn= 978-1-5723-0088-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A contributing factor to the trauma-producing event is that 'being left' can trigger primal separation fear – the fear of being left with no one to take care of one's vital needs.

Mourners may also experience the intense stress of helplessness.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, Martin. Helplessness: On Depression, Development and Death. San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; If they make repeated attempts to compel their loved one to return and are unsuccessful, they will feel helpless and inadequate to the task. Feeling one's 'limited capacity' can produce a fault line in the psyche which renders the person prone to heightened emotional responses within primary relationships.&lt;ref name="Balint "&gt;Balint, Michael. The Basic Fault: Therapeutic Aspects of Regression. Evanston: North Western University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor contributing to the traumatic conditions is the stress of losing someone with whom the mourner has come to rely in ways they did not realize.&lt;ref&gt;Winnecott, Donald W. "The Capacity to be Alone." In The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment: Studies in the Theory of Emotional Development. Madison: International Universities Press, 1965 ; {{cite journal | author = Robertiello Richard, Gagnier Terril T | year = 1993 | title = Sado-masochism as a Defense Against Merging: Six Case Studies | url = | journal = Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 183–192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in time, couples can become external regulators for one another, attuned on many levels: pupils dilated in synchrony, echoing one another's speech patterns, movements, and even cardiac and EEG rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;Tiffany Field, "Attachment as Psychobiological Attunement: Being on the Same Wavelength," in The Psychobiology of Attachment and Separation, pp. 445-448.&lt;/ref&gt;  Couples can function like a mutual bio-feedback system, stimulating and modulating each other's bio rhythms, responding to one another's pheromones,&lt;ref&gt;L. Monti-Bloch, and B. I.

Molecules of Emotion.

=== Posttraumatic stress disorder ===
Research has shown that in extreme cases, some who experience a broken heart go on to develop [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="goleman"&gt;Goleman, Daniel. The Emotional Brain and Emotional Intelligence: New Insights. North Hampton, Mass, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various predisposing psycho-biological and environmental factors that go into determining whether one's earlier emotional trauma might lead to the development of a true clinical picture of posttraumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="Van der Kolk"/&gt;  This would lower their threshold for becoming aroused and make them more likely to become anxious when they encounter stresses in life that are reminiscent of childhood separations and fears, hence more prone to becoming posttraumatic.

Another factor is that insecure attachments in childhood have shown to predispose the individuals to difficulties in forming secure attachments in adulthood and to having heightened responses to rejection and loss.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, Mary D. S. "Attachments and Other Affectional Bonds Across the Life Cycle." In Attachments Across the Life Cycle. New York: Routledge, 1991; Horney, Karen Horney, K. The neurotic personality of our time. New York: W. W. Norton and Company (1937).&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also variation in individuals' neurochemical systems that govern the stress regulation. Depending on the severity of the stress response induced in an individual by an event (i.e. a romantic breakup), certain concentrations of stress hormones including CRF, ACTH, and cortisol work to intensify the imprinting of an emotional memory of the event, indelibly inscribing its fears and other sensations in the amygdala (to serve as a warning for future events),&lt;ref&gt;LeDoux, Joseph. "Emotion, Memory and the Brain." Scientific American (June 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; while the same stress hormones can act to impede.&lt;ref name="goleman"/&gt;

==Medical complications ==

===Broken heart syndrome===
{{main|Takotsubo cardiomyopathy}}
In many legends and fictional tales, characters die after suffering a devastating loss; however, even in reality people die from what appears to be a broken heart. ''[[Broken heart syndrome]]'' is commonly described as a physical pain in the heart or chest area, which is due to the emotional stress caused by a traumatic breakup or the death of a loved one.{{sfn|Mayo Clinic 2015}}

Broken heart syndrome mimics symptoms of a heart attack, but it is clinically different from a heart attack because the patients have few risk factors for heart disease and were previously healthy prior to the heart muscles weakening.{{sfn|Mayo Clinic 2015}} Some [[echocardiogram]]s expressed how the left [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]], of people with the broken heart syndrome, was contracting normally but the middle and upper sides of the heart muscle had weaker contractions due to inverted [[T wave]]s and longer Q-T intervals that are associated with [[stress (psychological)|stress]].{{sfn|Lumb|2014|p=51}} Magnetic resonance images suggested that the recovery rates for those suffering from broken heart syndrome are faster than those who had heart attacks and complete recovery to the heart is achieved within two months.{{sfn|Mayo Clinic 2015}}

===Endocrine and immune dysfunction===
Physiological and biochemical changes that contribute to higher physical illnesses and heart diseases have been found in individuals that have high levels of anxiety and depression. Some individuals who have divorced have compromised immune systems because of inflammatory cytokines followed by a state of depression.{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=382-387}}

==Cultural references==
Biblical references to the pain of a broken heart date back to 1015&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Psalm%2069%3A20 "Why is Bible engagement down in the digital age? Bible Gateway's Rachel Barach shares some insight"]. [[Biblegateway]]. Retrieved 5 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
:Insults have broken my heart and left me weak, I looked for sympathy but there was none; I found no one to comfort me ([[Psalms|Psalm]] 69:20)

[[Rudaki]], regarded as the first great genius of Persian poetry, used broken heart imagery in his writing.
:Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man
:Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.

[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' features a character, [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32&amp;nbsp;BC)#Character in Shakespeare|Enobarbus]], who dies of a broken heart after betraying a friend.

'''Charity''' is an English feminine given name derived from the English word ''[[charity (virtue)|charity]]''. It was used by the [[Puritans]] as a [[virtue name]]. An earlier form of the name, Caritas, was an early Christian name in use by Romans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Campbell |url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/charity |title=Meaning, origin and history of the name Charity |publisher=Behind the Name |date= |accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charity is also the usual English form of the name of [[Saints Faith, Hope and Charity|Saint Charity]], an early Christian child martyr, who was tortured to death with her sisters Faith and Hope. She is known as Agape in [[Koine Greek|Biblical Greek]] and as Caritas in [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Church Latin]] and her name is translated differently in other languages.

Faith, Hope and Charity, the [[theological virtues|three theological virtues]], are names traditionally given to [[Multiple birth|triplet]] girls, just as Faith and Hope remain common names for [[twin]] girls. One example were the American triplets Faith, Hope and Charity Cardwell, who were born in 1899 in [[Texas]] and were recognized in 1994 by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the world's longest lived triplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howe |first=Sam |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/garden/at-home-with-faith-hope-and-charity-285-years-young.html |title=AT HOME WITH - Faith, Hope and Charity - 285 Years Young |location=Sweetwater (Tex) |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1994-07-07 |accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charity has never been as popular a name in the [[United States]] as [[Faith (given name)|Faith]] or [[Hope (given name)|Hope]]. It ranked in the top 500 names for American girls between 1880 and 1898 and in the top 1,000 between 1880 and 1927, when it disappeared from the top 1,000 names until it reemerged among the top 1,000 names in 1968 at No. 968. It was most popular between 1973 and 1986, when it ranked among the top 300 names in the United States. It has since declined in popularity and was ranked at No. 852 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/babyname.cgi |title=Popular Baby Names |publisher=Ssa.gov |date=2015-02-12 |accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''coincidence point''' (or simply '''coincidence''') of two [[function (mathematics)|mappings]] is a point in their common [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] having the same image.

Formally, given two mappings
:&lt;math&gt;f,g \colon X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;
we say that a point ''x'' in ''X'' is a ''coincidence point'' of ''f'' and ''g'' if ''f''(''x'') = ''g''(''x'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Coincidence theory (the study of coincidence points) is, in most settings, a generalization of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] theory, the study of points ''x'' with ''f''(''x'') = ''x''. Fixed point theory is the special case obtained from the above by letting ''X = Y'' and taking ''g'' to be the [[identity mapping]].

Just as fixed point theory has its [[fixed-point theorem]]s, there are [[theorem]]s that guarantee the existence of coincidence points for pairs of mappings. Notable among them, in the setting of [[manifold]]s, is the [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem|Lefschetz coincidence theorem]], which is typically known only in its special case formulation for fixed points.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Countering Violent Extremism Task Force''', or '''CVE''', is a US government program established under the [[Obama administration]] to counter all violent ideologies, held by groups or individuals in the US, by engaging communities in the [[counterterrorism]] effort and by education programs or counter-messaging. The program works with community groups such as local governments, police departments, universities, and non-profits.

In December 2016, the incoming [[Trump presidency|Trump]] presidential transition team planned to stop the program from targeting [[white supremacy|white supremacists]], which have committed bombings and shootings such as at a [[Charleston church shooting|black church in Charleston]]. The program was also planned to be renamed to "Countering Radical Islamic Extremism". [[US Congress|Congressional]] [[GOP|Republicans]] have criticized CVE for being [[political correctness|politically correct]], arguing that using the term "Radical Islam" would prevent violent attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ainsley|first1=Julia Edwards|last2=Volz|first2=Dustin|last3=Cooke|first3=Kristina|last4=Hosenball|first4=Mark|title=Exclusive: Trump to focus counter-extremism program solely on Islam - sources|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv-idUSKBN15G5VO|accessdate=August 12, 2017|work=Reuters|date=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Acosta|first1=Jim|last2=Watkins|first2=Eli|title=Trump admin eyes scrapping anti-extremism program|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/trump-countering-violent-extremism/index.html|accessdate=12 August 2017|work=CNN|date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gjelten|first1=Tom|title=Trump Reportedly Plans To Refocus Violent Extremism Initiative On Muslims|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/02/10/514566938/trump-reportedly-plans-to-refocus-violent-extremism-initiative-on-muslims|accessdate=August 12, 2017|work=NPR|date=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evon|first1=Dan|title=Did President Trump Remove White Supremacists from the Terror Watch Program?|url=http://www.snopes.com/trump-terror-watch-program/|website=Snopes|accessdate=12 August 2017|date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beirich|first1=Heidi|title=Trump's planned changes to government's 'Countering Violent Extremism' program are politically motivated, dangerous|url=https://www.splcenter.org/news/2017/02/02/splc-trumps-planned-changes-governments-countering-violent-extremism-program-are|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=August 12, 2017|date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community groups have had concerns that the program could be used to target [[world religions|faith groups]] for [[targeted surveillance|surveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Emma|title=What Lies Ahead for Obama's Countering Violent Extremism Program?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/countering-violent-extremism/519822/|accessdate=August 12, 2017|work=The Atlantic|date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Southers|first1=Erroll|title=The U.S. government’s program to counter violent extremism needs an overhaul|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-fg-global-erroll-southers-oped-20170321-story.html|accessdate=August 12, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Montemayor|first1=Stephen|title=As Washington debates how to counter terrorism, Minnesota groups press ahead|url=http://www.startribune.com/as-washington-debates-how-to-counter-extremism-minnesota-groups-press-ahead/439497193/|accessdate=August 12, 2017|work=Star Tribune|date=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Countering Violent Extremism|url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/topic/countering-violent-extremism|website=Lawfare|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Problem with “Countering Violent Extremism” Programs|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/problem-countering-violent-extremism-programs|website=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, the Trump White House proposed to cut all funding to CVE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ainsley|first1=Julia Edwards|title=White House budget slashes 'countering violent extremism' grants|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-budget-extremism-idUSKBN18J2HJ|accessdate=12 August 2017|work=Reuters|date=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, George Selim, a Republican who worked in the [[Presidency of George W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7624">[[File:David Orrell at Art Center Global Dialogues.jpg|thumb|David Orrell (left) speaking with [[Robert Matthews (scientist)|Robert Matthews]] at the Art Center Global Dialogues, Barcelona, 2008]]'''David John Orrell''' (born 1962 in [[Edmonton]]) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] writer and [[mathematician]]. He received his doctorate in [[mathematics]] from the [[University of Oxford]]. His work in the prediction of [[complex systems]] such as the [[weather]], [[genetics]] and the [[economy]] has been featured in [[New Scientist]], the [[Financial Times]], [[Adbusters]], [[BBC Radio]], [[Russia-1 (TV channel)|Russia-1]], and [[CBC Television|CBC TV]]. He now conducts research and writes in the areas of [[systems biology]] and [[economics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.postpythagorean.com/bio.html |title=Biography| accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and runs a mathematical consultancy Systems Forecasting. He is the son of theatre historian and English professor [[John Orrell]].

His books have been translated into over ten languages. ''[[Apollo's Arrow]]: The Science of Prediction and the Future of Everything'' was a national bestseller and finalist for the 2007 Canadian Science Writers' Award. ''[[Economyths]]: Ten Ways Economics Gets It Wrong'' was a finalist for the 2011 National Business Book Award.

==Criticism of use of mathematical models==
A consistent topic in Orrell’s work is the limitations of mathematical models, and the need to acknowledge these limitations if we are to understand the causes of forecast error. He argues for example that errors in weather prediction are caused primarily by model error, rather than the [[butterfly effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| last2=Smith | first2 = Leonard | last3=Barkmeijer | first3 = Jan | last4 = Palmer | first4 = Tim | title=Model error in weather forecasting|journal=Nonlinear Proc.

By David Orrell and Roman Chlupatý|journal=Business History Review | year=2017| volume=91 | issue=2 |pages=397-399}}&lt;/ref&gt; (coauthored with journalist Roman Chlupatý) and two articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| title=A Quantum Theory of Money and Value|journal=Economic Thought | year=2016| volume=5 | issue=2 |pages=19-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| title=A Quantum Theory of Money and Value, Part 2: The Uncertainty Principle|journal=Economic Thought | year=2017| volume=6 | issue=2 |pages=14-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orrell proposed a quantum theory of money and value, which states that money has dualistic properties because it combines the properties of an owned and valued thing, with those of abstract number. The fact that these two sides of money are incompatible leads to its complex and often unpredictable behavior. In ''Quantum Economics: The New Science of Money'' he argues that these dualistic properties feed up to affect the economy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Clegg|first=Brian| url= http://popsciencebooks.blogspot.com/2018/07/quantum-economics-david-orrell.html|title=Quantum Economics - David Orrell | date=5 July 2018| accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Professional responsibility}}
In [[common law]] jurisdictions, the '''duty of confidentiality''' obliges [[solicitor]]s (or [[attorney at law|attorneys]]) to respect the confidentiality of their clients' affairs. Information that solicitors obtain about their clients' affairs may be confidential, and must not be used for the benefit of persons not authorized by the client. Confidentiality is a prerequisite for [[solicitor-client privilege|legal professional privilege]] to hold.

==The duty and its source==
The lawyer-client relationship has historically been characterised as one of confidence. This [[duty]] also constitutes part of the broader foundation for lawyer's [[fiduciary duty|fiduciary duties]] to their clients.

===Rationales for the duty===
The maintenance of full and frank disclosure between lawyers and their clients is the main justification for the duty of confidentiality.  The basis for this rationale is [[utilitarianism]], in that it works to promote the work of solicitors, who are officers of the court.  It allows clients to freely discuss intimate details without fear that such information could be subsequently disclosed to the general public. In turn, public confidence in lawyers and the legal system is maintained and promoted. Further, the duty of confidentiality is a constant reminder to lawyers of the loyalty they owe to their clients.

Another rationale is to protect the [[human dignity]] of the client.

In criminal cases, confidentiality is also justified to prevent the use of tricked [[Confession (law)|confession]]s or [[admission (law)|admission]]s.

===Source of the duty===
The duty is sourced from a combination of [[contract law]] and [[Equity (law)|equity]] arising from the distinctive relationship between lawyer and client. The solicitor or attorney is an agent of the client under the [[Agency (law)|law of agency]].  In contract, the duty arises from terms contained in the [[retainer agreement]]. Complementarily, equity prohibits unauthorised use or disclosure of confidential information. In most jurisdictions, the duty is codified in the terms of legal professional rules, such as the [[Model Code of Professional Responsibility]].

Although the duty of confidentiality and fiduciary duties have common origins, they cannot be equated as not all fiduciary duties attract duties of confidentiality and vice versa.

==Scope of the duty==
===In contract===
As the lawyer-client duty of confidentiality is primarily sourced in contract law, the wording of implied terms in the retainer agreement determines its scope of operation. Despite its importance, there have been few judicial attempts to resolve the extent of the implied term.

===In equity===
In equity, protection is attached to information that is capable of meeting the test of confidentiality - whether the information was already public knowledge and whether its communication was for a ''limited purpose''. While this test may indicate a more limited scope of confidentiality under equity, by requiring information to be deemed confidential before  falling under the scope, on another level equity may secure a broader temporal protection for confidential information. The duty under contract expires on termination of the legal retainer, whereas the duty under equity remains intact until the information is no longer confidential, which may occur long after the expiration of the contractual retainer.

===In professional rules===
Legal professional rules have tended to adopt the broad view of the scope of duty recognised in contract law. The obligation to retain information in confidence, according to the professional rules in [[Australia]]n jurisdictions is premised on its connection with the legal retainer rather than the source of the information. Hence, the professional rules seem to imply that information gained in connection with the legal retainer is deemed confidential. However, though the rules emphasise the importance of the duty of confidentiality, this is not a hard rule. Not all information connected with the retainer meets the legal test of  confidentiality. The duty of confidence applies to "any information, which is confidential to a client and acquired by [a] practitioner or [a] practitioner's firm during the client's engagement." For barristers, it is "confidential information obtained by [a] barrister concerning any person."

===Compared to legal professional privilege===
Though the duty of confidentiality shares a common origin, goals, and similarities with legal professional privilege, they are distinct in at least three ways. Firstly, privilege is not dependent on a contractual, equitable or professional duty to clients. Rather, it is based upon arguments of public policy. Secondly, communications protected by confidentiality are more numerous than those protected by privilege. Privileged communications are a subset of confidential communication. Nonetheless, loss of privilege does not necessarily automatically destroy the duty to confidentiality if it has arisen independently of the privilege. Finally, privileged information is protected from compulsory disclosure, unless abrogated by statute or waived. Non-privileged confidential information on the other hand must be disclosed to judicial, statutory, or other legal compulsion. In particular, the public interest in discovering the truth trumps private duties to respect confidence.

==Limits and exceptions to the duty==
Though the duty to confidentiality is often expressed in absolute terms in professional rules, there are circumstances where the duty can be breached. The breach of the duty in certain contexts is justified through the balancing of the often competing interests of the client and proper administration of justice

===Client authorization===
As lawyer-client confidentiality exists for the benefit of the client, the confidence is the client's to waive or modify. Hence, the lawyer can reveal confidential information to third parties where the client allows such an action. However, consent to allow the disclosure of confidential information does not entitle the lawyer to disclose or use the information for other purposes than those specified by the client.

The authorization does not necessarily have to be explicit. It can be inferred from the terms or nature of the retainer agreement. The idea that all information imparted within a retainer is confidential is impracticable. Often, much of that information is communicated so that it can be disclosed to dispose of a matter, claim, or legal issue. Hence, where information is incidental to the conduct of a retainer, client authorisation can be generally taken as given. Nonetheless, where there is uncertainty, express authority should be sought from the client.

===Disclosure compelled by law===
Where expressly provided for in statute, lawyers must comply with any parliamentary requirement necessitating breach of the duty to confidentiality. [[Tom Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] in ''Parry-Jones v Law Society''&lt;ref&gt;''Parry-Jones v Law Society'' [1969] 1 Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; said at 6-7:

:"the solicitor must obey the law, and, in particular, he must comply with the rules made under the authority of statute for the conduct of the profession. If the rules require him to disclose his client's affairs, then he must do so."

Statutory abrogation of the duty is limited in scope and purpose however. Requirements are never blanket decrees for the revelation of confidential information. Rather they are based on upholding the public interest, where such interests override client interests in maintaining confidentiality.

===Disclosure ostensibly to support lawyer's own interests===
Lawyers may disclose confidential information relating to the retainer where they are reasonably seeking to collect payment for services rendered. This is justified on policy grounds. If lawyers were unable to disclose such information, many would undertake legal work only where payment is made in advance. This would arguably adversely affect the public's access to justice.

Lawyers may also breach the duty where they are defending themselves against disciplinary or legal proceedings. A client who initiates  proceedings against a lawyer effectively waives rights to confidentiality. This is justified on grounds of procedural fairness - a lawyer unable to reveal information relating to the retainer would be unable to defend themselves against such actions.

===Disclosure of information that is not confidential===
Clearly, information that is not confidential does not fall under the duty of confidentiality. Disclosure of information that is already in the public domain does not breach the duty. Further, information that was not in the public knowledge at the time of the retainer agreement, is not subject to the duty if it subsequently enters the public domain. The purpose served by maintaining the confidence - the protection of the client - is arguably extinguished.

Nonetheless, the lawyer still owes a duty of loyalty, and clients may feel betrayed if such information is disclosed, even if it becomes public knowledge. Though there are no legal ramifications for disclosure, discretion on part of the lawyer may be in the long term interests of maintaining the propriety of the legal profession.

===Disclosure for the purpose of probate===
{{seealso|Probate court|Surrogate's court}}
Another case is for the [[probate]] of a [[last will and testament]].  Previously confidential communications between the lawyer and [[testator]] are no longer secret for the purpose of proving the Will is the intent of the now deceased [[decedent]].  In many instances, the will, [[codicil (will)|codicil]], or other parts of the [[Estate planning|estate plan]] require explanation or interpretation through other proof (extrinsic evidence), such as the attorney's file notes or correspondence from the client.

In certain cases, the client may desire or consent to revelation of personal or family secrets only after his or her death; for example, the Will may leave a [[legacy (property law)|legacy]] to a [[paramour]] or a [[natural child]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">'''Ecological imperialism''' is the theory advanced first by Alfred Crosby that European settlers were successful in colonization of other regions because of their accidental or deliberate introduction of animals, plants, and disease leading to major shifts in the ecology of the colonized areas and to population collapses in the endemic peoples. The many [[pathogen]]s they carried with them adversely affected the [[native populations]] of North America, Australia, and Africa, and were far more destructive than weaponry: it is estimated that disease wiped out up to 90 percent of indigenous people in some locations.&lt;ref&gt;D. N. Cook, Demographic Collapse: Indian Peru 1520-1620 (Cambridge, 1981), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Cortes and the Aztecs==
In the early 16th century, Spanish conquistador [[Hernán Cortés]] led an expedition to what is now Mexico, which resulted in the total destruction of the [[Aztec Empire]] within just two years (February 1519 – August 1521). Notwithstanding the Europeans' superior weaponry and [[Horses]], it is believed {{by who?|date=December 2016}} that the arrival of [[smallpox]] in the Americas in 1520 weakened the resistance the Aztecs people were able to mount.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

=="The New World"==
In 1607, English settlers arrived in North America and established the [[Jamestown colony]] in Virginia. Though at first it seemed the colonists would not survive the harsh conditions of the [[New World]], ultimately it was the natives who could not survive the diseases of the Old World. "The colonizers brought along plants and animals new to the Americas, some by design and others by accident. Determined to farm in a European manner, the colonists introduced their domesticated livestock—honeybees, pigs, horses, mules, sheep, and cattle—and their domesticated plants, including wheat, barley, rye, oats, grasses, and grapevines. But the colonists also inadvertently carried pathogens, weeds, and rats."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Taylor, American Colonies (Penguin Books: 2002), 280-300.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of these foreign species upset the balance of native species and severely hurt the way of life of the native population. 

The first major smallpox outbreak among natives was between 1616 and 1619 in Massachusetts. Native Americans had never seen a disease like this, and it wiped out entire settlements in nations such as the [[Abenaki]], the [[Pawtucket tribe|Pawtucket]], and the [[Wampanoag]]. "By wiping out the Indians, smallpox helped the colonists help themselves to land and resources formerly controlled by unfriendly native people. The Europeans could and did colonize virtually unchallenged in some areas." In 1633 there was another devastating epidemic. William Bradford, governor of the Plymouth Colony, observed that: "They lye on their hard matts, ye pox breaking and muttering, and running one into another, their skin cleaving (by reason thereof) to the matts they lye on; when they turn them, a whole side with flea off at once...and they will be all of a gore blood, most fearful to behold. Then being very sore, what with cold and other distempers, they dye like rotten sheep."&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie True Peters, Epidemic! Smallpox in the New World (Benchmark Books, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Syphilis was also extremely devastating, and ran rampant when brought back to the Old World.

==Fur trade==
The fur trade was as detrimental to the survival of native people as it was imperative to the success of settlers due the high European demand. Trappers employed natives because of their knowledge of the terrain and wildlife, putting natives with no immunity to European diseases into close contact with Europeans.

The fur trade also upset the ecological balance of North America. "Restraint wasn't a hallmark of the fur trade. In 1822, in the north western regions of the country alone, the Hudson's Bay Company stockpiled 1500 fox skins, a paltry number compared with the 106,000 beaver skins, but too many none the less. The fur traders had miscalculated. As predators, they had failed to adapt to their prey, and their prey, in turn, retaliated with denial. Of course, the red fox didn't render himself extinct. His numbers merely shrank.".&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Kirsch, What Species of Creatures (New Star Books: 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ergodic hypothesis w reflecting rays.jpg|thumb|The question of ergodicity in a perfectly collisionless [[ideal gas]] with [[specular reflection]]s.]]
[[Image:Fruit fly trap.jpg|150px|thumb|This device can trap fruit flies, but if it trapped atoms when placed in gas that already uniformly fills the available [[phase space]], then both [[Liouville's_theorem_(Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] and the [[Perpetual_motion#Classification|second law of thermodynamics]] would be violated.]]
In [[physics]] and [[thermodynamics]], the '''ergodic hypothesis'''&lt;ref&gt;Originally due to L. Boltzmann. See part 2 of {{cite book|title=Vorlesungen über Gastheorie|year= 1898 |location=Leipzig|publisher=J. A. Barth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99IEAAAAYAAJ |oclc=01712811}} ('Ergoden' on p.89 in the 1923 reprint.) It was used to prove equipartition of energy in the kinetic theory of gases&lt;/ref&gt; says that, over long periods of time, the time spent by a system in some region of the [[phase space]] of [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] with the same energy is proportional to the volume of this region, i.e., that all accessible microstates are [[equiprobable]] over a long period of time.

[[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's Theorem]] states that, for [[Hamiltonian dynamics|Hamiltonian]] systems, the local density of microstates following a particle path through phase space is constant as viewed by an observer moving with the ensemble (i.e., the [[Material derivative|convective time derivative]] is zero). Thus, if the microstates are [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] in [[phase space]] initially, they will remain so at all times. But Liouville's theorem does ''not'' imply that the ergodic hypothesis holds for all Hamiltonian systems.

The ergodic hypothesis is often assumed in the [[statistical analysis]] of [[computational physics]]. The analyst would assume that the [[average]] of a process parameter over [[time]] and the average over the [[statistical ensemble]] are the same. This assumption that it is as good to simulate a system over a long time as it is to make many independent realizations of the same system is not always correct. (See, for example, the [[Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem|Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou experiment]] of 1953.)

Assumption of the ergodic hypothesis allows proof that certain types of perpetual motion machines of the [[Perpetual motion#Classification|second kind]] are impossible.  The figure above displays situations where the ergodic hypothesis does and does not hold for a simplistic model of an ideal gas.  If the walls are perfectly smooth and circular, the ergodic hypothesis does ''not'' hold.  If it was possible to construct a sort of ''tunnel'' whereby [[specular reflection]]s cause atoms to move from a less populated container to an identical one with greater density, this would allow the direct conversion of random [[thermal energy]] into useful [[Work (physics)|work]] in a way that does not require a [[heat engine|heat bath]].  But, by Liouville's theorem, if all regions of phase space are equally populated at time, t=0, then they are equally probable for all time.  No reflective 'trap' or [[Maxwell's demon]] (such as depicted in the figure) will 'unmix' a gas that has randomly filled both containers with equal density and pressure.

==Phenomenology==
In macroscopic systems, the timescales over which a system can truly explore the entirety of its own [[phase space]] can be sufficiently large that the thermodynamic equilibrium state exhibits some form of '''ergodicity breaking'''. A common example is that of spontaneous magnetisation in [[ferromagnetic]] systems, whereby below the [[Curie temperature]] the system preferentially adopts a non-zero magnetisation even though the ergodic hypothesis would imply that no net magnetisation should exist by virtue of the system exploring all states whose time-averaged magnetisation should be zero. The fact that macroscopic systems often violate the literal form of the ergodic hypothesis is an example of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]].

However, complex disordered systems such as a [[spin glass]] show an even more complicated form of ergodicity breaking where the properties of the thermodynamic equilibrium state seen in practice are much more difficult to predict purely by symmetry arguments. Also conventional glasses (e.g. window glasses) violate ergodicity in a complicated manner. In practice this means that on sufficiently short time scales (e.g. those of parts of seconds, minutes, or a few hours) the systems may behave as ''solids'', i.e. with a positive shear modulus, but on extremely long scales, e.g. over millennia or eons, as ''liquids'', or with two or more time scales and ''plateaux''  in between.&lt;ref&gt;The introduction of the practical aspect of ergodicity breaking by introducing a "non-ergodicity time scale" is due to {{cite journal|first= R. G. |last=Palmer |title=Broken ergodicity |journal= Advances in Physics |volume =31|issue=6 |page= 669 |year=1982|bibcode = 1982AdPhy..31..669P |doi = 10.1080/00018738200101438 }}. Also related to these time-scale phenomena are the properties of [[ageing]] and the Mode-Coupling theory of {{cite book|first=W.|last= Götze|title=Dynamics of Glass Forming Liquids|publisher= Oxford Univ. Press|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==
[[Ergodic theory]] is a branch of [[mathematics]] which deals with [[dynamical system]]s that satisfy a version of this hypothesis, phrased in the language of [[measure theory]].

{{Conservatism US}}
'''Family values''', sometimes referred to as '''familial values''', are [[tradition]]al or cultural [[values]] that pertain to the [[family]]'s structure, function, roles, beliefs, attitudes, and ideals.

In the social sciences and U.S. political discourse, the term "[[traditional family]]" refers to a nuclear family − a child-rearing environment composed of a [[breadwinner|breadwinning]] [[father]], a [[homemaking]] [[mother]], and their biological [[children]]; sociologists formerly referred to this model as the [[Social norm|norm]].{{fact|date=May 2018}} A family deviating from this model is considered a [[Non-traditional family|nontraditional family]].  However, in most cultures at most times, the [[extended family]] model has been most common, not the nuclear family,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2018/05/13/610777733/parenting-myths-and-facts Parenting Myths And Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; and the nuclear family became the most common form in the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bebusinessed.com/history/history-nuclear-families/ History of Nuclear Families]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Several well-known online dictionaries define "family values" as the following:
* "the [[morality|moral]] and [[ethics|ethical]] principles traditionally upheld and passed on within a family, as honesty, loyalty, industry, and faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=family values|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/family+values|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "values especially of a traditional or [[Conservatism|conservative]] kind which are held to promote the sound functioning of the family and to strengthen the fabric of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=family values|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/family%20values|website=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "values held to be traditionally taught or reinforced within a family, such as those of high moral standards and discipline."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=family values|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/family-values|website=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
{{Main|Familialism}}
[[Familialism]] or ''familism'' is the [[ideology]] that puts priority on [[family]] and family values.&lt;ref name=Ochiai&gt;{{cite book|title=Transformation of the Intimate and the Public in Asian Modernity. The Intimate and the Public in Asian and Global Perspectives|author=Emiko Ochiai, Leo Aoi Hosoya|publisher=BRILL|year=2014|isbn=9789004264359}} [url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JImIBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20 Page 20-21]&lt;/ref&gt; Familialism prioritizes the needs of the family over the needs of individuals, and advocates for a welfare system where families, rather than the [[government]], take responsibility for the care of their members.&lt;ref name=Ochiai/&gt;

In the United States, the banner of "family values" has been used by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] to fight [[abortion]], [[LGBT rights|gay rights]], and major [[Feminism|feminist]] objectives in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dowland|first1=Seth|title=Family Values and the Rise of the Christian Right|date=2015|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9780812247602|url=to fight abortion, gay rights, and major feminist objectives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==
{{missing information|other cultures|date=November 2016}}

===Saudi culture===
Interpretations of [[Islam]]ic learnings and [[Arab culture]] are common for the majority of [[Saudi]]s. [[Islam]] is a driving cultural force that dictates a submission to the will of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peachy|first1=William S.|title=A brief look upon Islam|date=1999|publisher=Darussalam Publishers and Distributors|location=Riyadh, Saudi Arabia|pages=48|url=https://www.amazon.com/A-Brief-Look-Upon-Islam/dp/B00135EA0W|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic literature suggests that the family is regarded as the main foundation of Muslim society and culture; the family structure and nature of the relationship between family members are influenced by the Islamic religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mutair, A|author2=Plummer, V|author3=O'Brien, A|author4= Clerehan, R|authorlink1=Providing culturally congruent care for Saudi patients and their families|journal=Contemporary Nurse: A Journal For The Australian Nursing Profession|date=2014|volume=46|issue=2|pages=254–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage in Saudi culture means the union of two families, not just two individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Khalaf, I|author2=Callister, L|title=Cultural meanings of childbirth: Muslim women living in Jordan|journal=Journal of Holistic Nursing|date=1997|volume=4|issue=15|pages=373–388}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim society, marriage involves a social contract that occurs with the consent of [[parent]]s or guardians. Furthermore, marriage is considered the only legitimate outlet for [[sexual desire]]s, and sex outside marriage ([[fornication]]) is a crime that is punished under Islamic law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1= Lemu, A|author2=Heeren, F|title=Women in Islam|date=1992|publisher=The Islamic Foundation|location=Leicester, England|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of marriage is similar to the [[Western world|Western]] [[Christian]] view of marriage, created in 12th century [[France]], which promised [[salvation]], sex without sin, and much more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McDougall|first1= Sara|title= The Making of Marriage in Medieval France|journal=Journal of Family History|date= 2013|volume= 38|issue=2|pages= 103–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saudi family includes extended families, as the [[extended family]] provides the individual with a sense of [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. The father is often the [[:wikt:breadwinner|breadwinner]] and protector of the family, whereas the mother is often the [[homemaker]] and the primary caretaker of the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Luna|first1=J|title= Transcultural nursing care of Arab Muslims|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=1989|volume=1|issue=1|pages=22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents are regarded with high respect, and children are strongly encouraged to respect and obey their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ghazwi, F.|author2= Nock, L.|authorlink1= Religion as mediating force in the effects of modernization on parent–child relations in Jordan|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=1989|volume=25|pages= 363–369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, families provide care for elders. Until recently, because families and friends are expected to provide [[elderly care]], [[nursing home]]s were considered culturally unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luna|first1= J|title=Transcultural nursing care of Arab Muslims|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=1989|volume=1 |issue= 1|pages= 22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States culture===
In sociological terms, nontraditional families make up the majority of American households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Panasenko, N|title=Czech and Slovak Family Patterns and Family Values in Historical, Social and Cultural Context|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|date=2013|volume=44|issue=1|pages=79–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, only 46% of children in the U.S. live in a traditional family, down from 61% in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/22/less-than-half-of-u-s-kids-today-live-in-a-traditional-family/&lt;/ref&gt; This number includes only families with parents who are in their first marriage, whereas the percentage of children simply living with two married parents is 65% as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/cb16-192.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many who hold that the nuclear family is the fabric that holds society together&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bruderhof.com/en/our-faith/foundations/church-actions/marriage|title=Marriage|website=Bruderhof|language=en|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and work to promote stronger family values. The [[Chemin Neuf Community|Chemin Neuf]] community, the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/life-among-the-bruderhof/|title=Life Among The Bruderhof|work=The American Conservative|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Evangelical Alliance]] all work to promote the nuclear family.

{{redirect|Bona fide|other uses|Bona fide (disambiguation)|and|Good faith (disambiguation)}}
'''Good faith''' ({{lang-la|bona fides}}), in human interactions, is a sincere intention to be fair, open, and honest, regardless of the outcome of the interaction. While some Latin phrases lose their literal meaning over centuries, this is not the case with ''bona fides''; it is still widely used and interchangeable with its generally accepted modern-day English translation of ''good faith''.&lt;ref&gt;Garger, John. "Translating Arguendo and Bona Fide from Latin to English." ''Bright Hub Education''. Bright Hub Inc., 5 Jan 2012. Retrieved 6 Feb 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important concept within [[law]] and [[business]]. The opposed concepts are [[bad faith]], ''mala fides'' (duplicity) and [[perfidy]] (pretense). In contemporary English, the usage of ''bona fides'' is synonymous with [[credential]]s and [[identity document|identity]]. The phrase is sometimes used in job advertisements, and should not be confused with the [[bona fide occupational qualifications|''bona fide'' occupational qualifications]] or the employer's good faith effort, as described below.

==''Bona fides''==
''Bona fides'' is a Latin phrase meaning "good faith". Its [[Ablative (Latin)|ablative case]] is ''bona fide'', meaning "in good faith", it is often used as an adjective to mean "genuine". While today ''fides'' is concomitant to faith, a more technical translation of the Latin concept would be something like "reliability", in the sense of a trust between two parties for the potentiality of a relationship. In [[ancient Rome]] ''bona fides'' was always assumed by both sides, had implied responsibilities, and both legal and religious consequences if broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams |first=John P.|title=THE ROMAN CONCEPT OF FIDES|website= sun.edu|date= May 2009|url=http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/fides.html|accessdate= &lt;!-- January 2015 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fides (deity)|Fides]] was one of the original virtues to be considered a religious "divinity" in [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman paganism]].

==Law==
{{main article|Good faith (law)}}
In [[law]], ''bona fides'' denotes the [[:wikt:mental state|mental]] and [[morality|moral]] states of honesty and [[belief|conviction]] regarding either the [[truth]] or the [[falsity]] of a [[proposition]], or of a body of [[opinion]]; likewise regarding either the rectitude or the depravity of a line of [[Action (philosophy)|conduct]]. As a legal concept ''bona fides'' is especially important in matters of [[Equity (law)|equity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03|url=http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=819&amp;bold=|title=good faith |publisher=Law.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Good Faith as an international principle of law [http://www.trans-lex.org/901000 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''bona fide'' is also proclaimed by the original version of the [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Magna Carta]] (1215), Clause I&lt;/ref&gt; In contract law, the implied covenant of good faith is a general presumption that the parties to a contract will deal with each other honestly and fairly, so as not to destroy the right of the other party or parties to receive the benefits of the contract. In insurance law, the insurer's breach of the implied covenant may give rise to a legal liability known as [[insurance bad faith]].

Most US jurisdictions view breaches of implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing solely as a variant of breach of [[contract]]. Linguistically, in the US, American English usage of ''bona fides'' applies it as synonymous with [[credential]]s, professional background, and documents attesting a person's [[identity document|identity]], which is not synonymous with [[bona fide occupational qualifications|''bona fide'' occupational qualifications]]. More recently, other common law countries have begun to adopt good faith as a general principle. In the UK, the High Court in ''[[Yam Seng Pte Ltd v Int Trade Corp Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2013] EWHC 111&lt;/ref&gt; expressed this preference. In Canada, the Supreme Court declared in ''[[Bhasin v. Hrynew]]'' that good faith was a general organizing principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14438/index.do |title=SCC 71|year=2014|website=scc-csc.lexum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment efforts==
[[Bona fide occupational qualifications|''Bona fide'' occupational qualifications]] (employer's good faith effort) are qualities or attributes that employers are allowed to consider when making decisions on the hiring and retaining of employees. An employer's good faith effort is used as an evaluation tool by the jurisdiction during the annual program review process to determine an employer's level of commitment to the reduction goals of the [[Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction|CTR Law]]. [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal]] and [[State governments of the United States|state government]]s are required by [[Affirmative action#United States|affirmative action]] (and other such laws) to look for disabled, minority, female, and veteran business enterprises when bidding public jobs. Good faith effort law varies from state to state and even within states depending on the awarding department of the government. Most good faith effort requires advertising in state certified publications, usually a trade and a focus publication. Other countries such as Canada have similar programs.

==In wikis==
Public [[wiki]]s depend on implicitly or explicitly assuming that its users are acting in good faith. [[Wikipedia]]'s principle ''Assume Good Faith'' (often abbreviated AGF) has been a stated guideline since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"Wikipedia:Assume good faith." Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. 13 May 2005, 20:361 UTC. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith&amp;oldid=14428829 Wikipedia:Assume good faith]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "the first principle in the Wikipedia etiquette".&lt;ref&gt;Goldspink, Chris (2007), "[http://isce.edu/ISCE_Group_Site/web-content/ISCE_Events/Auckland_2007/Papers/Regular/032_Goldspink.pdf Normative self-regulation in the emergence of global network institutions: The Case of Wikipedia]", ''Proceedings of the 13th ANZSYS Conference'' - Auckland, New Zealand, 2-5 December 2007; Systemic Development: Local Solutions in a Global Environment&lt;/ref&gt; According to one study of users' motives for contributing to Wikipedia, "while participants have both individualistic and collaborative motives, collaborative ([[Altruism|altruistic]]) motives dominate."&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, C., Prasarnphanich, P. (2007) "Innovating collaborative content creation: the role of altruism and wiki technology",  ''Proceedings of 40th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences'', 3-6 January 2007, Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2803">'''Gravitaxis''' is a form of [[taxis]] characterized by the directional movement of an organism in response to gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Gravitaxis|accessdate=25 March 2018|title=Gravitaxis - Biology-Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gravitaxis is one of the many forms of taxis. It is characterized by the movement of an organism in response to gravitational forces. It is sometimes called geotaxis.&lt;ref name="King Crab"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=C. F.|last2=Paul|first2=A. J.|title=Phototaxis and Geotaxis of Light-Adapted Zoeae of the Golden King Crab Lithodes aequispinus (Anomura: Lithodidae) in the Laboratory|journal=Journal of Crustacean Biology|date=February 1999|volume=19|issue=1|pages=106|doi=10.2307/1549552|jstor=1549552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravitaxis is different from [[gravitropism]] in a way that the latter is more about the growth response of an organism to gravity.

==Taxis==
{{main|Taxis}}
Taxis is a behavioral response of a cell or an organism to an external stimulus. The movement is characteristically directional. The movement may be positive or negative. A positive taxis is one in which the organism or a cell moves towards the source of stimulation (attraction). A negative taxis is when the organism or a cell moves away from the source of stimulation (repulsion).

[[File:Coudée-turin detail.jpg|thumb|250px|Detail of a [[cubit]] rod in the [[Museo Egizio]] of [[Turin]]]]
The earliest recorded systems of weights and measures originate in the 3rd or 4th millennium BC. Even the very earliest civilizations needed measurement for purposes of agriculture, construction, and trade. Early standard units might only have applied to a single community or small region, with every area developing its own standards for lengths, areas, volumes and masses. Often such systems were closely tied to one field of use, so that volume measures used, for example, for dry grains were unrelated to those for liquids, with neither bearing any particular relationship to units of length used for measuring cloth or land. With development of manufacturing technologies, and the growing importance of trade between communities and ultimately across the Earth, standardized weights and measures became critical. Starting in the 18th century, modernized, simplified and uniform systems of weights and measures were developed, with the fundamental units defined by ever more precise methods in the science of [[metrology]]. The discovery and application of [[electricity]] was one factor motivating the development of standardized internationally applicable units. 

==Sources of information==

[[Weights and measures]] have taken a great variety of forms over the course of history, from simple informal expectations in barter transactions to elaborate state and supranational systems that integrate measures of many different kinds.  Weights and measures from the oldest societies can often be inferred at least in part from [[archaeology|archaeological specimens]], often preserved in museums.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The comparison of the dimensions of buildings with the descriptions of contemporary writers is another source of information. An interesting example of this is the comparison of the dimensions of the Greek [[Parthenon]] with the description given by [[Plutarch]] from which a fairly accurate idea of the size of the [[Ancient Greek units of measurement#Length|Attic foot]] is obtained. Because of the comparative volume of artifacts and documentation, we know much more about the state-sanctioned measures of large, advanced societies than we do about those of smaller societies or about the informal measures that often coexisted with official ones throughout history. In some cases, we have only plausible theories and we must sometimes select the interpretation to be given to the evidence.

By studying the evidence given by all available sources, and by correlating the relevant facts, we obtain some idea of the origin and development of the units. We find that they have changed more or less gradually with the passing of time in a complex manner because of a great variety of modifying influences.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} It is possible to group official measurement systems for large societies into historical systems that are relatively stable over time, including: the Babylonian system, the Egyptian system, the Phileterian system of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] age, the Olympic system of Greece, the Roman system, the [[English unit|British system]], and the [[metric system]].

==Earliest known systems==
The earliest known uniform systems of weights and measures seem all to have been created at some time in the [[4th millennium BC|4th]] and [[3rd millennium BC|3rd millennia BC]] among the ancient peoples of [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus Valley]], and perhaps also [[Elam]] (in [[Iran]]) as well.

Early [[Babylonia]]n and [[History of Egypt|Egyptian]] records and the [[Hebrew Bible]] indicate that length was first measured with the forearm, hand, or finger and that time was measured by the periods of the sun, moon, and other heavenly bodies. When it was necessary to compare the capacities of containers such as [[gourd]]s or [[clay]] or metal vessels, they were filled with plant seeds which were then counted to measure the [[volume]]s. When means for weighing were invented, seeds and stones served as standards. For instance, the [[Carat (unit)|carat]], still used as a unit for gems, was derived from the [[carob]] seed.

==History of units==
{{main|Historical metrology}}

=== Units of length ===
The Egyptian [[cubit]], the [[Indus Valley]] units of length referred to above and the Mesopotamian cubit were used in the 3rd millennium BC and are the earliest known units used by ancient peoples to measure length. The units of length used in ancient India included the dhanus, or dhanush (bow), the krosa (cry, or cow-call) and the [[yojana]] (stage).

The common cubit was the length of the forearm from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. It was divided into the span of the hand or the length between the tip of little finger to the tip of the thumb (one-half cubit), the palm or width of the hand (one sixth), and the digit or width of the middle finger (one twenty-fourth).  The Royal Cubit, which was a standard cubit enhanced by an extra palm—thus 7 palms or 28 digits long—was used in constructing buildings and monuments and in surveying in ancient Egypt.  The [[inch]], [[foot (length)|foot]], and [[yard]] evolved from these units through a complicated transformation not yet fully understood. Some believe they evolved from cubic measures; others believe they were simple proportions or multiples of the cubit. In whichever case, the Greeks and Romans inherited the foot from the Egyptians. The Roman foot (~296&amp;nbsp;mm) was divided into both 12 ''unciae'' (inches) (~24.7&amp;nbsp;mm) and 16 digits (~18.5&amp;nbsp;mm). The Romans also introduced the ''mille passus'' (1000 paces) or double steps, the pace being equal to five Roman feet (~1480&amp;nbsp;mm). The Roman [[mile]] of 5000 feet (1480 m) was introduced into England during the occupation. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] (reigned from 1558 to 1603) changed, by statute, the mile to 5280 feet (~1609 m) or 8 furlongs, a [[furlong]] being 40 [[rod (unit)]]s (~201 m) of 5.5 yards (~5.03 m) each.

The introduction of the yard (0.9144 m) as a unit of length came later, but its origin is not definitely known. Some believe the origin was the double cubit, others believe that it originated from cubic measure. Whatever its origin, the early yard was divided by the binary method into 2, 4, 8, and 16 parts called the half-yard, span, finger, and nail. The association of the yard with the "gird" or circumference of a person's waist or with the distance from the tip of the nose to the end of the thumb of [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (reigned 1100–1135) are probably standardizing actions, since several yards were in use in Britain.
There were also Rods, Poles and Perches for measurements of length. The following table lists the equivalents.

=== Units of mass ===
The [[Grain (mass)|grain]] was the earliest [[Mass#Units of mass|unit of mass]] and is the smallest unit in the [[Apothecarie' system of mass|apothecary]], [[avoirdupois]], Tower, and [[Troy weight|troy]] systems. The early unit was a grain of wheat or barleycorn used to weigh the precious metals silver and gold. Larger units preserved in stone standards were developed that were used as both units of mass and of monetary currency. The [[Pound (mass)|pound]] was derived from the mina used by ancient civilizations.  A smaller unit was the shekel, and a larger unit was the [[talent (measurement)|talent]]. The magnitude of these units varied from place to place. The Babylonians and Sumerians had a system in which there were 60 shekels in a mina and 60 minas in a talent. The Roman talent consisted of 100 libra (pound) which were smaller in magnitude than the mina. The troy pound (~373.2 g) used in England and the United States for monetary purposes, like the Roman pound, was divided into 12 ounces, but the Roman uncia (ounce) was smaller. The carat is a unit for measuring gemstones that had its origin in the carob seed, which later was standardized at 1/144 ounce and then 0.2&amp;nbsp;gram. 

Goods of commerce were originally traded by number or volume.  When weighing of goods began, units of mass based on a volume of grain or water were developed. The diverse magnitudes of units having the same name, which still appear today in our dry and liquid measures, could have arisen from the various commodities traded.  The larger avoirdupois pound for goods of commerce might have been based on volume of water which has a higher [[bulk density]] than grain.

The stone, quarter, hundredweight, and ton were larger units of mass used in Britain.  Today only the stone continues in customary use for measuring personal body weight.  The present stone is 14 pounds (~6.35&amp;nbsp;kg), but an earlier unit appears to have been 16 pounds (~7.25&amp;nbsp;kg).  The other units were multiples of 2, 8, and 160 times the stone, or 28, 112, and 2240 pounds (~12.7&amp;nbsp;kg, 50.8&amp;nbsp;kg, 1016&amp;nbsp;kg), respectively.  The hundredweight was approximately equal to two talents.  The ton of 2240 pounds is called the "long ton".  The "short ton" is equal to 2000 pounds (~907&amp;nbsp;kg).  A tonne (t) is equal to 1000&amp;nbsp;kg.

=== Units of time and angle ===
The division of the circle into 360 degrees and the day into hours, minutes, and seconds can be traced to the Babylonians who had [[sexagesimal]] system of numbers.  The 360 degrees may have been related to a [[360-day calendar|year of 360 days]].  Many other [[systems of measurement]] divided the day differently -- [[Hour#Counting hours|counting hours]], [[decimal time]], etc. Other [[calendar]]s divided the year differently.

== Forerunners of the metric system ==
Decimal numbers are an essential part of the metric system, with only one base unit and multiples created on the decimal base, the figures remain the same. This simplifies calculations. Although the [[India|Indians]] used decimal numbers for mathematical computations, it was [[Simon Stevin]] who in 1585 first advocated the use of decimal numbers for everyday purposes in his booklet ''De Thiende'' (old Dutch for 'the tenth').  He also declared that it would only be a matter of time before decimal numbers were used for currencies and measurements. [[Simon Stevin#Decimal fractions|His notation]] for decimal fractions was clumsy, but this was overcome with the introduction of the decimal point, generally attributed to [[Bartholomaeus Pitiscus]] who used this notation in his trigonometrical tables (1595).&lt;ref name="Stevin_MacTutor2"&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Stevin|date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|''Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language'']], published in 1668, [[John Wilkins]] proposed a system of measurement that was very similar in concept to today's metric system.  He proposed retaining the second as the basic unit of time and proposed that the length of a pendulum which crossed the zero position once a second (i.e. had a period of two seconds) should be the base unit of length.  This length, for which he proposed the name "standard", would have been 994&amp;nbsp;mm.  His base unit of mass, which he proposed calling a "hundred", would have been the mass of a cubic standard of distilled rainwater.  The names that he proposed for decimal multiples and subunits of his base units of measure were the names of units of measure that were in use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduction (33&amp;nbsp;MB):{{cite book|url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationLong.pdf|title=An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|author=[[John Wilkins]]|publisher=The Royal Society|year=1668|pages=190–194|chapter=VII|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationShort.pdf|title=An ESSAY Towards a REAL CHARACTER, And a PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE|publisher=Metricationmatters.com|format=PDF|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1670, [[Gabriel Mouton]] published a proposal that was in essence similar to Wilkins' proposal, except that his base unit of length would have been 1/1000 of a [[minute of arc]] (about 1.852&amp;nbsp;m) of geographical latitude.  He proposed calling this unit the virga.  Rather than using different names for each unit of length, he proposed a series of names that had prefixes, rather like the prefixes found in SI.&lt;ref name="Mouton2"&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Mouton|date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, [[Thomas Jefferson]] submitted a [[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States|report]] to the [[United States Congress]] in which he proposed the adoption of a decimal system of coinage and of weights and measures.  He proposed calling his base unit of length a "foot" which he suggested should be either {{frac|3|10}} or {{frac|1|3}} of the length of a pendulum that had a period of one second – that is {{frac|3|10}} or {{frac|1|3}} of the "standard" proposed by Wilkins over a century previously.  This would have equated to 11.755 English inches (29.8&amp;nbsp;cm) or 13.06 English inches (33.1&amp;nbsp;cm). Like Wilkins, the names that he proposed for multiples and subunits of his base units of measure were the names of units of measure that were in use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/jeffplan.asp|title=Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States Communicated to the House of Representatives, July 13, 1790|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|date=4 July 1790|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great interest in [[geodesy]] during this era, and the measurement system ideas that developed, influenced how the continental US was [[Surveying|surveyed]] and parceled. The story of how Jefferson's full vision for the new measurement system came close to displacing the [[Chain (unit)|Gunter chain]] and the traditional [[acre]], but ended up not doing so, is explored in [[Andro Linklater]]'s ''Measuring America''.&lt;ref name="Linklater_20022"&gt;{{cite book|title=Measuring America: How an Untamed Wilderness Shaped the United States and Fulfilled the Promise of Democracy|last=Linklater|first=Andro|publisher=Walker &amp; Co|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8027-1396-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metric conversion ==
{{Main article|Metrication|History of the metric system}}
The [[metric system]] was first described in 1668 and officially adopted by France in 1799.  Over nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it became the dominant system worldwide, although several countries, including the United States and China, continue to use their customary units. Among the numerous customary systems, many have been adapted to become an integer multiple of a related metric unit: The [[Scandinavian mile]] is now defined as 10&amp;nbsp;km, the [[Chinese jin]] is now defined as 0.5&amp;nbsp;kg, and the [[Dutch units of measurement|Dutch ons]] is now defined as 100&amp;nbsp;g. The [[US customary units|American system]] is unusual in that its units have not been adapted in such a manner.

{{distinguish|Ineffability}}

'''Infallibility''' is the inability to be wrong. Its importance and meaning is debated in [[epistemology]] and major religions.

==In philosophy==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
[[Epistemology]], a branch of [[philosophy]], is concerned with the question of what, if anything, humans can know. The answer to the issue of whether or not a human can be infallible depends on the philosophical school.

*Advocates of [[philosophical skepticism]] claim that one cannot know anything with certainty, much less be infallible. [[fallibilism|Fallibilists]] hold a similar position, but claim that what is true today could be wrong tomorrow.{{Dubious|date=September 2011}}
*Advocates of [[subjectivism]] claim that there is no objective reality or truth, and therefore anyone can be considered infallible, since whatever is within a person's consciousness ''is'' considered the real and the true.
*Advocates of [[reason]] and [[rationality]] claim that one ''can'' gain certainty of knowledge, through a process of extreme refinement measures unlikely to be perfected enough for someone to assurably say "certainty of this knowledge is absolute", yet also assume by chance that one could land on the objective without the knowledge being confidently described as "universally certain", thus as a result, advocates tend to avoid this altogether and instead rely upon [[Occam's Razor]] as a suitable means for obtaining knowledge.

==In theology==
===Christianity===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
{{See also|Biblical infallibility|Biblical inerrancy|Infallibility of the Church|Papal infallibility}}
Human involvement in the revelatory process is very important because God has no choice but to communicate in human language through human agents. But if this must be so, God can at least be expected to prevent human weakness and shortcoming from marring this divine process. If our sources of knowledge are not infallible, then who is going to decide what to accept and what to reject? &lt;ref&gt;Daniel,W.Brown, "Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought", p61. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1999. {{ISBN|0521653940}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' defines infallibility as "Inability to err in teaching revealed truth".&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F.L. and Livingstone, E.A. (eds), "infallibility" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', p831. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-211655-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Church theology claim that the [[Christian Church|Church]] is infallible, but disagree as to where infallibility exists, whether in doctrines, scripture, or church authorities.

In contrast, Protestant and non-denominational Christian churches believe that the Christian Church is indeed fallible—as evidenced by the requirement of Christ's sacrifice on the cross to pay for the sins of the world, including those of his Church—and that only God's word in Scripture is infallible. They also completely reject the Roman Catholic claim regarding Papal Infallibility, citing not just scriptural reasons, but also the many times popes have contradicted each other and the history of mistakes committed by many popes throughout Roman Catholic Church history. 

Because of the complexity in defining infallibility, some Protestant and non-denominational views confuse infallibility and [[impeccability]], as if the Pope were immune from sin, but that is not the Roman Catholic Church's doctrine. In [[Roman Catholic]] theology, only the actual act of teaching may properly be called "infallible". According to the [[First Vatican Council]] (1869–71) and as reaffirmed at [[Vatican II]] (1962–1965) the Pope is infallible when speaking ''[[ex cathedra]]'' on matters of faith and morals. Thus the Pope may sin in his private life, but he is infallible while on the clock.

===Judaism===
The notion of infallibility in Judaism as it relates to the [[Tannaim]] and [[Amoraim]] of the [[Talmud]], as well as the [[Rishonim]], [[Achronim]] and modern day [[Gedolim]] is one surrounded by debate.

Some who reject infallibility cite the Talmud, [[Pesachim]] 94b:

{{quote|The sages of Israel say: "The sphere ([[Earth]]) remains fixed and the [[constellations]] revolve," while the sages of the nations say: "The sphere revolves and the constellations remain fixed."...the sages of Israel say: "during the day the [[sun]] moves below the canopy (sky) and at night above the canopy," while the sages of the nations say: "during the day the sun moves below the canopy and at night below the ground."  Rebbi said: "Their words seem more correct than ours..."}}

The words of the [[Mishna]] are commented on by numerous commentators, and Yehuda Levi argues that evidence mounts that the [[Geonim]] and the [[Rambam]] perceived that the sages of the Talmud "erred in a matter of [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Levi, Yehuda, ''The Science in Torah'', Feldheim Publishers 2004, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rambam wrote that the great sages are not expected to advocate positions perfectly in-line with modern science because they were "scholars of that generation," often basing their assessments of what "they learned from the scholars of the era."&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonidies]], ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' part 3, chapter 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hasidism|Hassidic]] tradition, however, infallibility is taught in the [[Chabad]] tradition in connection with a [[Rebbe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tzaddikim.blogspot.com/search/label/infallibility Sources about infallibility of Tzaddikim]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
====Universal teachings====
[[Islam]] teaches that the teachings and guidance by the [[Prophets in Islam|Prophets]] with regard to bringing the message of the One true God was infallible. Islam also teaches that the Qur'an is an infallible text.

====Additional Shi'a teachings====
{{main|Ismah}}
In [[Shi'a]] theology, the belief is that the [[Ahl al-Bayt]], including [[Muhammad]], his daughter [[Fatima Zahra]] and  [[Shi'a Imams]] are all infallible and do not make mistakes.  It is believed that they are infallible in the sense that all statements or teachings made by them can be relied on to be certainly true, that all information believed by themselves is true, ''and'' that they have complete knowledge about right and wrong and never intend to disobey God, in a sense, ''perfect creation''.  It is also held by Shi'as that there were 124,000 [[Prophets in Islam|Prophets]], beginning with [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] and ending with [[Muhammad]] - with all, including the latter, being infallible in the same sense as the Ahl al-Bayt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.shianews.com/hi/articles/islam/0000006.php |title=Shia News:Infallibility of the Prophets|accessdate=2007-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.answering-ansar.org/shia_viewpoint/khalifatullah_in_shia/en/index.php |title=Answering-Ansar.org - The Khalifatullah in Shi'a Belief|accessdate=2007-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for information about whether or not [[Islam]] states that Moḥammad and other [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Messengers]] or Prophets were always infallible, or unquestionable for any of their acts, see the Qur'an (5: 116) (11: 36 - 37, 40 - 47) (37: 139 - 142) (66: 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|5|116|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|11|36|e=47|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|37|139|e=142|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|66|1|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaishnavism (Hinduism)===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains to Arjuna (Bg 15.16 to 15.20) "There are two classes of beings, the fallible and the infallible. In the material world every living entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every living entity is called infallible. Besides these two, there is the greatest living personality, the Supreme Soul, the imperishable Lord Himself, who has entered the three worlds and is maintaining them. Because I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and because I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as that Supreme Person. Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is the knower of everything. He therefore engages himself in full devotional service to Me, O son of Bharata. This is the most confidential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and it is disclosed now by Me. Whoever understands this will become wise, and his endeavors will know perfection."&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/bg/15/16/en Bhagavad Gita]&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary inline|date=March 2017}}

They became an example as well as an exponent of how the French-speaking bourgeoisie (from Wallonia but also from Flanders) treated their Flemish fellow-citizens, of whom the language – if not its speakers – was considered inferior by the elite.
Later on, the real perpetrators confessed to the murder, which in 1873 led to a debate in [[Parliament of Belgium|parliament]] that ended in the ''Coremans Act'', one of the first laws to recognize Dutch as an official language in Belgium, allowing the Flemish to use their own language at Flemish courts, though not yet in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
On 23 March 1860, widow Dubois was the victim of an assault and robbery by night in [[Charleroi|Couillet near Charleroi]]. She was discovered in agony only the next day, and died of her injuries a few days later. To the village policeman, she had only been able to utter that her attackers spoke "Flemish". Consequently, the attention was drawn on two Flemings who had been making a living in the region, Jan Coucke, a forty-nine-year-old potato salesman born in [[Zwevegem|Sint-Denijs near Kortrijk]], and Pieter Goethals, a railroad worker originating from [[Aalter|Lotenhulle]] and thirty-four years of age.

Their trial in French at the [[Assize Court]] of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] in [[Mons]] started on 20 August 1860. Although both lived in [[Couillet, Belgium|Couillet]], [[Wallonia]], and spoke French for their work, they were assisted by a Dutch translator, Pierre Van Horenbeek.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.lesoir.be/saga-belgica-4-30--coucke-et-goethals-condamnes_t-20080528-00G876.html |title = Coucke et Goethals, condamnés parce qu’ils étaient… coupables |publisher=Le Soir |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate =2011-09-23|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutor Charles-Victor de Bavay obtained their death sentence five days later. They were beheaded on the Grand Market Place of Charleroi a few weeks later.

In 1861, a year after the execution, 14 members of the infamous Black Gang were to appear before the same assize court. The leader of the gang, Leopold Rabet, confessed that French-speaking gang members had killed the widow Dubois. Jean-Baptiste Boucher and Auguste Leclercq confessed to having committed the murder and were sentenced to death. They also confessed that although Coucke and Goethals did not kill the widow, they were their accomplices.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

&lt;!--
In the ''Journal des Tribunaux'' of 21 November 1889, [[Jules Destrée]] held a plea for a revision of the trial. This was five years before Destrée became elected as Socialist [[Member of Parliament]] for the electoral ''[[arrondissements of Belgium#Electoral|arrondissement]]'' of Charleroi--&gt;&lt;!--NO link to 'Ar. of Ch': no longer an electoral arrondissement! and not to the city--&gt;&lt;!--, and many more years before he elated the Walloon soul and opposed the [[Flemish Movement|Flemish]] by the [[Walloon Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;

--&gt;

On 18 July 2005 at the Belgian federal parliament, [[Filip De Man]] directed a series of questions at the vice-prime minister and minister of Justice ([[Laurette Onkelinx]]), regarding the case Coucke and Goethals. His introduction stated that since 1861 there had been several attempts to officially restore the honour of Coucke and Goethals.  In 2000, [[Johan Vande Lanotte]], [[:nl:Siegfried Bracke|Siegfried Bracke]] and Geert Goedertier had still written (in ''België voor beginners. Wegwijs in het Belgisch labyrint'', p.&amp;nbsp;27, die Keure, Brugge) that Coucke and Goethals were not the murderers of the widow, but were informed on the murder.  In 1948, a study by the Flemish journalist Herman Bossier had concluded that there had not been a [[miscarriage of justice]], as according to the journalist, the declaration by Rabet included errors and two other members of the Black Gang, after their trial, had talked about the Flemish as accomplices; the interpreter would not have been a ''gendarme'' from Luxembourg, but a sworn translator of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] origin (''Nederlandse afkomst'').  On five occasions Goethals would have confessed and as chief railroad worker he had to know the French language, while Coucke sold vegetables to French-speaking customers and, having had money problems before the murder, thereafter had means of which he could not demonstrate the origin.

The Member of Parliament then asked whether the ''[[wiktionary:dossier|dossier]]'' of the trial case could be looked into by [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s or by civilians, and whether it corroborated the journalist's statements about Rabet, the interpreter, Goethals' confessions, and Coucke's financial situation.  He also wished to know whether the nine death penalties of 17 January 1862 by the same court of which seven had been reduced, were connected to the Black Gang and thus to Boucher, Leclerq, and Rabet.  Would the Minister of Justice in this case be willing to ask the advice of the Attorney General at the [[Appeal Court]] of Mons, and to ask for the revision of the verdict of 1869, or to provide reasons for not asking the latter.

The Minister replied one year later, on 24 July 2006. The confession of guilt by third parties can be considered as a ''new fact'' having taken place after the conviction, offering the possibility to review the case.  The criticism and advises that several authors may have brought forward, do not form a ground for a revision.  According to the Minister, of the mentioned elements, only the statement by Rabet form such a ground in as far it is of a nature that proves the innocence of the convicts and it has been made in circumstances giving credibility to that statement or confession.  The mentioned information however, does not offer the possibility to assess the reality, the circumstances, and the reach of the declarations by Rabet.  The ''dossier'' on the case can be viewed if the Attorney General at the Appeal Court of Mons gives his permission, even in case it is in the National Archives as it is over a hundred years old.

The book derived from his doctoral thesis, ''Numen, Old Men: Contemporary Masculine Spiritualities and the Problem of Patriarchy'' (Equinox Publishers, 2009) proposed that masculine spirituality tends to perpetuate a patriarchal spirituality, and that gay spirituality and queer theory can be a useful way to think about masculinities for all men, gay or straight. He has published extensively on how masculinity functions in contemporary society and, more specifically,  in contemporary religion. He proposes that by questioning the social construction of masculinity in the everyday it is possible to create a more equitable and sustainable society.

He is perhaps best known for his theories on [[communicative rationality]] and the [[public sphere]]. In 2014, ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' readers chose Habermas as one of their favourites among the "world's leading thinkers".&lt;ref name="prospectmagazine.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/world-thinkers-2014-the-results|title=World thinkers 2014: The results|author=Serena Kutchinsky|date=23 April 2014|publisher=Prospect Magazine |quote=12. Jürgen Habermas, philosopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with the [[Frankfurt School]], Habermas's work focuses on the foundations of [[epistemology]] and [[social theory]], the analysis of [[advanced capitalism]] and [[democracy]], the [[rule of law]] in a critical [[Sociocultural evolution|social-evolutionary context]], and contemporary politics, particularly German politics. Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, [[Political emancipation|emancipation]], and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of [[modernity]], particularly with respect to the discussions of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] originally set forth by [[Max Weber]]. He has been influenced by [[American pragmatism]], [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]], and even [[poststructuralism]].

==Biography==
{{Frankfurt School}}

Habermas was born in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Rhine Province]], in 1929. He was born with a [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft palate]] and had corrective surgery twice during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1451092|title=Disabling Democracy: How Disability Reconfigures Deliberative Democratic Norms|first1=Clifford|last1=Simplican|first2=|last2=Stacy|date=28 October 2017|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2017|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas argues that his speech disability made him think differently about the importance of deep dependence and of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jurgen. 2008. Between Naturalism and Religion: Philosophical Essays. (First chapter).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young teenager, he was profoundly affected by World War II. Until his graduation from [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], Habermas lived in [[Gummersbach]], near [[Cologne]]. His father, Ernst Habermas, was Executive director of the Cologne Chamber of Industry and Commerce, and was described by Habermas as a Nazi sympathizer. He was brought up in a staunchly Protestant milieu, his grandfather being the director of the seminary in Gummersbach. He studied at the universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] (1949/50), [[University of Zurich|Zurich]] (1950/51), and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] (1951–54) and earned a doctorate in philosophy from Bonn in 1954 with a dissertation written on the conflict between the absolute and history in Schelling's thought, entitled, ''{{lang|de|Das Absolute und die Geschichte. Von der Zwiespältigkeit in Schellings Denken}}'' ("The Absolute and History: On the Schism in [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling's]] Thought"). His dissertation committee included [[Erich Rothacker]] and [[Oskar Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.br/books/about/Das_Absolute_und_die_Geschichte.html?id=IOLWAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Das Absolute und die Geschichte: von der Zwiespältigkeit in Schellings Denken|first=Jurgen|last=Habermas |date=1954|publisher=Gummers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1956 on, he studied philosophy and sociology under the critical theorists [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor Adorno]] at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]'s [[Institute for Social Research]], but because of a rift between the two over his [[dissertation]]—Horkheimer had made unacceptable demands for revision—as well as his own belief that the [[Frankfurt School]] had become paralyzed with political skepticism and disdain for modern culture&lt;ref name=cjc352&gt;Craig J. Calhoun, ''Contemporary Sociological Theory'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2002, p. 352. {{ISBN|0-631-21350-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—he finished his ''[[habilitation]]'' in [[political science]] at the [[University of Marburg]] under the Marxist [[Wolfgang Abendroth]]. His ''habilitation'' work was entitled ''{{lang|de|Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit; Untersuchungen zu einer Kategorie der Bürgerlichen Gesellschaft}}'' (published in English translation in 1989 as ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society''). It is a detailed social history of the development of the bourgeois public sphere from its origins in the 18th century salons up to its transformation through the influence of capital-driven mass media. In 1961 he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in Marburg, and—in a move that was highly unusual for the German academic scene of that time—he was offered the position of "extraordinary professor" (professor without chair) of philosophy at the [[University of Heidelberg]] (at the instigation of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Karl Löwith]]) in 1962, which he accepted. In this same year he gained his first serious public attention, in Germany, with the publication of his habilitation. In 1964, strongly supported by Adorno, Habermas returned to Frankfurt to take over Horkheimer's chair in philosophy and sociology. The philosopher [[Albrecht Wellmer]] was his assistant in Frankfurt from 1966 to 1970.

He accepted the position of Director of the [[Max Planck Institute#Former institutes|Max Planck Institute for the Study of the Scientific-Technical World]] in [[Starnberg]] (near [[Munich]]) in 1971, and worked there until 1983, two years after the publication of his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action]]''. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1984.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780&amp;ndash;2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas then returned to his chair at Frankfurt and the directorship of the Institute for Social Research. Since retiring from Frankfurt in 1993, Habermas has continued to publish extensively. In 1986, he received the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] of the {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]}}, which is the highest honour awarded in German research. He also holds the position of "Permanent Visiting" Professor at [[Northwestern University]] in Evanston, Illinois, and "[[Theodor Heuss]] Professor" at [[The New School]], [[New York City|New York]].

Habermas was awarded The [[Prince of Asturias Award]] in Social Sciences of 2003. Habermas was also the 2004 Kyoto Laureate&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/gedavis/JH/Kyoto_lecture_Nov_2004.pdf Public space and political public sphere] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204151440/http://homepage.mac.com/gedavis/JH/Kyoto_lecture_Nov_2004.pdf |date=2012-02-04 }} (pp. 2&amp;ndash;4).&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy|Arts and Philosophy]] section. He traveled to [[San Diego]] and on 5 March 2005, as part of the [[University of San Diego]]'s [[Kyoto Symposium]], gave a speech entitled ''The Public Role of Religion in Secular Context'', regarding the evolution of [[separation of church and state]] from neutrality to intense [[secularism]]. He received the 2005 [[Holberg International Memorial Prize]] (about €520,000). In 2007, Habermas was listed as the seventh most-cited author in the [[humanities]] (including the [[social science]]s) by ''[[The Times Higher Education Guide]]'', ahead of Max Weber and behind [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=405956&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=The most cited authors of books in the humanities |publisher=timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jürgen Habermas is the father of [[Rebekka Habermas]], historian of German social and cultural history and professor of modern history at the [[University of Göttingen]].

===Teacher and mentor===
Habermas is a famed teacher and mentor. Among his most prominent students were the pragmatic philosopher Herbert Schnädelbach (theorist of discourse distinction and rationality), the political sociologist [[Claus Offe]] (professor at the [[Hertie School of Governance]] in Berlin), the social philosopher Johann Arnason (professor at [[La Trobe University]] and chief editor of the journal ''[[Thesis Eleven]]''), the social philosopher Hans-Herbert Kögler (Chair of Philosophy at [[University of North Florida]]), the sociological theorist [[Hans Joas]] (professor at the [[University of Erfurt]] and at the [[University of Chicago]]), the theorist of societal [[evolution]] Klaus Eder, the social philosopher [[Axel Honneth]] (the current director of the Institute for Social Research), the political theorist David Rasmussen  (professor at [[Boston College]] and chief editor of the journal "[[Philosophy &amp; Social Criticism]]"), the environmental ethicist [[Konrad Ott]], the anarcho-capitalist philosopher [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] (who came to reject much of Habermas's thought&lt;ref&gt;[[Lew Rockwell]], introduction to Hoppe's ''A Short History of Man'' (2015), Auburn, Mississippi: Mises Institute, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;), the American philosopher [[Thomas A. McCarthy|Thomas McCarthy]], the co-creator of mindful inquiry in social research [[Jeremy J. Shapiro]], and the assassinated Serbian prime minister [[Zoran Đinđić]].

==Philosophy and sociology==
Habermas has constructed a comprehensive framework of philosophy and social theory drawing on a number of intellectual traditions:&lt;ref name="Habermas, Jurgen 1981"&gt;Habermas, Jurgen (1981), ''Kleine Politische Schrifen I-IV'', pp. 500f.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[German philosophy|German philosophical thought]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]
* the [[Marxist philosophy|Marxian]] tradition—both the theory of [[Karl Marx]] himself as well as the critical [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxian]] theory of the [[Frankfurt School]], i.e. [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]].&lt;ref name="Habermas, Jurgen 1981"/&gt;
* the sociological theories of [[Max Weber]], [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[George Herbert Mead]]
* the [[linguistic philosophy]] and [[speech act]] theories of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J. L. Austin]], [[P. F. Strawson]], [[Stephen Toulmin]] and [[John Searle]]
* the developmental psychology of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]
* the American pragmatist tradition of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[John Dewey]]
* the sociological [[social system|social systems theory]] of [[Talcott Parsons]] and [[Niklas Luhmann]]
* [[Neo-Kantian]] thought&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Doohm, Stefan. Jürgen Habermas. Frankfurt, Suhrkamp, 2008 (Suhrkamp BasisBiographie, 38).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jürgen Habermas considers his major contribution to be the development of the concept and theory of communicative reason or communicative rationality, which distinguishes itself from the [[rationalism|rationalist tradition]], by locating [[rationality]] in structures of interpersonal linguistic [[communication]] rather than in the structure of the [[cosmos]]. This social theory advances the goals of [[human emancipation]], while maintaining an inclusive [[universalist]] [[morality|moral]] framework. This framework rests on the argument called [[universal pragmatics]]—that all [[speech acts]] have an inherent [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]] (the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "purpose")—the goal of mutual [[understanding]], and that human beings possess the communicative competence to bring about such understanding. Habermas built the framework out of the [[speech-act]] philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J. L. Austin]] and [[John Searle]], the sociological theory of the interactional constitution of mind and self of [[George Herbert Mead]], the [[moral development|theories of moral development]] of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], and the [[discourse ethics]] of his Frankfurt colleague and fellow student [[Karl-Otto Apel]].

Habermas's works resonate within the traditions of Kant and [[the Enlightenment]] and of [[democratic socialism]] through his emphasis on the potential for transforming the world and arriving at a more humane, just, and egalitarian society through the realization of the human potential for reason, in part through discourse ethics. While Habermas has stated that the Enlightenment is an "unfinished project," he argues it should be corrected and complemented, not discarded.&lt;ref name=cjc351&gt;Calhoun (2002), p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; In this he distances himself from the Frankfurt School, criticizing it, as well as much of [[postmodernist]] thought, for excessive pessimism, [[Political radicalism|radicalism]], and exaggerations.&lt;ref name=cjc351/&gt;

Within sociology, Habermas's major contribution was the development of a comprehensive theory of [[societal evolution]] and [[modernization]] focusing on the difference between communicative rationality and rationalization on one hand and [[strategic rationality|strategic]] / [[instrumental rationality]] and rationalization on the other. This includes a critique from a communicative standpoint of the differentiation-based [[theory]] of [[social system]]s developed by [[Niklas Luhmann]], a student of [[Talcott Parsons]].

His defence of modernity and [[civil society]] has been a source of inspiration to others, and is considered a major philosophical alternative to the varieties of poststructuralism. He has also offered an influential analysis of [[late capitalism]].

Habermas perceives the rationalization, [[humanism|humanization]] and [[democratization]] of society in terms of the [[institutionalization]] of the potential for rationality that is inherent in the [[communicative competence]] that is unique to the [[human species]]. Habermas contends that communicative competence has developed through the course of evolution, but in contemporary society it is often suppressed or weakened by the way in which major domains of social life, such as the [[Market (economics)|market]], the [[State (polity)|state]], and [[organization]]s, have been given over to or taken over by strategic/instrumental rationality, so that the logic of the system supplants that of the [[lifeworld]].

===Reconstructive science===
Habermas introduces the concept of "reconstructive science" with a double purpose: to place the "general theory of society" between philosophy and social science and re-establish the rift between the "great theorization" and the "empirical research".
The model of "[[rational reconstruction]]s" represents the main thread of the surveys about the "structures" of the world of life ("culture", "society" and "personality") and their respective "functions" (cultural reproductions, social integrations and socialization). For this purpose, the dialectics between "symbolic representation" of "the structures subordinated to all worlds of
life" ("internal relationships") and the "material reproduction" of the social systems in their complex ("external relationships" between social systems and environment) has to be considered.

This model finds an application, above all, in the "theory of the social evolution", starting from the reconstruction of the necessary conditions for a [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogeny]] of the socio-cultural life forms (the "hominization") until an analysis of the development of "social formations", which Habermas subdivides into primitive, traditional, modern and contemporary formations.
"This paper is an attempt, primarily, to formalize the model of "reconstruction of the logic of development" of "social formations" summed up by Habermas through the differentiation between vital world and social systems (and, within them, through the "rationalization of the world of life" and the "growth in complexity of the social systems"). Secondly, it tries to offer some methodological clarifications about the "explanation of the dynamics" of "historical processes" and, in particular, about the "theoretical meaning" of the evolutional theory's propositions.  Even if the German sociologist considers that the "ex-post rational reconstructions" and "the models system/environment" cannot have a complete "historiographical application", these certainly act as a general premise in the argumentative structure of the "historical explanation"".&lt;ref name="Corchia"&gt;{{citation | first = Luca | last = Corchia | chapter = Explicative models of complexity.

===The public sphere===
{{details|public sphere}}
In ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]],'' Habermas argues that prior to the 18th century, European culture had been dominated by a "representational" culture, where one party sought to "represent" itself on its audience by overwhelming its subjects.&lt;ref name=Blanning26&gt;Blanning, T. C. W. ''The French Revolution Class War or Culture Clash?'', New York: St. Martin's Press (1987), 2nd edition 1998, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of "representational" culture, Habermas argued that [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s [[Palace of Versailles]] was meant to show the greatness of the French state and its King by overpowering the senses of visitors to the Palace.&lt;ref name=Blanning26 /&gt; Habermas identifies "representational" culture as corresponding to the feudal stage of development according to Marxist theory, arguing that the coming of the capitalist stage of development marked the appearance of ''Öffentlichkeit'' (the public sphere).&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. pages 26-27"&gt;Blanning (1998), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the culture characterized by ''Öffentlichkeit'', there occurred a public space outside of the control by the state, where individuals exchanged views and knowledge.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27"&gt;Blanning (1998), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Habermas's view, the growth in [[newspaper]]s, [[Literary magazine|journals]], reading clubs, [[Masonic lodge]]s, and [[coffeehouses]] in 18th-century Europe, all in different ways, marked the gradual replacement of "representational" culture with ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /&gt; Habermas argued that the essential characteristic of the ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture was its "critical" nature.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /&gt; Unlike "representational" culture where only one party was active and the other passive, the ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture was characterized by a dialogue as individuals either met in conversation, or exchanged views via the print media.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /&gt; Habermas maintains that as Britain was the most liberal country in Europe, the culture of the public sphere emerged there first around 1700, and the growth of ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture took place over most of the 18th century in Continental Europe.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /&gt; In his view, the [[French Revolution]] was in large part caused by the collapse of "representational" culture, and its replacement by ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /&gt; Though Habermas' main concern in ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'' was to expose what he regarded as the deceptive nature of free institutions in the West, his book had a major effect on the historiography of the French Revolution.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. pages 26-27" /&gt;

According to Habermas, a variety of factors resulted in the eventual decay of the public sphere, including the growth of a [[commerce|commercial]] [[mass media]], which turned the critical public into a passive consumer public; and the welfare state, which merged the state with society so thoroughly that the public sphere was squeezed out. It also turned the "public sphere" into a site of self-interested contestation for the resources of the state rather than a space for the development of a public-minded [[rational consensus]].

His most known work to date, the ''[[Theory of Communicative Action]]'' (1981), is based on an adaptation of Talcott Parsons [[AGIL Paradigm]]. In this work, Habermas voiced criticism of the process of modernization, which he saw as inflexible direction forced through by economic and administrative rationalization.&lt;ref name=cjc353&gt;Calhoun (2002), p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas outlined how our everyday lives are penetrated by formal systems as parallel to development of the [[welfare state]], [[corporate capitalism]] and [[mass consumption]].&lt;ref name=cjc353/&gt; These reinforcing trends rationalize public life.&lt;ref name=cjc353/&gt; Disfranchisement of citizens occurs as political parties and interest groups become rationalized and [[representative democracy]] replaces [[participatory democracy|participatory one]].&lt;ref name=cjc353/&gt; In consequence, boundaries between public and private, the individual and society, the [[Social system|system]] and the lifeworld are deteriorating.&lt;ref name=cjc353/&gt; Democratic public life cannot develop where matters of public importance are not discussed by citizens.&lt;ref name=cjc354&gt;Calhoun (2002), p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; An "[[ideal speech situation]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Democracy, Power and Legitimacy: The Critical Theory of Jürgen Habermas |last=Payrow Shabani |first=Omid A. |year=2003 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn= 0-8020-8761-2 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0802087612&amp;id=tKDU3l3cq60C&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires participants to have the same capacities of discourse, social equality and their words are not confused by ideology or other errors.&lt;ref name=cjc354/&gt; In this version of the [[consensus theory of truth]] Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an ideal speech situation.

Habermas has expressed optimism about the possibility of the revival of the public sphere.&lt;ref name=cjc355&gt;Calhoun (2002), p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; He discerns a hope for the future where the representative democracy-reliant [[nation-state]] is replaced by a [[deliberative democracy]]-reliant political organism based on the equal rights and obligations of citizens.&lt;ref name=cjc355/&gt; In such a direct democracy-driven system, the activist public sphere is needed for debates on matters of public importance and as well as the mechanism for that discussion to affect the [[decision-making process]].

==== Criticism ====
Several noted academics have provided various criticisms of Habermas's notions regarding the public sphere. [[John Thompson (sociologist)|John B. Thompson]], a Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Cambridge]] and a fellow of ''The College of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist and the glorious Virgin Saint Radegund, near Cambridge,'' also known as [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/contacts/fellows/profiles/thompson.html|title=Jesus College website|author=|date=|website=cam.ac.uk|accessdate=28 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601125221/http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/contacts/fellows/profiles/thompson.html|archivedate=1 June 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has claimed that Habermas's notion of the public sphere is antiquated due to the proliferation of mass-media communications.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[Michael Schudson]] from the [[University of California, San Diego]] argues more generally that a public sphere as a place of purely rational independent [[debate]] never existed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[Nancy Fraser]], the Henry A. and Louise Loeb Professor of Political and Social Science and professor of philosophy at [[The New School]] in [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/faculty/?id=4e54-6b31-4d41-3d3d|title=Departments - The New School for Social Research (NSSR)|author=|date=|website=www.newschool.edu|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a noted feminist critic of Habermas' work on the public sphere, arguing for the existence of multiple spheres and counterpublics.

==Habermas versus postmodernists==
Habermas offered some early criticisms in an essay, "Modernity versus Postmodernity" (1981), which has achieved wide recognition. In that essay, Habermas raises the issue of whether, in light of the failures of the twentieth century, we "should try to hold on to the ''intentions of the Enlightenment'', feeble as they may be, or should we declare the entire project of modernity a lost cause?"&lt;ref name="Ritzer, George Pg. 567-568"&gt;Ritzer, George, ''Sociological Theory'', ''From Modern to Postmodern Social Theory (and Beyond)'', McGraw-Hill Higher Education, New York, New York, 2008, pp. 567&amp;ndash;568.&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas refuses to give up on the possibility of a rational, "scientific" understanding of the life-world.

Habermas has several main criticisms of [[postmodernism]]:

# The postmodernists are equivocal about whether they are producing serious theory or literature;
# Habermas feels that the postmodernists are animated by normative sentiments but the nature of those sentiments remains concealed from the reader;
# Habermas accuses postmodernism of a totalizing perspective that fails "to differentiate phenomena and practices that occur within modern society";&lt;ref name="Ritzer, George Pg. 567-568"/&gt;
# Habermas asserts that postmodernists ignore that which Habermas finds absolutely central – namely, everyday life and its practices.

==Key dialogues==

===''Historikerstreit'' (Historians' Quarrel)===
{{Main|Historikerstreit}}
Habermas is famous as a [[public intellectual]] as well as a scholar; most notably, in the 1980s he used the [[popular press]] to attack the German historians [[Ernst Nolte]], [[Michael Stürmer]], [[Klaus Hildebrand]] and [[Andreas Hillgruber]]. Habermas first expressed his views on the above-mentioned historians in the ''[[Die Zeit]]'' on 11 July 1986 in a ''[[feuilleton]]'' (a type of culture and arts opinion essay in German newspapers) entitled "A Kind of Settlement of Damages". Habermas criticized Nolte, Hildebrand, Stürmer and Hillgruber for "apologistic" history writing in regard to the Nazi era, and for seeking to "close Germany's opening to the West" that in Habermas's view had existed since 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen, "A Kind of Settlement of Damages On Apologetic Tendencies In German History Writing", pp. 34&amp;ndash;44 from ''Forever In the Shadow of Hitler?'' ed. Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas argued that Ernst Nolte, Michael Stürmer, Klaus Hildebrand and Andreas Hillgruber had tried to detach Nazi rule and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] from the mainstream of [[German history]], explain away Nazism as a reaction to [[Bolshevism]], and partially rehabilitate the reputation of the [[Wehrmacht]] (German Army) during [[World War II]]. Habermas wrote that Stürmer was trying to create a "vicarious religion" in German history which, together with the work of Hillgruber, glorifying the last days of the German Army on the Eastern Front, was intended to serve as a "kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen "A Kind of Settlement of Damages" pp. 34&amp;ndash;44 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed. Piper (1993), pp. 42&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt; About Hillgruber's statement that Hitler wanted to exterminate the Jews "because only such a 'racial revolution' could lend permanence to the world-power status of his ''Reich''", Habermas wrote: "Since Hillgruber does not use the verb in the subjunctive, one does not know whether the historian has adopted the perspective of the particulars this time too".&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen "A Kind of Settlement of Damages" pp. 34&amp;ndash;44 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed. Piper (1993), pp. 37&amp;ndash;38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas wrote: "The unconditional opening of the Federal Republic to the political culture of the West is the greatest intellectual achievement of our postwar period; my generation should be especially proud of this. This event cannot and should not be stabilized by a kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism. The opening of the Federal Republic has been achieved precisely by overcoming the ideology of Central Europe that our revisionists are trying to warm up for us with their geopolitical drumbeat about "the old geographically central position of the Germans in Europe" (Stürmer) and "the reconstruction of the destroyed European Center" (Hillgruber). The only patriotism that will not estrange us from the West is a constitutional patriotism."&lt;ref&gt;Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called ''Historikerstreit'' ("Historians' Quarrel") was not at all one-sided, because Habermas was himself attacked by scholars like [[Joachim Fest]],&lt;ref&gt;Fest, Joachim, "Encumbered Remembrance: The Controversy about the Incomparability of National-Socialist Mass Crimes", pp. 63&amp;ndash;71 &amp; "Postscript, April 21, 1987", pp. 264&amp;ndash;265 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed. Piper (1993), pp. 64&amp;ndash;65.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hagen Schulze]],&lt;ref&gt;Schulze, Hagen, "Questions We Have To Face: No Historical Stance without National Identity" pp. 93&amp;ndash;97 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed.

Piper (1993), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; and Klaus Hildebrand.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, Klaus, "The Age of Tyrants: History and Politics The Administrators of the Enlightenment, the Risk of Scholarship and the Preservation of a Worldview A Reply to Jürgen Habermas", pp. 50&amp;ndash;55, &amp; "He Who Wants To Escape the Abyss Will Have Sound It Very Precisely: Is the New German History Writing Revisionist?" pp. 188&amp;ndash;195 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed. Piper (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Habermas was supported by historians such as [[Martin Broszat]],&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin, "Where the Roads Part: History Is Not A Suitable Substitute for a Religion of Nationalism", pp. 123&amp;ndash;129, ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed.

===Habermas and Derrida===
Habermas and [[Jacques Derrida]] engaged in a series of disputes beginning in the 1980s and culminating in a mutual understanding and friendship in the late 1990s that lasted until Derrida's death in 2004.&lt;ref name="Derrida, J. Pp. 300-306"&gt;{{Citation |last=Derrida |first=J |author-link=Jacques Derrida |title=Honesty of Thought |work=The Derrida-Habermas Reader |editor=Lasse Thomassen |place=Chicago Ill |publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]] |year=2006 |page=302 |isbn=9780226796833}}&lt;/ref&gt; They originally came in contact when Habermas invited Derrida to speak at The University of Frankfurt in 1984. The next year Habermas published "Beyond a Temporalized Philosophy of Origins: Derrida" in ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'' in which he described Derrida's method as being unable to provide a foundation for social critique.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen, L. "Introduction: Between Deconstruction and Rational Reconstruction" in ''The Derrida-Habermas Reader'', ed. Thomassen (2006), pp. 1&amp;ndash;7. P.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida, citing Habermas as an example, remarked that, "those who have accused me of reducing philosophy to literature or logic to rhetoric ... have visibly and carefully avoided reading me".&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, J., "Is There a Philosophical Language?" in ''The Derrida-Habermas Reader'', ed. Thomassen (2006), pp. 35&amp;ndash;45. P.37.&lt;/ref&gt; After Derrida's final rebuttal in 1989 the two philosophers did not continue, but, as Derrida described it, groups in the academy "conducted a kind of 'war', in which we ourselves never took part, either personally or directly".&lt;ref name="Derrida, J. Pp. 300-306"/&gt;

At the end of the 1990s, Habermas approached Derrida at a party held at an American university where both were lecturing. They then met at Paris over dinner, and participated afterwards in many joint projects. In 2000 they held a joint seminar on problems of philosophy, right, ethics, and politics at the University of Frankfurt.&lt;ref name="Derrida, J. Pp. 300-306"/&gt; In December 2000, in Paris, Habermas gave a lecture entitled "How to answer the ethical question?" at the ''Judeities. Questions for Jacques Derrida'' conference organized by Joseph Cohen and Raphael Zagury-Orly. Following the lecture by Habermas, both thinkers engaged in a very heated debate on Heidegger and the possibility of Ethics. The conference volume was published at the Editions Galilée (Paris) in 2002, and subsequently in English at Fordham University Press (2007).

In the aftermath of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|the September 11 attacks]], Derrida and Habermas laid out their individual opinions on 9/11 and the [[War on Terror]] in [[Giovanna Borradori]]'s ''Philosophy in a Time of Terror: Dialogues with Jürgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida''. In early 2003, both Habermas and Derrida were very active in opposing the coming [[Iraq War]]; in a manifesto that later became the book ''[[Old Europe, New Europe, Core Europe]]'', the two called for a tighter unification of the states of the [[European Union]] in order to create a power capable of opposing American foreign policy. Derrida wrote a foreword expressing his unqualified subscription to Habermas's declaration of February 2003 ("February 15, or, What Binds Europeans Together: Plea for a Common Foreign Policy, Beginning in Core Europe") in the book, which was a reaction to the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s demands upon European nations for support in the coming Iraq War.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, J. and Derrida, J. "February 15, Or What Binds Europeans Together: A Plea for a Common Foreign Policy, beginning in the Core of Europe" in ''The Derrida-Habermas Reader'', ed. Thomassen (2006), pp. 270&amp;ndash;277. P. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas has offered further context for this declaration in an interview.

=== Religious dialogue ===
Habermas' attitudes toward religion have changed throughout the years. Analyst Phillippe Portier identifies three phases in Habermas' attitude towards this social sphere: the first, in the decade of 1980, when the younger Jürgen, in the spirit of Marx, argued against religion seeing it as an "alienating reality" and "control tool"; the second phase, from the mid-1980s to the beginning of the 21st Century, when he stopped discussing it and, as a secular commentator, relegated it to matters of private life; and the third, from then until now, when Habermas has recognized the positive social role of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez, Rosalía. 2011. ''[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/10/07/cultura/1317980044.html 'San' Jürgen Habermas]''. [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]. Access date: January 10, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in 1999 Habermas had stated:

{{quote|For the normative self-understanding of modernity, [[Christianity]] has functioned as more than just a precursor or catalyst. Universalistic [[egalitarianism]], from which sprang the ideals of freedom and a collective life in solidarity, the autonomous conduct of life and emancipation, the individual morality of conscience, human rights and democracy, is the direct legacy of the Judaic ethic of justice and the Christian ethic of love. This legacy, substantially unchanged, has been the object of a continual critical reappropriation and reinterpretation. Up to this very day there is no alternative to it. And in light of the current challenges of a post-national constellation, we must draw sustenance now, as in the past, from this substance.

The original German (from the Habermas Forum website) of the disputed quotation is, 

{{quote|''as Christentum ist für das normative Selbstverständnis der Moderne nicht nur eine Vorläufergestalt oder ein Katalysator gewesen. Der egalitäre Universalismus, aus dem die Ideen von Freiheit und solidarischem Zusammenleben, von autonomer Lebensführung und Emanzipation, von individueller Gewissensmoral, Menschenrechten und Demokratie entsprungen sind, ist unmittelbar ein Erbe der jüdischen Gerechtigkeits- und der christlichen Liebesethik. In der Substanz unverändert, ist dieses Erbe immer wieder kritisch angeeignet und neu interpretiert worden. Dazu gibt es bis heute keine Alternative. Auch angesichts der aktuellen Herausforderungen einer postnationalen Konstellation zehren wir nach wie vor von dieser Substanz. Alles andere ist postmodernes Gerede.''|From Jürgen Habermas - "Zeit der Übergänge" (Suhrkamp Verlag, 2001) p.&amp;nbsp;174f.}}

This statement has been misquoted in a number of articles and books, where Habermas instead is quoted for saying: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christianity, and nothing else, is the ultimate foundation of liberty, conscience, human rights, and democracy, the benchmarks of Western civilization. To this day, we have no other options. We continue to nourish ourselves from this source. Everything else is postmodern chatter.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose Ih-Ren Mong. ''Dialogue Derailed: Joseph Ratzinger's War against Pluralist Theology''. Wipf and Stock Publishers. p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his book ''Zwischen Naturalismus und Religion'' (Between Naturalism and Religion, 2005), Habermas stated that the forces of religious strength, as a result of multiculturalism and immigration, are stronger than in previous decades, and, therefore, there is a need of tolerance which must be understood as a two-way street: [[secular]] people need to [[tolerate]] the role of religious people in the public square and vice versa;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resetdoc.org/EN/Habermas-Istanbul.php A “post-secular” society – what does that mean?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329090452/http://www.resetdoc.org/EN/Habermas-Istanbul.php |date=2009-03-29 }} by Jurgen Habermas, June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Javier |last=Espinosa. |url=http://www.uclm.es/actividades0304/seminarios/spinoza/pdf/cuadernos/22.pdf |title=The religion in the public sphere.

In early 2007, [[Ignatius Press]] published a dialogue between Habermas and the then [[Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] of the [[Holy Office]] [[Joseph Ratzinger]] (elected as [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2005), entitled ''[[The Dialectics of Secularization]]''. The dialogue took place on January 14, 2004 after an invitation to both thinkers by the [[Catholic Academy of Bavaria]] in Munich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERzoAPsS9usC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;ots=uxJYtSd7Bi&amp;dq=the+Dialectics+of+Secularization&amp;lr&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=the+Dialectics+of+Secularization&amp;f=false|title=Dialectics of Secularization: On Reason and Religion|first1=Benedikt XVI|last1=(Papst)|first2=Jürgen|last2=Habermas|date=28 October 2017|publisher=Ignatius Press|accessdate=28 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It addressed contemporary questions such as:
* Is a public culture of [[reason]] and ordered [[liberty]] possible in our [[Post-metaphysical philosophy|post-metaphysical]] age?
* Is philosophy permanently cut adrift from its grounding in [[being]] and [[anthropology]]?
* Does this decline of rationality signal an opportunity or a deep crisis for [[religion]] itself?

In this debate a shift of Habermas became evident—in particular, his rethinking of the public role of religion. Habermas stated that he wrote as a "methodological atheist," which means that when doing philosophy or social science, he presumed nothing about particular religious beliefs. Yet while writing from this perspective his evolving position towards the role of religion in society led him to some challenging questions, and as a result conceding some ground in his dialogue with the future Pope, that would seem to have consequences which further complicated the positions he holds about a communicative rational solution to the problems of modernity. Habermas believes that even for self-identified [[Liberalism|liberal]] thinkers, ''"to exclude religious voices from the public square is highly [[illiberal democracy|illiberal]]."&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Rodney. 2014. ''[http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/12/tis_the_season_to_reveal_what_atheists_really_want.html#ixzz3OPTyHKel Tis the Season to Reveal What Atheists Really Want]''. AmericanThinker. Access date: January 10, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Though, in the first period of his career, he began as a skeptic of any social usefulness of religion, he now believes there is a social role and utilitarian [[moral]] strength in religion, and notably, that there is a necessity of [[Judeochristian]] ethics in culture.&lt;ref&gt;ForumLibertas.com. 2006. ''[http://www.forumlibertas.com/frontend/forumlibertas/noticia.php?id_noticia=6908 Jürgen Habermas, pensador icono de la izquierda, reivindica el valor de la religión]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Habermas has popularized the concept of "[[Postsecularism|post-secular]]" society, to refer to current times in which the idea of modernity is perceived as unsuccessful and at times, morally failed, so that, rather than a stratification or separation, a new peaceful dialogue and coexistence between faith and reason must be sought in order to learn mutually.&lt;ref&gt;Buston, Fernando del. 2014. ''El Estado debe proteger a la religión''. El Comercio. Date access: January 10, 2015: ''"Jürgen Habermas ha acuñado el término de postsecularidad. Se da por fallida la idea central de la modernidad de que la religión iba a desaparecer y se establece una nueva relación entre razón y religión. Habermas plantea que es necesario emprender un aprendizaje mutuo entre las sociedades modernas y las creencias, o entre razón secular y fe. Se inicia una nueva época de mutuas tolerancias. La razón no puede echar por la borda el potencial de sentido de las religiones y éstas deben traducir sus contenidos racionalmente."''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialist dialogue===
Habermas has sided with other 20th century commentators on Marx such as [[Hannah Arendt]] who have indicated concerns with the limits of totalitarian perspectives often associated with Marx's apparent over-estimation of the emancipatory potential of the forces of production. Arendt had presented this in her book ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' and Habermas extends this critique in his writings on functional reductionism in the life-world in his ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action|Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason]]''. As Habermas states: 

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... traditional Marxist analysis ... today, when we use the means of the critique of political economy ... can no longer make clear predictions: for that, one would still have to assume the autonomy of a self-reproducing economic system. I do not believe in such an autonomy. Precisely for this reason, the laws governing the economic system are no longer identical to the ones Marx analyzed. Of course, this does not mean that it would be wrong to analyze the mechanism which drives the economic system; but in order for the orthodox version of such an analysis to be valid, the influence of the political system would have to be ignored.&lt;ref name="Habermas, Jurgen 1981"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Lancichinetti–Fortunato–Radicchi (LFR)''' '''benchmark''' is an algorithm that generates [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] networks (artificial networks that resemble real-world networks). They have ''a priori'' known [[Community structure|communities]] and are used to compare different community detection methods.&lt;ref&gt;Hua-Wei Shen (2013). "Community Structure of Complex Networks". Springer Science &amp; Business Media. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The advantage of LFR over other methods is that it accounts for the [[Homogeneity (statistics)|heterogeneity]] in the distributions of [[Vertex (graph theory)|node]] [[Degree (graph theory)|degrees]] and of community sizes.&lt;ref name="original"&gt;A. Lancichinetti, S. Fortunato, and F. Radicchi.(2008) Benchmark graphs for testing community detection algorithms. Physical Review E, 78. https://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.4770v4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==The algorithm==
The node degrees and the community sizes are distributed according to a [[power law]], with different exponents. LFR assumes that both the degree and the community size have [[Power law distribution|power law distributions]] with different exponents, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of nodes and the average degree is &lt;math&gt;\langle k \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. There is a mixing parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, which is the average fraction of neighboring nodes of a node that do not belong to any community that the benchmark node belongs to.  This parameter controls the fraction of edges that are between communities.&lt;ref name="original"/&gt; Thus, it reflects the amount of noise in the network. At the extremes, when &lt;math&gt;\mu = 0&lt;/math&gt; all links are within community links, if &lt;math&gt; \mu = 1 &lt;/math&gt; all links are between nodes belonging to different communities.&lt;ref&gt;Twan van Laarhoven and Elena Marchiori (2013). "Network community detection with edge classifiers trained on LFR graphs". http://www.cs.ru.nl/~elenam/paper-learning-community.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One can generate a LFR benchmark network in the following steps.

&lt;big&gt;'''Step 1:'''&lt;/big&gt; Generate a network with nodes following a power law distribution with exponent &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and choose extremes of the distribution &lt;math&gt; k_{\min} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; k_{\max} &lt;/math&gt; to get desired average degree is &lt;math&gt;\langle k\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;big&gt;'''Step 2:'''&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;(1 - \mu)&lt;/math&gt; fraction of links of every node is with nodes of the same community, while fraction &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is with the other nodes.

&lt;big&gt;'''Step 3:'''&lt;/big&gt; Generate community sizes from a power law distribution with exponent &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. The sum of all sizes must be equal to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. The minimal and maximal community sizes &lt;math&gt; s_{\min} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; s_{\max} &lt;/math&gt; must satisfy the definition of community so that every non-isolated node is in at least in one community:

: &lt;math&gt; s_{\min} &gt; k_{\min} &lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt; s_{\max} &gt; k_{\max} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Step 4:'''&lt;/big&gt; Initially, no nodes are assigned to communities. Then, each node is randomly assigned to a community. As long as the number of neighboring nodes within the community does not exceed the community size a new node is added to the community, otherwise stays out. In the following iterations the “homeless” node is randomly assigned to some community. If that community is complete, i.e. the size is exhausted, a randomly selected node of that community must be unlinked. Stop the iteration when all the communities are complete and all the nodes belong to at least one community.

&lt;big&gt;'''Step 5:'''&lt;/big&gt; Implement rewiring of nodes keeping the same node degrees but only affecting the fraction of internal and external links such that the number of links outside the community for each node is approximately equal to the mixing parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="original"/&gt;

==Testing==
Consider a [[Partition of a set|partition]] into communities that do not overlap. The communities of randomly chosen nodes in each iteration follow a &lt;math&gt;p(C)&lt;/math&gt; distribution that represents the probability that a randomly picked node is from the community &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Consider a partition of the same network that was predicted by some community finding algorithm and has &lt;math&gt;p(C_2)&lt;/math&gt; distribution. The benchmark partition has &lt;math&gt;p(C_1)&lt;/math&gt; distribution.
The joint distribution is &lt;math&gt;p(C_1, C_2)&lt;/math&gt;. The similarity of these two partitions is captured by the normalized [[mutual information]].

: &lt;math&gt; I_n = \frac{\sum_{C_1,C_2} p(C_1,C_2) \log_2 \frac{p(C_1,C_2)}{p(C_1)p(C_2)} }{\frac 1 2 H(\{p(C_1)\}) + \frac 1 2 H(\{p(C_2)\})} &lt;/math&gt;

If  &lt;math&gt; I_n=1 &lt;/math&gt; the benchmark and the detected partitions are identical, and if &lt;math&gt; I_n=0 &lt;/math&gt; then they are independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Barabasi, A.-L. (2014). "Network Science". Chapter 9: Communities.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|de|'''Landesrabbiner'''}}{{efn|Variant terms: ''Landrabbiner'', ''Oberlandesrabbiner''.}} ({{IPA-de|ˈlandəs.ʁaˌbiːnɐ|lang}}; {{lang-he|רב מדינה|Rav Medinah}}) are [[spiritual leader|spiritual head]]s of the [[History of the Jews in Europe|Jewish communities]] of a country, province, or district, [[History of the Jews in Germany|particularly in Germany and Austria]]. The office is a result of the legal condition of the Jews in medieval times when the Jewish communities formed a unit for the purposes of taxation. As the community had to pay certain taxes to the government, the latter had to appoint some one who should be responsible to it for their prompt collection, and who consequently had to be invested with a certain authority. The office of ''Landesrabbiner'' had no ecclesiastical meaning until the 18th century, when the various governments began to consider it their duty to care for the spiritual welfare of the Jews. Such ecclesiastical authority, owing to the strictly congregational constitution of the communities, never took root among the Jews (see, however, on the [[chief rabbinate]] of [[Moravia]] after the death of [[Marcus Benedict]], [[Moses Sofer]], [[Responsa]], [[Oraḥ Ḥayyim]], 13).

== Earliest Data ==
The transfer of the Jews from the status of imperial to that of territorial subjects, provided by the charter of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] of Austria (1244) and recognized by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles IV]] in his [[Golden bull]] (1356), as well as their very frequent expulsion from the large cities in the 15th and 16th centuries, scattered the Jews in small communities. These were without protection against the arbitrary action of petty tyrants; and they caused the rulers considerable inconvenience owing to constant litigation concerning encroachments on the rights of Jews living under their protection. Therefore the Jews of a given territory organized themselves into an association which elected an advocate ("[[Shtadlan]]") for the protection of their interests. Such an official was recognized by the government as the legal representative of the Jews, whose duty it was to see that the taxes imposed on the Jews as a body were promptly paid, that the laws against usury were obeyed, and who in turn was given jurisdiction in civil cases. This jurisdiction, which he exercised either personally if a scholar or through his deputy if not one, gave the Landesrabbiner an authority within the community. Inasmuch as the Jews from the sixteenth century lived almost exclusively in small communities and could not maintain a rabbi or a rabbinical court (which consisted of three members in every settlement), several communities in a district combined to do so. To this condition of things may be attributed the real creation of the office of ''Landesrabbiner'', the former attempts to appoint a chief rabbi over all the Jews of a country—e.g., in Germany by Emperor [[Rupert of Germany|Rupert]] in 1407, and in Spain, France, and [[Portugal]], partly in the 14th, partly in the 15th, century—having been mostly abortive, and at all events merely fiscal measures designed for the purpose of tax-collecting (see [[Heinrich Grätz]], "''Gesch.''" viii. 8, 102, [[et passim]]; [[Scherer]], ''"Rechtsverhältnisse der Juden"'', p.&amp;nbsp;258; [[Bishop of the Jews]]; [[Hochmeister]]). The first Landesrabbiner of whom there is authentic record is [[Judah Löw ben Bezaleel]], of whom his contemporary [[David Gans]] says that he was for 20 years (1553–73) the spiritual head ("ab bet din") of all the Jewish congregations in the province of Moravia (''"[[Ẓemaḥ Dawid]]"'', year 5352).

== From the 17th century ==
At the time of Löw ben Bezaleel the congregations of Moravia were evidently very small. They were composed of refugees who through the influence of [[Capistrano]] had been expelled from the large cities like [[Brünn]] and [[Olmütz]] (1454) and had settled where any well-disposed lord would receive them under his protection. As they formed communities too small to engage a well-qualified rabbi, they elected to act as their judge one having his seat in one of the largest congregations of the province. Similar conditions prevailed elsewhere. The Jews living in the principality of [[Bamberg]] obtained in 1619 permission to elect a "Paumeister oder obristen Rabbi", and they may have had such an official earlier ([[Eckstein]], ''"Gesch. der Juden im Ehemaligen Fürstbistum Bamberg"'', pp.&amp;nbsp;62, 157, Bamberg, 1898). The communities of the {{Interlanguage link multi|County of Oettingen|de|3=Grafschaft Oettingen|lt=Principality of Oettingen}}, also formed from refugees of larger cities like [[Nördlingen]], had a ''Landesrabbiner'' from early times (Müller, ''"Aus Fünf Jahrhunderten"'', p.&amp;nbsp;171, [[Augsburg]], 1900). The Jews living under the protection of the [[Prince-elector|Elector]] and the [[Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop of Mayence]] had in 1718 [[Issachar Berush Eskeles]] as their ''Landesrabbiner'' ([[Bamberger]], ''"Historische Berichte über die Juden . . . [[Aschaffenburg]]"'', p.&amp;nbsp;18, [[Strasbourg]], 1900). The title was occasionally conferred as a sign of distinction; thus [[Samson Wertheimer]] received in 1717 from Emperor Charles VI. the title of ''Landesrabbiner'' of Hungary ("pro archi sive superiori Judæorum Rabbino"). His son-in-law, the above-named Eskeles, who (although he resided in Vienna, being connected with his father-in-law's banking business there) had succeeded his father, [[Gabriel Eskeles]], as ''Landesrabbiner'' of Moravia, was appointed (1725) at Wertheimer's death his successor as ''Landesrabbiner'' of Hungary ([[Kaufmann]], ''"Samson Wertheimer"'', p.&amp;nbsp;104, [[Vienna]], 1888; [[Wurzbach]], ''"Biographisches Lexikon"'', s.v. "Eskeles").

== As Spiritual Chiefs ==
In the course of the 18th century various governments attempted to influence the internal condition of the Jewish communities, and for this reason legislated with regard to their congregational constitutions. Typical in this respect is [[Maria Theresa]], who in her "General-Polizei-Prozess und Kommercialordnung für die Judenschaft" of Moravia (December 29, 1753) prescribes in detail the duties of the ''Landesrabbiner''; e.g., that he shall assign the tractate which all other rabbis shall adopt for instruction; bestow the title of ''"Doppelter Reb" ("[[Morenu]]")''; see that all taxes are promptly paid; and arrange the complicated election of a new official.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willibald Müller]] (ed.), ''Urkundliche Beiträge zur Geschichte der mährischen Judenschaft im 17. und 18. Jahrhundert'', Olmütz and Leipzig: Kullil and Harassowitz, 1903, pp.&amp;nbsp;86–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Other provinces were to have a ''Landesrabbiner''. Indeed, the empress appointed one for [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]], but he had no successor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Salomon Buber]], ''Ansche Schem: Biographien und Leichensteininschriften von Rabbinen, Lehrhausvorstehern, Religionsweisern, Rabbinatsassesoren und Gemeindevorstehern, die während eines Zeitraumes von vierhundert Jahren (1500 - 1890) in Lemberg lehrten und wirkten'', [[Kraków]]: self-published, 1895, pp.&amp;nbsp;xix et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany it was chiefly in the small states, where the governments directed all affairs, that the institution was established. [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Cassel]] had a ''"Landesrabbinat"'', which was a board constituted on the same basis as the [[Consistory (Protestantism)|Protestant consistory]], but with a ''Landesrabbiner'' as presiding officer. Its establishment was decreed in 1823. Hanover made similar provisions in the law of 1844 on Jewish affairs. Up to 1938&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Schneider, ''Die jüdische Gemeinde in Hildesheim : 1871 - 1942'', Hildesheim: Stadtarchiv, 2003, (=Schriftenreihe des Stadtarchivs und der Stadtbibliothek Hildesheim / Stadtarchiv und Stadtbibliothek Hildesheim. - Hildesheim: Gerstenberg, 1978- ; vol.&amp;nbsp;31), simultaneously: Göttingen, Univ., PhD., 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;4 in chap.&amp;nbsp;'IV. Schlußbetrachtung'. {{ISBN|3-931987-11-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it has had 4 ''Landrabbiner''s, at [[Hanover]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Land Rabbinate of Hanover|de|3=Landrabbinat Hannover}}, est. 1687), [[Hildesheim]] (est. 1842), [[Stade]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Land Rabbinate of Stade|nds|3=Landrabbinat Stood}}, est. 1842; since 1860 served per pro by the land rabbis of Hanover and Emden alternately) and [[Emden]] (est. 1827).&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Löb, ''Die Rechtsverhältnisse der Juden im ehemaligen Königreiche und der jetzigen Provinz Hannover'', Frankfurt upon Main: Kauffmann, 1908, pp.&amp;nbsp;57seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Specially typical conditions existed in the [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], where the government established the institution of ''Landesrabbiner'' May 14, 1839, continuing the 1764-established chief rabbinate for the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]. Here the rabbis ([[Samuel Holdheim]] and [[David Einhorn (rabbi)|David Einhorn]]) were at first supposed to introduce radical reforms, but after the revolution of 1848, when the policy of the government became reactionary, the 1853-newly elected rabbi {{Interlanguage link multi|Baruch Isaak Lipschütz|de}} was intended to strengthen "historic Judaism".&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Donath, ''Geschichte der Juden in [[Mecklenburg]] von den ältesten Zeiten (1266) bis auf die Gegenwart (1874)'', [[Leipzig|Leipsic]]: Leiner, 1874, pp.&amp;nbsp;221 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Saxe-Weimar]] the government used the ''Landesrabbiner'' to enforce the law of June 20, 1823, which ordered that services be held in German (see Hess, Mendel). In [[Saxe-Meiningen]] the Landesrabbinat was organized by the law of Jan. 5, 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Armin Human, ''Geschichte der Juden im Herzogthum S.[achsen]-Meiningen-Hildburghausen'', (=Schriften des Vereins für Sachsen-Meiningische Geschichte und Landeskunde; vol.&amp;nbsp;30), [[Hildburghausen]]: Kesselring, 1898, pp.&amp;nbsp;69 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Here as elsewhere in the small German states the object of the institution was to raise the moral and intellectual status of the Jews.

== In the 19th century ==
By the 19th century, only some of the small states of Germany still had a ''Landesrabbiner'', namely, [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], [[Oldenburg]], [[Birkenfeld]], [[Saxe-Meiningen]], [[Anhalt]], [[Duchy of Brunswick|Brunswick]], and [[Schwarzburg-Sondershausen]]. [[Prussia]], which always proclaimed the principle of non-interference in internal Jewish affairs, retained the office in some of the provinces annexed in 1866, as the 4 Landrabbinate in the [[Province of Hanover]] and in the province of [[Hesse-Nassau]] ([[Kassel|Cassel]]). The office of ''Landesrabbiner'' for the [[province of Brandenburg]], which existed in Berlin and in [[Frankfort-on-the-Oder]], survived, as in other countries, up to the end of the 18th century by virtue of the rabbi's capacity as [[civil judge]]. The last one to hold the title was [[Hirschel Lewin]], while his successor, [[Simon Mayer Weyl]] (d. 1828), held the title of ''"Vice[-]ober[-]landesrabbiner"''. As an exceptional favor the government in 1849 gave to [[Gedaliah Tiktin]] of [[Breslau]] the title of ''Landesrabbiner'', which was interpreted as a manifestation of the government in favor of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]] and as a disapproval of the [[Reform Judaism|Reform movement]] ([[L. Geiger]], ''"[[Abraham Geiger]]'s Leben in Briefen"'', pp.&amp;nbsp;113 et seq., Berlin, 1878).

In Austria [[Samson Hirsch]] held the office for the [[Margraviate of Moravia|province of Moravia]] from 1847 to 1851. He was elected according to the complicated method prescribed in the law issued by Maria Theresa. At the time of his resignation the legal position of the Jewish communities was in a state of chaos owing to the events of 1848, which had played havoc with the principles on which the legislation rested. The government then appointed as substitute [[Abraham Placzek]] of [[Boskowitz]], who in his last years had his son [[Baruch Placzek]] of [[Brünn]] appointed as his assistant. An attempt made by Baron [[Moritz Königswarter]], who was a member of the [[Reichsrat (Austria)#House of Lords|House of Lords]], to introduce into the law of 1890 regulating the legal status of the Austrian Jewish congregations a clause reestablishing the office of ''Landesrabbiner'' of Moravia was defeated in the [[lower house]] of the ''[[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]]h'' ([[Löw]], ''"Das Mährische Landesrabbinat"'', in ''"Gesammelte Schriften"'', ii. 215–218, [[Szegedin]], 1890; [[D'Elvert]], ''"Zur Gesch. der Juden in Mähren und [[Austrian Silesia|Oesterreich. Schlesien]]"'', pp.&amp;nbsp;209–211, Brünn, 1895; [[Willibald Müller]], ''"Beiträge zur Geschichte der Mährischen Judenschaft"'', pp.&amp;nbsp;157–165, Olmütz, 1903). Baruch Placzek is, however, officially addressed by the government authorities as ''"Landesrabbiner"''; he recently appointed [[Solomon Funk]], rabbi of Boskowitz, as his substitute, an appointment which the government confirmed (''"[[Oesterr. Wochenschrift]]"'', 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;190). The office existed also in [[Siebenbürgen]] early in the 19th century.

A similar institution is that of '''''Chief Rabbi''''' of the [[United Hebrew Congregations of the British Empire]], which, however, rests exclusively on voluntary acknowledgement on the part of the congregations, and does not extend over whole groups of congregations like the Portuguese, the Reform, and the Polish organizations. The office of the '''''Grand Rabbin''' du Consistoire Central'' in France is also of similar nature, but differs in that the chief rabbi acts merely in his capacity as member of the [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistory]], and not as hierarchic chief.

[[Image:Solar Magnetic Field Lines.jpg|thumb|The magnetic field lines rotate together with the Sun as a solid object. Ionized material carried along the field lines will at some point &lt;math&gt; r_c &lt;/math&gt; escape the magnetic field lines and thus take away the Sun's angular momentum]]
'''Magnetic braking''' is a theory explaining the loss of stellar [[angular momentum]] due to material getting captured by the [[stellar magnetic field]] and thrown out at great distance from the surface of the star. It plays an important role in the evolution of [[binary star]] systems.

==The problem==
The currently accepted theory of the [[solar systems|solar system's]] evolution states that the Solar System originates from a contracting gas cloud. As the cloud contracts, the [[angular momentum]] &lt;math&gt; L&lt;/math&gt; must be [[angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|conserved]]. Any small net rotation of the cloud will cause the spin to increase as the cloud collapses, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a [[protostar]] forms, which gains heat from the [[gravitational energy]] of the collapse. As the collapse continues, the rotation rate can increase to the point where the accreting protostar can break up due to [[centrifugal force]] at the equator.

Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000 years of the star's life to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind. In the case of our own Sun, when the planets' angular momenta are compared to the Sun's own, the Sun has less than 1% of its supposed angular momentum. In other words, the Sun has slowed down its spin while the planets have not.

==The idea behind magnetic braking==
Ionized material captured by the magnetic field lines will rotate with the Sun as if it were a solid body. As material escapes from the Sun due to the [[solar wind]], the highly ionized material will be captured by the field lines and rotate with the same angular velocity as the Sun, even though it is carried far away from the Sun's surface, until it eventually escapes. This effect of carrying mass far from the centre of the Sun and throwing it away slows down the spin of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Ferreira, J.; Pelletier, G.; Appl, S. |title=Reconnection X-winds: spin-down of low-mass protostars |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |year=2000 |volume=312 |issue=2 |pages=387–397 |bibcode=2000MNRAS.312..387F |doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.03215.x |citeseerx=10.1.1.30.5409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Devitt |title=What Puts The Brakes On Madly Spinning Stars? |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison |date=January 31, 2001 |url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/5732 |accessdate=2007-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same effect is used in slowing the spin of a [[Yo-yo de-spin|rotating satellite]]; here two wires spool out weights to a distance slowing the satellites spin, then the wires are cut, letting the weights escape into space and permanently robbing the spacecraft of its [[angular momentum]].

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}=q \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the charge, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic field vector.  This bending action forces the particles to "[[corkscrew]]" around the magnetic field lines while held in place by a "magnetic pressure"&lt;math&gt; P_B &lt;/math&gt;, or "energy density", while rotating together with the Sun as a solid body:

:&lt;math&gt;P_B=\frac{B^2}{2 \mu_0} &lt;/math&gt;

Since magnetic field strength decreases with the cube of the distance there will be a place where the kinetic gas pressure &lt;math&gt; P_g &lt;/math&gt; of the ionized gas is great enough to break away from the field lines:

:&lt;math&gt; P_g=n m v^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where n is the number of particles, m is the mass of the individual particle and v is the radial velocity away from the Sun, or the speed of the solar wind.

The magnetic field strength as a function of radius can be approximated as:
:&lt;math&gt; B(r)=\frac{D_\odot}{r^3}  &lt;/math&gt;

The critical distance where the material will break away from the field lines can then be calculated as the distance where the kinetic pressure and the magnetic pressure are equal, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt; P_B=P_g \Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{B(rc)^2}{2\mu_0}=n m v^2\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{D_{\odot}^2}{2\mu_0 r_c^6}=n m v^2&lt;/math&gt;

If the solar mass loss is omni-directional then the mass loss &lt;math&gt;n m= \frac{dM/dt}{4\pi r^2 v}&lt;/math&gt;; plugging this into the above equation and isolating the critical radius it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;r_c=\left(\frac{2\pi D_\odot ^2}{\mu_0 v \dot{M}}\right)^{1 \over 4}&lt;/math&gt;

===Present day value===
Currently it is estimated that:
* The mass loss of the Sun is about &lt;math&gt;\dot{M}=dM/dt=2 \cdot 10^9 kg/s&lt;/math&gt;
* The solar wind speed is  &lt;math&gt;v=5\cdot10^5m/s&lt;/math&gt;
* The dipole field is &lt;math&gt;D_{\odot}=8 \cdot 10^{22} T m^3&lt;/math&gt;

This leads to a critical radius &lt;math&gt;r_c =3.4 R_\odot&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the ionized plasma will rotate together with the Sun as a solid body until it reaches a distance of nearly 3.4 the radius of the Sun; from there the material will break off and stop affecting the Sun.

The amount of solar mass needed to be thrown out along the field lines to make the Sun completely stop rotating can then be calculated using the specific angular momentum:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{j_\odot}{j_c}=\left(\frac{R_\odot}{r_c}\right)^2 \approx 10\%&lt;/math&gt;
About 1/10 of the solar mass should thus have been lost by now due to this effect, but if the  present mass loss rate was stable throughout the Sun's "life" only about 0.01% of the Sun's original mass would have been lost. This indicates that either the Sun's mass loss must have been higher in the past or that the Sun's magnetic field has been much stronger.

A '''metatheory''' or '''meta-theory''' is a [[theory]] whose [[wikt:subject matter|subject matter]] is some theory. All fields of research share some [[meta]]-theory, regardless whether this is explicit or correct. In a more restricted and specific sense, in [[mathematics]] and [[mathematical logic]], ''metatheory'' means a ''mathematical theory about another mathematical theory''.

The following is an example of a meta-theoretical statement:{{according to whom|date=April 2017}}
{{quote|Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis; you can never prove it.  No matter how many times the results of experiments agree with some theory, you can never be sure that the next time the result will not contradict the theory.  On the other hand, you can disprove a theory by finding even a single observation that disagrees with the predictions of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Hawking]] in ''[[A Brief History of Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Meta-theoretical investigations are generally part of the [[philosophy of science]]. Also a metatheory is an object of concern to the area in which the individual theory is conceived.

== Taxonomy ==
Examining groups of related theories, a first finding may be to identify classes of theories, thus specifying a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of theories.

==In mathematics==
The concept burst upon the scene of 20th-century philosophy as a result of the work of the [[Germany|German]] [[Mathematics|mathematician]] [[David Hilbert]], who in 1905 published a proposal for proof of the [[consistency]] and [[completeness (logic)|completeness]] of mathematics, creating the field of [[metamathematics]].  His hopes for the success of this proof were dashed by the work of [[Kurt Gödel]], who in 1931, used his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] to prove this [[Hilbert's program|goal of consistency and completeness]] to be unattainable. Nevertheless, his program of unsolved mathematical problems, out of which grew this metamathematical proposal, continued to influence the direction of mathematics for the rest of the 20th century.

The study of metatheory became widespread during the rest of that century by its application in other fields, notably [[Linguistics|scientific linguistics]] and its concept of [[metalanguage]].

'''Noctcaelador''' (from [[Latin]] ''nocturnus'' – nocturnal, ''caelum'' – sky and ''adorare'' – to adore&lt;ref name="questia"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-175442997/academic-orientation-academic-achievement-and-noctcaelador| title =Academic Orientation, Academic Achievement, and Noctcaelador: Does Interest in Night-Sky Watching Correlate with Students' Approach to the Academic Environment?  |publisher =[[Questia]]| author=Kelly, William E.| author2=Daughtry, Don|accessdate =10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[psychological]] construct, introduced by the psychologist [[William E. Kelly]] in 2003 to describe an "emotional attachment to, or adoration of, the [[night sky]]".&lt;ref name="questia"/&gt;

According to Kelly, "noctcaelador has been associated with higher openness to experience, investigative and artistic vocational interests, sensation-seeking, a rational, cognitive approach to problem solving and need for cognition, a propensity to engage in fantasy, a tendency to become deeply involved and attentive to stimuli of interest, and a willingness to consider unusual ideas and possibilities".&lt;ref name="questia"/&gt;

==History==
In a series of lectures in the United States, the philosopher [[George Santayana]] used the appearance of the night sky as an example of what is attractive to the human mind: an intricacy delicately poised between unfathomable complexity and uninteresting simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Barrow| first =John| title =The Artful Universe Expanded| publisher =[[Oxford University Press]]| date =2011 | page =&lt;!-- pages aren't numbered --&gt; | isbn =0191615838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the absence of light pollution in antiquity, stars of the sixth [[apparent magnitude]] were more widely visible by the naked eye. American philosopher [[Holmes Rolston III]] juxtaposed the ancient [[aesthetics]] of the night sky and the modern one: "Today, we are almost amused at the way the ancients fancied various [[constellation]]s there. At night, we no longer admire the [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] as a hunter, any more than by day do we admire a [[cumulus cloud]] as a basket of washing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hrolston/Celestial-aesthetics.pdf| title =Celestial Aesthetics: Over Our Heads and/or in Our Heads |author=Holmes Rolston III|publisher =[[Colorado State University]]|page=5|date=2011| accessdate =10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Asimov]] in his short story ''[[Nightfall (Asimov short story and novel)|Nightfall]]'' (1941) tackled the first experience of the night sky by describing an [[eclipse]] on a fictitious inhabited planet with six suns.

[[File:Panopticon.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Multiview orthographic projection#Elevation|Elevation]], [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|section]] and [[Multiview orthographic projection#Plan|plan]] of Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon penitentiary, drawn by [[Willey Reveley]], 1791]]
The '''Panopticon''' is a type of institutional building and a system of control designed by the English philosopher and social theorist [[Jeremy Bentham]] in the late 18th century. The scheme of the design is to allow all (''pan-'') [[inmate]]s of an institution to be observed (''-opticon'') by a single watchman without the inmates being able to tell whether or not they are being watched. Although it is physically impossible for the single watchman to observe all the inmates' cells at once, the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched means that they are motivated to act as though they are being watched at all times. Thus, they are effectively compelled to regulate their own behaviour. The name may also allude to the many-eyed giant [[Panoptes]] in [[Greek mythology]], some of whose eyes were always awake, making him a highly effective watchman.

The design consists of a circular structure with an "inspection house" at its centre, from which the manager or staff of the institution is able to watch the inmates. The inmates, who are stationed around the perimeter of the structure, are unable to see into the inspection house. Bentham conceived the basic plan as being equally applicable to hospitals, schools, sanatoriums, and asylums, but he devoted most of his efforts to developing a design for a Panopticon prison. It is his prison that is now most widely meant by the term "panopticon".

Bentham described the Panopticon as "a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example".{{Sfn |Bentham |1843d |p=39}} Elsewhere, in a letter, he described the Panopticon prison as "a mill for grinding rogues honest".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Works |volume=10. Memoirs Part I and Correspondence |year=1843 |first=Jeremy |last=Bentham |publisher=Liberty fund |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/bentham-the-works-of-jeremy-bentham-vol-10-memoirs-part-i-and-correspondence?q=a+mill+for+grinding+rogues+honest#Bentham_0872-10_1504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptual history ==
{{quote |Morals reformed—health preserved—industry invigorated—instruction diffused—public burthens lightened—Economy seated, as it were, upon a rock—the [[Gordian Knot]] of the [[Poor Law|poor-law]] not cut, but untied—all by a simple idea in Architecture!{{Sfn | Bentham | 1843d | p = 39}}}}

In 1786 and 1787, Bentham travelled to [[Krychaw|Krichev]] in White Russia (modern [[Belarus]]) to visit his brother, [[Samuel Bentham|Samuel]], who was engaged in managing various industrial and other projects for [[Grigory Potemkin|Prince Potemkin]]. It was Samuel (as Jeremy later repeatedly acknowledged) who conceived the basic idea of a circular building at the hub of a larger compound as a means of allowing a small number of managers to oversee the activities of a large and unskilled workforce.{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | pp = 99–100}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Prisons and prison systems: a global encyclopedia| first = Mitchel P | last = Roth |year= 2006 |publisher=Greenwood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTH31DgbTzgC&amp;pg=PA33|page= 33| isbn = 9780313328565 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy began to develop this model, particularly as applicable to prisons, and outlined his ideas in a series of letters sent home to his father in England.{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | pp = 99–101}}  He supplemented the supervisory principle with the idea of ''contract management''; that is, an administration by contract as opposed to trust, where the director would have a [[pecuniary]] interest in lowering the average rate of mortality.{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | pp = 134–40}}

The Panopticon was intended to be cheaper than the prisons of his time, as it required fewer staff; "Allow me to construct a prison on this model," Bentham requested to a Committee for the Reform of Criminal Law, "I will be the [[gaoler]]. You will see&amp;nbsp;... that the gaoler will have no salary—will cost nothing to the nation." As the watchmen cannot be seen, they need not be on duty at all times, effectively leaving the watching to the watched.  According to Bentham's design, the prisoners would also be used as menial labour, walking on wheels to spin [[loom]]s or run a [[water wheel]]. This would decrease the cost of the prison and give a possible source of income.{{Sfn | Bentham | 1995 | pages = 29–95}}

== Abortive prison project ==
On his return to England from Russia, Bentham continued to work on the idea of a Panopticon prison, and commissioned drawings from an architect, [[Willey Reveley]].{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | p = 118}}  In 1791, he published the material he had written as a book, although he continued to refine his proposals for many years to come. He had by now decided that he wanted to see the prison built: when finished, it would be managed by himself as contractor-governor, with the assistance of Samuel. After unsuccessful attempts to interest the authorities in Ireland and revolutionary France,&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 102–4, 107–8.&lt;/ref&gt; he started trying to persuade the prime minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], to revive an earlier abandoned scheme for a National Penitentiary in England, this time to be built as a Panopticon. He was eventually successful in winning over Pitt and his advisors, and in 1794 was paid £2,000 for preliminary work on the project.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 108–10, 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intended site was one that had been authorised (under an [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, 1760–1779|act]] of 1779) for the earlier Penitentiary, at [[Battersea]] Rise; but the new proposals ran into technical legal problems and objections from the local landowner, [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 169–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sites were considered, including one at Hanging Wood, near [[Woolwich]], but all proved unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 194–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Bentham turned to a site at Tothill Fields, near [[Westminster]]. Although this was common land, with no landowner, there were a number of parties with interests in it, including [[Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor|Earl Grosvenor]], who owned a house on an adjacent site and objected to the idea of a prison overlooking it. Again, therefore, the scheme ground to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 197–217.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, however, it became clear that a nearby site at [[Millbank]], adjoining the [[River Thames|Thames]], was available for sale, and this time things ran more smoothly. Using government money, Bentham bought the land on behalf of the Crown for £12,000 in November 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 217–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

From his point of view, the site was far from ideal, being marshy, unhealthy, and too small. When he asked the government for more land and more money, however, the response was that he should build only a small-scale experimental prison—which he interpreted as meaning that there was little real commitment to the concept of the Panopticon as a cornerstone of penal reform.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 226–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations continued, but in 1801 Pitt resigned from office, and in 1803 the new [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addington]] administration decided not to proceed with the project.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 236–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham was devastated: "They have murdered my best days."&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, a few years later the government revived the idea of a National Penitentiary, and in 1811 and 1812 returned specifically to the idea of a Panopticon.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 265–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham, now aged 63, was still willing to be governor. However, as it became clear that there was still no real commitment to the proposal, he abandoned hope, and instead turned his attentions to extracting financial compensation for his years of fruitless effort. His initial claim was for the enormous sum of nearly £700,000, but he eventually settled for the more modest (but still considerable) sum of £23,000.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 279–81.&lt;/ref&gt; An Act of Parliament in 1812 transferred his title in the site to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Penitentiary House, etc. Act: 52 Geo. III, c. 44 (1812).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bentham remained bitter throughout his later life about the rejection of the Panopticon scheme, convinced that it had been thwarted by the King and an aristocratic elite. It was largely because of his sense of injustice and frustration that he developed his ideas of "sinister interest"—that is, of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest—which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Philip |last=Schofield |title=Bentham: a guide for the perplexed |year=2009 |place=London |publisher= Continuum |isbn=978-0-8264-9589-1 |pages= 90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Millbank Prison|National Penitentiary]] was indeed subsequently built on the Millbank site, but to a design by William Williams that owed little to the Panopticon, beyond the fact that the governor's quarters, administrative offices, and chapel were placed at the centre of the complex. It opened in 1816.

Although most prison designs have included elements of surveillance, the essential elements of Bentham's design were not only that the custodians should be able to view the prisoners at all times (including times when they were in their cells), but also that the prisoners should be unable to see the custodians, and so could never be sure whether or not they were under surveillance. This objective was extremely difficult to achieve within the constraints of the available technology, which explains why Bentham spent so many years reworking his plans.  Subsequent 19th-century prison designs enabled the custodians to keep the doors of cells and the outsides of buildings under observation, but not to see the prisoners in their cells. Something close to a realization of Bentham's vision only became possible through 20th-century technological developments—notably [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV)—but these eliminated the need for a specific architectural framework.

It has been argued that the Panopticon influenced the radial design of 19th-century prisons built on the principles of the "[[separate system]]" (including [[Eastern State Penitentiary]] in [[Philadelphia]], opened in 1829, and the later [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville Prison]] in London and [[Armagh Women's Prison|Armagh Gaol]] in Northern Ireland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Andrzejewski |first= Anna Vemer |title= Building Power: Architecture and Surveillance in Victorian America |place= Knoxville |publisher= University of Tennessee Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-1-57233631-5 |pages= 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these prisons control was exercised through strict prisoner isolation rather than surveillance, but they also incorporated a design of radiating wings, allowing a centrally located guard to observe the door of every cell.

===Claimed influence===
As noted, none of these prisons—with the arguable exceptions mentioned above—are true Panopticons in the Benthamic sense. In some cases, the claims for any influence are very dubious indeed, and seem to be based on little more than the fact that (for example) the design is circular.

Bentham always conceived the Panopticon principle as being beneficial to the design of a variety of institutions in which surveillance was important, including hospitals, schools, workhouses, and lunatic asylums, as well as prisons.

A wooden Panopticon factory, capable of holding 5000 workers, was constructed by [[Samuel Bentham]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], on the banks of the [[Neva River]], between 1805 and 1808: its purpose was to educate and employ young men in trades connected with the navy. It burned down in 1818.{{Sfn|Semple|1993|pp=214–5.}} The Round Mill in [[Belper]], Derbyshire, England, is supposed to have been built on the Panopticon principle with a central overseer. Designed by [[William Strutt (inventor)|William Strutt]], and constructed in 1811, it had fallen into disuse by the beginning of the 20th century and was demolished in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Farmer |first=Adrian |title=Belper and Milford |publisher=Tempus |place=Stroud |year=2004 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Worcester State Hospital]], Massachusetts, USA, constructed in the late 19th century, extensively employed panoptic structures to allow more efficient observation of the wards. It was considered a model facility at the time.

The Panopticon has been suggested as an "open" hospital architecture:

The [[Akron Plan]] common in American Protestant church buildings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is based on similar principles to the panopticon, although there is no evidence of direct influence.

[[File:Contrasted Residences for the Poor.jpg|thumb|right|upright|"Contrasted Residences for the Poor": a plate from [[Augustus Pugin]]'s ''Contrasts'' (1841)]]
Despite the fact that no Panopticon was built during Bentham's lifetime (and virtually none since), his concept has prompted considerable discussion and debate. Whereas Bentham himself regarded the Panopticon as a rational, enlightened, and therefore just, solution to societal problems, his ideas have been repeatedly criticised by others for their reductive, mechanistic and inhumane approach to human lives. Thus, in 1841, [[Augustus Pugin]] published the second edition of his work ''[[Augustus Pugin#Contrasts|Contrasts]]'' in which one plate showed a "Modern Poor House" (clearly modelled on a Panopticon), a bleak and comfortless structure in which the pauper is separated from his family, subjected to a harsh discipline, fed on a minimal diet, and consigned after death to medical dissection, contrasted with an "Antient Poor House", an architecturally inspiring religious institution in which the pauper is treated throughout with humanity and dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Margaret |last= Belcher |chapter=Pugin Writing |editor1-first=Paul |editor1-last= Atterbury |editor2-first= Clive |editor2-last=Wainwright |title=Pugin: a Gothic Passion |publisher=Yale University Press |place= London |year= 1994 |isbn=0-30006012-2 |pages=105–16 (108–9) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, American historian [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] published an essay, "The Haunted House of Jeremy Bentham", in which she depicted Bentham's mechanism of surveillance as a tool of oppression and social control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gertrude |last= Himmelfarb |authorlink=Gertrude Himmelfarb |chapter=The Haunted House of Jeremy Bentham |editor1-first= Richard |editor1-last= Herr |editor2-first=Harold T. |editor2-last=Parker |title=Ideas in History: essays presented to Louis Gottschalk by his former students |publisher=Duke University Press |place=Durham, NC |year= 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel arguments were put forward by French psychoanalyst [[Jacques-Alain Miller]] in an essay entitled "Le despotisme de l'utile: la machine panoptique de Jeremy Bentham", written in 1973 and published in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jacques-Alain |last= Miller |authorlink= Jacques-Alain Miller |trans-title=The despotism of the useful: Jeremy Bentham’s panoptical machine | title=La despotisme de l'utile: la machine panoptique de Jeremy Bentham | language = fr | journal=Ornicar? |volume=3 |year=1975 |pages= 3–36}}; published in English as {{cite journal |first= Jacques-Alain |last= Miller |authorlink= Jacques-Alain Miller |title= Jeremy Bentham's Panoptic Device |journal= October |volume= 41 |year= 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Martin |last= Jay |authorlink= Martin Jay |title=Downcast eyes: the denigration of vision in twentieth-century French thought |place= Berkeley |publisher= University of California Press |year= 1993 |isbn= 0-52008154-4 |pages= 381–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most influentially, the idea of the panopticon was invoked by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], in his ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975), as a metaphor for modern "disciplinary" societies and their pervasive inclination to observe and normalise. This means that the Panopticon operates as a power mechanism. "On the whole, therefore, one can speak of the formation of a disciplinary society in this movement that stretches from the enclosed disciplines, a sort of social 'quarantine', to an indefinitely generalizable mechanism of 'panopticism'".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foucault|1995|pp=195–210}}: quotation at p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The Panopticon is an ideal architectural figure of modern disciplinary power which Foucault proposes had existed before it was named as such. Foucault references quarantine procedures in response to the plague at the end of the seventeenth century, which predate the model of the panopticon but resemble the control dynamic closely. A plague-ridden town would be partitioned, then each house would be locked with guards on each street end in a similar design to the later-theorized panopticon. The Panopticon creates a consciousness of permanent visibility as a form of power, where no bars, chains, and heavy locks are necessary for domination any more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Thomas |last=Allmer |year=2012 |title=Towards a Critical Theory of Surveillance in Informational Capitalism |place=Frankfurt am Main |publisher=Peter Lang |page=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of actual surveillance, the mere threat of surveillance is what disciplines society into behaving according to rules and norms. Furthermore, the spectator of the panopticon changes in Foucault's account, for the idea that fellow people are watching and spectating reinforces the disciplinary society. Foucault proposes that not only prisons but all [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures like the army, schools, hospitals and factories have evolved through history to resemble Bentham's Panopticon. The notoriety of the design today (although not its lasting influence in architectural realities) stems from Foucault's famous analysis of it.

[[File:CCTV graffiti - geograph.org.uk - 977154.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Anti-CCTV graffiti]]
Building on Foucault, contemporary social critics often assert that technology has allowed for the deployment of panoptic structures invisibly throughout society. [[Surveillance]] by [[closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras in public spaces is an example of a technology that brings the gaze of a superior into the daily lives of the populace. Furthermore, a number of cities in the United Kingdom, including Middlesbrough, Bristol, Brighton and London have added loudspeakers to a number of their existing CCTV cameras. They can transmit the voice of a camera supervisor to issue audible messages to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.thehoya.com/viewpoint/092206/view4.cfm | title = Cameras Help Stop Crime | newspaper = The Hoya | date = 22 September 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2006/09/351051.html | title = 2006, But Has 1984 Finally Arrived? | publisher = Indymedia | place = UK | date = 19 September 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, critical analyses of internet practice have suggested that the internet allows for a panoptic form of observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://theoryandscience.icaap.org/content/vol003.001/brignall.html | title = The New Panopticon: The Internet Viewed as a Structure of Social Control | journal = Theory &amp; science | volume = 3 | number = 1 | publisher = ICAAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet Service Providers|ISP]]s are able to track users' activities, while user-generated content means that daily social activity may be recorded and broadcast online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://mobimundi.net/ | title=Workshop: Exploring the Impact of User-generated Mobile Content – The Participatory Panopticon | publisher = Mobi mundi | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120311061007/http://mobimundi.net/ | deadurl=yes| archivedate= 11 March 2012| accessdate= 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shoshana Zuboff]] used the metaphor of the panopticon in her book ''In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power'' (1988) to describe how computer technology makes work more visible. Zuboff examined how computer systems were used to track the behavior and output of workers. She used the term panopticon because the workers could not tell that they were being spied on, while the manager was able to check their work continuously. As the book was written in 1988, Zuboff's arguments were based on the online information service [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]] rather than the [[World Wide Web]]. Zuboff argued that there is a collective responsibility formed by the hierarchy in the Information Panopticon that eliminates subjective opinions and judgements of managers on their employees. Because each employee's contribution to the production process is translated into objective data, it becomes more important for managers to be able to analyze the work rather than analyze the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power | first = Shoshana | last = Zuboff |year=1988 | place =New York | publisher = Basic Books | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url= https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/pluginfile.php/227065/mod_resource/content/1/zuboff_info_panopticon.pdf |pages= 315–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1998 essay, "The Baha’i Faith in America as Panopticon, 1963–1997", academic [[Juan Cole]] compares the [[Bahá'í administration]]'s control over members of the [[Baha'i faith]] to panopticon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole |first=Juan |date=June 1998 |title=The Baha’i Faith in America as Panopticon, 1963-1997 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/1999/jssr/bhjssr.htm |journal=The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=234–238| access-date=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The panopticon has also become a symbol of the extreme measures that some companies take in the name of efficiency as well as to guard against employee theft, documented in a 2009 paper by Max Haiven and Scott Stoneman entitled ''[[Walmart|Wal-Mart]]: The Panopticon of Time''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | format = PDF | url = http://www.opencircle.mcmaster.ca/institute-on-globalization-and-the-human-condition/documents/IGHC-WPS_09-1_HaivenStoneman.pdf | last1 = Haiven | first1 = Max | last2 = Stoneman | first2 = Scott | year = 2009 |title=Wal-Mart: The Panopticon of Time |pages=3–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2014 book by Simon Head, ''Mindless: Why Smarter Machines Are Making Dumber Humans''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Head |chapter=Walmart and Amazon |editor-first=Tim |editor-last=Bartlett |title=Mindless: Why Smarter Machines Makes Dumber Humans |publisher=Basic Books |place=New York, NY |year=2014 |isbn= 0-46501844-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; that describes conditions at an [[Amazon.com]] depot in [[Augsburg]], Germany. Both argue that catering at all times to the desires of the customer can lead to increasingly oppressive corporate environments and [[production quota|quotas]] in which many warehouse workers can no longer keep up with demands of management.

Social theorist [[Simone Browne (sociologist)|Simone Browne]] reviews Bentham's theories in her book ''Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simone |last=Browne |authorlink=Simone Browne (sociologist) |title=Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness |publisher=Duke University Press |place=Durham NC|year=2015 |isbn=9780822359197 |url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/dark-matters }}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that Bentham travelled on a ship carrying a cargo of what he calls "18 young Negresses" while drafting his Panopticon proposal, and argues that the structure of chattel slavery haunts the theory of the Panopticon. She proposes that the plan of the slave ship ''[[Brookes (ship)|Brookes]]'', produced and distributed by the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] in 1789, should be regarded as the paradigmatic blueprint for what she calls "racializing surveillance".

== The Panopticon of Social Media ==

The concept of Panopticon has been referenced in discussions about of the impact of social media. Jake Goldenfein, researcher at the University of Melbourne's Centre for Media and Communications Law explains that, "The relevance of the panopticon as a metaphor begins to wither when we start thinking about whether contemporary types of visuality (effectively digital and data-driven) are analogous to the central tower concept. For example, whether this type of visuality is as asymmetrical, and – I think more importantly – being co-opted for the same political exercise. Does the fact that we don’t know we’re being watched mean we are being normalized in the way the panopticon was intended to correct behaviour?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Thomas|title=What does the panopticon mean in the age of digital surveillance?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/23/panopticon-digital-surveillance-jeremy-bentham|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pay it forward''' is an expression for describing the beneficiary of a good deed repaying it to others instead of to the original benefactor.

The concept is old, but the phrase may have been coined by Lily Hardy Hammond in her 1916 book ''In the Garden of Delight''.&lt;ref name=Hammond&gt;{{cite book |first=Lily Hardy |last=Hammond |title=In the Garden of Delight |publisher=[[Thomas Y. Crowell Co.]] |location=New York |year=1916 |page=209 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjweAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA209 |archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/InTheGardenOfDelight |archivedate=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Pay it forward" is implemented in contract law of [[loan]]s in the concept of [[third party beneficiaries]]. Specifically, the creditor offers the debtor the option of paying the debt forward by lending it to a [[third party beneficiary|third person]] instead of paying it back to the original creditor. This contract may include the provision that the debtor may repay the debt [[in kind]], lending the same amount to a similarly disadvantaged party once they have the means, and under the same conditions. Debt and payments can be monetary or by good deeds. A related type of transaction, which starts with a gift instead of a loan, is [[alternative giving]].

==History==
Pay it forward was used as a key plot element in the [[wikt:dénouement#Noun|denouement]] of a [[New Comedy]] play by [[Menander]], ''[[Dyskolos]]'' (a title which can be translated as "The Grouch"). ''Dyskolos'' was a prizewinning play in ancient Athens in 317 BC; however, the text of the play was lost and it was only  recovered and republished in 1957.

The concept was rediscovered and described by [[Benjamin Franklin]], in a [[s:Franklin to Benjamin Webb|letter to Benjamin Webb]] dated April 25, 1784:&lt;ref name="BenFranklinAutobiography"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franklin|first1=Benjamin|title=Autobiography|date=1917|publisher=Macmillan|page=241|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1XFXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA241#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|I do not pretend to [[gift|give]] such a deed; I only [[loan|lend]] it to you. When you [...] meet with another honest Man in similar Distress, you must pay me by lending this Sum to him; enjoining him to discharge the Debt by a like operation, when he shall be able, and shall meet with another opportunity. I hope it may thus go thro' many hands, before it meets with a Knave that will stop its Progress. This is a trick of mine for doing a deal of good with a little money.}}

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], in his 1841 essay [[Compensation (essay)|''Compensation'']],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emersoncentral.com/compensation.htm Ralph Waldo Emerson, ''Compensation'', 1841, (text of Emerson essay)]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: "In the order of nature we cannot render benefits to those from whom we receive them, or only seldom. But the benefit we receive must be rendered again, line for line, deed for deed, cent for cent, to somebody."

In 1916, Lily Hardy Hammond wrote, "You don't pay love back; you pay it forward."&lt;ref name=Hammond /&gt;

[[Wayne Woodrow Hayes|Woody Hayes]] (February 14, 1913 – March 12, 1987) was a college football coach who is best remembered for winning five national titles and 13 Big Ten championships in 28 years at [[The Ohio State University]]. He misquoted Emerson as having said "You can pay back only seldom. You can always pay forward, and you must pay line for line, deed for deed, and cent for cent." He also shortened the (mis)quotation into "You can never pay back; but you can always pay forward" and variants.&lt;ref name="CoachWoodyHayes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Bob|title=You can always pay forward.|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-01-03/features/9501030136_1_mrs-ballard-woody-hayes-ohio-state|website=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Woody Hayes: Sport Motivational Advice from the Commencement Speech at Ohio State University|url=http://www.graduationwisdom.com/speeches/0022-hayes.htm|website=GraduationWisdom.com|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1929 novel, ''[[Magnificent Obsession]]'', by [[Lloyd C. Douglas]], also espoused this philosophy, in combination with the concept that good deeds should be performed in confidence.

An anonymous spokesman for [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] said in the ''Christian Science Monitor'' in 1944, "You can't pay anyone back for what has happened to you, so you try to find someone you can pay forward."&lt;ref&gt;"Group to Combat Alcoholism Grows Apace in Anonymity"
''Christian Science Monitor'' Jan 8, 1944; pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1944, the first steps were taken in the development of what became the [[Heifer Project]], one of whose core strategies is "Passing on the Gift".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heifer.org/site/c.edJRKQNiFiG/b.201549/|title=Heifer International - Charity Ending Hunger And Poverty|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert Heinlein's contribution===

The term "pay it forward" was popularized by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] in his book ''[[Between Planets]]'', published in 1951:

{{quotation|The banker reached into the folds of his gown, pulled out a single credit note. "But eat first—a full belly steadies the judgment. Do me the honor of accepting this as our welcome to the newcomer."

His pride said no; his stomach said YES! Don took it and said, "Uh, thanks! That's awfully kind of you. I'll pay it back, first chance."

"Instead, pay it forward to some other brother who needs it."}}

Heinlein both preached and practiced this philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Today, the [[Heinlein Society]], a humanitarian organization founded in his name, practices it in the form of various programs such as blood drives, free educational CDs for teachers, and US$500 scholarships.&lt;ref name="hsforward"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heinleinsociety.org/pay-it-forward/ | title=Pay It Forward | publisher=The Heinlein Society | accessdate=February 8, 2018 | quote=The most important aspect of Robert Heinlein’s legacy that we at The Heinlein Society support and adhere to is his concept of paying it forward.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Author [[Spider Robinson]] made repeated reference to the doctrine, attributing it to his spiritual mentor Heinlein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.heinleinsociety.org/CentennialReader/heinleinsociety.html |title = The Heinlein Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}}

Heinlein was a mentor to [[Ray Bradbury]], giving him help and quite possibly passing on the concept, made famous by the publication of a letter from him to Heinlein thanking him. In Bradbury's novel ''[[Dandelion Wine]]'', published in 1957, when the main character Douglas Spaulding is reflecting on his life being saved by Mr. Jonas, the Junkman:

{{quotation|How do I thank Mr. Jonas, he wondered, for what he's done?  How do I thank him, how pay him back? No way, no way at all. You just can't pay. What then? What? Pass it on somehow, he thought, pass it on to someone else. Keep the chain moving. Look around, find someone, and pass it on. That was the only way....}}

Bradbury has also advised that writers he has helped thank him by helping other writers.

Some time in 1980, a sixteen-page supplemental [[Marvel Comics|Marvel comic]] appeared in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' entitled “What Price a Life?” and was subsequently reprinted as the backup story in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #126 dated February, 1983. This was a team-up between [[Spider-Man]] and [[The Incredible Hulk]], in which Spider-Man helps the Hulk escape from police who mistakenly thought that he was attacking them. Afterwards, they meet in their secret identities, with [[Peter Parker]] warning [[Bruce Banner]] to leave town because of the Hulk’s seeming attack on police. But Banner is flat broke, and cannot afford even bus fare. As a result, Parker gives Banner his last $5 bill, saying that someone had given him money when he was down on his luck, and this was how he was repaying that debt. Later, in Chicago, the Hulk confronts muggers who had just robbed an elderly retired man of his pension money, all the money he had. After corralling the muggers, the Hulk turns towards the victim. The retiree thinks that the Hulk is about to attack him as well, but instead, the Hulk gives him the $5 bill. It transpires that the very same old man had earlier given a down-on-his-luck Peter Parker a $5 bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Sjoerdsma |first = Al |title = Review of "What Price a Life?" |url = http://spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/spiderman_promo_newspaper/price_chicago.html |work = ComicBoards.com |publisher = SpiderFan.org |accessdate = 6 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Catherine Ryan Hyde]]'s novel ''[[Pay It Forward (novel)|Pay It Forward]]'' was published and adapted into a [[Pay It Forward (film)|film of the same name]], distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] and starring [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Helen Hunt]] and [[Haley Joel Osment]]. In Ryan Hyde's book and movie it is described as an obligation to do three good deeds for others in response to a good deed that one receives. Such good deeds should accomplish things that the other person cannot accomplish on their own. In this way, the practice of helping one another can spread geometrically through [[society]], at a ratio of three to one, creating a [[social movement]] with an impact of making the world a better place.

The Pay it Forward Movement and Foundation&lt;ref name=PIFF&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.payitforwardfoundation.org/ |work=Pay It Forward Foundation |title=HOME |publisher= |accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in the USA helping start a ripple effect of kindness acts around the world. The newly appointed president of the foundation, Charley Johnson, had an idea for encouraging kindness acts by having a Pay it Forward Bracelet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pifexperience.org/ |title=Web hosting provider - Bluehost.com - domain hosting - PHP Hosting - cheap web hosting - Frontpage Hosting E-Commerce Web Hosting Bluehost|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that could be worn as a reminder. Since then, over a million Pay it Forward bracelets have been distributed in over 100 countries sparking acts of kindness. Few bracelets remain with their original recipients, however, as they circulate in the spirit of the reciprocal or generalized altruism.

In 2007, International [http://www.payitforwardday.com Pay it Forward Day] was founded in Australia by Blake Beattie. It has now spread to 70 countries with over 50 state and city proclamations. It is estimated that it has inspired over 5 million acts of kindness and has featured on 7, 9, 10, ABC, NBC, Fox 5, Fox 8 and [[Global News]] in Canada.

On April 5, 2012, [[WBRZ-TV]], the [[American Broadcasting Company]] affiliate for the city of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]], did a story on The Newton Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewtonproject.com |title=The Newton Project|publisher=|accessdate=2018-01-31 | deadurl=usurped| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160111205312/http://thenewtonproject.com/| archive-date= 11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 501(c)(3) outreach organization created to demonstrate that regardless of how big the problems of the world may seem, each person can make a difference simply by taking the time to show love, appreciation and kindness to the people around them. It is based on the classic pay-it-forward concept, but demonstrates the impact of each act on the world by tracking each wristband with a unique ID number and quantifying the lives each has touched. The Newton Project’s attempt to quantify the benefits of a Pay It Forward type system can be viewed by the general public at their website.

Inspired by [[John F. Kennedy]] who profoundly declared, "Let us think of education as the means of developing our greatest abilities, because in each of us there is a private hope and dream which, fulfilled, can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for our nation", The Student Body of America Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studentbodyofamerica.org |title=Home |work=Project Pay It Forward| date=20 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[501(c)3]] nonprofit organization, has initiated its Project Pay it Forward&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectpayitforward.org/|title=Home|first=Project Pay It|last=Forward|date=20 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; program to implement education with the pay-it-forward concept.

Businesses have also adopted the concept as part of their [[organizational culture|corporate culture.]] [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo, N.D.]]-based [[Bell Bank]] started a Pay It Forward program in 2007, inspired by [[Oprah Winfrey]]’s “Pay It Forward” project.&lt;ref name="inforum.com"&gt;The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead, December 18, 2007 http://www.inforum.com/content/state-banks-pay-it-forward-initiative-receiving-worldwide-media-attention&lt;/ref&gt; The program gives full-time employees $1,000 and part-time employees $500 each year to give to people and organizations in need.&lt;ref name="bmag.bushfoundation.org"&gt;Bush Foundation http://bmag.bushfoundation.org/buzz/who-michael-solberg&lt;/ref&gt; Employees are also given $1,000 to give to a customer, vendor or community member to donate to someone else.&lt;ref name="bmag.bushfoundation.org"/&gt; The program has given out more than $8 million so far.&lt;ref&gt;Northwestern Financial Review, June 1, 2016 http://www.northwesternfinancialreview.com/issue/northwestern-financial-review/article/bell-state-bank-rings-in-50th-anniversary&lt;/ref&gt;

After launching the program, Michael Solberg, [[Bell Bank]]’s president and CEO, appeared on a number of news outlets to talk about it, including ''[[Good Morning America]]'', [[CBS]]’s ''[[The Early Show]]'', [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]&lt;ref name="inforum.com"/&gt; and ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' with [[Katie Couric]].&lt;ref&gt;The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead, January 10, 2008 http://www.inforum.com/content/banks-pay-it-forward-effort-be-featured-cbs-news&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pearson distribution''' is a family of [[continuous probability distribution|continuous]] [[probability distribution]]s. It was first published by [[Karl Pearson]] in 1895 and subsequently extended by him in 1901 and 1916 in a series of articles on [[biostatistics]].

== History ==
The Pearson system was originally devised in an effort to model visibly [[skewness|skew]]ed observations. It was well known at the time how to adjust a theoretical model to fit the first two [[cumulant]]s or [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s of observed data: Any [[probability distribution]] can be extended straightforwardly to form a [[location-scale family]]. Except in [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] cases, a location-scale family can be made to fit the observed [[mean (mathematics)|mean]] (first cumulant) and [[variance]] (second cumulant) arbitrarily well. However, it was not known how to construct probability distributions in which the [[skewness]] (standardized third cumulant) and [[kurtosis]] (standardized fourth cumulant) could be adjusted equally freely. This need became apparent when trying to fit known theoretical models to observed data that exhibited skewness. Pearson's examples include survival data, which are usually asymmetric.

In his original paper, Pearson (1895, p.&amp;nbsp;360) identified four types of distributions (numbered I through IV) in addition to the [[normal distribution]] (which was originally known as type V). The classification depended on whether the distributions were [[support (mathematics)|support]]ed on a bounded interval, on a half-line, or on the whole [[real line]]; and whether they were potentially skewed or necessarily symmetric. A second paper (Pearson 1901) fixed two omissions: it redefined the type V distribution (originally just the [[normal distribution]], but now the [[inverse-gamma distribution]]) and introduced the type VI distribution. Together the first two papers cover the five main types of the Pearson system (I, III, IV, V, and VI). In a third paper, Pearson (1916) introduced further special cases and subtypes (VII through XII).

Rhind (1909, pp.&amp;nbsp;430–432) devised a simple way of visualizing the parameter space of the Pearson system, which was subsequently adopted by Pearson (1916, plate 1 and pp.&amp;nbsp;430ff., 448ff.). The Pearson types are characterized by two quantities, commonly referred to as β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The first is the square of the [[skewness]]: &lt;math&gt;\beta_1 = \gamma_1^2&lt;/math&gt; where γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the skewness, or third [[standardized moment]]. The second is the traditional [[kurtosis]], or fourth standardized moment: β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3. (Modern treatments define kurtosis γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of cumulants instead of moments, so that for a normal distribution we have γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 3. Here we follow the historical precedent and use β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.) The diagram on the right shows which Pearson type a given concrete distribution (identified by a point (β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) belongs to.

Many of the skewed and/or non-[[mesokurtic]] distributions familiar to us today were still unknown in the early 1890s. What is now known as the [[beta distribution]] had been used by [[Thomas Bayes]] as a [[posterior distribution]] of the parameter of a [[Bernoulli distribution]] in his 1763 work on [[inverse probability]]. The Beta distribution gained prominence due to its membership in Pearson's system and was known until the 1940s as the Pearson type I distribution.

(Pearson's type II distribution is a special case of type I, but is usually no longer singled out.) The [[gamma distribution]] originated from Pearson's work (Pearson 1893, p.&amp;nbsp;331; Pearson 1895, pp.&amp;nbsp;357, 360, 373–376) and was known as the Pearson type III distribution, before acquiring its modern name in the 1930s and 1940s.

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearson's 1895 paper introduced the type IV distribution, which contains [[Student's t-distribution|Student's ''t''-distribution]] as a special case, predating [[William Sealy Gosset]]'s subsequent use by several years. His 1901 paper introduced the [[inverse-gamma distribution]] (type V) and the [[beta prime distribution]] (type VI).

== Definition ==
A Pearson [[probability density function|density]] ''p'' is defined to be any valid solution to the [[differential equation]] (cf. Pearson 1895, p.&amp;nbsp;381)

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p'(x)}{p(x)} + \frac{a+(x-\lambda)}{b_0+b_1(x-\lambda)+b_2(x-\lambda)^2} = 0. \qquad (1) \!&lt;/math&gt;
with :

: &lt;math&gt; b_0=\frac{4 \beta_2-3 \beta_1}{10 \beta_2 -12\beta_1 -18} \mu_2 ,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; a=b_1=\sqrt{\mu_2} \sqrt{\beta_1}\frac{\beta_2+3}{10 \beta_2-12\beta_1 -18},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;b_2=\frac{2 \beta_2-3 \beta_1 -6}{10 \beta_2-12\beta_1 -18} .&lt;/math&gt;

According to Ord,&lt;ref&gt;Ord J.K. (1972) p2&lt;/ref&gt; Pearson devised the underlying form of Equation (1) on the basis of, firstly, the formula for the derivative of the logarithm of the density function of the [[normal distribution]] (which gives a linear function) and, secondly, from a recurrence relation for values in the [[probability mass function]] of the [[hypergeometric distribution]] (which yields the linear-divided-by-quadratic structure).

In Equation (1), the parameter ''a'' determines a [[stationary point]], and hence under some conditions a [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of the distribution, since

:&lt;math&gt;p'(\lambda-a) = 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;

follows directly from the differential equation.

Since we are confronted with a [[linear differential equation#First order equation|first order linear differential equation with variable coefficients]], its solution is straightforward:

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) \propto \exp\left( -\!\int\!\!\frac{x-a}{b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0} \,\mathrm{d}x \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The integral in this solution simplifies considerably when certain special cases of the integrand are considered. Pearson (1895, p.&amp;nbsp;367) distinguished two main cases, determined by the sign of the [[discriminant]] (and hence the number of real [[Root of a function|root]]s) of the [[quadratic function]]

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = b_2\,x^2 + b_1\,x + b_0. \qquad (2)\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Particular types of distribution==

=== Case 1, negative discriminant: The Pearson type IV distribution ===

If the discriminant of the quadratic function (2) is negative (&lt;math&gt;b_1^2 - 4 b_2 b_0 &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), it has no real roots. Then define

:&lt;math&gt;y = x + \frac{b_1}{2\,b_2} \!&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{\sqrt{4\,b_2\,b_0 - b_1^2\,}}{2\,b_2}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that α is a well-defined real number and α ≠ 0, because by assumption &lt;math&gt;4 b_2 b_0 - b_1^2 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and therefore ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0. Applying these substitutions, the quadratic function (2) is transformed into

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = b_2\,(y^2 + \alpha^2). \!&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--NB: ^^^ don't change this to y, f is still a function of x.--&gt;

The absence of real roots is obvious from this formulation, because α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is necessarily positive.

We now express the solution to the differential equation (1) as a function of ''y'':

:&lt;math&gt;p(y) \propto \exp\left(- \frac{1}{b_2}\, \int\frac{y - \frac{b_1}{2\,b_2} - a}{y^2 + \alpha^2} \,\mathrm{d}y  \right). \!&lt;/math&gt;

Pearson (1895, p.&amp;nbsp;362) called this the "trigonometrical&lt;!--sic--&gt; case", because the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{y-\frac{2\,b_2\,a + b_1}{2\,b_2}}{y^2 + \alpha^2} \,\mathrm{d}y = \frac{1}{2} \ln(y^2 + \alpha^2) - \frac{2\,b_2\,a + b_1}{2\,b_2\,\alpha}\arctan\left(\frac{y}{\alpha}\right) + C_0&lt;/math&gt;

involves the [[inverse trigonometric function|inverse]] [[trigonometric function|trigonometric]] arctan function.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;p(y) \propto \exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2\,b_2} \ln\!\left(1+\frac{y^2}{\alpha^2}\right) -\frac{\ln\alpha}{b_2} +\frac{2\,b_2\,a + b_1}{2\,b_2^2\,\alpha} \arctan\left(\frac{y}{\alpha}\right) + C_1 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, let

:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{1}{2\,b_2} \!&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and
:&lt;math&gt;\nu = -\frac{2\,b_2\,a + b_1}{2\,b_2^2\,\alpha} \!&lt;/math&gt;

Applying these substitutions, we obtain the parametric function:

:&lt;math&gt;p(y) \propto  \left[1 + \frac{y^2}{\alpha^2}\right]^{-m} \exp\left[-\nu \arctan\left(\frac{y}{\alpha}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

This unnormalized density has [[support (mathematics)|support]] on the entire [[real line]]. It depends on a [[scale parameter]] α &gt; 0 and [[shape parameter]]s ''m'' &gt; 1/2 and ν. One parameter was lost when we chose to find the solution to the differential equation (1) as a function of ''y'' rather than ''x''. We therefore reintroduce a fourth parameter, namely the [[location parameter]] ''λ''. We have thus derived the density of the '''Pearson type IV distribution''':

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = \frac{\left|\frac{\Gamma\!\left(m+\frac{\nu}{2}i\right)}{\Gamma(m)}\right|^2}{\alpha\,\mathrm{\Beta}\!\left(m-\frac12, \frac12\right)}
\left[1 + \left(\frac{x-\lambda}{\alpha}\right)^{\!2\,} \right]^{-m} \exp\left[-\nu \arctan\left(\frac{x-\lambda}{\alpha}\right)\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[normalizing constant]] involves the [[complex function|complex]] [[Gamma function]] (Γ) and the [[Beta function]] (B).

==== The Pearson type VII distribution ====
[[Image:Pearson type VII distribution PDF.png|300px|thumb|Plot of Pearson type VII densities with λ = 0, σ = 1, and: γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ∞ (red); γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 4 (blue); and γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 (black)]]

The shape parameter ''ν'' of the Pearson type IV distribution controls its [[skewness]]. If we fix its value at zero, we obtain a symmetric three-parameter family. This special case is known as the '''Pearson type VII distribution''' (cf. Pearson 1916, p.&amp;nbsp;450). Its density is

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = \frac{1}{\alpha\,\mathrm{\Beta}\!\left(m-\frac12, \frac12\right)} \left[1 + \left(\frac{x-\lambda}{\alpha}\right)^{\!2\,} \right]^{-m},&lt;/math&gt;

where B is the [[Beta function]].

An alternative parameterization (and slight specialization) of the type VII distribution is obtained by letting

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \sigma\,\sqrt{2\,m-3}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

which requires ''m'' &gt; 3/2. This entails a minor loss of generality but ensures that the [[variance]] of the distribution exists and is equal to σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Now the parameter ''m'' only controls the [[kurtosis]] of the distribution. If ''m'' approaches infinity as ''λ'' and ''σ'' are held constant, the [[normal distribution]] arises as a special case:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{1}{\sigma\,\sqrt{2\,m-3}\,\mathrm{\Beta}\!\left(m-\frac12, \frac12\right)} \left[1 + \left(\frac{x-\lambda}{\sigma\,\sqrt{2\,m-3}}\right)^{\!2\,} \right]^{-m}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{\sigma\,\sqrt{2}\,\Gamma\!\left(\frac12\right)} \times \lim_{m\to\infty} \frac{\Gamma(m)}{\Gamma\!\left(m-\frac12\right) \sqrt{m-\frac32}} \times \lim_{m\to\infty} \left[1 + \frac{\left(\frac{x-\lambda}{\sigma}\right)^2}{2\,m-3} \right]^{-m}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\,\pi}} \times 1 \times \exp\!\left[-\frac12 \left(\frac{x-\lambda}{\sigma}\right)^{\!2\,} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

This is the density of a normal distribution with mean ''λ'' and standard deviation ''σ''.

It is convenient to require that ''m'' &gt; 5/2 and to let

:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac52 + \frac{3}{\gamma_2}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

This is another specialization, and it guarantees that the first four moments of the distribution exist. More specifically, the Pearson type VII distribution parameterized in terms of (λ, σ, γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has a mean of ''λ'', [[standard deviation]] of ''σ'', [[skewness]] of zero, and [[excess kurtosis]] of γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==== Student's ''t''-distribution ====
The Pearson type VII distribution is equivalent to the non-standardized [[Student's t-distribution|Student's ''t''-distribution]] with parameters ν &gt; 0, μ, σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by applying the following substitutions to its original parameterization:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \mu, \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \sqrt{\nu\sigma^2}, \!&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and
:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{\nu+1}{2}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that the constraint ''m'' &gt; 1/2 is satisfied.

The resulting density is

:&lt;math&gt;p(x|\mu,\sigma^2,\nu) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\nu\sigma^2}\,\mathrm{\Beta}\!\left(\frac{\nu}{2}, \frac12\right)} \left(1+\frac{1}{\nu}\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}\right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}, &lt;/math&gt;

which is easily recognized as the density of a Student's ''t''-distribution.

Note also that this implies that the Pearson type VII distribution subsumes the standard [[Student's t-distribution|Student's ''t''-distribution]] and also the standard [[Cauchy distribution]]. In particular, the standard Student's ''t''-distribution arises as a subcase, when μ = 0 and σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, equivalent to the following substitutitons:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = 0, \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \sqrt{\nu}, \!&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and
:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{\nu+1}{2}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

The density of this restricted one-parameter family is a standard Student's ''t'':

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\nu}\,\mathrm{\Beta}\!\left(\frac{\nu}{2}, \frac12\right)} \left(1 + \frac{x^2}{\nu} \right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}},&lt;/math&gt;

=== Case 2, non-negative discriminant ===
If the quadratic function (2) has a non-negative discriminant (&lt;math&gt;b_1^2 - 4 b_2 b_0 \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;), it has real roots ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (not necessarily distinct):

:&lt;math&gt;a_1 = \frac{-b_1 - \sqrt{b_1^2 - 4 b_2 b_0}}{2 b_2}, \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_2 = \frac{-b_1 + \sqrt{b_1^2 - 4 b_2 b_0}}{2 b_2}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

In the presence of real roots the quadratic function (2) can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = b_2\,(x-a_1)(x-a_2), \!&lt;/math&gt;

and the solution to the differential equation is therefore

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) \propto \exp\left( -\frac{1}{b_2} \int\!\!\frac{x-a}{(x - a_1) (x - a_2)} \,\mathrm{d}x \right). \!&lt;/math&gt;

Pearson (1895, p.&amp;nbsp;362) called this the "logarithmic case", because the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int\!\!\frac{x-a}{(x - a_1) (x - a_2)} \,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{(a_1-a)\ln(x-a_1) - (a_2-a)\ln(x-a_2)}{a_1-a_2} + C&lt;/math&gt;

involves only the [[logarithm]] function, and not the arctan function as in the previous case.

Using the substitution

:&lt;math&gt;\nu = \frac{1}{b_2\,(a_1-a_2)} \!&lt;/math&gt;

we obtain the following solution to the differential equation (1):

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) \propto (x-a_1)^{-\nu (a_1-a)} (x-a_2)^{\nu (a_2-a)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since this density is only known up to a hidden constant of proportionality, that constant can be changed and the density written as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) \propto \left(1-\frac{x}{a_1}\right)^{-\nu (a_1-a)} \left(1-\frac{x}{a_2}\right)^{ \nu (a_2-a)}&lt;/math&gt;

==== The Pearson type I distribution ====
The '''Pearson type I distribution''' (a generalization of the [[beta distribution]]) arises when the roots of the quadratic equation (2) are of opposite sign, that is, &lt;math&gt;a_1 &lt; 0 &lt; a_2&lt;/math&gt;. Then the solution ''p'' is supported on the interval &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2)&lt;/math&gt;. Apply the substitution

:&lt;math&gt;x = a_1 + y (a_2 - a_1) \qquad \mbox{where}\ 0&lt;y&lt;1, \!&lt;/math&gt;

which yields a solution in terms of ''y'' that is supported on the interval (0, 1):

:&lt;math&gt;p(y) \propto \left(\frac{a_1-a_2}{a_1}\;y\right)^{(-a_1+a)\nu} \left(\frac{a_2-a_1}{a_2}\;(1-y)\right)^{(a_2-a)\nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

One may define:
:&lt;math&gt; m_1=\frac{a-a_1}{b_2 (a_1-a_2)} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; m_2=\frac{a-a_2}{b_2 (a_2-a_1)}\!&lt;/math&gt;

Regrouping constants and parameters, this simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt;p(y) \propto y^{m_1} (1-y)^{m_2}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;\frac{x-\lambda-a_1}{a_2-a_1}&lt;/math&gt; follows a &lt;math&gt;\Beta(m_1+1,m_2+1)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\lambda=\mu_1-(a_2-a_1) \frac{m_1+1}{m_1+m_2+2}-a_1&lt;/math&gt;

It turns out that ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; −1 is necessary and sufficient for ''p'' to be a proper probability density function.

==== The Pearson type II distribution ====
The '''Pearson type II distribution''' is a special case of the Pearson type I family restricted to symmetric distributions.

For the Pearson Type II Curve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor = 1165017 | title = Critical Values for Spearman's Rank Order Correlation | last = Ramsey| first = Philip H.| date = 1989-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y = y_{0}\left(1-\frac{x^2}{a^2}\right)^m&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;x = \sum d^2/2 -(n^3-n)/12&lt;/math&gt;

the ordinate, ''y'', is the frequency of &lt;math&gt;\sum d^2&lt;/math&gt;. The Pearson Type II Curve is used in computing the table of significant correlation coefficients for [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]] when the number of items in a series is less than 100 (or 30, depending on some sources). After that, the distribution mimics a standard [[Student's t-distribution]]. For the table of values, certain values are used as the constants in the previous equation:

:&lt;math&gt;m     = \frac{5\beta_{2}-9}{2(3-\beta_{2})}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a^2   = \frac{2\mu_{2}\beta_{2}}{3-\beta_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_{0} = \frac{N[\Gamma(2m+2)]}{a[2^{2m+1}][\Gamma(m+1)]}&lt;/math&gt;

The moments of ''x'' used are

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{2} = (n-1)[(n^2+n)/12]^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beta_{2}=\frac{3(25n^4-13n^3-73n^2+37n+72)}{25n(n+1)^2(n-1)}&lt;/math&gt;

==== The Pearson type III distribution ====
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda= \mu_1 + \frac{b_0}{b_1} - (m+1) b_1\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_0+b_1 (x-\lambda)\!&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Gamma}(m+1,b_1^2)\!&lt;/math&gt;
The Pearson type III distribution is a [[generalized gamma distribution]] or [[chi-squared distribution]].

==== The Pearson type V distribution ====
Defining new parameters:
:&lt;math&gt; C_1=\frac{b_1}{2 b_2}\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda=\mu_1-\frac{a-C_1} {1-2 b_2}\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x-\lambda\!&lt;/math&gt; follows an &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{InverseGamma}(\frac{1}{b_2}-1,\frac{a-C_1}{b_2})\!&lt;/math&gt;
The Pearson type V distribution is an [[inverse-gamma distribution]].

==== The Pearson type VI distribution ====
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda=\mu_1 + (a_2-a_1) \frac{m_2+1}{m_2+m_1+2} - a_2\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x-\lambda-a_2}{a_2-a_1}\!&lt;/math&gt; follows a :&lt;math&gt;\beta^{\prime}(m_2+1,-m_2-m_1-1)\!&lt;/math&gt;
The Pearson type VI distribution is a [[beta prime distribution]] or  [[F-distribution|''F''-distribution]].

== Relation to other distributions ==
The Pearson family subsumes the following distributions, among others:
* [[beta distribution]] (type I)
* [[beta prime distribution]] (type VI)
* [[Cauchy distribution]] (type IV)
* [[chi-squared distribution]] (type III)
* [[uniform distribution (continuous)|continuous uniform distribution]] (limit of type I)
* [[exponential distribution]] (type III)
* [[gamma distribution]] (type III)
* [[F-distribution|''F''-distribution]] (type VI)
* [[inverse-chi-squared distribution]] (type V)
* [[inverse-gamma distribution]] (type V)
* [[normal distribution]] (limit of type I, III, IV, V, or VI)
* [[Student's t-distribution|Student's ''t''-distribution]] (type VII, which is the non-skewed subtype of type IV)

== Applications ==
These models are used in financial markets, given their ability to be parametrised in a way that has intuitive meaning for market traders.  A number of models are in current use that capture the stochastic nature of the volatility of rates, stocks etc {{which|date=February 2018}} {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. and this family of distributions may prove to be one of the more important.

In the United States, the Log-Pearson III is the default distribution for flood frequency analysis{{fact|date=October 2018}}.

A '''personality test''' is a method of assessing human personality constructs. Most personality assessment instruments (despite being loosely referred to as "personality tests") are in fact introspective (i.e., subjective) self-report [[questionnaire]] (Q-data) measures or reports from life records (L-data) such as rating scales.&lt;ref&gt;Cattell R.B. (1973). ''Personality and Mood by Questionnaire''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. {{ISBN|0-87589-181-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R.B., &amp; Kline, P. (1977). ''The Scientific Analysis of Personality and Motivation''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to construct actual performance tests of personality have been very limited even though [[Raymond Cattell]] with his colleague Frank Warburton compiled a list of over 2000 separate objective tests that could be used in constructing objective personality tests.&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R.B., &amp; Warburton, F.W. (1967). ''Objective Personality and Motivation Tests: A Theoretical Introduction and practical Compendium''. Champaign, IL: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; One exception however, was the Objective-Analytic Test Battery, a performance test designed to quantitatively measure 10 factor-analytically discerned personality trait dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R.B., &amp; Schuerger, J.M. (1978). ''Personality Theory in Action: Handbook for the O-A (Objective-Analytic) Test Kit''.

Los Angeles, CA: Sage Publishers. {{ISBN|9-781412-946520}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major problem with both L-data and Q-data methods is that because of item transparency, rating scales and self-report questionnaires are highly susceptible to motivational and response distortion ranging all the way from lack of adequate self-insight (or biased perceptions of others) to downright dissimulation (faking good/faking bad) depending on the reason/motivation for the assessment being undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J.

The first personality assessment measures were developed in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saccuzzo|first1=, Dennis P.|last2=Kaplan|first2=Robert M.|title=Psychological Testing: Principles, Applications, and Issues|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0495095559|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were intended to ease the process of personnel selection, particularly in the armed forces. Since these early efforts, a wide variety of personality scales and questionnaires have been developed, including the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI), the [[Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire]] (16PF), the [[Comrey Personality Scales]] (CPS), among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J., Matthews, G., &amp; Saklofske, D.H.

(Eds.), ''The SAGE Handbook of Personality Theory and Assessment: Vol. 2 - Personality Measurement and Testing''. Los Angeles, CA: Sage Publishers. {{ISBN|9-781412-946520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although popular especially among personnel consultants, the [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator]] (MBTI) has numerous psychometric deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J. (1995). Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI): Some psychometric limitations. ''Australian Psychologist, 30'', 71-74.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a number of instruments based on the [[Big Five personality traits|Five Factor Model]] of personality have been constructed such as the [[Revised NEO Personality Inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;Costa, P.T., &amp; McCrae, R.R. (1985). ''The NEO Personality Inventory Manual''. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] and related [[Five Factor Model]] have been challenged for accounting for less than two-thirds of the known trait variance in the normal personality sphere alone.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J. (2008). Critique of Five-Factor Model (FFM). In G.J. Boyle, G. Matthews, &amp; D.H. Saklofske.

Estimates of how much the personality assessment industry in the US is worth range anywhere from $2 and $4 billion a year (as of 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Personality Testing at Work: Emotional Breakdown|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21575817-can-leaders-be-identified-psychometrics-emotional-breakdown|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Personality assessment is used in wide a range of contexts, including individual and [[relationship counseling]], [[clinical psychology]], [[forensic psychology]], [[school psychology]], [[career counseling]], [[employment testing]], [[occupational health and safety]] and [[customer relationship management]].

==History==
[[Image:Physiognomy.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration in a 19th-century book depicting physiognomy.]]
The origins of personality assessment date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when personality was assessed through [[phrenology]], the measurement of bumps on the human skull, and [[physiognomy]], which assessed personality based on a person's outer appearances.&lt;ref name="psychassess"/&gt; Sir Francis Galton took another approach to assessing personality late in the 19th century. Based on the lexical hypothesis, Galton estimated the number of adjectives that described personality in the English dictionary&lt;ref name="Goldberg, L.R. 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldberg | first1 = L.R. | year = 1993 | title = The structure of phenotypic personality traits | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 26–34 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.48.1.26 | pmid=8427480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galton's list was eventually refined by [[Louis Leon Thurstone]] to 60 words that were commonly used for describing personality at the time.&lt;ref name="Goldberg, L.R. 1993"/&gt; Through factor analyzing responses from 1300 participants, Thurstone was able to reduce this severely restricted pool of 60 adjectives into seven common factors.&lt;ref&gt;Thurstone, L. L. (1947). ''Multiple Factor Analysis''. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg, L.R. 1993"/&gt; This procedure of factor analyzing common adjectives was later utilized by [[Raymond Cattell]] (7th most highly cited psychologist of the 20th Century—based on the peer-reviewed journal literature),&lt;ref&gt;Haggbloom, S.J., Warnick, R., Warnick, J.E., Jones, V.K., Yarbrough, G.L., Russell, T.M., Borecky, C.M., McGahhey, R., Powell III, J.L., Beavers, J., &amp; Monte, E. (2002). The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century. ''Review of General Psychology, 6'', 139-152. doi: 10.1037//1089-2680.6.2.139&lt;/ref&gt; who subsequently utilized a data set of over 4000 affect terms from the English dictionary that eventually resulted in construction of the [[Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire]] (16PF) which also measured up to eight second-stratum personality factors.&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R.B., &amp; Nichols, K.E. (1972). An improved definition, from 10 researches, of second order personality factors in Q data (with cross-cultural checks). ''Journal of Social Psychology, 86'', 187-203.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the many introspective (ie. subjective) self-report instruments constructed to measure the putative Big Five personality dimensions, perhaps the most popular has been the [[Revised NEO Personality Inventory]] (NEO-PI-R)&lt;ref name="Goldberg, L.R. 1993"/&gt; However, it should be noted that the psychometric properties of the NEO-PI-R (including its factor analytic/construct validity) has been severely criticized.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J., Stankov, L., &amp; Cattell, R.B. (1995). Measurement and statistical models in the study of personality and intelligence.  In D.H. Saklofske &amp; M. Zeidner (Eds.), ''International Handbook of Personality and Intelligence'' (pp. 417-446). New York: Plenum. {{ISBN|0-306-44749-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early personality instrument was the [[Woodworth Personal Data Sheet]], a [[self-report inventory]] developed for [[World War I]] and used for the psychiatric screening of new draftees.&lt;ref name="psychassess"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elahe Nezami|author2=James N. Butcher|editor=G. Goldstein|editor2=Michel Hersen|title=Handbook of Psychological Assessment|date=16 February 2000|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-054002-3|page=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There are many different types of personality assessment measures. The [[self-report inventory]] involves administration of many items requiring respondents to introspectively assess their own personality characteristics. This is highly subjective, and because of item transparency, such Q-data measures are highly susceptible to motivational and response distortion.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J. (1985). Self-report measures of depression: Some psychometric considerations. ''British Journal of Clinical Psychology, 24'', 45-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Respondents are required to indicate their level of agreement with each item using a [[Likert scale]] or, more accurately, a Likert-type scale. An item on a personality questionnaire, for example, might ask respondents to rate the degree to which they agree with the statement "I talk to a lot of different people at parties" on a scale from 1 ("strongly disagree") to 5 ("strongly agree").

Historically, the most widely used multidimensional personality instrument is the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI), a psychopathology instrument originally designed to assess archaic psychiatric [[nosology]].&lt;ref&gt;Helmes, E., &amp; Reddon, J.R. (1993). A perspective on developments in assessing psychopathology: A critical review of the MMPI and MMPI-2. ''Psychological Bulletin, 113'', 453-471.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson [et al.]|first=Neil, R.|title=Psychology: the Science of Behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Person Education|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|pages=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to subjective/introspective self-report inventories, there are several other methods for assessing human personality, including observational measures, ratings of others, projective tests (e.g., the [[Thematic Apperception Test|TAT]] and [[Rorschach inkblot test|Ink Blots]]), and actual objective performance tests (T-data).

== Topics ==

===Norms===
The meaning of ''personality test'' scores are difficult to interpret in a direct sense. For this reason substantial effort is made by producers of personality tests to produce norms to provide a comparative basis for interpreting a respondent's test scores. Common formats for these norms include [[percentile]] ranks, [[standard score|z scores]], [[sten scores]], and other forms of standardised scores.

===Test development===
A substantial amount of research and thinking has gone into the topic of ''personality test'' development. Development of personality tests tends to be an iterative process whereby a test is progressively refined. Test development can proceed on theoretical or statistical grounds. There are three commonly used general strategies: Inductive, Deductive, and Empirical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burisch|first=Matthias|title=Approaches to personality inventory construction: A comparison of merits|journal=American Psychologist|date=March 1984|volume=39|issue=3|pages=214–227|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.39.3.214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scales created today will often incorporate elements of all three methods.

Deductive assessment construction begins by selecting a domain or construct to measure.&lt;ref name="Burisch, M. 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burisch | first1 = M | year = 1984 | title = Approaches to personality inventory construction: A comparison of merits | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 214–227 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.39.3.214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construct is thoroughly defined by experts and items are created which fully represent all the attributes of the construct definition.&lt;ref name="Burisch, M. 1984"/&gt; Test items are then selected or eliminated based upon which will result in the strongest internal validity for the scale. Measures created through deductive methodology are equally valid and take significantly less time to construct compared to inductive and empirical measures. The clearly defined and face valid questions that result from this process make them easy for the person taking the assessment to understand. Although subtle items can be created through the deductive process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = D. N. | year = 1971 | title = The dynamics of structured personality tests: 1971 | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 78 | issue = 3| pages = 229–248 | doi=10.1037/h0030852}}&lt;/ref&gt; these measure often are not as capable of detecting lying as other methods of personality assessment construction.&lt;ref name="Burisch, M. 1984"/&gt;

Inductive assessment construction begins with the creation of a multitude of diverse items.The items created for an inductive measure to not intended to represent any theory or construct in particular. Once the items have been created they are administered to a large group of participants. This allows researchers to analyze natural relationships among the questions and label components of the scale based upon how the questions group together. Several statistical techniques can be used to determine the constructs assessed by the measure. Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis are two of the most common data reduction techniques that allow researchers to create scales from responses on the initial items.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The [[Five Factor Model]] of personality was developed using this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCrae|first=Robert|author2=Oliver John|title=An Introduction to the Five-Factor Model and Its Applications|journal=Journal of Personality|year=1992|volume=60|issue=2|pages=175–215|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1992.tb00970.x|pmid=1635039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced statistical methods include the opportunity to discover previously unidentified or unexpected relationships between items or constructs. It also may allow for the development of subtle items that prevent test takers from knowing what is being measured and may represent the actual structure of a construct better than a pre-developed theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Greggory|author2=Sarah Fischer |author3=Suzannah Fister |title=Incremental Validity Principles in Test Construction|journal=Psychological Assessment|date=December 2003|volume=15|issue=4|pages=467–477|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.15.4.467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms include a vulnerability to finding item relationships that do not apply to a broader population, difficulty identifying what may be measured in each component because of confusing item relationships, or constructs that were not fully addressed by the originally created questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryan Joseph|title=Understanding Psychological Assessment: Perspective on Individual Differences|year=2001|publisher=Springer|pages=1–15|edition=1|authorlink=Understanding Test Construction|author2=Shane Lopez |author3=Scott Sumerall |editor=William Dorfman, Michel Hersen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirically derived personality assessments require statistical techniques. One of the central goals of empirical personality assessment is to create a test that validly discriminates between two distinct dimensions of personality. Empirical tests can take a great deal of time to construct. In order to ensure that the test is measuring what it is purported to measure, psychologists first collect data through self- or observer reports, ideally from a large number of participants.

=== Self- vs. observer-reports ===
A personality test can be administered directly to the person being evaluated or to an observer. In a self-report, the individual responds to personality items as they pertain to the person himself/herself. Self-reports are commonly used. In an observer-report, a person responds to the personality items as those items pertain to someone else. To produce the most accurate results, the observer needs to know the individual being evaluated. Combining the scores of a self-report and an observer report can reduce error, providing a more accurate depiction of the person being evaluated. Self- and observer-reports tend to yield similar results, supporting their validity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987583452|title=Individual Differences and Personality|last=C.,|first=Ashton, Michael|isbn=9780128098455|edition=3rd|oclc=987583452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct observation reports===
Direct observation involves a second party directly observing and evaluating someone else. The second party observes how the target of the observation behaves in certain situations (e.g., how a child behaves in a schoolyard during recess). The observations can take place in a natural (e.g., a schoolyard) or artificial setting (social psychology laboratory). Direct observation can help identify job applicants (e.g., work samples&lt;ref&gt;[http://hr.ucdavis.edu/recruitment/selection/work-samples.html Human Resources]&lt;/ref&gt;) who are likely to be successful or maternal attachment in young children (e.g., [[Mary Ainsworth]]'s [[strange situation]]). The object of the method is to directly observe ''genuine'' behaviors in the target. A limitation of direct observation is that the target persons may change their behavior because they know that they are being observed.&lt;ref&gt;Schonfeld, I.S., &amp; Mazzola, J.J. (2013). Strengths and limitations of qualitative approaches to research in occupational health psychology. In R. Sinclair, M. Wang, &amp; L. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Research methods in occupational health psychology: State of the art in measurement, design, and data analysis'' (pp. 268-289). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; A second limitation is that some behavioral traits are more difficult to observe (e.g., sincerity) than others (e.g., sociability). A third limitation is that direct observation is more expensive and time consuming than a number of other methods (e.g., [[self-report study|self-report]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Personality tests in the workplace ===
Personality tests can predict something about how a job applicant will act in some workplace situations.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Conscientiousness is one of the [[big five personality traits]]. A person is high in conscientiousness will ordinarily be less likely to commit crimes (e.g., stealing property) against the employer.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} People who are higher in the agreeableness trait tend to be less likely to fight or argue with other employees.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} There is a chance that an applicant may fake responses to personality test items in order to make the applicant appear more attractive to the employing organization than the individual actually is.&lt;ref&gt;Ones, D.S. (2009). Personality at work: Raising awareness and correcting misconceptions. ''Human Performance, 18'', 389-404. doi:10.1207/s15327043hup1804_5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test evaluation===
There are several criteria for evaluating a ''personality test''. For a test to be successful, users need to be sure that (a) test results are replicable and (b) the test measures what its creators purport it to measure. Fundamentally, a ''personality test'' is expected to demonstrate [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[Test validity|validity]]. Reliability refers to the extent to which test scores, if a test were administered to a sample twice within a short period of time, would be similar in both administrations. Test validity refers to evidence that a test measures the [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]] (e.g., neuroticism) that it is supposed to measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Urbina|first1=Susana|title=Essentials of Psychological Testing|date=2014-06-30|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated|location=Hoboken. New Jersey|isbn=978-1-118-70725-8|pages=127–128, 165–167|edition=Second|url=https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libproxy.mst.edu/lib/umr-ebooks/reader.action?docID=1727717&amp;ppg=1|accessdate=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===
A respondent's response is used to compute the analysis. Analysis of data is a long process. Two major theories are used here; Classical test theory (CTT)- used for the observed score,&lt;ref&gt;(see Lord and Novick, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; and item response theory (IRT)- "a family of models for persons' responses to items".&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman J. Adèr]], [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh]] (2008) ''Advising on Research Methods: a consultant's companion''. Johannes van Kessel Publ. p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Hamleton and Swaminathon (1985) for a full summary of IRT&lt;/ref&gt; The two theories focus upon different 'levels' of responses and researchers are implored to use both in order to fully appreciate their results.

===Non-response===
Firstly, item non-response needs to be addressed. Non-response can either be 'unit'- where a person gave no response for any of the n items, or 'item'- i.e., individual question. Unit non-response is generally dealt with exclusion.&lt;ref name="Mellenbergh, 2008"&gt;(Mellenbergh, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Item non-response should be handled by imputation- the method used can vary between test and questionnaire items. Literature about the most appropriate method to use and when can be found here.&lt;ref&gt;(Ader, Mellenbergh &amp; Hand, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scoring===
The conventional method of scoring items is to assign '0' for an incorrect answer '1' for a correct answer. When tests have more response options (e.g. multiple choice items) '0' when incorrect, '1' for being partly correct and '2' for being correct.&lt;ref name="Mellenbergh, 2008"/&gt; Personality tests can also be scored using a dimensional (normative) or a typological (ipsative) approach. Dimensional approaches such as the Big 5 describe personality as a set of continuous dimensions on which individuals differ. From the item scores, an 'observed' score is computed. This is generally found by summing the un-weighted item scores.

==Criticism and controversy==

===Biased test taker interpretation===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
One problem of a personality test is that the users of the test could only find it accurate because of the subjective validation involved. Users of personality tests have to assume that the subjective responses that are given by participants on such tests, represent the actual personality of those participants. Also, one must assume that personality is a reliable, constant part of the human mind or behaviour.

===Personality versus social factors===
{{more citations needed|date=March 2015}}
In the 60s and 70s some psychologists dismissed the whole idea of personality, considering much behaviour to be context-specific.&lt;ref name="Doll1953"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bRY8AAAAIAAJ|title=The measurement of social competence: a manual for the Vineland social maturity scale|last=Doll|first=Edgar Arnold|publisher=Educational Test Bureau, Educational Publishers|year=1953|doi=10.1037/11349-000}} archived at [https://archive.org/details/measurementofsoc1953doll]&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was supported by the fact that personality often does not predict behaviour in specific contexts. However, more extensive research has shown that when behaviour is aggregated across contexts, that personality can be a modest to good predictor of behaviour. Almost all psychologists now acknowledge that both social and individual difference factors (i.e., personality) influence behaviour. The debate is currently more around the relative importance of each of these factors and how these factors interact.

===Respondent faking===
{{more citations needed|date=May 2014}}
One problem with self-report measures of personality is that respondents are often able to distort their responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arendasy|first=M. |author2=Sommer, Herle |author3=Schutzhofer, Inwanschitz|title=Modeling effects of faking on an objective personality test.|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|year=2011|volume=32|issue=4|pages=210–218|doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotive tests in particular could in theory become prey to unreliable results due to people striving to pick the answer they feel the best fitting of an ideal character and therefore not their true response. This is particularly problematic in employment contexts and other contexts where important decisions are being made and there is an incentive to present oneself in a favourable manner.

Work in experimental settings&lt;ref&gt;(e.g., Viswesvaran &amp; Ones, 1999; Martin, Bowen &amp; Hunt, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; has also shown that when student samples have been asked to deliberately fake on a personality test, they clearly demonstrated that they are capable of doing so.
Hogan, Barett and Hogan (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Joyce|title=Personality Measurement, Faking, and Employment Selection|url=http://filebox.vt.edu/r/rammu/Research%20Methods%20Articles/Hogan.pdf|publisher=American Psychological Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605085027/http://filebox.vt.edu/r/rammu/Research%20Methods%20Articles/Hogan.pdf|archivedate=2013-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  analyzed data of 5,266 applicants who did a personality test based on the big five. At the first application the applicants were rejected. After six months the applicants reapplied and completed the same personality test. The answers on the personality tests were compared and there was no significant difference between the answers.

So in practice, most people do not significantly distort. Nevertheless, a researcher has to be prepared for such possibilities. Also, sometimes participants think that tests results are more valid than they really are because they like the results that they get. People want to believe that the positive traits that the test results say they possess are in fact present in their personality. This leads to distorted results of people's sentiments on the validity of such tests.

Several strategies have been adopted for reducing respondent faking. One strategy involves providing a warning on the test that methods exist for detecting faking and that detection will result in negative consequences for the respondent (e.g., not being considered for the job). Forced choice item formats ([[ipsative]] testing) have been adopted which require respondents to choose between alternatives of equal social desirability. Social desirability and lie scales are often included which detect certain patterns of responses, although these are often confounded by true variability in social desirability.

More recently, [[Item Response Theory]] approaches have been adopted with some success in identifying item response profiles that flag fakers. Other researchers are looking at the timing of responses on electronically administered tests to assess faking. While people can fake in practice they seldom do so to any significant level. To successfully fake means knowing what the ideal answer would be. Even with something as simple as assertiveness people who are unassertive and try to appear assertive often endorse the wrong items. This is because unassertive people confuse assertion with aggression, anger, oppositional behavior, etc.

===Psychological research===
Research on the importance of personality and intelligence in education shows evidence that when others provide the personality rating, rather than providing a self-rating, the outcome is nearly four times more accurate for predicting grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Other-rated personality and academic performance: Evidence and implications|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1043498 |journal = Learning and Individual Differences|date = 2014-08-01|pages = 24–32|volume = 34|doi = 10.1016/j.lindif.2014.05.013|first = Arthur E.|last = Poropat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional applications===
A study by American Management Association reveals that 39 percent of companies surveyed use personality testing as part of their hiring process. However, [[ipsative]] personality tests are often misused in recruitment and selection, where they are mistakenly treated as if they were [[Norm-referenced test|normative]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blinkhorn | first1 = S. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = C. | last3 = Wood | first3 = R. | year = 1988 | title = Spuriouser and spuriouser:The use of ipsative personality tests | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational. Psychology | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 153–162 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More people are using personality testing to evaluate their business partners, their dates and their spouses. [[Sales]]people are using personality testing to better understand the needs of their customers and to gain a competitive edge in the closing of deals. [[College]] students have started to use personality testing to evaluate their roommates. [[Lawyer]]s are beginning to use personality testing for [[criminal]] behavior analysis, [[litigation]] profiling, witness examination and jury selection.

===Dangers===
{{more citations needed|date=May 2014}}
Personality tests have been around for a long time, but it wasn't until it became illegal for employers to use polygraphs that we began to see the widespread use of personality tests. The idea behind these personality tests is that employers can reduce their turnover rates and prevent economic losses in the form of people prone to thievery, drug abuse, emotional disorders or violence in the workplace.

Employers may also view personality tests as more accurate assessment of a candidate's behavioral characteristics versus an employment reference. But the problem with using personality tests as a hiring tool is the notion a person's [[job performance]] in one environment will carry over to another work environment. However, the reality is that one's environment plays a crucial role in determining job performance, and not all environments are created equally. One danger of using personality tests is the results may be skewed based on a person's mood so good candidates may potentially be screened out because of unfavorable responses that reflect that mood.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Another danger of personality tests is that they can create false-negative results (i.e. honest people being labeled as dishonest) especially in cases when stress on the applicant's part is involved. There is also the issue of privacy to be of concern forcing applicants to reveal private thoughts and feelings through his or her responses that seem to become a condition for employment. Another danger of personality tests is the illegal discrimination of certain groups under the guise of a personality test.&lt;ref name="Stabile"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stabile|first=Susan J.|title=The Use of Personality Tests as a Hiring Tool: Is the Benefit Worth the Cost?|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jbl/articles/volume4/issue2/Stabile4U.Pa.J.Lab.&amp;Emp.L.279(2002).pdf|publisher=U.PA.

=== Personality tests of the five factor model ===
Different types of the [[Big Five personality traits]]:

* The NEO PI-R, or the [[Revised NEO Personality Inventory]], is one of the most significant measures of the Five Factor Model (FFM). The measure was created by Costa and McCrae and contains 240 items in the forms of sentences. Costa and McCrae had divided each of the five domains into six facets each, 30 facets total, and changed the way the FFM is measured.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, P. T., Jr., &amp; McCrae, R. R. (1992). Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R) and NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) professional manual. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Five-Factor Model Rating Form (FFMRF) was developed by Lynam and Widiger in 2001 as a shorter alternative to the NEO PI-R. The form consists of 30 facets, 6 facets for each of the Big Five factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynam | first1 = D. R. | last2 = Widiger | first2 = T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16479">The '''person–situation debate''' in [[personality psychology]] refers to the controversy concerning whether the person or the situation is more influential in determining a person's [[behavior]]. [[Personality trait]] psychologists believe that people have consistent personalities that guide their behaviors across situations. [[Situationism (psychology)|Situationists]], opponents of the trait approach, argue that people are not consistent enough from situation to situation to be characterized by broad personality traits.

==Background==

Interest in determining whether there were any generalities in behavior began in the 1920s and 30s.&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;Epstein, S. &amp; O'Brien, E.J. (1985). The Person-Situation Debate in Historical and Current Perspective. ''Psychological Bulletin, 98'' (3), 513–537.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] and [[Henry Murray]] both supported the idea of a consistent personality with occasional situational influences.&lt;ref name=Hogan&gt;Hogan, R. (2009). Much ado about nothing: The person-situation debate. ''Journal of Research in personality, 43'' 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Allport noted that "traits become predictable to the extent that identities in stimulus situations are predictable."&lt;ref name=Allport&gt;Allport, G. W. (1927). Concepts of trait and personality. ''Psychological Bulletin, 24''(5), 284–293. doi:10.1037/h0073629&lt;/ref&gt; Others like [[Edward Thorndike]] viewed behavior as a composition of responses an individual has to situations.&lt;ref name=Epstein /&gt;

In 1968, [[Walter Mischel]] published a book called ''Personality and Assessment'' claiming that behavior is too cross-situationally inconsistent to be classified with personality traits. He stated:

"...with the possible exception of intelligence, highly generalised behavioral consistencies have not been demonstrated, and the concept of personality traits as broad dispositions is thus untenable"&lt;ref name="Mischel1968"&gt;Mischel, Walter. (1968). ''Personality and Assessment'', London, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|146}}

His book was a non-systematic meta-analysis of some of the research on the relationship between behavioral and personality traits (assessed by either self-report or peer-report). The book also assessed studies regarding measurements of behavior from one situation to another.&lt;ref name=Funder /&gt; This book generated a formidable dispute between [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] and [[Trait theory|trait theorists]] because trait questionnaires had been used to measure personality for many decades.  Behaviorism had dominated the field of psychology up until this time, making Mischel's claim devastating to the mainstream consensus amongst personality psychologists and causing many psychologists to question and doubt whether personality exists.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

According to [[David C. Funder]], Mischel's book posed three main questions: 
*Is personality consistent and does it overcome situational influences? 
*Are people's intuitions about each other's personalities generally flawed or generally correct?
*If personality is really that consistent, why are psychologists continuing to argue about this issue?&lt;ref name=Funder /&gt;

More recently, Mischel has retracted some of his original claims, protesting that some psychologists misinterpreted his argument to mean he believes personality does not exist.&lt;ref name=Mischel&amp;Shoda&gt;Mischel, W. &amp; Shoda, Y. (1995). A cognitive-affective system theory of personality: Reconceptualizing situations, dispositions, dynamics, and invariance in personality structure. ''Psychological Review, 102,'' 246–268.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Situationist argument==

Situationists had a number of arguments, but they can be generally summarized into four:&lt;ref name=Funder&gt;Funder, D.C. (2010). The Personality Puzzle. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Roberts, B.W. (2009). Back to the future: ''Personality and Assessment'' and personality development, ''Journal of Research in Personality 43''. 137–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Low correlations between measures of behavior and personality: In psychological research, whether relationships between variables exist are compared by the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]].  Mischel argued that in his literature review of personality research, the [[correlation]] between personality and behavior, or behavior across situations, rarely exceeded .30-.40. Because the correlations are close to zero, Mischel concluded that personality traits have little to no relationship to shaping behavior. This claim was especially detrimental to personality psychology and continues to haunt many fields of psychology research today.&lt;ref name="Epstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Funder /&gt;&lt;ref name=Roberts /&gt;
# The validity of self-report measures and clinical assessment procedures: Most of the studies that Mischel reviewed had taken place in laboratory settings. Rarely was behavior analyzed in natural settings. The claim was that trait psychologists did not adequately combat issues of method variance,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D. T, &amp; Fiske, D. W. (1959). Convergent and discriminant validation by the multitrait-multimethod matrix. ''Psychological Bulletin,'' 56, 81–105.&lt;/ref&gt; social desirability and response sets,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, A. L. (1957). The social desirability variable in personality assessment and research. New York: Dryden Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and construct validity&lt;ref&gt;Cronbach, L. J., &amp; Meehl, P. E. (1955). Construct validity in psychological tests. ''Psychological Bulletin, 52,'' 281–302.&lt;/ref&gt; when they constructed their measures of traits. The practical utility of trait measurements in predicting behavior was also questioned.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt; Even when observation studies were conducted, there was observer bias (that is, traits are in the eye of the beholder).&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;
# The type of behavioral assessment and treatment procedures that were becoming popular at the time: These treatments and behavioral assessment methods focused on the situational influences on behavior, rather than personality traits.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1967). Behavioral psychotherapy. ''Scientific American,'' 216, 78–86.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Stability: behavior is not cross-situationally consistent, and any stability can be attributed to the consistency of the situation, not the person. Situationists questioned whether personality traits exist when behaviors are not consistent across situations; after all, why spend time studying a construct that has no validity?&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

Because of the aforementioned points, situationists argued that the predictive ability of personality traits is severely lacking. Opponents of the trait approach claimed that the idea of personality traits is fundamentally flawed and that behavior would be better understood through conditioning and learning processes.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Funder/&gt;

==Responses==
Over time, personality psychologists have formed rebuttals to Mischel's criticisms. According to Funder, Mischel's analysis was quite short (only 16 pages), and therefore was not comprehensive of the personality literature available at the time.&lt;ref name=Funder/&gt; With a fair review of the literature, the predictability of behavior from traits may be larger than what researchers previously assumed.

Improved research methods can increase the predictability. The situationist argument was formed based on research studies that were conducted in laboratory situations, and therefore did not reflect behavior in real life. When studying behaviors in a more natural setting, personality is likely to influence behavior. According to Allport, personality will be more likely to exhibit greater apparent effects in real situations that are important and influential to the individual being observed.&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G.W. (1961). ''Pattern and growth in personality.'' New York: Holt, Rinehart.&lt;/ref&gt;

Predictability can also be influenced depending on what is being measured, and some behaviors may be more consistent than others. For example, the amount a person gestures or the volume of a person's voice are more likely to be consistent across situations than goal-directed behaviors, such as when a person is trying to impress another person.&lt;ref&gt;Funder, D.C., &amp; Colvin, C.R. (1991). Explorations in behavioral consistency: Properties of persons, situations, and behaviors. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60,'' 773–794.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G.W., &amp; Vernon, P.E. (1933). ''Studies in expressive movement.'' New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

It may also be that on average, individuals act consistently, and therefore personality research may be more telling as general behavioral trends than specific instances. This is evident in when people are interested in personalities of others, they are more interested in how others will generally act, not one specific behavior at a specific time.&lt;ref&gt;McCrae, R.R. (2002). The maturation of personality psychology: Adult personality development and psychological well-being. ''Journal of Research in Personality, 36,'' 307–317.&lt;/ref&gt;

A correlation of .40 is not that small of a correlation and can explain more variance than most people think. Correlation  coefficients of the effects found in studies of personality variables cannot be comparable with effects found in studies of situational variables because the two styles of research do not employ a common metric.  After converting the statistics that social psychologists use in analyzing situation variables and behavior into correlations used by personality psychologists in analyzing trait variables and behavior, Funder and [[Daniel J. Ozer]] found that the correlations between situations and behaviors are also around the .30–.40 range.&lt;ref&gt;Funder, D.C., &amp; Ozer, D.J. (1983). Behavior as a function of the situation. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 44,'' 107–112.&lt;/ref&gt; After conversion, it was found that even well-respected studies, like the one conducted by [[Stanley Milgram]] on obedience that used fake electric shocks to study how people react to being asked to cause harm to others ([[Milgram Experiment]]), found correlations of situations and behaviors to be around .40.&lt;ref&gt;Milgram, S. (1975). ''Obedience to authority.'' New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, survey studies that compare the effects of situational variables on behavior show that the correlation between situation and behavior are also around the .30–.40 range.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Funder/&gt; [[Seymour Epstein]] found that if the behaviors were aggregated over time, the cross situational consistency of behaviors is much higher.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, S. (1979). The stability of behavior: I. On predicting most of the people much of the time. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37, 1097–1126.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in highly controlled studies, cross-situational consistency is around the .40 range.&lt;ref&gt;Borkenau, P., Mauer, N., Riemann, R., Spinath, F. M., &amp; Angleitner, A. (2004). Thin slices of behavior as cues of personality and intelligence. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 86,'' 599–614.&lt;/ref&gt;

Personality traits are important because personality traits exist. The field of personality psychology gained attention when Allport had his assistant, [[Henry Odbert]], count how many different words in the English dictionary could be used to describe differences in personality. Odbert reported 17, 953.&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G.W., &amp; Odbert, H.S. (1936). Trait-names: A psycho-lexical study. ''Psychological Monographs: General and Applied, 47''(1, Whole No. 211), 171–220.&lt;/ref&gt; With such a large number of words that are related to personality trait differences, Allport and Odbert proposed the [[Lexical hypothesis]], or the theory that traits are obviously an important part of how people think and talk about each other, or else it would not be a part of the language. Words that make people more sensitive to individual differences are continuing to be created and formed today.&lt;ref name=Funder /&gt;

==Current directions==
Mischel's book raised important questions about trait concepts and measures in psychological research. Researchers like [[Douglas Kenrick]] and Funder note that controversy is beneficial to scientific research because it helps narrow down competing hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, D.T. &amp; Funder, D.C. (1988). Profiting from Controversy: Lessons from the Person-Situation Debate. ''American Psychologist, 43'' (1), 23–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most personality researchers have now concluded that both the person and the situation contribute to behavior. Specifically, situational variables are more conclusive when it comes to predicting behavior in specific situations, while traits are more descriptive of patterns of behavior that influence behavior across situations.&lt;ref&gt;Fleeson, W. (2001). Toward a structure- and process-integrated view of personality: Traits as density distribution of states. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 80,'' 1011–1027.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have also suggested the possibility of situational factors (like social roles) eliciting situation-specific goals which then influence the development of personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, D., Perunovic, W. Q. E., Reichman, D. (2009). The future of person-situation integration in the interface between traits and goals: A bottom-up framework. ''Journal of Research in Personality, 43,'' 171–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interactionism===
The [[interactionism]] perspective recognizes that the effect of personality depends on the situation and that situations are affected by the personalities of the people who are present. Interactionism also recognizes that people often choose situations that reflect their personalities.&lt;ref name=Funder/&gt; One of the many interactionism researchers, [[Allan R. Buss]], introduced the idea that persons and situations interact in three different ways: 
*The effect of personality on behavior depends on the situation and vice versa
*Certain people typically find themselves in certain situations, depending on their personality
*People change situations by how they act and what they do in these situations.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, A.R. (1977). The trait-situation controversy and the concept of interaction. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 5,'' 191-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly used example of person-situation interaction is the [[Stanford prison experiment]], where college students participated in a study that simulated a prison setting with some students acting as guards and others as prisoners. The study was terminated when the guards became even more abusive than anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;Haney, C., Banks., C., &amp; Zimbardo, P. (1973). Interpersonal dynamics in a simulated prison. ''International Journal of Criminology and Penology, 1,'' 69–97.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Philip Zimbardo]] concluded that the study shows evidence of the effect of the situation transcending personality traits, more recent studies show that these students were drawn to participate in a study of "prison life" because of their personality characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Carnahan, T., &amp; McFarland, S. (2007). Revisiting the Stanford Prison Experiment: Could participant self-selection have led to the cruelty? ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 33,'' 603–614.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthesis===
Recently, personality psychologists William Fleeson and Erik Noftle have suggested that the person-situation debate ended in a [[thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]]. According to them, there is more than one type of behavior consistency. Traits are not robustly predictive of cross-situational consistency, but rather, predictive of consistency for a wide distribution of behaviors over time.&lt;ref&gt;Fleeson, W., &amp; Noftle, E. E. (2009). The end of the person-situation debate: an emerging synthesis in the answer to the consistency question. ''Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 2'' (4), 1667–1684.&lt;/ref&gt; Fleeson has also proposed that traits can be better understood as density distributions of behaviors.  He posited that an individual has an anchor mean level of a trait, but the individual's behavior can vary around this mean depending on situations. Therefore, this distribution could account for the low cross-situational consistency of single acts of behavior while also explaining the high consistency of behaviors over time.

A '''polar concept argument''' is a type of [[argument]] that posits the understanding of one concept, from the mere understanding of its [[wikt:polar opposite|polar opposite]]. A well-known instance of a polar concept argument is [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s argument against scepticism (1960). According to Anthony Grayling's characterisation, Ryle's argument can be stated as follows:

:''There cannot be counterfeit coins, (...) unless there are genuine ones, nor crooked paths unless there are straight paths, nor tall men unless there are short men''.

According to Ryle's polar concept argument, counterfeit and genuine coins come in pairs, and one cannot conceive of counterfeit coins without also capturing the essence of the genuine coins at the same time. When one grasps the essence of one polar concept, one also grasps immediately the essence of its polar opposite. Ryle's original argument (1960) runs as follows:

:''A country which had no coinage would offer no scope to counterfeiters. There would be nothing for them to manufacture or pass counterfeits of. They could, if they wished, manufacture and give away decorated disks of brass or lead, which the public might be pleased to get. But these would not be false coins. There can be false coins only where there are coins made of the proper materials by the proper authorities. In a country where there is a coinage, false coins can be manufactured and passed; and the counterfeiting might be so efficient that an ordinary citizen, unable to tell which were false and which were genuine coins, might become suspicious of the genuineness of any particular coin that he received.''

A polar concept argument bears on some more or less strong version of [[dialectical monism]], a philosophical doctrine that views reality as a unified whole, due to the complementarity of [[polar concepts]].

Power-control theory differs from other control theories that view crime as a cause of low [[social status]] (cited from book). This theory compares gender and parental control mechanisms in two different types of families; patriarchal and egalitarian to explain the differences in self-reported male and female misconduct. In patriarchal families, traditional gender roles were in practice, where the father would work outside the home, and the mother would be responsible for the child rearing. In egalitarian families, the household roles were shared equally between mothers and fathers.&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady 2007, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was originally posited by [[John Hagan (sociologist)|John Hagan]] and further developed by [[A. R. Gillis]] and [[John Simpson (sociologist)|John Simpson]] at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name="clarify and extend"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hagan|first1=John |first2=A. R. |last2=Gillis |first3=John |last3=Simpson|date=January 1990|title=Clarifiying and Extending Power-Control Theory|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|publisher=University of Toronto|volume= 95|issue= 4|pages=1024–1037|jstor=2780649|doi=10.1086/229384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

The power control theory was developed through a series of self-report surveys that was administered to high school students and their parents in suburban Toronto. Hagan and his colleagues contended that gender and the social class of the students' parents affected how much freedom these students had. For example, coming of age as they argued, was a more limiting experience than growing up as a male. Thereby, they found that the amount of power a parent had in the workplace was related to the control displayed in the household over their teenaged children. Moreover, parents who had the types of jobs where they must supervise the activities of subordinates also tended to be relatively tolerant of the trouble-making behaviour of their children, especially of their sons. This meant that teenaged boys are freer to deviate than teenaged girls. This study also found, focusing on relatively minor forms of deviance such as shoplifting and breaking street lights, that middle-class youth actually were freer to deviate than working-class youth.&lt;ref name="O'Grady 2007, p. 111"&gt;O'Grady 2007, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

According to Julian Tanner, he offers two interesting critical comments. Though the power control theory effectively explains common delinquency among ordinary youth, it does not explain violent and repetitive crime and, therefore, the power control theory cannot predict such behavior. In addition, the power control theory suggests that parents in egalitarian households are more likely to raise females as delinquent than a female growing up in a patriarchal family; however, UCR (uniform crime report) data shows that the opposite association exists and that the involvement in female labor force is actually related to lower levels of female delinquency. Also, after years of refining the power control theory, theorists have found the notion that mothers being more controlling over their daughters are more likely to be found in egalitarian families than patriarchal families, which is the opposite relationship the power control theory would likely predict.

When the theory was refined over the years, Singer and Levine (1988) found mixed support for the theory in their early attempts to test this theory. While mothers were seen to be more controlling over their daughters than their sons, the authors also found this to be more so with egalitarian than patriarchal families, which is a finding opposite to what power control theory would predict.&lt;ref name="O'Grady 2007, p. 111"/&gt;

==Theory extended beyond family==

The theory has been extended into adult social roles as well. Stratified behaviors typically associated with males, particularly those in authoritative positions, are now being seen more frequently in females attaining powerful roles. And like their male counterparts, their power is used to control those persons in subordinate roles, as indicated by the rise in reports of sexual harassment (cougar syndrome) and cronyism.

Despite the explanation of social roles, there has not been a feminist theory that is fully developed to explain for the uniqueness of female criminality. While males are reported to be more involved in every type of crime, females tend to be arrested for considerably minor property crimes. This is due to the idea that the character and level of female crime is not consistent with the traditional sociological explanations of crime.&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady 2007, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antoine pesne friedrich wil.jpg|thumb|300px|King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]], the "Soldier-King", first named the Prussian virtues (which were supposedly present since the [[State of the Teutonic Order]]). Painting by [[Antoine Pesne]], about 1733.]]
'''Prussian virtues''' ({{lang-de| preußische Tugenden}}) refers to the [[virtue]]s associated with the historical [[Kingdom of Prussia]], especially its [[militarism]] and the [[Warrior ethos|ethical code]] of the [[Prussian army]], but also [[bourgeois]] values as influenced by  [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]]. It has also significantly influenced wider [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], such as the contemporary German stereotypes of efficiency, austerity and discipline.

==Development==
These virtues, while traced back to the [[Teutonic Order|Teutonic knights]], were named by King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]], the "soldier{{Ndash}}king" and frugal "bourgeois" reformer of Prussian administration, as well as from his son, [[Frederick the Great]]. The father had taken over an over-indebted public budget and saw himself as a moral role model, while the son saw himself as an exemplar of reason for the religiously, ethnically, and linguistically diverse Prussian state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Graf von Krockow|Christian Graf v. Krockow]]: "Die Pflicht und das Glück" (speech on 17 August 1991 in the [[Neues Palais]], [[Potsdam]]) in: [[Hans Bentzien]]: ''Die Heimkehr der Preußenkönige'', 1. edition, Berlin 1991. {{ISBN|3-353-00877-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extended Prussian territory was home to [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] subjects, of [[German people|Germans]], [[Polish people|Poles]], [[Sorbs]] and [[Kashubians]]. Frederick William I considered himself to be a role model, while his [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]] son relied on reason and tolerance to rule his multifaceted state.

Prussia developed a highly-advanced administration and legal system, as well as a loyal officer corps and a kind of common-sense [[patriotism]] gathering the subjects behind the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] ruler. The Prussian "era of reform", from the military defeat by [[Napoleon I]] at the [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt|Battles of Jena and Auerstedt]], until the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, was also an important influence. These included reform of community boundaries, the army, schools, universities, and taxes, as well as the enfranchisement of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans-Joachim Schoeps]]: chapter "Preußische Tugenden" in ''Preußen&amp;nbsp;– Bilder und Zeugnisse'' (most recently posthumously in ''Preußen&amp;nbsp;– Geschichte eines Staates'', Frankfurt a. M./ Berlin 1995. {{ISBN|3-549-05496-3}}, pp. 442ff)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In poetry==
The German author and soldier [[Walter Flex]] (1887–1917) wrote "Wer je auf Preußens Fahne schwört, hat nichts mehr, was ihm selbst gehört."  Translation: "He who swears on Prussia's flag has nothing left that belongs to himself."&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Flex]]. "Preußischer Fahneneid" ("Prussian Military Oath" written in 1915) in ''Gesammelte Werke'' (Title Translation: ''Collected Works''), Vol. 1, pp. 73–74, quote in p. 74. This line was also served as his epitaph at his original burial site at the Dorffriedhof (Village Cemetery) of Peude (or Pöide), [[Saaremaa|Saaremaa island formerly Ösel Island]], Estonia. Lars Kich. ''Der Erste Weltkrieg als Medium der Gegenmoderne: Zu den Werken von Walter Flex und Ernst Jünger''. (Title Translation: "The First World War as a Means of Counter-Modernity: To the Works of Walter Flex and Ernst Jünger.")  Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 2006, p. 117 and p. 117 n. 544.  {{ISBN|3826031687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prussian virtues may be summarized by the opening lines of the poem "{{Lang|de|Der alte Landmann an seinen Sohn}}" ("The Old Farmer to His Son") by [[Ludwig Christoph Heinrich Hölty]] (1748–1776). The text reads as follows: "{{Lang|de|Üb' immer Treu und Redlichkeit / Bis an dein kühles Grab; / Und weiche keinen Fingerbreit / Von Gottes Wegen ab.}}" Translation: "Practice always fidelity and honesty / Until your cool grave; / And stray not the width of one finger/ From the ways of the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/H%F6lty,%20Ludwig%20Christoph%20Heinrich/Gedichte/S%E4mtliche%20Gedichte/Der%20alte%20Landmann%20an%20seinen%20Sohn "{{Lang|de|Der alte Landmann an seinen Sohn}}"], [[zeno.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The poem was set to music by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] to a melody adapted from the aria "{{Lang|de|Ein Mädchen oder Weibchen}}" from his 1791 opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''. It was played daily by the carillon of the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Potsdam Garrison Church]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/andruck/1271662/ "{{Lang|de|Moral ohne Anstand}}"] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Frederick the Great]] was initially buried.

==Post-WWII views==

Since the defeat in World War II and the [[denazification]] campaign, historical German militarism has become anathema in German culture, focused on [[collective responsibility]] and [[Vergangenheitsbewältigung|atonement]]. At the same time, the related non-military, bourgeois virtues of efficiency, discipline and work ethics remain in high standing. This has led to the concept of "Prussian virtues" being regarded with mixed feelings in modern-day Germany. 
Amongst the [[German student movement|German student protests of 1968]], militarist virtues were 
rejected as prerequisite for the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime.
The term ''[[:wikt:Kadavergehorsam|Kadavergehorsam]]'' for "blind obedience", originally a slur directed against [[Jesuits]] during the 1870s ''[[Kulturkampf]]'', came to be used as a derogatory staple of "Prussian" military ethos. Similarly, the term ''[[Nibelungentreue]]'' ("Nibelung loyalty"), which in the German Empire had been used in a positive sense for the military virtue of absolute loyalty, came to be used derogatorily in reference to fanatical loyalty characteristic of [[fascism]].
In 1982, amid the controversy surrounding the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]], in response to [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] [[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Helmut Schmidt]]'s call for a return to such virtues, [[Saarbrücken]]'s SPD mayor [[Oskar Lafontaine]] commented that these were "perfectly suited to run a concentration camp". 
In 2006, the Prime Minister of Brandenburg [[Matthias Platzeck]] called for a return to Prussian virtues, citing "good basic virtues, such as honesty, reliability, and diligence".&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, R. (2004.) ''Die deutschen Mörder''. Translate from English by Jürgen Peter Krause. Bastei-Lübbe, Bergisch Gladbach, {{ISBN|340464218X}} pp. 151ff. quoted from: ''Himmler, Geheimreden 1933–1945'', ed.

'''Public hypersphere''' is a new kind of public sphere that has come into existence globally through the use of modern information technology, digital media, and computer networks.

Swedish writer [[Karl-Erik Tallmo]] used the corresponding Swedish term ''hyperoffentlighet'' in an article in the daily ''Sydsvenska Dagbladet'' in 1999&lt;ref&gt;Tallmo, K-E, "Konsten att låsa köksdörren på nätet", ''Sydsvenska Dagbladet'' November 25, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and the same year also the English expression ''public hypersphere'' in an article in the journal ''Human IT''.&lt;ref&gt;Tallmo, K-E, "Self-publishing: publicera själv eller publicera sig själv?", ''Human IT'' nr 3/1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is derived from [[Jürgen Habermas]] and his thoughts concerning a ''bourgeois public sphere''. The public hypersphere, however, is not limited to publishing or the European café culture, not even to the Internet but includes the larger part of human relations, mediated or not. It encompasses both voluntary participation as well as involuntary, through mass surveillance: "The electronic traces we leave constantly write our autobiographies ... [The public hypersphere is] a gas that fills the entire available space, it is 'the place that doesn't exist'." The public hypersphere is "not just public or transparent to a higher degree than the regular public sphere; it has a whole new structure. Mathematicians talk about ''hyperspheres'' when they want to describe a sphere of higher dimensionality, where normal geometric rules don't apply – here, the shortest path between two points is not necessarily a straight line."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://slowfox.wordpress.com/2005/04/04/our-new-public-hypersphere/
| first=Karl-Erik | last=Tallmo | title=Our new public hypersphere | work=Slowfox (blog) | date=2005-04-04 | accessdate=2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French philosopher and media scholar [[Pierre Lévy]] used the expression  ''l'hypersphère publique'' in an article in 2011 in the journal ''Medium''. He describes the combined effect of social media, real time functions, and wireless technology. He mentions API programming as important when it comes to connecting various databases with different interfaces. He writes that traditional information monopolies are dissolved and a kind of ''[[digital ecosystem]]'' has evolved, where old and new media interact. Citizens gain new liberties in expressing and retrieving information but also new ways to establish personal contacts. All these new phenomena "contribute in building a ubiquitous medium, hypercomplex and fractal, that everyone, ''nolens volens'', partake in designing, directing and using ..."&lt;ref&gt;Lévy Pierre, "L'hypersphère publique", ''Médium'' nr 4/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lévy has also written about the transformation of the public sphere in his book ''Cyberdémocratie'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Lévy Pierre, ''Cyberdémocratie'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In German, the word ''Hyperöffentlichkeit'' has been used by sociologist [[Udo Thiedeke]] in his characterization of [[Howard Rheingold | Howard Rheingold's]] ideas concerning the virtual community,&lt;ref&gt;Rheingold, H.S., ''The Virtual Community: Homestanding on the Electronic Frontier'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; that is a high degree of participation and interactivity.&lt;ref&gt;Thiedeke, Udo, "Virtuelle Gruppen. Begriff und Charakteristik", i ''Virtuelle Gruppen. Charakteristika und Problemdimensionen'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4992">In mathematics, a '''rational monoid''' is a [[monoid]], an algebraic structure, for which each element can be represented in a "normal form" which can be computed by a [[finite state transducer|finite transducer]]: multiplication in such a monoid is "easy", in the sense that it can be described by a [[rational function (monoid)|rational function]].

==Definition==
Consider a monoid ''M''.  Consider a pair (''A'',''L'') where ''A'' is a finite subset of ''M'' that generates ''M'' as a monoid, and ''L'' is a language on ''A'' (that is, a subset of the set of all strings ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;).  Let φ be the map from the [[free monoid]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; to ''M'' given by evaluating a string as a product in ''M''.  We say that ''L'' is a ''rational cross-section'' if φ induces a bijection between ''L'' and ''M''.  We say that (''A'',''L'') is a ''rational structure'' for ''M'' if in addition the [[Kernel (algebra)#Monoid homomorphisms|kernel]] of φ, viewed as a subset of the product monoid ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;×''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[rational set]].

A '''quasi-rational monoid''' is one for which ''L'' is a [[rational relation]]: a '''rational monoid''' is one for which there is also a [[rational function (monoid)|rational function]] cross-section of ''L''.  Since ''L'' is a subset of a free monoid, [[Kleene's theorem]] holds and a rational function is just one that can be instantiated by a finite state transducer.

==Examples==
* A finite monoid is rational.
* A group is a rational monoid if and only if it is finite.
* A finitely generated free monoid is rational.
* The monoid M4 generated by the set {0,''e'', ''a'',''b'', ''x'',''y''} subject to relations in which ''e'' is the identity, 0 is an [[absorbing element]], each of ''a'' and ''b'' commutes with each of ''x'' and ''y'' and ''ax'' = ''bx'', ''ay'' = ''by'' = ''bby'', ''xx'' = ''xy'' = ''yx'' = ''yy'' = 0 is rational but not automatic.
* The '''Fibonacci monoid''', the quotient of the free monoid on two generators {''a'',''b''}&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; by the congruence ''aab'' = ''bba''.

==Green's relations==
The [[Green's relations]] for a rational monoid satisfy ''D'' = ''J''.&lt;ref name=Sak87&gt;Sakarovitch (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Kleene's theorem holds for rational monoids: that is, a subset is a recognisable set if and only if it is a rational set.

A rational monoid is not necessarily [[Automatic semigroup|automatic]], and vice versa.  However, a rational monoid is asynchronously automatic and [[Hyperbolic monoid|hyperbolic]].

A rational monoid is a [[regulator monoid]] and a [[quasi-rational monoid]]: each of these implies that it is a [[Kleene monoid]], that is, a monoid in which Kleene's theorem holds.

[[File:Cold meat salad.jpg|thumb|Various distinct components can combine to make a salad.]]

The '''salad bowl''' concept suggests that the integration of the many different cultures of [[United States]] residents combine like a [[salad]], as opposed to the more traditional notion of a cultural [[melting pot]]. New York City can be considered as being a "salad bowl". In [[Canada]] this concept is more commonly known as the [[cultural mosaic]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalman, Bobbie (2010). Canada: The Culture. Crabtree Pub. p. 4. {{ISBN|978-0-7787-9284-0}}. Retrieved 2012-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; In the salad bowl model, different American cultures are brought together &amp;mdash; like salad ingredients &amp;mdash; but do not form together into a single [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] culture. Each culture keeps its own distinct qualities. This idea proposes a society of many individual, "pure" cultures in addition to the mixed culture that is modern American culture, and the term has become more [[political correctness|politically correct]] than ''melting pot'' {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}, since the latter suggests that ethnic groups may be unable to preserve their cultures due to [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]...

Some {{Who|date=August 2013}} have compared the European concept of [[multiculturalism]] ([[multikulti]]) to a salad bowl approach, which prevents the full integration of immigrant groups into host societies, whereas the traditional American approach of the [[melting pot]] results in successful integration of successive immigrant waves into the larger American society.

The story of [[Pocahontas]] and [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] or the peaceful co-existence of Native Americans and new immigrants from England has been counted as a prototype of American multiculturalism.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, some scholars{{Who|date=August 2013}} blamed it as a [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] concept of [[melting pot]] and suggested a new concept of salad bowl.

An example of the European version of a salad bowl can be seen in its policy regarding the EU programme ‘integration of non-European nationals’ which finances and promotes integration initiatives targeting those who are not members of the EU25. This project aims to encourage dialogue in civil society, develop integration models, and spread and highlight the best initiatives regarding integration.

The salad bowl idea in practice has its supporters and detractors. Supporters argue that being American does not inherently tie a person to a single culture, though rather to citizenship and loyalty to the United States. Thus, one does not need to abandon their cultural heritage in order to be considered "American". Critics tend to oppose the idea in tandem with other critiques on multiculturalism, saying that America needs to have a common culture in order to preserve a common national identity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

'''SaltMod''' is [[computer program]] for the prediction of the [[salinity]] of [[soil moisture]], [[groundwater]] and [[drainage]] water, the depth of the [[watertable]], and the drain [[discharge (hydrology)]] in [[irrigation|irrigated]] [[agriculture|agricultural]] lands, using different [[geohydrology|(geo)hydrologic]] conditions, varying [[water management]] options, including the use of ground water for irrigation, and several [[crop rotation|cropping rotation]] schedules.
The water management options include irrigation, drainage, and the use of subsurface drainage water from pipe drains, ditches or [[Water well|wells]] for irrigation.

==Soil salinity models==
The majority of the computer models available for water and solute transport in the soil (e.g. Swatre,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.alterra.wur.nl/Internet/webdocs/ilri-publicaties/publicaties/Pub55/pub55-h4.pdf Swatre]&lt;/ref&gt; DrainMod &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/wetdrain/wetdrain-tools.html Drainmod] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623100817/http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/wetdrain/wetdrain-tools.html |date=2007-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ) are based on Richard's [[differential equation]] for the movement of water in [[Vadose zone|unsaturated]] soil in combination with a differential salinity [[dispersion equation]]. The models require input of soil characteristics like the relation between unsaturated soil moisture content, water tension, [[hydraulic conductivity]] and dispersivity.

These relations vary to a great extent from place to place and are not easy to measure. The models use short time steps and need at least a daily data base of hydrological phenomena. Altogether this makes model application to a fairly large project the job of a team of specialists with ample facilities.

==Rationale==
There is a need for a computer program that is easier to operate and that requires a simpler [[data structure]] than most currently available models. Therefore, the SaltModod program was designed keeping in mind a relative simplicity of operation to facilitate the use by field technicians, engineers and project planners instead of specialized [[geohydrology|geo-hydrologists]].

It aims at using input data that are generally available, or that can be estimated with reasonable accuracy, or that can be measured with relative ease. Although the calculations are done numerically and have to be repeated many times, the final results can be ''checked by hand'' using the formulas in the manual.

SaltMod's objective is to predict the long-term hydro-salinity in terms of general [[wikt:trend|trend]]s, not to arrive at exact predictions of how, for example, the situation would be on the first of April in ten years from now.

Further, SaltMod gives the option of the re-use of drainage and well water (e.g. for irrigation) and it can account for farmers' response to [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]], [[soil salinity]], water scarcity and over-pumping from the [[aquifer]]. Also it offers the possibility to introduce [[Drainage system (agriculture)|subsurface drainage systems]] at varying depths and with varying capacity so that they can be [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimized]].
Other features of Saltmod are found in the next section.

==Principles==
===Seasonal approach===
The computation method Saltmod is based on seasonal [[water balance]]s of agricultural lands. Four seasons in one year can be distinguished, e.g. dry, wet, cold, hot, irrigation or [[fallow]] seasons. The number of seasons (Ns) can be chosen between a minimum of one and a maximum of four. The larger the number of seasons becomes, the larger is the number of input data required. The duration of each season (Ts) is given in number of months (0 &lt; Ts &lt; 12). Day to day water balances are not considered for several reasons:
#daily inputs would require much information, which may not be readily available;
#the method is especially developed to predict long term, not day-to-day, trends and predictions for the future are more reliably made on a seasonal (long term) than on a daily (short term) basis, due to the high variability of short-term data;
#even though the precision of the predictions for the future may still not be very high, a lot is gained when the trend is sufficiently clear; for example, it need not be a major constraint to design appropriate [[soil salinity control]] measures when a certain salinity level, predicted by Saltmod to occur after 20 years, will in reality occur after 15 or 25 years.

===Hydrological data===
The method uses seasonal water balance components as input data. These are related to the surface [[hydrology]] (like [[rainfall]], [[evaporation]], irrigation, use of drain and well water for irrigation, [[Surface runoff|runoff]]), and the [[aquifer]] [[hydrology]] (like upward seepage, natural drainage, pumping from wells). The other water balance components (like downward [[percolation]], upward [[capillary rise]], [[Drainage system (agriculture)|subsurface drainage]]) are given as output.&lt;br&gt;
The quantity of drainage water, as an output, is determined by two drainage intensity factors for drainage above and below drain level respectively (to be given with the input data), a drainage reduction factor (to simulate a limited operation of the drainage system), and the height of the water table, resulting from the computed water balance. Variation of the drainage intensity factors and the drainage reduction factor gives the opportunity to simulate the effect of different drainage options.

===Agricultural data===
[[File:Riego por surcos.JPG|thumb|250px|Irrigated land]]
The input data on [[irrigation]], [[evaporation]], and surface [[Surface runoff|runoff]] are to be specified per [[season]] for three kinds of agricultural practices, which can be chosen at the discretion of the user: 
#A:	irrigated land with crops of group A
#B:	irrigated land with crops of group B
#U:	non-irrigated land with rainfed crops or fallow land
The groups, expressed in fractions of the total area, may consist of combinations of [[crop]]s or just of a single kind of crop. For example, as the A type crops one may specify the lightly irrigated cultures, and as the B type the more heavily irrigated ones, such as [[sugarcane]] and [[rice]]. But one can also take A as rice and B as sugarcane, or perhaps [[tree]]s and [[orchard]]s. The A, B and/or U crops can be taken differently in different [[season]]s, e.g. A=[[wheat]]+[[barley]] in winter and A=[[maize]] in summer while B=[[vegetable]]s in winter and B=[[cotton]] in summer.&lt;br&gt; 
	Un-irrigated land can be specified in two ways: (1) as U=1&amp;minus;A&amp;minus;B and (2) as A and/or B with zero irrigation. A combination can also be made.&lt;br&gt;
	Further, a specification must be given of the seasonal [[crop rotation|rotation]] of the different [[land use]]s over the total area, e.g. full rotation, no rotation at all, or incomplete rotation.  This occurs with a rotation index. The rotations are taken over the seasons within the year. To obtain rotations over the years it is advisable to introduce annual input changes.&lt;br&gt;
	When a fraction A1, B1 and/or U1 in the first season differs from fractions are A2, B2 and/or U2 in the second season, because the irrigation regimes in the seasons differ, the program will detect that a certain rotation occurs. If one wishes to avoid this, one may specify the same fractions in all seasons (A2=A1, B2=B1, U2=U1), but the crops and irrigation quantities may have to be adjusted in proportion.&lt;br&gt;
	Cropping rotation schedules vary widely in different parts of the world. Creative combinations of area fractions, rotation indexes, irrigation quantities and annual input changes can accommodate many types of agricultural practices.
	Variation of the area fractions and/or the rotational schedule gives the opportunity to simulate the effect of different agricultural practices on the water and salt balance.

===Soil strata===
[[File:Aquifer en.svg|thumb|250px|The aquifer can play an important role in soil salinity]]
Saltmod accepts four different reservoirs, three of which are in the soil profile:
#	a surface reservoir
#	an upper (shallow) soil reservoir or root zone
#	an intermediate soil reservoir or transition zone
#	a deep reservoir or [[aquifer]].
The upper soil reservoir is defined by the soil depth from which water can evaporate or be taken up by plant roots. It can be equal to the rootzone.&lt;br&gt;
The root zone can be saturated, [[Vadose zone|unsaturated]], or partly saturated, depending on the [[water balance]]. All water movements in this zone are vertical, either upward or downward, depending on the water balance. (In a future version of Saltmod, the upper soil reservoir may be divided into two equal parts to detect the trend in the vertical salinity distribution.)&lt;br&gt;
The transition zone can also be saturated, unsaturated or partly saturated. All flows in this zone are vertical, except the flow to subsurface drains.&lt;br&gt;
If a horizontal subsurface [[Drainage system (agriculture)|drainage system]] is present, this must be placed in the transition zone, which is then divided into two parts: an upper transition zone (above drain level) and a lower transition zone (below drain level).&lt;br&gt;
If one wishes to distinguish an upper and lower part of the transition zone in the absence of a subsurface drainage system, one may specify in the input data a drainage system with zero intensity.&lt;br&gt;
The aquifer has mainly horizontal flow. Pumped wells, if present, receive their water from the aquifer only.

===Water balances===
[[Image:SoilLeaching2.jpg|thumb|250px|Water balance factors in the top soil]]
The [[water balance]]s are calculated for each reservoir separately as shown in the article [[Hydrology (agriculture)]]. The excess water leaving one reservoir is converted into incoming water for the next reservoir.&lt;br&gt;
The three soil reservoirs can be assigned a different thickness and storage coefficients, to be given as input data.&lt;br&gt;
In a particular situation, the transition zone or the aquifer need not be present. Then, it must be given a minimum thickness of 0.1 m.&lt;br&gt;
The depth of the [[water table]], calculated from the water balances, is assumed to be the same for the whole area. If this assumption is not acceptable, the area must be divided into separate units.&lt;br&gt;
Under certain conditions, the height of the water table influences the water balance components. For example a rise of the water table towards the soil surface may lead to an increase of [[evaporation]], surface [[Surface runoff|runoff]], and subsurface drainage, or a decrease of [[percolation]] losses from canals. This, in turn, leads to a change of the water balance, which again influences the height of the water table, etc.&lt;br&gt;
This chain of reactions is one of the reasons why Saltmod has been developed into a computer program. It takes a number of repeated calculations ([[iterations]]) to find the correct equilibrium of the water balance, which would be a tedious job if done by hand. Other reasons are that a computer program facilitates the computations for different water management options over long periods of time (with the aim to simulate their long-term effects) and for trial runs with varying parameters.

===Drains, wells, and re-use===
The [[Drainage system (agriculture)|sub-surface drainage]] can be accomplished through [[Tile drainage|drains]] or pumped [[Water well|wells]].&lt;br&gt;
The subsurface drains are characterized by drain depth and ''drainage capacity factor ''. The drains are located in the transition zone. The subsurface drainage facility can be applied to natural or artificial drainage systems. The functioning of an artificial drainage system can be regulated through a ''drainage control factor''.&lt;br&gt;
When no drainage system is present, installing drains with zero capacity offers the opportunity to obtain separate water and salt balances for an upper and lower part of the transition zone.&lt;br&gt;
The pumped wells are located in the aquifer. Their functioning is characterized by the well discharge.&lt;br&gt;
The drain and well water can be used for irrigation through a ''re-use factor''. This may affect the salt balance and the irrigation efficiency or sufficiency.
[[Image:SALTMOD4.JPG|thumb|200px|Leaching curves, calibrating leaching efficiency]]

===Salt balances===
The [[Soil salinity control|salt balances]] are calculated for each reservoir separately. They are based on their [[water balance]]s, using the ''salt concentrations'' of the incoming and outgoing water. Some concentrations must be given as input data, like the initial salt concentrations of the water in the different soil reservoirs, of the irrigation water and of the incoming ground water in the aquifer.


[[File:Saltleaching.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Graphic presentation of soil salinity trends]]
The concentrations are expressed in terms of [[electric conductivity]] (EC in dS/m). When the concentrations are known in terms of g salt/l water, the rule of thumb: 1 g/l -&gt; 1.7 dS/m can be used. Usually, salt concentrations of the soil are expressed in ECe, the electric conductivity of an extract of a saturated soil paste (saturation extract). In Saltmod, the salt concentration is expressed as the EC of the soil moisture when saturated under field conditions. As a rule, one can use the conversion rate EC : ECe = 2 : 1.&lt;br&gt;
Salt concentrations of outgoing water (either from one reservoir into the other or by subsurface drainage) are computed on the basis of salt balances, using different ''leaching or salt mixing efficiencies'' to be given with the input data. The effects of different [[Leaching model#Leaching efficiency|leaching efficiencies]] can be simulated by varying their input value.


If drain or well water is used for irrigation, the method computes the salt concentration of the mixed irrigation water in the course of the time and the subsequent effect on the soil and ground water salinities, which again influences the salt concentration of the drain and well water. By varying the fraction of used drain or well water (to be given in the input data), the long-term effect of different fractions can be simulated.


The [[solvation|dissolution]] of solid soil minerals or the chemical [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of poorly soluble salts is not included in the computation method, but to some extent it can be accounted for through the input data, e.g. by increasing or decreasing the salt concentration of the irrigation water or of the incoming water in the aquifer.

===Farmers' responses===
If required, farmers' responses to [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|water logging]] and [[soil salinity]] can be automatically accounted for. The method can gradually decrease:
#	the amount of irrigation water applied when the [[water table]] becomes shallower;
#	the fraction of irrigated land when the available irrigation water is scarce;
#	the fraction of irrigated land when the soil salinity increases; for this purpose, the salinity is given a [[stochastic]] interpretation.
Response (1) is different for ponded (submerged) [[rice]] (paddy) and "dry foot" crops.


The responses influence the water and salt balances, which, in their turn, slow down the process of water logging and salinization. Ultimately an equilibrium situation will be brought about.


The user can also introduce farmers' responses by manually changing the relevant input data. Perhaps it will be useful first to study the automatic farmers' responses and their effect and thereafter decide what the farmers' responses will be in the view of the user.

The user can also introduce farmers' responses by manually changing the relevant input data. Perhaps it will be useful first to study the automatic farmers' responses and their effect and thereafter decide what the farmers' responses will be in the view of the user.

===Annual input changes===
The program may run with fixed input data for the number of years determined by the user. This option can be used to predict future developments based on long-term average input values, e.g. rainfall, as it will be difficult to assess the future values of the input data year by year.
The program also offers the possibility to follow historic records with annually changing input values (e.g. rainfall, irrigation, agricultural practices), the calculations must be made year by year. If this possibility is chosen, the program creates transfer files by which the final conditions of the previous year (e.g. water table and salinity) are automatically used as the initial conditions for the subsequent period. This facility makes it possible to use various generated rainfall sequences drawn [[random]]ly from a known rainfall [[probability distribution]] and obtain a [[stochastic]] prediction of the resulting output parameters.


If the computations are made with annual changes, not all input parameters can be changed, notably the thickness of the soil reservoirs and their total porosities as these would cause illogical shifts in the water and salt balances.

[[Image:GOHANAFREQ.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cumulative frequency distribution of soil salinity]]
[[Image:Interacstudy.gif|thumb|200px|Capillary rise, output]]

===Output data===
The output of Saltmod is given for each season of any year during any number of years, as specified with the input data. The output data comprise hydrological and salinity aspects.

The data are filed in the form of tables that can be inspected directly or further analyzed with [[spreadsheet]] programs.

As the soil salinity is very variable from place to place (figure left) SaltMod includes frequency distributions in the output. The figure was made with the CumFreq program [http://www.waterlog.info/cumfreq.htm] .
 
The program offers the possibility to develop a multitude of relations between varied input data, resulting outputs and time.&lt;br&gt; 
However, as it is not possible to foresee all different uses that may be made, the program offers only a limited number of standard [[graphics]].
 
The program is designed to make use of spreadsheet programs for the detailed output analysis, in which the relations between various input and output variables can be established according to the scenario developed by the user.

Although the [[computations]] need many [[iterations]], all the end results can be ''checked by hand'' using the equations presented in the manual.

Part of the [[Simulacra and Simulation|three order simulacra]], the '''second-order simulacra''', a term coined by [[Jean Baudrillard]], are [[symbol]]s of a non faithful representation to the original. Here, signs and images do not faithfully show us reality, but might hint at the existence of something real which the sign itself is incapable of encapsulating.&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard 1994 [1981], Simulacra and Simulation, University of Michigan Press, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

While the first-order simulacra is a faithful copy to the original and the third order are symbols that have become without referents, that is, symbols with no real object to represent but pretends to be a faithful copy of an original. Simply put, a third-order simulacra are symbols in themselves taken for reality and further layer of [[symbol]]ism is added. This occurs when the symbol is taken to be more important or authoritative of the original entity, authenticity has been replaced by copy (thus reality is replaced by a substitute).

The consequence of the propagation of second-order [[simulacra]] is that, within the affected context, nothing is "real," though those engaged in the illusion are incapable of seeing it. Instead of having experiences, people observe spectacles, via real or [[metaphor]]ical control screens. Instead of the real, we have simulation and simulacra, the [[Hyperreality|hyperreal]].

In his essay "The Precession of the Simulacra," Baudrillard recalls a tale from a short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]] in which a king requests a map (i.e. a symbol) to be produced so detailed that it ends up coming into one-to-one correspondence with the territory (i.e. the real area the map is to represent); this references the philosophical concept of [[map–territory relation]]. Baudrillard argues that in the [[postmodern]] epoch, the territory ceases to exist, and there is nothing left but the map; or indeed, the very concepts of the map and the territory have become indistinguishable, the distinction which once existed between them having been erased.

Among the many issues associated with the propagation of second-order simulacra to the third-order is what Baudrillard considers the termination of history. The method of this termination comes through the lack of oppositional elements in society, with the mass having become "the [[silent majority]]," an imploded concept which absorbs images passively, becoming itself a media overwritten by those who speak for it (i.e. the people are symbolically represented by governing agents and market statistic, marginalizing the people themselves). For Baudrillard this is the natural result of an ethic of unity in which actually agonistic opposites are taken to be essentially the same. For example, Baudrillard contends that [[moral universalism]] (human rights, equality) is equated with [[globalization]], which is not concerned with immutable values but with mediums of exchange and equalisation such as the global market and [[mass media]].

[[File:Range finding from shuttle to ISS.jpg|thumb|[[Astronaut]] [[Christopher Cassidy]] uses a [[rangefinder]] to determine distance between the [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']] and the [[International Space Station]]]]
[[File:Apollo 11 lunar module.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo Lunar Module]] ascent stage rendezvous with the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] in lunar orbit after returning from a landing]]
A '''space rendezvous''' is an [[orbital maneuver]] during which two [[spacecraft]], one of which is often a [[space station]], arrive at the same [[orbit]] and approach to a very close distance (e.g. within visual contact). Rendezvous requires a precise match of the [[Orbital elements|orbital velocities and position vectors]] of the two spacecraft, allowing them to remain at a constant distance through [[orbital station-keeping]]. Rendezvous may or may not be followed by [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|docking or berthing]], procedures which bring the spacecraft into physical contact and create a link between them.

The same rendezvous technique can be used for spacecraft "landing" on natural objects with a weak gravitational field, e.g. landing on one of the [[Moons of Mars|Martian moons]] would require the same matching of orbital velocities, followed by a "descent" that shares some similarities with docking.

== History ==
In its first human spaceflight program [[Vostok programme|Vostok]], the [[Soviet Union]] launched pairs of spacecraft from the same launch pad, one or two days apart ([[Vostok 3|Vostok 3 and 4]] in 1962, and [[Vostok 5|Vostok 5 and 6]] in 1963). In each case, the [[launch vehicle]]s' guidance systems inserted the two craft into nearly identical orbits; however, this was not nearly precise enough to achieve rendezvous, as the Vostok lacked maneuvering thrusters to adjust its orbit to match that of its twin. The initial separation distances were in the range of {{convert|5|to|6.5|km|mi|sp=us}}, and slowly diverged to thousands of kilometers (over a thousand miles) over the course of the missions.&lt;ref name=Gatland&gt;{{Cite book

In 1963 [[Buzz Aldrin]] submitted his doctoral thesis titled, '' Line-Of-Sight Guidance Techniques For Manned Orbital Rendezvous.''&lt;ref name=buzz&gt;{{cite web |title=Orbital Rendezvous |author=Buzz Aldrin |url=http://buzzaldrin.com/space-vision/rocket_science/orbital-rendezvous/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a NASA astronaut, Aldrin worked to "translate complex [[orbital mechanics]] into relatively simple flight plans for my colleagues." &lt;ref name=waterkeeper&gt;{{cite web |title=From Earth to Moon to Earth |author=Buzz Aldrin |url=http://www.waterkeeper.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fall-2005-Hawks-Doves.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527224845/http://www.waterkeeper.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fall-2005-Hawks-Doves.pdf |archivedate=May 27, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First attempt failed===

The first attempt at rendezvous was made on June 3, 1965, when US astronaut [[Jim McDivitt]] tried to maneuver his [[Gemini 4]] craft to meet its spent [[Titan II GLV|Titan II launch vehicle]]'s upper stage. McDivitt was unable to get close enough to achieve station-keeping, due to depth-perception problems, and stage propellant venting which kept moving it around.&lt;ref name="mcdivittoh"&gt;Oral History Transcript / [http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/McDivittJA/mcdivittja.pdf James A. McDivitt] / Interviewed by Doug Ward / Elk Lake, Michigan – June 29, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the Gemini 4 attempts at rendezvous were unsuccessful largely because [[NASA]] engineers had yet to learn the [[orbital mechanics]] involved in the process. Simply pointing the active vehicle's nose at the target and thrusting was unsuccessful. If the target is ahead in the orbit and the tracking vehicle increases speed, its altitude also increases, actually moving it away from the target. The higher altitude then increases orbital period due to [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Third law|Kepler's third law]], putting the tracker not only above, but also behind the target. The proper technique requires changing the tracking vehicle's orbit to allow the rendezvous target to either catch up or be caught up with, and then at the correct moment changing to the same orbit as the target with no relative motion between the vehicles (for example, putting the tracker into a lower orbit, which has a shorter orbital period allowing it to catch up, then executing a [[Hohmann transfer orbit|Hohmann transfer]] back to the original orbital height).&lt;ref name="gemini-4-ea"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/gemini4.htm |title=Gemini 4 |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129073633/http://astronautix.com/flights/gemini4.htm |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As [[Project Gemini|GPO]] engineer André Meyer later remarked, "There is a good explanation for what went wrong with rendezvous." The crew, like everyone else at [[Manned Spacecraft Center|MSC]], "just didn't understand or reason out the [[orbital mechanics]] involved. As a result, we all got a whole lot smarter and really perfected rendezvous maneuvers, which [[Apollo program|Apollo]] now uses."|&lt;ref name="gemini-4-ea" /&gt;}}

===First successful rendezvous===
[[File:Gemini 7 in orbit - GPN-2006-000035.jpg|right|thumb|Gemini 7 photographed from Gemini 6 in 1965]]
Rendezvous was first successfully accomplished by US astronaut [[Wally Schirra]] on December 15, 1965. Schirra maneuvered the [[Gemini 6A|Gemini 6]] spacecraft within {{convert|1|ft|cm}} of its sister craft [[Gemini 7]]. The spacecraft were not equipped to dock with each other, but maintained station-keeping for more than 20 minutes. Schirra later commented:

{{quote|Somebody said ... when you come to within three miles (5 km), you've rendezvoused. If anybody thinks they've pulled a rendezvous off at three miles (5 km), have fun! This is when we started doing our work. I don't think rendezvous is over until you are stopped – completely stopped – with no relative motion between the two vehicles, at a range of approximately {{convert|120|ft|m}}. That's rendezvous! From there on, it's stationkeeping. That's when you can go back and play the game of driving a car or driving an airplane or pushing a skateboard – it's about that simple.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4203/ch12-7.htm|title=On The Shoulders of Titans - Ch12-7|author=|date=|website=www.hq.nasa.gov|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===First docking===
[[File:S66-25781 PR.jpg|thumb| Gemini 8 Agena target vehicle]]
[[File:Gemini 8 docking.jpg|thumb|Gemini 8 docking with the Agena in March 1966]]

The first docking of two spacecraft was achieved on March 16, 1966 when [[Gemini 8]], under the command of [[Neil Armstrong]], rendezvoused and docked with an unmanned [[Agena Target Vehicle]]. Gemini 6 was to have been the first docking mission, but had to be cancelled when that mission's Agena vehicle was destroyed during launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=GEM|title=NASA - NSSDCA - Spacecraft - Details|author=|date=|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets carried out the first automated, unmanned docking between [[Cosmos 186]] and [[Cosmos 188]] on October 30, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1967-105A NSSDC ID: 1967-105A] NASA, NSSDC Master Catalog&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Soviet cosmonaut to attempt a manual docking was [[Georgy Beregovoy]] who unsuccessfully tried to dock his [[Soyuz 3]] craft with the unmanned [[Soyuz 2]] in October 1968. He was able to bring his craft from {{convert|200|m|ft|sp=us}} to as close as {{convert|1|ft|cm|order=flip}}, but was unable to dock before exhausting his maneuvering fuel.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The Soviet's first successful manned docking occurred on January 16, 1969 when [[Soyuz 4]] and [[Soyuz 5]] docked and exchanged two crew members.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The first rendezvous of two spacecraft from different countries took place on July 17, 1975, when an Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soyuz spacecraft as part of the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The first multiple space docking took place when both [[Soyuz 26]] and [[Soyuz 27]] were docked to the [[Salyut 6]] space station during January 1978.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

A rendezvous takes place each time a spacecraft brings crew members or supplies to an orbiting space station. The first spacecraft to do this was [[Soyuz 11]], which successfully docked with the [[Salyut 1]] station on June 7, 1971.&lt;ref name="soyuz-11-ea"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/soyuz11.htm |title=Soyuz 11 |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica |author=Mark Wade |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030215242/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/soyuz11.htm |archivedate=October 30, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human spaceflight]] missions have successfully made rendezvous with six [[Salyut]] stations, with [[Skylab]], with ''[[Mir]]'' and with the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).

&lt;!-- Need paragraph here discussing rendezvous as part of on-orbit assembly of modular stations. --&gt;
[[Robotic spacecraft]] are also used to rendezvous with and resupply space stations.

"All the Russian commanders had to do was sit by and watch."&lt;/ref&gt; and the ISS using the [[Kurs (docking system)|Kurs docking system]], Europe's [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] also uses this system to dock with the Russian segment of the ISS. Several unmanned spacecraft use NASA's [[common berthing mechanism|berthing mechanism]] rather than a [[Androgynous Peripheral Attach System#APAS-95|docking port]]. The Japanese [[H-II Transfer Vehicle]] (HTV), [[SpaceX Dragon]], and [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Orbital Sciences' Cygnus]] spacecraft all maneuver to a close rendezvous and maintain station-keeping, allowing the ISS [[Canadarm2]] to grapple and move the spacecraft to a berthing port on the US segment. The Russian segment only uses docking ports so it is not possible for HTV, Dragon and Cygnus to find a berth there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Japanese Cargo Craft Captured, Berthed to Station |author=Jerry Wright |date=30 July 2015 |publisher=nasa.gov}}https://www.nasa.gov/content/station-crew-captures-japanese-cargo-craft&lt;/ref&gt;

Space rendezvous has been used for a variety of other purposes, including recent service missions to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. Historically, for the missions of [[Project Apollo]] that landed astronauts on the [[Moon]], the ascent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] would rendezvous and dock with the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] in [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] maneuvers. Also, the [[STS-49]] crew rendezvoused with and attached a rocket motor to the [[Intelsat]] [[Intelsat VI|VI]] F-3 [[communications satellite]] to allow it to make an [[orbital maneuver]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Possible future rendezvous may be made by a yet to be developed automated Hubble Robotic Vehicle (HRV), and by the [[CX-OLEV]], which is being developed for rendezvous with a [[geosynchronous satellite]] that has run out of fuel. The CX-OLEV would take over [[orbital stationkeeping]] and/or finally bring the satellite to a graveyard orbit, after which the CX-OLEV can possibly be reused for another satellite. Gradual transfer from the [[geostationary transfer orbit]] to the [[geosynchronous orbit]] will take a number of months, using [[Hall effect thruster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orbitalrecovery.com/news15.html|title=orbitalrecovery.com|author=|date=|website=www.orbitalrecovery.com|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively the two spacecraft are already together, and just undock and dock in a different way:
*Soyuz spacecraft from one docking point to another on the ISS or Salyut{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
*In the [[Apollo spacecraft]], a maneuver known as [[transposition, docking, and extraction]]  was performed an hour or so after [[Trans Lunar Injection]] of the sequence third stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket / LM inside LM adapter / CSM (in order from bottom to top at launch, also the order from back to front with respect to the current motion), with CSM manned, LM at this stage unmanned:{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
**the CSM separated, while the four upper panels of the LM adapter were disposed of
**the CSM turned 180 degrees (from engine backward, toward LM, to forward)
**the CSM connected to the LM while that was still connected to the third stage
**the CSM/LM combination then separated from the third stage

The standard technique for rendezvous and docking is to dock an active vehicle, the "chaser", with a passive "target". This technique has been used successfully for the Gemini, Apollo, Apollo/Soyuz, Salyut, Skylab, Mir, ISS, and Tiāngōng programs.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

To properly understand spacecraft rendezvous it is essential to understand the relation between spacecraft velocity and orbit. A spacecraft in a certain orbit cannot arbitrarily alter its velocity. Each orbit correlates to a certain orbital velocity. If the spacecraft fires thrusters and increases (or decreases) its velocity it will obtain a different orbit, one that correlates to the higher (or lower) velocity. For circular orbits, higher orbits have a lower orbital velocity. Lower orbits have a higher orbital velocity.

For orbital rendezvous to occur, both spacecraft must be in the same [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]], and the [[Orbit phasing|phase of the orbit]] (the position of the spacecraft in the orbit) must be matched. The "chaser" is placed in a slightly lower orbit than the target. The lower the orbit, the higher the orbital velocity. The difference in orbital velocities of chaser and target is therefore such that the chaser is faster than the target, and catches up with it.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Once the two spacecraft are sufficiently close, the chaser's orbit is synchronized with the target's orbit. That is, the chaser will be accelerated. This increase in velocity carries the chaser to a higher orbit. The increase in velocity is chosen such that the chaser approximately assumes the orbit of the target. Stepwise, the chaser closes in on the target, until proximity operations (see below) can be started.
In the very final phase, the closure rate is reduced by use of the active vehicle's [[reaction control system]].
Docking typically occurs at a rate of {{convert|0.1|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to {{convert|0.2|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;

===Rendezvous phases===
Space rendezvous of an active, or "chaser," spacecraft with an (assumed) passive spacecraft may be divided into several phases, and typically starts with the two spacecraft in separate orbits, typically separated by more than {{convert|10000|km|sp=us}}:&lt;ref name=wertz2003/&gt;

A variety of [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)|spacecraft control techniques]] may be used to effect the [[Translation (physics)|translational]] and [[rotation]]al [[Orbital maneuver|maneuvers]] necessary for proximity operations and docking.&lt;ref name=lee2010&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Daero |author2=Pernicka, Henry |title=Optimal Control for Proximity Operations and Docking |journal=International Journal of Aeronautical &amp; Space Science |date=2010 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=206–220 |doi=10.5139/IJASS.2010.11.3.206 |url=http://ijass.org/On_line/admin/files/2010.11.3.206.pdf |accessdate=November 3, 2011 |bibcode=2010IJASS..11..206L |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331074715/http://ijass.org/On_line/admin/files/2010.11.3.206.pdf |archivedate=March 31, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods of approach===

The two most common methods of approach for [[proximity operations]] are in-line with the flight path of the spacecraft (called V-bar, as it is along the velocity vector of the target) and [[orthogonal|perpendicular]] to the flight path along the line of the radius of the orbit (called R-bar, as it is along the radial vector, with respect to Earth, of the target).&lt;ref name=wertz2003&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Wertz|first=James R. |author2=Bell, Robert  |title=Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking Technologies – Status and Prospects |journal=SPIE AeroSense Symposium |date=2003 |series=Space Systems Technology and Operations Conference, Orlando Florida, April 21–25, 2003 |id=Paper 5088-3 |url=http://microcosminc.com/analysis/spie03.pdf |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The chosen method of approach depends on safety, spacecraft / thruster design, mission timeline, and, especially for docking with the ISS, on the location of the assigned docking port.

; V-bar approach
The V-bar approach is an approach of the "chaser" horizontally along the passive spacecraft's velocity vector. That is, from behind or from ahead, and in the same direction as the orbital motion of the passive target. The motion is [[wikt:parallel|parallel]] to the target's orbital velocity.&lt;ref name=wertz2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=pearson1989&gt;
{{cite web |last=Pearson|first=Don J. |title=Shuttle Rendezvous and Proximity Operations |date=November 1989 |url=http://home.comcast.net/~djpearson/rndz/rndzpaper.html |work=originally presented at COLLOQUE: MECANIQUE SPATIALE (SPACE DYNAMICS) TOULOUSE, FRANCE NOVEMBER 1989 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ref 'pearson1989' provides examples of V-bar and R-bar approaches, without definitions --&gt;
In the V-bar approach from behind, the chaser fires small thrusters to increase its velocity in the direction of the target. This, of course, also drives the chaser to a higher orbit. To keep the chaser on the V-vector, other thrusters are fired in the radial direction. If this is omitted (for example due to a thruster failure), the chaser will be carried to a higher orbit, which is associated with an orbital velocity lower than the target's. Consequently, the target moves faster than the chaser and the distance between them increases. This is called a ''natural braking effect'', and is a natural safeguard in case of a thruster failure.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

[[STS-104]] was the third [[Space Shuttle]] mission to conduct a V-bar arrival at the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/archives/sts-104/crew/inthobaugh.html | title = STS-104 Crew Interviews with Charles Hobaugh, Pilot | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The V-bar, or [[Orbital state vectors|velocity vector]], extends along a line directly ahead of the station. Shuttles approach the ISS along the V-bar when docking at the [[Pressurized Mating Adapter|PMA-2]] docking port.&lt;ref name=harwood&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/station/stage5a1/010309fd2/ |title=Shuttle Discovery nears rendezvous with station |publisher=SPACEFLIGHT NOW |author=WILLIAM HARWOOD |date=March 9, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; R-bar approach
The R-bar approach consists of the chaser moving below or above the target spacecraft, along its radial vector. The motion is [[orthogonal]] to the orbital velocity of the passive spacecraft.&lt;ref name=wertz2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=pearson1989/&gt;&lt;!-- ref 'pearson1989' provides examples of V-bar and R-bar approaches, without definitions --&gt;
When below the target the chaser fires radial thrusters to close in on the target. By this it increases its altitude. However, the orbital velocity of the chaser remains unchanged (thruster firings in the radial direction have no effect on the orbital velocity). Now in a slightly higher position, but with an orbital velocity that does not correspond to the local circular velocity, the chaser slightly falls behind the target. Small rocket pulses in the orbital velocity direction are necessary to keep the chaser along the radial vector of the target. If these rocket pulses are not executed (for example due to a thruster failure), the chaser will move away from the target. This is a ''natural braking effect''. For the R-bar approach, this effect is stronger than for the V-bar approach, making the R-bar approach the safer one of the two.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
Generally, the R-bar approach from below is preferable, as the chaser is in a lower (faster) orbit than the target, and thus "catches up" with it. For the R-bar approach from above, the chaser is in a higher (slower) orbit than the target, and thus has to wait for the target to approach it.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

[[Astrotech]] proposed meeting ISS cargo needs with a vehicle which would approach the station, "using a traditional nadir R-bar approach."&lt;ref&gt;

; Z-bar approach
An approach of the active, or "chaser," spacecraft horizontally from the side and orthogonal to the [[Orbital elements|orbital plane]] of the passive spacecraft—that is, from the side and out-of-plane of the orbit of the passive spacecraft—is called a Z-bar approach.&lt;ref name=bessel1993&gt;

'''Subjective validation''', sometimes called '''personal validation effect''', is a [[cognitive bias]] by which a person will consider a statement or another piece of information to be correct if it has any personal meaning or significance to them.&lt;ref&gt;Forer, B.R.

{{Art and video games}}

'''Video game art''' is a specialized form of [[computer art]] employing [[video game]]s as the [[artistic medium]]. Video game art often involves the use of [[Patch (computing)|patched]] or [[Mod (video gaming)|modified video games]] or the repurposing of existing games or game structures, however it relies on a broader range of artistic techniques and outcomes than [[Art mod|artistic modification]] and it may also include painting, sculpture, appropriation, in-game intervention and performance, sampling, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/936302522|title=Works of Game.|last=John.|first=Sharp,|date=2016-01-01|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262029070|oclc=936302522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876434897|title=Videogames and Art|last=Andy,|first=Clarke,|last2=Grethe,|first2=Mitchell,|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Intellect|isbn=9781841504193|oclc=876434897}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It may also include the creation of [[art game]]s either from scratch or by modifying existing games. Notable examples of video game art include [[Cory Arcangel]]'s "Super Mario Clouds" and "I Shot Andy Warhol,"&lt;ref name="CM"&gt;Andy Clarke and Grethe Mitchell (eds.),''Videogames and Art'' (Intellect Books, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Delappe]]'s projects including "Dead in Iraq" and the "Salt Satyagraha Online: Gandhi's March to Dandi in Second Life,"&lt;ref&gt;Mail Away: War Correspondence at Home and Away, by Lindsay Kelley, in the Media-N Journal of the New Media Caucus {{cite web|url=http://www.newmediacaucus.org/html/journal/issues.php?f%3Dpapers%26time%3D2009_summer%26page%3Dkelley |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518135157/http://www.newmediacaucus.org/html/journal/issues.php?f=papers&amp;time=2009_summer&amp;page=kelley |archivedate=May 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Salt Satyahgraha by Joseph Delappe - review by Natasha Chuk, in Furtherfield http://www.furtherfield.org/netbehaviour/salt-satyagraha-joseph-delappe-review-natasha-chuk&lt;/ref&gt; the 2004-2005 Rhizome Commissions "relating to the theme of games,"&lt;ref&gt;Rhizome Commissions http://rhizome.org/commissions/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paolo Pedercini]]'s [[Molleindustria]] games such as "Unmanned" and "[[Every Day the Same Dream]]", and [[Ian Bogost]]'s "[[Cow Clicker|Cowclicker]]."

Artistic modifications are frequently made possible through the use of [[level editor]]s, though other techniques exist. Some artists make use of [[machinima]] applications to produce non-interactive animated artworks, however artistic modification is not synonymous with machinima as these form only a small proportion of artistic modifications.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Machinima is distinct from art mods as it relies on different tools, though there are many similarities with some art mods.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Like video games, artistic game modifications are often interactive and may allow for single-player or multiplayer experience. Multiplayer works make use of networked environments to develop new kinds of interaction and collaborative art production.

==Techniques==
===Machinima===
{{Main|Machinima}}
[[File:Machinima sample reindeer full size.ogg|thumb|Right|[[Machinima]] filmed in [[Second life]]]]

Machinima is the use of real-time [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] (3-D) graphics [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] engines to generate [[computer animation]]. The term also refers to works that incorporate this animation technique.

===In-game intervention and performance===
Artists may intervene in online games in a non-play manner, often disrupting games in progress in order to challenge or expose underlying conventions and functions of game play. Examples of this include [[Anne Marie Schleiner]]'s ''Velvet-Strike'' (a project designed to allow players of realistic first person shooter games to use anti-war graffiti within the game to make an artistic statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensorcery.net/velvet-strike |title=Velvet-Strike |publisher=Opensorcery.net |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''Dead in Iraq'' (an art project created by Joseph DeLappe in which the player character purposely allows himself to be shot and then recites the names of US soldiers who have died in the Iraq War&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unr.edu/art/DELAPPE/Gaming/Dead_In_Iraq/dead_in_iraq%20JPEGS.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 5, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206122903/http://www.unr.edu/art/DELAPPE/Gaming/Dead_In_Iraq/dead_in_iraq%20JPEGS.html |archivedate=December 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Site-specific installations and site-relative mods===
[[Site-specific art|Site-specific]] [[Installation art|installations]] and site-relative [[Mod (computer gaming)|gaming modifications]] ("mods"), replicate real-world places (often the art gallery in which they are displayed) to explore similarities and differences between real and virtual worlds. An example is ''What It Is Without the Hand That Wields It'', where blood from kills in Counterstrike manifests and spills into a real life gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=8/23/06 4:15pm 8/23/06 4:15pm |url=http://kotaku.com/375624/a-counter+strike-game-that-spills-real-fake-blood |title=People Actually Lamer Than Stuart Scott Rip On Stuart Scott |publisher=Kotaku.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real-time performance instruments===
Video games can be incorporated into live audio and visual performance using a variety of instruments and computers such as keyboards embedded with music chips.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} See also [[chiptune]] and the [[Fijuu]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fijuu.com |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017041501/http://fijuu.com/ |archivedate=October 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generative art mods===
Generative art mods exploit the real-time capabilities of game technologies to produce ever-renewing autonomous artworks.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Examples include [[Julian Oliver]]'s ''[[ioq3apaint]]'', a generative painting system that uses the actions of software agents in combat to drive the painting process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver |first=Julian |url=http://julianoliver.com |title=Julian Oliver |publisher=Julian Oliver |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://selectparks.net/~julian/ioq3apaint ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512053311/http://selectparks.net/~julian/ioq3apaint |date=May 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alison Mealy]]'s ''[[UnrealArt]]'' which takes the movements of game entities and uses them to control a drawing process in an external program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=風紀委員 posted by alisonmealey.com on 2014年2月20日 |url=http://alisonmealey.com |title=色々な風俗がありますが全部が魅力的すぎます |publisher=Alisonmealey.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrealart.co.uk |title=will be back online soon |publisher=Unreal Art |date=2014-01-16 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kent Sheely]]'s "Cities in Flux," a [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]] mod that glitches and distorts the game's world in real-time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentsheely.com/dpad2012 |title=Viewer-generated screenshots: "Cities in Flux" – D-Pad Toronto 2012 // kent sheely |publisher=Kentsheely.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[RetroYou]]'s ''[[R/C Racer]]'' a modification of the graphic elements of a racing game which results in rich fields of colour and shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retroyou.org |title=full void |publisher=Retroyou.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retroyou.org/rc.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611041938/http://www.retroyou.org/rc.html |date=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''young adult''' is generally a person ranging in age from their late teens or early twenties to their thirties, although definitions and opinions, such as [[Erik Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of human development]], vary. The young [[adult]] stage in human development precedes [[middle age|middle adulthood]]. A person in the middle adulthood stage ages from 40 or 41 to 64. In [[old age]], a person is 65 years old or older.&lt;ref name="Martin Briner"&gt;Martin Briner, [http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501erik.htm Erik Erikson page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821183134/http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501erik.htm |date=2006-08-21 }}, 1999, on Briner's [http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501learn.htm site about learning theories] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007042838/http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501learn.htm |date=2006-10-07 }}, USMA Department of Mathematical Sciences, Center for Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), United States Military Academy at West Point. Accessed 24 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time co-ordinates==
For a variety of reasons, timeliness on young adulthood cannot be exactly defined—producing different results according to the different mix of overlapping indices (legal, maturational, occupational, sexual, emotional and the like) employed, or on whether 'a ''developmental perspective''... [or] the ''socialization perspective''&lt;ref name=Levinson1986&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levinson |first1=Daniel J. |title=A conception of adult development |journal=American Psychologist |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=1986 |pages=3–13 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.41.1.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is taken. 'Sub-phases in this timetable of psychosocial growth patterns... are not rigid, and both social change and individual variations must be taken into account'{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=46}}—not to mention regional and cultural differences. Arguably indeed, with people living longer, and also reaching puberty earlier, 'age norms for major life events have become highly elastic'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=15}} by the twenty-first century.

Some have suggested that, after {{'}}''Pre-adulthood''... in the first 20 years or so... the second era, ''Early Adulthood'', lasts from about age 17 to 45... the adult era of greatest energy and abundance and of greatest contradiction and stress.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; Within that framework, 'the ''Early Adult Transition'' (17–22) is a developmental bridge between pre-adulthood and early adulthood',&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; recognizing that 'the transition into adulthood is not a clear-cut dividing line'.{{sfn|Zastrow|Kirst-Ashman|2009|p=411}} One might alternatively speak of 'a ''Provisional Adulthood (18–30)''... [&amp;] the initiation to First Adulthood'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=10}}{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=59}} as following that.

Despite all such fluidity, there is broad agreement that it is essentially the twenties and thirties which constitute {{'}}''Early adulthood''... the basis for what [[Daniel Levinson|Levinson]] calls ''the Dream''—a vision of his [or her] goal's in life which provide motivation and enthusiasm for the future'.{{sfn|Birch|1997|p=220}}

==Health==
Young/prime adulthood can be considered the healthiest time of life{{sfn|Zastrow|Kirst-Ashman|2009|p=411}} and young adults are generally in good health, subject neither to [[disease]] nor the problems of [[senescence]]. Strength and [[Physical fitness|physical performance]] reach their peak from 18–39 years of age.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tarpenning KM, Hamilton-Wessler M, Wiswell RA, Hawkins SA |title=Endurance training delays age of decline in leg strength and muscle morphology |journal=Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=74–8 |year=2004 |pmid=14707771 |doi=10.1249/01.MSS.0000106179.73735.A6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Knechtle B, Rüst CA, Rosemann T, Lepers R |title=Age-related changes in 100-km ultra-marathon running performance |journal=Age |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=1033–45 |year=2012 |pmid=21796378 |pmc=3682063 |doi=10.1007/s11357-011-9290-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flexibility (anatomy)|Flexibility]] may decrease with age throughout adulthood.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Association of Flexibility, Balance, and Lumbar Strength with Balance Ability: Risk of Falls in Older Adults|first1=Emilio J.

Women reach their peak [[fertility]] in their early 20s.&lt;ref&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|001191|Infertility}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*At age 30
**75% will have a conception ending in a live birth within one year

In [[developed countries]], [[mortality rate]]s for the 18–40 age group are typically very low. Men are more likely to die at this age than women, particularly in the 18–25 group: reasons include [[car accidents]] and [[suicide]]. Mortality statistics among men and women level off during the late twenties and thirties, due in part to good health and less [[recklessness (psychology)|risk-taking behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Life Expectancy Profiles  | work =  | publisher = BBC  | date=   6 June 2005  | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3784854  | accessdate = 2007-06-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding disease, [[cancer]] is much less common in young than in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = UK cancer mortality statistics by age| publisher = Cancer Research UK  |date=May 2007| url = http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/mortality/age/  | accessdate = 2007-06-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions are [[testicular cancer]], [[cervical cancer]], and [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Cancers at a glance | publisher = Cancer Research UK  |date=May 2007| url = http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerandresearch/cancers/  | accessdate = 2007-06-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] has hit the early adult population particularly hard. According to a [[United Nations]] report, AIDS has significantly increased mortality of between ages 20 to 55 for African males and 20 to 45 for African females, reducing the [[life expectancy]] in South Africa by 18 years and in Botswana by 34 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |author1=Ngom, Pierre  |author2=Clark, Samuel   |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Adult Mortality In The Era Of HIV/AIDS: Sub-Saharan Africa  | publisher = Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations Secretariat  | date=  18 August 2003 | url = https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/adultmort/CLARK_Paper3.pdf  | format = pdf  | accessdate = 2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early adulthood==
According to Erikson, in the wake of the adolescent emphasis upon [[identity formation]], 'the young adult, emerging from the search for and insistence on identity, is eager and willing to fuse their identity with that of others. He [or she] is ready for [[intimacy]], that is, the capacity to commit... to concrete affiliations and partnerships.'{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=255}} To do so means the ability 'to face the fear of ego loss in situations which call for self-abandon: in the solidarity of close affiliations, in orgasms and [[sex|sexual unions]], in close friendships and in physical combat'.{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=155}} Avoidance of such experiences 'because of a fear of ego-loss may lead to a deep sense of [[solitude|isolation]] and consequent self-absorption'.{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=155}}

Where isolation is avoided, the young adult may find instead that 'satisfactory sex relations... in some way take the edge off the hostilities and potential rages caused by the oppositeness of male and female, of fact and fancy, of [[love]] and hate';{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=257}} and may grow into the ability to exchange intimacy, love and [[compassion]].

In modern societies, young adults in their late teens and early 20s encounter a number of issues as they finish school and begin to hold full-time jobs and take on other responsibilities of adulthood; and 'the young adult is usually preoccupied with self-growth in the context of society and relationships with others.'{{sfn|Birch|1997|p=227}} The danger is that in 'the second era, ''Early Adulthood''... we must make crucially important choices regarding marriage, family, work, and lifestyle before we have the maturity or life experience to choose wisely.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;

While 'young adulthood is filled with avid quests for intimate relationships and other major commitments involving career and life goals', there is also "a parallel pursuit for the formulation of a set of moral values".{{sfn|Zastrow|Kirst-Ashman|2009|p=298}} Erikson has argued that it is only now that what he calls the 'ideological mind' of adolescence gives way to 'that ''[[Ethics|ethical]] sense'' which is the mark of the adult.'{{sfn|Erikson|1975|pp=254–6}}

Reaching adulthood in modern society is not always a linear or clean transition. As generations continue to adapt, new markers of adulthood are created that add different social expectations of what it means to be an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vandegrift |first1=Darcie |title='We don't have any limits': Russian young adult life narratives through a social generations lens |journal=Journal of Youth Studies |volume=19 |issue=2 |year=2015 |pages=221–36 |doi=10.1080/13676261.2015.1059930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age 30 transition==

Daniel Levinson suggested that the first phase of early adulthood comes to a close around twenty-eight to thirty, when 'at about 28 the provisional character of the twenties is ending and life is becoming more serious... the ''age-thirty crisis''.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; between age 28 and 32', stressing that 'it is not uncommon, at the approach to the thirties, to tear up the life structure one put together to support the original dream of the twenties,'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=47}} and to start anew—'to create the basis for the next life structure.&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;
When 'the Age Thirty Transition' is a difficult one, 'in a severe crisis [s/]he experiences a threat to life itself, the danger of chaos and dissolution, the loss of hope for the future.&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;

==Settling down==
After the relative upheaval of the early 30s, the middle to late 30s are often characterized by '''settling down''': 'the establishment phase', involving 'what we would call ''major life investments''—work, family, friends, community activities, and values.'{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=46}}{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=72}} What has been termed 'the ''Culminating Life Structure for Early Adulthood'' (33–40) is the vehicle for completing this era and realizing our youthful aspirations.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; People in their thirties may increase the financial and emotional investments they make in their lives, and may have been employed long enough to gain promotions and raises. They often become more focused on advancing their careers and gaining stability in their personal lives—'with marriage and child-rearing,'{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=46}} starting a [[family]], coming to the fore as priorities.

[[Gail Sheehy]], however, signposts the same twenties/thirties division rather differently, arguing that nowadays 'the twenties have stretched out into a long Provisional Adulthood', and that in fact 'the transition to the Turbulent Thirties marks the initiation to First Adulthood.'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=55}}{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=59}}

==Midlife transition==

Young Adulthood then draws to its close with 'the ''Midlife Transition'', from roughly age 40 to 45'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;—producing 'a brand-new passage in the forties, when First Adulthood ends and Second Adulthood begins.'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=14}}
