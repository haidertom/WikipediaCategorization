In [[computer programming]], especially [[functional programming]] and [[type theory]], an '''algebraic data type''' is a kind of [[composite type]], i.e., a type formed by combining other types.

Two common classes of algebraic types are [[product type]]s (i.e., [[tuple]]s and [[record (computer science)|records]]) and [[sum type]]s (i.e., tagged or disjoint unions or ''variant types'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/manual003.html#toc7 Records and variants] - OCaml manual section 1.4{{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[value (computer science)|values]] of a product type typically contain several values, called ''fields''.  All values of that type have the same combination of field types.  The set of all possible values of a product type is the set-theoretic product, i.e., the [[Cartesian product]], of the sets of all possible values of its field types.

The values of a sum type are typically grouped into several classes, called ''variants''.  A value of a variant type is usually created with a quasi-functional entity called a ''constructor''.  Each variant has its own constructor, which takes a specified number of arguments with specified types.  The set of all possible values of a sum type is the set-theoretic sum, i.e., the [[disjoint union]], of the sets of all possible values of its variants. [[Enumerated type]]s are a special case of sum types in which the constructors take no arguments, as exactly one value is defined for each constructor.

Values of algebraic types are analyzed with [[pattern matching]], which identifies a value by its constructor or field names and extracts the data it contains.

Algebraic data types were introduced in [[Hope (programming language)|Hope]], a small functional programming language developed in the 1970s at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |quote=Presentations included Rod Burstall, Dave MacQueen, and Don Sannella on Hope, the language that introduced algebraic data types |title=A history of Haskell: being lazy with class |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1238856 |author1=Paul Hudak |author2=John Hughes |author3=Simon Peyton Jones |author4=Philip Wadler |booktitle=Proceedings of the third ACM SIGPLAN conference on History of programming languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One of the most common examples of  an algebraic data type is the singly linked list. A list type is a sum type with two variants, &lt;code&gt;Nil&lt;/code&gt; for an empty list and &lt;code&gt;Cons ''x'' ''xs''&lt;/code&gt; for the combination of a new element ''x'' with a list ''xs'' to create a new list. Here is an example of how a singly linked list would be declared in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Cons&lt;/code&gt; is an abbreviation of ''cons''truct. Many languages have special syntax for lists defined in this way. For example, Haskell and [[ML (programming language)|ML]] use &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Nil&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Cons&lt;/code&gt;, respectively, and square brackets for entire lists. So &lt;code&gt;Cons 1 (Cons 2 (Cons 3 Nil))&lt;/code&gt; would normally be written as &lt;code&gt;1:2:3:[]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[1,2,3]&lt;/code&gt; in Haskell, or as &lt;code&gt;1::2::3::[]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[1;2;3]&lt;/code&gt; in ML.

For a slightly more complex example, [[binary tree]]s may be implemented in Haskell as follows:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Tree = Empty
          | Leaf Int
          | Node Tree Tree
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, &lt;code&gt;Empty&lt;/code&gt; represents an empty tree, &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt; contains a piece of data, and &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; organizes the data into branches.

In most languages that support algebraic data types, it is possible to define [[parametric polymorphism|parametric]] types. Examples are given later in this article.

Somewhat similar to a function, a data constructor is applied to arguments of an appropriate type, yielding an instance of the data type to which the type constructor belongs. For example, the data constructor &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt; is logically a function &lt;code&gt;Int -&gt; Tree&lt;/code&gt;, meaning that giving an integer as an argument to &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt; produces a value of the type &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt;. As &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; takes two arguments of the type &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; itself, the datatype is [[recursive type|recursive]].

Operations on algebraic data types can be defined by using [[pattern matching]] to retrieve the arguments. For example, consider a function to find the depth of a &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt;, given here in Haskell:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 depth :: Tree -&gt; Int
 depth Empty = 0
 depth (Leaf n) = 1
 depth (Node l r) = 1 + max (depth l) (depth r)
&lt;/source&gt;

Thus, a &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; given to &lt;code&gt;depth&lt;/code&gt; can be constructed using any of &lt;code&gt;Empty&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; and must be matched for any of them respectively to deal with all cases. In case of &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt;, the pattern extracts the subtrees &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; for further processing.

Algebraic data types are highly suited to implementing [[abstract syntax]].  For example, the following algebraic data type describes a simple language representing numerical expressions:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Expression = Number Int
                | Add Expression Expression
                | Minus Expression Expression
                | Mult Expression Expression
                | Divide Expression Expression
&lt;/source&gt;

An element of such a data type would have a form such as &lt;code&gt;Mult (Add (Number 4) (Minus (Number 0) (Number 1))) (Number 2)&lt;/code&gt;.

Writing an evaluation function for this language is a simple exercise; however, more complex transformations also become feasible.  For example, an optimization pass in a compiler might be written as a function taking an abstract expression as input and returning an optimized form.

==Explanation==
What is happening is that there is a datatype which can be ''one of several types of things''. Each ''type of thing'' is associated with an identifier called a ''constructor'', which can be viewed as a kind of tag for that kind of data. Each constructor can carry with it a different type of data. A constructor could carry no data (e.g., "Empty" in the example above), or one piece of data (e.g., “Leaf” has one Int value), or multiple pieces of data (e.g., “Node” has two Tree values).

To do something with a value of this Tree algebraic data type, it is ''deconstructed'' using a process termed ''pattern matching''. It involves ''matching'' the data with a series of ''patterns''. The example function "depth" above pattern-matches its argument with three patterns. When the function is called, it finds the first pattern that matches its argument, performs any variable bindings that are found in the pattern, and evaluates the expression corresponding to the pattern.

Each pattern above has a form that resembles the structure of some possible value of this datatype. The first pattern simply matches values of the constructor ''Empty''. The second pattern matches values of the constructor ''Leaf''. Patterns are recursive, so then the data that is associated with that constructor is matched with the pattern "n". In this case, a lowercase identifier represents a pattern that matches any value, which then is bound to a variable of that name — in this case, a variable “&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;” is bound to the integer value stored in the data type — to be used in the expression to evaluate.

The recursion in patterns in this example are trivial, but a possible more complex recursive pattern would be something like &lt;code&gt;&lt;source lang="lisp" enclose="none"&gt;Node (Node (Leaf 4) x) (Node y (Node Empty z))&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Recursive patterns several layers deep are used for example in balancing [[red-black tree]]s, which involve cases that require looking at colors several layers deep.

The example above is operationally equivalent to the following pseudocode:

 switch on (data.constructor)
   case Empty:
     return 0
   case Leaf:
     let n = data.field1
     return 1
   case Node:
     let l = data.field1
     let r = data.field2
     return 1 + max (depth l) (depth r)

The comparison of this with pattern matching will point out some of the advantages of algebraic data types and pattern matching. The first advantage is [[type safety]]. The pseudocode above relies on the diligence of the programmer to not access &lt;tt&gt;field2&lt;/tt&gt; when the constructor is a Leaf, for example. Also, the type of &lt;tt&gt;field1&lt;/tt&gt; is different for Leaf and Node (for Leaf it is &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt;; for Node it is &lt;tt&gt;Tree&lt;/tt&gt;), so the type system would have difficulties assigning a static type to it in a safe way in a traditional [[record (computer science)|record]] data structure. However, in pattern matching, the type of each extracted value is checked based on the types declared by the relevant constructor, and how many values can be extracted is known based on the constructor, so it does not face these problems.

Second, in pattern matching, the compiler statically checks that all cases are handled. If one of the cases of the ''depth'' function above were missing, the compiler would issue a warning, indicating that a case is not handled. This task may seem easy for the simple patterns above, but with many complex recursive patterns, the task becomes difficult for the average human (or compiler, if it must check arbitrary nested if-else constructs) to handle. Similarly, there may be patterns which never match (i.e., are already covered by prior patterns), and the compiler can also check and issue warnings for these, as they may indicate an error in reasoning.

Do not confuse these patterns with [[regular expression]] patterns used in string pattern matching. The purpose is similar: to check whether a piece of data matches certain constraints, and if so, extract relevant parts of it for processing. However, the mechanism is very different. This kind of pattern matching on algebraic data types matches on the structural properties of an object rather than on the character sequence of strings.

==Theory==
{{main|Recursive data type}}

A general algebraic data type is a possibly recursive [[sum type]] of [[product type]]s. Each constructor tags a product type to separate it from others, or if there is only one constructor, the data type is a product type. Further, the parameter types of a constructor are the factors of the product type. A parameterless constructor corresponds to the [[empty product]]. If a datatype is recursive, the entire sum of products is wrapped in a [[recursive type]], and each constructor also rolls the datatype into the recursive type.

For example, the Haskell datatype:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
&lt;/source&gt;

is represented in [[type theory]] as
&lt;math&gt;\lambda \alpha. \mu \beta. 1 + \alpha \times \beta&lt;/math&gt;
with constructors &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nil}_\alpha = \mathrm{roll}\ (\mathrm{inl}\ \langle\rangle)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cons}_\alpha\ x\ l = \mathrm{roll}\ (\mathrm{inr}\ \langle x, l\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;.

The Haskell List datatype can also be represented in type theory in a slightly different form, thus:
&lt;math&gt;\mu \phi. \lambda \alpha. 1 + \alpha \times \phi\ \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
(Note how the &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; constructs are reversed relative to the original.) The original formation specified a type function which body was a recursive type. The revised version specifies a recursive function on types. (The type variable &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is used to suggest a function rather than a ''base type'' like &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is like a Greek ''f''.) The function must also now be applied &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; to its argument type &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the body of the type.

For the purposes of the List example, these two formulations are not significantly different; but the second form allows expressing so-called [[nested data type]]s, i.e., those where the recursive type differs parametrically from the original. (For more information on nested data types, see the works of [[Richard Bird (computer scientist)|Richard Bird]], [[Lambert Meertens]], and Ross Paterson.)

In [[set theory]] the equivalent of a sum type is a [[disjoint union]], a set which elements are pairs consisting of a tag (equivalent to a constructor) and an object of a type corresponding to the tag (equivalent to the constructor arguments).

'''Artmedia''' was one of the first scientific projects concerning the relationship between art, technology, philosophy and [[aesthetics]]. It was founded in 1985 at the [[University of Salerno]]. For over two decades, until 2009, dozens of projects, studies, exhibitions and conferences on new technologies&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the ten international "Artmedia" conferences, which took place in Salerno and Paris from 1985 to 2008, the Laboratory has led to numerous other initiatives and events, such as "L'immaginario tecnologico", 1984 (conference and exhibition); "Technettronica", 1989 (Exhibition about the Aesthetics of Communication); "Estetica e antropologia", 1983 (International Symposium); "Tecnologie e forme nell'arte e nella scienza", 2003 (International Symposium); "New Technologies: Roy Ascott, Maurizio Bolognini, Fred Forest, Richard Kriesche, Mit Mitropoulos", Museo del Sannio, 2003 (Exhibition on the Aesthetics of Communication); "Estetica e tecnologia", 1987 (Symposium); "L'immateriale in piazza" (Aitiani, Forest, Mitropoulos, Grossi, Prado), Naples, 1992 (Exhibition on the Aesthetics of Communication); "Un'estetica per i media" 1989 (RAI, Dipartimento Scuola Educazione, TV program); "Cartacarbone", 1990 (radio program); "Coincidences", 1995 (Aesthetics journal, in French); "Epiphaneia", 1995-1996 (Aesthetics journal, in Italian). See ''Edition spéciale Artmedia'', "Art Press", Paris, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; made Artmedia a reference point for many internationally renowned scholars and artists,&lt;ref&gt;A. R., ''Des hauts et débats. Colloque Artmedia VIII'', "Liberation", November 29, 2002, p. 13; ''Dossier: De l’esthétique de la communication au Net Art'', "Art Press", 285, November 2002, pp. 37-43.&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to the growing cultural interest in the aesthetics of [[New media|media]], the aesthetics of [[Computer network|networks]], and their [[ethical]] and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] implications.

==Beginnings and international events==
Since the late 1970s, a permanent ''Seminar of the Aesthetics of Media and Communication'' has been directed by its founder [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] at the University of Salerno. The basic principles of the aesthetics of technological communication were identified and conceptualized in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;The history of the "aesthetics of communication", especially upon its debut in the 1980s, is recorded in the book by Mario Costa,''The Aesthetics of Communication. Aesthetic use of simultaneity at a distance'', Rome, Castelvecchi, 1999; its basic principles, formulated by Costa, were expressed for the first time in ''News and Notes'', published by the International Center of Aesthetic Communication, Salerno, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; A conference on "Technological Imaginary", held in 1984 at the Museo del Sannio in [[Benevento]], discussed the issue of the new relationship between art and technology and the consequent need to re-evaluate aesthetics, warning that "all our future existence will be played at the crossroads between technology and imaginary".&lt;ref&gt;"Aa. Vv., ''L’immaginario tecnologico'', Museo del Sannio, Benevento, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The comprehensive relationship between art and [[technoscience]], technology, and philosophy has also been the theoretical subject of the ten international "Artmedia" conferences which were held in Salerno and Paris between 1985 and 2008. Particularly relevant were conferences held in Paris between 2002 and 2008, which took place at the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]], the [[Bibliotheque Nationale de France]] (BNF) and the Institut National d'Histoire de l 'Art (INHA), with the partnership of the Société Française d'Esthétique, the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]], the [[University of Toronto]], the [[Universidade de São Paulo]], the [[Sorbonne University|Université de Paris 1 Sorbonne]], and the U.S. magazine [[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]].&lt;ref&gt;See Mario Costa, Fred Forest (eds) (2011), ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique dans l'art contemporain ou le destin du sens'', Paris: Institut National Audiovisuel, Editions L'Harmattan, and ''Dossier Artmedia VIII'', in "Ligeia", Paris, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuous debate between artists and theorists==

Artmedia wanted to gather theorists and artists from all over the world and encourage both joint and complementary work, beginning with the need to give attention to theoretical and artistic practices and developing both together. These also contributed towards spreading the spirit of the project, both in a number of festivals and shows, and through their own artworks and research.&lt;ref&gt;Antonella Fimiani, ''Arte &amp; tecnologia, la frontiera-Salerno'', in "Il Mattino", November 24, 1999, p. 23; Sylvie Lisiecki e Marie Saladin, ''Fenetrês sur les arts numériques'', in "Croniques de la Bibliothèque Nationale de France", 46, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists who worked with Artmedia and participated in its activities included [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[René Berger]], [[Abraham Moles]], [[Derrick De Kerckhove]], [[Pierre Levy]], Gillo Dorfles, [[Paul Virilio]], [[Frank Popper]], [[Roger Malina]], Daniel Charles, José Jiménez, Anne Cauquelin, [[Edgar Morin]], [[Thierry de Duve]], [[Catherine Millet]], Filiberto Menna, Andreas Broeckmann, Rudolf zur Lippe, [[Edmond Couchot]], Dominique Chateau, Yannick Geffroy, Philippe Queau, Arlindo Machado, Tetsuo Kogawa, and Bernard Teyssedre.

Artists included [[Fred Forest]], [[Roy Ascott]], [[Takahiko Iimura]], [[Maurizio Bolognini]], [[Tom Klinkowstein]], Tom Sherman, [[Eduardo Kac]], Enzo Minarelli, [[James Dashow]], [[Peter D'Agostino]], Mit Mitropoulos, [[Shawn Brixey]], Bruno Di Bello, [[Antoni Muntadas]], [[Orlan]], Kit Galloway, [[David Rokeby]], [[Miguel Chevalier]], [[Norman White]], Richard Kriesche, Olivier Auber, [[Caterina Davinio]] and [[Casey Reas]].&lt;ref&gt;On the participation of artists and theorists, see in particular: Mario Costa, Fred Forest (eds) (2011), ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique dans l'art contemporain ou le destin du sens'', Paris: Institut National Audiovisuel, Editions L'Harmattan; Mario Costa (ed.) (2004), ''New Technologies: [[Roy Ascott]], Maurizio Bolognini, [[Fred Forest]], Richard Kriesche, Mit Mitropoulos'', Salerno: Artmedia, Museo del Sannio; ''Dossier Artmedia VIII'', in "Ligeia", Paris, 2002, pp. 21-245; ''Edition spéciale Artmedia'', "Art Press", Paris, 2002; see also the OLATS/Leonardo websites: http://www.olats.org/projetpart/artmedia/2002/mono_index.php and http://www.olats.org/projetpart/artmedia/2008/mono_index.php .&lt;/ref&gt;

The questions raised in various projects promoted by Artmedia, in a continuous dialogue between artists and theorists, led to discussions on topics including ''Aesthetics of Communication and the anthropology of the future'' (1985), ''Global aesthetic communication'' (1986), ''Electronic performativity and the art system'' (1990), ''Neo-technological arts between aesthetics and communication'' (1992), ''Aesthetic research and technology'' (1995), ''Developments in aesthetics: change or mutation?'' (1999), ''From the Aesthetics of Communication to Net art'' (2002), and ''Ethics, aesthetics and techno-communication. The future of meaning'' (2008).

All Artmedia symposiums have been followed by many publications. For the two held in Paris, a complete video recording is also available, and can be viewed at the [[Institut National de l'Audiovisuel]].

An assessment of 25 years of Artmedia activity was made into a seminar on ''The aesthetic object of the future'', held at the [[University of Salerno]] in 2009. The Artmedia project produced a large number of publications and documents that are being catalogued, with a view to their proper placement and use.

The '''Baldin Collection''' is a group of 364 [[masterpiece]]s removed from Germany to the Soviet Union by Russian Army officer Victor Baldin at the end of [[World War II]]. The ensemble consists of 362 drawings and 2 paintings by [[Dürer]], [[van Gogh]], [[Manet]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Rubens]], [[Titian]] and other famous artists. Historically part of the collection at the [[Kunsthalle Bremen]], the Baldin group came from a much larger cache of artworks stored by the Germans in a [[Brandenburg]] castle to protect it from [[Bombing of Bremen in World War II|air raids]]. In 1945 the castle was occupied by the [[Red Army]] and the storage vaults were looted, mainly by Russian soldiers but also by the local German population. The works Baldin took were then hidden at a Soviet Research Institute for many years. In 1991 the collection was moved to the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] where its existence was revealed to the world in 1992. It remains there today.

Since then the Baldin Collection has been regarded as [[looted art]] and is the subject of fierce debate among experts, between [[Germany]] and [[Russia]], and among politicians inside Russia itself. While Victor Baldin did steal the works, he is also credited with having saved them from destruction. For decades he appealed to senior officials, including Soviet leaders [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], to get them returned to Germany. In 1989 Baldin even traveled to [[Bremen]], [[West Germany]], to reveal the existence of the secret collection to the Kunsthalle. In the 1990s the government of [[Boris Yeltsin]] finally agreed to return the works, but subsequent Russian governments have blocked such plans. Today the Collection has been called "of singular importance to the entire issue of trophy art" by the Russians&lt;ref&gt;Interview of Mikhail Borisovich Piotrovsky, State Hermitage Museum Director: Interview in ''The Gazette'' 12 March 2003 Moscow [http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/02/hm2_6_0_3.html English summary at the website of the State Hermitage Museum]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206130013/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/02/hm2_6_0_3.html|date=6 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "[[cause célèbre]] of German-Russian Restitution Politics" by those who support its return.&lt;ref name = akinsha&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1017/S0940739110000111|title=Why Can't Private Art "Trophies" Go Home from the War?|year=2010|last1=Akinsha|first1=Konstantin|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|volume=17|issue=27|pages=257–290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Kunsthalle Bremen Collection ===
[[File:Kunsthalle-HB 20110824 img-01.jpg|thumb|330px|The [[Kunsthalle Bremen|Kunsthalle]] in [[Bremen]], Germany]]
At the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, the Bremen Art Museum (German: ''[[Kunsthalle Bremen]]'') was closed and its priceless paintings, drawings, prints, and sculpture were stored in the basement. [[Bremen]], an important manufacturing center, became an early target for [[Bombing of Bremen in World War II|Allied strategic bombing]]. On the night of 5 September 1942, a fire bomb destroyed the central staircase and six gallery rooms of the museum. It also burned a version of [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s famous painting ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'', which because of its size could not be moved. After this damage, the Kunsthalle collections were moved to more secure storage in various bank vaults underneath Bremen. In 1943, as bombing intensified, Bremen's mayor decreed that the museum's collections be moved to safety outside the city. The collection was divided up between four castles in Germany. A set of 50 paintings, 1715 drawings and 3000 prints were moved to Schloss Karnzow, the hunting lodge of Count von Königsmarck, near the small town of [[Kyritz]] north of [[Berlin]] in the [[Province of Brandenburg]].&lt;ref name = kunsthalle&gt;Kunsthalle Bremen: ''Geschichte 1914–1945'' [http://www.kunsthalle-bremen.de/kunsthalle/ueber-uns/geschichte/emil-waldmann-1914-1945/ online] {{icon de}} retrieved 3 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Karnzow Castle and Victor Baldin, 1945 ===
[[File:Albrecht Durer, "Woman's Bath".jpg|thumb|''Frauenbad'' by [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1496). Not part of the Baldin Collection itself, but taken by the same military unit from the same storage vaults at Karnzow Castle&lt;ref name = duerer/&gt;]]
After Germany's defeat, [[Brandenburg]] and specifically the area around Karnzow Castle was occupied by the [[Red Army]]. On 29 May 1945 soldiers and officers of the 38th Field Engineers' Brigade billeted at the Castle began looting it.&lt;ref name = akinsha/&gt; Victor Baldin, an Army captain and combat engineer, found opened boxes in the cellar, saw documents trampled on the floor, and observed soldiers lighting their way by using burning papers. Baldin, an art restorer before the war, recognized these as drawings by the great masters.&lt;ref name = novosti&gt;"Baldin's Collection and Restitution Problems" in: ''Russian News &amp; Information Agency RIA Novosti'' 8 December 2005 [http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20051208/42393080.html online version] {{en icon}} retrieved 2 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Baldin intervened and sealed the cellar. Scrutinizing the treasures lying about, he found works by [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]], [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Degas]], [[Dürer]], [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyke]], [[Van Gogh]], [[Goya]], [[Manet]], [[Raphael]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], [[Rubens]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Titian]].&lt;ref name=dolinina&gt;Kira Dolinina and Maia Stravinskaya: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184500/http://www.kommersant.com/p549322/r_1/Ministry_of_Culture_Won_t_Give_Back_What_Doesn_t_Belong_to_It/ "Ministry of Culture Won't Give Back What Doesn't Belong to It"].

Baldin became determined to save what he could. He later said "I started in on the beautiful things, then I saw it was all beautiful."&lt;ref name = latimes/&gt; He took drawings away from soldiers by force, by deception and in exchange for personal items.&lt;ref name=dieweltes/&gt; In one case, it took him three days to obtain a drawing of Christ's head by [[Albrecht Dürer]] from another officer. Baldin managed to coax the officer into exchanging it for his chrome boots.&lt;ref name = novosti/&gt; Of the thousands of works stored in the cellar, Baldin managed to save just 362 drawings and 2 paintings. Among them was the only known pen and ink study  by [[van Gogh]] of his famous painting, ''[[Starry Night]]''&lt;ref name = latimes/&gt; As the Soviet Army withdrew, the cellars were left open and what little remained of the collection was lost to local looters and the weather.&lt;ref name = kunsthalle/&gt;

Baldin's actions and motives are still debated today. He did indeed cut the drawings from their mounts, put them into a suitcase, carry them to Russia and hide them in his apartment. However, while at the castle Baldin also wrote down descriptions of every work he saw, copied the German signatures and labels, and later carefully documented their [[provenance]]. He also begged for an official military transport so the collection could be handled more securely, but none were available, and his request was denied.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hughes, Constance Richards, Rhea Schoenthal: "Spoils of War": ''Time Magazine'', 3 April 1995 [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982773,00.html abstract online] retrieved 2 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is generally agreed that Baldin's efforts rescued priceless [[masterpiece]]s from outright destruction. In addition, because of his specialized art knowledge, what would become known as the "Baldin Collection" became the most important part of the Kunsthalle collection remaining from Schloss Karnzow.&lt;ref name = novosti/&gt;

In contrast to Baldin's efforts, works looted by Baldin's comrades from Karnzow have been found as far afield as [[Azerbaijan]] and in varying states of decay. In the late 1990s eight disputed drawings, including the world-famous ''Frauenbad'' ("Women's Bathhouse") by Albrecht Dürer, were seized by [[United States Customs]] in an incident of [[black market]] trading.&lt;ref name = duerer&gt;Jo Ann Lewis, "Duerer, Drawing a Hot Bath" in: ''The Washington Post'', 26 October 1997, at G9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constance Lowenthal, ''U.S. Customs Recovers Old Masters Drawings'', IFAR Report, Oct. 1997, at 4&lt;/ref&gt; Today over 1,500 items from the Kunsthalle collection that were stored at Karnzow remain missing.&lt;ref name = clark/&gt;

=== Postwar period, 1946–1990 ===
After their return home, some of the officers who had participated in the looting at Karnzow donated their pieces to museums around the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1948 Baldin deposited his at the A. V. Shchusev State Scientific Research Museum of Architecture in [[Moscow]], where the masterpieces became a Soviet state secret.&lt;ref name = akinsha/&gt; Baldin worked as an art restorer at the museum and eventually became its general director in 1963, a post he held for 25 years.&lt;ref name = novosti/&gt;

Baldin then tried for decades to give the stolen art back to Germany. He took the courageous steps of writing to Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1973, to the chief ideologist of the Communist Party [[Yegor Ligachev]] in 1987, and many other Soviet political and cultural officials including [[Mikhail Suslov]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and [[Raisa Gorbachev]]&amp;nbsp;– all to no avail.&lt;ref name=ingram/&gt; In 1989, during the period of increased transparency in the Soviet Union known as [[perestroika]], Baldin took another unprecedented step. He traveled to Bremen, [[West Germany]], and met with the director of the Kunsthalle, Dr Siegfried Salzmann. The director was shocked to learn that important parts of the long lost collection had survived. With hands shaking, he read the list of the missing masterpieces that Baldin had prepared years before. Baldin had put pencil marks next to those works he had personally rescued. He has since been called the "hero of the story."&lt;ref name = novosti/&gt;

=== Post-Soviet period, 1991–2000 ===
In 1991, Baldin wrote to Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] and finally received his first reply, in which the president agreed it would be politically correct to return the works to Germany.&lt;ref name = novosti/&gt; However, that same year nationalist elements in the Russian government hurriedly transferred the collection to the State [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg]] in a cover-up attempt.&lt;ref name=dolinina/&gt; As of 2012 it is still unclear if one of the most famous works in the collection, ''Cypresses in [[Starry Night]]'' (1889) by Van Gogh, is at the Hermitage or remains in Moscow.&lt;ref name = clark/&gt;

In legal proceedings and political debates during the following years it appeared that collection might return to its rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Ann Lewis. "World War II German Art Hoard To Be Returned by Soviets; 360 Master Drawings Taken for Safekeeping" in: ''The Washington Post''. 16 August 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, a group of 101 pieces from another part of Baldin's brigade, including Albrecht Duerers' 1494 watercolor ''View of a Rock Castle by a River'', were returned to the Kunsthalle by Russia. This was followed by the simultaneous return of two artifacts of the [[Amber Room]], bought and financed by a Bremen businessman to speed up the process.&lt;ref name=finnbremen&gt;Peter Finn: "Bremen Basks In Return of Art Looted by Soviet Army" in: ''The Washington Post''. 24 November 2000, A Section&lt;/ref&gt; Anatoly Vilkov, from the Russian ministry of culture, stated that "Russia has no right to keep the Baldin collection. We did not receive this right through a gift, since by law the collection did not belong to the donor Baldin."&lt;ref name = schossig&gt;Rainer B.

=== Latest disputes, 2003–present ===

The potential return of the collection to Germany began to face increasing opposition from Russian nationalist leaders, including [[Communist]] legislator and former Culture Minister of the USSR [[Nikolai Gubenko]]. Gubenko had been one of those involved in the 1991 transfer of the art to the Hermitage to hide it.&lt;ref name=ingram/&gt; The State [[Duma]], which included Gubenko as a member,&lt;ref name=dieweltes/&gt; passed a non-binding resolution on 12 March 2003 asking President [[Vladimir Putin]] to prevent the Culture Ministry from returning the Baldin Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030503040021/http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2003/03/130303.asp "Duma Calls for Go-Slow Approach on Trophy Art"] ''Radio Free Europe Newsline'' 13 March 2003. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930063953/http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2003/03/130303.asp|date=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian Culture Minister Mikhail Shvydkoy opposed these moves to keep the collection in Russia; he regarded it as illegal loot based on a 1998 law that protected only those artworks from World War II taken by official Soviet trophy brigades and not private citizens. In 2003 he confirmed an order by the Russian General Prosecutor confirming a resolution of the [[Hanse]] Supreme court, which had decided the entire 364 remaining items were the official property of the Bremen Kunsthalle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsfromrussia.com/culture/2003/04/07/45701_.html "Russian Minister of Culture: Return of 'Baldin Collection' to Germany is Legally Relevant"].

As of 2010, it appeared that the collection would not be returning to Germany any time soon.&lt;ref name = akinsha/&gt;

== Legacy ==
According to a 2005 interview with Baldin's widow Julia Siwakowa, it was always his wish that the looted art be returned to the Kunsthalle. Baldin's last will stated: "The collection belongs to humankind, not only Germany, and as the collection was located at the Kunsthalle Bremen, it must be returned to this place."&lt;ref name=dieweltes/&gt; The history of Victor Baldin, the stolen paintings and their odyssey is featured in the 2007 book ''Victor Baldin&amp;nbsp;– The Man with the Suitcase/Victor Baldin&amp;nbsp;– Der Mann mit dem Koffer''.&lt;ref name = schossig/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2546">The '''bead theory''' is a disproved [[hypothesis]] that [[gene]]s are arranged on the [[chromosome]] like [[bead]]s on a [[necklace]]. This theory was first proposed by [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] after discovering [[Gene|genes]] through his work with breeding red and white eyed fruit flies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Thomas Hunt|date=1910|title=Sex Limited Inheritance in Drosophilia|url=http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/thm-10a.pdf|journal=Science|volume=32|pages=120-122|via=ESP.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the existence of a gene as a unit of inheritance is recognized through its mutant alleles. A mutant allele affects a single phenotypic character, maps to one chromosome locus, gives a mutant phenotype when paired and shows a Mendelian ratio when intercrossed. Several tenets of the bead theory are worth emphasizing :-
1. The gene is viewed as a '''fundamental unit of structure''', indivisible by crossing over. Crossing over take place between genes ( the beads in this model ) but never within them.
2. The gene is viewed as the '''fundamental unit of change or mutation'''. It changes in toto from one allelic form into another; there are no smaller components within it that can change.
3. The gene is viewed as the '''fundamental unit of function''' ( although the precise function of gene is not specified in this model ). Parts of a gene, if they exist cannot function. [[Guido Pontecorvo]] continued to work under the basis of this theory until 
[[Seymour Benzer]] showed in the 1950s that the bead theory was not correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siddoqi|first=Obaid|date=1999|title=Guido Pontecorvo (1907-1999)|url=https://link-springer-com.libproxy.mst.edu/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF02934463.pdf|journal=Journal of Genetics|volume=78|pages=171-173|via=www.springer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated that a gene can be defined as a unit of function. A gene can be subdivided into a linear array of sites that are mutable and that can be recombined. The smallest units of mutation and recombination are now known to be correlated with single nucleotide pairs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6614">In [[representation theory]], the '''[[Category (mathematics)|category]] of representations''' of some algebraic structure {{var|A}} has the representations of {{var|A}} as objects and [[Representation theory#Equivariant maps and isomorphisms|equivariant maps]] as [[morphism]]s between them. One of the basic thrusts of representation theory is to understand the conditions under which this category is [[semisimple category|semisimple]]; i.e., whether an object decomposes into [[simple object]]s (see [[Maschke's theorem]] for the case of finite groups).

The [[Tannakian formalism]] gives conditions under which a group ''G'' may be recovered from the category of representations of it together with the forgetful functor to the [[category of vector spaces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Jacob|first=Lurie,|date=2004-12-14|title=Tannaka Duality for Geometric Stacks|arxiv=math/0412266|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grothendieck ring]] of the category of finite-dimensional representations of a group ''G'' is called the [[representation ring]] of ''G''.

== Definitions ==
Depending on the types of the representations one wants to consider, it is typical to use slightly different definitions.

For a finite group {{var|G}} and a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] {{var|F}}, the '''category of representations of {{var|G}} over {{var|F}}''' has 
* objects: [[Tuple|pairs]] ({{var|V}},{{var|f}}) of [[vector space]]s {{var|V}} over {{var|F}} and representations {{var|f}} of {{var|G}} on that vector space
* morphisms: equivariant maps
* composition: the [[Function composition|composition]] of equivariant maps
* identities: the [[identity function]] (which is indeed an equivariant map).

The category is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Rep}_F(G)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Rep}(G)&lt;/math&gt;.

For a Lie group, one typically requires the representations to be [[smooth representation|smooth]] or [[admissible representation|admissible]]. For the case of a Lie algebra, see [[Lie algebra representation]]. See also: [[category O]].

=== The category of modules over the group ring ===
{{See also|Representation theory of finite groups#Representations, modules and the convolution algebra|Isomorphism of categories#Examples}}

There is an [[isomorphism of categories]] between the category of representations of a group {{var|G}} over a field {{var|F}} (described above) and the [[category of modules]] over the [[group ring]] {{var|F}}[{{var|G}}], denoted '''{{var|F}}[{{var|G}}]-Mod'''.

=== Category-theoretic definition ===
{{See also|Equivariant map#Generalization}}

Every group {{var|G}} can be viewed as a category with a single object, where [[morphism]]s in this category are the elements of {{var|G}} and composition is given by the group operation. Given an arbitrary category '''{{var|C}}''', a ''representation'' of {{var|G}} in '''{{var|C}}''' is a [[functor]] from {{var|G}} to '''{{var|C}}'''. Such a functor selects an object of '''{{var|C}}''' and a [[subgroup]] of the [[automorphism group]] of that object. For example, a [[Group action|{{var|G}}-set]] is equivalent to a functor from {{var|G}} to '''Set''', the [[category of sets]], and a linear representation is equivalent to a functor to  '''Vect'''&lt;sub&gt;{{var|F}}&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[category of vector spaces]] over a field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851741862|title=Categories for the Working Mathematician|last=Mac Lane|first=Saunders|date=1978|publisher=Springer New York|year=|isbn=1441931236|edition=Second|location=New York, NY|pages=41|oclc=851741862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this setting, the '''category of linear representations of {{var|G}} over {{var|F}}''' is the functor category {{var|G}} → '''Vect'''&lt;sub&gt;{{var|F}}&lt;/sub&gt;, which has [[natural transformation]]s as its morphisms.

== Properties ==
{{Expand section|date=November 2017}}
The category of linear representations of a group has a [[Monoidal category|monoidal structure]] given by the [[tensor product of representations]], which is an important ingredient in Tannaka-Krein duality (see below).

[[Maschke's theorem]] states that when the [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of {{var|F}} doesn't divide the [[Order (group theory)|order]] of {{var|G}}, the category of representations of {{var|G}} over {{var|F}} is [[Semisimple category|semisimple]].

== Restriction and induction ==
Given a group {{var|G}} with a [[subgroup]] {{var|H}}, there are two fundamental functors between the categories of representations of {{var|G}} and {{var|H}} (over a fixed field): one is a [[forgetful functor]] called the [[Restricted representation|restriction functor]]
:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  \operatorname{Res}_H^G : \operatorname{Rep}(G) &amp;\longrightarrow \operatorname{Rep}(H) \\
  \pi &amp;\longmapsto \pi|_H
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
and the other, the [[induction functor]]
:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;\operatorname{Ind}_H^G : \operatorname{Rep}(H) \to \operatorname{Rep}(G)&lt;/math&gt;.

When {{var|G}} and {{var|H}} are finite groups, they are [[adjoint functor|adjoint]] to each other
:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_G(\operatorname{Ind}_H^G W, U) \cong \operatorname{Hom}_H(W, \operatorname{Res}_H^G U)&lt;/math&gt;,
a theorem called [[Frobenius reciprocity]].

The basic question is whether the decomposition into irreducible representations (simple objects of the category) behaves under restriction or induction. The question may be attacked for instance by the [[Mackey theory]].

== Tannaka-Krein duality ==
{{Main|Tannaka–Krein duality}}

'''Tannaka–Krein duality''' concerns the interaction of a [[compact group|compact]] [[topological group]] and its category of [[linear representation]]s. Tannaka's theorem describes the converse passage from the category of finite dimensional representations of a group {{var|G}} back to the group {{var|G}}, allowing one to recover the group from its category of representations. Krein's theorem in effect completely characterizes all categories that can arise from a group in this fashion. These concepts can be applied to representations of several different structures, see the main article for details.

'''Chakras''' ([[Sanskrit]]: चक्र, [[IAST]]: cakra, [[Pali]]: cakka, lit. ''wheel, circle'') are the various focal points in the [[Subtle Body|subtle body]] used in a variety of ancient meditation practices, collectively denominated as [[Tantra]], or the esoteric or inner traditions of [[Indian religion]], Chinese Taoism, Tibetan Buddhism, as well as Japanese Esoteric Buddhism, and in postmodernity, in [[New Age medicine]], and originally psychologically adopted to the western mind through the assistance of [[Carl Jung]].&lt;ref name=britchakra&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/chakra Chakra: Religion], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p137"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

==Etymology==
{{see also| Yantra | Mandala}}
The very concept of the so-called chakra, etymologically originates directly from the [[Sanskrit]] root चक्र. The "tsschakra" remained in virtual linguistic conformity throughout possible adaptations throughout the relative temporal and linguist adversity of two thousand years. At heart, the chakra denotes a "wheel", a "circle", and a "cycle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallory|first1=J.P|last2=Adams|first2=D.Q.|title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European culture|date=1997|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-884964-98-5|page=640|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes100"/&gt; One of the Hindu scriptures ''[[Rigveda]]'' mentions ''Chakra'' with the meaning of "wheel", with ''ara'' (spokes). According to [[Frits Staal]], ''Chakra'' has Indo-European roots, is "related to Greek ''Kuklos'' (from which comes English ''cycle''), Latin ''circus'', Anglo-Saxon ''hveohl'' and English ''wheel''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frits Staal|authorlink=Frits Staal|title=Discovering the Vedas: Origins, Mantras, Rituals, Insights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcE23SjLX8sC |year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-309986-4|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Vedic period texts use the same word as a [[simile]] in other contexts, such as the "wheel of time" or "wheel of dharma", such as in ''Rigveda'' hymn verse 1.164.11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frits Staal|authorlink=Frits Staal|title=Discovering the Vedas: Origins, Mantras, Rituals, Insights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcE23SjLX8sC |year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-309986-4|pages=333–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१.१६४ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं १.१६४], verse ॥११॥, Rigveda, Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhism]] generally and Theravada specifically, the [[Pali]] noun ''cakka'' connotes "wheel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57054-1|pages=473–474}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the central "Tripitaka", the Buddha variously references the "dhammacakka", or "wheel of dharma", connoting that his dharma, universal in its advocacy, should bear the marks which bear the very characteristic of any temporal dispensation. While further, it should be added that the Buddha himself insinuated freedom from cycles in and of themselves - [[sui generis]] - be they karmic, reincarnative, liberative, cognitive or emotional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edgerton|first1=Franklin|title=Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Grammar and Dictionary|date=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|location=Delhi|isbn=81-208-0999-8|page=221|edition=Repr}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, the term ''Chakra'' also means "wheel" and appears in various context in its ancient literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Helmuth von Glasenapp|title=Jainism: An Indian Religion of Salvation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzEzXDk0v6sC&amp;pg=PA427|year=1925|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1376-2|pages=280–283, 427–428, 476–477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Indian religions, ''Chakra'' in esoteric theories in Jainism such as those by [[Buddhisagarsuri]] means yogic-energy centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Gordon White|title=Tantra in Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hayV4o50eUEC |year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1778-4|pages=426–427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also| Yoga|Nadi (yoga)}}
The term ''Chakra'' appears to first emerge within the Vedas, the most authoritative Hindu text, though not precisely in the sense of psychic energy centers, rather as ''chakravartin'' or the king who "turns the wheel of his empire" in all directions from a center, representing his influence and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Gordon White|title=Tantra in Practice|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hayV4o50eUEC |year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1778-4|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography popular in representing the ''Chakras'', states White, trace back to the five symbols of [[yajna]], the Vedic fire altar: "square, circle, triangle, half moon and dumpling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Gordon White|title=Tantra in Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hayV4o50eUEC |year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1778-4|page=555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hymn 10.136 of the ''Rigveda'' mentions a renunciate [[yogi]] with a female named ''kunamnama''. Literally, it means "she who is bent, coiled", representing both a minor goddess and one of many embedded enigmas and esoteric riddles within the ''Rigveda''. Some scholars, such as David Gordon White and Georg Feuerstein interpret this might be related to [[kundalini]] shakti, and an overt overature to the terms of esotericism that would later emerge in Post-Aryan Bramhanism. the Upanishad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Gordon White|title=Kiss of the Yogini: "Tantric Sex" in its South Asian Contexts|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5RwARVMg2_4C |year=2006| publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-02783-8|pages=33, 130, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Georg Feuerstein 1998 15–17"&gt;{{cite book|author=Georg Feuerstein |title=Tantra: Path of Ecstasy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4O6_AwAAQBAJ |year=1998|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-0-8348-2545-1|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gavin D.

Chakra is a part of the esoteric medieval era theories about physiology and psychic centers that emerged across Indian traditions.&lt;ref name="YIP14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Basant Pradhan|title=Yoga and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy: A Clinical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=maUxBQAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-09105-1|pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory posited that human life simultaneously exists in two parallel dimensions, one "physical body" (''sthula sarira'') and other "psychological, emotional, mind, non-physical" it is called the "subtle body" (''suksma sarira'').&lt;ref name="Sharma2006p193"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=A Primal Perspective on the Philosophy of Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PiO8lKUs9-YC |year=2006|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-5014-5|pages=193–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The roots to this theory are found in [[Samkhya]] and [[Vedanta]] which attempt to conceptualize the permanent soul and impermanent body as interacting in three overlapping states: the gross body (sthula sarira), the subtle body (suksma sarira), and causal body (karana sarira). These ideas emerged to address questions relating to the nature of body and soul, how and why they interact while one is awake, one is asleep and over the conception-birth-growth-decay-death-rebirth cycle.&lt;ref name="Sharma2006p193"/&gt;&lt;ref name=muller227&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Max Müller|title=The Six Systems of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AOzHazE_nQcC |year=1899|publisher=Longmans |pages=227–236, 393–395}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} This subtle body is energy, while the physical body is mass. The psyche or mind plane corresponds to and interacts with the body plane, and the theory posits that the body and the mind mutually affect each other.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p137"/&gt; The subtle body consists of nadi (energy channels) connected by nodes of psychic energy it called ''chakra''.&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt; The theory grew into extensive elaboration, with some suggesting 88,000 chakras throughout the subtle body.

The chakra theories of Buddhism and Hinduism differs from the historic Chinese system of meridians in acupuncture.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p102"/&gt; Unlike the latter, the ''chakra'' relates to subtle body, wherein it has a position but no definite nervous node or precise physical connection. The tantric systems envision it as a continually present, highly relevant and a means to psychic and emotional energy. It is useful in a type of yogic rituals and meditative discovery of radiant inner energy (''prana'' flows) and mind-body connections.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices, 2nd Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC |year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=190–191, 353–357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meditation is aided by extensive symbology, mantras, diagrams, models (deity and mandala). The practitioner proceeds step by step from perceptible models, to increasingly abstract models where deity and external mandala are abandoned, inner self and internal mandalas are awakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=E.A.

{{quote|Ideas and practices involving so-called 'subtle bodies' have existed for many centuries in many parts of the world. (...) Virtually all human cultures known to us have some kind of concept of mind, spirit or soul as distinct from the physical body, if only to explain experiences such as sleep and dreaming. (...) An important subset of subtle-body practices, found particularly in Indian and Tibetan Tantric traditions, and in similar Chinese practices, involves the idea of an internal 'subtle physiology' of the body (or rather of the body-mind complex) made up of channels through which substances of some kind flow, and points of intersection at which these channels come together. In the Indian tradition the channels are known as ''nadi'' and the points of intersection as ''cakra''.|Geoffrey Samuel and Jay Johnston, ''Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Samuel|author2=Jay Johnston|title=Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_qOz641rV0C|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76640-4|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Contrast with classical yoga===
Chakra and related theories have been important to the esoteric traditions, but they are not directly related to mainstream [[yoga]]. According to Edwin Bryant and other scholars, the goals of classical yoga such as spiritual liberation (freedom, self-knowledge, moksha) is "attained entirely differently in classical yoga, and the ''cakra / nadi / kundalini'' physiology is completely peripheral to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edwin Francis Bryant|title=The Yoga sūtras of Patañjali: a new edition, translation, and commentary with insights from the traditional commentators |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHYxAQAAIAAJ |year=2009|publisher=North Point Press|isbn=978-0-86547-736-0|pages=358–364, 229–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefanie Syman|title=The Subtle Body: The Story of Yoga in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFYFEmSVtQAC|year=2010|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-1-4299-3307-0|pages=72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical traditions==
[[File:Lotus flower (978659).jpg|thumb| Chakras (as well as [[Yantras]] and [[Mandalas]]) are visualised as lotus with different number of petals representing each chakra.]]
The classical eastern traditions, particularly those that developed in India during the 1st millennium AD, primarily describe ''nadi'' and ''cakra'' in a "subtle body" context.&lt;ref name=samuel5/&gt; To them, they are the parallel dimension of psyche-mind reality that is invisible yet real.

Some of it, states this subtle body theory, is what withdraws within when one sleeps.

===Hindu Tantra===
{{Main article|Kundalini energy}}
Different esoteric traditions in Hinduism mention numerous numbers and arrangements chakras, of which a classical system of seven is most prevalent.&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p137"/&gt; This seven-part system, central to the core texts of hatha yoga, is one among many systems found in Hindu tantric literature. These texts teach many different Chakra theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=David Gordon|title=Kiss of the Yogini|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-89483-5|pages=221–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chakra methodology is extensively developed in the goddess tradition of Hinduism called [[Shaktism]]. It is an important concept along with yantras, mandalas and kundalini yoga in its practice. Chakra in Shakta tantrism means circle, an "energy center" within, as well as being a term of group rituals such as in ''chakra-puja'' (worship within a circle) which may or may not involve tantra practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=June McDaniel|title=Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls: Popular Goddess Worship in West Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caeJpIj9SdkC |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-534713-5|pages=96–97, 101–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cakra-based system is one part of the meditative exercises that came to be known as [[laya yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philipp H. Pott|title=Yoga and Yantra: Their Interrelation and Their Significance for Indian Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qNPoCAAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-017-5868-0|pages=8–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond its original [[Shakta]] milieu, various sub-traditions within the [[Shaiva]] and [[Vaishnava]] schools of Hinduism also developed texts and practices on Nadi and Chakra systems. Certain modern Hindu groups also utilize a technique of circular energy work based on the chakras known as ''kriya yoga''. Followers of this practice include the [[Bihar School of Yoga]] and [[Self Realization Fellowship]], and practitioners are known as ''kriyaban''. Although [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] claimed this was the same technique taught as kriya yoga by [[Patañjali]] in the [[Yoga Sūtras]] and by [[Krishna]] in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] (as karma yoga), [[Swami Satyananda]] of the Bihar school disagreed with this assessment and acknowledged the similarities between kriya and taoist inner orbit practices. Both schools claim the technique is taught in every age by an [[avatar]] of god known as [[Mahavatar Babaji|Babaji]]. The historicity of its techniques in India prior to the early twentieth century are not well established. It believed by its practitioners to activate the chakras and stimulate faster spiritual development.

===Buddhist Tantra===
{{Main article|Vajrayana}}
[[Image:Chakras and energy channels 2 (3749594497).jpg|thumb|200px|A Tibetan illustration of the subtle body showing the central channel and two side channels as well as five chakras.]]
The esoteric traditions in Buddhism generally teach five chakras.&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt; It must be noted, that is possible that a system of Manipura, Anahata, Visuddha and the Usnisa Kamala chakras was absorbed into Tibetan thought, yet any source which alleges the employment of 3rd or manipura, chakra, within the context of thousand year history of broad Tantric monasticism, is here, not only conceptually inadequate, but technically misguided.&lt;ref name="Olson2009p78"/&gt; In one development within the Nyingma lineage of the ''Mantrayana'' of Tibetan Buddhism a popular conceptualization of chakras in increasing subtlety and increasing order is as follows: Nirmanakaya (gross self), Sambhogakaya (subtle self), Dharmakaya (causal self), and Mahasukhakaya (non-dual self), each vaguely - yet by no means directly - corresponding to the categories within the [[Shaiva]] ''Mantramarga'' universe, i.e., Svadhisthana, Anahata, Visuddha, Sahasrara, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Samuel|author2=Jay Johnston|title=Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_qOz641rV0C |year=2013 |publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76640-4|page=40, Table 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, depending on the meditational tradition, these vary between three and six.&lt;ref name="Olson2009p78"/&gt;

Chakras clearly play a key role in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], and are considered to be the pivotal providence of Tantric thinking. And, the precise use of the chakras across the gamete of tantric sadhanas gives little space to doubt the primary efficacy of Tibetan Buddhism as distinct religious agency, that being that precise revelation that, without Tantra there would be no Chakras, but more importantly, without Chakras, there is no Tibetan Buddhism. The highest practices in Tibetan Buddhism point to the ability to bring the subtle pranas of an entity into alignment with the central channel, and to thus penetrate the realisation of the ultimate unity, namely, the "organic harmony" of one's individual consciousness of Wisdom with the co-attainment of All-embracing Love, thus synthesizing a direct cognition of absolute [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Geshe Gelsang Kyatos]], ''Clear Light of Bliss''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Geoffrey Samuel, the buddhist esoteric systems developed cakra and nadi as "central to their [[soteriology|soteriological]] process".&lt;ref name=samuel38/&gt; The theories were sometimes, but not always, coupled with a unique system of physical exercises, called ''yantra yoga'' or '''phrul 'khor''. 

The Chakras in the Tibetan practice are considered psycho-spiritual constituents, each bearing meaningful correspondences to cosmic processes and their postulated buddha counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rory Mackenzie|title=New Buddhist Movements in Thailand: Towards an Understanding of Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Santi Asoke |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Or99AgAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-13262-1|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olson2009p78"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Olson|title=Historical Dictionary of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwTnQcFjCQsC&amp;pg=PA78 |year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6317-0|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chakras, according to the [[Bon]] tradition, ennable the gestalt of experience, with each of the five major chakras, being psychologically linked with the five experiential qualities of unenlightened consciousness, the [[six realms]] of woe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahlby|first1=Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche ; edited by Mark|title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light: the five elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen|date=2002|publisher=Snow Lion Pub.|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=1-55939-176-6|page=84}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)#Tsa Lung|tsa lung]] practice embodied in the [[Trul khor]] lineage, unbaffles the primary channels, thus activating and circulating liberating prana. [[Yoga]] awakens the deep mind, thus bringing forth positive attributes, inherent gestalts, and virtuous qualities. In a computer analogy, the screen of one's consciousness is slated and a attribute-bearing file is called up that contains necessary positive or negative, supportive qualities.&lt;ref name=twr&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rinpoche|first1=Tenzin Wangyal|title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light: the five elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen|date=2002|publisher=Snow Lion Pub.|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=1-55939-176-6|pages=84–85}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahlby|first1=Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche ; edited by Mark|title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light: the five elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen|date=2002|publisher=Snow Lion Pub.|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=1-55939-176-6|pages=84–85}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Tantric practice is said to eventually transform all experience into clear light. The practice aims to liberate from all negative conditioning, and the deep cognitive salvation of freedom from control and unity of perception and cognition.&lt;ref name=twr/&gt;

===Qigong===
[[Qigong]] ({{linktext|氣功}}) also relies on a similar model of the human body as an [[Energy (esotericism)|esoteric energy system]], except that it involves the circulation of [[qì]] ({{linktext|氣}}, also ''ki'') or life-energy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Luk]],  ''Taoist Yoga&amp;nbsp;– Alchemy and Immortality'', Rider and Company, London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mantak Chia|Mantak and Maneewan Chia]] ''Awaken Healing Light of the Tao'' (Healing Tao Books, 1993), ch.5&lt;/ref&gt; The qì, equivalent to the Hindu prana, flows through the energy channels called [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]], equivalent to the nadi, but two other energies are also important: ''[[Jing (Chinese medicine)|jīng]]'', or primordial essence, and ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shén]]'', or spirit energy.

In the principle circuit of qì, called the [[microcosmic orbit]], energy rises up a main meridian along the spine, but also comes back down the front torso. Throughout its cycle it enters various [[dantian]] (elixir fields) which act as furnaces, where the types of energy in the body (jing, qi and shen) are progressively refined.&lt;ref&gt;Yang Erzeng, Philip Clart. The Story of Han Xiangzi: the alchemical adventures of a Taoist immortal&lt;/ref&gt; These dantian play a very similar role to that of chakras. The number of dantian varies depending on the system; the navel dantian is the most well-known, but there is usually a dantian located at the heart and between the eyebrows.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mantak Chia|Mantak and Maneewan Chia]] ''Awaken Healing Light of the Tao'' (Healing Tao Books, 1993), ch.13&lt;/ref&gt; The lower dantian at or below the navel transforms essence, or jīng, into qì. The middle dantian in the middle of the chest transforms qì into shén, or spirit, and the higher dantian at the level of the forehead (or at the top of the head), transforms shen into [[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]], infinite space of void.&lt;ref&gt;Andy James. The Spiritual Legacy of Shaolin Temple&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silat===
Traditional spirituality in the Malay Archipelago borrows heavily from Hindu-Buddhist concepts. In Malay and Indonesian metaphysical theory, the chakras' energy rotates outwards along diagonal lines. Defensive energy emits outwards from the centre line, while offensive energy moves inwards from the sides of the body. This can be applied to energy-healing, meditation, or martial arts. [[Silat]] practitioners learn to harmonise their movements with the chakras, thereby increasing the power and effectiveness of attacks and movements.&lt;ref name="Tua"&gt;{{cite book| title=Silat Tua: The Malay Dance Of Life |author=Zainal Abidin Shaikh Awab and Nigel Sutton |year=2006 |publisher=Azlan Ghanie Sdn Bhd |location=Kuala Lumpur |isbn=978-983-42328-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more common and most studied esoteric system incorporates six major chakras along with a seventh center generally not regarded as a chakra. These points are arranged vertically along the axial channel ([[Nadi (yoga)|sushumna nadi]] in Hindu texts, Avadhuti in some Buddhist texts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Samuel|author2=Jay Johnston|title=Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_qOz641rV0C |year=2013 |publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76640-4|pages=39–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this chakra system that was translated in early 20th century by [[Sir John Woodroffe]] (also called Arthur Avalon) in the text ''The Serpent Power''.

The Chakras are traditionally considered meditation aids. The yogi progresses from lower chakras to the highest chakra blossoming in the crown of the head, internalizing the journey of spiritual ascent.&lt;ref name="Banerjea175"&gt;{{cite book|author=Akshaya Kumar Banerjea|title=Philosophy of Gorakhnath with Goraksha-Vacana-Sangraha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ljn1koKa0CQC&amp;pg=PA175|year=1983|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0534-7|pages=175–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both the Hindu and Buddhist kundalini or candali traditions, the chakras are pierced by a dormant energy residing near or in the lowest chakra. In Hindu texts she is known as [[Kundalini]], while in Buddhist texts she is called Candali or [[Tummo]] (Tibetan: ''gtum mo'', "fierce one").&lt;ref name=johnston40/&gt;

Below are the common new age description of these six chakras and the seventh point known as sahasrara. This new age version incorporates the newtonian colors that were completely unknown when these systems were created. The actual colors for the chakras vary from text to text and do not conform to the newtonian spectrum:

|width=170 valign=top|[[File:Sahasrara Mandala.svg|center|170px]]
|valign=top|'''[[Sahasrara]]''' ({{lang-sa|सहस्रार}}, [[IAST]]: {{IAST|Sahasrāra}}, {{lang-en|"thousand-petaled"}}) or '''crown chakra''' is the topmost chakra in the subtle body, located in the crown of the head. In esoteric Hinduism and New Age western systems, it is generally considered to be the highest spiritual center and the state of pure consciousness, within which there is neither object nor subject. When the feminine [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] Shakti rises to this point, it unites with the masculine [[Shiva]], the yogi or yogini achieves self-realization and a state of liberating [[samadhi]] is attained. The chakra is symbolized by a lotus with one thousand multi-coloured petals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Grimes|title=A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcoUFYOX0bEC |year=1996|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3067-5|pages=265, 100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In esoteric Buddhism, it is called '''Mahasukha''' and is generally considered to be the petal lotus of "Great Bliss" and corresponding to the fourth state of [[Four Noble Truths]].&lt;ref name=johnston40&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Samuel|author2=Jay Johnston|title=Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_qOz641rV0C |year=2013 |publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76640-4|pages=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|valign=top|'''[[Ajna]]''' ({{lang-sa|आज्ञा}}, [[IAST]]: {{IAST|Ājñā}}, {{lang-en|"command"}}) also called '''guru chakra or third-eye chakra''' is the subtle center of energy, believed to be located between the eyebrows, located behind it along the subtle (non-physical) spinal column. It is so called because this is the spot where the tantra [[guru]] touches the seeker during the initiation ritual (''saktipata''). He or she commands the awakened kundalini to pass through this center.&lt;ref name=grimes22&gt;{{cite book|author=John A.

It is symbolised by a lotus with two petals.&lt;ref name=grimes22/&gt; It is at this point that the two side nadi [[Ida (yoga)]] and Pingala are said to terminate and merge with the central channel Sushumna, signifying the end of duality, the characteristic of being dual (e.g. ''light'' and ''dark'', or ''male'' and ''female'').

It is symbolised by a lotus with twelve petals.&lt;ref name=grimes30/&gt; Within it is a yantra of two intersecting triangles, forming a [[hexagram]], symbolising a union of the male and female as well as being the esoteric symbol for the element of air ([[vayu]]). The seed mantra of air, ''Yam'', is at its center. The presiding deity is Ishana Rudra Shiva, and the Shakti is Kakini.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In esoteric Buddhism, this Chakra is called '''Dharma''' and is generally considered to be the petal lotus of "Essential nature" and corresponding to the second state of [[Four Noble Truths]].&lt;ref name=johnston40/&gt;

This chakra is represented as an upward pointing triangle representing fire in the middle of a lotus with ten petals. The seed syllable for fire is at its center Ram. The presiding deity is Braddha Rudra, with Lakini as the Shakti.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

It is symbolised as a six-petaled lotus.&lt;ref name="grimes100"/&gt; Svadhisthana is represented with a lotus within which is a crescent moon symbolizing the water element. The seed mantra in its center is ''Vam'' representing water. The presiding deity is Brahma, with the Shakti being Rakini (or Chakini).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Dormant [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] is often said to be resting here, wrapped three and a half, or seven or twelve times. Sometimes she is wrapped around the black Svayambhu linga, the lowest of three obstructions to her full rising (also known as knots or granthis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=C.

==Reception and similar theories in the West==

{{cite check|section|date=August 2015}}
In 1918, the translation of two Indian texts: the ''Ṣaṭ-Cakra-Nirūpaṇa'' and the ''Pādukā-Pañcaka'', by Sir [[John Woodroffe]], alias Arthur Avalon, in a book titled ''The Serpent Power'' introduced the [[shakta]] theory of seven main chakras in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Woodroffe, ''The Serpent Power'', Dover Publications, pp.317ff&lt;/ref&gt; This book is extremely detailed and complex, and later the ideas were developed into the predominant Western view of the chakras by [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]] in his book ''The Chakras''. Many of the views which directed Leadbeater's understanding of the chakras were influenced by previous theosophist authors, in particular [[Johann Georg Gichtel]], a disciple of [[Jakob Böhme]], and his book ''Theosophia Practica (1696)'', in which Gichtel directly refers to inner ''force centres'', a concept reminiscent of the chakras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archeosofica.org/en/index.php/Theosophical-Excerpts/Gichtel-and-the-Theosophia-Practica.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304194144/http://www.archeosofica.org/en/index.php/Theosophical-Excerpts/Gichtel-and-the-Theosophia-Practica.html|date=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hesychasm===

A completely separate contemplative movement within the Eastern Orthodox Church is [[Hesychasm]], a form of Christian meditation. Comparisons have been made between the Hesychastic centres of prayer and the position of the chakras.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade. Yoga, Immortality and Freedom&lt;/ref&gt; Particular emphasis is placed upon the heart area. However, there is no talk about these centres as having any sort of metaphysical existence. Far more than in any of the cases discussed above, the centres are simply places to focus the concentration during prayer.

===New Age===
{{Main article|New Age}}
[[File:Nervous plexi.jpg|thumb|Chakra positions in relation to nervous plexi, from a 1927 textbook]]
In ''[[Anatomy of the Spirit]]'' (1996), [[Caroline Myss]] describes the function of chakras as follows: "Every thought and experience you've ever had in your life gets filtered through these chakra databases. Each event is recorded into your cells...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myss.com/library/chakras/ |title=Myss Library &amp;#124; Chakras |publisher=Myss.com |date= |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chakras are described as being aligned in an ascending column from the base of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]] to the top of the head. [[New Age]] practices often associate each chakra with a certain colour. In various traditions, chakras are associated with multiple physiological functions, an aspect of [[consciousness]], a [[classical element]], and other distinguishing characteristics. They are visualised as lotuses or flowers with a different number of petals in every chakra.

The chakras are thought to vitalise the physical body and to be associated with interactions of a physical, emotional and mental nature. They are considered [[Wiktionary:locus|loci]] of life [[Energy (spirituality)|energy]] or [[prana]] (which New Age belief equates with ''[[shakti]]'', ''[[qi]]'' in Chinese, ''ki ''in Japanese, ''koach-ha-guf''&lt;ref&gt;Helena Blavatsky (1892). Theosophical Glossary. Krotona.&lt;/ref&gt; in Hebrew, ''bios ''in Greek, and [[aether (classical element)|''aether'']]'' ''in both Greek and English), which is thought to flow among them along pathways called [[Nadi (yoga)|nadi]]. The function of the chakras is to spin and draw in this energy to keep the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical health of the body in balance.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Rudolf Steiner]] considered the chakra system to be dynamic and evolving. He suggested that this system has become different for modern people than it was in ancient times and that it will, in turn, be radically different in future times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/MAC1909/GA010b_c01.html |title=GA010: Chapter I: The Astral Centers |location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Wn.rsarchive.org |date= |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/MAC1909/GA010b_index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/MAC1909/GA010b_index.html |title=GA010: Initiation and Its Results|location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Wn.rsarchive.org |date= |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner described a sequence of development that begins with the upper chakras and moves down, rather than moving in the opposite direction. He gave suggestions on how to develop the chakras through disciplining thoughts, feelings, and will.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''How to Know Higher Worlds''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Florin Lowndes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowndes|first1=Florin|title=Enlivening the Chakra of the Heart: The Fundamental Spiritual Exercises of Rudolf Steiner|date=2000|publisher=Sophia Books|location=London|isbn=1-85584-053-7|edition=2nd}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a "spiritual student" can further develop and deepen or elevate thinking consciousness when taking the step from the "ancient path" of schooling to the "new path" represented by Steiner's ''[[The Philosophy of Freedom]]''.{{refn|group=note|English translations include:

===Endocrine system===

Chakras and their importance are posited to reside in the psyche.

'''Decolonizing Architecture Art Residency''' (DAAR) is an architectural studio and a residency program based in [[Beit Sahour]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. DAAR’s work combines spatial interventions, theoretical writings and collective learning. DAAR is dedicated to architectural experimentations on the reuse and transformation of [[colonial architecture]], settlements, [[Military base|military bases]], 1948 cleansed Palestinian villages, primarily in Palestine. DAAR was founded in 2007 in Beit Sahour near [[Bethlehem]] by Alessandro Petti, Sandi Hilal and [[Eyal Weizman]]. The ideas that have been developed and disseminated throughout the region and abroad via exhibitions, seminars, videos and publications.&lt;ref name="sternberg-press.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sternberg Press - Sandi Hilal, Alessandro Petti, Eyal Weizman|url = http://www.sternberg-press.com/?pageId=1480|website = www.sternberg-press.com|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times - Culture Monster (25 January 2011) [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/01/top-redcat-director-leaving-for-post-at-walker-art-center.html ''Top REDCAT curator leaving for post at Walker Art Center in Minneapolis'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCP2010DAi"&gt;Prins Claus Fonds (2010) [http://www.princeclausfund.org/nl/network/user/id/149 profile]&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of local and international architects are allied with the institute. Furthermore, it works together with a large number of artists, film makers and activists.&lt;ref&gt;Decolonizing Architecture institute, [http://www.decolonizing.ps/site/participants/ participants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028045437/http://www.decolonizing.ps/site/participants/ |date=2012-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ozler, Levent (22 November 2010) [http://www.dexigner.com/news/21953 ''Decolonizing Architecture'']&lt;/ref&gt; The architectural studio and art residency was established with the aim of engaging with a complex set of architectural problems centered on one
of the most difficult dilemmas of political practice: how to act both propositionally and critically in an environment in which the political force fields, as complex as they may be, are so dramatically skewed. Are interventions at all possible? How can we find an “autonomy of practice” that is both critical and transformative?

== Prizes ==
In 2010 the institute was honored with a Prince Claus Award, a major cultural development award from the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Prince Claus Fund - Network|url = http://www.princeclausfund.org/en/network/decolonizing.html|website = www.princeclausfund.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury rewards its work "for introducing a non-traditional approach to development in conflict and post-conflict situations, for providing valuable speculation on the future realities of disputed territories, for its critical challenge to outdated urban planning theories based on a more peaceful world, and for highlighting the role of architecture highlighting the role of architecture and visualisation in creating and altering the frontiers of reality."&lt;ref name="PCP2010DAi" /&gt; DAAR was nominated for the Curry Stone Design Price, the Anni and Heinrich Sussmann Artist Award, the New School’s Vera List Center Prize for Art and Politics, the Chrnikov Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Iakov Chernikhovs Architecture Prize 2010 Top Ten Finalists|url = http://www.archdaily.com/92027/iakov-chernikhovs-architecture-prize-2010-top-ten-finalists|website = ArchDaily|accessdate = 2015-11-29|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
DAAR projects have been published and exhibited in various venues including the Venice Biennale, Home Works in Beirut, the Istanbul Biennial, he Bozar in Brussels, NGBK in Berlin, Sharjah Biennale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sharjah Art Foundation - Decolonizing Architecture Art Residency (DAAR)|url = http://www.sharjahart.org/people/people-by-alphabet/d/daar|website = www.sharjahart.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Architecture Biennale Rveniotterdam, Architekturforum Tirol in Innsbruk, the Tate in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Architecture after Revolution {{!}} Tate|url = http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/talks-and-lectures/architecture-after-revolution|website = www.tate.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Oslo Triennial, the Pompidou Centre in Paris.

== Teaching ==
DAAR’s members have taught lectured and published internationally including a term as guest professors at the Berlage Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Return to the Common / 2011–2012 / The Berlage|url = http://www.theberlage.nl/events/details/2012_04_25_return_to_the_common|website = www.theberlage.nl|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bir Zeit University, Bard-Al Quds, Goldsmiths, and other places.

== Book ==
in 2013 DAAR published 'Architecture after Revolution' with the Berlin-based publisher Strenberg Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Critical Proximity|url = http://www.domusweb.it/en/reviews/2014/03/07/critical_proximity.html|website = domusweb.it|accessdate = 2015-11-29|language = it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work presented in this book is an invitation to undertake an urgent architectural and political thought experiment: to rethink today’s struggles for justice and equality not only from the historical perspective of revolution, but also from that of a continued struggle for decolonization; consequently, to rethink the problem of political subjectivity not from the point of view of a Western conception of a liberal citizen but rather from that of the displaced and extraterritorial refugee. You will not find here descriptions of popular uprising, armed resistance, or political negotiations, despite these of course forming an integral and necessary part of any radical political transformation. Instead, the authors present a series of provocative projects that try to imagine “the morning after revolution.”&lt;ref name="sternberg-press.com"/&gt;

'''Decommunization''' is a process of dismantling the legacies of the [[communist state]] establishments, culture, and psychology in the post-communist states. It is sometimes referred to as political cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer A. Yoder (1999) "From East Germans to Germans?: The New Postcommunist Elites", {{ISBN|0-8223-2372-9}},, pp. 95-97&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most commonly applied to the former countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]] and the [[post-Soviet states]] to describe a number of legal and social changes during their periods of [[postcommunism]].

In some states decommunization included [[bans on Communist symbols]]. While sharing common traits the processes of decommunization have run differently in different states.&lt;ref name="Lithuanian ban on Soviet symbols"&gt;{{citation|title = Lithuanian ban on Soviet symbols|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7459976.stm|publisher = BBC News|date = 17 Jun 2008|accessdate = 3 Jun 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodbye, Lenin: Ukraine moves to ban communist symbols"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32267075 |first= Vitaly |last= Shevchenko |title= Goodbye, Lenin: Ukraine moves to ban communist symbols |work= [[BBC News]] |date=14 April 2015 |accessdate= 3 Jun 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decommunization organizations==

===Investigators and prosecutors===
* Cambodia - The [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]]
* Czech Republic - The [[Office of the Documentation and the Investigation of the Crimes of Communism]]
* Slovakia - The [[Institute of National Memory]] - Ústav pamäti národa (Sk)
* Estonia - The [[Estonian International Commission for Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity]]
* Germany - The [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]] (BStU)
* Indonesia - The [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order Government]]
* Hungary - The [[Institute for the History of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution]]
* Lithuania - The [[Lithuanian Center for the Research of Genocide and Resistance]]
* Poland - The [[Institute of National Remembrance|Institute of National Remembrance — Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation]]
* Romania - The [[Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes in Romania]]
* Moldova - The [[Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Moldova]]
* Ukraine - The [[Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance]]

==Prosecution of former communists==
{{Main article|Lustration}}
[[Lustration]] came to refer to government policies of limiting the participation of former communists, and especially informants of the communist [[secret police]], in the successor political appointee positions or even in [[civil service]] positions.

===Prosecution of Communist state leaders===
* Afghanistan - [[Mohammad Najibullah]] was sentenced to death and hanged.
* Bulgaria - [[Todor Zhivkov]] was sentenced to 7 years in prison, but served only one day because he was freed for "health reasons".
* Cambodia - [[Kang Kek Iew]] is so far the only indicted [[Khmer Rouge]] leader, while [[Pol Pot]] and others lived free without charges.
* East Germany - [[Eric Honecker]] was arrested, but soon released due to ill health. Several people, such as [[Egon Krenz]], were convicted.
* Ethiopia - [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] sentenced to death in absentia
* Poland - [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] avoided most court appearances citing poor health. He died in 2014.
* Romania - [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] was sentenced to death and executed.

==Results==
Communist parties outside the Baltic states were not outlawed and their members were not prosecuted. Just a few places attempted to exclude even members of communist secret services from decision-making. In a number of countries, the communist party simply changed its name and continued to function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icer.it/docs/wp2000/Pejovich162000.pdf After socialism: where hope for individual liberty lies]. Svetozar Pejovich.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Holmes (academic)|Stephen Holmes]] of the [[University of Chicago]] argued in 1996 that after a period of active decommunization, it was met with a near-universal failure. After the introduction of lustration, demand for scapegoats has become relatively low, and former communists have been elected for high governmental and other administrative positions. Holmes notes that the only real exception was former [[East Germany]], where thousands of former [[Stasi]] informers have been fired from public positions.&lt;ref name=mandelbaum&gt;Michael Mandelbaum (Ed., 1996) "Post-Communism: Four Perspectives", ''Council on Foreign Relations''{{ISBN|0876091869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes suggests the following reasons for the turnoff of decommunization:&lt;ref name=mandelbaum/&gt;
*After 45–70 years of [[state communism]], nearly every family has members associated with the state. After the initial desire "to root out the reds" came a realization that massive punishment is wrong and finding only some guilty is hardly justice.
*The urgency of the current economic problems of postcommunism makes the crimes of the communist past "old news" for many citizens.
*Decommunization is believed to be a power game of elites.
*The difficulty of dislodging the social elite makes it require a [[totalitarian state]] to disenfranchise the "[[enemies of the people]]" quickly and efficiently and a desire for normalcy overcomes the desire for punitive justice.
*Very few people have a perfectly clean slate and so are available to fill the positions that require significant expertise. People begin remembering that [[Lenin]]'s idea (though misattributed from ''Vladimir Ilyich Lenin'', a poem critical of Lenin, by Vladimir Mayakovsky) that "every cookwoman may govern the state", failed.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Deaths attributed to decommunization==
[[Matthew White (atrocitologist)|Matthew White]] found an ''[[LA Times]]'' article from 1998 and a ''Times of London'' article from 2000, which both reported that from 3 to 6 million [[Russians]] and natives of other former [[Communist states]] died or were not born due to decreased living conditions after the [[fall of communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hough|first1=Jerry|url=http://necrometrics.com/all20c.htm|agency=LA Times|date=18 August 1998|accessdate=March 5, 2018|title=Deaths attributed to decommunization (1991-2000)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Direct instruction''' ('''DI''') is a general term for the explicit teaching of a skill-set using [[lecture]]s or demonstrations of the material to students. A particular subset of '''direct instruction''', denoted by capitalization as '''Direct Instruction''', refers to a specific example of the approach developed by [[Siegfried Engelmann]] and Wesley C. Becker. DI teaches by explicit instruction,&lt;ref name=LearnLab&gt;[http://www.learnlab.org/research/wiki/index.php/Explicit_instruction] Explicit Instruction. LearnLab. Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center. Retrieved 2017-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to exploratory models such as [[inquiry-based learning]]. DI includes [[tutorial]]s, participatory laboratory classes, [[discussion]], [[recitation]], [[seminar]]s, [[workshop]]s, [[observation]], [[active learning]], [[practicum|practica]], or [[internship]]s.

DI relies on a systematic curriculum design, delivered by implementation of a prescribed [[behavioral script]]. On the premise that all students can learn and all teachers successfully teach if given effective training in specific techniques, teachers may be evaluated based on measurable student learning.

In some special education programs, direct instruction is used in [[resource rooms]], when teachers assist with [[homework]] completion and academic remediation.&lt;ref name=Englert &gt;[http://rse.sagepub.com/content/5/2/38.abstract Effective direct instruction practices in special education settings]. Englert, Carol S. ''Remedial &amp; Special Education'', Vol 5(2), Mar-Apr 1984, 38-47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engelmann's Direct Instruction method and DISTAR ==

The term ''Direct Instruction'' applies specifically to a pedagogical model developed by Siegfried Engelmann in 1964 at the University of Illinois Institute for Research on Exceptional Children.&lt;ref&gt;Engelmann, S. (2007) Teaching Needy Kids in our Backward System.Eugene, OR: ADI Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[DISTAR]] was a specific direct instruction model developed by Siegfried Engelmann and Wesley C. Becker. Engelmann and Becker sought to identify teaching methods that would accelerate the progress of historically disadvantaged elementary school students.&lt;ref&gt;Englemann, S.E.(1968). Relating operant techniques to programming and teaching. ''Journal of School Psychology, 6,'' 89-96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kim &gt;Kim, T. &amp; Axelrod, S. (2005). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26452612_Direct_Instruction_An_Educators'_Guide_and_a_Plea_for_Action Direct Instruction: An Educators’ Guide and a Plea for Action]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 6.(2),'' Page 111-123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DISTAR]], an acronym for '''D'''irect '''I'''nstruction '''S'''ystem for '''T'''eaching '''A'''rithmetic and '''R'''eading, gained prominence during [[Project Follow Through]], the largest educational study ever conducted in America.

Features of DI include:
*Explicit instruction based on lesson plans, often with specific teacher "scripts."
*[[Ability grouping]]. Students are grouped based on their rate of progress through the program.
*Emphasis on pace and efficiency of instruction. Lessons are designed to bring students to mastery as quickly as possible.
*Frequent assessment.
*Embedded professional development/coaching. Program developers recommend careful monitoring and coaching.

Direct Instruction has been effectively delivered through peers to students with [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name=Marchand-Martella &gt;Marchand-Martella, &amp; Martella (2002) [http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/3/2/213.pdf&amp;productCode=pa An Overview and Research Summary of Peer-Delivered Corrective Reading]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 3 (2),'' 214 -235&lt;/ref&gt;
Peer delivery offers teachers new ways to use the curriculum.&lt;ref name=Marchand-Martella /&gt; The approach has also been examined as a model to assist students in a [[resource room]] with homework completion, bolster executive functioning skills and improve teacher efficiency.&lt;ref name=Englert /&gt;

==Success for All==
Another popular direct instruction approach is the [[Success for All]] program, which uses [[scripted teaching]] to instruct elementary children in [[phonics]] intensive reading instruction program. What the teacher says is carefully scripted in the program. The program was designed by [[Johns Hopkins University]] professor [[Robert Slavin]] in the mid 1980s for failing schools in [[Baltimore]]. The program requires a dedicated 90 minutes of reading instruction each day in which the teacher must follow a pre-ordained lesson plan that has every minute filled with scripted instruction and specific activities designed to teach reading. [[Jonathan Kozol|Kozol]] criticized the program in his book, ''[[The Shame of the Nation]]'', for being excessively dogmatic, utilitarian, and authoritarian.&lt;ref name=Kozol &gt;{{cite book |last=Kozol |first=Jonathan |date=2005 |title=The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America |url= |location=New York |publisher=Random House |page= |isbn=1-4000-5244-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Debates about the efficacy of DI have raged since before the final results of [[Project Follow Through]] were published; however, there is substantial empirical research supporting its effectiveness. A meta-analysis published by Adams &amp; Engelmann (1996), a chief architect of the DI program, finds a "mean effect size average per study...(as) more than .75, which confirms that the overall effect is substantial."

In some special education programs, it is used in a [[resource room]] with small groups of students. Some research has shown benefit with this model.&lt;ref&gt;Resource Room Teachers' use of Strategies that Promote the Success of Handicapped Students in Regular Classrooms Nancy K. Glomb and Daniel P. Morgan Journal of Special Education, Jan 1991; vol. 25: pp. 221 - 235&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct Instruction is used with students from every population segment (with regard to poverty, culture, and race). In [[Project Follow Through]], the DI model was ranked first in achievement for poor students, students who were not poor, urban students, rural students, [[African American]] students, [[Hispanic]] students, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] students.  Today, many of the Bureau of Indian Affair's highest-performing schools use Direct Instruction materials. The Baltimore Curriculum Project has many schools with Free and Reduced Lunch Rates above 75% serving student populations that are more than 90% African American. These schools have shown strong achievement gains using Direct Instruction.&lt;ref name=Rebar2007&gt;Rebar, M. (2007).  [http://www.ewu.edu/getset/Academic_Acceleration_G1_TR_2007-1.pdf Academic acceleration in first grade using the Direct Instruction model]. (Report No. 2007-1). Cheney, WA: Eastern Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meta-analysis of 85 [[single-subject design]] studies comparing direct instruction to other teaching strategies found the effects to be substantial for students with learning disabilities;&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, H.L. &amp; Sachse-Lee, C. (2000). A Meta-Analysis of Single-Subject-Design Intervention Research for Students with LD. ''Journal of Learning Disabilities,'' Vol. 33, No. 2, 114-136 {{doi|10.1177/002221940003300201}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, when qualified by IQ and reading levels [[strategy instruction]] (SI) had better effects for the high IQ group. For the low-IQ discrepancy groups, higher effect sizes were yielded for a Combined DI and SI Model when compared to all competing models. With the exception of handwriting, DI's effects were all above .8 (i.e., reading and mathematics).{{Clarify|date=May 2016}}

John Hattie's Visible Learning: A Synthesis of Over 800 Meta-Analyses Relating to Achievement (2009) summarizes the results of four meta-analyses that examined Direct Instruction. These analyses incorporated 304 studies of over 42,000 students. Across all of these students, the average effect size was .59 and was significantly larger than those of any other curriculum Hattie studied.{{Clarify|date=May 2016}}

Direct Instruction is recognized as one of two effective models of comprehensive school reform and, in many cases, can be integrated into a tiered model system{{Definition needed|date=May 2016}} to address students with developing problems.&lt;ref name=Stewart &gt;Stewart, R.M.,  Martella, R.C., Marchand-Martella, N.E. &amp;  Benner, G.J. (2005). [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ846760.pdf Three-Tier Models of Reading and Behavior]. ''JEIBI''  2 (3), 115-123&lt;/ref&gt; The findings from [[Project Follow Through]], conducted in a variety of selected communities throughout the United States, suggested that Direct Instruction is the most effective model for teaching academic skills and for affective outcomes (e.g., [[self-esteem]]) of children. Recent large-scale studies (1997–2003), such as the Baltimore Curriculum Project, show that it is possible to help schools that are in the lowest twenty percent with respect to academic achievement steadily improve until they are performing well above average. In some cases, school achievement improved from the 16th percentile to above the 90th percentile.&lt;ref name=Rebar2007/&gt;

==Criticism==
One three-year study of methods of teaching reading showed that highly scripted, teacher-directed methods of teaching reading were not as effective as traditional methods that allowed a more flexible approach.&lt;ref name=Ryder2006&gt;Ryder RJ, Burton JL, Silberg A. 2006. Longitudinal study of direct instruction effects from first through third grade. Journal of Educational Research, 99, 3, 179-191&lt;/ref&gt; Urban teachers in particular expressed great concern over the DI's lack of sensitivity to issues of [[poverty]], [[culture]], and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]].&lt;ref name=Ryder2006/&gt;

The former president of the [[National Science Teachers Association]] (NSTA), Anne Tweed, questioned whether direct instruction was the most effective science teaching strategy. In the December 15, 2004 NSTA Reports she concluded that "direct instruction alone cannot replace the in-depth experience with science concepts that inquiry-based strategies provide."&lt;ref&gt;Tweed, a. (2004). [http://www.nsta.org/publications/news/story.aspx?id=50045 Direct Instruction: Is It the Most Effective Science Teaching Strategy?] ''NSTA Reports'', 15 December 2004. Retrieved 5 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics also see DI as a betrayal of the [[humanism|humanistic]], [[egalitarian]] foundations of public education, or as a "canned" or "teacher proof" curriculum deliverable via unskilled teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-distance.syr.edu/sdlhuman.html From behaviorism to humanism: Incorporating self-direction in learning concepts into the instructional design process.] In H. B. Long &amp; Associates, New ideas about self-directed learning. Norman, OK: Oklahoma Research Center for Continuing Professional and Higher Education, University of Oklahoma, 1994 (Roger Hiemstra &amp; Ralph Brockett)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, where DI has been used in schools among several remote Indigenous Australians communities in Queensland, DI has been criticised for its high cost in return for at best modest improvements in literacy and numeracy levels, as well as its US-centric theme which is alien to indigenous Australian cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Misty Adoniou.

The purpose of dorkbot meetings is to nurture a local electronic arts community and to encourage emerging, and established, artists to present new works for informal peer review.  While many of the dorkbot groups hold their meetings at universities and students are encouraged to attend, dorkbot meetings are not restricted in any way to the academic community.  Dorkbot groups encourage the free exchange of ideas on the electronic arts, and regular attendees of one dorkbot will often visit another when they are travelling, serving as informal ambassadors between groups.

'''Edmund Duncan Montgomery''' (March 19, 1835 – April 17, 1911) was a [[Scottish-American]] [[philosopher]], [[scientist]] and [[physician]]. He was the husband of [[German-American]] [[sculptor]] [[Elisabet Ney]]

==Early life==

Montgomery was born on the 19th of March, 1835, in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]].  His parentage is unknown, but the [[Elisabet Ney Museum]] relates the possibility that he was the son of Isabella Davidson (or Montgomery) and a prominent Scottish jurist, [[Duncan McNeill, 1st Baron Colonsay]]. He and his mother lived in [[Paris, France|Paris]] and [[Frankfurt, Germany|Frankfurt]], supplemented by a trust fund for him.&lt;ref name="Shady Ladies: Nineteen Surprising and Rebellious American Women"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ney Museum-Edmund Montgomery"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ney Museum-Edmund Montgomery|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/elisabetney/html/montgomery_biography.html|publisher=Elisabet Ney Museum|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time he entered his teens, he began to be interested in the [[philosophical]] works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].  While still living in Frankfurt and only 13 years old, he participated in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]].&lt;ref name="Edmund Montromery"/&gt;

==Education==

In 1852, Montgomery majored in medicine at the [[University of Heidelberg]], where he did lab work under [[Robert Bunsen]] and came under the influence of Christian Kapp, [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach]] and [[Jacob Moleschott]].&lt;ref name="Edmund Montromery"/&gt;  He later attended lectures by [[Johannes Peter Müller]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] during his 1855–1856 enrollment.  While studying in  [[Bonn, Germany|Bonn]]  1856–1857, he attended influential lectures of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]].&lt;ref name="Edmund Montromery"/&gt;

==Medical practice==

Montgomery received his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree from the [[University of Würzburg]] on February 18, 1858.&lt;ref name="Edmund Montromery"/&gt;

Montgomery interned at [[Prague]] and [[Vienna]]. He served his residency at the [[German Hospital, Dalston]] ([[London]]) and Bermondsay Dispensary.  While doing biological research, he became [[Curator]] of the [[St Thomas' Hospital]] and Demonstrator of Morbid Anatomy.&lt;ref name="Edmund Montgomery Pioneer of Organicism"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keeton|first=Morris T|title=Edmund Montgomery Pioneer of Organicism|jstor=2707145|work=Journal of the History of Ideas|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|volume=8|pages=309–341|doi=10.2307/2707145}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[Royal College of Physicians|Royal College of Physicians of London]] in 1862.

After being diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] in 1863, Montgomery left the Royal College of Physicians of London and established medical practices on the resort island of [[Madeira]] (1863–1865), in [[Menton]] (1866) on the [[French Riviera]], and also in [[Rome]] (1867) and [[Munich]] (1868), while continuing to do his research. A [[life annuity]] allowed him to retire from medical practice in 1869, and devote the rest of his life to philosophy, scientific research, and writing.&lt;ref name="Ney Museum-Edmund Montgomery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edmund Montromery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edmund Montgomery and Elisabet Ney papers"/&gt;

==Medicine==

Montgomery's work in medicine included the study of [[cell theory]].

==Philosophy==

Montgomery's study of philosophy complemented his work as a physical scientist. He saw life as the ability of certain chemical compounds to resist damage. He commented on conceptions of knowledge and [[self (philosophy)|self]] in over sixty journal articles and five books. He was an advocate of [[humanitarianism]] and a "religion of life," focusing on the idea that man must not ignore the potential of his own yet-to-be-completed evolutionary process.

The two most significant papers written by Montgomery were his ''Refutation of Kant From the Standpoint of the Empirical'' (1870) and ''The Revelation of Present Experience ''(1910).&lt;ref name="Edmund Montromery"/&gt;

In the former, Montgomery convincingly refutes Immanuel Kant's a priori, the lynchpin of Kant's system, and in the latter, he insists that all knowledge (no exceptions) is based on the evidence provided by the senses.

Montgomery was an advocate of [[non-Darwinian evolution]] and [[organicism]]. He was also cited as a defender of [[vitalism]]. He authored ''The Vitality and Organization of Protoplasm'' (1904) and ''Philosophical Problems in the Light of Vital Organization''.&lt;ref&gt;Driesch, Hans. (1914). [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924003039330#page/n173 ''The History and Theory of Vitalism'']. Macmillan and Co. pp. 163-166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter S. Gamertsfelder|Gamertsfelder, Walter Sylvester]]; Evans, Daniel Luther. (1930). [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3927921;view=1up;seq=407 ''Fundamentals of Philosophy'']. Prentice-Hall. p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described as a pioneer of organicism.&lt;ref&gt;Keeton, Morris T. (1947). ''Edmund Montgomery--Pioneer of Organicism''. ''[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]'' 8 (3): 309-341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, I. K. (1931). ''Edmund Montgomery : The Hermit Philosopher of Liendo Plantation''. ''[[Southwest Review]]'' 16 (2): 200-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

While a student at the University of Heidelberg in 1853, Montgomery began a courtship with sculptor [[Elisabet Ney]], who was visiting friends in the city.  They were married at the [[British consulate]] in Madeira on November 7, 1863.&lt;ref name="Shady Ladies: Nineteen Surprising and Rebellious American Women"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ledbetter|first=Suzann|title=Shady Ladies: Nineteen Surprising and Rebellious American Women|year=2006|publisher=Forge Books|isbn=978-0-7653-0827-6|pages=179–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomery was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] in 1863.  By 1870, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] had begun. In the autumn of that year, Ney became pregnant with their first child.  Montgomery received a letter from his friend, Baron Carl Vicco Otto Friedrich Constantin von Stralendorff of [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], who had moved to [[Thomasville, Georgia]] with his new wife, Margaret Elizabeth Russell of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], declaring the location "Earth's paradise."&lt;ref name="Elisabet Ney Emigration 1871-1873"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elisabet Ney Emigration 1871–1873|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/elisabetney/html/emigration.html|publisher=City of Austin Parks and Recreation Dept|accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 14, 1871, Ney and Montgomery, accompanied by their housekeeper, Cenci, emigrated to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], to a colony promoted as a resort for [[tuberculosis|consumptives]]. Their first son, Arthur (1871–1873) was born there, and second son, Lorne (1872–1913), was born in [[Red Wing, Minnesota]], during one of their travels.&lt;ref name="Elisabet Ney Emigration 1871-1873"/&gt;  Baron and Baroness von Stralendorff returned to [[Wismar, Germany]], where he died on July 1, 1872.&lt;ref name="Edmund Montgomery and Elisabet Ney papers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/smu/00145/smu-00145.html|title=Edmund Montgomery and Elisabet Ney papers|publisher=SMU|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New England Historical and Genealogical Register"&gt;{{cite book|last=New England Historic Genealogical Society Staff|title=The New England Historical and Genealogical Register|year=1873|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society Staff|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hermit Philosopher of Liendo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephens|first=Ira Kendrick|title=The Hermit Philosopher of Liendo|year=1951|publisher=Southern Methodist University Press|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, Ney traveled alone to Texas. With the help of German Consul Julius Runge in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], Ney was shown [[Liendo Plantation]] near [[Hempstead, Texas|Hempstead]] in [[Waller County, Texas|Waller County]].  On March 4, 1873, Montgomery and the rest of the family arrived, and he purchased it. While he tended to his research, Ney ran it for the next twenty years. Their son, Arthur, died of [[diphtheria]] in 1873.&lt;ref name="Elisabet Ney Liendo 1873-1891"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elisabet Ney Liendo 1873–1891|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/elisabetney/html/liendo.html|publisher=City of Austin Parks and Recreation Dept|accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="From Jamestown to Texas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meischen|first=Betty Smith|title=From Jamestown to Texas|year=2002|publisher=IUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-24223-8|pages=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomery was involved in an advisory capacity in the founding of [[Prairie View A&amp;M]], originally called Prairie View Normal School.&lt;ref name="Edmund Montromery"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stephens|first=I K|title=Edmund Montromery|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fmo10|work=Handbook of Texas online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Montgomery became a naturalized United States citizen, and thereafter became active in local politics and events. He served two terms as Waller County Road Commissioner and oversaw the building of an iron bridge across the [[Brazos River]].  In 1903, he was elected president of the Texas Academy of Science.&lt;ref name="Ney Museum-Edmund Montgomery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Texas Academy of Science 1892-1913"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward-McLemore|first=Ethel|title=Texas Academy of Science 1892–1913 |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/snt01|work=Handbook of Texas online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Montgomery died on April 17, 1911 after suffering a number of strokes and is buried next to Ney at Liendo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|50606132|Edmund Duncan Montgomery|accessdate={{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1762">'''Ethical formalism''' is a type of [[Ethics|ethical]] theory which defines moral judgments in terms of their [[logic]]al form (e.g., as "laws" or "universal prescriptions") rather than their content (e.g., as judgments about what actions will best promote human well-being). The term also often carries critical connotations. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], for example, has been criticized for defining morality in terms of the formal feature of being a "universal law", and then attempting to derive from this formal feature various concrete moral duties.

Ethical formalism is related to, but not identical to, [[Harry J. Gensler]]'s relatively recent (circa 1996) theory of [[formal ethics]].  Formal ethics is similar to ethical formalism in that it focuses on formal features of moral judgments, but is distinct in that the system of formal ethics is explicitly (and intentionally) incomplete.  Specifically, while some ethical formalist systems (e.g., arguably Kant's "universal laws") view a set of formal features as both necessary and sufficient, formal ethics views such formal features as necessary but not sufficient.

Ethical formalism is "considered as an absolutist system, if something is wrong, it is wrong all the time" (Pollock, 2004). Just the same, if something is right, it is then right all the time.

{{NSA surveillance}}
'''Fairview''' is a secret program under which the [[National Security Agency]] cooperates with the American telecommunications company [[AT&amp;T]] in order to collect phone, internet and e-mail data mainly of foreign countries' citizens at major cable landing stations and switching stations inside the United States. The FAIRVIEW program started in 1985, one year after the [[Bell breakup]].&lt;ref name=NYTPP2015&gt;New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/us/politics/att-helped-nsa-spy-on-an-array-of-internet-traffic.html?_r=0 AT&amp;T Helped U.S. Spy on Internet on a Vast Scale] &amp; Pro Publica, [https://www.propublica.org/article/nsa-spying-relies-on-atts-extreme-willingness-to-help NSA Spying Relies on AT&amp;T’s ‘Extreme Willingness to Help’], August 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate partner ==
The "key corporate partner" for cooperation under the FAIRVIEW program was first identified on October 23, 2013 by ''[[The Washington Post]]''—quoting NSA historian [[Matthew Aid]]—as
AT&amp;T.&lt;ref name=matthewAid&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2013/10/22/whats-the-deal-with-nsas-operation-names/ |title=What's the deal with NSA's operation names? |author=Emily Heil |work=The Washington Post |date=October 22, 2013 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=March 23, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHgpNwv5?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2013/10/22/whats-the-deal-with-nsas-operation-names/ |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was confirmed by a joint report by ''Pro Publica'' and ''The New York Times'' from August 15, 2015, based upon NSA documents that describe the company as "highly collaborative" and praise the company's "extreme willingness to help".&lt;ref name=NYTPP2015 /&gt;

In 2011, the FAIRVIEW program cost the NSA $188.9 million, which was twice as much as the costs for [[STORMBREW]], which is the second-largest program.&lt;ref name=NYTPP2015 /&gt;

== Scope of the program ==
According to 2013 revelations by whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The NSA partners with a large US telecommunications company ... [which] partners with telecoms in the foreign countries, [which] then allow the US company access to those countries' telecommunications systems, and that access is then exploited to direct traffic to the NSA's repositories.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/07/nsa-brazilians-globo-spying |title=The NSA's mass and indiscriminate spying on Brazilians |author=Glen Greenwald |work=The Guardian |date=July 7, 2013 |accessdate=2013-08-11 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6J5ahUofg?url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/07/nsa-brazilians-globo-spying |archivedate=August 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the revelations, the NSA had collected 2.3&amp;nbsp;billion separate pieces of data from Brazilian users in January 2013 alone.&lt;ref name="globo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/eua-espionaram-milhoes-de-mails-ligacoes-de-brasileiros-8940934 |title=EUA espionaram milhões de e-mails e ligações de brasileiros |author1=Glenn Greenwald |author2=Roberto Kaz |author3=José Casado |work=O Globo |date=July 6, 2013 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHg7um4t?url=http://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/eua-espionaram-milhoes-de-mails-ligacoes-de-brasileiros-8940934 |archivedate=March 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several weeks earlier, Snowden had revealed that the NSA was also harvesting the telephone [[metadata]] and text messages from over a billion subscribers in China; however, no precise program name was reported at the time.&lt;ref name="scmp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1266821/us-hacks-chinese-mobile-phone-companies-steals-sms-data-edward-snowden | title=EXCLUSIVE: US spies on Chinese mobile phone companies, steals SMS data: Edward Snowden |author1=Lana Lam |author2=Stephen Chen | work=South China Morning Post | date=June 22, 2013 | accessdate=2014-03-23 | archivedate=March 23, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323084637/http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1266821/us-hacks-chinese-mobile-phone-companies-steals-sms-data-edward-snowden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US-990 Fairview Map - crop.jpg|thumb|right|FAIRVIEW: Map shown on Brazilian television in 2013]]
A slide about the FAIRVIEW program that was seen on Brazilian television in 2013 showed a map with markers all over the United States, but without a legend that explained what they stood for. From a similar map with the proper legend, that was published in August 2015, it became clear that in 2010 the NSA had access to the following AT&amp;T facilities:&lt;ref&gt;Electrospaces.net, [http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2015/08/fairview-collecting-foreign.html FAIRVIEW: Collecting foreign intelligence inside the US], August 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* 8 [[internet peering point]]s
* 26 [[VoIP]] router facilities
* 1 VoIP hub router facility (with 30 planned)
* 9 submarine [[cable landing point]]s (with 7 planned)
* 16 [[4ESS]] circuit switching stations
Except for the VoIP facilities, most of these access points are situated along the US borders.

== Legal authorities ==
The collection of data under the FAIRVIEW program takes place under different legal authorities: [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]], which requires individualized warrants from the FISA Court, section 702 [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FAA]] for when one end of the communications if foreign, and the Transit Authority for when both ends of a communications are foreign.

Under the FAIRVIEW program, AT&amp;T also provided the NSA with domestic telephone metadata in bulk, which was authorized under section 215 of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]. First this was from landline connections, but in 2011, AT&amp;T also started handing over cell phone metadata: 1.1 billion a day.&lt;ref name=NYTPP2015 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4989">'Fault Reporting ''' is a maintenance concept that increases [[operational availability]] and that reduces [[operating cost]] through three mechanisms.
* Reduce labor-intensive diagnostic evaluation
* Eliminate diagnostic testing down-time
* Provide notification to management for degraded operation

This is a prerequisite for [[Condition-based maintenance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doni.daps.dla.mil/OPNAV.aspx|title=Opnav Instruction 4790.16: Condition Based Maintenance|publisher=US Navy Operations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Active redundancy]] can be integrated with fault reporting to reduce down time to a few minutes per year.
* Passive redundancy 
* Active redundancy

==History==

Formal maintenance philosophies are required by organizations whose primary responsibility is to ensure systems are ready when expected, such as space agencies and military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doni.daps.dla.mil/OPNAV.aspx|title=Opnav Instruction 4790.7: Maintenance Policy for United States Navy Ships|publisher=US Navy Operations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labor-intensive [[planned maintenance]] began during the rise of the industrial revolution. This depends upon periodic diagnostic evaluation based upon calendar dates, distance, or use. The intent is to accomplish diagnostic evaluations that indicate when maintenance is required to prevent inconvenience and safety issues that will occur when critical equipment failures occur during use.

The electronic revolution allowed inexpensive sensors and controls to be integrated into most equipment. This includes diagnostic indicators, fluid sensors, temperature sensors, ignition sensors, exhaust monitoring, voltage sensors, and similar monitoring equipment that indicates when maintenance is required. Sensor displays are often located in inaccessible locations that cannot be observed during normal operation. Labor-intensive periodic maintenance is often required to inspect indicators.

Some organizations have eliminated most labor-intensive periodic maintenance and diagnostic down time by implementing designs that bring all sensor status to fault indicators located in close proximity to users.

== Principle ==

Maintenance requires three actions.
* Fault discovery
* Fault isolation
* Fault recovery

Fault discovery requires diagnostic maintenance, which requires system down time and labor costs.

Down time and cost requirements associated with diagnostics are eliminated for every item that satisfies the following criteria.
* Automated diagnostic
* Instrumented for remote viewing
* Displayed in the viscidity of supervisory personnel

==Implementation==

Fault reporting is an optional feature that can be forwarded to remote displays using simple configuration setting in all modern computing equipment. The system level of reporting that is appropriate for [[Condition Based Maintenance]] are critical, alert, and emergency, which indicate software termination due to failure. Specific failure reporting, like interface failure, can be integrated into applications linked with these reporting systems. There is no development cost if these are incorporated into designs.
* [[Syslog]]
* [[Event Viewer|Event Log]]
* [[Power distribution unit]]

Other kinds of fault reporting involves painting green, yellow, and red zones onto temperature gages, pressure gages, flow gages, vibration sensors, strain gages, and similar sensors. Remote viewing can be implemented using a [[video camera]].

=== Benefits ===

The historical approach for '''Fault discovery'''  is periodic diagnostic testing, which eliminates the following operational availability penalty.

:&lt;math&gt;Availability \ Reduction = \frac{ Total \ Time }{Total \ Time + Maintenance \ Down \ Time } &lt;/math&gt;

Fault reporting eliminates maintenance costs associated manual diagnostic testing.

:&lt;math&gt;Diagnostic \ Cost = Maintenance \ Down \ Time \times Labor \ Rate \times \ Team \ Size&lt;/math&gt;

Labor is eliminated in redundant designs by using the fault discovery and fault isolation functions to automatically reconfigure equipment for degraded operation.

Maintenance savings can be re-allocated to upgrades and improvements that increase organizational competitiveness.

=== Detriments ===

Faults that do not trigger a sustained requirement for fault isolation and fault recovery actions should not be displayed for management action.

As an example, lighting up a fault indicator in situations where human intervention is not required will induce breakage by causing maintenance personnel to perform work when nothing is already broken.

As another example, enabling fault reporting for Internet network packet delivery failure will increase network loading when the network is already busy, and that will cause total network outage.

'''Feminist children's literature''' is the writing of [[children's literature]] through a feminist lens. Children's literature and [[women's literature]] have many similarities. Both often deal with being weak and placed towards the bottom of a hierarchy. In this way feminist ideas are regularly found in the structure of children's literature. Feminist criticism of children's literature is therefore expected, since it is a type of [[feminist literature]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nodelman|first1=Perry|title=Children's Literature as Women's Writing|journal=Children's Literature Association Quarterly|date=1988|volume=13.1|doi=10.1353/chq.0.0264|pages=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist children's literature has played a critical role for the [[feminist movement]], especially in the past half century. In her book ''Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics'', [[bell hooks]]&lt;!-- Lower-case is correct.--&gt; states her belief that all types of media, including writing and children's books, need to promote feminist ideals. She argues "Children's literature is one of the most crucial sites for feminist education for critical consciousness precisely because beliefs and identities are still being formed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hooks|first1=Bell|title=Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics|date=2000|publisher=South End|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of hooks' book, drawn by Laura DeSantis, depicts children alongside adults, showing the importance of the youth. The presence of feminism in children's literature has evolved over the years, but the overall message and goals have remained consistent.
{{Feminism sidebar}}

==Background==

===Overview===
During the second half of the twentieth century, children's literature and the feminist movement made many improvements together. A currently accepted method of thought for children's literature criticism in the academic world came to life during the 1970s, the same time that the second wave of [[feminist theory]] became popular. Early in the decade, feminist critics like [[Kate Millett]] explained how good writing was based on a belief that being a white male was normal and anyone else was a deviation from the normal.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} At this time, many female characters in children's books "play dead or doormats (as in 'Snow White', 'Cinderella', and 'Sleeping Beauty') or are severely mutilated (as in 'The Little Mermaid')".{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Due to the second wave of feminism, [[gender roles]] in all of the classic fairy tales (such as those by Grimm, Andersen, and Perrault) were starting to be questioned. Female heroes of the time were also inadequate. The women were simply "men tricked out in drag" and had the same exact plotlines as the male heroes. The only difference was that instead of needing to be rescued, the heroines did the rescuing.&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd / Books"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paul|first1=Lissa|title=Understanding Children's Literature|date=1998|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd / Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; More and more studies began emerging from children's literature. All the findings agreed that women were drastically underrepresented and given few options. Boys were overwhelmingly shown to be much more active and have adventures more frequently, while girls were passive and remained in the home with the adult women. Countless studies conducted over the years all had the same or similar results.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wigutoff|first1=Sharon|title=The Feminist Press: Ten Years of Nonsexist Children's Books.|journal=The Lion and the Unicorn|date=1979|volume=3.2|doi=10.1353/uni.0.0382|pages=57–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics and studies===
A study conducted in 1976 by the [[Feminist Press]] examined [[picture book]]s for children between the ages of four and eight published from 1972. Books were chosen if they contained the following themes: an active and adventurous girl protagonist, boys expressing multiple emotions and being sensitive, and non-traditional families that reflect multiple aspects of society. The picture books were then examined for [[gender stereotypes]] in primary and secondary characterizations, illustrations, and language. The results showed many instances of sexism. Out of a few thousand picture books published in the five-year span, fewer than 200 met the qualities needed. Although 35 publishers were represented by the books, only about six publishing houses made up the majority. Furthermore, most of the stories only had the first quality, which was a girl as an active protagonist. However, there was a problem in these stories as well. While the young main character could go out on adventures, the mother and grandmother characters were stuck in traditional roles. The study found limited examples of books that showed men as nurturing or of characters in non-traditional families. Only 143 books in the study were decided to be recommendable, 28 were somewhat recommendable, and 22 were not recommendable at all.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In 1989 a study was done in which the number of female and male characters in children's books was measured. It found that books from 1972 had female characters only 25% of the time, while in 1989 female characters were shown just as frequently as male characters. It also discovered that [[Caldecott]] winners and honor books were becoming more likely to have female characters, and that they were not given stereotyped roles as they were in the 1960s. In the late 1960s, only 1% of animal illustrations in Caldecott books were females. However, by the late 80s that number increased to 22%, and by the late 90s it was at about 72%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Roger|title=Why All The Counting? Feminist Social Science Research On Children's Literature.|journal=Children's Literature in Education|date=2002|volume=33.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three studies done in the late 1970s and early 80s yielded interesting results about what children like to have in their books. In 1975 [[Sally Jennings]] completed a study that found that kids around the age of four remember stories where characters do reversed-stereotyped things more than they remember stories where characters act according to classic gender roles. In 1978, a study by [[Sally Koblinksky]] found that by the age of 10 children better remember stories with stereotyped characters. A study done by [[Jerri Kropp]] and [[Charles Halverston]] in 1983 showed that children in preschool dislike hearing stories in which characters of the opposite gender act along gender stereotypes more than they dislike stories that have characters that do reverse-stereotyped things.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In the early 1990s several studies were carried out that showed an increase in equality in award-winning children's literature. The research found that only 11.1% of Caldecotts during 1967 to 1971 had female protagonist. During the years 1987 to 1991, however, 43.2% had main characters that were female. By the start of the twenty-first century, reverse-stereotyped roles in the protagonist were as popular as stereotyped roles during the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

By 1992 only 32% of [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prizes for fiction writing]], and a mere 8% of [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prizes in literature]], were awarded to women. However, women had won 66% of [[Newbery Medal]]s. The number of female authors producing children's literature was a strong factor in these  statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Beverly|title=Fair Godmothers or Wicked Stepmothers?: The Uneasy Relationship of Feminist Theory and Children's Criticism|journal=Children's Literature Association Quarterly|date=1993|volume=18.4|doi=10.1353/chq.0.0910|pages=171–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals of feminist children's literature==
While it is important for females and males to be depicted equally in children's books, that is not the main purpose of feminist children's literature. Children's books often focus on people or animals who do not have power because they are placed at the bottom of a hierarchy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Therefore, it is the goal of feminists to promote children's literature that gives children autonomy and the authority to speak and be heard. Books for children need to show how important it is to be able to listen and hear the accounts of others' stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Louise|title=Autonomy And Authorship: Storytelling In Children's Picture Books|journal=Hypatia|date=2010|volume=25.1|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.2010.01090.x|pages=174–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, feminist theory gives children the right to be included in the literary community, to no longer be oppressed by a hierarchical order of power.&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd / Books"/&gt; A final goal of feminists is to create non-sexist books that show what society is becoming. Promoting feminist theory without being labeled as a "message book" is crucial to the cause.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; By focusing on these goals, feminist authors hope to get their message across while still producing quality books for children.

==Another perspective==
Beginning in the 1960s, feminism began to appear in many forms of media because of the social changes taking place at the time. Feminists began to use children's books to spread a better understanding of feminism and the stereotypes of women. As children are a main target of the influential stereotypes of patriarchal mass media and important receptors of literature, they can be influenced by feminist literature to help abandon any learned stereotypes. Since [[second-wave feminism]], children's literature has been influenced by feminist theory and ideals, and is still growing as an influential media source in literature in today's society.

In ''Feminism is for Everybody'', [[bell hooks]] expresses her enthusiasm for spreading feminist ideals to everyone to prevent stereotypes and give people new perspectives on feminism. She argues that feminism needs to be shared through many sources of media so that its ideals are easily accessible to everyone. Feminist theory can be found in children's literature. Hooks states, "There should be so many little feminist primers, easy to read pamphlets and books, telling us all about feminism, that this book would be just another passionate voice speaking out on behalf of feminist politics".&lt;ref name="hooks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=hooks|first1=bell|title=Feminism is for Everybody|date=2000|publisher=South End Press|location=Cambridge|pages=vii, x|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist children's literature provides one form of this easy-to-read media. It either acts to highlight women and educate people about their history, or it subtly shares ideas of reversed gender roles where a female character might have more power.

Children's literature can be a valuable media source to influence children's views as they learn gender stereotypes and stereotypes about women in society. Feminism began to have an increasing presence in children's literature after second-wave feminism. According to [[Kinga Varga-Dobai]], second-wave feminist research had a huge impact on media such as children's literature.&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai"&gt;Kinga Varga-Dobai&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varga-Dobai|first1=Kinga|title=Gender Issues in Multicultural Children's Literature--Black and Third World Feminist Critiques of Appropriation, Essentialism, and Us/Other Binary Oppositions|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=13&amp;sid=8ff93d98-4948-416d-b159-0ce30bcd26c0%40sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=89660114|website=Multicultural Perspectives|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article by [[Abigail Feely]] states, "Children's books published during and after the second-wave feminists movement provide unique clues into the gradual normalization of feminist rhetoric into broader cultural context".&lt;ref name=Feely&gt;Abigail Feely&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feely|first1=Abigail|title=Picturing an Alternate Ending: Teaching Feminism and Social Change with The Paper Bag Princess|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=3edab4bd-e644-4654-857d-f3cc0ef5fdcb%40sessionmgr114&amp;hid=102&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=90007797|website=Ebscohost|publisher=The History Teacher|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varga-Dobai also states that the 1960s brought about the ideas of multicultural literature because of "shifting social and political perspectives on race, class, and gender." People began to pay more attention to the degree that children were being influenced by any ideologies embedded in children's books. Many feminists noticed that traditional folktales contained female characteristics that feminists did not agree with. Varga-Dobai says that female characters in children's novels began to be portrayed as more daring, active, and independent, in order to provide girls with a new image of an ideal female.&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai"/&gt;

The idea of a strong, independent female character in children's books plays into the topic of gender representation. According to Varga-Dobai, "The study of gender portrayals in children's literature has been closely informed by both cultural and feminist studies because women, as members of culture, have often been represented as the "other" in literature".&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai"/&gt; Therefore, feminists work to overcome any misrepresentations or stereotypes of gender in children's literature. Feminists want children to be educated through a feminist view so that their opinions are not as skewed when it comes to gender stereotypes and education of influential women. Also according to Varga-Dobai, "From a postconstructural feminist perspective, gender representations should allow for a more complex portrayal of subject positions available for female characters".&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai"/&gt; As second-wave feminism brought social change in women's positions in society, female characters also began to take on a social change, moving away from the traditional female characters.

One example of a children's book that includes feminist ideals that highlight females is ''Rad American Women A-Z'' by [[Kate Shatz]]. Inspired by her two-year-old daughter, Schatz wanted to create a book that educates children on women's history and also teaches them the alphabet. She noticed the gap in feminist-inspired children's literature. The book features inspirational women of different races whose names start with each letter of the alphabet. It highlights influential women, or "feminist heroes," who have made important accomplishments but may not be well known. This book not only intends to fill a hole in feminist literature for children, but also to address and represent race through the women that Schatz includes. This book begins to fulfill the need of "easy to read pamphlets and books" that hooks&lt;!-- Lower-case is correct.--&gt; discusses.&lt;ref name="Feinstein"&gt;Laura Feinstein&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feinstein|first1=Laura|title=Feminist Heroes to Teach Kids Their ABCs in Badass New Picturebook|url=http://magazine.good.is/articles/illustrated-feminist-heroes-to-teach-children-their-abcs|website=GOOD: A Magazine for the Global Citizen|publisher=GOOD Worldwide Inc|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent example of a feminist children's story that subtly speaks out about the issues of gender stereotypes is ''[[The Paper Bag Princess]]'' by [[Robert Munsch]]. Some{{who|date=September 2018}} consider this story to be the birth of feminist literature.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} It is a fairytale that has a strong female character and a feminist ending rather than a traditional story ending. The princess wears a paper bag and puts herself in danger to rescue the prince. However, the prince is ungrateful because she does not look like a real princess in her paper bag. Like many children's books, this story shows reversed roles of male and female characters, which reveals that feminist ideals are seeping into children's literature.

Children's literature can have a significant impact in the classroom. As children learn about issues of culture, feminist lenses are encouraging students to take on different perspectives. Learning through a feminist lens also encourages different views not only about gender representations, but also about race and class. It is believed that feminist theory can transform students' readings by how much they recognize the different gender patterns throughout literature. An article by Feely suggests, "Many radical and incorrect images of feminism persist in the popular imagination. At the same time, ironically, feminism has become so ingrained into mainstream culture that many students don't recognize it".&lt;ref name="Feely"/&gt; Feminism is sometimes skewed in the popular media, but it is also subtly fixed into culture{{clarification needed|date=September 2018}} in different ways such as through children's literature. As students learn, they are heavily influenced by mainstream culture, but incorporating children's literature into classroom settings can help expand opinions.

Feminist children's books are becoming more prevalent, but we are still in need of more female children's authors and books, according to hooks.&lt;!-- Lower-case is correct.--&gt; In hooks' opinion, "We are not there yet. But this is what we must do to share feminism, to let the movement into everybody's mind and heart".&lt;ref name="hooks"/&gt; She believes that there is still much to be done to spread the correct image of feminism, whether it is done through children's literature or through mainstream media sources. Feminism has become more prevalent in children's books since second-wave feminism, but there is still a gap in children's feminist literature that can continue to be filled.

== Ethics ==
Historically children’s books were written to entertain and educate children. However, new readings of children’s books reveal unethical concepts towards racism, gender and colonialism. New gender and feminist studies endeavour to right these wrongs. The goal is to unlearn previous negative attitudes of race and gender. Children’s learning is to be moulded in diversity and inclusivity is a moral principle and mutual obligation by parents, educators and the community. The ethics in children’s books guide the young reader to form basic concepts and fundamental principles of decent human conduct and essential equality. Ethics help children to shape the way they live, what they do, and how they make choices and values in their world.  
Since the mid -50s it has become vogue to reread and reinterpret classic children’s books. As to what children’s books should accomplish trouble cultural observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singer|first=Amy E.|date=2011|title="A Novel Approach: the Sociology of Literature, Children's Books, and Inequality."|url=|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Methods|volume=|pages=308|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they agree that the narratives in children’s books must delete unequal social arrangements: and instead of identifying inequality, describe, challenge, and subvert systems of inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singer|first=Amy E.|date=2011|title=“A Novel Approach: The Sociology of Literature, Children’s Books, and Inequality.”|url=|journal=International Journal of Qualitive Methods|volume=|pages=307|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalizations ==
Gender stereotypes found in innocent characters in fairy tales and racism and sexism found in the simplistic adventures of Thomas the Tank Engine do not give children positive role models.

The message in the Little Red Hen, teamwork and hard work, is overlooked and its main character has become a racist capitalist who refused to feed the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2017/10/new-regressive-sport-finding-racism-childrens-books/|title=The New Regressive Sport of Finding Racism and Sexism in Children’s Books.|last=|first=|date=|website=SB|archive-url=|archive-date=1 October 2017|dead-url=|access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Pan saves Tiger Lilly, and his heroic gesture is indicative of her as uneducated and savage because she is a female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2015/06/25/using-tinker-bell-to-shake-magic-into-everything-disney-peter-pan/|title=Using Tinker Bell to Shake Magic into Everything: Disney’s Peter Pan.|last=Ness|first=Mari|date=25 June 2015|website=Tor|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A picture book Rosie’s Walk, written by Pat Hutchinson, about a hen who is unaware that a fox is hunting her in the farmyard is seen as a symbol of ‘stupid womanhood.’ However, critics overlook the humours musings of Rosie’s walk around the farmyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Towenshend|first=John Rowe|date=1976|title="Racism and Sexism in Children's Books"|url=|journal=community|volume=5|pages=157-160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics in America suggest a rewriting of Cinderella in a ‘less sexist vein.’ Cinderella is too pretty; she has dishpan hands and flat feet because she does too much housework and Cinderella dances with too many men in one night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townshend|first=John Rowe|date=1976|title=“Racism and Sexism in Children’s Books,”|url=|journal=New Community 5|volume=5|pages=157-160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Famous Five, critics accuse Enid Blyton’s depiction of boys and girls as sexist. It is not enough for Georgina to be a leader if she looks like a girl. The character has to take on the persona of a boy by having short hair and demanding to be called George.

The independent, self-assertive, supergirl, Pippi Longstocking is but a boy in disguise.

These generalizations are counter-productive and divert from the more overtly severe cases, such as Little Black Sambo (1899). However, the author, Helen Bannerman had no obnoxious intentions; by default, she did not have a talent for drawing. Polar, written by Elaine Moss, about a polar bear, was rejected by an American publisher because the bear is ‘explicitly white.’

In an attempt to avoid stereotypes, girls are shown as strong, brave and resourceful, mothers go out to work, boys knit, and fathers cook cakes. Authors write, and editors publish in fear in absurd efforts to avoid giving offence. Another implication of these attitudes is a reverse gender stratification: girls cannot wear pink as it sets a gender norm of the feminine and boys must not wear blue as it sets a gender norm of masculine traits. However, because the unrealistic generalizations of gender representation in the debate on rewriting classic books, stripping them of all negative gender, sexism and racial bias continues.  Sarah Begley, Time (2017), advises parents to read with their children, ‘children are going to encounter it, and a safer way to learn how to counter it is via fiction. If you are reading a sexist/racist children’s book with a child, you can help them read it critically.’ Another critic, Malcolm Jones, cites from the National Coalition Against Censorship, PEN American Center, and the First Amendment Committee of American Society of Journalists and Authors who argued ‘while it is perfectly valid for critics to dispute a book’s historical accuracy and literary merits, the appropriate response is not to withdraw the volume and deprive readers of a chance to evaluate the book and the controversy for themselves.’

Amy Singer suggests children are deprived of great literature, exciting stories, mystery, and adventure in the rewriting of classical children’s books. Furthermore, these books are useful as historical evidence of how and what shaped people’s attitude in the time they were written and supply a source of debate of right and wrong and how we acknowledge that there is a better way to live. Moreover, studies by sociologists focus on the behaviour of boys and girls in books as an ideological reality of individual ability and character. In''Novel Readings''(1990) Marjorie DeVault suggests, ‘readers of a single novel create an individual understanding of that novel, alongside the meanings that the novel’s creator might have intended.’

However, Amy Singer, claims that ‘a subversive story for children will include not only strong role models at an individual level but also connections between social power and inequality.’ The questions Singer asks are how connected are the narratives of the protagonists to the social structures in which they live and do they implicate a subversive representation of the cultural stratification. The questionnaire that Singer developed in her analysis of children’s books takes into consideration the:

Book publication date, publisher, author and the elements of narrative texts. What is the books setting, who is the primary character, is there an implied reader and what is her/his implied body of knowledge?

Moreover, Ewick and Silbey suggest that children’s narratives can ‘support challenges to the status quo by illuminating a set of tactics for future use.' Children’s narratives can inspire change and can provide the exposure of power as a means to reverse that power. When children read books, they look for role models with leadership qualities. Due to the lack of female representation, girls are being denied positive role models to emulate. In order to dispel the belief there is only one way to identify as male or female in children’s books, a variety of characters, personality traits and behaviours are paramount in the writing of children’s books.

More important, children’s narratives can teach children how social arrangements are gendered and how they may determine their fates. The role model that characters play out and their narratives can draw attention to social relationships and teach young readers to think critically about what they read. Furthermore, to expose young readers to social systems and inequality will teach them how the world is organised and how they might be negotiated or challenged.

The '''Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development''' highlights the role that states and [[civil society]] must play in preventing and reducing violence associated with war, crime, and [[social unrest]]. The Declaration was adopted on 7 June 2006 and is now endorsed by 113 states. It is the strongest political statement to date that addresses the impact of armed violence within a development context. Regular high-level diplomatic regional meetings and ministerial review conferences take place to assess progress concerning the process and implementation of the Geneva Declaration; the first two ministerial review conferences took place in 2008 and 2011. During 2014 a series of Regional Review Conferences have been organized not only to review the process in implementing the Geneva Declaration but also to reflect and gather support in integrating meaningfully armed violence reduction in national and international development processes, including the post-2015 development agenda.

By signing the Geneva Declaration states commit to:&lt;ref&gt;Geneva Declaration Secretariat. 2008. ''The Global Burden of Armed Violence. Geneva: Geneva Declaration Secretariat&lt;/ref&gt;

* Support initiatives to measure the human, social and economic costs of armed violence;
* Undertake assessments to understand and respond to risks and vulnerabilities;
* Evaluate the effectiveness of armed violence prevention and reduction programs around the world; and
* To disseminate lessons and best practices.

Understanding that the fight against the global scourge of armed violence and the prospects for sustainable development are closely linked, the signatories recognize that armed violence constitutes a major obstacle to the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Geneva-Declaration-Millennium-Development-Goals.pdf Armed Violence Prevention and Reduction: A Challenge for Achieving the Millennium Development Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; They agree to strengthen their efforts to integrate [[armed violence reduction]] and conflict prevention programs into national, regional, and multilateral development frameworks and strategies.

The approach is based on three pillars:

# Advocacy: dissemination and coordination initiatives for implementing the Geneva Declaration
# Measurability: country based armed violence mapping and monitoring to identify entry-points and opportunities for interventions
# Programming: practical programming on armed violence prevention and reduction

A Core Group of 14 signatory states and affiliated organizations is responsible for steering the process and guiding the implementation of the Geneva Declaration. Affiliated organizations include the Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (BCPR) of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), the [[Small Arms Survey]]—which also hosts the Geneva Declaration Secretariat—, the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[Quaker United Nations Office]] (QUNO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/the-geneva-declaration/how-does-it-work.html | title=The Geneva Declaration - How does it work?

A '''gravity tractor''' is a theoretical [[spacecraft]] that would deflect another object in space, typically a [[potentially hazardous object|potentially hazardous asteroid]] that might impact Earth, without physically contacting it, using only its [[gravitational field]] to transmit the required [[impulse (physics)|impulse]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward T. Lu and Stanley G. Love (10 November 2005), [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7065/abs/438177a.html Gravitational tractor for towing asteroids], ''Nature'' '''438''':177–178, {{doi|10.1038/438177a}}. Also, see [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0509595 astro-ph/0509595] in the [[ArXiv.org e-print archive|arXiv]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yeomans, D.K. et al. (2005) [http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/acm2008/pdf/8273.pdf Using a Gravity Tractor to Help Mitigate Asteroid Collisions with Earth]&lt;/ref&gt;  The gravitational force of a nearby space vehicle, though minuscule, is able to alter the trajectory of a much larger asteroid if the vehicle spends enough time close to it; all that is required is that the vehicle thrust in a consistent direction relative to the asteroid's trajectory, and that neither the vehicle nor its expelled reaction mass come in direct contact with the asteroid.  The tractor spacecraft could either hover near the object being deflected, or orbit it, directing its exhaust perpendicular to the plane of the orbit. The concept has two key advantages: namely that essentially nothing needs to be known about the mechanical composition and structure of the asteroid in advance; and that the relatively small amounts of force used enable extremely precise manipulation and determination of the asteroid's orbit around the [[sun]].  Whereas other methods of deflection would require the determination of the asteroid's exact center of mass, and considerable effort might be necessary to halt its spin or rotation, by using the tractor method these considerations are irrelevant.

==Advantages==
A number of considerations arise concerning means for avoiding a devastating collision with an asteroidal object, should one be discovered on a trajectory that were determined to lead to Earth impact at some future date.  One of the main challenges is how to transmit the [[impulse (physics)|impulse]] required (possibly quite large), to an asteroid of unknown mass, composition, and mechanical strength, without shattering it into fragments, some of which might be themselves dangerous to Earth if left in a collision orbit.
The gravity tractor solves this problem by gently accelerating the object as a whole over an extended period of time, using the spacecraft's own mass and associated gravitational field to effect the necessary deflecting force.
Because of the [[Universal gravitation|universality of gravitation]], affecting as it does all mass alike, the asteroid would be accelerated almost uniformly as a whole, with only [[tidal force]]s (which should be extremely small) causing any stresses to its internal structure.

A further advantage is that a [[transponder]] on the spacecraft, by continuously monitoring the position and velocity of the tractor/asteroid system, could enable the post-deflection trajectory of the asteroid to be accurately known, ensuring its final placement into a safe orbit.&lt;ref&gt;''Threat Mitigation: The Gravity Tractor''&amp;nbsp; (2006) Schweickart, Russell; Chapman, Clark; Durda, Dan; Hut, Piet, Submitted to NASA Workshop on Near-Earth Objects, Vail, Colorado, June 2006 [arXiv:physics/0608157.pdf], available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0608157]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Limitations of the tractor concept include the exhaust configuration. With the most efficient hovering design (that is, pointing the exhaust directly at the target object for maximum force per unit of fuel), the expelled reaction mass hits the target head-on, imparting a force in exactly the opposite direction to the gravitational pull of the tractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = New Scientist: Letter to editor re: gravity tractor article, with author response|url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19526151.400-asteroid-deflection.html |date = 2007-08-04 |accessdate = 2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would therefore be necessary to use the orbiting-tractor scheme described below, or else design the hovering tractor so that its exhaust is directed at a slight angle away from the object, while still pointing "down" enough to keep a steady hover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/b612_report.html |title= NEAR-EARTH OBJECT (NEO) ANALYSIS OF TRANSPONDER TRACKING AND GRAVITY TRACTOR PERFORMANCE |author= [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] |author2= D.K. Yeomans |author3=S. Bhaskaran |author4=S.B. Broschart |author5=S.R. Chesley |author6=P.W. Chodas |author7=M.A. Jones |author8=T.H. Sweetser |date= September 22, 2008 |publisher= [[B612 Foundation]] |pages= 17–22 |format= Microsoft Word (.doc) |accessdate= April 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires greater thrust and correspondingly increased fuel consumption for each [[Metre per second|metre per second]] change in the target's velocity.

Issues of the effect of [[ion propulsion]] thrust on the dust of asteroids have been raised, suggesting that alternative means to control the [[orbital stationkeeping|station keeping]] position of the gravity tractor may need to be considered. In this respect, [[solar sail]]s have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=22765 The Asteroid and the Telescope], Paul Gilster, Centauri Dreams News, 2012-05-03, accessed 2012-05-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Rusty Schweickart]], the gravitational tractor method is also controversial because during the process of changing an asteroid's trajectory the point on Earth where it could most likely hit would be slowly shifted across different countries. It means that the threat for the entire planet would be minimized at the cost of some specific states' security. In Schweickart's opinion, choosing the way the asteroid should be "dragged" would be a tough diplomatic decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/12/saving-earth-from-an-asteroid/ | title=Saving Earth From an Asteroid Will Take Diplomats, Not Heroes | last=Madrigal | first=Alexis | date=16 December 2009 | publisher=[[WIRED]] | accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
To get a feel for the magnitude of these issues, let us suppose that a [[Near-Earth object|NEO]] of size around 100 m, and mass of one million metric tons, threatened to impact Earth.  Suppose also that

* a velocity correction of 1&amp;nbsp;centimetre per second would be adequate to place it in a safe and stable orbit, missing Earth
* that the correction needed to be applied within a period of 10 years.

With these parameters, the required impulse would be: ''V''&amp;nbsp;× ''M''&amp;nbsp; = 0.01 [m/s]×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; [kg] = 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; [N-s], so that the average tractor force on the asteroid for 10 years (which is 3.156×10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; seconds), would need to be about 0.032 [[Newton (unit)|newtons]].
An ion-electric spacecraft with a specific impulse of 10,000 N-s per kg, corresponding to an ion beam velocity of 10&amp;nbsp;kilometres per second (about 20 times that obtained with the best chemical rockets), would require 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg of reaction mass ([[xenon]] is currently favored) to provide the impulse.
The kinetic power of the ion beam would then be approximately 158 watts; the input electric power to the power converter and ion drive would of course be substantially higher.
The spacecraft would need to have enough mass and remain sufficiently close to the asteroid that the component of the average gravitational force on the asteroid in the desired direction would equal or exceed the required 0.032 newtons.
Assuming the spacecraft is hovering over the asteroid at a distance of 200 m to its centre of mass, that would
require it to have a mass of about 20 metric tonnes, because due to the [[gravitational force]] we
have

&lt;math&gt;
m_2 = \frac{F r^2}{G m_1}
=\frac{0.032[N] \times (200[m])^2}{6.674 \times 10^{-11} [N m^2 kg^{-2}] \times 10^9 [kg]}
\approx 19200 kg
&lt;/math&gt;

Considering possible hovering positions or orbits of the tractor around the asteroid, note that if two objects are gravitationally bound in a mutual orbit, then if one receives an arbitrary impulse which is less than that needed to free it from orbit around the other, because of the gravitational forces between them, the impulse will alter the momentum of both, together regarded as a composite system.
That is, so long as the tractor remains in a bound orbit, any propulsive force applied to it will be effectively transferred to the asteroid it orbits.
This permits a wide variety of orbits or hovering strategies for the tractor.
One obvious possibility is for the spacecraft to orbit the NEO with [[Normal (geometry)|the normal]] to the orbit in the direction of the desired force.
The ion beam would then be directed in the opposite direction, also perpendicular to the orbit plane.  This would result in the plane of the orbit being shifted somewhat away from the center of the asteroid, "towing" it, while the orbital velocity, normal to the thrust, remains constant.  The orbital period would be a few hours, essentially independent of size, but weakly dependent on the density of the target body.

'''Hilde Lindemann''' (also ''Hilde Lindemann Nelson'') is an American philosophy professor and bioethicist currently teaching at [[Michigan State University]]. Lindemann earned her B.A. in German language and literature in 1969 at the [[University of Georgia]]. Lindemann also earned her M.A. in theatre history and dramatic literature, in 1972, at the [[University of Georgia]]. Lindemann began her career as a copyeditor for several universities ([http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/no-ethics-without-feminism/ Interview at 3AM Magazine]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/no-ethics-without-feminism/|title=No ethics without feminism|website=3:AM Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;). She then moved on to a job at the Hastings Center in New York City, an institute focused on bioethics research, and co-authored book ''The Patient in the Family'' before deciding to earn a Ph.D. in philosophy at [[Fordham University]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Previously, she taught at the [[University of Tennessee]] and [[Vassar College]] and served as the associate editor of the [[Hastings Center Report]] (1990–95). Lindemann currently teaches courses on [[feminist philosophy]], identity and agency, naturalized bioethics, and narrative approaches to bioethics at Michigan State University.

==Contributions to philosophy==
Lindemann's work primarily focuses on feminist bioethics, the ethics of families, feminist ethics, and the social construction of identities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She is the former editor of ''[[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy]]'' and was also coeditor, with [[Sara Ruddick]] and [[Margaret Urban Walker]], of the Feminist Constructions series for Rowman &amp; Littlefield. In addition, she coedited, with James Lindemann Nelson, a series on Reflective Bioethics for Routledge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Lindemann is a [[Hastings Center]] Fellow, a member of the advisory board for the Women’s Bioethics Project (2006–), and was the president of the [[American Society for Bioethics and Humanities]] (2008–2009).

Hilde Lindemann is a narrative [[ethicist]]. A narrative approach uses stories and relationships between people in specific cases, as well as generalizable examples, for moral contexts and discussion (Gotlib&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fem-e-n/|title=Feminist Ethics and Narrative Ethics {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Two of her books, ''Holding and Letting Go: The Social Practice of Personal Identities'' and ''Alzheimer's: Answers to Hard Questions for Families,'' co-authored by her partner James Lindemann Nelson, have various reviews that summarize philosophical theories and ethics demonstrated in her works.

The review of ''Holding and Letting Go: The Social Practice of Personal Identities'' and ''Alzheimer's Answer to Hard Questions for Families'' explains that Lindemann adopts a non-obscure, story-related approach to make readers think about realistic situations: "Only when we see ethical lives as diachronically and interpersonally structured and as embedded in narratively rich contexts can ethical reflection take hold in actual persons' lives" (Christman&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/57247-holding-and-letting-go-the-social-practice-of-personal-identities/|title=Holding and Letting Go: The Social Practice of Personal Identities // Reviews // Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews // University of Notre Dame|last=Dame|first=ENR // AgencyND // University of Notre|website=ndpr.nd.edu|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The review of the co-authored book, ''Alzheimer's: Answers to Hard Questions for Families'', also demonstrates that Lindemann employs case studies and life experiences for the patients and caregivers to convey ideas in her work (Moody&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moody|first=Harry|date=Jun 1, 1998|title=James Lindemann Nelson and Hilde Lindemann Nelson, "Alzheimer's Answer to Hard Questions for Families" (Book Review)|url=http://search.proquest/docview/1303258761|journal=The Journal of Value Inquiry|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This method of provoking thought is aimed at a wide general audience of people who are not necessarily ethics scholars.

==Quotes on philosophy==
* "I think it’s a great mistake to see feminism as a war on men. Men aren’t responsible for the subordination of women – they just benefit from it. It’s not politically useful to set men up as the enemy, because that alienates people whom we need as allies. And it perpetuates the victor/vanquished, master/slave relation that’s the whole problem in the first place. If the gender system is ever to be dismantled, it won’t be by declaring war on men. It’s much better to affirm lots of differences among people without insisting that differences have to be ordered into power hierarchies"([http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/no-ethics-without-feminism/ Interview at 3AM Magazine] 2012&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;).
* "Narrativists have claimed, among other things, that stories of one kind or another are required: (1) to teach us our duties, (2) to guide morally good action, (3) to motivate morally good action, (4) to justify action on moral grounds, (5) to cultivate our moral sensibilities, (6) to enhance our moral perception, (7) to make actions of persons morally intelligible, and (8) to reinvent ourselves as better persons (Nelson 2001, 36)." (Gotlib&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

==Selected honors and grants==
&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Most recently, Hilde Lindemann served as President-Elect (2007–2008) and President (2008–2009) for the American Society of Bioethics and Humanities. She was elected a Hastings Center Fellow in October 2004.

Lindemann has received two NWO (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research) grants, one of €30,000, plus €3,000 each from Michigan State University, Newcastle University, Uppsala University, and Lübeck University to build a network on the ethics of families and care (2013–2016). The other NWO grant (with Marian Verkerk and Margaret Urban Walker) of €25,000, plus the equivalent of €3,500 each from Michigan State University and Arizona State University, for an international collaboration to produce a bioethics whose moral epistemology and psychology are naturalized and whose ethical focus is on practices of responsibility (2004–2008).

She has also won awards such as the American Society of Bioethics and Humanities Distinguished Service Award (2003) and National Endowment for the Humanities grant to conduct a Summer Seminar for College and University Teachers, entitled “Bioethics in Particular,” $87,000. Project Co-Director (1999–2000). Lindemann was named a Fulbright scholar (1969) and a Woodrow Wilson fellow (1969).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4848">'''Hume's principle''' or '''HP'''—the terms were coined by [[George Boolos]]—says that the number of ''F''s is equal to the number of ''G''s if and only if there is a [[one-to-one correspondence]] (a [[bijection]]) between the ''F''s and the ''G''s. HP can be stated formally in systems of [[second-order logic]]. Hume's principle is named for the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]].

HP plays a central role in [[Gottlob Frege]]'s philosophy of mathematics. Frege shows that HP and suitable definitions of arithmetical notions [[logical consequence|entail]] all axioms of what we now call [[second-order arithmetic]]. This result is known as [[Frege's theorem]], which is the foundation for a philosophy of mathematics known as [[Logicism#Neo-logicism|neo-logicism]].

== Origins ==
Hume's principle appears in Frege's ''Foundations of Arithmetic'' (§73), which quotes from Part III of Book I of [[David Hume]]'s ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1740). Hume there sets out seven fundamental relations between ideas. Concerning one of these, [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] in [[quantity]] or [[number]], Hume argues that our reasoning about proportion in quantity, as represented by [[geometry]], can never achieve "perfect precision and exactness", since its principles are derived from sense-appearance. He contrasts this with reasoning about number or [[arithmetic]], in which such a precision ''can'' be attained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Algebra and arithmetic [are] the only sciences in which we can carry on a chain of reasoning to any degree of intricacy, and yet preserve a perfect exactness and certainty. We are possessed of a precise standard, by which we can judge of the equality and proportion of numbers; and according as they correspond or not to that standard, we determine their relations, without any possibility of error. ''When two numbers are so combined, as that the one has always a unit answering to every unit of the other, we pronounce them equal''; and it is for want of such a standard of equality in [spatial] extension, that geometry can scarce be esteemed a perfect and infallible science. (I. III. I.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note Hume's use of the word ''[[number]]'' in the ancient sense, to mean a set or collection of things rather than the common modern notion of "positive integer". The ancient Greek notion of number (''arithmos'') is of a finite plurality composed of units. See [[Aristotle]], ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', 1020a14 and [[Euclid]], ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', Book VII, Definition 1 and 2. The contrast between the old and modern conception of number is discussed in detail in Mayberry (2000).

== Influence on set theory ==
The principle that [[cardinal number]] was to be characterized in terms of [[one-to-one correspondence]] had previously been used to great effect by [[Georg Cantor]], whose writings [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] knew. The suggestion has therefore been made that Hume's principle ought better be called "Cantor's Principle". But Frege criticized Cantor on the ground that Cantor defines [[cardinal number]]s in terms of [[ordinal number]]s, whereas Frege wanted to give a characterization of cardinals that was independent of the ordinals. Cantor's point of view, however, is the one embedded in contemporary theories of [[transfinite number]]s, as developed in [[axiomatic set theory]].

The '''ITS launch vehicle''' was a 2016-2017 design for a [[private spaceflight|privately funded]] [[orbital spaceflight|orbital]] [[launch vehicle]] planned to be developed by [[SpaceX]].  Design work was discontinued in 2017 when development was shifted to a smaller version, now called [[BFR (rocket)|BFR]].&lt;ref name=issR&amp;Dconf20170719-49:48/&gt; 
The initial design objective of the ITS launch vehicle was to launch a variety of SpaceX [[Interplanetary Transport System]] missions to [[Mars]] and other destinations in the [[beyond Earth orbit|beyond-Earth-orbit]] portion of the [[Solar System]]. The first launch was not expected before the 2020s.&lt;ref name=sn20160927/&gt; 

The ITS launch vehicle was to be operated as a somewhat unusual [[multistage rocket|two-stage]] rocket. Its first stage was to have been powered by 42 [[Raptor (rocket engine family)|Raptor rocket engines]]—designed and manufactured by SpaceX—operating on [[subcooling|densified]] (chilled near [[Methane (data page)|triple point]]) [[liquid methane|methane]]/[[liquid oxygen|oxygen]], [[propellant]]s that have not been widely used as rocket propellants in the past. Like the [[Falcon 9]] orbital launch vehicle that preceded it, the ITS launch vehicle's [[Multistage rocket|first stage]] design was intended to be [[reusable launch system|reusable]], following a [[Return to Launch Site|return to the launch site]] and [[VTVL|vertical landing]] following each launch. When announced, it was also designed to have a new feature for SpaceX launch vehicles:  full reusability of even the second-stage and orbital spacecraft as well.  The large payload capacity of the launch vehicle placed it into the [[Super heavy-lift launch vehicle|super-heavy lift]] class, with the ability to place {{convert|300|tonnes|lb}} into [[low Earth orbit]] in [[reusable launch vehicle|reusable]] configuration and {{convert|550|tonnes|lb}} in [[expendable launch vehicle|expendable]] mode.&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/&gt;

The [[second stage]] of the Earth launch vehicle was planned to have two versions, the ''Interplanetary spaceship'' for passengers and cargo and the ''ITS tanker'' to deliver [[Rocket propellant|propellants]] to Earth orbit. Both were to be powered by six vacuum-optimized Raptor rocket engines with three additional sea-level-nozzle Raptor engines for maneuvering.  Thus, the element of the launch vehicle that was to provide second-stage acceleration to [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]] on all launches from Earth would also be used as an on-orbit spacecraft.  The ''Interplanetary spaceship'' was planned as a very long-duration carrier of both [[human spaceflight|passengers]] and space cargo to [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary destinations]], and was to have served as both a [[Mars landing|descent]] and ascent vehicle at Mars.

The high-level specifications for the vehicle were publicly announced in September 2016, but by July 2017, SpaceX had stated they would not build the {{cvt|12|m|adj=on}}-diameter vehicles as previously planned, but would instead build a "still large" but much smaller launch vehicle first.&lt;ref name=issR&amp;Dconf20170719-49:48/&gt; Subsequently, that was revealed to be the [[BFR (rocket)|BFR]] in September 2017, a vehicle intended to cost-effectively replace and supersede all existing SpaceX launch vehicles and passenger/cargo spacecraft.&lt;ref name=sn20170929/&gt;&lt;ref name=verge20170926/&gt;

== History ==

The launch vehicle was initially mentioned in public discussions by [[Elon Musk]] in 2012 as part of SpaceX{{'s}} description of its overall Mars system architecture, then known as the ''Mars Colonial Transporter'' (MCT).&lt;ref name=dn20121213/&gt;  MCT was [[SpaceX]]'s name for its [[private equity|privately funded]] [[New product development|development project]] to design and build a spaceflight system&lt;ref name=nsf20140307/&gt; of [[reusable launch vehicle|reusable]] [[rocket engine]]s, [[launch vehicle]]s and [[space capsule]]s to eventually [[human mission to Mars|transport humans to Mars]] and return them to [[Earth]].

As early as 2007 however, Musk had stated a personal goal of eventually enabling [[exploration of Mars|human exploration]] and [[colonization of Mars|settlement of Mars]].&lt;ref name=wired20070522&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=Carl|title=Elon Musk Is Betting His Fortune on a Mission Beyond Earth's Orbit|url=https://www.wired.com/science/space/magazine/15-06/ff_space_musk?currentPage=all| accessdate=2014-03-14| newspaper=Wired Magazine| date=2007-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mw20110422&gt;{{cite news|title=Elon Musk: I'll Put a Man on Mars in 10 Years |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/video/asset/elon-musk-ill-put-a-man-on-mars-in-10-years-2011-04-22/CCF1FC62-BB0D-4561-938C-DF0DEFAD15BA#!CCF1FC62-BB0D-4561-938C-DF0DEFAD15BA |newspaper=Market Watch |date=2011-04-22 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |location=New York |accessdate=2011-12-01 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63bvaGo3E?url=http://www.marketwatch.com/video/asset/elon-musk-ill-put-a-man-on-mars-in-10-years-2011-04-22/CCF1FC62-BB0D-4561-938C-DF0DEFAD15BA |deadurl=no |archivedate=1 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bits of additional information about the mission architecture were released in 2011–2015, including a 2014 statement that initial colonists would arrive at Mars no earlier than the middle of the 2020s,&lt;ref name=dn20121213/&gt; and SpaceX began development of the large [[Raptor (rocket engine family)|Raptor rocket engine]] for the Mars Colonial Transporter before 2014.

Musk stated in a 2011 interview that he hoped to send humans to Mars' surface within 10–20 years,&lt;ref name=mw20110422/&gt; and in late 2012 that he envisioned the first colonists arriving no earlier than the middle of the 2020s.&lt;ref name=dn20121213&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/mars-colony-spacex-121126.htm |title=Huge Mars Colony Eyed by SpaceX Founder |date=2012-12-13 |accessdate=2016-09-25 |publisher=Discovery News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian20130717&gt;

In October 2012, Musk first publicly articulated a high-level plan to build a second reusable rocket system with capabilities substantially beyond the [[Falcon 9]]/[[Falcon Heavy]] launch vehicles on which SpaceX had by then spent several billion US dollars.&lt;ref name=fg20121015&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/spacex-aims-big-with-massive-new-rocket-377687/ |title=SpaceX aims big with massive new rocket |date=15 Oct 2012 |author=Zach Rosenberg |accessdate=2016-09-25 |publisher=Flight Global }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new vehicle was to be "an evolution of SpaceX's Falcon 9 booster ... much bigger [than Falcon 9]." But Musk indicated that SpaceX would not be speaking publicly about it until 2013.&lt;ref name=dn20121213/&gt;&lt;ref name=sdc20121123&gt;

We’ll speak about that next year. ... Vertical landing is an extremely important breakthrough — extreme, rapid reusability.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2013, Musk stated that he intended to hold off any potential [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] of SpaceX shares on the stock market until after the "Mars Colonial Transporter is flying regularly."&lt;ref name=forbes20130606&gt;

In February 2014, the principal payload for the MCT launch vehicle was announced to be a large [[Interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary spacecraft]] named Mars Colonial Transporter, capable of carrying up to {{convert|100|tonne|lb}} of passengers and cargo.&lt;ref name=gq20151212/&gt; Musk stated that Mars Colonial Transporter will be "100 times the size of an [[SUV]]".&lt;ref name=pbt20140219&gt;

According to SpaceX engine development head [[Tom Mueller]], concept designs at the time indicated SpaceX could use nine [[Raptor (rocket engine family)|Raptor]] engines on a single rocket, similar to the use of nine [[Merlin (rocket engine family)#Merlin 1D|Merlin]] engines on each [[Falcon 9]] booster core, in order "to put over 100 tons of cargo on Mars."&lt;ref name=pbt20140219/&gt;
At that time, it appeared that the large rocket core that would be used for the [[Booster (rocketry)|booster]]&lt;!-- the source is not clear as to exactly how many cores might make up an MCT booster rocket --&gt; to be used with MCT would be at least {{convert|10|m|sp=us}} in diameter—nearly three times the diameter and over seven times the cross-sectional area of the [[Falcon 9]] booster cores—and was expected to have up to three rocket cores with a total of at least 27 engines.&lt;ref name=nsf20140307&gt;

By August 2014, media sources speculated that the initial [[flight test]] of the Raptor-driven super-heavy launch vehicle could occur as early as 2020, in order to fully test the engines under orbital spaceflight conditions; however, any colonization effort was then reported to continue to be "deep into the future".&lt;ref name=nsf20140830&gt;

== Description and technical specifications ==

The ITS launch vehicle stack is composed of two stages.  The first stage is always an ''interplanetary booster'' while the second stage may be either an ''interplanetary spaceship'' (for beyond-Earth-orbit missions) or an ''ITS tanker'' (for on-orbit propellant transfer operations).

Both stages of the ITS launch vehicle were to be powered by [[Raptor (rocket engine family)|Raptor]] [[bipropellant|bipropellant liquid]] [[rocket engine]]s utilizing the [[full flow staged combustion cycle]] with [[liquid methane]] fuel and [[liquid oxygen]] oxidizer.&lt;ref name=nsf20150511&gt;
{{cite news |last1=Bergin|first1=Chris |title=Falcon Heavy enabler for Dragon solar system explorer |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/05/falcon-heavy-dragon-solar-system-explorer/ |accessdate=12 May 2015 |work=NASASpaceFlight.com |date=2015-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both propellants will be fully in the [[gas phase]] before entering the Raptor [[combustion chamber]].&lt;ref name=nsf20140307/&gt; Both stages will utilize a bleed-off of the high-pressure gas for autogenous pressurization of the propellant tanks, eliminating the problematic high-pressure [[helium]] pressurization system used in the [[Falcon 9]] launch vehicle.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt;
The self-pressurization gas system is a critical part of SpaceX strategy to reduce launch vehicle fluids from five in their legacy Falcon 9 vehicle family to just two, eliminating not only the helium tank pressurant but all [[hypergolic propellant]]s as well as [[nitrogen]] for cold-gas reaction-control thrusters.&lt;ref name=nsf20161003/&gt;

The overall launch vehicle height, first stage and the integrated second-stage/spacecraft, will be {{cvt|122|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=MuskTweetPreSpeech&gt;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/780831628104966144&lt;/ref&gt; Both stages of the ITS LV will be constructed of lightweight-yet-strong [[carbon fiber]], even the [[deep cryogenic|deep-cryogenic]] propellant tanks,&lt;!-- an initial ground-test article tank has already been built and test of the carbon fiber material and construction technique, as of Sep 2016. --&gt; a major change from the [[aluminum-lithium alloy]] tank and structure material used in SpaceX Falcon 9 family of launch vehicles.

[[File:Interplanetary Transport System (29937260386).jpg|thumb|300px|Rendering of the reusable ITS booster in descent]]

===ITS booster===

The first-stage '''ITS booster'''&lt;!-- Bolded per [[WP:MOS]]/[[WP:MOSBOLD]] as redirected term to this article section --&gt;, or Interplanetary booster—is a {{convert|12|m|ft|0|abbr=on|adj=on}}-diameter, {{convert|77.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on|adj=on}}-high, reusable rocket &lt;!-- with a dry mass of {{cvt|1234|MT|ST|0|abbr=on}} --&gt;powered by 42 sea-level rated [[Raptor (rocket engine)|Raptor engines]] producing over {{convert|3024|kN|lbf}} of [[thrust]] in each engine. Total booster thrust is approximately {{convert|29000000|lbf|MN|order=flip|abbr=on}}, several times the {{convert|8000000|lbf|MN|order=flip|abbr=on}} thrust of the [[Saturn V]] Moon mission launch vehicle.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;

The engine configuration will include 21 engines in the outer ring and 14 in the inner ring, with these 35 engines fixed in place.  The center cluster of seven engines are [[gimbaled thrust|gimbaled]] for directional control, although some directional control to the rocket is also available by utilizing [[Differential engine thrust|differential thrust]] on the fixed engines.  Design thrust on each engine is [[rocket engine throttling|variable]] between 20 and 100 percent of rated thrust.&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt;

Methane/oxygen will also be used to power the [[reaction control system|control thrusters]], as [[cold gas thruster|gas thrusters]] rather than the subcooled liquid used to power the main engines. The methalox control thrusters will be used to control booster orientation in space, as well as to help provide additional accuracy in landing once the velocity of the descending booster has slowed.&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt;

The design is intended to use about seven percent of the total propellant load at launch in order to support the reusable aspect and bring the booster [[Return To Launch Site|back to the launch pad]] for a [[VTVL|vertical landing]], assessment, and relaunch,&lt;ref name=sfi20160927&gt;

&lt;!-- NOTE: this is right in the middle of the original (2012) early-design range given for Falcon 9-Reusable ({{nowrap|2.0 km/s}} {{nowrap|(6,500 km/h; 4,100 mph; Mach 6)}}) vs Falcon 9-Expendable ({{nowrap|3.4 km/s}} {{nowrap|(11,000 km/h; 7,000 mph; Mach 10)}}) as sourced in refname=pm20120207 in the  "[[SpaceX reusable launch system development program]]" article. --&gt;
During [[atmospheric reentry]], once the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] is sufficiently dense, [[grid fin]]s will be used to control the attitude of the rocket and fine tune the landing location.&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt;
The booster return flights are expected to encounter loads that are lower than those experienced on the Falcon 9 rentries, principally because it will have both a lower mass ratio and a lower density than Falcon 9.&lt;ref name=gw20161023/&gt;
The booster will be designed for 20&amp;nbsp;[[G's|G]] nominal loads, and possibly as high as 30–40&amp;nbsp;G's without breaking up.&lt;ref name=gw20161023/&gt;

In contrast to the landing approach used on SpaceX mid-2010s reusable rocket first stages—either a large, flat concrete pad or [[downrange]] [[Autonomous spaceport drone ship|floating landing platform]] used with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy—the ITS booster was to be designed to land on a [[Launch mount landing pad|launch mount]] itself, where it may then be refilled with propellant and checked out for follow-on flights.&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt;

=== Spacecraft that operate briefly as upper stages during launch ===

The ITS launch vehicle does not have a dedicated and single-function [[second stage]] in the way most launch vehicles have had.  Instead, the upper stage function of gaining sufficient velocity to place a payload into [[orbit|Earth orbit]] is provided as a relatively short term role by a [[spacecraft]] that has all the requisite systems for long-duration spaceflight.&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt;  This is not a role that most upper stages have had in launch vehicle designs through the 2010s, as typical upper stage on-orbit life is measured in hours.
Previous exceptions to this norm exist, for example the [[Space Shuttle]] orbiter provided part of the boost energy and all of the second stage energy for lofting itself into low-Earth orbit.  Differences also exist: the Space Shuttle expended its propellant tank and primary launch vehicle structure on ascent, whereas the ITS first- and second-stage options are designed to be fully reusable.

In the 2016 design, SpaceX had identified two spacecraft that would also play the upper stage role on each Earth-away launch: the ''interplanetary spaceship''  and the ''ITS tanker''.
Both spacecraft are the same physical external dimensions: {{convert|49.5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on|adj=on}}-long and {{convert|12|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on|adj=on}}-diameter {{convert|17|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}} across at the widest point. Both designs were powered by six vacuum-optimized Raptor engines, each producing {{convert|3.5|MN|lbf|abbr=on}} thrust, and were to have had three lower-expansion-ratio Raptor engines for in-space maneuvering as well as during descent and landing to allow for reuse on future launches.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/&gt;

==== Interplanetary spaceship ====

The '''Interplanetary spaceship'''&lt;!-- Bolded per [[WP:MOS]]/[[WP:MOSBOLD]] as redirected term to this article section --&gt; was a large passenger-carrying [[spacecraft]] design proposed by SpaceX as part of their ITS launch vehicle in September 2016.  The ship would operate as a second-stage of the orbital launch vehicle on Earth-ascents—and would also be the [[Beyond Earth orbit|interplanetary]] [[space transport|transport]] vehicle for both cargo and passengers—&lt;!-- where the second stage is both a traditional second stage—used to accelerate the vehicle to [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]]—and is also a [[space capsule]] capable of supporting long-term transits to interplanetary locations. --&gt; capable of transporting up to {{convert|450|tonne|lbs}} of cargo per trip to Mars following propellant-refill in Earth orbit.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;

[[File:SpaceX-InterplanetarySpaceship-back quarter view-with solar extended (cropped &amp; retouched).jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.15|Back-quarter view of a rendering of the ''interplanetary spaceship'' from engineering drawings, with the [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] extended.]]

In addition to use during maneuvering, descent and landing, the three lower-expansion-ratio Raptor engines were also to have been used for initial ascent from the surface of Mars.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;
In 2016, the first test launch of a spaceship was not expected until 2020 or later, and the first flight of the ITS booster was expected to follow a year or more later.&lt;!-- no explicit mention of tanker schedule in any source; could be earlier (as a "pre-spaceship" SSTO test vehicle) or later than the spaceship and booster --&gt;&lt;ref name=sn20160927&gt;

Early Mars flights—in the mid-2020s or later—were expected to carry mostly equipment and few people.&lt;ref name=dn20121213/&gt;

==== ITS tanker ====

The '''ITS tanker'''&lt;!-- Bolded per [[WP:MOS]]/[[WP:MOSBOLD]] as redirected term to this article section --&gt; is a [[propellant tanker]] variant of the ITS second stage spacecraft. This spacecraft design was to be used exclusively for launch and short-term holding of propellants to be transported to [[low-Earth orbit]].  Once on orbit, a [[proximity operations|rendezvous]] operation was to have been effected with one of the ''interplanetary spaceships'', [[autonomous robot|plumbing connections made]], while a maximum of {{convert|380|tonne|lbs}} of [[liquid methane]] and [[liquid oxygen]] propellants would be transferred in one load to the spaceship.  To fully fuel an ''interplanetary spaceship'' for a long-duration interplanetary flight, it was expected that up to five tankers would be required to launch from Earth, carrying and transferring a total of nearly {{convert|1900|tonne|lbs}} of propellant to fully load the spaceship for the journey.&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/&gt;&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt;

Following completion of the on-orbit propellant offloading, the reusable tanker was to [[atmospheric reentry|reenter]] the [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], land, and be prepared for another tanker flight.&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/&gt;

=== Reusability ===

Both stages were designed by SpaceX to be fully reusable and were to land [[VTVL|vertically,]] using a [[SpaceX reusable launch system development program|set of technologies previously developed by SpaceX and tested in 2013–2016 on a variety of Falcon 9 test vehicles]] as well as [[Falcon 9 first-stage landing tests|actual Falcon 9 launch vehicles]].&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a&gt;
{{cite news |last=Bergin|first=Chris |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/09/spacex-reveals-mars-game-changer-colonization-plan/ |title=SpaceX reveals ITS Mars game changer via colonization plan |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |date=2016-09-27 |accessdate=2016-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, the "fully and rapidly reusable" aspect of the ITS launch vehicle and spacecraft design was the largest factor in the SpaceX analysis for bringing down the currently huge cost of transporting mass to space, in general, and to interplanetary destinations, in particular.  While the transport [[system]] under development in 2016-2017 relied on a combination of [[Interplanetary Transport System#Description|several elements]] to make long-duration [[beyond Earth orbit]] (BEO) spaceflights possible by reducing the cost per ton delivered to Mars, the reusability aspect of the launch and spacecraft vehicles alone was expected by SpaceX to reduce that cost by approximately {{nowrap|2 1/2}} [[orders of magnitude]] over what NASA had previously achieved on similar missions.  Musk stated that this is over half of the total {{nowrap|4 1/2}} orders of magnitude reduction that he believes is needed to enable a sustainable settlement off Earth to emerge.&lt;ref name="spacex-itsvideo201609-09:20"&gt;
{{cite AV media |people=Elon Musk |date=27 September 2016 |title=Making Humans a Multiplanetary Species |trans-title= |medium=video |language= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Uyfqi_TE8 |access-date=10 October 2016 |format= |time=9:20–10:10 |location=IAC67, Guadalajara, Mexico |publisher=SpaceX |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote=''So it is a bit tricky. Because we have to figure out how to improve the cost of the trips to Mars by five million percent ... translates to an improvement of approximately 4 1/2 orders of magnitude. These are the key elements that are needed in order to achieve a 4 1/2 order of magnitude improvement.  Most of the improvement would come from full reusability—somewhere between 2 and 2 1/2 orders of magnitude—and then the other 2 orders of magnitude would come from refilling in orbit, propellant production on Mars, and choosing the right propellant.'' |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/&gt;

=== Launch location ===

When announced in September 2016, the targeted location for initial launches of the ITS launch vehicle was [[LC-39A]], at SpaceX's leased pad at [[Launch pad 39A]] on the [[Florida]] [[space coast|coast]], the same launchpad where [[Apollo 11]] launched in 1969 to the Moon. Subsequent Apollo Missions were also launched from the pad.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;

== Operations concept ==

The [[concept of operations]] for ITS launches envisioned the fully loaded second-stage reaching orbit with only minimal propellant remaining in the ''interplanetary spaceship'' vehicle's tanks.  Then, while the spaceship remained in Earth orbit, three to five cargo second stages—called ''ITS tankers''—would be launched from Earth carrying additional [[liquid methane|methane]] fuel and [[liquid oxygen]] oxidizer to [[proximity operations|rendezvous with]], and [[propellant depot|transfer propellant to]], the outgoing spaceship.  Once refueled, the spaceship was to perform a [[trans-Mars injection]] burn, departing Earth orbit for the interplanetary portion of the journey.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;

== Economic considerations ==

=== Funding ===

The [[New product development|development]] work on the new two-stage launch vehicle design was [[private spaceflight|privately funded]] by SpaceX. The entire project is even possible only as a result of SpaceX multi-faceted approach focusing on the reduction of launch [[cost]]s.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;

The full build-out of the Mars colonialization plans was envisioned by Musk in 2016 to be funded by [[public private partnership|both private and public funds]].  The speed of commercially available Mars transport for both cargo and humans will be driven, in large part, by [[demand (economics)|market demand]] as well as constrained by the [[supply (economics)|technology development and development funding]].

Elon Musk said that there is no expectation of receiving NASA contracts for any of the ITS system work SpaceX was doing. He also indicated that such contracts, if received, would be good.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/SpcPlcyOnline/status/780894498893225984 https://twitter.com/SpcPlcyOnline/status/780894498893225984]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competition for the American super-heavy-lift market ===
In August 2014, media sources noted that the US launch market might have two [[Space launch market competition|competitive launch vehicles]] available in the 2020s to launch payloads of {{convert|100|tonnes|lb}} or more to low Earth orbit.  The [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] is currently developing the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS), a [[super heavy-lift launch vehicle]] designed to propel very large payloads of {{convert|70|to|130|tonnes|lb}} to low Earth orbit.&lt;ref name="nsf20140830"/&gt;&lt;ref name=KSC-SLS-manifest&gt;
{{cite news |title=KSC meeting portrays SLS as scrambling for a manifest plan |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/01/ksc-meeting-sls-scrambling-manifest-plan/ |accessdate=14 January 2016 |date=12 January 2016 |quote=''Also notable – though understandably not referenced at the KSC meeting – is SpaceX’s plan to have its BFR – a reusable booster with the power of two Saturn Vs – already up and running by the 2020s, ahead of MCT (Mars Colonial Transporter) missions.'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Refill-Ink-Kit-Color.jpg|thumb|200px|Color - Inkjet refill kit.]]
[[Image:Refill-Ink-Kit-Black.jpg|thumb|200px|Black - Inkjet refill kit.]]
An '''inkjet refill kit''' is a set of tools and a certain amount of ink used to refill [[ink cartridge]]s.  The specific tools and the amount or type of ink depends on which cartridge the kit is designed for.  The purpose of an inkjet refill kit for consumers is that it offers a low-cost alternative to buying new cartridges.

==Contents==
Typically, a refill kit comes with a cartridge holder, bottles of ink and needles.  The exact tools that come with the kit can vary by manufacturer or by which cartridge the kit is for.  Some tools are found in all kits because they are necessary to refill, but others, like the cartridge holder or a needle to withdraw air from the cartridge, are optional.

The most common refill kits come with either:  bottles of black ink for black refill kits; or one bottle each of [[cyan]], [[magenta]] and yellow for color refill kits; or one bottle each of photo cyan, photo magenta and photo black for photo-color refill kits; or combination of all colors for combo refill kits.

==Refilling process==
{{howto|section|date=December 2011}}
The refill process typically involves the following steps:

* ''Injecting ink'': Depending on the type of cartridge being refilled, ink can either be injected through a hole on top of the cartridge, or directly into the ink chambers after the top has been popped off.  The ink can be injected directly from a bottle (with a needle tip on it) or from a needle filled with ink.  The ink must be slowly injected into the cartridge so as not to cause damage, or overfilling, or overflow to other-color ink reservoirs. (For colors, a label on the cartridge might have three ordered color-dots to indicate the corresponding three ink colors of the reservoir chambers.

: Some refill kits include a final step where a small amount of air is removed from the cartridge in order to restore the ink-fluid balance that was present inside the cartridge before the refilling.

* ''Installing and running'': Once the cartridge is filled, the top is placed back on (if necessary) and the cartridge can be reinstalled in the printer.  Extra ink flowing from the cartridge print-head can be wiped or blotted (for a few minutes).  On some cartridges, the ink has a problem getting to the bottom of the cartridge (especially the colored cartridges), it must be forced to the bottom either by suction through the jet plate or by putting pressure from the top with a syringe to purge the ink through the jet plate very gently.  It might be necessary to run the printer cleaning utilities on the refilled cartridge, in case any excess ink is left over from the refilling process.  A note to the unfamiliar: the capacity of the cartridge of some brands is much much more than the cartridge comes with when new (especially the colored ones), there may be room for 2 or 3 times the ink sold in some "kits" (this can be learned by doing an autopsy on a non-functioning cartridge, also why the ink does not reach the bottom in the case of some colored inks).  In those cases, the needle must be able to reach to within 0.375" from the bottom or closer to be sure that the ink can reach the jets and not just saturate the sponge.  The sponge can in some cases take two or more charges of ink and still not reach the bottom (jets).
* ''Print-head cleaning'':  Sometimes the ink flow might be blocked by dried ink on the ink cartridge print-head.  For color cartridges, typically one ink-color fails to flow due to dried ink.  The dried ink can be cleaned using [[isopropyl alcohol]] (50% or higher) on a swab or folded paper towel rubbed gently three or four times across the print-head.  Another method is to let the cartridge sit overnight in a shallow cup or glass of very warm clean water (not necessarily distilled water).  The water depth required is about .25 or .375";  remove and re-clean as above and try to use.

==Anti-refilling protections used by printer manufacturers==

[[Image:Wiki vb ngeresetEpson.gif|thumb|Resetting an Epson ink cartridge using a resetter tool]]

Many printer manufactures provide their cartridges with chips and/or sensors to prevent refilling. These chips can also serve as a "copy protection," so that the printer does not work with cartridges made by other manufacturers. In such cases, the refilling process must include the bypassing of those anti-refilling protections. (Refill instructions, chip resetters or autoreset chips [the latter are reset each time the printer is switched on] for different cartridge models, and other tools are available on the Internet.)

'''Time-coding of ink cartridges'''

To make more money, some manufacturers provide their ink cartridges with a time chip, so that after a certain period of time or after a certain number of printed pages the ink cartridges no longer work and/or a message appears that they are empty even if they are still almost full. So the user cannot buy several ink cartridges to store them for a longer time, but must regularly buy new ones.

'''Region-coding of printers and ink cartridges'''

For price discrimination, some printer manufacturers (e.g. Canon, Epson, HP, Lexmark, Xerox) give their printers and ink cartridges region codes - similar to DVD region codes -, so that the users can only use printers and ink cartridges from their region and cannot import cheaper ones from another region. The region can be changed several times; then, the printer is "region-locked" like an RPC-2 DVD drive and accepts only cartridges from one certain region. Sometimes the region change must be done by the manufacturer's customer service and cannot be done by the user.
&lt;br /&gt;
Xerox printers are shipped with neutral "factory" ink sticks with no region coding. Upon the installation of the first new ink stick after these factory sticks, the machine will set a region code based on the installed ink stick and will only accept ink sticks for that region from that point forward. "Officially, " only three starter ink sticks per color can be used; then, the printer will no longer accept them and will want region-coded ink sticks to be inserted, but there are workarounds for that problem.

When moving to a new region, it seems a good idea to store empty cartridges from the old region (or to re-use the region-free Xerox factory ink sticks) and to refill them with ink from the new region. However, they usually also have chips and sensors to prevent refilling (such as the "time chips" mentioned above).
	
Some manufacturers of region-coded printers also offer region-free printers specially designed for travelers, but, generally, ''the best solution seems to be to avoid region-coded printers.''

'''Integration of the print-head in the cartridge'''

Some manufacturers install the print-head not in the printer, but integrate it in the cartridge. This makes it more difficult or even illegal (because of patent laws) for other manufacturers to rebuild cartridges, and just refilling the cartridge (including cleaning the print-head and resetting or disabling chips/sensors, if necessary) is sometimes not sufficient, because one cannot print anymore once the print-head no longer works.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
{{original research|section|date=April 2013}}
The main benefit of using a refill kit is the claimed cost savings. Environmental benefit is also claimed, as the process reuses a cartridge that would have otherwise been thrown away after one use.

The downside to refill is the time associated with it and the unpredictability.  Refilling a cartridge can take 10–15 minutes for those unfamiliar with the process, and some may prefer buying a new cartridge to the effort it takes to refill.  Also, ink cartridges usually last for 4-5 refills, but there are those that can only be refilled one time before they are worn out.

The biggest perceived downside to refilling is the mess associated with it.  Many consumers shy away from refilling either based on past experiences or stories they have heard.  Many of the unsuccessful refill kits of the past were so-called "universal" kits, meaning they were designed for use with multiple cartridges.  Because all manufacturers use different types of ink, and because different cartridge designs require different refilling processes, these universal kits had a high failure rate.  Today these kits are harder to find, as refill kits made for specific cartridges have become more the norm, but perception that all refill kits are messy still remains.

The main reason for the decline in refill kits is the emergence of large chains of ink stores that offer a refill process.  This is similar to the evolution of the automobile oil change. Just as cars became too complex for the average driver to change oil, the new cartridges have also become too complex for the average consumer to do it by themselves.

Inkjet refill kits are available in different sizes and with different grades of ink.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8566">While a `type` is a description of a specific set of values, a `kind` is a descripton of a specific quantity of `types` as in 1, 2, 3, etc. Some `type` constructors, such as a `Monad`, require only one `type` to be able to fully construct a new `type` while others may require two or three `types` to completely construct/describe their `type`. Still, another `type` constuctor may return a `type` constructor that requires even more `types`. Note, that the function `type` constructor, `-&gt;`, has a `kind` of 2 and is shown as, `(* -&gt; *)`, where `*` represents a `kind`. The idea of kinds generalizes the notion of generics.

In the area of [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]] known as [[type theory]], a '''kind''' is the type of a [[type constructor]] or, less commonly, the type of a [[higher-order type operator]]. A kind system is essentially a [[simply typed lambda calculus]] "one level up", endowed with a primitive type, denoted &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; and called "type", which is the kind of any [[data type]] which does not need any [[parametric polymorphism|type parameters]].

A kind is sometimes confusingly described as the "type of a [[data type|(data) type]]", but it is actually more of an [[arity]] specifier. Syntactically, it is natural to consider polymorphic types to be type constructors, thus non-polymorphic types to be [[nullary]] type constructors. But all nullary constructors, thus all monomorphic types, have the same, simplest kind; namely &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;.

Since higher-order type operators are uncommon in [[programming language]]s, in most programming practice, kinds are used to distinguish between data types and the types of constructors which are used to implement [[parametric polymorphism]]. Kinds appear, either explicitly or implicitly, in languages whose type systems account for parametric polymorphism in a programatically accessible way, such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]&lt;!-- have to check Scala, but I bet it allows parametric polymorphism --&gt;.&lt;ref name="higherkinds"&gt;[https://adriaanm.github.com/files/higher.pdf Generics of a Higher Kind]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

* &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, pronounced "type", is the kind of all [[data type]]s seen as [[nullary]] type constructors, and also called proper types in this context. This normally includes function types in [[functional programming language]]s.
* &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; is the kind of a [[unary function|unary]] [[type constructor]], e.g. of a [[list type]] constructor.
* &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow * \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; is the kind of a [[wiktionary:binary|binary]] type constructor (via [[currying]]), e.g. of a [[pair type]] constructor, and also that of a [[function type]] constructor (not to be confused with the result of its application, which itself is a function type, thus of kind &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;(* \rightarrow *) \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; is the kind of a higher-order type operator from unary type constructors to proper types.&lt;ref&gt; Pierce (2002), chapter 32&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kinds in Haskell ==
(''Note'': Haskell documentation uses the same arrow for both function types and kinds.)

[[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]'s kind system&lt;ref name="haskell98"&gt;[http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#sect4.1.1 Kinds - The Haskell 98 Report]&lt;/ref&gt; has just two rules:{{Vague|date=August 2009}}&lt;!--does this mean it prohibits higher order type operators? I can't tell from the report. --&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, pronounced "type" is the kind of all [[data type]]s.
* &lt;math&gt;k_1 \rightarrow k_2&lt;/math&gt; is the kind of a [[unary function|unary]] [[type constructor]], which takes a type of kind &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; and produces a type of kind &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;.

An inhabited type (as proper types are called in Haskell) is a type which has values. For instance, ignoring [[type class]]es which complicate the picture, &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; is a value of type &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;[1, 2, 3]&lt;/code&gt; is a value of type &lt;code&gt;[Int]&lt;/code&gt; (list of Ints). Therefore, &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[Int]&lt;/code&gt; have kind &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, but so does any function type, for instance &lt;code&gt;Int -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; or even &lt;code&gt;Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;.

A type constructor takes one or more type arguments, and produces a data type when enough arguments are supplied, i.e. it supports [[partial application]] thanks to currying.&lt;ref name=haskell-2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 4 Declarations and Binding|url=http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch4.html#x10-65017x3|work=Haskell 2010 Language Report|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miran|first=Lipovača|title=Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!|url=http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses|work=Making Our Own Types and Typeclasses|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is how Haskell achieves parametric types. For instance, the type &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; (list) is a type constructor - it takes a single argument to specify the type of the elements of the list. Hence, &lt;code&gt;[Int]&lt;/code&gt; (list of Ints), &lt;code&gt;[Float]&lt;/code&gt; (list of Floats) and even &lt;code&gt;[&amp;#91;Int&amp;#93;]&lt;/code&gt; (list of lists of Ints) are valid applications of the &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; type constructor. Therefore, &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; is a type of kind &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, applying it to &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; results in &lt;code&gt;[Int]&lt;/code&gt;, of kind &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;. The 2-[[tuple]] constructor &lt;code&gt;(,)&lt;/code&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow * \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt;, the 3-tuple constructor &lt;code&gt;(,,)&lt;/code&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow * \rightarrow * \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; and so on.
&lt;!-- needs rewriting to say what it really wants to  say, that is how kind inference is performed, but note that no kind polymorphism is allowed, so it's not quite the same.
The way kinds govern types is analogous to the way types govern values. If an expression &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;t_1 \to t_2&lt;/math&gt; (that is, it is a function which accepts a type &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; and produces a type &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;, then the result of the function application &lt;math&gt;f \ x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly if an expression &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;k_1 \rightarrow k_2&lt;/math&gt;, and type &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt;, then the result of the type application &lt;math&gt;t_1 \ t_2&lt;/math&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;. --&gt;

=== Kind inference ===

Standard Haskell does not allow [[polymorphic kind]]s. This is in contrast to [[parametric polymorphism]] on types, which is supported in Haskell.  For instance, in the following example:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
data Tree z  = Leaf | Fork (Tree z) (Tree z)
&lt;/source&gt;

the kind of &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; could be anything, including &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, but also &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; etc. Haskell by default will always infer kinds to be &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, unless the type explicitly indicates otherwise (see below). Therefore the type checker will reject the following use of &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
type FunnyTree = Tree []     -- invalid
&lt;/source&gt;

because the kind of &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; does not match the expected kind for &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;, which is always &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;.

Higher-order type operators are allowed however. For instance:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
data App unt z = Z (unt z)
&lt;/source&gt;

has kind &lt;math&gt;(* \rightarrow *) \rightarrow * \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;code&gt;unt&lt;/code&gt; is expected to be a unary data constructor, which gets applied to its argument, which must be a type, and returns another type.

[[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]] has the extension &lt;code&gt;PolyKinds&lt;/code&gt;, which, together with &lt;code&gt;KindSignatures&lt;/code&gt;, allows polymorphic kinds. For example:
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
data Tree (z :: k) = Leaf | Fork (Tree z) (Tree z)
type FunnyTree = Tree []     -- OK
&lt;/source&gt;

In GHC 8.0.1, types and kinds can merged using the experimental compiler option &lt;code&gt;-XTypeInType&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#ghc-flag--XTypeInType&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lange model''' (or '''Lange–Lerner theorem''') is a [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic]] model for a hypothetical socialist economy based on public ownership of the [[means of production]] and a trial-and-error approach to determining output targets and achieving [[economic equilibrium]] and [[Pareto efficiency]]. In this model, the state owns non-labor factors of production, and markets allocate final goods and consumer goods. The Lange model states that if all production is performed by a public body such as the state, and there is a functioning price mechanism, this economy will be Pareto-efficient, like a hypothetical [[market economy]] under [[perfect competition]]. Unlike models of capitalism, the Lange model is based on direct allocation, by directing enterprise managers to set price equal to [[marginal cost]] in order to achieve Pareto efficiency. By contrast, in a capitalist economy managers are instructed to maximize profits for private owners, while competitive pressures are relied on to indirectly lower the price to equal marginal cost.

This model was first proposed by [[Oskar R. Lange]] in 1936 during the [[socialist calculation debate]], and was expanded by economists like H. D. Dickinson, [[Abba P. Lerner]] and [[Fred M. Taylor]]. Although Lange and Lerner called it "[[market socialism]]", the Lange model is a form of planned economy where a central planning board allocates investment and capital goods, while markets allocate labor and consumer goods. The planning board simulates a market in capital goods by a trial-and-error process first elaborated by [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Léon Walras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03085149800000027| title = Socialism against markets? A critique of two recent proposals| journal = Economy and Society| volume = 27| issue = 4| pages = 407–433| year = 1998| last1 = Hodgson | first1 = G. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lange model has never been implemented anywhere, not even in Oskar Lange's home country, [[Poland]], where [[Soviet-type economic planning]] was imposed after World War II, precluding experimentation with Lange-style economy.&lt;ref name="Post-Lange Socialism: An Evaluation of Profit-Oriented Proposals, 1995"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yunker | first1 = James A. | year = 1995 | title = Post-Lange Market Socialism: An Evaluation of Profit-Oriented Proposals | journal = Journal of Economic Issues | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 683–717 | publisher =  | jstor = 4226984 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = | doi=10.1080/00213624.1995.11505705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parallels might be drawn with the [[New Economic Mechanism]] or so-called [[Goulash Communism]] in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] under [[János Kádár|Kádár]], although this was not a pure Lange-model system.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Thomas. "The Lessons of Limited Market-Oriented Reform" (1991), The Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 5, No. 4 (Autumn, 1991), pp. 45-58&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The model is sometimes called the "Lange–Lerner" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bator|first=Francis M.|title=The Anatomy of Market Failure|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date=August 1958|volume=72|issue=3|pages=351–379|jstor=1882231|doi=10.2307/1882231}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abba Lerner]] wrote a series of articles that greatly influenced Lange's thinking. For example, Lerner (1938) caused Lange to re-write his 1936 and 1937 articles on [[market socialism]], before they were re-published as chapters in a 1938 book. Lerner (1938) influenced Lange's thinking on [[social dividend]] payments. Lerner (1944) also argued that investment in the Lange model would inevitably be politicized.

The Lange model was developed in response to [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s [[criticisms of socialism]] during the [[socialist calculation debate]]. The critics argued that any body that owns and consolidates a society's means of production cannot acquire the information needed to calculate general equilibrium prices, and that market-determined prices were essential for the rational allocation of producer goods. The Lange model contains principles proposed by neoclassical economists [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Léon Walras]]. Lange's theory emphasizes the idea of Pareto efficiency: a situation is Pareto-efficient if there is no way to rearrange things to make any individual better off without making anyone worse off. To achieve Pareto efficiency, a set of conditions must be formulated in stages. This idea of deriving conditions to ensure that consumer preferences are in balance with the maximum amount of goods and services produced is emphasized by Walras. The theorem indicates that a socialist economy based on public ownership could achieve one of the principal economic benefits of capitalism - a rational price system - and was an important theoretical force behind the development of the concept of [[market socialism]].

== Basic principles ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
[[File:Lange_model_diagram.svg|alt=|thumb|367x367px|A chart to show how the model would hypothetically function.]]
{{Economics sidebar}}
The Lange model suggests three levels of decision-making. The lowest level contains firms and households, the intermediate level contains industrial ministries, and the highest level is the central planning board. The board sets the initial price of consumer goods arbitrarily and informs the producing firms of these prices.  The state-owned firms then produce at the level of output where [[marginal cost]] equals price, P = MC, so as to minimize the cost of production. At the intermediate level, industrial ministries determine the sectoral expansion of industry.  Households decide how to allocate income and how much labor to supply by choosing between work and leisure.

=== Institutions ===
The key institutions of the Lange model include the central planning board (CPB), industrial ministries for each economic sector, and state enterprises [[Workplace democracy|managed democratically]] by their employees.

=== Trial-and-error price adjustments ===
Because prices are set by the central planning board "artificially" aiming to achieve planned growth objectives, it is unlikely that supply and demand will be in equilibrium at first. To produce the correct amount of goods and services, the Lange model suggests a trial-and-error method. If there is a surplus of a particular good, the central planning board lowers the price of that good. Conversely, if there is a shortage of a good, the board raises the price. This process of price adjustments takes place until equilibrium between supply and demand is achieved.

=== Central planning board ===
The central planning board (CPB) has three major functions in the Lange model: First it instructs firms to set price to equal marginal cost, secondly it adjusts prices to attain market-clearing prices for goods and services, and finally, it reinvests the economic profit derived from state enterprises into the economy based on a target rate of growth. The central planning board also distributes social dividends to the population.

=== Social dividend ===
Apart from setting prices, the central planning board allocates [[social dividend]]s. Because all non-labor factors of production are publicly owned, the rents and profits of these resources belong to the public. The profits would be used to finance a social dividend scheme based on the individuals' share in the income derived from the socially owned capital and natural resources, providing a complimentary source of income for workers alongside their salaries and wages.&lt;ref name="On the Economic Theory of Socialism, 1936"&gt;''On the Economic Theory of Socialism'', by Lange, Oskar. 1936. The Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 4, No. 1: "It seems, therefore, convenient to regard the income of consumers as being composed of two parts: one part being the receipts for the labour services performed and the other part being a social dividend constituting the individual's share in the income derived from the capital and the natural resources owned by society."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
The Lange economic model has a number of theoretical advantages. One advantage is public control over investment. The rate of economic growth would be largely state-determined and a major determinant would be investment ratio.

Another advantage argued by Lange was that [[externalities]] could be better accounted for, thanks to the state's ability to manipulate resource prices.  Because the state controls all firms, they could easily factor the cost of an externality into the price of a certain resource.  Because decisions are made at higher rather than lower levels, it is argued that these decisions are less likely to have undesirable environmental consequences.

Furthermore, because the state uses [[marginal cost pricing]] and determines entry, Langean socialism can avoid monopolies and the accompanying lack of [[allocative efficiency]] and [[x-inefficiency|x-efficiency]].

The model claims to solve another main criticism of [[capitalism]].  Lange believed that his model would reduce cyclical instability because the state would control savings and investment, consequently eliminating a major source of inefficiency, inequality and social instability that arises from violent cyclical shifts under capitalism.

== Criticisms ==
[[Milton Friedman]] criticized the Lange model on methodological grounds. According to Friedman, the model rested on 'models of imaginary worlds' rather than 'generalizations about the real world', making the claims of the model immune to falsification.  He also criticized the model on logical grounds, by pointing out that any system which posits state ownership of enterprise requires the continuous intervention by force from the state: any time an individual started a private enterprise, the state must either shut it down or seize it, or use force to deter individuals from starting private enterprises in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Friedman, 'Lange on Price Flexibility and Employment', ''Essays in Positive Economics''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2017}}

[[Misogyny]] can occur in [[horror film]]s when there is a degrading representation of women. This is found particularly in [[slasher film]]s, where there is often gendered specific violence towards women.&lt;ref name=King /&gt; Female characters experience violence and brutality at the hands of male antagonists far more often than male characters in these films. Female characters are likely to experience sexual violence, particularly in the [[Rape and revenge film|rape-and-revenge]] subgenre. 
==Genres==
===Slasher films===
{{main|Slasher film}}Female and male characters who have been sexually involved die in the slasher genre. Research has been unable to show if female characters are killed more often in an explicitly sexual way than male characters.&lt;ref name=Weaver&gt;{{cite journal|first=James B. III|last=Weaver|title=Are `Slasher' Horror Films Sexually Violent?

====Teen slasher films====
Teen slasher films feature teen [[protagonist]]s who portray the [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] American family. Films such as ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) and ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' (1976), show the relationship between society and horror films. Pat Gill states that, "teen slasher films both resolutely mock and yearn for the middle-class [[American dream]], the promised comfort and contentment of a loving, supportive [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] family."  These films portray parents who are incapable of helping their children when the latter are in dire need of help. [[Psychologist]]s have concluded that an "ethical shift in the meaning and value of family responsibility" has occurred, which is characterized by a change from an obligation to others towards to a focus on oneself. According to some research, divorce is the main reason for this shift, and it has been suggested that horror films tend to portray what is going on in society. According to Gill,  this change in meaning and values explains why teenagers in horror films are left to fend for themselves and the boundaries of their homes have become "entirely permeable to evil".&lt;ref name=Gill&gt;Gill, Pat. "The Monstrous Years: Teens, Slasher Films, And The Family." Journal of Film &amp; Video54.4 (2002): 16-30. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. Web. 11 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture films===
Some critics suggest that the torture represented in the [[Splatter film|torture horror]] genre reflects contemporary U.S. society. The methods of torture in these films are adapted from the discussion of terrorism.&lt;ref name=Wester&gt;{{cite journal|first=Maisha|last=Wester|title=Torture Porn And Uneasy Feminisms: Re-Thinking (Wo)Men In Eli Roth's Hostel Films|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10509201003719258|journal=[[Quarterly Review Of Film &amp; Video]]|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=Abingdon, England|volume=29|issue=5|date=2012|pages=387-400|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the "[[War on Terror]]", the film industry had trouble distinguishing between the characters of "torturer, victim, villain, and hero." Writers and directors of horror films had difficulty allowing their torturers and villains to survive after doing such heinous acts. Mashia Wester sees films such as ''[[The Descent]]'', ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'', and ''[[High Tension]]'' as depicting "average Americans both as tortured victim and torturing hero."&lt;ref name=Wester /&gt; The heroes within these torture films do not actively torture but contribute to their own and others' suffering.

[[Eli Roth]], the creator of the [[Hostel (2005 film)|''Hostel'']] films, taps into an "undercurrent of anxiety about the place of gendered bodies in relation to torture as well as the connection between gender equality, torture, global capitalist venture, and the passive American consumer."&lt;ref name=Wester /&gt; Maisha Wester's states in her article, "Torture Porn And Uneasy Feminisms: Re-Thinking (Wo)Men in Eli Roth's Hostel Films", that the popularity of the ''Hostel'' films makes the questioning of gendered dominance "both elusive and inescapable in the face of capitalism since, within such a system, we are all commodifiable and consuming bodies."&lt;ref name=Wester /&gt;

==Gender==
The misogynistic treatment of women in horror films can be associated with the fear of the [[Abjection|abject]].&lt;ref name=Kilker&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert|last=Kilker|title=All Roads Lead To The Abject: The Monstrous Feminine And Gender Boundaries In Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining|journal=[[Literature Film Quarterly]]|publisher=[[Salisbury University]]|location=Salisbury, Maryland|volume=34|issue=1|date=2006|pages=54-63|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julia Kristeva]] explains the abject to be "something rejected from which one does not part, from which one does not protect oneself as from an object. Imaginary uncanniness and real threat, it beckons to us and ends up engulfing us." Kristeva is stating that we are horrified by the abject because "it is something that disgusts us, yet comes from us or from which we come."&lt;ref name=Kristeva&gt;{{cite book|first=Julia|last=Kristeva|title=[[Powers of Horror|Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection]]|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=New York City|date=1980|ISBN=978-0231053471}}&lt;/ref&gt; We are brought up being taught what we should see with disgust; therefore we must conceal it in shame. Horror films use the female body as a form of an abject. The bodily fluid, [[blood]], gets related to the period and [[birth]]ing only the female body can perform. This then constitutes motherhood as something society is taught to be disgusted with feeding into this patriarchal world.&lt;ref name=Kilker /&gt;

In the article, ''Monster Pains: Masochism, Menstruation, and Identification in the Horror Film'' by Aviva Briefel, she states that there are two identifications of gendered modes for monstrous suffering: masochism and menstruation. Masochism is central to the identification of male monsters "who initiate their sadistic rampages with acts of self-mutilation." However, if we look at the female monster we will see that she does not commit acts of self-mutilation out of pleasure but instead "commit acts of violence out of revenge for earlier abuse by parents, partners, rapists, and other offenders." Female monsters will engage in masochistic acts when she is coerced or is trying to terminate her monstrosity. Briefel shows examples of these certain masochistic acts by female monsters with films like ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' (1976), ''[[The Exorcist]]'' (1973), ''[[Stigmata (film)|Stigmata]]'' (1999), ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'' (1983), and ''[[Alien 3]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name=Briefel /&gt;

===Final girl===
{{main|Final girl}}
The slasher film was the first genre that allowed gender norms to take a different path. The role of the [[final girl]] confused audiences with the portrayal of a female being a violent hero.&lt;ref name=King&gt;{{cite journal|first=Neal|last=King|title=Boy Jokes: Content Analysis Of Hollywood Misogyny In Mean Girl And Slasher Movies|journal=Conference Papers|publisher=[[International Communication Association]]|location=Sheraton, New York|date=2005|pages=1-20|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was finally a possibility that the heroine who defeats the [[monster]] is a female and is categorized as the final girl. The final girl is the "first character to sense something amiss and the only one to deduce from the accumulating evidence the pattern and extent of threat; the only one, in other words, whose perspective approaches our own privileged understanding of the situation."&lt;ref name=Clover2 /&gt; The only way the final girl is able to kill or escape the monster is by taking on male characteristics. However, [[Carol J. Clover]] cautions audiences against seeing "final girls" as products of [[feminism]]. Final girls are still seen like the other women who have been killed after taking part in sexual activities by being a part of "the chase". Clover concludes that the final girl is "an agreed upon fiction [for] male-viewers' use of her as a vehicle for his own [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] fantasies."&lt;ref name=Clover2&gt;{{cite book|first=Carol J.|last=Clover|authorlink=Carol J. Clover|title=Men, Women and Chain Saws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, New Jersey|date=1992|ISBN=978-0691166292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final girl is one of the most commonly seen tropes in horror films. The final girl is always female, usually a virgin and according to Carol J. Clover, who first identified this trope in 1992, she is typically seen as "the embodiment of what a woman should be." She does not smoke, drink or engage in other illicit behavior though most, if not all, other characters in the film do. She is the lone survivor of the slasher villain, and often bests him by taking on masculine characteristics and engaging in her own form of brutality to kill or escape the antagonist in the end. Clover notes that the final girl is almost always brunette, modestly dressed and seemingly naive in comparison to her friends and other film characters.

===Monster===
[[Carol J. Clover|Carol Clover]] states that the monster in horror films possesses [[Emasculation|emasculated]] rage that portrays the male idea of the monstrous female identity.&lt;ref name=Clover&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clover|first1=Carol J.|title=In The Dread of Difference: Gender and the Horror Film|date=1996|publisher=Univ. of Texas Press|location=Austin, Texas|pages=66–113|edition=Grant, Barry Keith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wester states that the hero and the monster have blurred lines making their characteristics very similar. Both the hero and the monster are dependent on the female body whilst taking part of the patriarchal world and degrading women.&lt;ref name=Wester /&gt; The monsters in horror films try to hide their sexual frustration by masking their identity and human self. The mask allows the monster to kill and release the tension from his sexual [[Psychological repression|repression]].&lt;ref name=Huddleston&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jason|last=Huddleston|title=Unmasking The Monster: Hiding And Revealing Male Sexuality In John Carpenter's Halloween|journal=[[Journal of Visual Literacy]]|publisher=International Visual Literacy Association|location=London, England|volume=25|issue=2|date=2005|pages=219-236|accessdate=February 11, 2015|doi=10.1080/23796529.2005.11674626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The female monster====
Shelley Stamp Lindsey states "''Carrie'' is not about liberation from sexual repression, but about the failure of repression to contain the monstrous feminine". Audiences are not supposed to identify with [[Carrie White]] whilst she becomes the monster, instead they are supposed to be scared of her ability and destructive potential. ''Carrie'' is purposely portrayed in this manner because she demonstrates what happens when women gain power and are no longer repressed. ''Carrie'' ultimately tells its audience that they must live as a [[patriarchal]] world and if they do not then this is what will come of it.&lt;ref name=Stamp&gt;{{cite book|first=Shelley Stamp|last=Lindsey|chapter=Horror, Femininity, and Carrie's Monstrous Puberty|title=The Dread of Difference: Gender and the Horror Film|editor-first=Barry Keith|editor-last=Grant|editorlink=Barry Keith Grant|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, Texas|date=1996|ISBN=978-0292772458|pages=279-95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aviva Briefel states that [[menstruation]] is the start of monstrosity. Once a girl has reached puberty she is seen to be monstrous. Horror films feed into the female monsters identity through her menstruation. This then states that having your period makes you weaker. The overall objective in Briefel's article, "Monster Pains: Masochism, Menstruation, and Identification in the Horror Film", is that the female monster is unable to control her emotions when pain occurs, whereas male monsters are unable to feel pain.&lt;ref name=Briefel /&gt;

[[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' reiterates these stereotypes in present-day filmmaking, styling the major female character, Daisy Domergue ([[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]), as a blood-soaked twin of Carrie,&lt;ref name="Peers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/elaborately-justified-misogyny-the-hateful-eight-and-daisy-domergue-53046 |title='Elaborately justified misogyny': The Hateful Eight and Daisy Domergue |last=Peers |first=Juliette  |date=January 24, 2016 |website=The Conversation |publisher=[[The Conversation]] US |access-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as the glutinous slimy monster of ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]''. Daisy is imaged arbitrarily as a monstrous force, rather than being human. There has been much debate about the conservative nature of this symbolism and the openly negative attitude to women in ''The Hateful Eight''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Laura|last=Bogart |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/hipster-misogyny-the-betrayal-of-the-hateful-eight |title=Hipster Misogyny: The Betrayal of "The Hateful Eight" |date=January 18, 2016 |website=RogerEbert.com |publisher=Ebert Digital |access-date=5 March 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvey Weinstein]] and others have vigorously defended the filmmaker from these charges,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Kristopher|last=Tapley|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/in-contention/hateful-eight-misogyny-quentin-tarantino-harvey-weinstein-1201667868/|title=Claims of 'Hateful Eight' Misogyny 'Fishing for Stupidity,' Harvey Weinstein Says|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|language=en-US|date=December 26, 2015|access-date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; given that the film has received mixed reception and has not matched the commercial success of Tarantino's previous titles, whilst discussion about the treatment of Daisy has opened up criticism of the film that was unforeseen by both producers and director. Though her portrayal as "Female Monster" is no doubt deserved due to her committing multiple acts of murder both during and before the film's story, turning her eventual death at the hands of Warren and Mannix - two men - into well-deserved punishment.

====The repressive patriarch====
In every horror film the repressive patriarchal form of a monster is either "symbolically castrated, pathetically lacking...or he is overly endowed and potent". The real sexual interest that occurs in horror films comes from the monster. "The monster's power is one of sexual difference from the normal male. In this difference he is remarkably like the woman in the eyes of the traumatized male: a biological freak with impossible and threatening appetites that suggest a frightening potency precisely where the normal male would perceive a lack."&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

Men only stay on the screen long enough to show their incompetence, unless they are seen to be a true form of patriarchy.&lt;ref name=Foster&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Gwendolyn|last1=Foster|title=Men, Women, and Chain Saws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film by Carol J. Clover (review)|journal=[[Prairie Schooner]]|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|volume=69|issue=2|date=Summer 1995|pages=156-161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repressive patriarch is often dressed as a female and because he does not exemplify patriarchy at its finest, the final girl is his "[[homoerotic]] stand-in".&lt;ref name=Clover2 /&gt;

The "masochistic monster" revels in acts of self-mutilation before the audience sees the harming of others being done. Briefel looks at films like ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (1931), ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' (1986), ''[[Hellraiser]]'' series, ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984 film)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984), and ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'' (1991). All these horror films show examples of masochistic monsters that take pleasure in the pain they inflict on themselves; it is something they must endure to be monstrous.&lt;ref name=Briefel /&gt;

==Sexuality==
The horror film emphasizes the idea of female sexuality being something that needs to be punished or come with negative consequences. It shows that once a woman acts in a sexual way she will be killed. The American fantasy of women continuously being sexualized is completely taken away in horror films. Once a woman is related to sex, her sexuality is punished.&lt;ref name=Rieser&gt;{{cite journal|first=Klaus|last=Rieser|title=Masculinity and Monstrosity: Characterization and Identification in the Slasher Film|journal=
Men and Masculinities|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|volume=3|number=4|date=April 1, 2001|pages=370-92|doi=10.1177/1097184X01003004002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus Reiser argues, "It is not so much the girls' sexuality per se...but the fact that they have sex with other boys". Sex is considered to be a masculine trait because it is a form of power over someone, and if a woman tries to take control of this power, she will instantly be punished. Her sexual freedom is not within gender-norms, and the [[patriarchal]] society does not accept it.&lt;ref name="Gendered Society Reader"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Michael S.|last1=Kimmel|first2=Amy|last2=Aronson|title=The Gendered Society Reader|edition=3|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York City|date=2008|ISBN=978-0199927494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only "male domination is natural and follows inevitable from evolutionary...or social pressures".&lt;ref name=McIntosh&gt;{{cite book|first=Peggy|last=McIntosh|chapter=White Privilege and Male Privilege|title=Race, Class, and Gender: An Anthology|editor1-first=Margaret|editor1-last=Anderson|editor2-first=Patricia|editor2-last=Hill Collins|date=1998|publisher=[[Wadsworth Publishing Company]]|location=San Francisco, California|ISBN=978-0534528799|pages=76-87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Chase===
The Chase often consists of a sexualized and degraded woman running for her life as an assailant hunts her down and kills her, unless she is termed the "[[final girl]]". Often, The Chase will feature the woman in various states of undress and lecherous camerawork that focuses on her body before she is killed in an attempt to mix sex and violence. Female victims in slasher films are shown to be in a state of fear five times as long as males, specifically occurring during "the chase".&lt;ref name=Molitor&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Fred|last1=Molitor|first2=Barry S.|last2=Sapolsky|title=Sex, Violence, and Victimization in Slasher Films|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=Abingdon, England|volume=37|number=2|date=Spring 1993|pages=233-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phallic weapons===
A phallic weapon, such as a sword or gun, takes on masculine characteristics, even in the hands of a monster, or a woman.

===Mystical pregnancy===
Attaching even further onto the fear of women's bodies, there are multiple cases of female bodies become mere vessel for the monster. A female character is violated and is mystically inseminated, and then endures an excoriating pregnancy or an almost non-existent one, passing without any repercussion. The child is then either a monster that must be killed, or is taken away from the character presently. This trope reduces a women down to the biological, and degrades the emotional and physically complex aspects of bearing and giving birth to a child.&lt;ref name = "Mystical pregnancy"&gt;#5 The Mystical Pregnancy (Tropes vs. Women). Dir. Anita Sarkeessian. Perf. Anita Sarkeessian. Youtube, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The women often have no say in what happens with the baby or even with their own bodies, becoming little more than an object. In horror films such as ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), Rosemary spends the whole film being told what to feel about her pregnancy by her husband and others in the apartment complex. She never gets a say in the subject of her baby, even after it is revealed to be the spawn of [[Satan]]. She remains the vessel for others to take advantage of throughout the film.

==Audience==
The audience first identifies with the monster until there is a shift in point-of-view camera narration, and allows identification with the final girl once the monster is after her.&lt;ref name=Foster /&gt; The audience relates only with [[masculinity]] and disdains  [[femininity]].&lt;ref name=Clover /&gt; Horror films resemble a mirrored object. They gaze back at the audiences' who are unsuccessful in hiding their own sexual desires.&lt;ref name=Huddleston /&gt;

Aviva Briefel believes that pain is central to the audiences understanding of horror films. It is "the monster's pain that determines audience positioning in the horror film." "By gendering the monster's pain, the horror genre prevents the audience from losing control of its own."&lt;ref name=Briefel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briefel|first1=Aviva|title=Film Quarterly|journal=Monster Pains: Masochism, Menstruation, and Identification in the Horror Film|date=2005|volume=58|pages=16–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male===
Scholars such as [[Laura Mulvey|Mulvey]], [[Carol J. Clover|Clover]], and Creed have argued that we live in patriarchal society, where men dictate the rules and women have to abide by them. Clover looks at the notion that men might "elect to betray their sex and identify with screen females."&lt;ref name=Clover2 /&gt; In slasher films, male characters are often killed quickly and easily leaving the audience to resonate with the strong female character left to kill the monster.&lt;ref name=Foster /&gt; Clover seeks to suggest that masochistic impulses is seen within the male spectator who finds a "vicarious stake in" the "fear and pain" the final girl endures by the monster's torturous actions.&lt;ref name=Briefel /&gt;

====The male gaze====
The "[[Gaze|male gaze]]," a term coined by [[Laura Mulvey]] in "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema", describes the depiction of female characters in a sexualized, de-humanizing manner. Mulvey states that, because the media depict women as they are observed through the male gaze, women tend to take on this male perspective. According to this theory, women largely appear on screen for men's erotic pleasure.&lt;ref name=Mulvey&gt;{{cite book|first=Laura|last=Mulvey|chapter=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema |url=http://www.composingdigitalmedia.org/f15_mca/mca_reads/mulvey.pdf|title=Film Theory and Criticism: Introductory Readings|editor1-first=Leo|editor1-last=Braudy|editor2-first=Marshall|editor2-last=Cohen|date=1999 |ISBN=978-0195365627| pages=833-44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female===
Linda Williams suggests it is supposedly honorable for males to gaze upon the terror shown on a movie screen while females hide, avoiding these screen images. She also suggests women have the right to feel as if they do not belong since they are shown as powerless "in the face of rape, mutilation and murder".&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt; As Mulvey argues, the female character "exists only to be looked at."&lt;ref name=Mulvey /&gt; When female audiences gaze upon the screen and when the women on the screen are involved in the gaze, they see "a distorted reflection of" their own image. "The monster is thus a particularly insidious form of the many mirrors patriarchal structure of seeing hold up to the woman." Linda William believes that the woman's gaze is "so threatening to male power, it is violently punished."&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

====The female gaze====
Mary Ann Doane suggests that a woman can only actively participate in the gaze when it is "simultaneous with her own victimization." The woman's gaze is turned into "masochistic fantasy."&lt;ref name=Doane&gt;"Misrecognition and Identity," Ciné-Tracts, vol. 3, no. 3 (Fall 1980), pp. 25–31.&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as the woman feels as if she has power and tries to act on it, she is punished. In "When The Woman Looks", Linda Williams analyzes the terrified gaze a woman encounters when she looks at "the horrible body of the monster." In that very moment, as the monster and the woman gaze upon one another, there is recognition of "similar status within patriarchal structures of seeing." What the woman gazes at in horror is always first seen by the audience and then, seconds later, by the woman on the screen. This sequence "ensures the voyeur's pleasure of looking" and punishes the woman by "the horror that her look reveals". The monster and the woman's gazes are similar. There is not "much difference between an object of desire and an object of horror as far as the male look is concerned." Williams is stating that it isn't an expression of sexual desire that is formed between the monster and the girl but instead "a flash of sympathetic identification."&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;[http://www.northernhighlands.org/cms/lib5/nj01000179/centricity/domain/92/week3-williams-womanlooks.pdf Williams, Linda. ''When The Woman Looks'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race-based sexism==
{{see also|Racism in horror films}}
While misogyny abounds in horror films, so too does a sexism rooted in the colonial traditions of North America. Women in general have poor representation in the American film industry, but its women from minorities who suffer the most, being both nearly non-existent and appropriated for the sake of furthering the plot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Casey|last=Cipriani|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sorry-ladies-study-on-women-in-film-and-television-confirms-the-worst-20150210|title=Sorry, Ladies: Study on Women in Film and Television Confirms The Worst|magazine=[[IndieWire]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=February 10, 2015|accessdate=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the case of horror cinema. This deeper rooted misogyny exposes further problems with the horror genre and its catering to a white audience.&lt;ref name="Indian Burial Ground"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Arial|last=Smith|title=This Essay Was Not Built On an Ancient Indian Burial Ground|url=https://offscreen.com/view/horror-indigenous-cinema|magazine=Offscreen|publisher=Kai Branch|location=Melbourne, Australia|date=August 2014|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also exemplifies issues of racism within film making and how, according to Harry M. Benshoff, "the vast majority of those films use race as a marker of monstrosity in ways generically consistent with the larger social body's assumptions about white superiority".&lt;ref name="Benshoff"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Harry M.|last=Benshoff|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1225551?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|title=Blaxploitation Horror Films: Generic Reappropriation or Reinscription?|journal=[[Cinema Journal]]|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|location=Austin, Texas|volume=39|issue=2|date=Winter 2000|pages=31–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The horror genre seems to be the genre within cinema that has the most space to comment on issues of race and gender due to its extremist nature and access to allegorical imagery. Ariel Smith states that "by forcing the subconscious fears of audiences to the surface, horror cinema evokes reactions, psychologically and physically: this is the genre's power."&lt;ref name= "Native Cinema"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Arial|last=Smith|url=https://decolonization.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/indigenous-cinema-and-the-horrific-reality-of-colonial-violence/|chapter=Indigenous Cinema and the Horrific Reality of Colonial Violence|journal=Decolonization: Indigeneity, Education &amp; Society|date=February 13, 2015|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre holds a great amount of potential to not only explore violence against women and minorities, but also inform the public and show the extents of that violence in a powerful way."&lt;ref name="Native Cinema"/&gt; However, instead of bringing these issues into a public appeal, it only seems to be making the issues worse with neglect to these issues and highly racialized/gendered points of storytelling.&lt;ref name= "Race in Horror"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Ashlee|last=Blackwell|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/744889-black-fear-sides-thinking-race-horror-films|title=Black (Fear) On Both Sides: Thinking About Candyman, Blacula and Race in Horror Films|magazine=comingsoon.net|date=February 10, 2015|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By constantly reusing and creating trope images/plot devices like the "[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] [[burial ground]]" and "[[Magical Negro|Mythical Negro]]"&lt;ref name= "Black Tropes"&gt;{{cite web|first=Valerie|last=Complex|title=Will It Get Better For Black People In the Horror Genre?|website=Black Girl Nerds|publisher=Black Girl Nerds, LLC|location=Virginia Beach, Virginia|date=July 31, 2015|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; these films trap an entire minority in a set role in cinema while also rendering the reality of their cultures invisible.&lt;ref name="Indian Burial Ground" /&gt;

==Meaning==
The basic [[premise]] of the concept of '''mundane reason''' is that the standard assumptions about reality that people typically make as they go about day to day, including the very fact that they experience their reality as perfectly natural, are actually the result of social, cultural, and historical processes that make a particular perception of the world readily available. It is the reasoning about the world, self, and others which presupposes the world and its relationship to the observer; according to [[Steven Shapin]] (Shapin 1994:31), it is a set of presuppositions about the subject, the object, and the nature of their relations.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin, S. 1994, ''A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Parallel Scale Nomogram.svg|right|400px|thumb|A typical parallel-scale nomogram. This example calculates the value of T when S = 7.30 and R = 1.17 are substituted into the equation. The isopleth crosses the scale for T at just under 4.65.]]

A '''nomogram''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] νόμος ''nomos'', "law" and γραμμή ''grammē'', "line"), also called a '''nomograph''', '''alignment chart''' or '''abaque''', is a graphical calculating device, a two-dimensional diagram designed to allow the approximate graphical computation of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]]. The field of nomography was invented in 1884 by the French engineer [[Philbert Maurice d'Ocagne|Philbert Maurice d’Ocagne]] (1862-1938) and used extensively for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas to a practical precision. Nomograms use a parallel [[coordinate system]] invented by d'Ocagne rather than standard [[Cartesian coordinates]].

A nomogram consists of a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. The result is obtained by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable. The virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an ''index line'' or ''isopleth''.

Nomograms flourished in many different contexts for roughly 75 years because they allowed quick and accurate computations before the age of pocket calculators. Results from a nomogram are obtained very quickly and reliably by simply drawing one or more lines. The user does not have to know how to solve algebraic equations, look up data in tables, use a [[slide rule]], or substitute numbers into equations to obtain results. The user does not even need to know the underlying equation the nomogram represents. In addition, nomograms naturally incorporate implicit or explicit [[domain knowledge]] into their design. For example, to create larger nomograms for greater accuracy the nomographer usually includes only scale ranges that are reasonable and of interest to the problem. Many nomograms include other useful markings such as reference labels and colored regions. All of these provide useful guideposts to the user. 
[[Image:Smith chart gen.svg|right|thumbnail|250px|An impedance [[Smith chart]] (with no data plotted)]]

Like a slide rule, a nomogram is a graphical analog computation device, and like the slide rule, its accuracy is limited by the precision with which physical markings can be drawn, reproduced, viewed, and aligned. While the slide rule is intended to be a general-purpose device, a nomogram is designed to perform a specific calculation, with tables of values effectively built into the construction of the [[Scale (ratio)|scales]]. Nomograms are typically used in applications where the level of accuracy  they offer is sufficient and useful. Alternatively, a nomogram can be used to check an answer obtained from another, more exact but possibly error-prone calculation. 

Other types of graphical calculators such as '''intercept charts''', '''trilinear diagrams''' and '''hexagonal charts''' are sometimes called nomograms. Other such examples include the [[Smith chart]], a graphical calculator used in [[electronics]] and [[systems analysis]], [[thermodynamic diagram]]s and [[tephigram]]s, used to plot the vertical structure of the atmosphere and perform calculations on its stability and humidity content. These do not meet the strict definition of a nomogram as a graphical calculator whose solution is found by the use of one or more linear isopleths.

==Description==
[[Image:Components of a Nomogram.png|right|300px|thumb|Components of a parallel-scale nomogram]]
A nomogram for a three-variable equation typically has three scales, although there exist nomograms in which two or even all three scales are common. Here two scales represent known values and the third is the scale where the result is read off.  The simplest such equation is ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for the three variables ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. An example of this type of nomogram is shown on the right, annotated with terms used to describe the parts of a nomogram.

More complicated equations can sometimes be expressed as the sum of functions of the three variables. For example, the nomogram at the top of this article could be constructed as a parallel-scale nomogram because it can be expressed as such a sum after taking logarithms of both sides of the equation.

The scale for the unknown variable can lie between the other two scales or outside of them. The known values of the calculation are marked on the scales for those variables, and a line is drawn between these marks. The result is read off the unknown scale at the point where the line intersects that scale. The scales include 'tick marks' to indicate exact number locations, and they may also include labeled reference values. These scales may be [[linear]], [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], or have some more complex relationship.

The sample isopleth shown in red on the nomogram at the top of this article calculates the value of ''T'' when ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7.30 and ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.17. The isopleth crosses the scale for ''T'' at just under 4.65; a larger figure printed in high resolution on paper would yield ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4.64 to three-digit precision. Note that any variable can be calculated from values of the other two, a feature of nomograms that is particularly useful for equations in which a variable cannot be algebraically isolated from the other variables.

Straight scales are useful for relatively simple calculations, but for more complex calculations the use of simple or elaborate curved scales may be required. Nomograms for more than three variables can be constructed by incorporating a grid of scales for two of the variables, or by concatenating individual nomograms of fewer numbers of variables into a compound nomogram.

==Applications==
Nomograms have been used in an extensive array of applications. A sample includes

* The original application by d'Ocagne, the automation of complicated [[cut and fill]] calculations for earth removal during the construction of the French national railway system. This was an important proof of concept, because the calculations are non-trivial and the results translated into significant savings of time, effort, and money.
* The design of channels, pipes and weirs for regulating the flow of water.
* The work of [[Lawrence Henderson]], in which nomograms were used to correlate many different aspects of blood physiology. It was the first major use of nomograms in the United States and also the first medical nomograms anywhere. Nomograms continue to be used extensively in medical fields.
* Ballistics calculations prior to fire control systems, where calculating time was critical.
* Machine shop calculations, to convert blueprint dimensions and perform calculations based on material dimensions and properties. These nomograms often included markings for standard dimensions and for available manufactured parts.
* Statistics, for complicated calculations of properties of distributions and for operations research including the design of acceptance tests for quality control.
* Operations Research, to obtain results in a variety of optimization problems.
* Chemistry and chemical engineering, to encapsulate both general physical relationships and empirical data for specific compounds.
* Aeronautics, in which nomograms were used for decades in the cockpits of aircraft of all descriptions. As a navigation and flight control aid, nomograms were fast, compact and easy-to-use calculators.
* Astronomical calculations, as in the post-launch orbital calculations of [[Sputnik 1]] by P.E. Elyasberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rgantd.ru/book_2.php?link=mozjorin Yu.A.Mozzhorin Memories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018165625/http://rgantd.ru/book_2.php?link=mozjorin |date=2007-10-18 }} at the website of Russian state archive for scientific-technical documentation&lt;/ref&gt;
* Engineering work of all kinds: Electrical design of filters and transmission lines, mechanical calculations of stress and loading, optical calculations, and so forth.
* Military, where complex calculations need to be made in the field quickly and with reliability not dependent on electrical devices.
*[[Seismology]], where nomograms have been developed to estimate earthquake [http://web.csulb.edu/~rodrigue/geog458558/labs/nomogram.html magnitude]

==Examples==

===Parallel-resistance/thin-lens===
[[Image:Nomogramparallelresistance.svg|right|200px|thumb|Parallel [[electrical resistance]] nomogram]]
The nomogram below performs the computation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1/A+1/B}=\frac{AB}{A+B}&lt;/math&gt;

This nomogram is interesting because it performs a useful nonlinear calculation using only straight-line, equally graduated scales. While the diagonal line has a scale &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; times larger than the axes scales, the numbers on it exactly match those directly below or to its left, and thus it can be easily created by drawing a straight line diagonally on a sheet of [[graph paper]].

''A'' and ''B'' are entered on the horizontal and vertical scales, and the result is read from the diagonal scale.  Being proportional to the [[harmonic mean]] of ''A'' and ''B'', this formula has several applications.  For example, it is the [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel-resistance formula]] in [[electronics]], and the [[Thin lens|thin-lens equation]] in [[optics]].

In the example, the red line demonstrates that parallel resistors of 56 and 42&amp;nbsp;[[ohm]]s have a combined resistance of 24&amp;nbsp;ohms. It also demonstrates that an object at a distance of 56&amp;nbsp;cm from a [[lens (optics)|lens]] whose [[focal length]] is 24&amp;nbsp;cm forms a [[real image]] at a distance of 42&amp;nbsp;cm.

===Chi-squared test computation===
[[Image:chisquarenomo3.png|right|200px|thumb|[[Chi-squared distribution]] nomogram]]
The nomogram below can be used to perform an approximate computation of some values needed when performing a familiar statistical test, [[Pearson's chi-squared test]]. This nomogram demonstrates the use of curved scales with unevenly spaced graduations.

The relevant expression is

:&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

The scale along the top is shared among five different ranges of observed values: A, B, C, D and E. The observed value is found in one of these ranges, and the tick mark used on that scale is found immediately above it. Then the curved scale used for the expected value is selected based on the range. For example, an observed value of 9 would use the tick mark above the 9 in range A, and curved scale A would be used for the expected value. An observed value of 81 would use the tick mark above 81 in range E, and curved scale E would be used for the expected value. This allows five different nomograms to be incorporated into a single diagram.

In this manner, the blue line demonstrates the computation of

:(9 &amp;minus; 5)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ 5 = 3.2

and the red line demonstrates the computation of

:(81 &amp;minus; 70)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / 70 = 1.7

In performing the test, [[Yates's correction for continuity]] is often applied, and simply involves subtracting 0.5 from the observed values. A nomogram for performing the test with Yates's correction could be constructed simply by shifting each "observed" scale half a unit to the left, so that the 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ... graduations are placed where the values 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ... appear on the present chart.

===Food risk assessment===
[[Image:Risk Based Sampling Nomogram (3yr).png|right|200px|thumb|Food [[risk assessment]] nomogram]]
Although nomograms represent mathematical relationships, not all are mathematically derived.  The following one was developed graphically to achieve appropriate end results that could readily be defined by the product of their relationships in subjective units rather than numerically. The use of non-parallel axes enabled the non-linear relationships to be incorporated into the model.

The numbers in square boxes denote the axes requiring input after appropriate assessment.

The pair of nomograms at the top of the image determine the probability of occurrence and the availability, which are then incorporated into the bottom multistage nomogram.

Lines 8 and 10 are ‘tie lines’ or ‘pivot lines’ and are used for the transition between the stages of the compound nomogram.

The final pair of parallel logarithmic scales (12) are not nomograms as such, but reading-off scales to translate the risk score (11, remote to extremely high) into a sampling frequency to address safety aspects and other ‘consumer protection’ aspects respectively.  This stage requires political ‘buy in’ balancing cost against risk.  The example uses a three-year minimum frequency for each, though with the high risk end of the scales different for the two aspects, giving different frequencies for the two, but both subject to an overall minimum sampling of every food for all aspects at least once every three years.

This [[risk assessment]] nomogram was developed by the [[Public analyst|UK Public Analyst Service]] with funding from the [[Food Standards Agency|UK Food Standards Agency]] for use as a tool to guide the appropriate frequency of sampling and analysis of food for official food control purposes, intended to be used to assess all potential problems with all foods, although not yet adopted.

===Sample size estimation===
[[File:Power0501.pdf|thumb|Nomograph for Sample Size Estimation]]

This nomograph can be used to estimate the sample size requirements for statistical analyses. It uses four parameters: ''&amp;alpha;'' (fixed), effect size (''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;''), statistical power, and number of cases ''N'' (two scales for ''&amp;alpha;'' = .05 (liberal) or .01 (conservative)).

The hypothesized effect size in the population can either be expressed as a correlation coefficient (''&amp;rho;'') or a normalized difference in means (''&amp;delta;'') for a [[T-test]]. The normalized difference is equal to the absolute value of the difference between two population means (''&amp;mu;''₁ &amp;minus; ''&amp;mu;''₂), divided by the pooled standard deviation (''s'').

The statistical power desired is estimated by 1 &amp;minus; ''&amp;beta;'', where ''&amp;beta;'' is equal to the probability of making a Type&amp;nbsp;II error. A [[type II error|''Type&amp;nbsp;II'' error]] is failing to reject the statistical null hypothesis (i.e., ''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;'' is zero), when in fact the null hypothesis is false in the population and should be rejected. Cohen (1977)&lt;ref name=Cohen_1977&gt;Cohen, J. (1977). ''Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences'', 2nd.&amp;nbsp;ed. San Diego, CA: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; recommends using power equal to 0.80 or 80%, for a ''&amp;beta;'' = 0.20&amp;nbsp;.

The sample size or number of cases required is reported for two standard levels of statistical significance (''&amp;alpha;'' = 0.01 or 0.05). The value of ''&amp;alpha;'' is the probability of making a Type&amp;nbsp;I error. A [[type I error|''Type&amp;nbsp;I'' error]] is rejecting the statistical null hypothesis (i.e., claiming that either ''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;'' is zero), when in fact it ''is'' true (the value ''is'' zero) in the population and should ''not'' be rejected. The most commonly used values of &amp;alpha; are 0.05 or 0.01&amp;nbsp;.

To find the sample size requirements for a given statistical analysis, estimate the effect size expected in the population (''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;'') on the left hand axis, select the desired level of power on the right hand axis, and draw a line between the two values.

Where the line intersects with either the ''&amp;alpha;'' = 0.05 or ''&amp;alpha;'' = 0.01 middle axis will indicate the sample size required to achieve statistical significance of ''&amp;alpha;'' less than 0.05 or 0.01, respectively (for the previously given parameters).

For instance, if one estimates the population correlation (''&amp;rho;'') to be 0.30, and desires statistical power equal to 0.80, then to obtain a significance level of ''&amp;alpha;'' less than 0.05, the sample size requirement would be ''N'' = 70 cases rounded up (more precisely approximately 68&amp;nbsp;cases using interpolation).

The prefix ''[[wikt:pan-|pan-]]'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word for "all, every", ''πᾶν''; ''[[wikt:omni-|omni-]]'' comes from the Latin word for "all", ''omnis''. The [[hybrid word]]s ''pansexual'' and ''pansexualism'' were first attested in 1917, denoting the idea "that [[Libido|the sex instinct]] plays the primary part in all human activity, mental and physical",&lt;ref name="Bi-Gay-Pansexual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pansexual |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date= |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reproach (credited to [[Sigmund Freud]]) levelled at early [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="Bi-Gay-Pansexual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another early definition was "the pervasion of all conduct and experience with sexual emotions"; as in ''[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pansexualism The Free Dictionary]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A literal [[denotation|dictionary definition]] of ''[[bisexuality]]'', due to the prefix ''[[wikt:bi-#English|bi-]]'', is sexual or romantic attraction to two [[sex]]es ([[male]]s and [[female]]s), or to two [[gender]]s ([[Man|men]] and [[Woman|women]]).&lt;ref name="Bi-Gay-Pansexual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="glaad"&gt;{{cite web|title=GLAAD Media Reference Guide |accessdate=March 14, 2012 |publisher=[[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] |url=http://www.glaad.org/document.doc?id=99 |archivedate=January 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101043203/http://www.glaad.org/document.doc?id=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pansexuality, however, composed with the prefix ''[[wikt:pan-#English|pan-]]'', is the sexual attraction to a person of any sex or gender. Using these definitions, pansexuality is defined differently by explicitly including people who are [[intersex]] or outside the [[gender binary]].&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bi-Gay-Pansexual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt;

Go Ask Alice! states that pansexuals can be attracted to [[cisgender]], [[transgender]], intersex and [[Androgyny|androgynous]] people, and that the term ''pansexual'' "is generally considered a more inclusive term than ''bisexual.''"&lt;ref name="Bi-Gay-Pansexual"/&gt; Volume 2 of [[Marshall Cavendish|Cavendish]]'s ''Sex and Society'', however, states that "although the term's literal meaning can be interpreted as 'attracted to everything,' people who identify as pansexual do not usually include [[paraphilia]]s, such as [[Zoophilia|bestiality]], [[pedophilia]], and [[necrophilia]], in their definition" and that they "stress that the term pansexuality describes only consensual adult sexual behaviors."&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt;

The definition of pansexuality can encourage the belief that it is the only [[sexual identity]] that covers individuals who do not cleanly fit into the categories of male or man, or female or woman.&lt;ref name="mental health"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt; However, bisexual-identified people and scholars may object to the notion that bisexuality means sexual attraction to only two genders, arguing that since ''bisexual'' is not simply about attraction to two sexes and encompasses attraction to different genders as well, it includes attraction to more than two genders.&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bisexual.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Doesn’t identifying as bisexual reinforce a false gender binary?|publisher=[[American Institute of Bisexuality]]|date=2014|accessdate=May 27, 2014|url=http://bisexual.org/qna/doesnt-identifying-as-bisexual-reinforce-a-false-gender-binary/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender is considered more complex than the state of one's sex, as gender includes genetic, hormonal, environmental and social factors.&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt; Furthermore, the term ''bisexual'' is sometimes defined as the romantic or sexual attraction to multiple genders.&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt; The [[Bisexual Resource Center]], for example, defines bisexuality as "an umbrella term for people who recognize and honor their potential for sexual and emotional attraction to more than one gender,"&lt;ref name="biresource.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/BRC_Brochure_2010.pdf |last =Bisexual Resource Council/[[Bisexual Resource Center]] |title =BRC Brochure 2010 |year =2010 |accessdate =7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[American Institute of Bisexuality]] states that the term ''bisexual'' "is an open and inclusive term for many kinds of people with same-sex and different-sex attractions"&lt;ref name="bisexual.org2"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the difference between bisexual and terms like pansexual, polysexual, omnisexual, ambisexual, and fluid?|publisher=[[American Institute of Bisexuality]]|date=2014|accessdate=May 27, 2014|url=http://bisexual.org/qna/what-is-the-difference-between-bisexual-and-terms-like-pansexual-polysexual-omnisexual-ambisexual-and-fluid/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "the scientific classification ''bisexual'' only addresses the physical, biological sex of the people involved, not the gender-presentation."&lt;ref name="bisexual.org"/&gt; According to the [[National Center for Transgender Equality]], 25% of American transgender people identify as bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetaskforceblog.org/2013/06/05/wonky-wednesday-trans-people-sexual-orientation/|last=Harrison|first=Jack|title=Wonky Wednesday: Trans people &amp; sexual orientation|date=5 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Shiri Eisner states that terms such as ''pansexual,'' ''omnisexual,'' ''[[polysexual]],'' ''[[queer]]'', etc. are being used in place of the term ''bisexual'' because "bisexuality, it's been claimed, is a gender binary, and therefore oppressive, word" and that "the great debate is being perpetuated and developed by bisexual-identified transgender and [[genderqueer]] people on the one hand, and non-bi-identified transgender and genderqueer people on the other." Eisner argues that "the allegations of binarism have little to do with bisexuality's actual attributes or bisexual people's behavior in real life" and that the allegations are a political method to keep the bisexual and transgender movements separated, because of those who believe that bisexuality ignores or erases the visibility of transgender and genderqueer people.&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt;

The American Institute of Bisexuality argues that "terms like ''pansexual'', ''polysexual'', ''omnisexual'', and ''ambisexual'' also describe a person with [[homosexual]] and [[heterosexual]] attractions, and therefore people with those labels are also bisexual" and that "by replacing the prefix bi – (two, both) with pan- (all), poly- (many), omni- (all), ambi- (both, and implying ambiguity in this case), people who adopt these labels seek to clearly express the fact that gender does not factor into their own sexuality," but "this does not mean, however, that people who identify as bisexual are fixated on gender."&lt;ref name="bisexual.org2"/&gt; The institute believes that the notion that if a person identifies as bisexual, then it is a reinforcement of a false gender binary is a notion that "has its roots in the anti-science, anti-Enlightenment philosophy that has ironically found a home within many Queer Studies departments at universities across the Anglophone world" and that "while it is true that our society's language and terminology do not necessarily reflect the full spectrum of human gender diversity, that is hardly the fault of people who choose to identify as bi. ... The Latin prefix bi- does indeed indicate two or both, however the 'both' indicated in the word bisexual are merely ''homosexual'' (lit. same sex) and ''heterosexual'' (lit. different sex)." The institute argues that heterosexuality and homosexuality, by contrast," are defined by the boundary of two sexes/genders. Given those fundamental facts, any criticism of bisexuality as reinforcing a gender binary is misplaced. Over time, our society's concept of human sex and gender may well change."&lt;ref name="bisexual.org"/&gt;

The term ''pansexuality'' is sometimes used interchangeably with ''bisexuality'', and, similarly, people who identify as bisexual may "feel that gender, biological sex, and sexual orientation should not be a focal point in potential [romantic/sexual] relationships."&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt; In one study analyzing sexual identities described as alternative terms for bisexual or bi-self labels, "half of all bisexual and bisexual-identified respondents also chose alternative self-labels such as ''queer'', ''pansexual'', ''pansensual,'' ''polyfidelitous,'' ''ambisexual,'' ''polysexual,'' or personalized identities such as 'byke' or 'biphilic'".&lt;ref name="Firestein"/&gt; Polysexuality is similar to pansexuality in definition, meaning "encompassing more than one sexuality," but not necessarily encompassing all sexualities. This is distinct from [[polyamory]], which means more than one intimate relationship at the same time with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved. American Institute of Bisexuality stated, "The term ''fluid'' expresses the fact that the balance of a person's homosexual and heterosexual attractions exists in a state of flux and changes over time."&lt;ref name="bisexual.org2"/&gt;

'''Police brutality''' is one of several forms of [[police misconduct]] which involves undue [[violence]] by [[police]] members.
Widespread police brutality exists in many countries and territories, even those that prosecute it. Although illegal, it can be performed under the [[Color (law)|color of law]].&lt;ref name="policechiefmagazine.org"&gt;Martinelli TJ. (2007). [http://policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=1208&amp;issue_id=62007 Minimizing Risk by Defining off-Duty Police Misconduct]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term "police brutality" was in use in the American press as early as 1872, when the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police Brutality: A Prisoner was shamefully beaten by Officers, he was Kicked and Pounded in a Cell ---Probably Fatally Injured|work=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=October 12, 1872}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported on the beating of a civilian under arrest at the Harrison Street Police Station.

The origin of 'modern' policing based on the authority of the [[nation state]] is commonly traced back to developments in seventeenth and 18th century [[France]], with [[Police#History|modern police departments]] being established in most nations by the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. [[Cases of police brutality]] appear to have been frequent then, with "the routine [[Wikt:bludgeon|bludgeoning]] of citizens by patrolmen armed with nightsticks or blackjacks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Marilynn S.|editor=Johnson|title=Street Justice: A History of Police Violence in New York City|year=2004|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=0-8070-5023-7|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale incidents of brutality were associated with labor [[Strike action|strikes]], such as the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]], the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894, the [[Lawrence textile strike]] of 1912, the [[Ludlow massacre]] of 1914, the [[Steel strike of 1919]], and the [[Hanapepe massacre]] of 1924.

Portions of the populations may perceive the police to be [[oppression|oppressors]]. In addition, there is a perception that victims of police brutality often belong to relatively powerless groups, such as minorities, the disabled, the young, and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powers|first=Mary D.|editor=Winters, Paul A.|title=Policing the Police|year=1995|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego|isbn=1-56510-262-2|pages=56–60|chapter=Civilian Oversight Is Necessary to Prevent Police Brutality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubert Locke writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;When used in print or as the battle cry in a [[black power]] rally, police brutality can by implication cover a number of practices, from calling a citizen by his or her first name to a death by a policeman's bullet. What the average citizen thinks of when he hears the term, however, is something midway between these two occurrences, something more akin to what the police profession knows as "alley court"—the wanton vicious beating of a person in custody, usually while [[handcuffs|handcuffed]], and usually taking place somewhere between the scene of the arrest and the [[Police station|station house]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=44|publisher=J. Urb. L.|page=625|date=1966–1967|title=Police Brutality and Civilian Review Boards: A Second Look|author=Locke, Hubert G.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/udetmr44&amp;section=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Kingbeating.jpg|thumb|Screenshots of [[Rodney King]] lying down and being beaten by [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers]] --&gt;
In March 1991, members of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] harshly beat an African American suspect, [[Rodney King]], while a white civilian videotaped the incident, leading to extensive media coverage and criminal charges against several of the officers involved. In April 1992, hours after the four police officers involved were acquitted at trial, the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]] commenced, causing 53 deaths, 2,383 injuries, more than 7,000 fires, damage to 3,100 businesses, and nearly $1 billion in financial losses. After facing federal trial, two of the four officers were convicted and received 32-month prison sentences. The case was widely seen as a key factor in the reform of the Los Angeles Police Department.

According to data released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (2011), between 2003 and 2009 at least 4,813 people died in the process of being arrested by local police. Of the deaths classified as [[law enforcement]] homicides, 2,876 deaths occurred of which 1,643 or 57.1% of the people who died were "people of color".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kappeler|first=Victor|title=Being Arrested can be Hazardous to your Health, Especially if you are a Person of Color|url=http://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/being-arrested-can-be-hazardous-your-health-especially-if-you-are-person-color}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===

In Vienna there tends to be an association made between Vienna's drug problem and the city's African migrants. This has led to the existence of negative cultural stereotypes which have then led to the racial profiling of African migrants, due to the negative associations with their ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viennareview.net/news/austria/reactions-to-police-brutality|title=Reactions to Police Brutality|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of highly publicised incidents in Austria where police have either tortured, publicly humiliated, or violently beaten people - in some cases to the point of death. The most notorious of these incidents occurred in the late 1990s, however recent reports in 2015 show that police are still treating civilians in this way.

====Examples====

* '''24 April 1996:''' Mr Jevremovic, a Serbian Romani man, tried to pay a friend's parking fine and was harassed by police for it. He escaped, and later a large group of police came into his home without a warrant, and violently beat him and his wife before taking them both into custody. They were fined without reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.errc.org/article/romani-couple-beaten-by-police-in-Austria/1494|title=Romani Couple Beaten by Police in Austria - ERRC.org|website=www.errc.org|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''May 1996:''' Marcus Omofuma, an Illegal Nigerian immigrant, was being deported from Vienna when the officers taped him to his chair 'like a mummy' and stuck tape over his mouth. He suffocated whilst in police custody.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Austria: Incidents of Police Brutality Continue|last=|first=|date=24 March 2000|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''November 1998: ''' Dr. C, a black Austrian citizen, was stopped by police after reversing his car into a one-way street and asked, "Why are you driving the wrong way, nigger?". He was beaten unconscious and handcuffed. Police continued beating him after he regained consciousness. After he was arrested, he spent 11 days in hospital recovering.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
* ''' 28 July 2015:''' A 27-year-old man, suspected of being a pickpocket, was handcuffed and violently thrown to the ground whilst under police custody. Police said that the man had been injured whilst 'pressing his head against the wall.' Video evidence showed him being passive and compliant prior to the altercation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.at/20150811/video-shows-alleged-police-violence-in-vienna|title=Video shows alleged police violence in Vienna|date=2015-08-11|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cms.falter.at/falter/2015/08/11/polizei-luegen-und-ein-video/|title=Falter|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1 January 2015: ''' A middle-aged woman beaten and taken into custody after refusing a breathalyser test while walking home at night. She suffered a fractured coccyx and severe bruising to her head and knees. She filed a complaint and only after she found CCTV footage was the case reexamined by the prosecutor.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.at/20150313/video-of-police-arrest-shows-orgy-of-violence|title=Video of police arrest shows 'orgy of violence'|date=2015-03-13|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Police accountability ====

There has been a notable lack of commitment to addressing the violation of civilians' rights in Austria, with Amnesty International reporting that in 1998/1999 very few people who committed a violation of human rights were brought to justice. This was worsened by the fact that many people who made a complaint against police were brought up on counter-charges such as resisting arrest, defamation and assault.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; 
In 2014–2015, there were 250 accusations of police misconduct made against officers in Vienna, and not a single person was charged - however 1,329 people were charged with 'civil disorder' in a similar time period.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT)'s 2014 report included a number of complaints of police using excessive force with detainees and psychiatric patients. The culture of excusing police officers for their misconduct has continued well into the present day, and any complaints of mistreatment are often met with inadequate investigations and judicial proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/europe/austria|title=Austria|website=Amnesty International USA|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/austria/report-austria/|title=Austria 2015/2016|website=www.amnesty.org|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Actions to combat====

Austria has legislation in place which makes hate speech against anyone's race, religion, nationality or ethnicity illegal.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/253033.pdf|title=Austria 2015 Human Rights Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United States Bureau of Democracy and Labor|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws like this, which discourage discrimination, are able to help with altering public perceptions of different ethnic and cultural groups and subsequently reducing the number of racially motivated incidents of police brutality. Along with these efforts, Austria has a number of NGOs who are trying to implement programs which encourage positive cross-cultural relations, and more targeted programs such as racial sensitivity training for police. The Austrian police are also trying to find their own ways to prevent police brutality and to make the prosecution of police misconduct a smoother process.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

Starting in January 2016, Austrian police forces will be trialling the use of body cameras, which will be used to film their interactions with civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.at/20150817/austria-to-test-police-body-cameras|title=Austria to test police body cameras|date=2015-08-17|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hope is that this will make the prosecution of any officers who are excessively violent or forceful a lot easier as there will be solid evidence, and also that it will deter officers from behaving violently in the first place, as they will know they are being monitored. It is unsure how long the trial will last, however as of July 2016 it is still ongoing.

Incidents of police brutality seem to still be occurring at a consistent rate, however it is yet to be seen whether the trial of body cameras will make a difference to the number of incidents occurring or to the number of police who are prosecuted for misconduct. Additionally, there needs to be more work done by the government to break down negative social stereotypes that can lead to prejudice, racial profiling and the kind of aggressive hatred which is the driving force behind many instances of police brutality - the involvement of NGOs is valuable however the Austrian government needs to take a strong stance against abuse of power by police in order for real change to happen. One way to do this, as suggested by Amnesty International Austria, would be to disband the ''Bereitschaftspolizei'', Vienna's riot police, as these officers have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations of police brutality.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Amnesty also suggest that Austria should adopt a National Action Plan against Racism (as is required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action) - something which they have previously refused to do.&lt;ref name="amnestyusa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-austria-2013|title=Annual Report: Austria 2013|website=Amnesty International USA|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a whole, Austria is moving slowly towards eradicating police brutality, however there needs to be much more done in order to ensure the rights of citizens are sufficiently protected.

=== Bangladesh ===
{{Expand section|date=February 2016}}
Many have been viciously beaten by police in [[Bangladesh]]. Various protesters were beaten with bats and sticks while protesting {{clarify span|text=to insult of Islam|explain=Were they protesting insults against Islam or were they protesting to insult Islam?|date=November 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://progressbangladesh.com/police-brutality-and-corruption-on-steep-rise/|title=Police Brutality and Corruption on Steep Rise|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a young man named Shamim Reja was killed by police in Sonargaon police station. The victim’s father claimed that his son was brutally tortured in the police station as the police wanted 6 lakh taka (BDT 600,000). Police investigated this and found the officer in charge Arup Torofar and SI Paltu Ghush and ASP Uttam Prashad guilty as charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://progressbangladesh.com/police-brutality-and-corruption-on-steep-rise/|title=Police Brutality and Corruption on Steep Rise {{!}} Progress Bangladesh|website=progressbangladesh.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shahbag, Bangladesh on January 26th, 2017, hundreds of protestors of Bangladesh India Friendship Power Company were taken into custody under extreme force by police officers. The protestors were violently mistreated. They were also struck by police officers, and had a water cannon, tear gas, and baton charges used on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Khan Chandan |first1=Md Shahnawaz |title=Our Silence on Police Brutality |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/opinion/our-silence-police-brutality-1355386 |website=thedailystar,net |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
Previously a three tier system, Belgian law enforcement now consists of two police forces operating on a federal and local level. While the two services remain independent, they integrate for purposes of recruitment and common training. This structural reform occurred in 2001 following a national parliamentary report into a series of paedophile murders which proved police negligence and severely diminished public confidence. Currently, approximately 33,000 local police and 900 civilians work across 196 regional police forces.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benoît|first=Majerus,|last2=Xavier|first2=Rousseaux,|date=2004-01-01|title=The World Wars and their Impact on the Belgian Police Systems|url=https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/1824|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations (UN) Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (1990) are replicated in Belgian law through The Criminal Code and the Police Functions Act.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; These principles dictate that use of force should be proportionate, appropriate, reported and delivered in a timely manner. However, the UN Human Rights Committee reported complaints of ill-treatment against both property and person by police escalated between 2005 and 2011, most commonly involving assault against persons no longer posing danger.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polis.osce.org/countries/details?item_id=8 |title=POLIS – Country Profiles of Participating and Partner States |website=polis.osce.org |access-date=2016-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517164252/http://polis.osce.org/countries/details?item_id=8 |archivedate=2016-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only this, but Belgian judicial authorities failed to notify national police watchdog, Committee P, of resulting criminal convictions against police. This is a direct breach of Belgian judicial procedure, as well as a failure to comply with Article 40 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/TBSearch.aspx?Lang=En&amp;CountryID=17&amp;ctl00_PlaceHolderMain_radResultsGridChangePage=4|title=Treaty bodies Search|website=tbinternet.ohchr.org|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extreme instance in January 2010 led to the death of Jonathan Jacob in Mortsel. The 26-year-old man was apprehended by local Mortsel police behaving strangely under the influence of amphetamines. Footage depicting how eight officers belonging to Antwerp police's Special Intervention Unit restrained and beat Jacob after he had been injected with a sedative has sparked public outrage. Jacob died from internal bleeding following the incident, but police claim they didn't make any mistakes and "acted carefully, respecting the necessary precautions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/News/1.1555242|title=Police brutality video sends shock wave through Belgium|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) convicted Belgium of human rights violations in a reverse judgement on the treatment of two brothers in custody who had been slapped. The Grand Chamber voiced its concern that, "A slap inflicted by a law-enforcement officer on an individual who is entirely under his control constitutes a serious attack on the individual's dignity".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberties.eu/en/news/ecthr-belgium-slapping-case-police-violence|title=Belgium Slapped for Police Slapping|last=Platform|first=European Liberties|website=Liberties.eu|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With cases such as these being downplayed by Belgian courts, the Belgian League of Human Rights (LDH) strive to fight police abuse through the Observatory of Police Violence (OBSPOL).&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obspol.be/|title=ObsPol – Observatoire des violences policières en Belgique|last=cressot|first=nicolas|website=www.obspol.be|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating since 2013, OBSPOL collect testimonies on its website and create a safe space for victims of police brutality by informing them of their rights and strongly advocating to adapt public policy for victim protection.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The Police in [[Brazil]] has a history of violence against the lower classes, which dates back to the nineteenth century, when it served primarily as an instrument of control over the mass of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, Thomas H.

"Armed Actors, Organised Violence and State Failure in Latin America" Zed Books, 1988. {{ISBN|1842774441}} - Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the second half of the twentieth century, the country experienced a strong urbanization, while over [[Brazilian military government|its last military dictatorship]], its police forces came under the responsibility of state governments, experiencing a strong process [[Military Police (Brazil)|of militarization]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrade, John.

The continuous militarist approach in dealing with social issues, gradually led the country to record violence levels and in 2015 Brazil have more violent deaths than [[Syrian Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/brazil-deaths-violent-crime-syria-police-brutality-report-brazilian-forum-for-public-security-a7386296.html Article] at [[The Independent]], October 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; with most people fearing the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2015/07/1662655-maioria-da-populacao-diz-ter-medo-da-policia-militar-aponta-datafolha.shtml Article] at "Folha de São Paulo" {{pt}}, July 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, amidst an environment entangled by corruption, Brazilian police have its routine selective brutality matching a traditional impunity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323836504578553643435119434 Article] at "The Wall Street Journal", July 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/opinion/the-terrifying-impunity-of-brazils-riot-police.html?_r=0 Article] at New York Times, October 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/why-do-brazilian-police-kill Article] about Brazilian police violence, November 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{Main|List of cases of police brutality in Canada}}
There have been a number of high-profile cases of alleged police brutality, including [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit protests]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rabble.ca/news/2010/07/medics-g20-protests-speak-out-against-police-brutality-0|title=Medics at G20 protests speak out against police brutality|work=rabble.ca|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[2012 Quebec student protests]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rabble.ca/news/2012/03/police-violence-rise-montreal|title=Police violence on the rise in Montreal|work=rabble.ca|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Robert Dziekański Taser incident]], and the [[Sammy Yatim|shooting of Sammy Yatim]].

On March 16, 2014, 300 people were arrested in Montreal during a protest against police brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/canada-police-brutality-arrests-166/|title=300 arrested at Montreal protest against police brutality|work=RT English|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===

In the recent years, [[Chile]]'s police force [[Carabineros de Chile]] has been under investigation because of various cases of power abuse and police brutality, especially towards students that participate in riots for better education, and the indigenous people [[Mapuche]], where there have been countless cases of violence to this group, guilting them for committing crimes. It was later discovered that some Carabineros officers were responsible for this crimes, to then blame Mapuches for the various incidents

====Mapuche genocide====

One of the most recent cases involving Mapuche kill spree was [[Camilo Catrillanca]]'s death. First reports of his death came from Carabineros itself, saying that Camilo was shooting at a police officer along other people after an investigation of 3 stolen cars, in which Camilo was a supposed suspect of involvement in this robbery. Carabinero's special forces '''Comando Jungla''' have been in the [[Araucanía Region]] on a mission of finding terrorists (as an excuse for killing Mapuches indiscriminately), and one of them was finding the robbers of the three cars. After finding Camilo "attacking" policemen with a gun in an attempt of escaping, was shot and killed by a headshot. It was later discovered that this wasn't what happened after one of the partners of the police officer that killed Camilo showed the video of the policeman killing him while he was driving a tractor. It was then asked to Carabineros why he didn't have a recording of him being shot at by Camilo. The institution responded, saying that he destroyed the SD card because it had private photos and videos with his wife. Most people were not satisfied with the answer and everyone knew it was a lie to cover what really happened. The policeman was later discharged and prosecuted. &lt;ref&gt;[[Rodrigo Acuña]].

Retrieved on 29 of November, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Croatia ===
The Constitution of [[Croatia]] prohibits torture, mistreatment and cruel and degrading punishment under Article 17, and accords arrested and convicted persons humane treatment under Article 25.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia 1990, viewed 20 July 2016, http://croatia.eu/article.php?lang=2&amp;id=25&lt;/ref&gt; Croatia has a centralised police force under the command of the Ministry of the Interior, with approximately 20,000 police officers.&lt;ref&gt;Interpol 2016, Croatia, viewed 19 July 2016, http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Europe/Croatia&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1991 to 1995, the Croatian police were a militarised force, charged with the role of defending the country during the secession from Yugoslavia, in addition to their regular police tasks.&lt;ref name="Ivkovic 2005, pp. 546"&gt;Ivkovic, S 2005, 'Police (mis)behaviour: a cross-cultural study of corruption seriousness', Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies &amp; Management, vol. 28, no. 3, pp. 546–566, doi: 10.1108/13639510510614609&lt;/ref&gt; Military training taught police officers to use firearms before exhausting other procedures, which has affected the philosophy and behaviour of police officers in using excessive force.&lt;ref name="Ivkovic, S 2000, pp. 194"&gt;Ivkovic, S &amp; Haberfeld, M 2000, 'Transformation from militia to police in Croatia and Poland – A comparative perspective', Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies &amp; Management, vol. 23, no. 2, pp. 194–217, doi: 10.1108/13639510010333831&lt;/ref&gt; Significant developments have been made to achieve democratic policing in a modern, professional force that is also accountable to the public.&lt;ref name="Ivkovic, S 2000, pp. 194"/&gt; However, citizen complaints of violent police behaviour suggest that the militarisation of the police force in the early 1990s continues to influence the level of force accepted as legitimate and reasonable by Croatian police officers.&lt;ref name="Ivkovic 2005, pp. 546"/&gt;

On numerous occasions the European Court of Human Rights has found that Croatian police authorities have failed to fulfil their obligations under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms by failing to carry out effective investigations to protect its citizens, and tourists, from violent attacks.&lt;ref name="irb-cisr.gc.ca"&gt;Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada 2015, Croatia: Police Structure, including hierarchy and jurisdiction; police effectiveness, particularly regarding treatment of ethnic minorities (2012-June 2014), HRV104892.E, viewed 19 July 2016, http://irb-cisr.gc.ca/Eng/ResRec/RirRdi/Pages/index.aspx?doc=455395&amp;pls=1&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the European Court of Human Rights delivered a judgement condemning Croatian police authorities for failing to take any steps to bring perpetrators of a violent attack on a Croatian citizen to justice by ignoring requests to conduct an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;European Roma Rights Centre 2009, Court condemns Croatia for failing to fulfil its positive obligations under Article 3 of the ECHR, viewed 20 July 2016, http://www.errc.org/article/court-condemns-croatia-for-failing-to-fulfill-its-positive-obligations-under-article-3-of-the-echr/3041&lt;/ref&gt;

The Croatian police have a history of discriminatory abuse and failing to recognise violence against the ethnic minority Romani population living in Croatia. The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance has noted that Croatian police abuse against minority groups including Roma people are continually reported.&lt;ref&gt;Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada 2015, Croatia: Treatment of minority groups, including Roma, Serbs, Bosnians, and Romanians; state protection available in cases of violence and discrimination, including legislation (2012-June 2015), HRV105202.E, viewed 19 July 2016, http://www.refworld.org/docid/55bf4ac04.html&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ongoing reluctance by police authorities to take violence against Roma seriously.&lt;ref name="irb-cisr.gc.ca"/&gt; Police investigations into black market selling in Croatia have been excessively violent towards Romani vendors, with reports of physical violence and abusive racism being directed at Roma.&lt;ref name="errc.org"&gt;European Roma Rights Centre 2002, Police beat pregnant Romani woman in Croatia, viewed 20 July 2016, http://www.errc.org/article/police-beat-pregnant-romani-woman-in-croatia/1582&lt;/ref&gt; Romani Women's Association, "Better Future", reported in 2002 that police had beaten a pregnant Romani woman who attempted to evade arrest for black market selling.&lt;ref name="errc.org"/&gt;

Croatian police violence has been used to intimidate refugees travelling from Serbia into Croatia.&lt;ref name="moving-europe.org"&gt;Moving Europe 2016, Report of Push-backs and Police violence at the Serbo-Croatian border, viewed 20 July 2016, http://moving-europe.org/report-on-push-backs-and-police-violence-at-the-serbo-croatian-border-2/&lt;/ref&gt; This has included segregation of nationalities, with Syrian, Iraqi and Afghani nationals gaining entry to Croatia as refugees much more easily than other nationalities.&lt;ref name="moving-europe.org"/&gt; An unaccompanied sixteen-year-old from Morocco recounted his experience in attempting to gain asylum in Croatia after lying about being a Syrian national: "We had to get into a police car…They told us this is Slovenia, but then it was Serbia…One of my friends tried to run away, but the Croatian police caught [sic] him and beat him."&lt;ref name="moving-europe.org"/&gt; Police beatings are illustrative of the systemic discriminatory violence that exists within the Croatian police force.

=== Denmark ===
[[Denmark]] currently has a police force consisting of approximately 11,000 officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Police: Organisation|url=https://www.politi.dk/en/About_the_police/organisation/|website=Politi|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These officers serve with the Danish National Police, in the 12 police districts and in the two Danish overseas territories. The Danish Independent Police Complaints Authority (Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed) (the Authority) handles the investigation of police misconduct allegations.&lt;ref name="politiklagemyndigheden.dk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Police Complaints Authority|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/english|website=Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Annual statistics released by the Authority reveal a reduction in the number of complaints against police during the period from 2012 until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adfaerdsklager|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/udgivelser-og-tal/politikredsstatistik/adfaerdsklager|website=Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed|accessdate=18 July 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in 2012, the Authority received a total of 726 conduct complaints from across Denmark. However, in 2015, this number had fallen to 509. This represents approximately 0.05 complaints per officer. A majority of complaints extend from general misconduct, such as traffic violations and unprofessional behaviour (e.g. swearing).&lt;ref name="politiklagemyndigheden1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arsberetning 2015|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/media/15820/a_rsberetning_2015_netversion.pdf|publisher=Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed (Independent Police Complaints Authority)|accessdate=18 July 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the 2015 Annual Report does identify some instances where the [[Police of Denmark]] have used excessive force.&lt;ref name="politiklagemyndigheden1"/&gt;  For example, the Authority is currently investigating a complaint made about alleged violence against an arrested person in Christianshavn on 15 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Politiklagemyndigheden søger vidner til en episode på Christianshavn, hvor en polititjenestemand er anmeldt for vold|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/nyheder/pressemeddelelser-nyheder/2016/4/politiklagemyndigheden-soeger-vidner-til-en-episode-paa-christianshavn,-hvor-en-polititjenestemand-er-anmeldt-for-vold|website=Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed|accessdate=18 July 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another open investigation relates to the alleged use of force against a 16-year-old boy on 28 June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polititjenestemænd sigtet for vold begået mod en 16-årig dreng|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/nyheder/pressemeddelelser-nyheder/2016/6/polititjenestemaend-sigtet-for-vold-begaaet-mod-en-16-aarig-dreng|website=Den Uafhængige Politkilagemyndighed|accessdate=18 July 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has resulted in charges being laid against the two offending police officers from the Sydsjællands- and Lolland-Falster police department. Furthermore, although examples of police brutality are not common, highly publicised incidents have been reported.

====Examples====

In 2002, 21 year-old Jens Arne Orskov Mathiason died while in police custody and on the way to prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denmark: Jens Arne Ørskov's death in custody: A mother's quest for justice|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/44c610894.html|website=refworld|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=18 July 2016|pages=1–6|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The incident raised concerns over the behaviour of the officers involved, the thoroughness of the subsequent investigation and the willingness of the Director of Public Prosecutions' to hold the officers accountable for their alleged failings. As a result, [[Amnesty International]] has called for the establishment of new mechanisms to investigate human rights violations and to enforce compliance with obligations under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denmark: Jens Arne Ørskov's death in custody: A mother's quest for justice|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/44c610894.html|website=refworld|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=18 July 2016|page=6|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, another man died in police custody after being arrested by seven officers from the Copenhagen Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man died while in custody of Danish police|url=http://www.thelocal.dk/20160108/man-died-while-in-custody-of-danish-police|accessdate=18 July 2016|agency=The Local DK|date=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, police in Copenhagen were heavily criticised for their response to an attempt to dislodge Iraqi refugees who were living in a city church.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Matthew Saltmarsh|author2=Catherine Contiguglia|title=Raid in Denmark to Dislodge Iraqi Refugees Leads to Protests and Hunger Strike|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/15/world/europe/15denmark.html|accessdate=18 July 2016|agency=New York Times|date=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Amateur video allegedly showed the police using violence against the refugees and their supporters. Between 12,000 and 20,000 people subsequently protested against these actions.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

In 2012, the [[Courts of Denmark|Danish Court of Appeal]] held that the Danish Police had violated Article 3 (against abusive treatment and torture) and Articles 5, 10 and 11 (dealing with the right to liberty, the right to information about the accusation and the freedom of peaceful assembly) of the European Convention of Human Rights, when, in 2009, they had made mass arrests during protests at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police found guilty of violating European Convention on Human Rights|url=http://www.socialistworld.net/doc/5713|accessdate=18 July 2016|agency=SocialistWorld.net|date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, video emerged of officers hitting people with batons and violently detaining a man, despite onlookers saying he couldn't breathe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Police hit everyone': Danish officers use batons on citizens, violently detain man|url=https://www.rt.com/news/341364-police-brutality-copenhagen-denmark/|accessdate=18 July 2016|agency=Russia Today|date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevention====

In order to ensure that police are well trained and to mitigate the risk of police brutality, police recruits undergo approximately three years of training. Firstly, at the National Police College, recruits learn about police theory, the Road Traffic Act, criminal law, physical training, other legislation, first aid, radio communication, securing evidence, identifying drugs, preventing crime, management, human rights and cultural sociology to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Police: How to become a police officer|url=https://www.politi.dk/en/About_the_police/admission/|website=Politi|publisher=Politi|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After this three-year probationary and training period, recruits are promoted to the position of police constable. By comparison, US police academies only provide an average of 19 weeks of classroom instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Paul Hirschfield|title=Why American Cops Kill So Many Compared To European Cops|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/american-cops-lethal_us_565cde59e4b079b2818b8870|accessdate=18 July 2016|agency=Huffington Post|date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This lengthy training in Denmark increases the ability of police to effectively de-escalate conflicts and enact their duties professionally and responsibly.

Furthermore, in order to keep police officers accountable and to ensure that they perform their duties in compliance with Danish, European and international laws, the Independent Police Complaints Authority has the power to handle investigations of criminal cases against police officers and decide complaints of police misconduct.&lt;ref name="politiklagemyndigheden.dk" /&gt;  This body is independent of both the police and prosecutors. By way of example, police:

{{Quote|text="...may use force only if necessary and justified and only by such means and to such extent as are reasonable relative to the interest which the police seek to protect. Any assessment of the justifiability of such force must also take into account whether the use of force involves any risk of bodily harm to third parties."|author=''Act on Police Activities'' (2004)|source=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Frode Z. Olsen|title=The Use of Police Firearms in Denmark|url=https://www.politi.dk/NR/rdonlyres/20DE43AF-33F4-48C5-A710-6A58457E35D2/0/Engelskresum%C3%A9afendeligrapport.pdf|website=Politi|publisher=Politi|accessdate=18 July 2016|page=2|language=English|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Therefore, police in Denmark are held to high standards and will face consequences if they breach their obligations. This encourages compliance. Victims of police misconduct are encouraged to lodge a report with the Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do you want to complain about the police?|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/media/6447/1._korr_pm_pjece_uk.pdf|publisher=Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed (Independent Police Complaints Authority) |accessdate=18 July 2016|pages=1–14|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Estonia ===
The [[Estonian Police]] force ended in 1940 when they lost their independence to the Soviet Union.  The Police Act which was passed in 1990, set out the dissolution of the Russian Military and re-established the formation of the Estonian Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polis.osce.org/countries/details?item_id=16 |title=POLIS – Country Profiles of Participating and Partner States |website=polis.osce.org |access-date=2016-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816074034/http://polis.osce.org/countries/details?item_id=16 |archivedate=2016-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Public Order Police, Police Board, Central Criminal Police, Border Guard, Citizenship and Migration Board merged into one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Europe/Estonia|title=Estonia / Europe / Member countries / Internet / Home – INTERPOL|website=www.interpol.int|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence forming The Police and Border Guard Board. It is the currently the largest state agency in Estonia, with more than 5000 people in employment.  The main objectives for this organisation is to maintain security and public order, crime prevention, detection and investigation, securing the European Union (EU) border, citizenship and identity documentation administration.

According to the Estonian Ministry of Justice, crime figures have dropped by 10% since 2013 to 2015.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=17447|title=Estonia 2015 Crime and Safety Report|website=www.osac.gov|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who find themselves detained by the police should comply with their instructions. Those who experience a language barrier are allowed to "request the presence of an interpreter and should not sign any documents or reports until they are confident that the documents contents are consistent with the details of the incident or the victim's statement"&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Incidents of police abuse are very rare, however if it is witnessed, report it to the Office of Procurator General of Estonia. Although uncommon, powers are sometimes abused and hence this leads to brutality from police officers.  An example of this, is the riots that took place in 2007.
[[File:Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, 2007.jpg|thumb|The Bronze Soldier of Tallinn in its new location]]

==== Case example ====
The controversy and riots, more commonly referred to as the '[[Bronze Night]]' that surrounded Estonia in April 2007 when the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn was relocated.  The Government wanted to relocate the statue and rebury the associated remains near the Tallinn Military Cemetery; however, this led to massive uproar and protests. Historically in Estonia this Bronze Soldier served as a symbol of Soviet occupation and repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Culture+%26+Living&amp;articleid=a1230646924 |title=The Memory Remains |last=Johnston |first=Anthony |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=20 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812073257/http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Culture%2B&amp;%2BLiving&amp;articleid=a1230646924 |archivedate=12 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, to its current Russian citizens residing, it also represented Soviet's victory over Germany in World War II and their claim to equal rights in Estonia.
During the riots, one Russian rioter was killed and many other protesters were arrested.  Due to the overcrowded detention centres many of the detainees were taken to cargo terminals in Tallinn's seaport.  Andrei Zarenkov who was the chairman of the [[Constitution Party (Estonia)|Constitution Party]] stated "people were forced to squat for hours or lie on the concrete floor with their hands tied behind their backs. The police used plastics handcuffs which caused great pain. The police selectively beat the detainees including women and teenagers.

The police department denied all claims made against them. On the 22nd of May 2007, the Office of Procurator General of Estonia received more than fifty complaints on the police brutality that occurred during Bronze Night and hence opened seven criminal cases against them.  In November 2007, the [[United Nations Committee against torture|United Nations Committee Against Torture]] expressed concern over the excessive use of force and brutality by law enforcement personnel with regards to the Bronze night incident.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}  The Council of Europe published in its report, that those detained were not granted all the fundamental safeguards. This includes the right to access a doctor, a lawyer and to inform a relative or a third party of their arrest. Furthermore, it was later discovered that accused were only allowed to contact someone and be assisted by a lawyer when brought before a judge and a number of detainees were denied access to a doctor whilst in police custody even though they displayed visible injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1549981/500-held-in-fresh-Estonia-riots.html|title=500 held in fresh Estonia riots|last=agencies|first=By staff and|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Moving forward ====
The use of excessive force can be seen as "legal boundaries/ duty" in the eyes of policing agencies.  Police misconduct is regarded as illegal in many countries; it can be hidden when performed under the 'colour of law'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/221885.The_Color_of_Law|title=The Color of Law|last=Gimenez|first=Mark|publisher=Anchor|year=2006|isbn=|location=Dallas, Texas, US|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although police brutality is fairly uncommon in Estonia, it is vital that the Police and Border Guard Board to keep the fundamental safeguards in check and not breach these rights, regardless of the situation.

=== France ===
The policing structure of nineteenth century [[France]] has been linked to the outcomes of France's reorganisation during 1789–1799 which were France's time of revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/clive-emsley/french-police-19th-century |title=The French Police in the 19th Century |publisher=History Today |date=1982-01-01 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout France's history, there has been a wide array of instances of violent enforcement stemming from issues around racial and geographic differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefunambulist.net/2016/05/31/police-brutality-is-a-hollow-term-on-current-violence-in-france/ |title="Police Brutality Is a Hollow Term": On the Current Policing Violence in France |work=The Funambulist |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there have been reports conducted by the Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International concerning human rights violations by France including physical and psychological abuse as a result of excessive force towards Muslims when undertaking house raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/02/french-police-abuse-muslims-emergency-laws-160204035243925.html |title=French police 'abuse' Muslims under emergency laws |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2016-02-04 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France's police ombudsman is currently dealing with 48 judicial inquiries into police brutality against its citizens, in which 1,000 individuals have been arrested, within a three-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Angelique Chrisafis in Paris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/07/french-police-violence-labour-law-protests-watchdog |title=French police watchdog looks into violence at labour protests &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there have been a number of high profile cases of alleged police brutality which have gained significant media attention, including, the death of Lamine Dieng on 17 June 2007 who died after suffocating in a police van while he was constrained.&lt;ref name="ceasefiremagazine.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ali Meziane |url=https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/stolen-lives-generation-rises-french-police-violence/ |title=Stolen Lives: A new generation rises up against French police violence |publisher=Ceasefire Magazine |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation of Lamine's death is ongoing, and grey areas around police accountability have come to light, including questions over how his body was covered in bruises and whether or not carotid restraint was used against him. Carotid restraint is a form of restriction, which compresses one or both carotid arteries, and is used by police enforcement to control dangerous individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ari Vidali |url=http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/articles/2014/01/reconsidering-carotid-control.aspx |title=Reconsidering Carotid Control - Article - POLICE Magazine |publisher=Policemag.com |date=2014-01-30 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Court of Human Rights has condemned France in 1998 for their apparent use of carotid constriction.&lt;ref name="ceasefiremagazine.co.uk" /&gt; This same method of restraint was seen to be used against Hakim Sjimi who died of positional asphyxia as a result of overwhelming pressure being placed on his chest and neck by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riviera-press.fr/insider/node/24360 |title=Suspended sentences for Grasse police &amp;#124; Riviera Insider |publisher=Riviera-press.fr |date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, recent protests over disputed labor laws have brought to light the extreme nature of police brutality in France, as many videos have surfaced in the media depicting police using disproportionate force on protesters. French officials have forced these aggressive videos to be destroyed, as they demonstrated the unnecessary forced nature of individuals in Frances police department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/europe/2016/05/29/labor-law-protests-shadowed-by-police-brutality-in-france-before-euro-2016 |title=Labor law protests shadowed by police brutality in France before Euro 2016 |publisher=Daily Sabah |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, as a result of the increased number of cases of police brutality in French communities, a group has formed called the Collective of Stolen Lives who represent families of those who have been affected by police brutality. This group strongly demand the government to act against police brutality and to reduce racism present across the police force in France.&lt;ref name="ceasefiremagazine.co.uk" /&gt;

=== Finland ===
Historically, anti-communist police brutality was commonplace during the 1920s and 1930s – in the wake of the [[Finnish Civil War]]. Some local sections of the secret police ([[Etsivä Keskuspoliisi]]) routinely beat up arrested communists.

As of 2006, there were 7700 police officers in Finland.&lt;ref name="uta.fi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tampub.uta.fi/handle/10024/93527|title=Poliisien tekemät rikokset – normien valvojat normien rikkojina|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That police force was shown to be more law-abiding than firemen.&lt;ref name="uta.fi" /&gt; However, it was revealed there are a few dozen cases each year in which police officers are convicted of crimes committed while on duty, 5 to 10 percent of the hundreds of such crimes prosecuted annually – the number of such crimes being shown to increase yearly.&lt;ref name="uta.fi" /&gt; Police officers are most often suspected of traffic related crimes (endangering road safety, vehicular collisions etc.) which constitute approximately 50% of all cases. These types of cases were also the most likely to be dismissed before proceeding to the prosecutor for consideration.&lt;ref name="uta.fi" /&gt; Second most numerous category is the use of force, approximately 20%, which proceed to the prosecutor without a fail apart from few off-duty petty assaults. In Finland, a petty assault could mean a slap on the cheek.&lt;ref name="uta.fi" /&gt;

In 2006, a 51-year-old police constable attracted a 16-year-old girl to his house by showing her his badge, where he got her drunk and raped her twice. The constable was fired and sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/poliisi-raiskasi-16-vuotiaan---selvisi-ehdollisella/art-1288335053979.html|title=Poliisi raiskasi 16-vuotiaan – selvisi ehdollisella|work=Ilta-Sanomat|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, an Iranian-born immigrant, Rasoul Pourak, was beaten in a cell at Pasila Police Station, Helsinki. The ill-treatment caused Pourak bruises all over his body, an open wound over his eyebrow, and a fractured skull. In addition, facial bones were broken and the victim was left permanently damaged. One guard participating in the assault was sentenced to an 80-day suspended prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://takku.net/article.php/200710022319038|title=IL: Turvakameran dramaattinen tallenne – mies hakattiin julmasti Pasilan poliisiputkassa|work=Takku|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogit.mtv3.fi/kolmevarttia/2007/10/10/putkat-vailla-tallentavia-kameroita|title=Putkat vailla tallentavia kameroita|work=Kolme varttia|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, two police officers assaulted a man in a wheelchair in connection with an arrest. The police twisted the man's hands and pushed him backward causing him to break a femur.&lt;ref&gt;Iltasanomat 5 June 2010 Poliisi pahoinpiteli vammaisen&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, two policemen were sentenced to 35 [[day fine]]s for assault and breach of duty in connection with stamping on a man's head onto the asphalt thrice. According to the police, the man of [[Romani people|Romani]] descent resisted, yet according to eyewitnesses, the man did not resist. The event was captured in surveillance video, which was stored but accidentally destroyed according to a third officer present.&lt;ref name="HS.fi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/MTV3+Romanimiehen+p%C3%A4%C3%A4t%C3%A4+poljettiin+asvalttiin+poliiseille+sakot/a1379902738575?ref=hs-art-top-7|title=MTV3: Romanimiehen päätä poljettiin asvalttiin, poliiseille sakot|work=HS.fi|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/rikos.shtml/2013/09/1809380/poliisi-polki-romanimiehen-paata-asfalttiin|title=Poliisi polki romanimiehen päätä asfalttiin|work=mtv.fi|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the third officer, having seen the surveillance footage, testified that the video didn't show any resistance on the part of the Romani, but also that the assault happened out of view from the camera.&lt;ref name="HS.fi" /&gt;

=== Germany ===
Whilst Germany may be sensitive towards its history in implementing policing practices, this hasn't appeared to stop international bodies from identifying a clear pattern of police ill-treatment to foreigners and members of ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur23/001/2004/en/ |title=Document &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2004-01-14 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, around 2,000 complaints of police brutality are reported, with the figure most likely being a less than accurate representation given that not every incident is reported.&lt;ref name="dw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/preventing-police-brutality-in-germany/a-16641839 |title=Preventing police brutality in Germany &amp;#124; Germany &amp;#124; DW.COM &amp;#124; 03.03.2013 |publisher=DW.COM |date=2017-01-24 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As high profile cases like the Cologne New Year's Eve incident become more prevalent, racist and xenophobic attitudes have been reflected in instances of police brutality.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-01-08/german-police-are-too-soft-really |title=German Police Are Too Soft, Really - Bloomberg View |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst this incident occurred in 2014, high profile cases of police brutality have been reported to occur as far back as the 1990s.

History of Police Brutality:

'''28 May 1999''': Sudanese national Aamir Ageeb died of asphyxia during his forced deportation from Frankfurt. Prior to departure, Ageeb was forcibly restrained by tape and rope. During take-off, police officers allegedly forced his head and upper body between his knees.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
 
'''8 December 2000''': Josef Hoss was accused by his neighbour (a serving police officer) of harbouring firearms, which resulted in him being ambushed near his home, beaten and handcuffed. He woke up in the police station with a cloth bag over his head and had sustained multiple injuries that would prevent him from working and being able to financially support his family. No firearms were found upon investigation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;

'''May 2002''': Prior to his death, Stephen Neisius has spent 13 days in hospital on life support, after being repeatedly kicked and hit by a group of police officers as he lay handcuffed on the floor of a police station in the city. Although the Cologne District Court convicted all six police officers of bodily harm resulting in death, none of the accused served prison sentences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

'''2012''': After a fight with her boyfriend got out of hand, Teresa Z. called the police but was quickly arrested. Whilst in detention, she was punched by police officer Frank W. and left with a broken nose and eye socket. Frank W. spent ten months in jail and was forced to pay a fine of 3,000 euros.&lt;ref name="dw.com"/&gt;

As law enforcement is vested solely with the states of Germany, each state's police force (or 'Land' police) follows a different system of law. Accordingly, there is an absence of a federal comprehensive register, compiling and publishing regular, uniform and comprehensive figures on complaints about police ill-treatment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Even though Germany is bound to obligate its many international treaties and conventions, Amnesty International (2002) highlights the authorities failure to protect a range of human rights as guaranteed by international human rights law and standards.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Despite this objective lack of accountability for policing practice, levels of trust in police remain amongst the highest in the EU, only behind Scandinavian countries and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cepol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/03-confidence-police.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This allows Germany to maintain one of the lowest levels of public order and safety spending in the EU, at 1.5 percent of gross domestic profit, as compared to the EU average of 1.8 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Government_expenditure_on_public_order_and_safety |title=Government expenditure on public order and safety - Statistics Explained |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Germany has a police force of only 300 officers per 100,000 of its population. These numbers are only less in Scandinavian countries and the UK,&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Police_officers,_average_per_year,_2007–09_and_2010–12_(per_100_000_inhabitants)_YB14.png#file&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting that despite these instances of police brutality, Germany is attempting to build the impression of having a more laissez-faire approach to policing. Additionally, German police officers rarely use their guns, as there have only been 8 fatalities in the past two years and only 109 deaths by service weapons since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/why-german-police-officers-rarely-reach-for-their-guns/a-17884779 |title=Why German police officers rarely reach for their guns &amp;#124; Germany &amp;#124; DW.COM &amp;#124; 27.08.2014 |publisher=DW.COM |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece ===
The Greek Police, known officially as the Hellenic Police, assumed their current structure in 1984. This structure was the result of the merging of the Gendarmerie (Chorofylaki) and the Urban Police Forces (Astynomia Poleon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Europe/Greece|title=Greece / Europe / Member countries / Internet / Home - INTERPOL|website=www.interpol.int|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed of central and regional departments, the Hellenic Police have a relatively long history of police brutality. One of the first documented dates back to 1976, within which 16-year-old activist Sideris Isidoropoulos was killed by police while he put up campaign posters on a public building. Only a few years later and 1980 saw the death of 20-year-old protester Stamatina Kanelopoulou at the hands of the Greek police. Kanelopoulou was beaten to death by members of the police force during a demonstration to commemorate the 1973 uprising against the military junta. It is still common for protesters to commemorate the 1973 uprising, and protests are still rife with police brutality around the time of this event today, over three decades after Kanelopoulou's death.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/fragkiska-megaloudi/growing-police-brutality-in-greece_b_2636529.html|title=Growing Police Brutality in Greece: The Hidden Face of the Crisis|website=The Huffington Post|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Increase====

The level and severity of police brutality in Greece over the last few years has been quite alarming and surprising. Due to recent financial crisis many austerity measures have been put in place, meaning that many individuals and families are struggling to survive. Greek citizens have opposed these austerity measures from the beginning, showing their disapproval with strikes and demonstrations. In response, police brutality has increased significantly, with consistent reports on the use of tear gas, severe injuries inflicted by police force, and unjustified detention of protesters.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt;

In 2013 Greek police allegedly tortured four young men believed to be suspected of bank-robbery following their arrest. It was alleged that the men were hooked and severely beaten in detention. The media published photos of the men, all with severe bruising, yet in the police released digitally manipulated photos of the four to make it appear that they lacked any injuries. The Greek minister of citizen protection - Nikos Dendias - protected the police, claiming that the police needed to use photoshop to ensure the suspects were recognisable.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt; In October 2012 15 anti-fascists protesters were arrested in Athens when they clashed with supporters of the fascist party 'Golden Dawn.' Victims claimed they were tortured during detention at the Attica General Police Directorate, stating that police officers slapped them, spat on them, burnt their arms with cigarette lighters and kept them awake with torches and lasers. Again, Nikos Dendias responded by accusing the British newspaper that published the details of these crimes of lying. It was proven by forensic examination that the torture had in fact taken place. The two Greek journalists who commented on the Guardian report the next day were fired.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt;

====Recent instances====

Police brutality on Greece today predominantly manifests itself in the form of unjustified and extreme physical violence towards protesters and journalists. Amnesty International highlights that the continued targeting of journalists is very concerning as it infringes on the right to freedom of expression. According to a recent Amnesty International report there have been multiple instances in which police have used excessive brutal force, have misused less-lethal weapons against protesters, have attacked journalists, and have subjected bystanders to ill treatment, particularly over the course of the anniversary of the 1973 student uprising against the Military Junta, as mentioned previously, which took place on November 17, 2014.&lt;ref name="thetoc.gr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetoc.gr/eng/news/article/amnesty-international-condemns-greek-police-brutality|title=Amnesty International condemns Greek police brutality {{!}}thetoc.gr|date=2014-11-21|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations against police have emerged specifically in relation to their use of brutal force, completely unprovoked, towards journalists documenting the demonstration, and against many students who partook in a peaceful protest. Allegedly police sprayed protesters with chemical irritants from close range – in one instance a 17-year-old girl with asthma had been treated in hospital after this attack and when she informed police of her condition they merely laughed.&lt;ref name="thetoc.gr"/&gt;

Video footage confirms that just days prior, on November 13, 2014, riot police began to strike students who attempted to run away from the grounds of the Athens Polytechnic. Media reports suggest that around 40 protesters had to seek subsequent medical attention to injuries sustained from brutal police beatings.&lt;ref name="thetoc.gr"/&gt; Amnesty international also calls for action on prosecuting those who are behind these inhumane acts, stating that within the Greek police there is a culture of "abuse and impunity" which remains as authorities have taken very little action to address the crux of the problem.&lt;ref name="thetoc.gr"/&gt;

A German exchange student said he was beaten randomly by riot police in the Exarheia district, his only reason for being there that he had accompanied other students to eat. The student gives a horrifying description of the violence he endured, he cowered in a corner when he saw police because a few weeks before he had witnessed police beating a man they had arrested. He claims that upon spotting him, about six police officers started beating him with their batons, and when they left they were replaced by another group of police.&lt;ref name="thetoc.gr"/&gt; The student was unarmed and posed no threat but the police were ruthlessly brutal in their actions. It has been indicated that riot police left beaten and gravely individuals without any medical assistance. Amnesty International urges Greece to effectively and promptly investigate these crimes against civilians, which clearly violate human rights, and hold perpetrators accountable.&lt;ref name="thetoc.gr"/&gt;

====Examples====

May 2011, student Yannis Kafkas, suffered an almost fatal head injury after a police officer hit him with a fire extinguisher the riot police carry around. Kafkas spent 20 days in intensive care.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt;

June 2011, Manolis Kipraios, journalist, was covering protests against austerity measures when a member of the riot police fired a stun grenade against him. He now suffers from permanent hearing loss.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt;

February 2012, photojournalist Marios Lolos had to have surgery following being beaten in the head by police at a protest. The day before this attack another journalist Rena Maniou was reportedly severely beaten by security forces. Dimitris Trimis, the head of The Greek Journalist Association (ESEA) broke his arm after he was violently pushed and kicked by police.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt;

There have been some instances where protesters have been used as human shields – a photo of a female protester in handcuffs ahead of policeman as people threw rocks at the police has gained considerable media attention.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt;

None of the above cases of police brutality resulted in any prosecution of police force members, this severe lack of accountability and punishment for this type of crime is a major issue for human rights activists currently. One case which sparked nationwide riots was that of 15-year-old Alexis Grigoropoulos, who was shot dead by a police officer in December 2008 during demonstrations in Athens. In this case,  unlike the majority of cases, the police officer responsible was convicted of murder.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt;

=== Hong Kong ===
During the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]], there had been numerous instances of police brutality. Seven police officers had been caught on video kicking and beating a prominent political activist who was already handcuffed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://time.com/3508857/ken-tsang-hong-kong-police-brutality-occupy-central/ | work=TIME | title=Claims of Police Brutality Threaten to Escalate the Hong Kong Protests?}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had also been more than hundreds of incidents of police beating passers-by with batons. Pictures on local TV and social media show demonstrators being dragged behind police lines, circled by police officers so that onlookers' views were blocked, and in some cases re-emerging with visible injuries. The officer involved, retired police officer Frankly Chu King-wai, was sentenced to three months in prison for causing serious body harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/hong-kong-heavy-handed-policing-will-only-inflame-protests-2014-11-28 | work=Amnesty International | title=Hong Kong: Heavy-handed policing will only inflame protests}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/03/27/former-police-inspector-charged-misconduct-occupy-protests/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hungary ===

In 2008 when Hungary signed the [[Schengen Agreement]], its two law enforcement bodies, the Police ([[Rendőrség]]) and the [[Border guard|Border Guards]] merged. Border Guards became police officers. The police force in Hungary consists of the National Bureau of Investigation and the Operational police, these bodies dealing with investigating severe crimes and dealing with riots, respectively. In addition to these, Terrorelhárítási Központ, a police force with jurisdiction in all of Hungary deals mainly with counter-terrorism. 44,923 employees make up the Rendőrség force in Hungary. Brutality and corruption exist within Rendőrség.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/55bf50df4.html |title=Hungary: Police corruption, including complaints mechanisms available to report instances of corruption; police effectiveness, including response to complaints submitted by Roma (2013-June 2015) |publisher=Refworld |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1998 Human Rights Watch World Report revealed that the Roma minority in Hungary were continually discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/worldreport99/europe/hungary.html |title=HRW World Report 1999: Hungary:Human Rights Developments |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrimination was also evident in the police force, with reports of police mistreatment and brutality on the minority group.

The 2006 protests in Hungary demonstrate the brutal and disproportionate measures police may use, especially evident in these protests was police brutality on non-violent civilians. The protests were in response to Prime minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]]'s speech where he said that the Socialist Party lied their way into office. Furthermore, his speech revealed that in the four years he was in office, his party had not done anything of great importance.

Police threw gas grenades and used rubber bullets to shoot protesters. Picked and tackled by the police, protesters and non-violent civilians just passing by were injured by the police. Police broke the fingers of a handcuffed man, raided restaurants and bars to find radical demonstrators. Police brutality ranged from offensive language to physically attacking protesters. Reports show that brutality extended to bypassers, tourists, news reporters and paramedics.&lt;ref&gt;[[2006 protests in Hungary]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevention====
Rather than acting reactively, Hungary should work to improve their police training programs and work to provide ongoing training and assessments to ensure that police officers in the Rendőrség, are competent and fair in their ethical judgements when it comes to proportionality of a crime or situation and the use of force. The requirements to become a police officer in Hungary are: high school education, pass matriculation exam, and two years of police academy.&lt;ref name="hungarianspectrum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hungarianspectrum.org/2009/03/01/the-hungarian-police-force/ |title=The Hungarian police force – Hungarian Spectrum |publisher=Hungarianspectrum.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other countries around the world, the two-year program is shorter than Denmark (3-year program), and longer than Australia (33-week program) and the United States (18 weeks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policecareer.vic.gov.au/police/about-the-role/becoming-a-police-officer |title=About the Role &amp;#124; Police Members &amp;#124; Victoria Police |publisher=Policecareer.vic.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discoverpolicing.org/what_does_take/?fa=training_academy_life |title=Police recruit training and academy summary |publisher=Discover Policing |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current two-year program is quite lengthy, however time isn't the issue.  Most of what the Hungarian police academy teaches is academic theory; there is not much on practice.&lt;ref name="hungarianspectrum.org"/&gt; If practical work was given more attention in the Hungarian police academy, it is likely that the number of police brutality incidents will decrease.

{{see also|List of cases of police brutality in India}}
On January 23, 2017, [[2017 pro-jallikattu protests|a pro-jallikattu silent protest]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] turned violent. The [[National Human Rights Commission]] took note of reports that police used violent methods, including beatings and the damaging of private property, without prior warnings, to disperse of the protesters in [[Chennai]]. There were widespread social media reports of police setting vehicles on fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/police-excesses-on-jallikattu-supporters-in-chennai-nhrc-issues-notice-to-tamil-nadu-govt/articleshow/56761447.cms? |title=Police excesses on jallikattu supporters in Chennai: NHRC issues notice to Tamil Nadu govt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/jallikattu-nhrc-notice-to-tamil-nadu-government-police-for-excesses/|title=Jallikattu: NHRC notice to Tamil Nadu government, police for &amp;#8216;excesses&amp;#8217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/tamil-nadu-news/video-of-cop-setting-auto-on-fire-allegedly-in-chennai-goes-viral-1651853 |title=Jallikattu: Kamal Haasan, Others Tweet Video Of Cop Setting An Auto On Fire |publisher=Ndtv.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Lathi Charge" very well known in India which are an excessive use of force done by police during mass protests or riot are also considered as brutality done by law enforcement officials.

=== Indonesia ===
[[Islamic extremists]] in Indonesia have been targeted by police as terrorists in the country. Police may either capture or kill dissidents. Cases of police corruption with hidden bank accounts and retaliation against journalists who attempt to uncover these cases have occurred such as in June 2012, when Indonesian magazine ''Tempo'' had journalist activists beaten by police. Separately, on August 31, 2013 police officers in Central Sulawesi province fired into a crowd of people protesting the death of a local man in police custody. Five people were killed and 34 injured. History of violence goes back to the military-backed [[Suharto]] regime (1967–1998), from which Suharto seized power during an [[Indonesian killings of 1965–1966|anti-Communist purge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/17419881 | work=The Economist | title=Cop killers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal investigations into human rights violations by the police are rare, punishments light and Indonesia has no independent national body to deal effectively with public complaints. [[Amnesty International]] has called on Indonesia to review police tactics during arrests and public order policing, to ensure that they meet international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/indonesia-must-end-impunity-police-violence-2012-04-25|title=Indonesia|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
====Northern Ireland (UK)====

The legacy of police brutality has long plagued Northern Ireland, due to unsavoury police procedures used during [[the Troubles]] to obtain admissions of guilt. The Troubles in Northern Ireland lasted from 1968 until 1998, and was essentially was a civil war between those who wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom (unionists/loyalists, who are mostly Protestants) and those who didn't (Irish nationalists/republicans, who are mostly Catholics). During this time as many as 50,000 people were physically maimed or injured, a portion of which was done by the Northern Ireland Police (Royal Ulster Constabulary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/troubles |title=History - The Troubles |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instances of Northern Irish Police brutality were confirmed by the decision in 1978 of the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which concluded that five interrogation techniques used by the Police which included wall standing, deprivation of food, drink or sleep, subjection to noise and forcing detainees to remain in the same position for hours were instances of [[Cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and degrading treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/EUR45/004/2013/en/ |title=Document &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty International |date=2013-09-12 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 2010 however that such brutality was recognized by domestic courts, where 113 people came forward to have their application heard, some of whom were minors.

At present Northern Ireland still faces policing issues, though not to the extent of the Troubles. There are concerns about harassment by police of children aged 14–18 in low socio-economic areas of Northern Ireland which has led to a deep level of mistrust between the youth and the police.&lt;ref&gt;http://conflictresearch.org.uk/reports/policing/NIPB-PONI-Young-People-April-2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Catholics in Northern Ireland find that they are treated differently by police due to the police force being largely Protestant. 48% of Catholics that were surveyed in Northern Ireland reported harassment by the police. Instances of harassment include police officials spitting on individuals or enforcing laws in a discriminatory fashion, for example only to those who are Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;McVeigh, Robbie

====Republic of Ireland====
The Republic of Ireland's police force is called the [[Garda Síochána]] (Garda) and employs around 14,500 staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=5416 |title=About Us - An Garda Síochána - Ireland's National Police Service |publisher=An Garda Síochána |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland's criminal laws allow 'reasonable force' to be used by the police with regard to all the circumstances, which eludes to officers actions being proportionate in the circumstances.  Excessive use of force is unlawful however s76(7) of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 allows the following considerations when deciding on what force is reasonable.
A person acting for a legitimate purpose may not be able to weigh up the exact necessary action at the time or may act instinctively but honestly – in these instances the use of force may be considered reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.app.college.police.uk/app-content/public-order/core-principles-and-legislation/police-use-of-force/#the-criminal-law-act-1967-the-police-and-criminal-evidence-act-1984-common-law-and-the-criminal-justice-and-immigration-act-2008 |title=Police use of force |publisher=College of Policing |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is acknowledged by the Garda, who state; 'Unfortunately, even in the most civilised democratic jurisdictions, tragedies resulting from police use of force will continue to devastate families and communities.'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/GInspBarricadeIncidents.pdf/Files/GInspBarricadeIncidents.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of force by Irish Police officers has been of international concern, where the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture reported on this issue in the Republic three times in the space of a decade. Incidents that prompted this concern centred around the death of John Carty, a man suffering from mental illness who was shot by police, the prosecution of seven Garda police members due to assaults on protesters in 2002 and in 2005, a fifteen year old boy died after spending time in Garda custody. Given this state of events the Garda engaged independent Human Rights experts to conduct a review of the force, who found numerous deficiencies. The government responded by implementing new procedures based on this report. These include a new complaints procedure available against the Garda (Ombudsman Commission), disciplinary procedures and whistle-blowing protections.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, V &amp; Walshe, D  'Current Developments in Police Governance and Accountability in Ireland ''[[Crime, Law and Social Change]], Published online, 9 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latvia===

When addressing police brutality in [[Latvia]], it is important to look at the history of the country and how this affects its police and brutality towards the population. Latvia became an independent Republic in 1918 and attempted to develop an effective and accepted police force, moving away from the untrusted Russian Tsarist Administration. Despite positive post-independence aims to reform the police system and to maintain public order and security, the Latvian police were underfunded and under-resourced. The National Militia was created in response, being a voluntary force for the protection of public order.&lt;ref&gt;Melnis, E, Garonskis, A &amp; Matvejevs, A 2006, 'Development of the Policing in Latvia', ''Jurisprudencija''&lt;/ref&gt; Policing during this period was quite successful, being assimilated to what is today referred to as community policing.

From 1940 to 1991, Latvia was occupied by Soviet Union, and all previous regulations and practices were over-ruled by the Communist Regime.&lt;ref&gt;Melnis, E, Garonskis, A &amp; Matvejevs, A 2006, 'Development of the Policing in Latvia', ''Jurisprudencija'', Vol. 1, No. 79, pp. 72-84&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Soviet ideals on policing whereby criminals were the enemy, a high level of institutional secrecy existed and meant that there was no independent review of policing. More significantly, the approach of community policing was replaced with a militarised authority based on Marxist power ideologies. During this time, a clear imbalance existed between police actions and the rights of citizens. Despite lack of statistics, it is clear that police brutality was a major issue. This is illustrated by the case where former head of police Alfons Noviks was sentenced to life imprisonment for genocide against the Latvian people during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, I 2004, ''The countries of the former Soviet Union at the turn of the twenty-first century the Baltic and European states in transition'', Routledge, London, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, independence of the state of Latvia was again restored, which saw another change in the police system with the implementation of the Law on Police on June 5. This saw the restructuring of police forces into separate State, Security and Local Government levels. The Law on Police 1991 reiterated ethical requirements, whereby police officers were prohibited from performing or supporting acts relating to "torture or other cruel, inhuman or demeaning treatment or punishment". However, despite these reforms, issues regarding police brutality arose in light of the Russian population remaining in Latvia.  In 1998, police forces were accused of dispersing a rally of predominately Russian pensioners through the use of excessive force and brutality.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, I 2004, ''The countries of the former Soviet Union at the turn of the twenty-first century the Baltic and European states in transition'', Routledge, London, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; This hostility towards Russians remained in the proceeding years, and despite lack of official statistics, police brutality continued to be an issue after the independence of Latvia.

In 2005, the Latvian Center for Human Rights and Ethnic Studies (LCHRES) found a number of instances of brutality and "severe abuse" within police authorities, especially of persons in custody.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;U.S Department of State: Diplomacy in Action, 2006, Latvia, accessed 19 July 2016 &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61658.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Reports have shown high levels of corruption within Latvian law enforcement authorities, with 42 members convicted of corruption offences between 2003 and 2004.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; For the Latvian community, this means that should an incident of police brutality occur, they may not have an independent body to report to nor is it guaranteed to be handled impartially without corruption.

Latvian prisons illustrate cases where police batons were used to inflict serious harm to inmates, including causing broken ribs, which often were not medically assessed for up to two days. To address levels of police brutality, LCHRES conducted a study whereby it set up an anonymous hotline.&lt;ref&gt;Latvian Center for Human Rights and Ethnic Studies, Prevention of Torture, accessed 20 July 2016, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://cilvektiesibas.org.lv/en/projects/prevention-of-torture/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; During this four-day study, LCHRES received almost 300 calls and written complaints regarding police brutality and misconduct. This identifies fundamental flaws in the Latvian police authorities.

Since joining the European Union in 2004, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) has assessed the Latvian criminal justice system a number of times.  Whilst the CPT gives appropriate authorities recommendations for improvements such as a review board for ill-treatment, they found that in 2011, Latvian authorities had not enacted any of their 2007 recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, 2013, ''Report to the Latvian Government on the visit to Latvia carried out by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) from 5 to 15 September'', 2011, accessed 19 July 2016, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/news-2013/-/asset_publisher/TEHtOeUO1Ozc/content/latvia-should-address-ill-treatment-by-police-and-improve-detention-conditions&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their 2011 report outlined a number of cases of police brutality within the prison system, with ill-treatment allegations such as punching, kicking and a few cases of misuse of police batons and excessively tight handcuffing. This was alleged to occur mostly at the time of apprehension or during their time at the police station (including during questioning).

Despite the flaws within the Latvian Police system, CPT has found that the number of allegations for ill-treatment are decreasing over the years. The Latvian Police force operates under the Professional Ethics and Conduct Code of the State Police Personnel, which states "A Police officer shall use force, special facilities or weapon only in the cases stipulated by due course of law and to attain a legal aim.&lt;ref&gt;Latvian State Police, ''Professional Ethics and Conduct Code of the State Police Personnel'', accessed 20 July 2016, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.vp.gov.lv/?id=205&amp;said=205&amp;r=1&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of spontaneous or ill-intentioned force, special facilities or weapon shall not be justified." This identifies that the authorities are conscious of police brutality, and given more time, it is likely that the figures will continue to decrease.

=== Luxembourg ===
The Luxembourg Police force has 1,603 officers and is known as the 'Grand Ducal Police'. The Grand Ducal Police is the primary law enforcement agency in Luxembourg and has been operating since January 1, 2000, when the Grand Ducal Gendarmerie (previous Luxembourg military) merged with the police force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/memberpage/luxembourg-779 |title=Luxembourg &amp;#124; Partners &amp; Agreements &amp;#124; Member States &amp;#124; Europol |publisher=Europol |date=1958-01-01 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Luxembourg's relatively small population of approximately 500, 000 people the Grand Ducal Police are in charge of several duties that are often separated jurisdictions such as; Border Control and Internal Military operations.&lt;ref name="police.public.lu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.police.public.lu/fr/police-se-presente/1000-metiers/inspecteur/index.html |title=L’inspecteur de police - Portail de la Police Grand-Ducale - 1000 métiers en 1 |publisher=Luxembourg police |date=2016-04-22 |accessdate=2017-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110204044/http://www.police.public.lu/fr/police-se-presente/1000-metiers/inspecteur/index.html |archivedate=2017-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police brutality is not perceived to be a serious threat to society in Luxembourg. The European Union's 2014 Anti-Corruption report placed Luxembourg, along with Denmark and Finland, as having the lowest experiences of Police brutality within the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-86_en.htm |title=Commission unveils first EU Anti-Corruption Report |publisher=European Commission |date=2014-02-03 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to many positive characteristics of their society, such as freedom of media, the encouragement of public participation in the legal system and transparency mechanisms, the public also have great trust in the Grand Ducal police force.

Laws in Luxembourg specifically distinguish between coercion and force in the 1973 Act on Regulating the Use of Force.&lt;ref name="books.google.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Schengen_Investigated.html?id=YGbNgL-m20AC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Schengen Investigated: A Comparative Interpretation of the Schengen ... - Chantal Joubert, Hans Bevers |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |date=1996-06-03 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act regulates the use of police weapons and specific technical means of physical force used by police. However, this act does not cover other forms of physical coercion by police officers such as the use of handcuffs as these are seen as basic police measures that do not require specific legislation. The officer must be legitimately executing his duty and his actions and must be compatible under the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity, reasonability and measure in order to use force.&lt;ref name="books.google.it" /&gt; To ensure the Grand Ducal Police do not engage in police brutality numerous safeguards and prevention methods are implemented. The police inspector (which is the term for an everyday officer) must undergo legal and tactical training lasting an intensive 26 months followed by further training at an allocated police station.&lt;ref name="police.public.lu" /&gt; By way of comparison, the Victoria Police Academy only provides 33 weeks of tactical and legal training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?Document_ID=2 |title=Victoria Police - Delivering a Safer Victoria |publisher=Victoria Police (Australia) |date=2005-05-25 |accessdate=2017-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409041623/http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?Document_ID=2 |archivedate=2013-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 Human Right Report on Government practices by the United States indicated no cases of police brutality in Luxembourg. This report suggests the Grand Ducal Police have effective mechanisms in place to investigate and punish potential abuse and corruption.

Although police brutality is almost nonexistent in Luxembourg, there are effective procedures in place for the investigation and punishment of any potential misconduct by the Grand Ducal Police.

=== Malta ===
Malta's Police Force (MPF) is one of the oldest in Europe, with the Maltese government taking over the force in 1921, following the grant of self-governance. Currently, there are approximately 1,900 members in the Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mt/en/Services-And-Information/Business-Areas/Law%20Enforcement/Pages/Malta-Police-Force.aspx|title=Malta police force|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Police Act of 1961, Part V deals with the use of force, whereby "police officers may use such moderate and proportionate force as may be necessary…" (Article 96.),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&amp;itemid=8686|title=Chapter 164|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, according to Article 100., "It shall be considered as an offence against discipline if a police officer uses force for considerations extraneous to those permitted by law and the circumstances of the case".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As such, Malta does recognize the illegality of police brutality and can prosecute offending officials on these grounds.

Malta is expected to abide by the 2001 European Code of Ethics being a member of the [[European Union]], whereby "The police may use force only when strictly necessary and only to the extent required to obtain a legitimate objective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805e297e|title=Council of Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Council of Europe (of which Malta is a member) follows the five principles developed by the [[European Court of Human Rights]], whereby definition 16 states that police officers "may use reasonable force when lawfully exercising powers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?p=&amp;id=1417857&amp;Site=COE&amp;BackColorInternet=DBDCF2&amp;BackColorIntranet=FDC864&amp;BackColorLogged=FDC864&amp;direct=true|title=Commissioner for Human Rights – Opinion of the Commissioner for Human Rights, Thomas Hammarberg, concerning independent and effective determination of complaints against the police|last=Hammarberg|first=Council of Europe, Commissioner for Human Rights, Mandate 2006–2012, Thomas|website=wcd.coe.int|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Lawrence Gonzi (The Minister for Justice and Home Affairs) called upon Mr Martin Scicluna, a former civil servant and currently expert on security issues at the Prime Minister's Office, to conduct an independent inquiry into the 24 March 2008 police brutality incident. the inquiry required the investigation of "allegations of beatings carried out on detainees at Safi Detention Centre by members of the Detention Service on 24 March 2008 and to make any recommendations necessary in the light of [his] findings".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Following the results of the inquiry of Mr. Scicluna, made public by the [[Government of Malta|Maltese Government]], it was concluded that "excessive force was used by Detention Service Personnel".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Mr Scicluna made recommendations that "appropriate [action] should be taken to reprimand the Detention Service officers involved in this operation and the relevant Senior NCOs for the acts of 25 excessive force used by some personnel in their charge".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/documents/mlt/2011-05-inf-eng.pdf|title=Report to the Maltese Government on the visit to Malta carried out by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, Home Affairs Minister Carm Mifsud Bonnici has said "95 percent of the members of the police force were doing their duties, but the remainder needed to be addressed",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080706/local/cmb.215356|title=Police violence will not be tolerated – minister|last=Ltd|first=Allied Newspapers|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the establishment of the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU) to "maintain and safeguard the integrity of the Malta Police Force through an internal system of investigation that is objective, fair, equitable, impartial and just",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulizija.gov.mt/en-us/internalaffairs.aspx|title=Malta Police Force Portal|website=www.pulizija.gov.mt|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; where complaints or allegations on the use of force can be monitored and responded to.

Although Malta has attempted to tackle the police brutality through the implementation of independent systems such as the IAU, the [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]] 2010 report on Malta's human rights found that "authorities detained irregular immigrants under harsh conditions for up to 18 months during the review of their protected status."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.state.gov/md154438.htm|title=Malta|website=m.state.gov|access-date=2016-07-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719085153/http://m.state.gov/md154438.htm|archivedate=2016-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the 2013 [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]] report found that although there were no government reports of the use of brutality in detention centers, on December 2, 2013, media reported the sentencing of two former prison guards to five years prison and another two guards to three months prison after finding them guilty of beating an escaped prisoner in 2008, illustrating the gradual development of the IAU in limiting the use of police brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/220518.pdf|title=MALTA 2013 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the implementation of the IAU, The [[United Nations Human Rights Committee|Human Rights Committee]] has raised questions on the use of force by state officials with respect to the countering of detention center riots, where police have been accused of punching and striking detainees. An enquiry was consequently conducted in 2011 and 2012 following riots, resulting in criminal action against the law enforcement officials responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15167&amp;LangID=E|title=Human Rights Committee considers report of Malta|website=www.ohchr.org|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Giacomo Santini and Tina Acketoft (The Chairs of the Migration and Equality Committees of the Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]]) expressed "grave concern at an increasing number of incidents of state violence against migrants and refugees". They have called upon Maltese authorities to conduct a rapid investigation emphasising the need to stamp out violence against migrants and refugees, whether by state actors or by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=4044&amp;lang=2|title=PACE: News|website=assembly.coe.int|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination|The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] in relation to the conditions of migrants in detention, recommended that the "State party take appropriate measures to improve detention conditions and refrain from resorting to excessive use of force to counter riots by immigrants in detention centers, and also to avoid such riot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/A.66.18.pdf|title=The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|"Ta' Xbiex resident David Calleja, a financial advisor, had been driving in the Sliema Strand when he was stopped by police, who deemed him to be driving recklessly.
The Malta Police Force issued a statement detailing what had happened, in which it claimed that Mr Calleja acted aggressively, refused to take a breathalyser test, ignored police orders and used foul language.

He was subsequently arrested and taken to a police squad car, but according to the police statement, he kicked the driver, tried to escape and banged his head repeatedly against the car window. The police added that he even spit blood at police officers and bit a constable's arm, tearing off part of his skin.

When asked to state his client's plea, Dr Abela declared "absolutely not guilty," before accusing the police of grossly distorting the truth.

Mr Calleja's nose was bandaged, and Dr Abela presented a medical certificate showing that it had been broken as evidence. The lawyer also presented his client's blood-stained clothes – prosecuting inspector Jason Sultana originally objected, but relented after Dr Abela said that this objection was due to the fact that the clothes helped confirm the injuries Mr Calleja sustained."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-10-27/local-news/Lawyer-of-man-accused-of-biting-constable-claims-his-client-was-victim-of-police-brutality-6736124499|title=Lawyer of man accused of biting constable claims his client was victim of police brutality – The Malta Independent|website=www.independent.com.mt|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|20-year-old Lee Michael Robertson from Xemxija&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;
|"Robertson had been attacked whilst at the bar, and had injured his hand. He rushed to the police station, she said, but once he arrived he had been told to clear out of the station and wipe the blood off his hand before going back in.
In the ensuing verbal exchange the officer, Defence lawyer Rachel Tua said, made offensive remarks about the accused's father. Robertson was then allegedly thrown to the ground by the officer, who slammed the man's head on the ground, the lawyer said, also claiming that the accused had his injured arm cruelly twisted while he was being handcuffed. She denied the prosecution's assertion that Robertson had assaulted police, adding that his friends had witnessed the incident and would be summoned to testify. Tua told magistrate Vella that the police refused to allow Robertson to speak to her during his arrest, instead holding him overnight and taking a statement the next morning – with the police officer who allegedly delivered the beating present in the interrogation room. The police had not even told him why he was being arrested, she said."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/62317/paceville_brawler_alleges_police_brutality#.V5HMp1ewGJU|title=Paceville brawler alleges police brutality|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle East ===
Police brutality was a major drive behind [[2011 Egyptian revolution]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21574017-police-are-rotten-ever-what-happened-reform | work=The Economist | title=What happened to reform?}}&lt;/ref&gt; the incident of [[Khaled Said]]'s death and other stories, yet very little has changed since. One of the "demands" around which people decided to take it to the streets in Egypt is "purging the Ministry of Interior" for its brutality and torture practices.

[[File:Wattsriots-policearrest-loc.jpg|thumb|upright|Police arrest a man during the [[Watts Riots]], August 1965]]

The [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]] states have seen many cases of brutality, some even involving senior figures. For example, [[Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan]] a UAE sheikh, was involved in the torture of many business associates and he often recorded some of the abuse. Sheikh Issa was eventually arrested but a court found him not guilty and released him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=7402099|title=ABC News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International has also reported that a UAE worker was subjected to a wide array of torture methods during his time in jail, including beatings and sleep deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/08/uae-foreign-national-tortured-in-custody-and-detained-without-charge-for-a-year/|title=Error|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities in Saudi Arabia have also been filmed lashing civilians for different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/saudi-religious-police-dont-like-artists-who-harass-the-godly-self-and-have-long-hair|title=Saudi Religious Police Don't Like Being Filmed Beating People Up|work=VICE|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Netherlands ===
{{Unbalanced|date=March 2017}} 
The Netherlands is signatory to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;The European Convention on Human Rights, viewed online July 19, 2016

&lt;nowiki&gt;http://rightsinfo.org/the-rights-in-the-european-convention/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; detailing the limits and responsibilities of police powers, and as such demonstrates a public commitment to the restricted legal use of police powers. These powers include the use of reasonable force to enable the effective discharge of duties, with the stipulation force be used proportionately and only as a last resort&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The police force of the Netherlands is divided into 25 regional forces and one central force. A Regional Police Board, made up of local mayors and the chief public prosecutor, heads each regional force, with a chief officer placed in charge of police operations. Police accountability procedures include the mandatory reporting of any incident during the discharge of duty that requires the use of force. The Rijksrecherche is the national agency responsible for the investigation of serious breaches of police conduct resulting in death or injury. In 2007 the Rijksrecherche conducted 67 inquiries related to police officers, 21 of which were for shooting incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Lamboo, T 2010, "Police Misconduct: accountability of internal investigations' ''International Journal of Public Sector management,'' vol. 23, iss. 7, pp. 613-631.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Dutch society has a history of support for liberal values, it has not been immune to what can be regarded as a broader international trend toward the practice of racial profiling and increased levels of police violence towards racial minorities. Suspicion and mistrust of some racial groups is evident, and is perpetuated by police attitudes at all levels of command.&lt;ref name="Leun, J. P 2011"&gt;van der Leun, J. P &amp; van der Woude, M. A. H 2011, 'Ethnic Profiling In The Netherlands? A reflection on expanding preventative powers, ethnic profiling and a changing social and political context', ''Policing and Society,'' Vol. 21, No. 4, December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend in police behaviour has drawn comment from Amnesty International, which in a 2015 report describes Dutch law enforcement officers as having a tendency to correlate suspicious criminal behaviour with specific ethnic characteristics, most notably those typical of persons of Moroccan heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International 2015, 'Stop and Search Powers Pose Risk to Human Rights: Acknowledging and tackling ethnic profiling in the Netherlands', viewed online 19 July 2016 at {{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.nl/sites/default/files/public/amnesty_stopandsearchpowersposearisktohumanrights.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005115357/http://www.amnesty.nl/sites/default/files/public/amnesty_stopandsearchpowersposearisktohumanrights.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-05  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current political discourse in the Netherlands often supports the notion of inferiority of some cultures and is evidenced by the growth in support for far right political ideologies in recent decades.&lt;ref name="Leun, J. P 2011" /&gt;

Instances highlighting the convergence of racial profiling and the use of police force came to the forefront of public attention in the Netherlands in June 2015 with the death of Aruban man Mitch Henriquez. Henriquez died of asphyxiation while in police custody after claiming to have a firearm and being arrested at a music festival in [[The Hague]]. The first anniversary of his death in June this year provided a catalyst for protest against police brutality in The Hague, an area with a significant proportion of residents of non-European back-ground. Eleven protesters were arrested for failing to comply with instructions from the Mayor to limit protest to certain areas of the city, leading to some protesters to claim authorities were attempting to criminalize the right to peaceful protest. The five officers alleged to be involved in Mitch Hendriquezs' death have been suspended but are yet to be charged.&lt;ref&gt;Peiters, J 2016 'Police Chokehold Death Protested Blocked From Hague Neighborhood' Netherland Times, June 27, 2016, Retrieved July 18, 2016

=== Pakistan ===
{{see also|List of cases of police brutality in Pakistan}}
 Pakistan's law enforcement is divided into multiple tiers including forces under provincial and federal government control. The law strictly prohibits any physical abuse of suspected or convicted criminals, however, due to certain training lacks, there have been reported instances of suspected police brutality. Reported cases are often investigated by police authorities as well as civil courts leading to mixed outcomes. 
'''RECENT CASES'''
    A recent case includes the purported extra judicial killing of a man named Naqeebullah by an ex-officer named "Rao Anwar". Taking notice of the matter, the Supreme Court issued arrest and detention warrants in the case to arrest the accused.

{{see also|#Hong Kong}}
Politically motivated riots and protests have occurred historically in China, notably with the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. Within the past decade, groups such as [[Falun Gong]] have protested party measures and been broken up by riot police. Chinese dissidents have been able to arrange effective mobilization through use of social media and informal communication like [[Twitter]] and its Chinese counterparts [[Microblogging in China|Weibo]] or microblogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-04-30/asia/world_asia_china-chen-internet_1_sina-weibo-chinese-censors-chen-guangcheng?_s=PM:ASIA | work=CNN | title=Chinese censors block news on blind activist's escape – CNN.com | date=May 9, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614224358/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-04-30/asia/world_asia_china-chen-internet_1_sina-weibo-chinese-censors-chen-guangcheng?_s=PM:ASIA | archivedate=June 14, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign journalists from Switzerland have reported cases of [[police harassment]]. Media suppression has increased in the wake of the [[Tunisian revolution|Jasmine Revolution]] in Tunisia. Plainclothes policemen are often deployed during demonstrations to suppress violence. Censorship is often maintained as a measure to maintain political stability in China. Web activists can be charged by the police for using false identities to surf the Internet. After arrests, homes of the arrested individual are often searched for incriminating evidence such as computers, [[hard drives]], and [[flash drives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/china-police-violence-against-28-02-2011,39643.html|title=Police violence against journalists, invitations to tea – Reporters Without Borders|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
The Polish police force aims to 'serve and protect the people, and to maintain public order and security'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policja.pl/pol/english-version/4889,Polish-National-Police.html|title=Polish National Police|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish laws prohibit torture or degrading treatment and set out punishment for police officers including demotion and removal from the police force.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/220529.pdf|title=Poland 2013 Human Rights Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====

A key factor influencing the levels of police brutality in Poland has been the move from a communist state to a democracy. It is argued that Poland's transition has resulted in a more transparent system, decreasing levels of police brutality.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krasnokutski|first=Shannon|date=2001|title=Human Rights in Transition: The success and Failure of Polish and Russian Criminal Justice Reform|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1469&amp;context=jil|journal=Case Western Reserve Journal|volume=33|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although police brutality exists within Poland cases are much more likely to be handled by the criminal justice system with a greater chance for resolution through the courts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

This change can also been seen through the increased trust within the Polish police. While there are still instances of police brutality, trust in the police has steadily increased in Poland from 62% - 75% between 2002 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Tabitha|date=2009|title=The Distrust Paradox: Trust and Distrust in the Polish Online Press, Cross National Data Reports and Public Opinion Surveys 2002–2008|url=https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/indexablecontent/uuid:10615342-c372-4fd1-ac0f-71850ef328c2|journal=Thesis – University of North Carolina|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statistic demonstrates the improvement in trust between the police and general public.

Although there is a more open police force within Poland, many organizations still hold issues with police brutality within Poland. The 2013 United States Department of State report on Poland raised several issues of police brutality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The report cited a case of police officers using violence to gain a confession for armed robbery in 2012.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, it also noted that these police officers were eventually indicted for police brutality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Issues with sports fans====
{{see also|2015 Knurów riots|1998 Słupsk street riots}}
In recent years one of the main sources of controversy amongst Polish police brutality has been in the use of rubber bullets to disperse crowd trouble at sporting events.

In 1998, [[1998 Słupsk street riots|major riots]] occurred when a young basketball fan was killed by the police. In 2004, a man was killed and a woman injured in a riot when Polish police accidentally shot live ammunition instead of rubber bullets into the crowd after an association football game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100578.htm|title=Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Poland|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2015 Knurów riots|Another set of riots]] occurred in 2015 in response to a [[pitch invasion]] during a football match. Although rubber bullets were used, one man was hit on the neck and later died at the hospital.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A former Polish police officer justified this use of weapons as a means to combat [[football hooliganism]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newpolandexpress.pl/pdf_copies/newpolandexpress_305_2015-05-08.pdf|title=Football Fan Death Sparks Riots|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003180859/http://www.newpolandexpress.pl/pdf_copies/newpolandexpress_305_2015-05-08.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters have characterized the detainment of sports fans protesting against the government as unfair and undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/43/265/Artykul/370212,Kibice-Jagiellonii-zatrzymani-za-protest |title=Kibice Jagiellonii zatrzymani za protest - Sport |publisher=Polskie Radio |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Issues with Roma====

The Polish police also have a history of police brutality within the [[Roma in Poland|Roma community]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.errc.org/article/osce-meeting-statement-on-roma-in-poland/285|title=OSCE Metting Statement on Roma in Poland|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=European Roma Rights Centre|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple cases of police beatings and other discriminatory acts against Roma from Polish police.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The European Roma Rights Centre also argues that police investigations into police brutality cases are very rare with systematic police brutality against the Roma minority.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

One particular case of police brutality against Roma occurred in 1998 when the police took four Roma men to a field and beat them.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.errc.org/article/police-beat-four-roma-near-ciechocinek-poland/1558|title=Police Beat four Roma near Ciechocinek, Poland|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=European Roma Rights Centre|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the men that were beaten were charged with vulgar words and behavior in public this police brutality resulted in broken bones and hospitalisation. This incident demonstrates the need for further procedures in order to stop police brutality against Roma and the continued need for police checks to stop police misconduct.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Portugal ===
[[Portugal]] is ranked the fourth most heavily policed country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy |first=Niall |url=https://www.statista.com/chart/2987/the-most-heavily-policed-countries-in-the-world/ |title=• Chart: The most heavily policed countries in the world |publisher=Statista |date=2014-11-24 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police force is divided into five main organisations, with the [[Polícia de Segurança Pública]] (PSP) having the most prominent urban presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safecommunitiesportugal.com/police-in-portugal/ |title=Police In Portugal |publisher=Safe Communities Portugal |date=1945-10-20 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PSP has a diverse range of duties and responsibilities, which include protecting the rights of citizens and ensuring democratic legality.

The use of weapons by Portuguese police is permitted only when:

{{Quote|text="…absolutely necessary and when less dangerous means have proved ineffective, and provided that their use is proportionate to the circumstances"|author=''Decreto-Lei No. 457/99 Art. 2(1)'' |source=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pgdlisboa.pt/leis/lei_mostra_articulado.php?nid=1558&amp;tabela=leis |title=::: DL n.º 457/99, de 05 de Novembro |publisher=Procuradoria-Geral Distrital de Lisboa |date= 1999-11-05|accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This is severely restrictive. By way of example, police will not be permitted to use their firearms when an offender is running away.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jflmjournal.org/article/S1752-928X(15)00071-2/abstract?cc=y=&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal has recently been criticised for the excessive use of force by police. High profile incidents at football matches, as well as reports of racially motivated force used against minority communities, have highlighted the issue of police brutality in Portugal.

====Football hooliganism====

Portuguese police have adopted an aggressive position in combating football hooliganism. Despite appearing disproportionate, the police view the heavy-handed nature of their tactics as a necessary and successful approach towards community protection and maintaining social order.

In 2015, a viral video depicted a Benfica fan being heavily beaten in front of his two children outside a football stadium. The footage, filmed by a local television station, shows Jose Magalhaes leaving the football match early with his children and elderly father before being confronted by police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32793901 |title=Portugal police filmed hitting football fan in front of children|work=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the family appeared calm, Magalhaes was tackled to the ground by police and repeatedly hit with a metal baton, whilst his father was punched in the face twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press in Matosinhos |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/20/outrage-in-portugal-over-police-beating-of-man-in-front-of-his-children |title=Outrage in Portugal over police beating of man in front of his children &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; More police rushed to the scene to shield the obviously distraught children, aged nine and thirteen.

A statement released by the PSP acknowledged the controversial incident and announced that an investigation was launched against the officer responsible for initiating the attack.&lt;ref name="safecommunitiesportugal.com"&gt;http://www.safecommunitiesportugal.com/public-statement-by-psp-police-concerning-football-violence-at-guimarães-and-lisbon/&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the officer was suspended for 90 days by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/officer-caught-beating-benfica-fan-suspended-for-90-days/35214 |title=Officer caught beating Benfica fan suspended for 90 days |publisher=The Portugal News |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement also defended the policing of the large crowds in the aftermath of the football match. Riot police had clashed with supporters the following day in Lisbon as fans celebrated Benfica's title victory. The harsh approach was described as proportionate and necessary to prevent social disorder from escalating.&lt;ref name="safecommunitiesportugal.com" /&gt;

In a similar incident in 2016, another football club, Sporting Lisbon, complained about 'barbaric' police assaulting their fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com.au/sporting-cp/story/2876295/sporting-lisbon-complain-of-barbaric-assault-by-riot-police-on-fans |title=Sporting Lisbon complain of 'barbaric' assault by riot police on fans |work=[[ESPN FC]] |date=2016-05-19 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racism====

There have also been suggestions of institutionalised racism within the Portuguese police force, with activists claiming that discrimination is the deep-rooted cause of police brutality in Portugal.&lt;ref name="bbc.comThey hate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32419952 |title='They hate black people'|work=BBC News |date=2015-04-23 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2015/2016 annual report on Portugal, Amnesty International condemned the excessive force used by police against migrant and minority communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/portugal/report-portugal/ |title=Portugal 2015/2016 &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty International |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a good record in migrant integration, historical parallels can be drawn with Portugal's colonial past and modern police racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40394108|title=Portugal: A Determined Empire|first=Andrew|last=Marshall|date=29 May 1961|publisher=|journal=The World Today|volume=17|issue=3|pages=95–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to activists, police have killed 14 young black men since 2001, however, no police officer has been held responsible for the deaths.&lt;ref name="bbc.comThey hate" /&gt;

Racially influenced police actions are illustrated by the violence in Cova de Moura, a low socio-economic area housing a significant migrant population. Notably, during an incident in February 2015, a young man named Bruno was aggressively searched and physically abused.&lt;ref name="bbc.comThey hate" /&gt; When bystanders protested the excessive force, police responded by firing shotguns loaded with rubber bullets at the witnesses.&lt;ref name="bbc.comThey hate" /&gt;

On the same day, two human rights workers and five youth entered the [[Alfragide]] police station requesting information on Bruno's situation. Upon arrival, the group was allegedly attacked by police officers shouting racist slurs.&lt;ref name="bbc.comThey hate" /&gt; The policemen dragged and kept the young men in the police station, where they detained them for two days, mistreated and mocked them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reis |first1=Marta |title=Esquadra de Alfragide.

Eventually 17 police officers from the Alfragide police station went to trial on a variety of charges, including physical aggression, torture, document forging and aggravated kidnapping. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Costa |first1=Cátia |title=Juíza leva a julgamento 17 dos 18 polícias acusados de agressões |url=https://www.sabado.pt/portugal/detalhe/juiza-leva-a-julgamento-17-dos-18-policias-acusados-de-agressoes?ref=DET_relacionadas_portugal |website=Sábado |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2018, the trial was ongoing, with victims being heard in court. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Henriques |first1=Joana |title=“Os polícias davam socos, pontapés.

The [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] (ECRI) has expressed concerns about police mistreatment of minorities in Portugal in all of its reports on the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ECRI - Country monitoring in Portugal |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/portugal |website=CoE |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its fifth country report of 2018, ECRI mentions the Alfragide case in connection to the failure of IGAI ([[Inspeção-Geral da Admnisitração Interna|Inspeção-Geral da Administração Interna]]) or officers upper in the chain of command to stop the abuses. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ECRI REPORT ON PORTUGAL (fifth monitoring cycle) |date=2018-06-19 |publisher=Council of Europe |location=Strasbourg |page=26 |url=https://rm.coe.int/fifth-report-on-portugal/16808de7da |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, IGAI is the body responsible for scrutinizing police activities in the country, but it is part of the Ministry of the Interior, the same way Police forces are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apresentação |url=https://www.igai.pt/quem-somos/apresentacao |website=IGAI |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2018 report, ECRI recommends that such work be carried out by the country's [[Ombudsman]], an equality body, or by a new and (entirely) independent body that can be created for that purpose. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ECRI REPORT ON PORTUGAL (fifth monitoring cycle) |date=2018-06-19 |publisher=Council of Europe |location=Strasbourg |page=26 |url=https://rm.coe.int/fifth-report-on-portugal/16808de7da |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portuguese people of [[Romani people|Roma]] ethnicity have also been victims of police harassment and brutality in the country. There are several examples that have been publicized by the media. One such case is from 2007 and involved a Roma man and his son. The two walked to the [[Nelas]] police station, in [[Porto]], to get some information, but the police allegedly ended up abusing them. Two officers were convicted in 2011 for physically assaulting the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lusa |title=Dois agentes da PSP condenados por agressão a cigano |url=https://www.dn.pt/portugal/norte/interior/dois-agentes-da-psp-condenados-por-agressao-a-cigano-1876502.html |website=Diário de Notícias |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example of police brutality during raids of Roma camps or neighbourhoods, is the night raid of a Roma camp site by the GNR ([[Guarda Nacional Republicana]]), in [[Cabanelas]], [[Vila Verde]], in 2012. Some of the people living in the camp, including children and women, were reportedly attacked by GNR officers. The six Roma detained in the violent operation allege that they were later tortured and humiliated in the GNR station of [[Amares]]; the GNR denied the accusations, while [[SOS Racismo]] promised to file a complaint against this force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Silva |first1=Samuel |title=GNR acusada de "torturar" ciganos detidos numa rusga em Vila Verde |url=https://www.publico.pt/2012/09/27/local/noticia/gnr-acusada-de-torturar-ciganos-detidos-numa-rusga-em-vila-verde-1564830 |website=Público |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A last remnant of overt institutional racism, in Portugal, is article 81 of GNR's regulation law, which provides for an increased policing of nomadic people - who, in general, are known to be mostly Roma; the regulation's constitutionality was unsuccessfully challenged in the 80's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mendes |first1=Maria |title=Identidades, Racismo e Discriminação: Ciganos da AML |date=2012 |publisher=Caleidoscópio |location=Lisbon |isbn=978-989-658-160-2 |page= |pages=83, 84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===
Russian protests have gained media attention with the reelection of [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2012. Attention has been given to incidence of violence via posting videos online. President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] has initiated reforms of the police force, in an attempt to minimize the violence by firing the Moscow police chief and centralizing police powers. Police divisions in Russia are often based on loyalty systems that favor bureaucratic power among political elites. Phone tapping and business raids are common practice in the country, and often fail to give [[due process]] to citizens. Proper investigations of police officials still remains lacking by western standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/15731344 | work=The Economist | title=Cops for hire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Russia's top investigative agency investigated charges that four police officers had tortured detainees under custody. Human rights activists claim that Russian police use torture techniques to extract [[false confessions]] from detainees. Police regulations require quotas of officers for solved crimes, a practice that encourages false arrests to meet their numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/29/russia-police-torture_n_1387421.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Russian Police Charged With Torture In Deadly Rape, Death Of Detainee | date=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slovakia ===

Police brutality in Slovakia is systematic and widely documented, but is almost exclusively brought about against the Romani minority. The nation state itself has particularly racist attitudes toward the Romani minority, dating back prior to the split of Czechoslovakia. In fact, it is widely known that the government undertook, and still undertakes forced sterilisation of Romani women, and continues to segregate the Romani into walled-off settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.romea.cz/en/news/world/slovakia-internationally-criticized-for-forced-sterilization-police-impunity-for-brutality-against-roma-position-on-refugee|work=Romea|title=Slovakia Internationally Criticized For Forced Sterilisation, Police Impunity Against Roma|date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrimination has undoubtedly filtered down to the police force. Excessive use of force against the Romani minority by police has been publicly criticised by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/slovakia/report-slovakia/|work=Amnesty International|title=Slovakia 2015/2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police force has been repeatedly condemned by a number of organisations for lengthy pre-trial detention, and its treatment of suspects in custody.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, T (2013) 'Reflections on 1989 in Eastern Europe'  p 227, Routledge, {{ISBN|1-317-98039-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a 51-year-old Romani man died as a result of abuse in police custody at the hands of the Mayor of Magnezitovce and his police officer son. The victim, Mr Sendrei, was allegedly chained to a radiator and fatally beaten, after being forcefully removed from his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comparative Criminology|url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/rwinslow/europe/slovakia.html|work=San Diego State University|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415144947/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/rwinslow/europe/slovakia.html|archivedate=2016-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Whilst the mayor's son was immediately removed from the police force, and the mayor suspended from his position, he was reinstated just 4 months later. In response to this incident the minister for internal affairs attempted to establish new measures to prevent police brutality including mandatory psychological testing for law enforcement and better training around affective use of coercion.

However, police brutality toward the Roma minority remains a serious issue.

Graphic video footage shot by law enforcement officers in 2009 shows 6 Romani boys aged between 6-16 being forced to strip naked, kiss, and slap each other. It is alleged that the boys were then set upon by [[police dog]]s, with at least two sustaining serious injury. Officers attempted to justify their behaviour on the grounds that the boys were suspected of theft against an elderly citizen. However, [[cruel]], inhuman or degrading treatment by police, regardless of whether a crime has been suspected or committed, is prohibited under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/bernard-rorke/slovakia-roma-exclusion-and-dark-side-of-democracy|work=Open Democracy | title=Slovakia: Roma exclusion and the dark side of democracy|date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10 law enforcement officers involved have since been acquitted after the judge ruled the video inadmissible in court as it was obtained illegally. As the footage was the main piece of evidentiary support for the crime, without it a conviction was not achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.romea.cz/en/news/slovakia-scandalous-verdict-acquits-police-of-torturing-romani-children|work= Romea| title=Slovakia: Scandalous verdict acquits police of torturing Romani children|date=February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights watchdog's have raised concerns around police selectivity in making recordings of raids after a raid in the settlement of Vrbica in 2015 as they claim to have not thought the settlement would be problematic. This raid saw 15 men seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.romea.cz/en/news/world/slovak-ombud-says-police-raid-on-roma-settlement-was-unnecessary|work=Romea|title=Slovak ombud says police raid on Roma settlement was unnecessary | date=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often the experience of the Roma that on pressing charges in relation to police brutality, a counter- charge is often threatened by law enforcement, in an attempt to pressure the alleged victim into dropping the charges, which is particularly effective as the attitude toward the roma in Slovakia is so entrenched that lawyers are often reluctant to represent Romani victims.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, M (1999) 'Slovakia Since Independence: A Struggle for Democracy' p.137, Greenwood Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slovenia ===
While Slovenia is a fairly peaceful country, it is not without its faults. Minority groups in Slovenia, particularly the Roma and any residents from former Yugoslav republics face discrimination and sometimes brutality by Slovenian police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-AEXAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=police+brutality+slovenia#v=onepage&amp;q=police%2520brutality%2520slovenia&amp;f=false|title=Legitimacy and Criminal Justice: An International Perspective|last=Tyler|first=Tom R.|date=2007-10-25|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|isbn=9781610445412|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roma, in particular, are targets because of how stereotyped they are as an inherently criminal population.&lt;ref name="Lobnikar 191–209"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lobnikar|first=Branko|last2=Hozjan|first2=Urška|last3=Šuklje|first3=Tina|last4=Banutai|first4=Emanuel|date=2014-04-03|title=Policing a multicultural community: a case study of the Roma community in northeastern Slovenia|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01924036.2013.819025|journal=International Journal of Comparative and Applied Criminal Justice|volume=38|issue=2|pages=191–209|doi=10.1080/01924036.2013.819025|issn=0192-4036}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roma often live in illegal settlements in very low socio-economic conditions, which contributes to their discrimination and their reputation as criminals.&lt;ref name="Lobnikar 191–209"/&gt; The Roma are one of the ethnic minorities from former Yugoslavic states known as 'the erased' who, after Slovenia's declaration of independence in 1991, lost all legal status, social, civil and political rights.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; This made them particularly vulnerable to police brutality.

The police have been known to occasionally use excessive force against detainees in prisons, as well as foreigners and other minority groups, although no police officer has ever been arrested or charged.&lt;ref name="Lobnikar 191–209"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; This made them particularly vulnerable to police brutality. Their rights have still not been fully restored.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Due to their lack of rights and legal status, it is difficult to hold police accountable for offences committed against them.&lt;ref name="Lobnikar 191–209"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; It is argued that authorities turn a blind eye to any allegations that arise because often the victims are from ethnic minorities, and there is a culture of racism amongst parts of the police force.&lt;ref name="Lobnikar 191–209"/&gt; When investigations are made, they are often ineffective. Several cases have been brought before the European Court concerning people who have died in police custody because Slovenian Police used excessive force and failed to properly investigate it. Most of these cases are still pending and there has yet to be an outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/CP_Slovenia_ENG.pdf|title=European Court of Human Rights, Slovenia|publisher=European Court of Human Rights|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The worst case of police brutality was the November 2012 protests. Political dissatisfaction spurred a series of protests in Maribor, Slovenia. For the most part, the protests were peaceful.&lt;ref name="Why Slovenia is content no more"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20591820|title=Why Slovenia is content no more|website=BBC|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crowds were chanting and non-violently, and for about two hours on 26 November 2012 (also known as, "the second Maribor uprising") they remained that way.&lt;ref name="Why Slovenia is content no more"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=c4c_1353964969 |title=Protests in Maribor, Slovenia (Police Brutality)|website=liveleak|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, crowds moved towards an area with a heavy police presence and that's when the violence started.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnevnik.si"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dnevnik.si/1042565173/slovenija/zadnjic-je-v-maribor-notranji-minister-tako-priletel-ko-so-pocili-krambergerja/|title=Last in Maribor interior minister also flew when they are blasted by Kramberger (In Slovenian)|website=dnevnik|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police used excessive force to disperse the crowds, including tear gas, dragging and beating protesters, police dogs and even mounted police who indiscriminately charged into the crowd.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnevnik.si"/&gt; Civilians, violent and non-violent protesters, and journalists alike were all targeted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnevnik.si"/&gt; Authorities attempted to justify the use of force by claiming protesters were violent and the use of force was necessary, not excessive.

Since 2003, Slovenian authorities have attempted to rectify this discrimination by introducing a two-day training programme on policing in a multi-ethnic community.&lt;ref name="Pliceand Minority Groups"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.nl/sites/default/files/public/ainl_police_and_minority_groups__eng_0.pdf6|title=Pliceand Minority Groups|website=Amnesty International USA|access-date=2016-07-22}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme involved teaching police about Roma culture and their language which served to break down some of the stereotypes that caused tension.&lt;ref name="Pliceand Minority Groups"/&gt; The Roma were made aware of their rights, and the police were educated about national and international standards regarding treatment of minorities.&lt;ref name="Pliceand Minority Groups"/&gt; The programme involved teaching police about Roma culture and their language which served to break down some of the stereotypes that caused tension.&lt;ref name="Pliceand Minority Groups"/&gt; It also helped to build trust between the Roma community and police.&lt;ref name="Pliceand Minority Groups"/&gt; Tensions still exist between the two groups, especially concerning police who have not participated in this programme, however they have been greatly reduced.&lt;ref name="Pliceand Minority Groups"/&gt;

=== South Africa ===
{{see also|Marikana killings}}

Reports of police brutality skyrocketed by over 300% in just a decade, with only one in 100 leading to a conviction. There were also 720 deaths in police custody due to police action in 2011/2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/south-africa-police-brutality-increase|title=South Africa reports of police brutality more than tripled in the last decade|first=David|last=Smith|date=22 August 2013|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, due to the police committing crimes such as rape, torture and murder, the cost of civil liabilities claims were so great that there was concern the costs would strain the South African Police Service national budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/police-brutality-rise-south-africa-officers-accused-killing-raping-citizens-2122712|title=Police Brutality On Rise In South Africa: Officers Accused Of Killing, Raping Citizens|date=1 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain ===
Spanish police have developed a global reputation for brutality after images of clashes between demonstrators and police were spread on social networks and international news 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police Brutality Accusations as protests span Spain|url=https://www.rt.com/news/spain-valencia-protests-violence-931/|website=RT News|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two notable demonstrations are those that occurred in Barcelona on 27 May 2011, and in Madrid on 25 September 2012. Video footage made available online shows the use of force by police against peaceful demonstrators on both occasions. Images show officers using hand-held batons to repeatedly hit peaceful demonstrators, some of them in the face and neck, and the injuries caused. Police also used rubber bullets and pepper spray.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spain 2015/2016|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/spain/report-spain|website=Amnesty International|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in spite of public outrage the Spanish government has made no attempt to reform policing and police mistreatment of the public. On the contrary, in July 2016 new reforms to the law on Public Security and the Criminal Code came into force which limit the right to freedom of assembly and give police officers the broad discretion to fine people who show a 'lack of respect' towards them.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; The Law on Public Security also includes an offence of spreading images of police officers in certain cases. The UN Human Rights Commission has expressed concern at the impact this legislation could have on human rights and police accountability.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; Fines for insulting a police officer can be up to €600 euros, and as much as €30,000 for spreading damaging photos of police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain's New Public Safety Law Has Its Challengers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/world/europe/spains-new-public-safety-law-has-its-challengers.html?_r=1|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International identifies three main areas of concern about police action during demonstrations and assemblies: excessive use of force and inappropriate use of riot equipment, excessive use of force when arresting demonstrators, and ill-treatment of detainees in police custody.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

The 2014 report of Torture in the Spanish State found at least 941 people were tortured by law enforcement in 2014- both in the context of demonstrations and other public situations and in police stations and prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Al menos 961 personas sufrieron torturas en 2014|url=https://www.diagonalperiodico.net/28588-al-menos-961-personas-sufrieron-torturas-2014.html|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'The practice of torture is an everyday reality in Spain' claims Jorge del Cura, a spokesman for the Committee for the Prevention of Torture which collected 6621 complaints between 2004 and 2014. 'Day after day we receive information from people who have suffered all kinds of abuse and torture from stress positions, to push-ups, rape or physical assault.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Decade Of Brutality: Spain Police Raped, Tortured 6,600 People Between 2004 And 2014|url=http://anonhq.com/decade-brutality-spain-police-raped-tortured-6600-people-2004-2014/|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were only 752 convictions of police for mistreatment during this 10-year period. 
Pau Perez, an advisor to the National Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture notes that of the torture allegations made against police 50% were from people belonging to social movements and 40% were from immigrants- indicating these are the two groups who suffer most from police brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=España ha vivido desde 2004 más de 6.600 casos de tortura o malos tratos policiales|url=http://www.publico.es/politica/espana-vivido-2004-mas-600.html|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International and ACODI (Acción Contra la Discriminación) have both called out Spain for racial profiling and ethnic discrimination.&lt;ref name="https"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spain: Discrimination condoned by the authorities|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2011/12/spain-discrimination-condoned-authorities/|website=Amnesty International|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Watch: Challenging Police Abuse in Spain|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/case-watch-challenging-police-abuse-spain|website=Open Society Foundations|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ACODI documented 612 cases of racial discrimination in a single year, emphasising that many of these did not lead to official complaints because victims fear police retaliation or believe their complaints will be ignored.&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations.org"/&gt; This belief is not unfounded; in 2005 Beauty Solomon, an African American immigrant working as a prostitute, filed two criminal complaints against Spanish policemen for repeated harassment and physical assault. In spite of eyewitness testimony and medical reports confirming her injuries the Spanish Courts dismissed her claims on the grounds of insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations.org"/&gt; Solomon then took her case to the European Court of Human Rights, who unanimously ruled in her favour that Spain had violated Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination) of the European Convention of Human Rights. They also condemned Spain for failing to investigate both Solomon's assault and other racist and sexist acts of violence by police officers.&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty Solomon vs. Spain, discrimination based on race, gender and social status|url=http://www2.womenslinkworldwide.org/wlw/new.php?modo=detalle_proyectos&amp;dc=26&amp;lang=en|website=Women's Link Worldwide|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon's case is one of hundreds of similar cases in the ACODI report. Under Spanish law the police can check the identity of anyone in a public space when there is a security concern; however African and Latin American immigrant are most frequently targeted, and often without a legitimate security concern. "People who do not 'look Spanish' can be stopped by police as often as four times a day," said Izza Leghtas, an Amnesty International researcher.&lt;ref name="https"/&gt;

=== Sweden ===

Since the REVA (Legally Certain and Efficient Enforcement) project has been applied in Sweden in an attempt to deport illegal immigrants, it has exposed the brutal and illegal methods used by police. They harass and racially profile non-white Swedes who often live in segregated suburbs. The marginalised such as the poor, homeless, people of colour, users of illicit drugs and the mentally ill are facing Sweden as a Police State. This has resulted in social disobedience with ordinary people in Sweden updating others on Twitter and Facebook on the whereabouts of police.&lt;ref name="counterpunch.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/11/19/Swedish-police-racism-and-resistance|title=Swedish police racism and resistance|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====

In 2013 police shot a man in his own home in front of his wife in a town called Husby. The police said the man had been wielding and threatening them with a machete. The Stockholm riots, where more than 100 cars were torched, were set off after the Husby shooting. When the police showed up they had stones thrown at them. People said the police called them 'monkeys' and used batons against them in the clash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22622909|title=Riots grip Stockholm suburbs after police shooting – BBC News|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=en-GB|access-date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013 a Swede of African origin was refused entry into a local club in Malmo for wearing traditional African clothes. The police picked him up and in the process of his arrest his arm was broken and he was locked in a cell for nearly six hours with no medical aid. Socially excluded groups have been targeted and the result of police investigations often mean the police officers are not deemed at fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/27/Sweden-punishes-its-rioters-and-its-police-very-differently|title=Sweden punishes it's rioters and it's police very differently|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common denominator for people on a special police list is being or married to a Romani person. A register of 4029 Romani people is kept by police. The police say the document is a register of criminal people and their associates used for fighting crime in Skane despite people being on it that have no connection with Skane or any association with criminal people.&lt;ref name="counterpunch.org" /&gt;

In February 2016, in Malmo, a nine-year-old was accused of not paying for a railway ticket. The police asked the security guards to stop the child. One guard tackled him to the ground and sat on him. He then pushed the child's face into the pavement hard and covered his mouth. The child can be heard screaming and gasping on the video that has gone viral on the internet. The police then put him in handcuffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20150209/station-guards-accused-of-violent-assault-on-boy-9|title=Guards investigated after child 'assault' in Malmö|last=|first=|date=|work=[[The Local]]|access-date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gezi Parkı Müdahale 2013-06-11 (46).jpg|thumb|A protester shows his wounded eye. Police brutality was one of the main issues arising from the [[2013 protests in Turkey]].]]
[[Turkey]] has a history of police brutality, including (particularly between 1977 and 2002) [[Torture in Turkey|the use of torture]]. Police brutality featuring excessive use of tear gas (including targeting protesters with tear gas canisters),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2013/07/aftermath-unrest-turkey | work=The Economist | title=Tear gas as a dangerous weapon}}&lt;/ref&gt; pepper spray and water cannon as well as physical violence against protesters has been seen, for example, in the suppression of Kurdish protests and [[International Workers' Day#Turkey|May Day demonstrations]]. The [[2013 protests in Turkey]] were in response to the brutal police suppression of an environmentalist sit-in protesting the removal of [[Taksim Gezi Park]].

In 2012 a number of officials received prison sentences for their role in the death in custody of political activist [[Engin Çeber]].

The European Court of Human Rights has noted the failure of the Turkish investigating authorities to carry out effective investigations into allegations of ill-treatment by law enforcement personnel during demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/Pages/search.aspx#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-122885%22]}|title=CASE OF İZCİ v.

=== Great Britain ===
{{see also|#Northern Ireland (UK)}}

In 2015 the [[United Kingdom]] employed approximately 126,818 police officers in the 43 police forces of England, Wales and the British Transport Police, the lowest number since March 2002.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/police-workforce-england-and-wales-31-march-2015/police-workforce-england-and-wales-31-march-2015 |title=Police workforce, England and Wales: 31 March 2015 |publisher=Home Office |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation and treaties====

The Criminal Law Act 1967, Common Law and the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) set out the law and acceptable use of force in the UK. The use of unnecessary physical force is in principle an infringement of ECHR Article 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.app.college.police.uk/app-content/public-order/core-principles-and-legislation/police-use-of-force/ |title=Police use of force |publisher=College of Policing |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of force should be 'reasonable' in the circumstances. Physical force is appropriate if:

*it is absolutely necessary for a purpose permitted by law, and
*the amount of force used is reasonable and proportionate

This requires a consideration of the degree of force used. Any excessive use of force by a police officer is unlawful and an officer could thus be prosecuted under criminal law.

====Findings and statistics====

Since 2004/05, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) have published complaint statistics reports for England and Wales. In the 2014/15 annual report, the IPCC reported that there were 17 deaths in or following police custody and only one fatal police shooting in the last 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/annual-report-deaths-during-or-following-police-contact-201415-published |title=Annual report on deaths during or following police contact in 2014/15 published &amp;#124; Independent Police Complaints Commission |publisher=Independent Police Complaints Commission |date=2015-07-23 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures were more than doubled when the IPCC was first erected. The annual report for 2015/16 is due to be published on the 26th of July 2016. A total of 37, 105 complaints were recorded in 2014/15, marking a 6% increase to the previous year, and a 62% overall increase since 2004/05.&lt;ref name="ipcc.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Documents/research_stats/complaints_statistics_2014_15.pdf |title=Police complaints - Statistics for England and Wales 2013/14 and 2012/13 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations of 'neglect or failure in duty' accounted for 34% of all allegations recorded whilst 'other assault' and 'oppressive conduct' or harassment made up only 8% and 6% respectively.&lt;ref name="ipcc.gov.uk"/&gt;

====Public dissatisfaction and discrimination====

Despite an average reduction in deaths in custody since 2004, a 2014 Public Confidence Survey revealed that public satisfaction following contact with the police was falling and that there was a greater willingness to complain.&lt;ref name="ipcc.gov.uk"/&gt; The Metropolitan Police, who operate in some of the most ethnically diverse parts of the UK, received the greatest number of complaints in 2014/15 with 6,828. However, young people and people from black or minority ethic groups were much less likely to come forward with complaints.&lt;ref name="ipcc.gov.uk"/&gt;

Whilst instances of police brutality in the UK is comparatively less than its US counterparts, there are nonetheless high profile incidents that have received wide media coverage. As of 2016, more than 140 people from black or other minority ethnic groups have died under police custody from 1990. The use of excessive force has been used on an array of demographics of British citizens, however police brutality against ethnic and minority groups often attract wide media coverage. Whilst some have argued that this is discriminatory or evidence of institutional racism, others have asserted that it is largely due to over policing in areas that are perceived as high-risk areas such as Northumberland or Bedfordshire.

====Examples====

In 2009, [[Death of Ian Tomlinson|Ian Tomlinson]] was killed when he was hit in the head with a baton and shoved to the ground at the G20 protests in the [[City of London]]. PC Simon Harwood was an officer of the [[Territorial Support Group]] (TSG), a unit of the Metropolitan Police Service, until he was sacked for the altercation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-20821048 |title=Met riot police 'must reduce use of excessive force' |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident attracted criticism of both the "militaristic approach" of the TSG and the small number of complaints upheld by the Metropolitan Police despite referrals by the IPCC.

In May 2013, 21-year-old Julian Cole was arrested outside a nightclub in Bedford by six police officers. The altercation left Mr Cole in a vegetative state due to a severed spinal cord.

{{Main|Police brutality in the United States}}
In the United States, major political and social movements have involved excessive force by police, including the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1960s, anti-war demonstrations, the [[War on Drugs]], and the [[Global War on Terrorism]]. In 2014, the UN Committee against Torture condemned police brutality and excessive use of force by law enforcement in the US, and highlighted the "frequent and recurrent police shootings or fatal pursuits of unarmed black individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Nebehay (November 28, 2014).

Police officers are legally permitted to [[Use of force in law enforcement|use force]], and their superiors — and the public — expect them to do so. According to [[Jerome Herbert Skolnick]], in dealing largely with disorderly elements of the society, some people working in law enforcement may gradually develop an attitude or sense of authority over society, particularly under traditional reaction-based policing models; in some cases the police believe that they are above the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skolnick|first=Jerome H.|author2=Fyfe, James D.|editor=Winters, Paul A.|title=Policing the Police|year=1995|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego|isbn=1-56510-262-2|pages=45–55|chapter=Community-Oriented Policing Would Prevent Police Brutality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many reasons as to why police officers can sometimes be excessively aggressive. It is thought that psychopathy makes some officers more susceptible to the use of excessive force than others. In one study, police psychologists were surveyed on officers who had used excessive force. The information obtained allowed the researchers to develop five unique types of officers, only one of which was similar to the bad apple stereotype. These include personality disorders, previous traumatic job-related experience, young inexperienced or authoritarian officers; officers who learn inappropriate patrol styles, and officers with personal problems. Schrivers categorizes groups of officers, separating the group that most likely use excessive force.&lt;ref&gt;Scrivner, 1994: 3–6&lt;/ref&gt; However, this "bad apple paradigm" is considered by some to be an "easy way out". A broad report commissioned by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on the causes of misconduct in policing calls it "a simplistic explanation that permits the organization and senior management to blame corruption on individuals and individual faults – behavioural, psychological, background factors, and so on, rather than addressing systemic factors."&lt;ref name="RCMP Review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Loree|first=Don|title=Corruption in Policing: Causes and Consequences; A Review of the Literature|work=Research and Evaluation Community, Contract and Aboriginal Policing Services Directorate|publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police|year=2006|url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/PS64-27-2006E.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report goes on to discuss the systemic factors, which include:
* Pressures to conform to certain aspects of "police culture", such as the [[Blue Code of Silence]], which can "sustain an oppositional criminal subculture protecting the interests of police who violate the law"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/15614260290011309|last=Skolnick|first=Jerome H.|title=Corruption and the Blue Code of Silence|journal=Police Practice and Research|volume=3|year=2002|page=7|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "'we-they' perspective in which outsiders are viewed with suspicion or distrust"&lt;ref name="RCMP Review" /&gt;
* Command and control structures with a rigid hierarchical foundation ("results indicate that the more rigid the authoritarian hierarchy, the lower the scores on a measure of ethical decision-making" concludes one study reviewed in the report);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Owens|first=Katherine M. B.|author2=Jeffrey Pfeifer|title=Police Leadership and Ethics: Training and Police Recommendations|journal=The Canadian Journal of Police and Security Services|volume=1|page=7|year=2002|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Deficiencies in internal accountability mechanisms (including internal investigation processes).&lt;ref name="RCMP Review" /&gt;

Police use of force is not kept in check in many jurisdictions by the issuance of a [[use of force continuum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stetser|first=Merle|title=The Use of Force in Police Control of Violence: Incidents Resulting in Assaults on Officers|year=2001|publisher=LFB Scholarly Publishing L.L.C.|location=New York|isbn=1-931202-08-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A use of force continuum sets levels of force considered appropriate in direct response to a victims behavior. This power is granted by the government, with few if any limits set out in [[statutory law]] as well as [[common law]].

Violence used by police can be excessive despite being lawful, especially in the context of political repression. Indeed, "police brutality" is often used to refer to violence used by the police to achieve politically desirable ends (terrorism) and, therefore, when none should be used at all according to widely held values and cultural norms in the society (rather than to refer to excessive violence used where at least some may be considered justifiable).

Studies show that there are officers who believe the legal system they serve is failing and that it is their duty to pick up the slack. This is known as "vigilantism", where the officer involved may think the suspect deserves more punishment than what they may have to serve under the court system.&lt;ref&gt;Chevigny, P. (2008). "Police Brutality", In Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace and Conflict. oxford: Elsevier Science and Technology, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During high-speed pursuits of suspects, officers can become angry and filled with adrenaline, which can affect their judgment when they finally assault the victim. The resulting loss of judgment and heightened emotional state can result in inappropriate use of force. The effect is colloquially known as "high-speed pursuit syndrome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Mullen |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1996/04/05/EDITORIAL9376.dtl |title=The high-speed chase syndrome |work=SFGate |date=1996-04-05 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of Police brutality in America  ===
{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}

Police brutality is the misuse of power by police force to intentionally harm individuals. The excessive force imposed by police officers has grown dramatically over the past decade, causing social misinterpretations of the role that police officers play in the community.

''In 2015, the percentage of people who have confidence in the police hit its lowest since 1993 at 52 percent.[[Police brutality#cite%20note-%3A1-137|&lt;sup&gt;[137]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Of this 52 percent democrats saw the biggest drop in confidence. Democrats' confidence in police dropped 13 percentage points over the last two years compared with 2012–2013, a larger change than for any other subgroup. Over the same period, Independents' and Republicans' confidence in police has not changed. As a result, Democrats (42%) now have less confidence in police than independents (51%) and remain much less confident than Republicans (69%).[[Police brutality#cite%20note-%3A1-137|&lt;sup&gt;[137]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Most importantly however is the number of Black people that have lost trust in the police over the last two years: Black people's confidence in police has averaged 30 percent, well below the national average of 53% and much lower than for any other subgroup. Black people's confidence is down six points from 2012 to 2013, similar to the four-point drop among all Americans.[[Police brutality#cite%20note-%3A1-137|&lt;sup&gt;[137]&lt;/sup&gt;]]''

''The same study found that the number of White people who identify as democrat have lost the same amount of confidence in the police as Black people, as White Democrats' confidence declined 11 points over the last two years, similar to the 14-point decline among non-White Democrats the sample sizes are not large enough to break out Black Democrats separately, but the limited data suggest their confidence declined no more than that of White Democrats.[[Police brutality#cite%20note-%3A1-137|&lt;sup&gt;[137]&lt;/sup&gt;]] This decreased confidence in police officers is harming relations and affecting how many people deal with and respond to police which in turn leads to more hostility from police in the United States. This has also lead to many cities making police wear body armor and cameras on them at all times.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=CGI|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springerreference_61782|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The repercussions of police officers’ “excessive force“ of those who find themselves in confrontation with authorities are non-existent. Authorities have legal right over how the respond and treat suspects, police officers may justifiably escalate the use of force with mere commands… but commands from who? Therefore, police officers receive little to no punishment for willingly and forcefully hurting civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alpert|first=Geoffrey P.|last2=Smith|first2=William C.|date=1994|title=How Reasonable Is the Reasonable Man?: Police and Excessive Force|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1144107|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (1973-)|volume=85|issue=2|pages=481|doi=10.2307/1144107|issn=0091-4169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hands Up Don’t Shoot'''

The Constitution states that police officers are legally allowed to shoot in the instance that they feel the need to protect their lives or an innocent life or to prevent the suspect from escaping and posing a dangerous threat to the of bystanders in society. The Supreme Court Decision of [[Tennessee v. Garner]] made it possible to shoot a fleeing suspect ONLY if they may cause harm to innocent people so that authorities are not just shoot every suspect that tries to escape.

''In the United States there are one hundred sixty million more Caucasian people than there are Black people.[[Police brutality#cite%20note-%3A0-134|&lt;sup&gt;[134]&lt;/sup&gt;]] However, being thirteen percent of the country's population, Black people are twenty four percent of the number of people killed by cops as of 2015.[[Police brutality#cite%20note-%3A0-134|&lt;sup&gt;[134]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Due to the increased rate of the number of Black people killed by the police there has been an increased distrust of the police in the United States.''  

Society would like to believe that police officers and protectors are not biased towards the victims of police brutality, we hope that everything law enforcement does is to better protect us. As history repeats and more and more Black Americans lose their lives, this gives reason to believe that different geographic locations carry different political and social views, therefore police officers are biased towards those they decide to abuse, instead of allowing the justice system to properly serve justice.

'''Stereotypes'''

Lorie Fridell, Associate Professor of criminology at University of South Florida states that "racial profiling was the number one issue facing police [in the 1990's].” Which leads her to understand two things: “bias in policing was not just a few officers in a few departments and, overwhelmingly, the police in this country are well-intentioned.” The country as a whole sets stereotypes as well as biases against Black Americans which inevitably leads to social misinterpretation of the safety of Americans when a Black person is present.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32740523|title=Why do US police keep killing black men?|date=2015-05-26|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment done in Mekawi during 2014 conducted on White undergraduate female students suggests that there is a higher degree of fear of racial minorities which gives reason for authorities to believe racial minorities are dangerous, hence so many shootings of minorities. The  experiment exemplifies the dehumanization and lack of empathetic concern for minorities displayed by citizen of racial majority.

Incidents resulting in high profile deaths of innocent Black men such like Eric Garner in New York City, Tamir Rice in Cleveland, and Freddie Gray in Baltimore shows the Black community that they can no longer trust the police force. As a result of this lack of trust in police officers, the Black society have formulated many social organizations; founded in 2013, the [[Black Lives Matter|Black Lives Matter Movement]] made a social impact on the world in a response the violent and systematic racism that Black people still face by police officers.

While the Justice Department reported that Cleveland police officers used “excessive deadly force, including shootings and head strikes with impact weapons; unnecessary, excessive, and retaliatory force, including Tasers, chemical sprays, and their fists” on the victim, there was no real repercussions from their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hines|first=Sandra|date=2017-09-21|title=Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1332/policypress/9781447327868.003.0019|journal=Policy Press|doi=10.1332/policypress/9781447327868.003.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black Americans V. US Police Department'''

Another report released concerning the [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown shooting]] in Ferguson, Missouri, the Justice Department admits to the pattern of racial bias of the Police Department in Ferguson. The department argues that it is typically an effort to ticket as many low-income Black residents as possible in an attempt to raise local budget revenue through fines and court fees. The Justice Department explains, police encounters could get downright abusive when the person being questioned by the police officers gets disrespectful or challenges their authority.

In addition, The Department of Justice released a statement that confronts police officers’ susceptibility to implicit bias: One of the things they looked at is what they called threat perception failure. The officer believed that the person was armed and it turned out not to be the case. And these failures were more likely to occur when the subject was Black.

'''Statistics'''

''In the United States in the late 2010s there has been a increase in the number of police brutality cases. The number of deaths caused by a police officer have slightly increased from 397 to 426 deaths in the last reporting year which was 2013.[[Police brutality#cite%20note-244|&lt;sup&gt;[244]&lt;/sup&gt;]]''

In addition, In a study done by Research Triangle Institute in 2015, Arrest Related Deaths were ranked higher than Supplementary Homicide Reports in US deaths by approximately 4%. Police officers are killing more citizens at a higher rate than citizens are killing each other.

In the year of 2017 there were 1,147 deaths accounted for by police, 13 of which police officers were charged with a crime. 640 of the deaths caused by police officers that year, were responses to non-violent offenses and no crime was reported. 149 people killed by the police were unarmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://policeviolencereport.org/|title=2017 Police Violence Report|website=policeviolencereport.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, studies have shown that "Black people are three times more likely to be killed by police in the United States than White people. More unarmed Black people were killed by police than unarmed White people last year,” give. the fact that only 14% of the population are Black people.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;

== Investigation ==
In [[England and Wales]], an independent organization known as the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] investigates reports of police misconduct. They automatically investigate any deaths caused by, or thought to be caused by, police action.

A similar body operates in Scotland, known as the [[Police Investigations and Review Commissioner]]. In Northern Ireland the [[Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland]] has a similar role to that of the IPCC and PIRC.

In Africa, there exists two such bodies, one in South Africa and another one in Kenya known as the Independent Policing Oversight Authority.

In the United States, police are increasingly using police body-worn cameras during this [[The Age of Ferguson|Age of Ferguson.]] Since Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri, the US Department of Justice has made a call to action for police departments across the nation to implement body-worn cameras into their departments so further investigation will be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Investigation of the Ferguson Police Department|last=|first=|date=2015|newspaper=|access-date=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it is measured ==
Police brutality is measured based on the accounts of people who have experienced or seen it, as well as the juries who are present for trials involving police brutality cases. This is because there is no way to quantify the use of excessive force for any particular situation. Back is 1985 only one out of five people thought that police brutality was a serious problem. Police brutality is relative to a situation, it depends on if the suspected person(s) is(are) resisting. Out of the people who were surveyed about their account with the police brutality in 2008, only about 12% felt as if they had been resisting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bureau of Justice Statistics|title=Use of Force|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&amp;tid=703|website=Bureau of Justice Statistics|publisher=Office of Justice Programs|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although police force itself cannot be quantified, the opinion of brutality among various races, genders, and ages can. African Americans, women, and younger people are more likely to have negative opinions about police than Caucasians, men, and middle-aged to elderly individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jefferis|first1=Eric|last2=Butcher|first2=Fredrick|last3=Hanley|first3=Dena|title=Measuring perceptions of police use of force|journal=Police Practice and Research|date=2012|volume=13|issue=6|pages=81–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Independent oversight ==
Various community groups have criticized police brutality. These groups often stress the need for oversight by independent civilian review boards and other methods of ensuring accountability for police action.

Umbrella organizations and justice committees (often named after a deceased individual or those victimized by police violence) usually engage in a solidarity of those affected. [[Amnesty International]] is another organization active in the issue of police brutality. Amnesty International, also known as AI, is a non-governmental organization focused on human rights with over 3
million members and supporters around the world. The stated objective of the organization is "to conduct research and generate action to prevent and end grave abuses of human rights, and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated."

Tools used by these groups include video recordings, which are sometimes broadcast using websites such as [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=YouTube.com prompts police beating probe |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2645350&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |agency=Associated Press |last=Veiga |first=Alex |date=November 11, 2006 |accessdate=2006-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130233223/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2645350&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |archivedate=November 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilians have begun independent projects to monitor police activity in an effort to reduce violence and misconduct. These are often called "Cop Watch" programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Policing the Police: Civilian Video Monitoring of Police Activity|url=http://theglobaljournal.net/group/global-minds/article/643/|publisher=[[The Global Journal]]|last=Krupanski|first=Marc|date=March 7, 2012|accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper supervision by competent police supervisors and administration can reduce police misconduct.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 192-063, KZ Mauthausen, Erschossener Häftling.jpg|thumb|250px|A prisoner who was shot and killed at [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]]]]
The '''''Postenpflicht''''' ("Duty of Guards") was part of a written order for [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] guards in [[Nazi concentration camp]]s regarding the use of firearms. It required SS guards to shoot prisoners who tried to escape or engage in resistance and to do so without verbal warning or a warning shot. This was relevant for example regarding the so-called "death strip" next to camp fences. The area next to these fences was off-limits and anyone getting too close to it was, in accordance with the Postenpflicht, killed without warning. The order stated that failure to shoot would result in the dismissal or arrest of the guard. Issued on October 1, 1933 as an order for Dachau, the order was later extended to other camps.

He was instructed by [[Heinrich Himmler]], Munich chief of police and [[Obergruppenführer]] of the SS, to draw up a set of regulations for discipline in the camp. The rules were extremely harsh and several prisoners died as a direct result of their punishment.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The Munich prosecutor's office, not yet [[Gleichschaltung|fully in line]] with [[National Socialist]] policy, in May 1933, began investigating the murder of several prisoners at [[Dachau concentration camp]], prompted by the formal complaint of Sophie Handschuh, who wanted to know the true cause of her son's death at Dachau.&lt;ref name="Klee"&gt;Ernst Klee, ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich'', Frankfurt am Main (2007) p. 648 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter of June 2, 1933, Munich District Court Prosecutor II to the State Ministry of Justice: Subject: "Death of [[protective custody]] prisoners at Dachau concentration camp." {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=July 2012}} Rumors were already widespread about harsh treatment of those under detention and Himmler was forced to refute those claims, even while announcing the opening of Dachau.&lt;ref name="dachau1" /&gt; Charges of murder were filed against Wäckerle and Himmler was forced to remove Wäckerle.

== New camp order ==
[[Theodor Eicke]] was commissioned to develop a new camp order and a new regulations handbook.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Disciplinary procedures were added later to the regulations called the "Inspection of the concentration camps".&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the ''postenpflicht'' with instructions to fire on prisoners immediately and "without warning". Refusal to obey this order would bring serious consequences for camp personnel: summary dismissal and even arrest.

Together, the regulations allowed guards to mete out harsh punishments for even minor infractions and gave them wide latitude to execute prisoners and over time, devolved into a general system of terror punishment.&lt;ref name="sofsky"&gt;Wolfgang Sofsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rf1VqMP3gMsC&amp;dq=the+order+of+terror+the+concentration+camp&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RHvpS9fkIs6bON358I0L&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Order of Terror: The Concentration Camp''] Translated by William Templar.

The perimeter of the detention camp grounds was marked by electrified fences and walls. Alongside the wall was a moat and next to that was an area called the "neutral zone".  Dubbed the "death strip" by prisoners, it was a forbidden area. A prisoner who even went near this area risked being shot by a guard invoking the ''postenpflicht''. Guards who shot a prisoner received a bounty and three days off. Guards, for their amusement and profit, would throw a prisoner's cap into the "death zone" and order the prisoner to get it "on the double" and then shoot the prisoner.&lt;ref name="wollheim"&gt;[http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/en/wachmannschaften_en "Guard Details"] Wollheim Memorial official website.

Prisoner work details outside a concentration camp were called ''Außenkommandos'' ("outside commandos") by the SS. The SS guards would form a ''postenkette'', a [[Kettling|cordon]] of guards to surround the work site and maintain watch. The imaginary boundary formed by the cordon was not to be crossed by a prisoner. Stepping outside the boundary was treated as an escape attempt and the guards, adhering to the ''postenpflicht'', were to fire without warning.&lt;ref name="wollheim" /&gt; If a prisoner did manage to escape, the SS guard was charged with "negligent release of a prisoner".

The ''postenpflicht'' was also valid for the [[SS-Totenkopfverbände]] that came to the concentration camps to serve as guards and auxiliary police.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Not just the SS-Death's Head Units, but also other SS men were employed as concentration camp guards, especially around the end of the war.&lt;/ref&gt; During the war years, [[Female guards in Nazi concentration camps|female guards]] were also employed at concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Barton, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/THE+SHE+DEVILS%3B+Recorded+for+history:+The+women+of+Hitler's+death+...-a0139004839 "The She Devils; Recorded for history: The women of Hitler's death camps who tortured, maimed and murdered with glee"] From ''The Daily Mail'', London, England (November 22, 2005) Retrieved May 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As overseers, they were also ordered to use their firearms in the case of physical attack by a prisoner or an escape attempt.

Reich Minister of Justice [[Franz Gurtner]] was in contact with [[Reichsführer-SS]] Himmler to mitigate the ''postenpflicht'' a bit, but he was unable to accomplish anything.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Sydnor, Jr., [https://books.google.com/books?id=QYU4QJsUWLYC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=gürtner+himmler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-CsC_Du6jL&amp;sig=5J6PX9ByB5nP19XMn2VQtZ2chuo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YQrqS42HEsmmOMP5seQK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Soldiers of destruction: the SS Death's Head Division, 1933-1945"] See footnote, p. 20. Princeton University Press (1977) {{ISBN|0-691-05255-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camp commandants were also held accountable to the ''postenpflicht''. [[Karl Otto Koch]] was commandant at [[Majdanek concentration camp]] and on July 14, 1942, during his tenure, 200 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] escaped. Only half were later recaptured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holocaust-history.org/short-essays/majdanek.shtml "Majdanek"] Retrieved May 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1942, Koch was charged with "negligent release of a prisoner" and was reprimanded with a disciplinary transfer to the lesser job of ''[[Postschutz]]'' in [[Eger]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee, ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich: Wer war was vor und nach 1945.'', Frankfurt am Main (2007) p. 323 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Segev ''Die Soldaten des Bösen.

A guard who does not comply with this order should expect his immediate dismissal. Besides, he who "keeps his back free"&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The original German is an idiom. To "keep one's back free" (''den Rücken freihalten'') means to get the grunt work out of the way so one is freed up for more important things.&lt;/ref&gt; will rarely be attacked.''

''In the event of a revolt or organized prisoner resistance, every guard supervising is to fire upon them. Warning shots are strictly prohibited.''&lt;ref name="stan" /&gt;

The Morgan is part of the [[RepRap project]] and has an unusual [[SCARA]] arm design.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.htxt.co.za/2015/09/30/morgan-3d-printers-are-a-labour-of-love-inspired-by-the-internet/|title=Morgan 3D Printers are a labour of love inspired by the internet|last=Lotz|first=Brendyn|date=2015-09-30|website=htxt.africa|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Morgan printer was designed by [https://za.linkedin.com/in/quentinharley Quentin Harley], a [[South Africa]]n engineer (working for [[Siemens]] at the time) at the House4Hack Makerspace in [[Centurion, Gauteng|Centurion]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/will-this-100-reprap-be-the-device-that-takes-3d-printing-to-the-masses/|title=Will this $100 RepRap be the device that takes 3D printing to the masses? {{!}} ZDNet|last=Oxford|first=Adam|website=ZDNet|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SCARA]] arm design was developed due to the lack of access to components of existing 3D printer designs in South Africa and their relatively high cost.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2013 the Morgan won the HumanityPlus Uplift Personal Manufacturing Prize and third place in the Gauteng Accelerator Program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://humanityplus.org/projects/the-uplift-prize/|title=Humanity+  » The Uplift Prize|website=humanityplus.org|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.htxt.co.za/2013/12/08/reprap-morgan-wins-third-prize-in-gauteng-accelerator-programme-awards/|title=RepRap Morgan wins third prize in Gauteng Accelerator Programme awards|last=adamoxford|date=2013-12-08|website=htxt.africa|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morgan name comes from the RepRap convention of naming printers after famous deceased biologists.  The Morgan printers was named after [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]].  He worked on the genome of the common fruitfly with his wife, [[Lilian Vaughan Morgan]].  Their names were used in the development codenames for the first two generations of Morgan 3D Printers.

Morgan printers are now manufactured full-time by the inventor in a small workshop factory in the House4Hack makerspace.

The '''Research Diagnostic Criteria''' (RDC) are a collection of influential [[psychiatric]] diagnostic criteria published in late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Spitzer"&gt;Spitzer RL, Robins E (1978). [http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/35/6/773 Research diagnostic criteria: rationale and reliability] Archives of General Psychiatry, vol. 35, no6, pp. 773-82 {{PMID|655775}}&lt;/ref&gt; As psychiatric diagnoses widely varied especially between the USA and Europe, the purpose of the criteria was to allow diagnoses to be consistent in psychiatric research. 

Some of the criteria were based on the earlier [[Feighner Criteria]], although many new disorders were included; "The historical record shows that the small group of individuals who created the Feighner criteria instigated a paradigm shift that has had profound effects on the course of American and, ultimately, world psychiatry."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=102104 The Development of the Feighner Criteria: A Historical Perspective]  Kenneth S.

'''Rights-based approach to development''' is an approach to development promoted by many [[List of development aid agencies|development agencies]] and [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) to achieve a positive transformation of power relations among the various development actors. This practice blurs the distinction between [[human rights]] and [[economic development]]. There are two stakeholder groups in rights-based development—the rights holders (who do not experience full rights) and the duty bearers (the institutions obligated to fulfill the holders' rights). Rights-based approaches aim at strengthening the capacity of duty bearers and empower the rights holders.{{sfn|Gneiting 2009|p=1}}

==History==

===Human rights into development discourse===
Human rights came into global discourse after the [[United Nations]] passed the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948. This was the first global recognition that all humans are inherente United Nations endorsement of democracy had little to do with the UN's stance on development.{{sfn|Forsythe|1997|p=336}}  [[Human rights]] became one of the major debates between the West and Communist states during the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Hamm|2001|p=1006}}  Cold War dichotomy of right versus left defined power of the state and of the individual in aspects of society based on political affiliation.{{sfn|Harris-Curtis|2003|p=559}}  The end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet bloc left Western values and ideas, which remains one of the main ideologies of the world.

Human rights organizations such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], used to focus primarily on documenting human rights violations on the civil and political level. No longer do these organizations focus solely on human rights violations, but also on social, economic, and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.hrw.org/en/node/75134 Our History]". Human Rights Watch.&lt;/ref&gt;  The evolution of human rights organizations and development organizations and the western idea that rights are asserted through responsibilities, duties, transparency, trust, and accountability have led to the development of the rights-based approach. In 1993 the UN held the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna; during this conference they developed the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], where they linked democracy, human rights, sustainability and development.{{sfn|Hamm|2001|p=1007}}  This made the [[Cold War]] division of Civil and Political Rights and Economic Social and Cultural rights interdependent. This further led to the linkage between [[human rights]] and [[Economic development|development]] and enabled policy makers and developers to incorporate a rights-based approach into their policies.

In 1997, the Secretary General to the United Nations called to mainstream [[human rights]] into all work of the [[United Nations]]. Then in 2003, various organizations and agencies met to develop a "Common Understanding" of a human rights-based approach.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|pp=17–18}}  Giving six main principles:
* Universality and Inalienability
* Indivisibility
* Inter-Dependence and Inter-Relatedness
* Equality and Non-Discrimination
* Participation and Inclusion
* Accountability and Rule of Law

The [[United Nations]] developed this guide to address the significant changes occurring in the [[international development]] community with the adoption of human rights in development work. Since the UN published their standards and steps to a rights-based approach to development, many bilateral donor agencies, such as [[Canadian International Development Agency|CIDA]] and [[DFID]], and international NGOs such as [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]] and [[Oxfam]] have taken similar steps.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=15}}

===Transition away from welfare model===
The [[Welfare state|welfare model]] has been rooted into Western developmental practices since the 20th century.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=270}}  In the welfare model, poverty is defined as the absence of a public good or knowledge. If the state or another vehicle, such as an NGO, provides the absent good, then poverty can be alleviated and development will occur.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=270}}  Billions of dollars have been poured into this approach, however despite some achievements there has not been success with this model. The gap between the rich and poor is widening and according to the ''World Development Report'', nearly half of the world's population live on less than $2 a day.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=270}}

This model lacks a way to hold governments accountable for their actions or inaction. It fails to address governments' inability to fulfill their citizens' rights either because of funding or knowledge. It also constructs the poor as objects of charity, predetermining their roles in civic society.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=271}}

Due to the failures of the [[welfare state|welfare model]], NGOs reevaluated and transitioned more towards a rights-based approach to development. In this model, instead of the poor being constructed as charity they would be constructed as actors or rights holders. The NGOs' role is to help the poor overcome obstacles blocking their rights and give governments the tools and training to provide these rights.

==Theories==

===Human rights===
The inclusion of human rights into development discourse has also brought along a certain language of rights. This brings a moral resonance to development rhetoric and makes it hard to avoid in today's discourse. Rights are defined as entitlements that belong to all human beings regardless of race, ethnicity, or socio-economic class;{{sfn|Nussbaum|1998|p=273}}  all humans, therefore, are rights holders, and it is someone’s duty to provide these rights. Who is responsible to give these rights, in other words the duty bearers, has been largely debated. In rights-based approach it is the person’s government that assumes the duty bearer position, but most of the time the said government does not have the resources to fulfill this role. This is where the NGOs come and try to help these governments fulfill their roles and duties to their people by giving them resources. These resources can be monetary or more sustainable such as training to government officials.

Currently there is an under-fulfillment of human rights, which has been directly linked with poverty.{{sfn|Pogge|2005|p=1}}  Poverty includes the assessment of standard of living, health, and well being. These are social and economic human rights,&lt;!-- It is a bit misleading to use the terms of first and second generation rights. It has been agreed in the Vienna declaration that Human Rights are Indivisible, Interdependent and Interrelated, and thus cannot be separated into a categorization of generations, which can lead people to interpret as first, second and third priorities. (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Declaration_and_Programme_of_Action#Human_Rights_as_Indivisible.2C_Interdependent_and_Interrelated)

Also, to elaborate, I quote the UN Chronicle (https://unchronicle.un.org/article/international-human-rights-law-short-history):
"After the fall of the Berlin Wall, it became generally accepted that such a dichotomy does not do justice to the extent to which these rights are interrelated and interdependent. The dichotomy of positive/negative obligations no longer holds water. It seems much more useful to regard all rights as interdependent and indivisible, and as potentially entailing a variety of obligations on the State. These obligations may be categorized as the duty to respect, protect, promote and fulfil."

I will therefore suggest that these terms are removed from this article. --&gt;which have just recently been included in development discourse.{{sfn|Sen|2004|p=316}}  First generation rights, or [[civil and political rights]], have dominated public policy in the past. However, with poverty on the rise and public policy failing, social and economic rights are becoming increasingly important in development of policies.

Affluent or rich countries feel they should help the poor out of charity or humanity.{{sfn|Pogge|2005|p=4}}  Rights-based approach works to shift the paradigm away from [[charity (virtue)|charity]] and towards moral duty imposed on the world through the international consensus of [[human rights]]. NGOs are adopting the “full spectrum” of human rights into their development policies. Using human rights as their driving force they are using rhetoric to develop a [[modus operandi]] that made political human rights effective.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003|p=2020}}

===Capacity building===
[[Capacity building]] is the ability of individuals, institutions, and societies to perform functions and solve problems.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=20}}  A goal of rights-based approach to development is to increase the capacity of both the duty bearers and the rights holders.

Key principles to increase capacity are sought to build upon existing capacities, ensure national engagement and ownership, and adjust to countries' needs as development occurs.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=21}}  In this method, the duty bearers and the rights holders both have an active role in development. The duty bearers are accountable for respecting, protecting, and fulfilling human rights; while the rights holders need to ask what they should do to help promote and defend their freedoms. This action keeps their governments accountable for creating sustainability.{{sfn|Sen|2004|p=339}}

Capacity building is an ongoing process, and is often [[Social capital|intangible]]. This is why many [[nonprofit organizations]] have not been able to engage or transition more towards capacity building. Donors like to see tangible results or they like to see where their money is going. Also the success of nonprofit and NGOs is shown through [[tangible]] results, leading organizations more toward service delivery than capacity building.

===International law===
The international recognition of human rights has been largely debated; there is acknowledgment but not institutional enforcement. NGOs that use a rights-based approach in policy decisions have a large problem with gaining legal status or enforcement of the human rights they are defending. They rely on publicly criticizing countries who make these violations.

There have been many international legal documents developed by the United Nations on behalf of human rights issues that all members of the UN have to abide by.

* [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|The Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)]]
* [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|The Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)]]
* [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|The Convention on Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD)]]
* [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|The Convention on Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)]]
* [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|The Convention on Rights of the Child (CRC)]]
* [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|The Convention Against Torture (CAT)]]
* [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families|The Convention on Migrant Workers and Their Families (MWC)]]

Since the 1948 adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] the international community has developed a legally binding framework for the protection of human rights. These legal documents have created norms and standards internationally.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|pp=2–3}}

===Social contract theory===
The [[social contract]] theory proclaims that rights such as [[life]], [[liberty]], and [[property]] belong to the individuals and not to society.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=276}}  These rights existed before individuals entered civil society and by entering [[civil society]], one is agreeing to a social contract. In this contract, the state has the right to enforce [[natural rights]]. The state breaks this contract if the rights of the people are broken or not secured. Today, social contracts come in the form of national constitutions, which provide rules explaining and protecting individual rights.

These rights are inherent, they are not granted by authority or any overriding principle. [[Human rights]] are recognized by all people making it universal and fundamental.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=277}}

===Downward accountability===
Within the realm of rights-based approach there is a theoretical relation to downward accountability in relation to [[Economic development|development]].  This theory states what the rights are, who deserves the rights and what actors are responsible for ensuring these rights are secured.  In development there is a focus on the responsibility of actors.  Therefore, in relation to downward accountability it creates a power dynamic in development aid.   NGDOs (non-governmental development organizations) focus on downward accountability to ensure the intended beneficiaries are being allowed their rights.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dwyer 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Since the mid-1990s there has been a trend for NGOs and development donor agencies to combine the idea of development and [[human rights]] into the human rights-based approach to development.  Although there has been an undertone of development within the association with human rights earlier than this time; it has been since the end of the 20th century when there were known links of combining development and human rights into the same efforts.  This practice includes NGOs that are geared towards development as well as human rights.  The donor agencies are now helping to fund this combination of human rights with development to become as effective as possible. Even human rights-based approach to development theories were involved with the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs).  MDGs are the goals set forth by the UN member states to work for the alleviation of extreme poverty, fighting of disease, and other global problems.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

There have been 3 growing trends in relation to NGOs and the rights-based approach to development that have been implemented into practice.  The first trend is focusing attention onto a rights-based approach to development.  The second trend is the joint advocacy by development NGOs and human rights NGOs to work together towards a common goal.  The third trend is to expand the attention to economic and social rights as well.  The Human Rights ideal imparts the international benchmark that states can have related and common ideas.  To have internationally understood human rights allows NGOs, governments, and corporations to be held accountable for their actions.  This change in focus on human rights-based approach to development challenges the market-dominated view that was popular during the 1980s into a view focused on the relationship between human rights and development.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003|p=2020}}

These new trends have a significant impact and a possible paradigm shift.  From looking at development as a gift turning to development as a human right puts the responsibility on the government.  However, this is not just the home country, the responsibility of development resides in the hands of wealthy countries as well. To switch to a rights-based approach to development would then lead to using internationally agreed upon human rights as a responsibility of governments to provide.  Within this theory development will no longer be viewed as a gift or a need, but rather a right that states and governments are held accountable for.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003}}

===NGOs, UN agencies, donor agencies and specific programs===

====NGOs involvement====

NGOs that have implemented rights-based approach to development have done so with four main principles to follow.  These principles are human rights-based approach design of their programs, [[education]] about rights-based approach, rights to participation, and accountability.  Human rights-based approach design of their programs begins with analysis of the unfulfilled [[human rights]].  It then commits programs and funds to fulfill these missing human rights.  The design of these programs also stresses that the donations are not a gift but rather that the people are finally receiving the human rights treatment they deserve.  Education of human rights and the programs that are being implemented is important.  The education is to inform the beneficiaries of their human rights as well as the ways in which NGOs and other organizations are attempting to increase their human rights.  Education is also to inform the governments, international organizations and donor agencies that are dealing with human rights their roles and responsibilities.  Then there is the principle of rights to participation.  This deals with the idea that beneficiaries should be included when implementing programs on their behalf.  Organizations should include the beneficiaries to help [[Empowerment|empower]].  Then there is the principle of accountability which is designed to have standards of human rights and development.  It is also designed for NGOs, international organizations, donor agencies and governments to be held to a higher standard of responsibility.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

[[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] are two NGOs that have been involved traditionally with advocacy in relation to human rights.  These NGOs have expanded from traditional political rights to expand to ESC rights, which includes economic and social rights as well.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

[[Oxfam]] is an NGO that has adopted the rights-based approach to development.  [[Oxfam]] vowed to continue to provide relief while also addressing the structural causes of poverty and injustice.  This approach combines poverty, human rights, development and trade all within the same realm.  [[Oxfam]] focuses a broad approach to the causes of poverty and injustice.  This NGO also would like to put economic and social justice at the top of the world agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Aaronson and Zimmerman, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The shift towards a rights-based approach to development forced [[Oxfam]] to reexamine its funding, a deeper examination into the state's role as a duty bearer, and using civil society as a vehicle for citizens to empowered to stand up for their rights. [[Oxfam]] also had to evaluate their development practices and business model.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003}}

There has been a shift from focusing upon civil human rights to human rights of social and economic areas.  There are many NGOs that are now focusing upon the ESC (economic and social rights) while creating and implementing programs.  [[Human Rights Watch]] is one of these NGOs that has implemented a focus on ESC rights.  These rights focus on alleviating poverty and implementing equal social and economic rights in all levels of society.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

NGOs that have implemented these ESC rights are focusing much of their attention on increasing the standard of living to be healthy and safe.  This includes ideas of [[water rights]] in areas that lack clean drinking water and health rights that include availability of medicine and doctors. This would increase the impoverished peoples' standard of living by increasing basic living needs and access.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

====International Development Agencies involvement====

Beginning in the late 1990s when rights-based approach to development began to be a popular discourse many aid donor agencies began to support this view towards development.  Their intentions are to implement support for programs to incorporate both development and human rights in an interdisciplinary fashion.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003}}

Major donor agencies that have adopted the rights-based approach to development include [[UNICEF]], [[UNDP]] (United Nations Development Program), UNFPA, ILO, Swedish Sida, Norwegian NOrad, British DFID, and the Australian aid agency.  Other UN programs have also adopted the rights-based approach to development.  This new development framework leads to moral legitimacy and social justice.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

[[UNDP]] The United Nations Development Program began in the late 1990s to raise awareness about this new rights-based approach viewpoint to development.  [[UNDP]] specifically focused upon the interactions of social and economic rights.  Their focus was to help develop policy decisions related to social and economic rights in association with development.  In 2000 [[UNDP]] published "Human Rights and Human Development" a document that provided their intentions and strategies based on their implementation of rights-based approach to development.  UNDP was also present at UN- sponsored conferences in relation to rights-based approach to development that included the UN Millennium Summit.  UNDP also provides tools for governments and donor agencies to support the rights-based approach to development.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003}}{{cite web |url=http://www.ntd.co.uk/idsbookshop/details.asp?id=847 |title=What is the Rights Based Approach all about? Perspectives from International Development Agencies |author=Celestine Nyamu-Musembi and Andrea Cornwall |date=2004 |work= |publisher=Institute of Development Studies |accessdate=July 10, 2012}}

[[UNICEF]] is another donor agency that has implemented the rights-based approach to development and its ideas.  UNICEF has a more narrow focus on women's and children's rights.  However, it has still implemented rights-based approach strategies with the programs UNICEF is helping to fund.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003}}

===Application of rights-based approach in NGOs===
NGOs transitioning to rights-based approach have to redefine missions, test new methodologies, reallocate funding, and train staff. To do this there are a few steps NGOs have to take in developing programs and campaigns around rights-based approach.

First, NGOs need to create program ideas. These are created based on an analysis of rights within a certain country. The analysis is necessary to identify and give priority to the most deprived in society. It is then the goal of a rights-based approach to empower those people. This step also identifies and reviews the [[capacity utilization|capacity]] of the duty-bearers. It also tries to understand the relationship between the rights holders and the duty bearers.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=33}}

The next step is to educate both the rights holders and the duty bearers by articulating the rights of citizens and duty of the [[government]]. This is an important step so both parties are knowledgeable about their individual rights, responsibilities, and roles in society. This enables effective communication necessary between rights holders and duty bearers.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=34}}

After an extensive [[situation analysis]], a project or program is developed. The program needs to address [[human rights]] deficits related to certain groups, communities, or countries facing abuses or [[discrimination]]. Baselines and benchmarks are set, which create transparency and [[accountability]] in the project. Goals are also created during this step in order to analyze the program's effectiveness in a [[human rights]] context at the end of the project. Finally, NGOs encourage control over the project by the affected peoples, utilizing the Right to Participate principle.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=36}}

To determine the effectiveness of a project, it is essential all inputs, outputs, goals, and outcomes are assessed through a [[human rights]] lens. The results should then be organized in a [[logframe]], to show the clear results of the project.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=37}}

==Criticism==
This new development theory of rights-based approach has been met with positive feedback as well as criticism. There are thoughts that incorporating the language of human rights with development is just a change of terminology and doesn’t change the programs being implemented.  The ability for a state to implement public policy has been hindered due to the need to comply with economic and social rights (ESC rights).  Development practices without combining them with [[human rights]] has been more effective in implementing and monitoring programs.  Therefore, the need to combine human rights with development is not necessary for the beneficiaries.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

While there still is more positive feedback when dealing with rights-based approach to development there are still criticisms surrounding the focus on combining human rights with development.  These criticisms stem from the idea that changing the terminology will not increase NGOs' productivity or even necessarily the NGOs' programs that are being implemented.  Just by stating that the government and corporations should now be responsible for development as an issue of human rights does not mean that any changes in procedures will occur.{{sfn|Tsikata|2009}}

Another criticism that has been brought up is that there have been many NGOs that have combined the ideas of human rights along with development before the term "rights-based approach to development" was coined.  There has been a natural linkage between development and rights and there has frequently been pressure on states and governments to be involved with issues of human rights as well as development.  Therefore, in many cases, changing the terminology will not increase the effectiveness of the state.{{sfn|Tsikata|2009}}

There have been other criticisms of the rights-based approach to development because the ideas and theories have not been narrowed.  Rights-based approach is a vague term that doesn't clearly represent a set of ideas.  There is a multiplicity of explanations about rights-based approach that poses problems when discussing how NGOs, donor agencies or UN programs will try to implement these ideas into their programs.{{sfn|Tsikata|2009}}

One example of implementation is within the realm of [[Gender and Development]].  [[Women's rights]] have long been fighting for equal rights and by implementing rights-based approach to development it changes some of the ways women's equal rights were being implemented effectively into society.  There have been two main paths relating to inequalities of gender; these include human rights organizations that focus on women's equal rights and organizations focused on gender and development.  By converging these two different ideas it can create problems with the experts and the way the programs are being implemented.{{sfn|Tsikata|2009}}

There is also disparity between NGOs in the north and NGOs in the south between their viewpoints and ideas in which to implement programs in relation to development and human rights separately.  By trying to combine these two discourses across the globe can create problems of fragmentation of ideas and programs.  If fragmentation were to occur it would be the opposite intention of the NGOs that were trying to combine human rights and development into similar programs.{{sfn|Tsikata|2009}}

Sensory gardens can be designed in such a way as to be accessible and enjoyable for both [[disabled]] and non-disabled users. A sensory garden, for example, may contain features accessible to the disabled individual such as: scented and edible plants, sculptures and sculpted handrails, water features designed to make sound and play over the hands, textured touch-pads, magnifying-glass screens, braille and audio [[induction loop]] descriptions.  Depending on the user group, other provisions may integrate sound and music more centrally to combine the play needs of younger users with their sensory needs.

Many sensory gardens devote themselves to providing experience for multiple senses; those specialising in scent are sometimes called [[scented gardens]], those specialising in music/sound are sound gardens where the equipment doubles up to provides an enhanced opportunity for strategic developmental, learning and educational outcomes.

Sensory Gardens usually have an enhanced infrastructure to permit [[wheelchair access]] and meet other accessibility concerns; the design and layout provides a stimulating journey through the senses, heightening awareness, and bringing positive learning experiences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6600">The '''Social Distance Corollary''' is a [[theory]] in communication research that concerns the tendency of people to perceive others to be more susceptible to media influence than they actually are.

This tendency is at the heart of the third-person effect, a phenomenon first defined and investigated by Davison (1983). Since then, much research has born out Davidson’s (1983) statement that “in the view of those trying to evaluate the effects of communication, its greatest impact will not be on “me” or “you,” but on “them”—the third persons.” Although “me” and “you” are put in one category, it is implied that some degree of distance exists between self and such close others as friends and lovers (Tsfati &amp; Cohen, 2004). More explicit remoteness exists between “me” and ”you” as a single unit and “them,” or others.

==Social distance==

The notion of [[social distance]] was first introduced by the [[sociologist]] Emory Bogardus (1925), who referred to it as the degrees of understanding and feeling that people experience regarding each other. Considering the social distance phenomenon an aspect of Davison’s (1983) third-person perception, Perloff (1993) articulated it as a complex variable including perceived similarity, familiarity, and identification, and pointed that there are at least two different ways to conceptualize social distance. First, social distance is a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] going from “just like me” to “not at all like me.” Second, social distance reflects the [[heterogeneity]] and size of the audience. Perloff (1993), reviewing 16 studies of the third-person effect, acknowledged that the phenomenon is magnified when the hypothetical others are defined in broad terms. Thus, in Perloff’s (2002) terms, social distance corollary is “the notion that self-other disparities grow in magnitude with increases in perceived distance between self and comparison others.” 

The social distance corollary is not dependent on whether there are media effects or not; rather, it is a perceptual phenomenon. To measure estimates of effects on self and others, Brosius and Engel (1996) constructed a questionnaire comprising three independent variables: First person; Third person, close distance; and Third person, remote distance. In other words, Brosius and Engel varied psychological distance and found that perceived effects were greater for “remote” others. Also it was found that third-person effects reveal itself most strongly among people of higher age and education. 

Cohen, Mutz, Price, and Gunther (1988) found that [[Stanford]] students perceived media effects to be less on themselves than on other Stanford students; also, other Californians were considered to be more susceptible to media impact than “other Stanford students.” A similar study (Gunther, 1991) was done at the [[University of Minnesota]], and the social distance phenomenon was supported. As groups became more broadly defined (other University of Minnesota students, other [[Minnesota]] residents), participants’ perception of media effects on the groups increased. 

Investigating the third-person effect in regard to political identification, Duck, Hogg, and Terry (1995) found that perception of self-other differences in media vulnerability are influenced by the subjectively salient social relationship between self and other, and are governed by motivational needs, such as [[self-esteem]], social-identity, and differentiation from others. Other researchers (e.g., Burger, 1981; Schlenker &amp; Miller, 1977) suggested that [[self-serving bias]]es consider close friends and relatives as an extension of self, whereas such a vague category as “other” might evoke [[stereotype]]s in people’s minds (Perloff &amp; Fetzer, 1986).  

After several studies, the notion of [[social distance]] was enshrined as the “social distance corollary” (Meirick, 2005). According to Perloff’s review (1999), of the 11 studies that have tested the social-distance notion, 9 confirmed it, articulating this phenomenon as “another factor on which the strength of the third-person effect hinges.”

* the constant feuds between [[Aristocracy|aristocrats]] in [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic Greece]], and their struggles to attain the best in title (''aristos'' is Greek for "the best") both in terms of prestige and property. It led to various [[civil war]]s and the establishment of [[Tyrant|Tyrannies]] in many cities of ancient Greece, most notably the Tyranny of [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratos]] in [[Athens]]
* the feuding between oligarchic and democratic factions in the Greek city-states of the 5th and 4th centuries BC. This is a theme of [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', which features a famous description of factional fighting on the island of Corcyra&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, Peloponnesian War III 69-85&lt;/ref&gt; (modern Corfu).

==The ''Aristeuein''-ideal==
According to the [[Iliad]], the goal of all men of honour in archaic Greece was to ''always be the first and superior to the others''.&lt;ref&gt;Iliad 6, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;  This ideal was called the ''aristeuein''- or ''aristeia''-Ideal. In [[Homer]]'s days, this ideal was mainly based on performance skills in speaking and fighting, and included wisdom, self-restraint, loyalty, and bravery (e.g., leading armies in the front row). For decades, prestige, which was a requisite for might, originated in speaking ability and military virtues. This is true for the cases of both [[Solon]] and [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratos]] by [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.1.i.html 1,60]&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Aristotle]] in the ''Athenaion Politeia''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/aristotle-athcon.txt 2.1]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, success at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], especially in the field of four-horse chariot racing, was a peaceful way to gain prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus (5, 71 [http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.5.v.html]) mentions this when introducing [[Cylon of Athens|Kylon]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The resulting civil wars==
Since ancient Athens before [[Solon]] did not have a fixed state order or instruments of power that belonged only to the state, the aristocrats could compete violently for office and property.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] writes about 600 BC: "Money is the man", while both [[Hesiod]] and [[Solon]] mention aristocrats ruthlessly trying to enlarge their wealth during the 7th century BC&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, as methods became more and more violent, aristocrats and their ''oikoi'' (families and followers) were engaged in civil strife against each other. At the beginning of the 6th century, the situation worsened,&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]]: Solon, 13, see also ''Athenaion Politeia'': 5,1 [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/aristotle-athcon.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; so that the aristocrats of [[Athens]] made Solon a lawmaker and arbitrator. The result was the [[Solon#Solon's reforms|Solonic Reforms]]. From then on, the term ''tyrannos'' (tyrant) became increasingly connected with violence and lawless might, a development which was fruitful only after the death of Solon's successor, the ''tyrannos'' [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratos]].

==''Stasis'' under Peisistratos==
After Solon's retirement from Athenian politics, the struggle for might continued, because the Athenian society wasn't ready for a fixed state order yet.&lt;ref&gt;Schlange-Schöningen, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Peisistratos' regime, the ''stasis'' continued, but only for charges under the tyrant, thus both securing him by appeasing the other aristocrats, and accustoming them to fixed charges given by a ruler, which paved the way for the reforms of [[Cleisthenes]]. Thus, aristocrats like [[Callias]] and [[Cimon]] had to struggle for prestige by winning in Olympia or showing off their wealth, not by becoming tyrants, while [[Miltiades the Elder]] emigrated from Athens and became head of a colony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.6.vi.html Herodotus (6,34)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15869">{{About|the pseudolegal theory||Straw man (disambiguation)}}
'''Strawman theory''' (also called the '''Strawman illusion''') is a [[pseudolaw|pseudolegal]] theory prevalent in various movements such as [[sovereign citizen]], [[tax protestor]], [[freeman on the land]], and the [[redemption movement]]. The theory holds that an individual has two personas, one of flesh and the other a separate legal personality (i.e., the "strawman"). The idea is that an individual’s debts, liabilities, taxes and legal responsibilities belong to the strawman rather than the physical individual.{{R|"SPLC1"}} The strawman theory is recognized in law as a scam: The [[FBI]] considers anyone promoting it a likely fraudster,{{R|"FBI"}}. The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) considers it a frivolous argument and fines people that use the theory on their Federal tax returns.{{R|"IRS"}}{{R|"Lii"}}

== About ==

Strawman theory traces its origins to the ancient Roman legal practice of ''[[capitis deminutio]]'' ("decrease of head"), a term used in Roman trials for the [[extinguishment]] of a person's former legal capacity. ''Capitis deminutio minima'' meant a person ceased to belong to a particular family, without loss of liberty or citizenship. ''Capitis deminutio media'' involved loss of citizenship and family, but not liberty. ''Capitis deminutio maxima'' involved loss of family, citizenship and liberty (''i.e.'', a slave or a prisoner of war).{{R|"Mackenzie1862"}} Strawman theory commonly takes the term ''capitis deminutio'' spells it "Capitis Diminutio" and claims ''capitis diminutio maxima'' was represented by an individual’s name being written in capital letters. This led to the idea that individuals had a separate legal personality now called a "strawman".{{R|"Weill"}}

The theory holds that an individual has two personas. One of them is a physical, tangible human being, and the other is the ''legal person'', often referred to as a legal fiction. When a baby is born in the U.S., a birth certificate is issued, and the parents apply for a Social Security number. Sovereigns say the government uses that birth certificate to set up a secret Treasury account which it funds with an amount ranging from $600,000 to $20 million, depending on the particular sovereign belief system. Hence, every newborn's rights are split between those held by the flesh-and-blood baby and the corporate shell account.{{R|"SPLC1"}}

Proponents of the theory believe the evidence is found on the birth certificate. Because many certificates show all capitals to spell out a baby's name, JOHN DOE (under the Strawman theory) is the name of the "straw man," and John Doe is the baby's "real" name. As the child grows, most legal documents will contain capital letters, which means that his state-issued driver's license, his marriage license, his car registration, his criminal court records, his cable TV bill, correspondence from the IRS, etc., pertain to his strawman and not his sovereign identity.{{R|"SPLC1"}} In reality, the use of all capital letters is typically done to make certain statements clear and conspicuous, although this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/sovereign-citizens-movement|title=Sovereign Citizens Movement|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main use of strawman theory is in escaping and denying debts, liabilities and legal responsibility. Tax protestors, "commercial redemption" and "get out of debt free" scams claim that one’s debts and taxes are the responsibility of the strawman and not of the real person. They back this claim by misreading the legal definition of ''[[person]]''{{R|"Blacks_Person"}} and a misunderstanding of the distinction between a ''[[juridicial person]]''{{R|"Blacks_Jperson"}} and a ''[[natural person]]''.{{R|"Blacks_Nperson"}} In accepted legal theory there is a difference between what is known as a ''natural person'' and that of a ''corporate person''. A ''[[corporate personhood]]'' applies to business, charities, governments and other recognized organisations. Courts recognize human beings as 'persons', not as a legal fiction joined to a flesh and blood human being but as one and the same.{{R|"CanadaLaw"}} They have never recognized a right to distance oneself from one's person, or the ability to opt out of personhood.{{R|"Lovejoy"}}

Believers of the theory also extend it to law and legal responsibilities, claiming that only their strawman is required to adhere to statutory laws. They also claim that legal proceedings in are taken against strawmen rather than persons and when one appears in court they appear as representing their strawman. The justification for this is the false notion that governments cannot force anybody to do anything. A strawman therefore created which the adherent believes he or she is free to command. Proponents cite a misinterpretation of a passage in chapter 39 of [[John, King of England|King John]]'s [[Magna Carta]] stating in part that, "no freeman will be seized, dispossessed of his property, or harmed except by the law of the land”.{{R|"MagnaCarta"}}

Freemen believe that separating from their strawman or refusing to be identified as such enables escape from their various liabilities, responsibilities, and laws. This is typically attempted by denying they are a person in the same way as their strawman, or by writing their name in non-standard ways, using red ink, and placing finger prints on court documents.{{R|"Williams"}}

Judge [[Norman K. Moon]] found such tactics an unconvincing argument in 2013 when an individual named Brandon Gravatt tried to overturn a drug conviction and get out of prison. The case was summarily dismissed by the court.{{R|"Moon"}}

It is impossible to dodge the law by insisting that an individual is different from his or her person. If a court can establish a person's identity, regardless of consent or cooperation, the court will engage in proceedings and sanctions against the individual. This is due to the legal principle known as ''[[Idem sonans]]'' (Latin for "sounding the same") which states that similar sounding names are just as valid in referring to a person.{{R|"Blacks_Idem"}} The earliest legal precedent is R v Davis in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1851.{{R|"ARCHBOLD1867"}}

{{cquote|If two names spelt differently necessarily sound alike, the court may, as matter of law, pronounce them to be idem sonantia; but if they do not necessarily sound alike, the question whether they are idem sonantia is a question of fact for the jury.}}

|''United States v. Washington'' (1996)
|Kurt Washington
|Kurt Washington was charged with two counts of tax evasion. As part of the proceedings, he filed a motion to dismiss the charges on numerous grounds, including that the person charged was a strawman.
|"...the defendant contends that the Indictment must be dismissed because “KURT WASHINGTON,” spelled out in capital letters, is a fictitious name used by the Government to tax him improperly as a business, and that the correct spelling and presentation of his name is “Kurt Washington.” This contention is baseless."{{R|"Washington1996"}}

|''State of Colorado v. Drew''
|Donald James Drew
|Donald Drew was previously convicted after pleading guilty to first degree kidnapping and conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance. Drew then filed a motion to vacate that conviction.
|“The core of defendant’s argument on appeal is that (1) he was born Donald James Drew, and the person charged in this matter was DONALD JAMES DREW; (2) the capitalization of the name created a “Strawman/Stramineous Homo/Ens Legis/ Artificial Person” (artificial person); (3) the artificial person was convicted; (4) he has been incarcerated as surety chattel or security for the artificial person; and (5) he has been denied due process. “Claims so premised are patently frivolous and without merit.”{{R|"Drew"}}

|''Jaeger v. Dubuque County''
|Raymond Jaeger (plaintiff)
|Raymond Jaeger filed a $2M lawsuit against Iowa state law enforcement &amp; Department of Natural Resources, alleging illegal search and seizure. The ruling was made in response to a motion to strike the presented active defense. 
|"The court finds Jaeger’s arguments concerning capitalization otherwise specious. The court routinely capitalizes the names of all parties before this court in all matters, civil and criminal, without any regard to their corporate or individual status...Jaeger’s motions to strike are denied as to improper capitalization."{{R|"Jaeger"}}

|''United States v. Furman''
|William Michael Furman
|William Furman was charged with two counts of conspiracy related to a scheme to defraud a bank and launder money. After being convicted, Furman filed an appeal based on the strawman theory, alleging both a literal misspelling of his name and the "improper" capitalizations typically seen in such arguments.
|"Here, the difference between "Micheal" and "Michael" is a mere transposition of letters with presumably little (if any) auditory significance, and the difference between "WILLIAM MICHAEL FURMAN" and "William Michael Furman" is a mere change of case with absolutely no auditory significance."{{R|"Furman"}}

{{Type systems}}

'''Substructural type systems''' are a family of [[type system]]s analogous to [[substructural logic]]s where one or more of the [[structural rule]]s are absent or only allowed under controlled circumstances. Such systems are useful for constraining access to [[system resource]]s such as [[Computer file|files]], [[Lock (computer science)|locks]] and [[Computer memory|memory]] by keeping track of changes of state that occur and preventing invalid states.{{sfn|Walker|2002|p=X}}{{sfn|Walker|2002|p=4}}

== Different substructural type systems ==
Several type systems have emerged by discarding some of the [[structural rule|structural rules]] of exchange, weakening, and contraction:
{| class="wikitable"
|+
!
!exchange
!weakening
!contraction
!use
|-
!linear
|allowed
|—

|exactly once
|-
!affine

|at most once
|-
!relevant
|allowed
|—
|allowed
|at least once
|-
!ordered
|—
|—
|—
|exactly once in order
|}

* '''Linear type systems''' (allow exchange, but neither weakening nor contraction): Every variable is used exactly once.
* '''Affine type systems''' (allow exchange and weakening, but not contraction): Every variable is used at most once.
* '''Relevant type systems''' (allow exchange and contraction, but not weakening): Every variable is used at least once.
* '''Ordered type systems''' (discard exchange, contraction, and weakening): Every variable is used exactly once in the order it was introduced.

The explanation for affine type systems is best understood if rephrased as “every ''occurrence'' of a variable is used at most once”.

=== Linear type systems ===
'''Linear types''' corresponds to [[linear logic]] and ensures that objects are used exactly once, allowing the system to safely [[Memory management|deallocate]] an object after its use.{{sfn|Walker|2002|p=6}}

The [[Clean (programming language)|Clean programming language]] makes use of [[uniqueness type]]s (a variant of linear types) to help support concurrency, [[input/output]], and in-place update of arrays.{{sfn|Walker|2002|p=43}}

Linear type systems allow [[Reference (computer science)|reference]]s but not [[Aliasing (computing)|alias]]es. To enforce this, a reference goes out of [[scope (programming)|scope]] after appearing on the right-hand side of an [[assignment (computer science)|assignment]], thus ensuring that only one reference to any object exists at once. Note that passing a reference as an [[parameter (computer science)|argument]] to a [[function (computer science)|function]] is a form of assignment, as the function parameter will be assigned the value inside the function, and therefore such use of a reference also causes it to go out of scope.

A linear type system is similar to [[C++]]'s [[unique_ptr]] [[class (computer science)|class]], which behaves like a pointer but can only be moved (i.e. not copied) in an assignment. Although the linearity constraint is checked at [[compile time]], dereferencing an invalidated unique_ptr causes undefined behavior at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr std::unique_ptr reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

The single-reference property makes linear type systems suitable as programming languages for [[quantum computation]], as it reflects the [[no-cloning theorem]] of quantum states.  From the [[category theory]] point of view, no-cloning is a statement that there is no [[diagonal functor]] which could duplicate states; similarly, from the [[combinator]] point of view, there is no K-combinator which can destroy states.  From the [[simply typed lambda calculus|lambda calculus]] point of view, a variable ''x'' can appear exactly once in a term.&lt;ref&gt;John c. Baez and Mike Stay, "[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta/rose3.pdf Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone]", (2009) [https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340/ ArXiv 0903.0340] in ''New Structures for Physics'', ed. Bob Coecke, ''Lecture Notes in Physics'' vol. '''813''', Springer, Berlin, 2011, pp. 95-174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linear type systems are the [[internal language]] of [[closed monoidal category|closed symmetric monoidal categories]], much in the same way that [[simply typed lambda calculus]] is the language of [[Cartesian closed categories]].  More precisely, one may construct [[functor]]s between the category of linear type systems and the category of closed symmetric monoidal categories.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ambler, "[http://www.lfcs.inf.ed.ac.uk/reports/92/ECS-LFCS-92-194/  First order logic in symmetric monoidal closed categories]", Ph.D. thesis, U. of Edinburgh, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affine type systems ===
'''Affine types''' are a version of linear types allowing to ''discard'' (i.e. ''not use'') a resource, corresponding to [[affine logic]]. An affine resource ''can'' only be used once, while a linear one ''must'' be used once.

=== Relevant type system ===
'''Relevant types''' correspond to [[relevant logic]] which allows exchange and contraction, but not weakening, which translates to every variable being used at least once.

=== Ordered type system ===
'''Ordered types''' correspond to [[noncommutative logic]] where exchange, contraction and weakening are discarded. This can be used to model [[stack-based memory allocation]] (contrast with linear types which can be used to model heap-based memory allocation).{{sfn|Walker|2002|pp=30–31}} Without the exchange property, an object may only be used when at the top of the modelled stack, after which it is popped off resulting in every variable being used exactly once in the order it was introduced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9715">A '''surrogate model''' is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest cannot be easily directly measured, so a model of the outcome is used instead. Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as function of design variables.  For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the air flow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..).  For many real world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete.  As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and ''what-if'' analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.

One way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models, known as '''surrogate models''', [[Response surface methodology|response surface models]], ''metamodels'' or ''emulators'', that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Surrogate models are constructed using a data-driven, bottom-up approach. The exact, inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known (or even understood), solely the input-output behavior is important. A model is constructed based on modeling the response of the simulator to a limited number of intelligently chosen data points. This approach is also known as behavioral modeling or black-box modeling, though the terminology is not always consistent.  When only a single design variable is involved, the process is known as [[curve fitting]].

Though using surrogate models in lieu of experiments and simulations in engineering design is more common, surrogate modelling may be used in many other areas of science where there are expensive experiments and/or function evaluations.

==Goals==

The scientific challenge of surrogate modeling is the generation of a surrogate that is as accurate as possible, using as few simulation evaluations as possible. The process comprises three major steps which may be interleaved iteratively:

* Sample selection (also known as sequential design, optimal experimental design (OED) or active learning)
* Construction of the surrogate model and optimizing the model parameters (bias–variance trade-off)
* Appraisal of the accuracy of the surrogate.

The accuracy of the surrogate depends on the number and location of samples (expensive experiments or simulations) in the design space. Various [[design of experiments]] (DOE) techniques cater to different sources of errors, in particular, errors due to noise in the data or errors due to an improper surrogate model.

==Types of surrogate models==

The most popular surrogate models are polynomial [[response surface]]s, [[kriging]], [[Gradient-Enhanced Kriging (GEK)]], [[radial basis function]], [[support vector machine]]s, [[space mapping]],&lt;ref name="space mapping"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1262727 J.W. Bandler, Q. Cheng, S.A. Dakroury, A.S. Mohamed, M.H. Bakr, K. Madsen and J. Søndergaard, "Space mapping: the state of the art," IEEE Trans. Microwave Theory Tech., vol. 52, no. 1, pp. 337-361, Jan. 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[artificial neural networks]]. For some problems, the nature of true function is not known a priori so it is not clear which surrogate model will be most accurate. In addition, there is no consensus on how to obtain the most reliable estimates of the accuracy of a given surrogate.
Many other problems have known physics properties. In these cases, physics-based surrogates such as [[space-mapping]] based models are the most efficient.&lt;ref name="space mapping" /&gt;

A recent survey of surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization techniques can be found in.&lt;ref&gt;Jin Y (2011). Surrogate-assisted evolutionary computation: Recent advances and future challenges. Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 1(2):61–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanning two decades of development and engineering applications, Rayas-Sanchez reviews aggressive [[space mapping]] exploiting surrogate models.&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Rayas-Sanchez,[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7423860&amp;action=search&amp;sortType=&amp;rowsPerPage=&amp;searchField=Search_All&amp;matchBoolean=true&amp;queryText=(%22Document%20Title%22:simplicity%20in%20asm) "Power in simplicity with ASM: tracing the aggressive space mapping algorithm over two decades of development and engineering applications"], IEEE Microwave Magazine, vol. 17, no. 4, pp. 64-76, April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Razavi et al. has published a state-of-the-art review of surrogate models used in water resources management field. &lt;ref&gt; Razavi, S., B. A.Tolson, and D. H.Burn (2012), Review of surrogate modeling in water resources, Water Resour. Res., 48, W07401, doi: 10.1029/2011WR011527. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Invariance properties==
Recently proposed comparison-based surrogate models (e.g. ranking [[support vector machine]]) for [[evolutionary algorithms]], such as [[CMA-ES]], allow to preserve some invariance properties of surrogate-assisted optimizers:

*1. Invariance with respect to monotonous transformations of the function (scaling)
*2. Invariance with respect to [[orthogonal transform]]ations of the search space (rotation).

==Applications==

An important distinction can be made between two different applications of surrogate models: design optimization and design space approximation (also known as emulation).

In surrogate model based optimization an initial surrogate is constructed using some of the available budget of expensive experiments and/or simulations. The remaining experiments/simulations are run for designs which the surrogate model predicts may have promising performance. The process usually takes the form of the following search/update procedure.

*1. Initial sample selection (the experiments and/or simulations to be run)
*2. Construct surrogate model
*3. Search surrogate model (the model can be searched extensively, e.g. using a [[genetic algorithm]], as it is cheap to evaluate)
*4. Run and update experiment/simulation at new location(s) found by search and add to sample
*5. Iterate steps 2 to 4 until out of time or design 'good enough'

Depending on the type of surrogate used and the complexity of the problem, the process may converge on a local or global optimum, or perhaps none at all.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D.R (2001), "A taxonomy of global optimization methods based on
response surfaces," Journal of Global Optimization, 21:345–383.&lt;/ref&gt;

In design space approximation, one is not interested in finding the optimal parameter vector but rather in the global behavior of the system. Here the surrogate is tuned to mimic the underlying model as closely as needed over the complete design space. Such surrogates are a useful, cheap way to gain insight into the global behavior of the system. Optimization can still occur as a post processing step, although with no update procedure (see above) the optimum found cannot be validated.

A ''''''sustainable''' habitat''' is an [[ecosystem]] that produces food and shelter for people and other organisms, without resource depletion and in such a way that no external waste is produced.  Thus the habitat can continue into future tie without external infusions of resource. Such a sustainable habitat may evolve naturally or be produced under the influence of man.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} A [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[habitat]] that is created and designed by human intelligence will mimic nature, if it is to be successful. Everything within it is connected to a complex array of organisms, physical resources and functions. Organisms from many different [[biome]]s can be brought together to fulfill various ''ecological niches''.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The term often refers to sustainable [[:Category:Human habitats|human habitat]]s, which typically involve some form of [[green building]] or [[environmental planning]].

==Overview==
In creating the sustainable habitats, [[environmental scientist]]s, designers, engineers and [[architecture|architects]] must consider no element as a [[waste]] product to be disposed of somewhere off site, but as a nutrient stream for another process to feed on. Researching ways to interconnect waste streams to production creates a more sustainable society by minimizing [[pollution]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The '''three-component theory of stratification''', more widely known as '''Weberian stratification''' or the '''three class system''', was developed by German [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Max Weber]] with [[social class|class]], [[Social status|status]] and [[Political party|power]] as distinct ideal types. Weber developed a multidimensional approach to [[social stratification]] that reflects the interplay among wealth, prestige and power.
:Weber argued that power can take a variety of forms. A person's power can be shown in the social order through their status, in the economic order through their class, and in the political order through their party. Thus, class, status and party are each aspects of the distribution of power within a community.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 2007:202.&lt;/ref&gt;
Class, status and power have not only a great deal of effect within their individual areas but also a great deal of influence over the other areas.

* '''[[Wealth]]''': includes property such as buildings, lands, farms, houses, factories and as well as other assets – ''Economic Situation''
* '''Prestige''': the respect with which a person or status position is regarded by others – ''Status Situation''
* '''[[Power (politics)|Power]]''': the ability of people or groups to achieve their goals despite opposition from others – ''Parties''

According to Weber, there are two basic dimensions of power: the ''possession'' of power and the ''exercising'' of power. 

This essay was written shortly before [[World War I]] and was published posthumously in 1922 as part of Weber's ''Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft''.&lt;ref&gt;Weber 1922/1980:531-540.&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated into English in the 1940s as "Class, Status, Party"&lt;ref&gt;Weber 1946:180-195;  reproduced with modifications in Weber 1978:926-939.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been re-translated as "The distribution of power within the community: Classes, ''Stände'', Parties".&lt;ref&gt;Weber 2010.  See also Waters and Waters 2015.[https://www.academia.edu/29605297/Classes_Staende_Parties_by_Max_Weber_translated_by_Tony_and_Dagmar_Waters.doc]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possession of power==

According to Weber, the ability to possess power derives from the individual's ability to control various "social resources".  "The mode of distribution gives to the propertied a monopoly on the possibility of transferring property from the sphere of use as 'wealth' to the sphere of 'capital,' that is, it gives them the entrepreneurial function and all chances to share directly or indirectly in returns on capital" (Lemert 2004:116).  These resources can be anything and everything:  they might include land, capital, social respect, physical strength, and intellectual knowledge.

==Exercising of power==

The ability to exercise power takes a number of different forms, but all involve the idea that it means the ability to get your own way with others, regardless of their ability to resist you.  "For example, if we think about an individual's chances of realizing their own will against someone else, it is reasonable to believe that the person's social prestige, class position, and membership in a political group will have an effect on these chances" (Hurst 2007:202).  In terms of understanding the relationship between power and social stratification, Weber theorized the various ways in which societies are organized in hierarchical systems of domination and subordination using the several major concepts.

===Class and power===

"Class, at its core, is an economic concept; it is the position of individuals in the market that determines their class position. And it is how one is situated in the marketplace that directly affects one's life chances" (Hurst 2007:203). This was theorized by Weber on the basis of "unequal access to material resources". For example, if someone possesses something that you want or need then this makes him potentially more powerful than you. He is in a dominant position and you are in a subordinate position because he controls access to a desired social resource. A classic illustration here is the relationship between an employer and employee.

===Social power (status or ''Stände'')===

"The existence of status groups most often shows itself in the form of 

# [[endogamy]] or the restricted pattern of social intercourse,
# sharing of food and other benefits within groups,
# status conventions or traditions, and
# monopolistic acquisition of certain economic opportunities or the avoidance of certain kinds of acquisitions. (Hurst 2007:204)

If you respect someone or view him as your social superior, then he will potentially be able to exercise power over you (since you will respond positively to his instructions / commands). In this respect, social status is a social resource simply because he may have it while you may not. "Not all power, however entails social honor: The Typical American Boss, as well as the typical big speculator, deliberately relinquishes social honor. Quite generally, 'mere economic' power, and especially 'naked' money power, is by no means a recognized basis or social honor" (Lemert 2004:116).

Note: The German word ''Stand'', plural ''Stände'' (English, "status" or "status group") is sometimes left untranslated in Weber,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Weber 2010:142-148.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to keep in view the origins of this concept in medieval guilds, professions, ethnic identities, and feudal classifications.&lt;ref&gt;Waters and Waters 2015:37-40.[https://www.academia.edu/29605297/Classes_Staende_Parties_by_Max_Weber_translated_by_Tony_and_Dagmar_Waters.doc]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political power (party)===

Parties are associations that aim at securing "power within an organization [or the state] for its leaders in order to attain ideal or material advantages for its active members" (Hurst 2007:206). This form of power can be related to the way in which the State is organized in modern social systems (involving the ability to make laws, for example). If you can influence this process of law creation then you will be in a potentially powerful position. Thus, by your ability to influence a decision-making process you possess power, even though you may not directly exercise that power personally. Political parties are the organizational means to possess power through the mechanism of the State and they include not just formally organized parties, but any group that is organized to influence the way in which power is exercised legitimately through the machinery of the State.  "Since parties aim at such goals as getting their programs developed or accepted and getting positions of influence within organizations, it is clear that they operate only within a rational order within which these goals are possible to attain and only when there is a struggle for power" (Hurst 2007:206).

===Social action===
Social action is in direct relation to "political or party power" in combination with the class situation. The influence of laws is based on the social action of members of the classes. "The direction of interests may vary according to whether or not social action of a larger or smaller portion of those commonly affected by the class situation, or even an association among them, e.g., a trade union, has grown out of the class situation, from which the individual may expect promising results for himself" (Lemert 2004:117). "The degree in which "social action" and possibly associations emerge from the mass behavior of the members of a class is linked to general cultural conditions, especially to those of an intellectual sort. It is also likened to the extent of the contrasts that have already evolved" (Lemert 2004:118). "Class-conscious action is most likely if, first, [Weber says] 'the connection between the causes and consequences of the "class situation"' are transparent, or clear. If individuals can plainly see that there is a connection between the structure of the economic system and what happens to them in terms of life chances, class action is more likely" (Hurst 2007:204). The greater the numbers within these class positions, will increase the chance that they will rise up in action.

===Mobility===
"It is noncontroversial that the class situation in which each individual finds himself represents a limitation on his scope, tends to keep him within the class. It acts as an obstacle to any rise into a higher class, and as a pair of [[water wings]] with respect to the classes below…Class type, relations with class fellows, power over outward resources adapted to the class situation, and so on" (Schumpeter 1951:163-164). In [[capitalist]] society movement between classes is a possibility. Hence the use of the term "The [[American Dream]]" to show the ability of people to ascend to a higher class through hard work and ingenuity. "Class composition is forever changing, to the point where there may be a completely new set of families" (Schumpeter 1951:165).

Weber saw four classes:  the propertied class, the non-propertied class, the [[Petite bourgeoisie|petit bourgeoisie]] and the manual labourer class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1825">'''The Tolerance Act''' ({{lang-sv|Toleransediktet}}) was a Swedish law, enacted by [[Gustav III of Sweden]] 24 January 1781. It guaranteed freedom of religion and full citizen rights for all Christian immigrants and residents in Sweden.   

Since the [[Uppsala Synod]] of 1593, Lutheranism had officially been the only religion allowed in Sweden, though the foreign embassies were given dispensation. The Tolerance Act was introduced in line with the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. There were also an economical aspect, as it would make it easier for foreigners to work in Sweden. By the Act, all Christian immigrants were granted full freedom of religion and guaranteed their right to bring up their children in their faith as well. This act was followed in 1782 by the ''[[Judereglementet]]'' (The Jew's Law), which guaranteed the freedom of religion for Jewish immigrants. This Act was a step toward full freedom of religion in Sweden. However, they only applied to immigrants and foreigners, while the Lutheran Swedish citizens were still prohibited their freedom of religion through the ''[[konventikelplakatet]]''. 

The Tolerance Act was replaced by the [[Dissenter Acts (Sweden)]] from the 1850s, which guaranteed freedom of religion to all Swedish citizens. 

The final act was the law of 1951, which allowed for complete freedom of conscience by allowing citizens from leaving their religion without replacing it with another one, thereby formally also allowing atheism.

In [[computer science]], a '''value''' is the representation of some entity that can be manipulated by a program. The members of a [[type (computer science)|type]] are the values of that type.{{sfn|Mitchell|1996|p=9}} 

The "value of a variable" is given by the corresponding [[Map (computer science)|mapping]] in the [[environment (type theory)|environment]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In languages with [[assignable variable]]s it becomes necessary to distinguish between the ''r-value'' (or contents) and the ''l-value'' (or location) of a variable.{{sfn|Mitchell|1996|pp=389–390}}

In [[Declarative programming|declarative]] (high-level) languages, values have to be [[referential transparency (computer science)|referentially transparent]]. This means that the resulting value is independent of the location in which a (sub-)expression needed to compute the value is stored. Only the contents of the location (the bits, whether they are 1 or 0) and their interpretation are significant.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

=={{Anchor|lrvalue}}Assignment: l-values and r-values==
Some languages use the idea of '''l-values''' and '''r-values''', deriving from the typical mode of evaluation on the left and right hand side of an assignment statement. An lvalue refers to an object that persists beyond a single expression. An rvalue is a temporary value that does not persist beyond the expression that uses it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lvalues and Rvalues (Visual C++)|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f90831hc.aspx|website=Microsoft Developer Network|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of l-values and r-values was introduced by [[Combined Programming Language]] (CPL). The notions in an expression of r-value, l-value, and r-value/l-value are analogous to the [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameter]] modes of input parameter (has a value), [[output parameter]] (can be assigned), and input/output parameter (has a value and can be assigned), though the technical details differ between contexts and languages.

===R-values and addresses===
In many languages, notably the [[C programming language|C family]], l-values have [[memory address|storage address]]es that are programmatically accessible to the running program (e.g., via some address-of operator like "&amp;" in C/C++), meaning that they are variables or dereferenced references to a certain memory location. R-values can be l-values (see below) or non-l-values—a term only used to distinguish from l-values. Consider the C expression &lt;code&gt;4 + 9&lt;/code&gt;. When executed, the computer generates an integer value of 13, but because the program has not explicitly designated where in the computer this 13 is stored, the expression is a non l-value. On the other hand, if a C program declares a variable x and assigns the value of 13 to x, then the expression &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; has a value of 13 and is an l-value.

In C, the term l-value originally meant something that could be assigned to (hence the name, indicating it is on the left side of the assignment operator), but since the reserved word &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; (constant) was added to the language, the term is now 'modifiable l-value'. In [[C++11]] a special semantic-glyph &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; exists, to denote the ''use/access of the expression's address for the ''compiler'' only''; i.e., the address cannot be retrieved using the address-of, &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;, operator during the ''run-time'' of the program (see [[C++11#Rvalue references and move constructors|the use of move semantics]]).

This type of reference can be applied to ''all'' r-values including non-l-values as well as l-values. Some processors provide one or more instructions which take an '''immediate value''', sometimes referred to as "immediate" for short. An immediate value is stored as part of the instruction which employs it, usually to load into, add to, or subtract from, a register. The other parts of the instruction are the [[opcode]], and destination. The latter may be implicit. (A non-immediate value may reside in a register, or be stored elsewhere in memory, requiring the instruction to contain a direct or indirect address [e.g., index register address] to the value.)

The l-value expression designates (refers to) an object. A non-modifiable l-value is addressable, but not assignable. A modifiable l-value allows the designated object to be changed as well as examined. An r-value is any expression, a non-l-value is any expression that is not an l-value. One example is an "immediate value" (look below) and consequently not addressable..

== In assembly language ==
A value can be virtually any kind of data by a given [[data type]], for instance a string, a digit, a single letter.

Processors often support more than one size of immediate data, e.g. 8 or 16 bit, employing a unique opcode and mnemonic for each instruction variant. If a programmer supplies a data value that will not fit, the assembler issues an "Out of range" error message. Most assemblers allow an immediate value to be expressed as [[ASCII]], [[decimal]], [[hexadecimal]], [[octal]], or [[Binary code|binary]] data. Thus, the ASCII character &lt;tt&gt;'A'&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as &lt;tt&gt;65&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;0x41&lt;/tt&gt;. The [[byte order]] of strings may differ between processors, depending on the assembler and computer architecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25907">A '''war of annihilation''' ({{lang-de|Vernichtungskrieg|links=no}}) is a type of [[warfare]] in which the goal is the complete annihilation of a state, a people or an ethnic minority through [[genocide]] or through the destruction of their livelihood. The goal can be outward-directed or inward, against elements of one's own population. The goal is not like other types of warfare, the recognition of limited political goals, such as recognition of a legal status (such as in a [[war of independence]]), control of disputed territory (as in [[war of aggression]] or [[defensive war]]), or the 
total military defeat ([[debellatio]]) of an enemy state.
 
== Features ==
War of annihilation is defined as a radicalized form of [[warfare]] in which "all psycho-physical limits" are abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sven Lindqvist]]: ''Durch das Herz der Finsternis. Ein Afrika-Reisender auf den Spuren des europäischen Völkermords'', Unionsverlag, Zürich 1999, S. 62; Susanne Kuß, Bernd Martin: ''Das Deutsche Reich und der Boxeraufstand''. Iudicium, München 2002, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hamburg social scientist [[Jan Philipp Reemtsma]] sees a war, "which is led, in the worst case, to destroy or even decimate a population", as the heart of the war of annihilation.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Philipp Reemtsma: ''Die Idee des Vernichtungskrieges. Clausewitz – Ludendorff – Hitler''. In: [[Hannes Heer]], [[Klaus Naumann (historian)|Klaus Naumann]] (Eds.): ''Vernichtungskrieg. Verbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941–1944''. Hamburg 1995, pp. 377–401, hier S. 377, vgl. auch 386–398.&lt;/ref&gt;
The state organization of the enemy will be smashed. Another characteristic of a war of annihilation is its ideological character and the rejection of negotiations with the enemy, as the historian Andreas Hillgruber [[Andreas Hillgruber]] has shown in the example of the 1941 [[Operation Barbarossa]] against [[Jewish Bolshevism]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Hillgruber: ''Die ideologisch-dogmatische Grundlage der nationalsozialistischen Politik der Ausrottung der Juden in den besetzten Gebieten der Sowjetunion und ihre Durchführung 1941–1944''. In: German Studies Review 2 (1979), Bd. 3, p. 263–296.&lt;/ref&gt; The legitimacy and trustworthiness of the opponent is negated, demoted to status of a total enemy, with whom there can be no understanding, but rather devotes the totality of one's own ''"Volk, Krieg und Politik [als] Triumph der Idee des Vernichtungskrieges"'' (people, war and politics [to the] triumph of the idea of the war of annihilation).&lt;ref&gt;Jan Philipp Reemtsma: ''Die Idee des Vernichtungskrieges. Clausewitz – Ludendorff – Hitler'', pp. 386–398, Zitat p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
=== War of extermination ===
The term "war of extermination" was used in many American wars with [[Amerindian]]s, most notably California governor [[Peter Burnett]]'s prediction of one during the [[California Genocide]]:

{{cquote|That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected. While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert.|||—From California governor Peter Hardeman Burnett's Second Annual Message to the Legislature, January 7, 1851:&lt;ref&gt;"The Governor's Message (Transmitted January 7, 1851)," Sacramento Transcript, 10 January 1851, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On January 6, 1851 at his State of the State address to the California Senate, 1st Governor Peter Burnett used the following words: "That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct must be expected. While we cannot anticipate this result but with painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power or wisdom of man to avert."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Brenden C (2012). "Murder State: California's Native American Genocide, 1846–1873." University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln and London. p.231&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Herero uprising ===
[[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] political communications had circulated the term ''Vernichtungskrieg'' in order to criticize the action against the insurgents during the [[Herero Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank Oliver Sobich: ''„Schwarze Bestien, rote Gefahr“. Rassismus und Antisozialismus im deutschen Kaiserreich''. Campus, Frankfurt am Main 2006, S. 301–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1904 the [[Herero and Namaqua genocide]] began in the German colony [[German South West Africa]]. With a total of about 15,000 men under Lieutenant General [[Lothar von Trotha]], this uprising was prostrated until August 1904. Most of the Herero fled to the almost waterless [[Omaheke]], an offshoot of the [[Kalahari Desert]]. From Trotha had them locked down and the refugees chased away from the few water spots there, so that thousands of Herero along with their families and cattle herds thirst. The hunted in the desert, let Trotha in the so-called ''Vernichtungsbefehl'', "Annihilation Command":

{{quote|''Die Herero sind nicht mehr Deutsche Untertanen. […] Innerhalb der Deutschen Grenze wird jeder Herero mit oder ohne Gewehr, mit oder ohne Vieh erschossen, ich nehme keine Weiber und keine Kinder mehr auf, treibe sie zu ihrem Volke zurück oder lasse auch auf sie schießen.''

The Herero are no longer German subjects. [...] Within the German border, every Herero is shot with or without a rifle, with or without cattle, I take no more wives and no children, I drive them back to their people or let them be shot.|ref=Gewald&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Bart Gewald: ''The Great General of the Kaiser'', in: ''Botswana Notes and Records.'' Band 26, S. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Trotha's warfare aimed at the complete annihilation of the Herero ("I believe that the nation must be destroyed as such"&lt;ref&gt;Brief an Generalstabschef [[Alfred Graf von Schlieffen]], 5. Oktober 1904, in: Michael Behnen: ''Quellen zur deutschen Aussenpolitik im Zeitalter des Imperialismus 1890–1911.'' Darmstadt 1977, S. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;) and was supported in particular by Schlieffen and [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]].&lt;ref name="schaller"&gt;Dominik J. Schaller: ''»Ich glaube, dass die Nation als solche vernichtet werden muss: Kolonialkrieg und Völkermord in «Deutsch-Südwestafrika» 1904–1907«.'' In: ''Journal of Genocide Research.'' 6:3, S. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; His approach is therefore considered to be the first [[genocide]] of the twentieth century. Trotha's action sparked outrage in Germany and abroad; at the instigation of chancellor [[Bernhard von Bülow]], the Emperor lifted the order of annihilation two months after the events in the Omaheke. Trotha's policy remained largely unchanged until its revocation in November 1905.&lt;ref name="schaller" /&gt;

=== Ludendorff's conception ===
The war of annihilation was a further development of the concept of [[Total War]], as 1935 the former imperial [[Generalquartiermeister|General Quartermaster]] [[Erich Ludendorff]] had designed. Thereafter, in a coming war, victory must be given unlimited priority over all other societal concerns: all [[resources]] would have to be harnessed, the will of the nation had to be made available before the outbreak of the hostilities are unified by [[propaganda]] and dictatorship violence, all available weapons would have to be used, and no consideration could be taken of [[International law]]. Even in its objectives, total war is unlimited, as the experience of [[First World War]] teaching:

{{quote|''Ihn führten nicht nur die Wehrmächte der am Kriege beteiligten Staaten, die gegenseitig ihre Vernichtung erstrebten, die Völker selbst wurden in den Dienst der Kriegsführung gestellt, der Krieg richtete sich auch gegen sie selbst und zog sie selbst in tiefste Mitleidenschaft […] Zum Kampf gegen die feindlichen Streitkräfte auf gewaltigen Fronten und weiten Meeren gesellte sich das Ringen gegen die Psyche und Lebenskraft der feindlichen Völker zu dem Zweck, sie zu zersetzen und zu lähmen.''

They not only led the armed forces of the states involved in the war, who aspired to annihilate each other; the peoples themselves were put in the service of warfare; the war was also directed against them and pulled them into deepest passion [...] Fighting against the enemy forces on huge fronts and wide seas, the struggle against the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and [[Vitality|life force]] of the hostile peoples was joined with the purpose of depressing and paralyzing them.
|ref=Ludendorff 1935&lt;ref&gt;Erich Ludendorff: ''Der totale Krieg''. Ludendorffs Verlag, München 1935, S. 4&amp;nbsp;f.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this conceptual delimitation of the war, Ludendorff was able to draw from the German military-theoretical discourse, which had formed in the confrontation with the [[People's War]], the "Guerre à outrance", which the newly created [[Third French Republic]] in the fall and winter of 1870 against the Prussian-German invaders of the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref name="Fowley2001"&gt;Robert T. Foley: ''From Volkskrieg to Vernichtungskrieg. German Concepts of Warfare, 1871–1935.'' In: Anja Hartmann, Beatrice Heuser (Hrsg.): ''War, Peace, and World Orders in European History''. Routledge, London/New York 2001, S. 215–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludendorff also dealt with [[Carl von Clausewitz]] and his 1832 posthumously published work ''[[On War]]'', in which he distinguished between 'absolute' and 'limited' wars. But even for Clausewitz absolute war was subject to restrictions, such as the distinction between combatants and non-combatants, between military and civil or between public and private. Ludendorff claimed now that in total war it is no longer a "petty political purpose", not even "big [...] national interests", but the sheer ''Lebenserhaltung'' (life-support) of the nation, its identity. This existential threat also justifies the annihilation of the enemy, at least moral, if not physical. &lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Janssen: "War". In: [[Reinhart Koselleck]], [[Werner Conze]], [[Otto Brunner (historian) | Otto Brunner]] (eds.): ''Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe: Historisches Lexikon zur politisch-sozialen Sprache in Deutschland''. Historical lexicon on the political-social language in Germany. Vol. 3, Klett-Cotta, Stuttgart 1982, pp. 613.&lt;/ref&gt; Ludendorffs efforts to radicalize the war (for which he was responsible from 1916) met with social, political and military barriers. In the year 1935, his advice was then, as the historian Robert Foley writes, "on fertile ground"; the time seemed ripe for an even more radical delimitation of the war by the [[Nazism|National Socialists]].&lt;ref name="Fowley2001" /&gt;

=== Nazi warfare ===
{{further |Bandenbekämpfung}} 
The best known example of a ''Vernichtungskrieg'' is the [[German-Soviet War]], which began on June 22, 1941 with the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]]. The Berlin historian [[Ernst Nolte]] called this 1963 in a much-quoted formulation as the "most egregious ''Versklavungs- und Vernichtungskrieg'' [war of enslavement and annihilation] known to modern history" and distinguished it from a "normal war", as the Nazi regime conducted against France.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Nolte: ''Der Faschismus in seiner Epoche. Action francaise – Italienischer Faschismus – Nationalsozialismus''. Taschenbuchausgabe, Piper, München 1984, S. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1965 [[habilitation thesis]] ''Hitlers Strategie'' [[Andreas Hillgruber]] worked out the motifs of the Nazi state based on racial ideological basis for the war against the Soviet Union:
#The physical extinction of the "[[Jewish Bolshevism | Judeo-Bolshevik]]" elite of the country and the Jews themselves as their supposed biological root
#The conquest of colonial and ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for the German Reich and
#The subjugation and decimation of the Slavic population.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Hillgruber: ''Hitlers Strategie. Politik und Kriegführung 1940–1941.'' Frankfurt a.&amp;nbsp;M., 2. Auflage 1982, S.&amp;nbsp;519 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Hillgruber explicitly described the character of the Eastern Front as "intended racial-ideological war of annihilation".&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Hillgruber: ''Der Ostkrieg und die Judenvernichtung'', in: Gerd R. Ueberschär u. Wolfram Wette (Hrsg.): ''Der deutsche Überfall auf die Sowjetunion. „Unternehmen Barbarossa“ 1941.'' Fischer Taschenbuch, Frankfurt a.&amp;nbsp;M. 1991, S. 185–206, Zitat S. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Barbarossa has also found its way into the historical-political teaching of general education schools as a historical example of an extermination war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wigbert Benz]]: ''„Unternehmen Barbarossa“ 1941. Vernichtungskrieg und historisch-politische Bildung''. In: Informationen für den Geschichts- und Gemeinschaftskundeunterricht. Heft 60/2010, S. 5–33; [http://87.106.4.207/service/unter/benz_2.htm siehe auch Online-Version].&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the war of annihilation was intensely discussed in the 1990s with reference to the ''[[Wehrmachtsausstellung]]'' of the [[Hamburg Institute for Social Research]], which carried the word "''Vernichtungskrieg''" in the title.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hannes Heer]] u.&amp;nbsp;a. (Hrsg.): ''Verbrechen der Wehrmacht. Dimensionen des Vernichtungskrieges 1941–1944''. Ausstellungskatalog. Hamburger Institut für Sozialforschung. 1. Auflage, [[Hamburger Edition]], Hamburg 1996. Johannes Klotz: ''Die Ausstellung „Vernichtungskrieg, Verbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941 bis 1944“. Zwischen Geschichtswissenschaft und Geschichtspolitik.'' In: Detlef Bald, Johannes Klotz, Wolfram Wette: ''Mythos Wehrmacht. Nachkriegsdebatten und Traditionspflege''. Aufbau, Berlin 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; That Operation Barbarossa would be a war of annihilation, Adolf Hitler had pronounced openly on March 30, 1941 before the generals of the Wehrmacht:

{{quote|''Kampf zweier [[Weltanschauung]]en gegeneinander. Vernichtendes Urteil über Bolschewismus, ist gleich asoziales Verbrechertum. [[Kommunismus]] ungeheure Gefahr für die Zukunft. Wir müssen von dem Standpunkt des soldatischen Kameradentums abrücken. Der Kommunist ist vorher kein Kamerad und nachher kein Kamerad. Es handelt sich um einen Vernichtungskampf. Wenn wir es nicht so auffassen, dann werden wir zwar den Feind schlagen, aber in 30 Jahren wird uns wieder der kommunistische Feind gegenüberstehen. Wir führen nicht Krieg, um den Feind zu konservieren. […] Kampf gegen Rußland: Vernichtung der bolschewistischen Kommissare und der kommunistischen Intelligenz. […] Der Kampf wird sich sehr unterscheiden vom Kampf im Westen. Im Osten ist Härte mild für die Zukunft. Die Führer müssen von sich das Opfer verlangen, ihre Bedenken zu überwinden.'

Fight two [[worldview]]s against each other. Devastating verdict on [[Bolshevism]] is equal to antisocial criminality. [[Communism]] immense danger for the future. We have to move away from the position comradeship between soldiers. The communist is not a comrade before and not a comrade afterwards. It is a battle of annihilation. If we do not take it that way, we will beat the enemy, but in 30 years the Communist enemy will be facing us again. We are not waging war to preserve the enemy. [...] Fight against Russia: destruction of Bolshevik commissioners and Communist intelligence. [...] The fight will be very different from the fight in the West. In the east, hardness is mild for the future. The leaders must ask the victim to overcome their concerns.|ref=Halder 1963&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Halder]]: ''Kriegstagebuch. Tägliche Aufzeichnungen des Chefs des Generalstabes des Heeres 1939–1942, Bd. 2: Von der geplanten Landung in England bis zum Beginn des Ostfeldzuges''. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 1963, S. 335 ff.; [[Christian Hartmann (Historiker)|Christian Hartmann]]: ''Halder. Generalstabschef Hitlers 1938–1942''. Schoeningh, Paderborn 1991, S. 241 f.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The orientation of Operation Barbarossa as a prior planned war of annihilation proves the commands prepared according to the general guidelines cited by Hitler on 30 March 1941 before the start of the campaign, such as the [[Barbarossa Decree]] of 13 May 1941, the Guidelines for the conduct of the troops in Russia of 19 May 1941 and the [[Commissar Order]] of 6 June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rolf-Dieter Müller]], [[Gerd R. Ueberschär]]: ''Hitlers Krieg im Osten 1941–1945. Ein Forschungsbericht.'' Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 2000, S. 226 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German guidelines for agricultural policy in the Soviet territories to be conquered are one of the most extreme examples of a robbery and annihilation strategy. In a meeting of the secretaries of State on May 2, 1941, the [[Hunger Plan]] prepared:

{{quote|''Hierbei werden zweifellos zig Millionen Menschen verhungern, wenn von uns das für uns Notwendige aus dem Lande herausgeholt wird.''

This will undoubtedly starve tens of millions of people if we get what we need pried out of the country.|ref=Müller and Ueberschär 2000&lt;ref&gt;''Aktennotiz über Ergebnis der heutigen Besprechung mit Staatssekretären über Barbarossa vom 2.5.1941.''

In journalism and research, many other conflicts are also known as ''Vernichtungskrieg''.

In 1876, the German writer and historian [[Felix Dahn]] used the term for the first time in the modern sense: in his novel ''A struggle for Rome'' he let the Byzantine warlord [[Narses]] aim his campaign against [[Goths]] to Ethnic group in Italy completely utterly, i.e. lead a "war of annihilation against their entire folklore". &lt;ref&gt;Felix Dahn: ''Ein Kampf um Rom'' , in: ''Gesammelte Werke'' (Collected Works), First Series, vol. 2, Leipzig O.

The former employee of the German [[Military History Research Office (Germany)]] [[Joachim Hoffmann]] described in his book ' ' Stalin's Annihilation War ' ' (1995) the Soviet warfare against Nazi Germany as "War of Annihilation". He cites as the motto a speech [[Josef Stalin]] s of 6 November 1941, in which this stated:

{{quote|Well, if the Germans want a ''Vernichtungskrieg'', they will get it (stormy, prolonged applause). From now on, it will be our task to be the task of all the peoples of the Soviet Union, the task of the fighters, the commanders and the [[Political commissar|political officials of our army and our fleet]], to destroy all invading Germans occupying the territory of our homeland to the last man. No mercy to the German occupiers!{{efn|''Nun wohl, wenn die Deutschen einen Vernichtungskrieg wollen, so werden sie ihn bekommen (stürmischer, lang anhaltender Beifall).

Keine Gnade den deutschen Okkupanten!''&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Hoffmann: ''Stalins Vernichtungskrieg 1941–1945''. Verlag für Wehrwissenschaft, München 1995, S. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

Other academics do not follow Hoffmann's interpretation of the speech, but refer to Stalin's further statements in the following months that an annihilation of Germany is by no means his goal of war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernd Ulrich]]: ''Stalingrad'', C.H.

'''White supremacy''' or '''white supremacism''' is the [[racist]] belief that [[white people]] are superior to people of other [[Race (human classification)|races]] and therefore should be dominant over them. White supremacy has roots in [[scientific racism]], and it often relies on [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] arguments. Like most similar movements such as [[neo-Nazism]], white supremacists typically oppose members of other races as well as [[Jews]].

The term is also typically used to describe a [[political ideology]] that perpetuates and maintains the [[society|social]], [[politics|political]], [[historical revisionism|historical]], or [[institutional racism|institutional]] domination by white people (as evidenced by historical and contemporary sociopolitical structures such as the [[Atlantic slave trade]], [[Jim Crow laws]] in the [[United States]], and ''[[apartheid]]'' in [[South Africa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America |last=Wildman |first=Stephanie M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1996 |publisher=NYU Press |location= |isbn=0-8147-9303-7 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Helms 2016 6–7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helms|first=Janet|date=2016|title=An election to save White Heterosexual Male Privilege|url=|journal=Latina/o Psychology Today|volume=3|pages=6–7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of white supremacism put forth different conceptions of who is considered white, and different groups of white supremacists identify various racial and cultural groups as their primary enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spaces of Hate: Geographies of Discrimination and Intolerance in the U.S.A. |last=Flint |first=Colin |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0-415-93586-5 |page=53 |quote=Although white racist activists must adopt a political identity of whiteness, the flimsy definition of whiteness in modern culture poses special challenges for them. In both mainstream and white supremacist discourse, to be white is to be distinct from those marked as non-white, yet the placement of the distinguishing line has varied significantly in different times and places.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In academic usage, particularly in usage which draws on [[critical race theory]] or [[Intersectionality]], the term "white supremacy" can also refer to a political or socioeconomic system, in which white people enjoy a structural advantage ([[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]]) over other ethnic groups, on both a collective and individual level.

==History==
White supremacy has ideological foundations that date back to 17th-century [[scientific racism]], the predominant paradigm of human variation that helped shape international relations and racial policy from the latter part of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] until the late 20th century (marked by decolonization and the abolition of [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]] in 1991, followed by that country's [[South African general election, 1994|first multiracial elections in 1994]]).

[[File:One side of the monument erected to race prejudice New Orleans Louisiana 1936.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Battle of Liberty Place Monument|Battle of Liberty Place monument]] in Louisiana was erected in 1891 by the white dominated New Orleans government. An inscription added in 1932 states that the [[1876 US Presidential Election]] "recognized white supremacy in the South and gave us our state". It was removed in 2017 and placed in storage.]]

White supremacy was dominant in the [[United States]] both before and after the [[American Civil War]], and it persisted for decades after the [[Reconstruction Era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fredrickson | first = George | title = White Supremacy | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 1981 | isbn = 0-19-503042-7 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[antebellum South]], this included the holding of [[African Americans]] in [[slavery in the United States|chattel slavery]], with four million of them denied freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the end of slavery led to starvation and death for millions of black Americans|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/16/slavery-starvation-civil-war|publisher=The Guardian|date=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of the Civil War saw the desire to uphold white supremacy being cited as a cause for state secession&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_texsec.asp A Declaration of the Causes which Impel the State of Texas to Secede from the Federal Union]: "We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.

In some parts of the United States, many people who were considered non-white were [[disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], barred from government office, and prevented from holding most government jobs well into the second half of the 20th century. Professor Leland T.

The denial of social and political freedom for minorities continued into the mid-20th century, resulting in the [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/kansas-city/press/2013/13-29.html |title=50th Anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom Panel Discussion at the Black Archives of Mid-America |accessdate=October 3, 2015 |format=press release |publisher=The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration |date=August 7, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004044615/http://www.archives.gov/kansas-city/press/2013/13-29.html |archivedate=October 4, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Stephen Klineberg has stated that U.S. immigration laws prior to 1965 clearly declared "that [[Northern European]]s are a superior subspecies of the white race".&lt;ref name="Immigration law"/&gt;  The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional Northern European and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic groups]], and significantly altered the demographic mix in the U.S as a result.&lt;ref name="Immigration law"&gt;{{cite web |title= 1965 immigration law changed face of America |author=Jennifer Ludden |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5391395 |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[U.S. state]]s banned [[interracial marriage]] through [[anti-miscegenation laws]] until 1967, when these laws were invalidated by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]' decision in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''. These mid-century gains had a major impact on white Americans' political views; segregation and white racial superiority, which had been publicly endorsed in the 1940s, became minority views within the white community by the mid-1970s, and continued to decline into 1990s polls to a single-digit percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Racial Attitudes in America: Trends and Interpretations|last1=Schuman|first1=Howard|last2=Steeh|first2=Charlotte|last3=Bobo|first3=Lawrence|last4=Krysan|first4=Maria|date=1997|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-674-74568-1|location=|pages=103ff|quote="The questions deal with most of the major racial issues that became focal in the middle of the twentieth ecntury: integration of public accommodations, school integration, residential integration, and job discrimiantion [and] racial intermarriage and willingness to vote for a black presidential candidate. … The trends that occur for most of the principle items are quite similar and can be illustrated …using attitudes toward school integration as an example.

Some academics argue that outcomes from the 2016 United States Presidential Election reflect ongoing challenges with white supremacy.

In 1937, [[Winston Churchill]] told the Palestine Royal Commission: "I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place." British historian [[Richard Toye]], author of Churchill's Empire, said that "Churchill did think that white people were superior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The 10 greatest controversies of Winston Churchill's career |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29701767 |work=BBC News |date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
[[Nazism]] promoted the idea of a superior [[Germanic people]] or [[Aryan race]] in [[Germany]] during the early 20th century. Notions of white supremacy and Aryan racial superiority were combined in the 19th century, with white supremacists maintaining the belief that white people were members of an Aryan "[[master race]]" which was superior to other races, particularly the [[Jews]], who were described as the "Semitic race", [[Slavs]], and [[Names of the Romani people|Gypsies]], which they associated with "cultural sterility". [[Arthur de Gobineau]], a French racial theorist and aristocrat, blamed the fall of the [[Ancien Régime|''ancien régime'']] in France on racial degeneracy caused by racial intermixing, which he argued had destroyed the "purity" of the Nordic or Germanic race. Gobineau's theories, which attracted a strong following in Germany, emphasized the existence of an irreconcilable polarity between Aryan or Germanic peoples and Jewish culture.&lt;ref&gt;Blamires, Cyprian; Jackson, Paul.

As the [[Nazi Party]]'s chief racial theorist, [[Alfred Rosenberg]] oversaw the construction of a human racial "ladder" that justified [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Hitler's racial and ethnic policies]]. Rosenberg promoted the [[Nordic theory]], which regarded [[Nordic race|Nordics]] as the "master race", superior to all others, including other Aryans (Indo-Europeans).&lt;ref&gt;Though Rosenberg does not use the word "master race". He uses the word "Herrenvolk" (i. e., ruling people) twice in his book ''The Myth'', first referring to the [[Amorite]]s (saying that [[Archibald Sayce|Sayce]] described them as fair skinned and blue eyed) and secondly quoting [[Victor Wallace Germains]]' description of the English in "The Truth about Kitchener". ("The Myth of the Twentieth Century") - Pages 26, 660 - 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg got the racial term ''[[Untermensch]]'' from the title of [[Klansman]] [[Lothrop Stoddard]]'s 1922 book ''The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Stoddard, Lothrop| authorlink = Lothrop Stoddard| year = 1922| title = The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under Man| publisher = [[Charles Scribner's Sons]]| location = New York| isbn =| url = https://archive.org/details/revoltagainstciv00stoduoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later adopted by the Nazis from that book's German version ''Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;

A number of [[Southern Africa]]n nations experienced severe racial tension and conflict during global [[decolonization]], particularly as [[white Africans of European ancestry]] fought to protect their preferential social and political status. Racial segregation in South Africa began in colonial times under the [[Dutch Empire]], and it continued when the British took over the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1795. [[Apartheid]] was introduced as an officially structured policy by the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]]-dominated [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] after the [[South African general election, 1948|general election of 1948]]. Apartheid's legislation divided inhabitants into four racial groups—"black", "white", "coloured", and "Indian", with coloured divided into several sub-classifications.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin-Ragaven, Laurel; London, Lesley; du Gruchy, Jeanelle (1999).

==Academic use of the term==
The term ''white supremacy'' is used in academic studies of racial power to denote a system of structural or [[societal racism]] which privileges white people over others, regardless of the presence or the absence of racial hatred. White racial advantages occur at both a collective and an individual level (''[[ceteris paribus]]'', {{Nowrap|i. e.}}, when individuals are compared that do not relevantly differ except in ethnicity). Legal scholar Frances Lee Ansley explains this definition as follows:
{{quote|By "white supremacy" I do not mean to allude only to the self-conscious racism of white supremacist [[hate group]]s. I refer instead to a political, economic and cultural system in which whites overwhelmingly control power and material resources, conscious and unconscious ideas of white superiority and entitlement are widespread, and relations of white dominance and non-white subordination are daily reenacted across a broad array of institutions and social settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ansley|first=Frances Lee|title=Stirring the Ashes: Race, Class and the Future of Civil Rights Scholarship|journal=Cornell Law Review|year=1989|volume=74|pages=993ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Temple University Press | isbn = 978-1-56639-532-8 | editor1 = Richard Delgado |editor2= Jean Stefancic | last = Ansley | first = Frances Lee | title = Critical white studies: Looking behind the mirror | chapter = White supremacy (and what we should do about it) | date = 1997-06-29 | page = 592}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] educators, such as Betita Martinez and the Challenging White Supremacy workshop, also use the term in this way. The term expresses historic continuities between a pre–[[civil rights movement]] era of open white supremacism and the current racial power structure of the United States. It also expresses the visceral impact of structural racism through "provocative and brutal" language that characterizes racism as "nefarious, global, systemic, and constant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis US | isbn = 978-0-415-98980-0 | editor1 = Jeanette Davidson | editor2 = George Yancy | last = Davidson | first = Tim | title = Critical perspectives on Bell Hooks | chapter = bell hooks, white supremacy, and the academy | date = 2009-02-23 | page = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic users of the term sometimes prefer it to ''racism'' because it allows for a distinction to be drawn between racist feelings and white racial advantage or [[white privilege|privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;"Why is it so difficult for many white folks to understand that racism is oppressive not because white folks have prejudicial feelings about blacks (they could have such feelings and leave us alone) but because it is a system that promotes domination and subjugation?" {{Cite book | publisher = Turnaround Publisher Services Limited | isbn = 978-1-873262-02-3 | last = hooks | first = bell | title = Black Looks: Race and Representation | date = 2009-02-04 | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grillo and Wildman cite hooks to argue for the term ''racism/white supremacy'': "hooks writes that liberal whites do not see themselves as either prejudiced or interested in domination through coercion, and they do not acknowledge the ways in which they contribute to and benefit from the system of white privilege." {{Cite book | publisher = Temple University Press | isbn = 978-1-56639-532-8 | editor1 = Richard Delgado | editor2 = Jean Stefancic | last1 = Grillo | first1 = Trina |author2= Stephanie M.

The term's recent rise in popularity among [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] activists has been characterized by some as counterproductive. [[John McWhorter]], a specialist in language and race relations, has described its use as straying from its commonly accepted meaning to encompass less extreme issues, thereby cheapening the term and potentially derailing productive discussion.&lt;ref name="left language"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/left-language-right-language/|title=Left Language, Right Language|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McWhorter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4584161/white-supremacy/|title=The Difference Between Racial Bias and White Supremacy|website=TIME |last1=McWhorter|first1=John|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://heterodoxacademy.org/2017/12/14/an-interview-with-john-mcwhorter/|title=An Interview with John McWhorter about Politics and Protest|date=2017-12-14|work=HeterodoxAcademy.org|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political columnist [[Kevin Drum]] attributes the term's growing popularity to frequent use by [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]], describing it as a "terrible fad" which fails to convey nuance.

==Ideologies and movements==
Supporters of [[Nordic race#Nordicism|Nordicism]] consider the "Nordic peoples" to be a superior race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordicism|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nordicism|website=Merriam Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century, white supremacy was attached to emerging theories of racial hierarchy. The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] attributed cultural primacy to the white race:
{{quote|The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the [[Brahman]]s, the [[Inca Empire|Incas]], and the rulers of the [[Polynesia|South Sea Islands]]. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur Schopenhauer | title = ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' | year = 1851 | pages = Vol. 2, Section 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] argued in his 1916 book, ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'', that the Nordic race had been responsible for most of humanity's great achievements, and that [[Miscegenation|admixture]] was "race suicide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grant | first = Madison | title = The Passing of the Great Race | publisher = C.

In the United States, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) is the group most associated with the white supremacist movement. Many white supremacist groups are based on the concept of preserving genetic purity, and do not focus solely on [[discrimination]] based on skin color.&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"&gt;http://law.jrank.org/pages/11302/White-Supremacy-Groups.html White Supremacy Groups&lt;/ref&gt; The KKK's reasons for supporting [[racial segregation]] are not primarily based on religious ideals, but some Klan groups are openly [[Protestantism|Protestant]].

[[Nazi Germany]] promulgated white supremacy based on the belief that the [[Aryan race]], or the Germans, were the ''[[master race]]''. It was combined with a [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics programme]] that aimed for [[racial hygiene]] through compulsory sterilization of sick individuals and extermination of [[Untermensch]]en ("subhumans"): [[Anti-Slavic sentiment|Slavs]], Jews and [[antiziganism|Romani]], which eventually culminated in [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Gumkowski, Janusz; Leszczynski, Kazimierz; Robert, Edward (translator) (1961).

[[Christian Identity]] is another movement closely tied to white supremacy.

White supremacist recruitment activities are primarily conducted at a [[grassroots]] level as well as on the [[Internet]]. Widespread access to the Internet has led to a dramatic increase in white supremacist websites.&lt;ref name="Adversity"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=1Adams |first1=Josh |first2=Vincent J. |last2=Roscigno |title=White Supremacists, Oppositional Culture and the World Wide Web |work=University on North Carolina Press 84 (2005): 759–88 |date=20 November 2009 |jstor=3598477}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet provides a venue to openly express white supremacist ideas at little [[social cost]], because people who post the information are able to remain anonymous.

'''Zenitism''' ({{Lang-sh|Zenitizam / Зенитизам}}) was an [[art]] movement in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] from 1921 until 1926, first in [[Zagreb]] from 1921 to 1924 and from 1924 in [[Belgrade]]. The movement was mainly involved in [[visual arts]], [[graphic design]], [[poetry]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[film]], [[architecture]] and [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.nb.rs/zenit/english.html&lt;/ref&gt; Like other avant-garde movements at the time, it held anti-war, anti-bourgeois and anti-nationalist views and rejected traditional culture and art. Micić defined the movement as "abstract metacosmic expressionism."

Most of its ideas were communicated through the [[Zenit (magazine)|Zenit]] magazine which [[Ljubomir Micić]] launched and which published 43 issues.

==The movement==

The movement was established following [[World War I]], during which [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] lost a million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Erlikman, Vadim (2004). Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik. Moscow. {{ISBN|5-93165-107-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some artists from the region were known in Europe, Zenitism was the first notable art movement from the Balkans in Europe.
