The '''anamniotes''' are an informal group comprising the [[fishes]] and the [[amphibians]], the so-called "lower [[vertebrates]]", which lay their [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] in water. They are distinguished from the [[amniote]]s, the "higher vertebrates" ([[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s), which lay their eggs on land or retain the fertilized egg within the mother.

The name refers to the [[amnion]], an embryonic membrane produced during the fetal development of amniotes which serves to transport [[oxygen]] into the egg and expel [[carbon dioxide]]. As the name suggests, anamniotes do not develop an amnion during fetal life and are able to exchange oxygen, carbon dioxide and waste metabolites with the surrounding water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Edwin Harris Colbert |last=Colbert |first=E.

==Anamniote traits==
[[File:Frogspawn closeup.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Anamniote eggs from a [[frog]].]]
The group is characterized by retaining the primitive vertebrate condition in several traits:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Alfred Romer |last=Romer |first=A. S. |first2=T. S. |last2=Parsons |origyear=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |edition=6th |year=1985 |isbn=0-03-058443-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, H.A. (1880): ''Manual of Zoology'', Blackwood And Sons. [http://chestofbooks.com/animals/Manual-Of-Zoology/I-Ichthyopsida.html Original text]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Permeable skin allowing diffusion of water and gases directly through the skin.
* Presence at some period of life of [[gills]]
* Absence of an [[amnion]]
* Absence or rudimentary condition of the [[allantois]]
* [[Nucleated]] [[red blood cells]].

==History of discovery==
The features unifying the anamniotes was first noted by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in 1863, who coined the phrase ''Ichtioid'' or ''Ichthyopsida'' ("fish-face")  for the group.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, T.H. (1876): Lectures on Evolution. ''New York Tribune''. Extra. no 36. In Collected Essays IV: pp 46-138 [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE4/LecEvol.html original text w/ figures]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomic]] classification just below the level of [[Vertebrata]], though Huxley presented the Ichthyopsida as an informal unit and never ventured to forward a [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean rank]] for the group. The term ichthyopsida means ''fish-face'' or ''fish-like'' as opposed to the [[sauropsida]] or ''lizard-face'' animals ([[reptiles]] and [[birds]]) and the [[mammals]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 9th ed. (1878). [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/UnColl/EnBrit/Amphibia.html original text]&lt;/ref&gt;
The group representing an [[evolutionary grade]] rather than a [[clade]], the term anamniote is now used as an informal way of denoting the physical property of the group, rather than as a systematic unit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12598">The '''applied element method''' ('''AEM''') is a numerical analysis used in predicting the [[Linear continuum|continuum]] and [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] behavior of structures.  The modeling method in AEM adopts the concept of discrete cracking allowing it to automatically track [[Structural failure|structural collapse]] behavior passing through all stages of loading: elastic, [[Crack propagation|crack initiation and propagation]] in tension-weak materials, reinforcement [[Yield (engineering)|yield]], element separation, element contact and [[collision]], as well as collision with the ground and adjacent structures.

==History==
Exploration of the approach employed in the applied element method began in 1995 at the [[University of Tokyo]] as part of Dr.Hatem Tagel-Din's research studies. The term "applied element method" itself, however, was first coined in 2000 in a paper called "Applied element method for structural analysis: Theory and application for linear materials".&lt;ref name=AEMTheory&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |authorlink= |last1=Meguro |first1=K. |last2=Tagel-Din |first2=H. |title=Applied element method for structural analysis: Theory and application for linear materials |journal=Structural engineering/earthquake engineering. |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=21–35 |publisher=Japan Society of Civil Engineers(JSCE) |location=Japan |year=2000 |url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200014/000020001400A0511912.php |doi= |id=F0028A |accessdate=2009-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229032846/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200014/000020001400A0511912.php |archivedate=2012-02-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then AEM has been the subject of research by a number of [[academic institution]]s and the driving factor in real-world applications.

==Technical discussion==
In AEM, the structure is divided virtually and modeled as an assemblage of relatively small elements.  The elements are then connected through a set of normal and shear springs located at contact points distributed along the element faces. Normal and shear springs are responsible for the transfer of [[Normal stress|normal]] and [[Shear stress|shear]] stresses from one element to the next.

===Element generation and formulation===
The modeling of objects in AEM is very similar to modeling objects in [[Finite element method|FEM]]. Each object is divided into a series of elements connected and forming a mesh.  The main difference between AEM and FEM, however, is how the elements are joined together.  In AEM the elements are connected by a series of [[Nonlinear system|non-linear]] springs representing the material behavior.

There are three types of springs used in AEM:
*'''Matrix Springs''':  Matrix springs connect two elements together representing the main [[material properties]] of the object.
*'''Reinforcing Bar Springs''':  Reinforcement springs are used to implicitly represent additional reinforcement bars running through the object without adding additional elements to the analysis.
*'''Contact Springs''':  Contact Springs are generated when two elements collide with each other or the ground.  When this occurs three springs are generated (Shear Y, Shear X and Normal).

===Automatic element separation===
When the average strain value at the element face reaches the separation strain, all springs at this face are removed and elements are no longer connected until a collision occurs, at which point they collide together as rigid bodies.

Separation strain represents the strain at which adjacent elements are totally separated at the connecting face. This parameter is not available in the elastic material model. For concrete, all springs between the adjacent faces including reinforcement bar springs are cut. If the elements meet again, they will behave as two different rigid bodies that have now contacted each other. For steel, the bars are cut if the stress point reaches [[Ultimate tensile stress|ultimate stress]] or if the concrete reaches the [[Deformation (mechanics)|separation strain]].

===Automatic element contact/collision===
Contact or collision is detected without any user intervention. Elements are able to separate, contract and/or make contact with other elements. In AEM three contact methods include Corner-to-Face, Edge-to-Edge, and Corner-to-Ground.

==Stiffness matrix==
The spring stiffness in a 2D model can be calculated from the following equations:

: &lt;math&gt;K_n=\frac{E\cdot T\cdot d}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;K_s=\frac{G\cdot T\cdot d}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''d'' is the distance between springs, ''T'' is the thickness of the element, ''a'' is the length of the representative area, ''E'' is the [[Young's modulus]], and ''G'' is the [[shear modulus]] of the material. The above equation's indicate that each spring represents the stiffness of an area (''T''·''d'') within the length of the studied material.

To model reinforcement bars embedded in concrete, a spring is placed inside the element at the location of the bar; the area (''T''·''d'') is replaced by the actual cross section area of the reinforcement bar. Similar to modeling embedded [[steel sections]], the area (''T''·''d'') may be replaced by the area of the steel section represented by the spring.

Although the element motion moves as a [[rigid body]], its internal [[Deformation (engineering)|deformations]] are represented by the spring deformation around each element. This means the element shape does not change during analysis, but the behavior of assembly of elements is deformable.
The two elements are assumed to be connected by only one pair of normal and shear springs. To have a general stiffness matrix, the locations of element and contact springs are assumed in a general position. The stiffness matrix components corresponding to each [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] are determined by assuming a unit [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] in the studied direction and by determining forces at the [[centroid]] of each element. The 2D element stiffness matrix size is 6 × 6; the components of the upper left quarter of the [[stiffness matrix]] are shown below:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
  \sin^2 (\theta+\alpha)K_n &amp; -K_n \sin(\theta+\alpha)\cos(\theta+\alpha) &amp;  \cos(\theta+\alpha)K_s L\sin(\alpha) \\
  +\cos^2(\theta+\alpha)K_s &amp;  +K_s\sin(\theta+\alpha)\cos(\theta+\alpha) &amp; -\sin(\theta+\alpha)K_n L\cos(\alpha) \\
  \\
  -K_n\sin(\theta+\alpha)\cos(\theta+\alpha) &amp; \sin^2(\theta+\alpha)K_s &amp;  \cos(\theta+\alpha)K_n L\cos(\alpha) \\
  +K_s\sin(\theta+\alpha)\cos(\theta+\alpha) &amp; +\cos^2(\theta+\alpha)K_n &amp;  +\sin(\theta+\alpha)K_s L\sin(\alpha) \\
  \\
  \cos(\theta+\alpha)K_s L\sin(\alpha) &amp;  \cos(\theta+\alpha)K_n L\cos(\alpha) &amp; L^2\cos^2(\alpha)K_n \\
  -\sin(\theta+\alpha)K_n L\cos(\alpha) &amp;  +\sin(\theta+\alpha)K_s L\sin(\alpha) &amp; +L^2\sin^2(\alpha)K_s
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The stiffness matrix depends on the contact spring stiffness and the spring location. The stiffness matrix is for only one pair of contact springs. However, the global stiffness matrix is determined by summing up the stiffness matrices of individual pairs of springs around each element. Consequently, the developed stiffness matrix has total effects from all pairs of springs, according to the stress situation around the element. This technique can be used in both [[Structural load|load]] and displacement control cases. The 3D stiffness matrix may be deduced similarly.

==Applications==
The applied element method is currently being used in the following applications:
*Structural vulnerability assessment
**[[Progressive collapse]]
**Blast analysis
**Impact analysis
**[[Seismic analysis]]
*[[Forensic engineering]]
*Performance based design
*Demolition analysis
*Glass performance analysis
*[[Visual Effects|Visual effects]]

The formation and powering of astrophysical jets are highly complex phenomena that are associated with many types of high-energy astronomical sources. They likely arise from dynamic interactions within [[accretion disk]]s, whose active processes are commonly connected with compact central objects such as [[black hole]]s, [[neutron star]]s or [[pulsar]]s. One explanation is that tangled [[magnetic field]]s&lt;ref name="Morabito" /&gt; are organised to aim two diametrically opposing beams away from the central source by angles only several degrees wide {{nowrap|(c. &gt; 1%).&lt;ref name="Kundt"&gt;{{cite journal

Massive central black holes in galaxies have the most powerful jets, but their structure and behaviours are similar to those of smaller galactic [[neutron stars]] and [[black hole]]s. These SMBH systems are often called [[microquasar]]s and show a large range of velocities. [[SS433]] jet, for example, has a velocity of 0.23[[Speed of light|c]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Relativistic jet formation may also explain observed [[gamma-ray burst]]s. Notably, even weaker and less relativistic jets may be associated with many binary systems.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Mechanisms behind the composition of jets remain uncertain,&lt;ref&gt;

==Rotation as possible energy source==
Because of the enormous amount of energy needed to launch a relativistic jet, some jets are possibly  powered by spinning [[black hole]]s. However, the frequency of high-energy astrophysical sources with jets suggest combination of different mechanisms indirectly identified with the energy within the associated accretion disk and X-ray emissions from the generating source. Two early theories have been used to explain how energy can be transferred from a black hole into an astrophysical jet:

Jets may also be observed from spinning neutron stars. An example is pulsar [[IGR J11014-6103]], which has the largest jet so far observed in the [[Milky Way]] Galaxy whose velocity is estimated at 80% the speed of light. (0.8c.) X-ray observations have been obtained but there is no detected radio signature nor accretion disk.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Bay mud''' consists of thick deposits of soft, unconsolidated [[silt]]y [[clay]], which is saturated with [[water]]; these soil layers are situated at the bottom of certain [[estuary|estuaries]], which are normally in [[temperate region]]s that have experienced cyclical [[glacial]] cycles.  Example locations are [[Cape Cod Bay]], [[Chongming Dongtan]] Reserve in [[Shanghai]], [[China]],  [[Banc d'Arguin]]preserve in [[Mauritania]], The [[Bristol Channel]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Mandø Island]] in the [[Wadden Sea]] in [[Denmark]], [[Florida Bay]], [[San Francisco Bay]], [[Bay of Fundy]], [[Casco Bay]], [[Penobscot Bay]], and [[Morro Bay]].  Bay mud manifests low [[shear strength (soil)|shear strength]], high [[compressibility]] and low [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]], making it hazardous to build upon in [[seismic]]ally active regions like the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

Typical bulk density of bay mud is approximately 1.3&amp;nbsp;grams per cubic centimetre.  Bay muds often have a high [[organic matter|organic]] content, consisting of decayed organisms at lower depths, but may also contain living creatures when they occur at the upper soil layer and become exposed by low tides; then, they are called [[mudflat]]s, an important [[ecological]] zone for [[shorebird]]s and many types of marine organisms.  Great attention was not given to the incidence of deeper bay muds until the 1960s and 1970s when development encroachment on certain North American bays intensified, requiring geotechnical design of foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Farzad Naeim, ''The Seismic Design Handbook'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, (2003) {{ISBN|0-7923-7301-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bay mud has its own official geological abbreviation.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd Fusselman, ''Environmental Concerns: Learn the Acronyms'', Trafford Publishing, Victoria, B.C. (2002) {{ISBN|1-55369-461-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The designation for [[Quaternary]] older bay mud is '''Qobm''' and the acronym for Quaternary younger bay mud is '''Qybm'''.  An [[alluvial]] layer is often found overlying the older bay mud.

In relation to shipping channels, it is often necessary to dredge bay bottoms and barge the excavated material to an alternate location.  In this case [[chemical]] analyses are usually performed on the bay mud to determine whether there are elevated levels of [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s or other toxic substances known to accumulate in a [[benthic]] environment.  It is not uncommon to dredge the same [[Channel (geography)|channel]] repeatedly (over a span of ten to thirty years) since further settling sediments are prone to redeposit on an open estuarine valley floor.

==Depositional scenarios==

[[Image:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Decomposed [[diatom]]s are one component of bay mud]]

Bay muds originate from two generalized sources.  First [[alluvial]] deposits of clays, silts and sand occur from streams tributary to a given bay.  The extent of these unconsolidated interglacial deposits typically ranges throughout a given bay to the extent of the historical perimeter [[marshland]]s.  Second, in periods of high glaciation, deposits of silts, sands and organic plus [[inorganic]] [[detritus]] (e.g. decomposition of estuarine [[diatom]]s) may form a separate distinct layer.  Thus bay muds are important time records of glacial activity and streamflow throughout the [[Quaternary]] period.

Some depositional formation is quite recent, such as in the case of Florida Bay, where much of the bay mud has accumulated since 2000 BC, and consists of primarily decayed organic material.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Halley, E.J. Prager, R.P. Stumpf, K.K. Yates, and C.H. Holmes, ''Sea-Level Rise and the Future of Florida Bay in the Next Century'', [[U.S.Geological Survey]], (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of Florida Bay these bay muds can accrete as much as 0.5 to 2.0 centimeters per annum, although the dynamic equilibrium of [[erosion]], [[wave action]] redistribution and deposition complicate the net rate of layer growth. In the case of the [[Bristol Channel]] in the United Kingdom bay, mud formation has been occurring at least since the Eemian Stage (known as the [[Sangamonian Stage]] in [[North America]]), or about 130,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;R.Kirby and W.R.Parker, ''Settled mud deposits in Bridgewater Bay Bristol Channel'', Report no. 107, Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, Surrey, UK (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases such as with [[San Francisco Bay]], deposition has been interrupted by sea-level changes, and strata of vastly different vintages are found. In the San Francisco Bay Area, these are  called [[Young bay mud]] and [[Older bay mud]] by [[geologist]]s. Human activities can also affect deposition; close to half of the Young Bay Mud in San Francisco Bay was placed in the period 1855–1865, as a result of [[placer mining]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] foothills.

==Geotechnical factors==

[[Image:Dakinbldg.jpg|thumb|190px|left|[[Dakin Building]], a national [[headquarters]] use, built on driven [[Deep foundation|piles]] over bay mud]]

Construction on bay mud sites is difficult because of the soil's low strength and high compressibility. Very lightweight buildings can be constructed on bay mud sites if there is a thick enough layer of non-bay-mud soil above the bay mud, but buildings which impose significant loads must be supported on deep foundations bearing on stiffer layers below the bay mud, or obtaining support from friction in the bay mud. Even with deep foundations, difficulties arise because the surrounding ground will likely settle over time, potentially damaging utility connections to the building and causing the entryway to sink below street level.

A number of notable buildings have been constructed over bay muds, typically employing special mitigation designs to withstand seismic risks and settlement issues.  Complicating design issues, fill (beginning about 1850 AD) is sometimes found deposited on the surface level.   For example, the [[Dakin Building]] in [[Brisbane, California]] was designed in 1985&lt;ref&gt;''Judges praise innovative ideas'', San Francisco Examiner, Page F-6,  January 12, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; to sit on piles 150 feet deep, anchoring to the [[Franciscan formation]], below the bay muds and through an upper fill layer.  Furthermore, the structure’s entrance ramp has been set on a giant hinge to allow the surrounding land to settle, while the building absolute height remains constant.  The Crowne Plaza [[high-rise]] [[hotel]] in [[Burlingame, California]]&lt;ref&gt;C.M.Hogan, Kay Wilson, Ballard George, Marc Papineau et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Crowne Plaza Hotel'', prepared by Earth Metrics Inc and. published by the city of  Burlingame, California, circulated by the State of California Clearinghouse, (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; was also designed to sit over bay muds, as was the Westin Hotel in [[Millbrae, California]] and [[Trinity Church, Boston#Art and architecture|Trinity Church]] in Boston's Copley Square. Indeed, Boston's entire [[Back Bay]] district is named for the tidal bay that it now covers. [[Logan International Airport]] and the [[San Francisco International Airport]] are also constructed over bay mud.

[[Image:Bnstiltpair.jpg|thumb|210px|right|[[Black-necked stilt]]s foraging on [[Pickleweed Inlet]] mudflats]]

==Mudflats==
{{main|Mudflat}}
When the mud layer is exposed at the tidal fringe, mudflats result affording a unique [[ecotone]] that affords numerous shorebird [[species]] a safe feeding and resting habitat.  Because the muds function much like [[quicksand]], heavier [[mammal]]ian [[predator]]s not only cannot gain traction for pursuit, but would actually become trapped in the sinking muds. The muds are also an important substrate for primary [[marsh]] productivity including [[Zostera|eelgrass]], [[cordgrass]] and [[pickleweed]]. Furthermore, they are home to a large variety of [[mollusc]]s and estuarine [[arthropod]]s. Richardson Bay, for example, exposes one third of its areal extent as mudflat at low tide, which hosts a productive eelgrass expanse and also a large shorebird community.

Mammals such as the [[Harbor seal]] may use mudflats to haul out of estuary waters; however, larger mammals such as [[humpback whale]]s may become accidentally stranded at low tides. Note that normally humpback whales do not frequent estuaries containing mudflats, but at least one errant whale, publicized by the media as [[Humphrey the whale|Humphrey the humpback whale]], became stuck on a mudflat in San Francisco Bay at Sierra Point in Brisbane, California.

==Worldwide occurrences==

Bay muds occur in bays and estuaries throughout the temperate regions of the world.  In [[North America]], prominent instances are: (a) the Stellwagen Bank formed 16,000 to 9000 BC by glaciation of [[Cape Cod Bay]] in [[Massachusetts]], (b) Florida Bay,(c) in California Morro Bay and San Francisco Bay and (d) Knik &amp; Turnagain Arms in Anchorage, Alaska.  In the [[United Kingdom]] large bay mud occurrences are found at [[Morecambe Bay]], [[Bridgwater Bay]] and Bristol Bay.  Straddling [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]] is the [[Wadden Sea]], a major formation underlain by bay muds.

In Asia the [[Chongming Dongtan]] Nature Reserve in [[Shanghai]], [[China]] is an example of a large scale bay mud formation.  The [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]] of [[Africa]] holds the [[Banc d'Arguin]], a [[World Heritage]] nature preserve in the country of [[Mauritania]].  Banc d'Arguin is a vast area underlain by bay mud.

==Regulatory issues and Actions==

When building on top of bay mud layers or when dredging estuary bottoms, a variety of [[regulatory]] frameworks may arise. Normally in the United States, an [[Environmental Impact Report]] as well as a geotechnical investigation are conducted precedent to any major construction over bay mud.  Combined, these reports have developed much of the data base extant on bay mud characteristics, frequently yielding original field data from soil borings.  These data have demonstrated that in many locations the shallower bay muds contain concentrations of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[lead]], [[chromium]], petroleum [[hydrocarbon]]s, PCBs, [[pesticide]]s and other chemicals which exceed toxic limits: a geological record of human activities of the last century.  These data are particularly important to consider when dredging of bay muds is contemplated as part of a development project. Such dredging can have impacts to receiving lands as [[soil contamination]], but also [[water column]] impacts from sediment disturbance.

In the case of dredging within the [[United States]], a permit is almost always required from the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], after submission of extensive data on the project limits,  chemical properties of the bay muds to be disturbed, a dredge disposal plan and often a complete [[Environmental Impact Statement]] pursuant to the [[National Environmental Policy Act]].  Further review by the [[United States Coast Guard]] would normally be required.  Within individual state jurisdictions, such as [[California]], an Environmental Impact Report must be filed for dredging of any significance; furthermore, agency reviews by the [[California Coastal Commission]] and the [[Regional Water Quality Control Board]] would normally be mandated. All of these regulatory bodies serve an important role in deciding whether an area may be dredged or not. However, the most important body is [[CEQA]], or the California Environmental Quality Act. This guiding legislation is the reason for [[Environmental Impact Report]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, costly mitigation measures and arduous review processes. One of CEQA's main goals is to promote interagency cooperation in the review process of a project. This is one of the main reasons why it is the overseer of all projects in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide to California Planning 4th edition|last=Fulton|first=William|publisher=Solano Press Books|year=2012|isbn=978-1-938-166-02-0|location=Point Arena, California|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For buildings proposed over bay mud layers, typically the municipality involved will, in addition to the usual engineering and design review issues common to all building projects (which are more complicated because of the site conditions), require an Environmental Impact Report [https://web.archive.org/web/20060906222150/http://ceres.ca.gov/topic/env_law/ceqa/guidelines/].  This process would include reviews by that city’s building department, as well as applicable regional and state agencies such as those cited above for dredging projects, except that Coast Guard agencies would not typically be concerned. In developing in California, proposed development over bay mud layers would also have to go through a planning commission and a city council in order to be allowed. This process would respect the EIR, CEQA, and all the other bodies discussed above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Planning for Sustainability 2nd edition|last=Wheeler|first=Stephen|publisher=Routledge Taylor and Francis Group|year=2013|isbn=978-0-415-80988-7|location=New York, NY|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of San Francisco the project would have to get approved by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sfbos.org/about-board|title=About the Board|last=|first=|date=|website=Board of Supervisors|publisher=City and County of San Francisco|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to San Francisco, some interesting negative externalities are being experienced due to the dredging of land by the Bay. The Millennium Towers, which were completed in 2008, are currently sinking. This has had a negative impact on the residents of this building. In response to this subsidence, San Francisco's city attorney has decided to file a lawsuit against the developer, because the developer failed to inform the residents of the accelerated speed that the building was sinking at.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/us/san-francisco-files-lawsuit-against-sinking-millennium-tower.html?_r=0|title=San Francisco Files Lawsuit Against Sinking Millennium Tower|last=Fuller|first=Thomas|date=3 November 2016|website=|publisher=The New York Times|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this lawsuit results in success for San Francisco this could lead to policy changes being made in the future surrounding transparency between developers and potential buyers of the developed land.

== Sea Level Rise ==
Sea level rise in California will also have a huge impact on the ecosystems surrounding and within bays all across the globe. This phenomenon will completely engulf bay mud that makes up Bay Flats. In order to deal with sea level rise the California Coastal Commission has adopted policy guidelines to help California. Attached is a link to this policy document &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coastal.ca.gov/climate/slrguidance.html|title=Sea Level Rise Adopted Policy Guidance|last=|first=|date=12 August 2015|website=|publisher=California Coastal Commission|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Camphill Movement''' is an initiative for social change based on the principles of [[anthroposophy]]. Camphill [[Intentional community|communities]] are residential communities and schools that provide support for the education, employment, and daily lives of adults and children with [[developmental disabilities]], mental health problems, or other special needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2013-10-05/news/42721660_1_camphill-soltane-disabilities-communities At Camphill Kimberton, crafting a different way to live - Pilly.com 2013-10-05]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over 100 Camphill communities in more than 20 countries across [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Southern Africa]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://camphill.net/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310010325/http://camphill.net/# |archive-date=2015-03-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
The movement was founded in 1939 at Kirkton House near [[Aberdeen]] by a group that included [[Austria]]n [[paediatrician]] [[Karl König]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Jackson, The role of [[social pedagogy]] in the training of residential child care workers, ''Journal of Intellectual Disabilities'', 2006 Vol. 10, No. 1, 61-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Holistic Special Education: Camphill Principles and Practice''. 2006, Floris Books, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; It was König's view that every human being possessed a healthy inner personality that was independent of their physical characteristics, including characteristics marking developmental or mental disability, and the role of the school was to recognize, nurture and educate this essential self.&lt;ref name="MH"/&gt; The communities' philosophy, [[anthroposophy]], states that "a perfectly formed spirit and destiny belong to each human being."&lt;ref name="BPR"&gt;Busalle, Rebecca, Cornelius Pietzner, and Stephan Rasch. "The life of the soul". ''Aperture'', Summer 1996 n144: 26(10).&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying principles of König's Camphill school were derived from concepts of education and social life outlined decades earlier by [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophist]] [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861–1925).&lt;ref name="MH"&gt;Marga Hogenboom,''Living With Genetic Syndromes Associated With Mental Disability'', Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are over 100 communities worldwide, in more than 20 countries, mainly in Europe, but also in North America and Southern Africa.&lt;ref name="BPR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd Saunders, ''Ecology and Community Design: Lessons from Northern European Ecological Communities'', Alternatives Journal, Vol 22, Apr/May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://camphill.net/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310010325/http://camphill.net/# |archive-date=2015-03-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Camphill Movement takes its name from Camphill Estate in the [[Milltimber]] area of [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], where the Camphill pioneers moved to with their first community for [[Special education in the United Kingdom|children with special needs]] in June 1940. Camphill Estate is now{{when|date=September 2013}} a campus of Camphill School Aberdeen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071114201243/http://www.prpartnership.co.uk/home/default_press.asp?pageid=247 Report Demonstrates Standards of Excellence at Aberdeen Special Needs School], press release, 12 September 2007.

The study of the '''causes of transsexuality''' investigates [[Gender identity#Factors influencing formation|gender identity formation]] of [[transgender]] people, especially those who are [[transsexual]]. Transsexual people have a gender identity that does not match their [[assigned sex]], often resulting in [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transgender experiences – Information and support|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_097168.pdf|publisher=NHS|accessdate=2012-07-01|author=Curtis, R.|pages=12|format=PDF|date=March 2009|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--this is used to transclude content into [[Transsexual]], [[Transgender]] and potentially other articles--&gt;&lt;section begin="factors" /&gt; The causes of transsexuality have been studied for decades.  The most studied factors are biological. Certain brain structures in trans women have been found to be similar to [[cisgender]] women's as opposed to cis men's, and trans men's have been found to be similar to cis men's, even controlling for [[Hormone therapy|hormone use]], which can also cause trans people's brains to become closer to those of cis people of the same gender. However, these studies are limited as they include a small number of tested individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4158/EP14351.RA |pmid=25667367 |title=Evidence Supporting the Biologic Nature of Gender Identity |journal=Endocrine Practice |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=199–204 |year=2015 |last1=Saraswat |first1=Aruna |last2=Weinand |first2=Jamie |last3=Safer |first3=Joshua }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brain structure differences have also been noted between [[gay]] and [[heterosexual]] men, as well as [[lesbian]] and heterosexual women as part of extensive research on [[biology and sexual orientation]]. Studies have also found that both [[androphilic and gynephilic]] trans women's brain function and responses are like cis women's and unlike cis men's, or are intermediate between the two. Likewise, studies such as Rametti's have found that trans men have male-like white matter patterns (even before using hormones), regardless of sexual orientation.

With regard to genetic factors, a study by Hare reported that trans women have a longer androgen receptor gene than cis men, which is less effective at binding testosterone, potentially preventing complete masculinization of the brain (prenatal androgen exposure or sensitivity, or lack thereof, is an often cited mechanism to explain observed brain-structure differences).&lt;ref name="Hare"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.08.033 |pmid=18962445 |pmc=3402034 |title=Androgen Receptor Repeat Length Polymorphism Associated with Male-to-Female Transsexualism |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=93–6 |year=2009 |last1=Hare |first1=Lauren |last2=Bernard |first2=Pascal |last3=Sánchez |first3=Francisco J |last4=Baird |first4=Paul N |last5=Vilain |first5=Eric |last6=Kennedy |first6=Trudy |last7=Harley |first7=Vincent R }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Bentz found that trans men have a [[CYP17]] allele distribution like cis men and unlike cis women.&lt;ref name="Bentz"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bentz |first1=E |last2=Hefler |first2=L |last3=Kaufmann |first3=U |last4=Huber |first4=J |last5=Kolbus |first5=A |last6=Tempfer|first6=C |title=A polymorphism of the CYP17 gene related to sex steroid metabolism is associated with female-to-male but not male-to-female transsexualism |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=56–9 |year=2008 |pmid=17765230 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.05.056}}&lt;/ref&gt; A twin study published in the ''International Journal of Transgenderism'' found that 33%&lt;!--[[WP:CALC]]: 13+8 / 39+25--&gt; of identical twin pairs were both trans, compared to only 2.6% of non-identical twins who were raised in the same family at the same time, but were not genetically identical.&lt;ref name="TwinH"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2010to2014/2013-transsexuality.html|title = Transsexuality Among Twins: Identity Concordance, Transition, Rearing, and Orientation|last = Diamond|first = Milton|date = May 2013|journal = International Journal of Transgenderism|doi =10.1080/15532739.2013.750222 |pmid = |access-date = 14 June 2015|volume=14|issue=1|pages=24–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental factors have also been proposed. The failure of an attempt to raise [[David Reimer]] from infancy through adolescence as a girl after his genitals were accidentally mutilated is cited as disproving the theory that gender identity is determined by upbringing. [[Ray Blanchard]] developed [[Blanchard's transsexualism typology|a taxonomy of male-to-female transsexualism]] that proposes two distinct etiologies for androphilic and gynephilic individuals that has become highly controversial, supported by [[J. Michael Bailey]], [[Anne Lawrence]], [[James Cantor]], [[Richard F. Docter]] and others, but opposed by [[Charles Allen Moser]], [[Larry Nuttbrock]], [[Julia Serano]], and the [[World Professional Association for Transgender Health]].&lt;section end="factors" /&gt;&lt;!--this is used to transclude content into [[Transsexual]], [[Transgender]] and potentially other articles--&gt;

==Biological factors==

===Genetics===
A 2008 study compared 112 male-to-female transsexuals (both androphilic and gynephilic), mostly already undergoing hormone treatment, with 258 cisgender male controls. Male-to-female transsexuals were more likely than cisgender males to have a longer version of a receptor gene (longer repetitions of the gene) for the sex hormone androgen or testosterone, which reduced its effectiveness at binding [[testosterone]].&lt;ref name="Hare"/&gt; The [[androgen receptor]] (NR3C4) is activated by the binding of [[testosterone]] or [[dihydrotestosterone]], where it plays a critical role in the forming of [[primary sexual characteristics|primary]] and [[secondary sexual characteristics|secondary]] male sex characteristics. The research suggests reduced androgen and androgen signaling contributes to the female gender identity of male-to-female transsexuals. The authors say that a decrease in testosterone levels in the brain during development might prevent complete masculinization of the brain in male-to-female transsexuals and thereby cause a more feminized brain and a female gender identity.&lt;ref name="Hare"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/10/27/2401941.htm|title=Transsexual study reveals genetic link|work=abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant genotype for a gene called [[CYP17A1|CYP17]], which acts on the sex hormones [[pregnenolone]] and [[progesterone]], has been found to be linked to [[female-to-male transsexual|female-to-male]] transsexuality but not MtF transsexuality.  Most notably, the FtM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexuality.&lt;ref name="Bentz"/&gt;

===Transsexuality among twins===
In 2013, a [[twin study]] combined a survey of pairs of twins where one or both had undergone, or had plans and medical approval to undergo, gender transition, with a literature review of published reports of transgender twins. The study found that one third of identical twin pairs in the sample were both transgender: 13 of 39 (33%) monozygotic or identical pairs of [[assigned sex|assigned males]] and 8 of 35 (22.8%) pairs of assigned females. Among dizygotic or genetically non-identical twin pairs, there was only 1 of 38 (2.6%) pairs where both twins were trans.&lt;ref name="TwinH"/&gt; The significant percent of identical twin pairs in which both twins are trans and the virtual absence of dizygotic twins (raised in the same family at the same time) in which both were trans would provide evidence that transgender identity is significantly influenced by genetics if both sets were raised in different families.&lt;ref name="TwinH" /&gt;

===Brain structure===
Several studies have found a correlation between gender identity and brain structure.&lt;ref&gt;For a survey, see Swaab, Dick F.; Castellanos-Cruz, L.; Bao, A.-M. "The Human Brain and Gender: Sexual Differentiation of Our Brains." In: Schreiber, Gerhard. ''Transsexuality in Theology and Neuroscience. Findings, Controversies, and Perspectives.'' Berlin and Boston: Walter de Gruyter 2016 ({{ISBN|978-3-11-044080-5}}), pp. 23-42.&lt;/ref&gt; A first-of-its-kind study by Zhou ''et al.'' (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the [[stria terminalis]] (BSTc), a region which is known for sex and [[anxiety response]]s (and which is affected by prenatal androgens),&lt;ref&gt;Neil R. Carlson, ''Psychology: The Science of Behavior'', Pearson Education, p. 418{{year missing|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; cadavers of six persons who were described as having been male-to-female transsexual or transgender persons in life had female-normal BSTc size, similar to the study's cadavers of [[cisgender]] women. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including cadavers of non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still had sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.&lt;ref name="Zhou/Gooren"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhou |first1=Jiang-Ning |last2=Hofman |first2=Michel A. |last3=Gooren |first3=Louis J. G. |last4=Swaab |first4=Dick F. |title=A sex difference in the human brain and its relation to transsexuality |journal=Nature |volume=378 |issue=6552 |pages=68–70 |year=1995 |pmid=7477289 |doi=10.1038/378068a0|bibcode=1995Natur.378...68Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a follow-up study, Kruijver ''et al.'' (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou ''et al.'' (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MtF subject, who had never gone on hormones, was also included and matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.&lt;ref name="Kruijver"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kruijver |first1=F. P. M. |last2=Zhou |first2=JN |last3=Pool |first3=CW |last4=Hofman |first4=MA |last5=Gooren |first5=LJ |last6=Swaab |first6=DF |title=Male-to-Female Transsexuals Have Female Neuron Numbers in a Limbic Nucleus |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=2034–41 |year=2000 |doi=10.1210/jcem.85.5.6564 |pmid=10843193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a follow-up study by Chung ''et al.'' found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood.  Chung ''et al.'' theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the generation of a gender identity inconsistent with one's assigned sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chung |first1=WC |last2=De Vries |first2=GJ |last3=Swaab |first3=DF |title=Sexual differentiation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in humans may extend into adulthood |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=1027–33 |year=2002 |pmid=11826131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirmed the earlier research as supporting the concept of transsexuality as a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gooren |first1=L |title=The biology of human psychosexual differentiation |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=589–601 |year=2006 |pmid=16870186 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.06.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dick Swaab]] (2004) concurs.&lt;ref name="number11"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Swaab |first1=DF |title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation |journal=Gynecological Endocrinology |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=301–12 |year=2004 |pmid=15724806 |doi=10.1080/09513590400018231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexuality was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou ''et al.'' (1995) and Kruijver ''et al.'' (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MtF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FtM transsexual within the male range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garcia-Falgueras |first1=A. |last2=Swaab |first2=D. F. |title=A sex difference in the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus: relationship to gender identity |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 12 |pages=3132–46 |year=2008 |pmid=18980961 |doi=10.1093/brain/awn276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 [[MRI]] study by Luders et al. of 24 MtF transsexuals not yet treated with cross-sex hormones found that regional [[gray matter]] concentrations were more similar to those of cisgender men than to those of cisgender women, but there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right [[putamen]] compared to cisgender men. Like earlier studies, it concluded that transsexuality was associated with a distinct cerebral pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luders |first1=Eileen |last2=Sánchez |first2=Francisco J. |last3=Gaser |first3=Christian |last4=Toga |first4=Arthur W. |last5=Narr |first5=Katherine L. |last6=Hamilton |first6=Liberty S. |last7=Vilain |first7=Eric |title=Regional gray matter variation in male-to-female transsexualism |journal=NeuroImage |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=904–7 |year=2009 |pmid=19341803 |pmc=2754583 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.03.048}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[MRI]] allows easier study of larger brain structures, but independent nuclei are not visible due to lack of contrast between different neurological tissue types, hence other studies on e.g. BSTc were done by dissecting brains post-mortem.)

An additional feature was studied in a group of FtM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: [[fractional anisotropy]] values for [[white matter]] in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti ''et al.'' (2010) discovered that, "Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract."&lt;ref name=pmid20562024&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.05.006 |pmid=20562024 |title=White matter microstructure in female to male transsexuals before cross-sex hormonal treatment.

Hulshoff Pol ''et al.'' (2006) studied the gross brain volume of 8 male-to-female transsexuals and in 6 female-to-male transsexuals undergoing hormone treatment. They found that hormones changed the sizes of the hypothalamus in a gender consistent manner: treatment with male hormones shifted the hypothalamus towards the male direction in the same way as in male controls, and treatment with female hormones shifted the hypothalamus towards the female direction in the same way as female controls. They concluded: "The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain."&lt;ref name="CSCB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pol |first1=H. E H. |last2=Cohen-Kettenis |first2=P. T |last3=Van Haren |first3=N. E M |last4=Peper |first4=J. S |last5=Brans |first5=R. G H |last6=Cahn |first6=W. |last7=Schnack |first7=H.

Brain-based research has repeatedly shown that female-to-male transsexuals have several male-like characteristics in neuroanatomy. In 2010, a team of neuroscientists compared 18 female-to-male transsexuals with 24 male and 19 female gynephilic controls, using an MRI technique called [[diffusion tensor imaging]] or DTI.&lt;ref name=pmid20562024/&gt; DTI is a specialized technique for visualizing [[white matter]] of the brain, and white matter structure is one of the differences in neuroanatomy between men and women. The study found that the white matter pattern in female-to-male transsexuals was shifted in the direction of biological males, even before the female-to-male transsexuals started taking male hormones (which can also modify brain structure).

Similar [[Biology and sexual orientation#Studies of brain structure|brain structure differences]] have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women.&lt;ref name="LeVay 1991"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=LeVay S |title=A difference in hypothalamic structure between heterosexual and homosexual men |journal=Science |volume=253 |issue=5023 |pages=1034–7 |date=August 1991 |pmid=1887219 |doi=10.1126/science.1887219 |bibcode=1991Sci...253.1034L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Byne 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Byne W, Tobet S, Mattiace LA |title=The interstitial nuclei of the human anterior hypothalamus: an investigation of variation with sex, sexual orientation, and HIV status |journal=Horm Behav |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=86–92 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11534967 |doi=10.1006/hbeh.2001.1680 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also found that circumstance and repeated activities such as [[Research on meditation|meditation]] modify brain structures in a process called brain plasticity or [[neuroplasticity]]. In May 2014, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that parenting "rewires the male brain" for fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1402569111 |pmid=24912146 |pmc=4103311 |title=Father's brain is sensitive to childcare experiences |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=111 |issue=27 |pages=9792–7 |year=2014 |last1=Abraham |first1=Eyal |last2=Hendler |first2=Talma |last3=Shapira-Lichter |first3=Irit |last4=Kanat-Maymon |first4=Yaniv |last5=Zagoory-Sharon |first5=Orna |last6=Feldman |first6=Ruth |bibcode=2014PNAS..111.9792A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain function===

====Androphilic male-to-female transsexuals====
Studies have shown that  [[androphilic]] male-to-female transsexuals show a shift towards the female direction in brain anatomy. In 2009, a German team of radiologists led by Gizewski compared 12 androphilic transsexuals with 12 cisgender males and 12 cisgender females. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), they found that when shown erotica, the cisgender men responded in several brain regions that the cisgender women did not, and that the sample of androphilic transsexuals was shifted towards the female direction in brain responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gizewski |first1 = E.

In another study, Rametti and colleagues used [[diffusion tensor imaging]] (DTI) to compare 18 androphilic male-to-female transsexuals with 19 gynephilic males and 19 androphilic cisgender females. The androphilic transsexuals differed from both control groups in multiple brain areas, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the right anterior cingulum, the right forceps minor, and the right corticospinal tract. The study authors concluded that androphilic transsexuals were halfway between the patterns exhibited by male and female controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rametti | first1 = G. | last2 = Carrillo | first2 = B. | last3 = Gómez-Gil | first3 = E. | last4 = Junque | first4 = C. | last5 = Zubiarre-Elorza | first5 = L. | last6 = Segovia | first6 = S. | last7 = Gomez | first7 = Á. | last8 = Guillamon | first8 = A. | year = 2010 | title = The microstructure of white matter in male to female transsexuals before cross-sex hormonal treatment: A DTI study | url = | journal = Journal of Psychiatric Research | volume =  45| issue = | pages =  949–954| doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gynephilic male-to-female transsexuals====
While MRI taken on [[gynephilic]] male-to-female transsexuals have likewise shown differences in the brain from non-transsexuals, no feminization of the brain's structure have however been identified.
Researchers of the [[Karolinska Institute]] of [[Stockholm]] used MRI to compare 24 gynephilic male-to-female transsexuals with 24 cisgender male and 24 cisgender female controls. None of the study participants were on hormone treatment. The researchers found sex-typical differentiation between the MtF transsexuals and cisgender males, and the cisgender females; but the gynephilic transsexuals "displayed also singular features and differed from both control groups by having reduced [[thalamus]] and [[putamen]] volumes and elevated GM volumes in the [[Insular cortex|right insular]] and [[Inferior frontal gyrus|inferior frontal cortex]] and an area covering the right [[angular gyrus]]".

These researchers concluded that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Contrary to the primary hypothesis, no sex-atypical features with signs of 'feminization' were detected in the transsexual group ... The present study does not support the dogma that [male-to-female transsexuals] have atypical sex dimorphism in the brain but confirms the previously reported sex differences. The observed differences between MtF-TR and controls raise the question as to whether gender dysphoria may be associated with changes in multiple structures and involve a network (rather than a single nodal area).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Savic | first1 = I. | last2 = Arver | first2 = S. | year = 2011 | title = Sex dimorphism of the brain in male-to-female transsexuals | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume =  21| issue = | pages =  2525–2533| doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhr032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Berglund ''et al.'' (2008) tested the response of [[gynephilia|gynephilic]] MtF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexual orientation, the MtFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to the AND pheromone, like the [[androphilia|androphilic]] female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Gynephilic male control groups experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MtF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST. The researchers concluded that in terms of pheromone activation, MtFs occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features.&lt;ref name=pmid18056697&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhm216 |pmid=18056697 |title=Male-to-Female Transsexuals Show Sex-Atypical Hypothalamus Activation when Smelling Odorous Steroids |journal=Cerebral Cortex |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=1900–8 |year=2007 |last1=Berglund |first1=H |last2=Lindstrom |first2=P |last3=Dhejne-Helmy |first3=C |last4=Savic |first4=I }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MtF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.&lt;ref name=pmid18056697/&gt;

====Gynephilic female-to-male transsexuals====
Another team of neuroscientists, led by Nawata in Japan, used a technique called [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) to compare the regional [[cerebral blood flow]] (rCBF) of 11 gynephilic FtM transsexuals with that of 9 androphilic cis females. Although the study did not include a sample of biological males so that a conclusion of "male shift" could be made, the study did reveal that the gynephilic FtM transsexuals showed significant decrease in blood flow in the left anterior cingulate cortex and a significant increase in the right [[Insular cortex|insula]], two brain regions known to respond during sexual arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2009.02059.x |pmid=20132527 |title=Regional cerebral blood flow changes in female to male gender identity disorder |journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=157–61 |year=2010 |last1=Nawata |first1=Hideyuki |last2=Ogomori |first2=Koji |last3=Tanaka |first3=Mariko |last4=Nishimura |first4=Ryoji |last5=Urashima |first5=Hajime |last6=Yano |first6=Rika |last7=Takano |first7=Koichi |last8=Kuwabara |first8=Yasuo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phantom limb syndrome====
[[Phantom limb syndrome]] is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MtF transsexuals do so after [[male-to-female sex reassignment surgery|sex reassignment surgery]]. However, this study overlooks differences between an amputation, where nerves connecting the penis and brain are severed, and reassignment surgery, where some of the penis and scrotum may be reused to create a vaginal canal, labia and a clitoris. In this case, some nerves connecting the genitalia to the brain remain intact. Two thirds of FtM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, complete with phantom erections and other phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramachandran |first=V. S. |title=Phantom Penises In Transsexuals |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=5–16 |year=2008 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=1355-8250&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=5&amp;epage=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prenatal androgen exposure===
Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between [[digit ratio]] (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male-to-female transsexuality. MtF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schneider |first1=H |last2=Pickel |first2=J |last3=Stalla |first3=G |title=Typical female 2nd–4th finger length (2D:4D) ratios in male-to-female transsexuals—possible implications for prenatal androgen exposure |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=265–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16140461 |doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] in persons with XX sex chromosomes results in what is considered to be excess exposure to prenatal [[androgen]]s, resulting in masculinization of the genitalia and, typically, [[Intersex human rights|controversial]] prenatal hormone treatment&lt;ref name="dreger2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11673-012-9384-9 |pmid=22904609 |pmc=3416978 |title=Prenatal Dexamethasone for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia |journal=Journal of Bioethical Inquiry |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=277–294 |year=2012 |last1=Dreger |first1=Alice |last2=Feder |first2=Ellen K |last3=Tamar-Mattis |first3=Anne }}&lt;/ref&gt; and postnatal surgical interventions.&lt;ref name="clayton"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000065490 |pmid=12324718 |title=Consensus Statement on 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency from the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society |journal=Hormone Research in Paediatrics |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=188–95 |year=2002 |author1=Clayton |first1=P.

Research has shown that people with CAH and XX chromosomes will be more likely to be same sex attracted,&lt;ref name="dreger2012" /&gt; and at least 5.2% of these individuals develop serious gender dysphoria.&lt;ref name="erickson-schroth"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erickson-Schroth | first1 = Laura | year = 2013 | title = Update on the Biology of Transgender Identity | url = | journal = Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Mental Health | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 150–74 | doi = 10.1080/19359705.2013.753393 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In males with [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]], conversion of [[testosterone]] to [[dihydrotestosterone]] is disrupted, decreasing the masculinization of genitalia. Individuals with this condition are typically raised as females due to their feminine appearance at a young age. However, more than half of males with this condition raised as females become males later in their life. Scientists speculate that the definition of masculine characteristics during puberty and the increased social status afforded to men are two possible motivations for a female-to-male transition.&lt;ref name="erickson-schroth"/&gt;

The failure of an attempt to raise [[David Reimer]] from infancy through adolescence as a girl after his genitals were accidentally mutilated is cited as disproving this theory that [[gender identity]] is determined by parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Reimer, subject of 'sex reassignment,' dead at 38|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/May/13/ln/ln52a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Colapinto&gt;{{cite book | last = Colapinto  | first = J | title = As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl | publisher = [[Harper Perennial]] | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-06-092959-6 | authorlink = John Colapinto}} Revised in 2006{{pn|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no studies have been able to demonstrate this at a large scale, in part due to widespread agreement among scholars that the Reimer study's methodology was unethical.&lt;ref&gt;http://sciencecases.lib.buffalo.edu/cs/files/gender_reassignment.pdf{{full|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reimer's case is used by organizations such as the [[Intersex Society of North America]] to caution against needlessly modifying the genitals of unconsenting minors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isna.org/faq/reimer Intersex Society of North America | A world free of shame, secrecy, and unwanted genital surgery]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blanchard's theories about sexuality===

By contrast, a 2009 study found that over 90% of cis women are also attracted to the thought of themselves as women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last1=Moser |first1=Charles |title=Autogynephilia in women |year=2009 |pmid=7073469 |doi=10.1080/00918360903005212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In contemporary clinical practice, sexual orientation per se plays only a minor role in treatment protocols or decisions. Also, changes as to the preferred gender of sex partner occur during or after treatment (DeCuypere, Janes, &amp; Rubens, 2005; Lawrence, 2005; Schroder &amp; Carroll, 1999). It can be difficult to assess sexual orientation in individuals with a GI diagnosis, as they preoperatively might give incorrect information in order to be approved for hormonal and surgical treatment (Lawrence, 1999). Because sexual orientation subtyping is of interest to researchers in the field, it is recommended that reference to it be addressed in the text, but not as a specifier. It should also be assessed as a dimensional construct.&lt;ref name="DSM V Workgroup"&gt;from DSM5.org rationale bullet 18.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11363">'''Cell physiology'''  is the biological study about the activities that take place in a cell to keep it alive. This includes, among animal cells, plant cells and microorganisms.  The term "[[physiology]]" refers to all the normal functions that take place in a living organism. All of these activities in the cell could be counted as following ; nutrition, environmental response, cell growth, cell division, reproduction and differentiation. The differences among the animal cell, plant cell and microorganisms shows the essential functional similarity even though those cells have different structures. Absorption of water by roots, production of food in the leaves, and growth of shoots towards light are examples of plant physiology. The [[heterotrophic]] metabolism of food derived from plants and animals and the use of movement to obtain nutrients (even if the organism itself remains in a relatively stationary position) are characteristic of animal physiology.

In the context of [[human physiology]], the term ''cell physiology'' often specifically applies to the physiology of [[cell membrane|membrane]] transport, [[neuron]] transmission, and (less frequently) [[muscle]] contraction. In general, these cover the digestion of food, circulation of blood, and contraction of muscles and, therefore, are important aspects of human physiology. For a more complete description of the general physiological function of human cells (as well as the cells of other life forms), see the article on [[cell biology]].

Experimental approach in cell physiology is an important aspect in cell physiology because it utilizes the experimental methods in order to solve any scientific issue related to physiology. the following examples have been studied in cellular problems by using the experimental method: First, the key of understanding cells' activities in animal, plant cells and microorganisms was studied by identified the nature of organization of cells. Second, the differences of the environment plays a role of the nature of the cell environment, cell resistance and the adjustment. Third, the nature of the cell in regulating and transporting materials into and out the cells crossing the cell membrane. Fourth, Cell foods and its inter-conversions and the mechanism of respiration process to release energy from cell's food. Fifth, the use of energy in respiration in terms of performing the variety types of work. For example, maintenance, readiness, osmotic and for manufacturing of secretions.

The relation of cell physiology to different fields of physiology such as, animal physiology, comparative animal physiology, plant physiology and molecular biology are being fundamental parts of physiology field. Animal physiology plays a role of the work of various organs of the body which those organs coordinate to integrate the animal behavior. medical men in were concerned about vertebrate organ physiology precisely with mammals, because the information provided could be beneficially applied to the physiology of human in health and diseases. it is a beneficial to work on organ physiology as a medical approach. However, the Cellular level can be used as well. In addition, Comparative animal physiology is a part of studying the function of any organ in various types of animals such as, vertebrate and invertebrate to find the fundamental relations. Plant physiology is more likely concerns about the response, nutrition, growth and reproduction of different types of plants. and Since the functioning of the animal and plant depend on the function of the cells component. All of these physiological studies have been recognized by researchers whom were interested in organisms and worked at the cellular level to solve problems at the organs levels. on the other hand, Molecular biology turns to explain the cells activities in at the molecular level.In the past time, it has been limited in studying activities of viruses and bacteria. However, now it is being extended on studying the activities of the Eukaryota cells. Molecular biology has been contributed as an aim for cell physiology by being as powerful source of mutants (this method has been applied to many issues in cell physiology) such as, transportation across the cell membrane and the nature of the membranes. However, many of the cell physiology problems have not been solved by the molecular approach.

==General characteristics of cell physiology==
There are two types of cells: [[Prokaryote]]s and [[Eukaryote]]s.

[[Prokaryotes]] first came into existence and contain no self-contained nucleus, therefore making their mechanisms much simpler compared to the later-evolved [[Eukaryotes]], which do contain a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] enveloping the cell's [[DNA]] and nuclear [[organelles]].  Because [[virus]]es, [[viroid]]s, [[prion]]s and such (see [[Acytota]]/[[Aphanobionta]]) depend entirely on the physiology of other cells (i.e., cells containing their own physiology), the former entities are often not considered to be "living" by the biologists who study them.

All living cells, whether prokaryotes or eukaryotes, contain the following distinguishing characteristics:

* The [[genetic code]] is based on [[DNA]].
** The DNA is composed of four [[nucleotide]]s ([[deoxyadenosine]], [[deoxycytidine]], [[deoxythymidine]] and [[deoxyguanosine]]), to the exclusion of other possible deoxynucleotides.
** The genetic code is composed of three-nucleotide [[codons]], thus producing 64 different codons. Since only 20 [[amino acids]] are used, multiple codons code for the same amino acids. This structure is arbitrary and shared by all [[eukaryotes]] and [[prokaryotes]]. [[Archaea]] and [[mitochondria]] use a similar code with minor differences.
** The DNA is kept double-stranded by a template-dependent [[DNA polymerase]].
** The integrity of the DNA is maintained by a group of maintenance enzymes, including [[DNA topoisomerase]], [[DNA ligase]] and other [[DNA repair]] enzymes. The DNA is also protected by DNA-binding proteins like [[histones]].
* The genetic code is expressed via [[RNA]] intermediates, which are single-stranded. 
** RNA is produced by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] using nucleotides similar to those of DNA with the exception of Thymidine in DNA, replaced by Uridine in RNA. 
* The genetic code is expressed into [[proteins]]. All other properties of the organism (e.g. synthesis of [[lipids]] or [[carbohydrates]]) are the result of protein [[enzymes]].
* Proteins are assembled from free [[amino acids]] by [[Translation (genetics)|translation]] of an [[mRNA]] by [[ribosomes]], [[tRNA]] and a group of related proteins. 
** Ribosomes are composed of two subunits, one big and one small.
** Each ribosomal subunit is composed of a core of [[ribosomal RNA]] surrounded by [[ribosomal proteins]].
** The RNA molecules (rRNA and tRNA) play an important role in the catalytic activity of the ribosomes
* Only 20 [[amino acids]] are used, to the exclusion of countless non-standard amino acids; only the L-[[isomer]]s are used. 
** Amino acids must be synthesized from glucose by a group of specialized enzymes; the synthesis pathways are arbitrary and conserved.
* [[Glucose]] can be used as a source of energy and [[carbon]]; only the D-[[isomer]] is used.
** [[Glycolysis]] goes through an arbitrary degradation pathway.
* [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is used as an energy intermediate.
* The cell is surrounded by a [[cellular membrane]] composed of a [[lipid bilayer]].
* Inside the cell, the concentration of [[sodium]] is lower, and [[potassium]] is higher, than outside. This gradient is maintained by specific [[ion transporter|ion pumps]].The concentration of [[Calcium]] inside of a cell is also lower than outside. 
* The cell multiplies by duplicating all its contents followed by [[cellular division]].

The earliest ancestor of all life that is hypothesized to contain these attributes is known as the [[last common ancestor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5102">{{short description|Physiological response to sudden exposure to cold }}
'''Cold shock response''' is the [[physiological]] response of [[organism]]s to sudden cold, especially cold water.

In humans, cold shock response is perhaps the most common cause of death from immersion in very cold water,&lt;ref name="coldii"/&gt; such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in [[drowning]]. The cold water can also cause [[Acute coronary syndrome|heart attack]] due to [[vasoconstriction]];&lt;ref name=phases /&gt; the heart has to [[Afterload|work harder to pump the same volume of blood]] throughout the body.  For people with existing [[cardiovascular disease]], the additional workload can result in [[cardiac arrest]].  Inhalation of water (and thus drowning) may result from [[hyperventilation]]. Some people are much better able to survive swimming in very cold water due to body or mental conditioning.&lt;ref name="coldii"/&gt;

[[Hypothermia]] from exposure to cold water is not as sudden as is often believed. A person who survives the initial minute of trauma (after falling into icy water), can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they don't drown. However, the ability to perform useful work (for example to save oneself) declines substantially after ten minutes (as the body protectively cuts off blood flow to "non-essential" muscles).&lt;ref name="coldii" /&gt;

==Physiological response==
{{expand section|date=January 2018}}
The physiological response results in temporary breathlessness.

==Conditioning against cold shock==
It is possible to undergo physiological conditioning to reduce the cold shock response, and some people are naturally better suited to swimming in very cold water. Adaptations include the following:
# having an insulating layer of body fat covering the limbs and torso without being overweight;&lt;ref name="coldii" /&gt;
# ability to experience immersion without involuntary physical shock or mental panic;&lt;ref name="coldii" /&gt;
# ability to resist shivering;&lt;ref name="coldii" /&gt;
# ability to raise [[metabolism]] (and, in some cases, increase blood temperature slightly above the normal level);{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
# a generalized delaying of metabolic shutdown (including slipping into unconsciousness) as central and peripheral body temperatures fall.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In these ways, winter swimmers can survive both the initial shock and prolonged exposure. Nevertheless, the human organism is not suited to freezing water: the struggle to maintain blood temperature (by swimming or conditioned metabolic response) produces great fatigue after thirty minutes or less.&lt;ref name="homeostatis" /&gt;

==Cold shock response in bacteria==
Bacteria express a well-defined set of proteins after a rapid decrease in temperature, which differ from those expressed under heat shock conditions. Cold shock proteins may include  helicases, nucleases, and ribosome-associated components that interact with DNA and RNA. Processes such as cold signal perception, membrane adaptation, and the modification of the translation apparatus are involved.&lt;ref name="Weber  2003." /&gt;

{{Collecting Hobby}}

The [[hobby]] of '''collecting''' includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining items that are of interest to an individual ''collector''. Collections differ in a wide variety of respects, most obviously in the nature and scope of the objects contained, but also in purpose, presentation, and so forth. The range of possible subjects for a collection is practically unlimited, and collectors have realised a vast number of these possibilities in practice, although some are much more popular than others.

In collections of manufactured items, the objects may be [[antique]] or simply [[collectable]]. Antiques are collectable items at least 100 years old, while other collectables are arbitrarily recent. The word ''vintage'' describes relatively old collectables that are not yet antiques. Previously commonplace items that are now rare are called [[ephemera]].

Collecting is a childhood hobby for some people, but for others a lifelong pursuit or something started in adulthood. Collectors who begin early in life often modify their aims when they get older. Some novice collectors start purchasing items that appeal to them then slowly work at learning how to build a collection, while others prefer to develop some background in the field before starting to buy items. The emergence of the internet as a global forum for different collectors has resulted in many isolated enthusiasts finding each other.

[[File:Stamp album sleeve.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=text|Stamp album used for [[stamp collecting|collecting stamps]]]]
{{See also|list of collectables}}

The most obvious way to categorise collections is by the type of objects collected. Most collections are of manufactured commercial items, but natural objects such as birds' eggs, butterflies, rocks, and seashells can also be the subject of a collection. For some collectors, the criterion for inclusion might not be the type of object but some incidental property such as the identity of its original owner.

Some collectors are generalists with very broad criteria for inclusion, while others focus on a subtopic within their area of interest. Some collectors accumulate arbitrarily many objects that meet the thematic and quality requirements of their collection, others—called ''completists'' or ''completionists''—aim to acquire all items in a well-defined set that can in principle be completed, and others seek a limited number of items per category (e.g. one representative item per year of manufacture or place of purchase).&lt;ref&gt;For example, book collector [[Rush Hawkins]] (1831 – 1920) sought the first and second books from every European printer before 1501, while illuminated manuscript collector [[Henry Yates Thompson]] (1838 – 1928) maintained a collection of exactly 100 items, selling his least preferable items to make room for new ones.&lt;/ref&gt; The monetary value of objects is important to some collectors but irrelevant to others. Some collectors maintain objects in pristine condition, while others use the items they collect.

==&lt;span id="Price guide"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Value of collected items==
[[File:Herbert Kullmann May 1914 sale catalogue.jpg|thumbnail|Herbert Kullmann, picture sale catalogue by [[Bernheim-Jeune]], Paris, May 1914.]]

After a [[collectable]] has been purchased, its retail price no longer applies and its value is linked to what is called the [[secondary market]]. There is no secondary market for an item unless someone is willing to buy it, and an object's value is whatever the buyer is willing to pay. Depending on age, condition, supply, demand, and other factors, individuals, auctioneers, and secondary retailers may sell a collectable for either more or less than what they originally paid for it. A ''price guide'' is a resource such as a book or website that lists typical selling prices.

Products often become more valuable with age. The term ''[[antique]]'' generally refers to manufactured items made over 100 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] requires that an antique "must be over 100 years of age at the time of importation". {{Cite web|url=https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/359/kw/duty%20on%20antiques/session/L3RpbWUvMTUwODM1NjAyMC9zaWQvY3U0S012dm4%3D|title=Duty on personal and commercial imports of antiques, artwork|last=U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Information Center|first=|date=October 18, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in some fields, such as [[antique car]]s, the time frame is less stringent. For [[antique furniture]], the limit has traditionally been set in the 1830s. Collectors and dealers may use the word ''vintage'' to describe older collectables that are too young to be called antiques,&lt;ref&gt;For example, the arts and crafts sales website [[Etsy]] requires "vintage" items sold on their platform to be "at least 20 years old". {{Cite web|url=https://www.etsy.com/help/article/4946/ref]|title=Vintage Items on Etsy|last=|first=|date=October 18, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Art Deco]] and [[Art Nouveau]] items, [[carnival glass|Carnival]] and [[depression glass|Depression]] glass, etc. Items which were once everyday objects but may now be collectable, as almost all examples produced have been destroyed or discarded, are called ''[[ephemera]]''.

==Psychological aspects==

Psychological factors can play a role in both the motivation for keeping a collection and the impact it has on the collector's life. These factors can be positive or negative.

The hobby of collecting often goes hand-in-hand with an interest in the objects collected and what they represent, for example collecting [[deltiology|postcards]] may reflect an interest in different places and cultures. For this reason, collecting can have educational benefits, and some collectors even become experts in their field.

Maintaining a collection can be a relaxing activity that counteracts the stress of life, while providing a purposeful pursuit which prevents boredom. The hobby can lead to social connections between people with similar interests and the development of new friendships, it has also been shown to be particularly common among academics. 

Collecting for most people is a choice, but for some it can be a compulsion, sharing characteristics with [[Compulsive hoarding|obsessive hoarding]]. When collecting is passed between generations, it might sometimes be that children have inherited symptoms of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]]. Collecting can sometimes reflect a fear of scarcity, or of discarding something then later regretting it. Certain patterns of collection are common among people who have lived through poverty or war.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

It has been speculated{{by who|date=August 2018}} that the widespread appeal of collecting is connected to the hunting and gathering that was once necessary for human survival. Collecting is also associated with memory by association and the need for the human brain to catalogue and organise information and give meaning to ones actions.

==History==
[[Image:Musei Wormiani Historia.jpg|thumb|350px|right|"Musei Wormiani Historia", the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] from the ''Museum Wormianum'' depicting [[Ole Worm]]'s cabinet of curiosities]]

Collecting is a practice with a very old cultural history. In [[Mesopotamia]], collecting practices have been noted among royalty and elites as far back as the third millennium, B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomason |first1=Alison Karmel Thomason |title=Luxury and Legitimation: Royal Collecting in Ancient Mesopotamia |date=2005 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited |location=Hampshire, U.K. |isbn=0754602389}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] collected books from all over the known world at the [[Library of Alexandria]]. The Medici family, in Renaissance Florence, made the first effort to collect art by private patronage, this way artists could be free for the first time from the money given by the Church and Kings; this citizenship tradition continues today with the work of private art collectors. Many of the world's popular [[museum]]s—from the [http://www.metmuseum.org/ Metropolitan] in New York City to the [http://www.museothyssen.org/ Thyssen] in Madrid or the [http://www.franzmayer.org.mx/ Franz Mayer] in Mexico City—have collections formed by the generous collectors that donated them to be seen by the general public.

The collecting hobby is a modern descendant of the "[[cabinet of curiosities]]" which was common among scholars with the means and opportunities to acquire unusual items from the 16th century onwards. Planned collecting of ephemeral publications goes back at least to [[George Thomason]] in the reign of Charles I and [[Samuel Pepys]] in that of Charles II. Collecting engravings and other prints by those whose means did not allow them to buy original works of art also goes back many centuries. The progress in 18th-century Paris of collecting both works of art and of ''curiosité'', dimly echoed in the English ''curios'', and the origins in Paris, Amsterdam and London of the modern [[art market]] have been increasingly well documented and studied since the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Chronologically some essential works are C. Blanc, ''Le trésor de la curiosité'' (1857-58), E. Bonnaffé, ''Les collectionneurs de l'ancienne France'' (1873), l. Courajod, ''La livre-journal de Lazare Duvaux'' (1873), L. Clément de Ris, ''Les amateurs d'autrefois'' (1877), A. Maze-Sencier, ''Le livre des collectionneurs'' (1893), G. Reitlinger ''The Economics of Taste'' (1961), G. Glorieux's monograph, ''À [[l'Enseigne de Gersaint]]'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The involvement of larger numbers of people in collecting activities comes with the prosperity and increased leisure for some in the later 19th century in industrial countries. That is when collecting such items as antique china, furniture and decorative items from oriental countries becomes established. The first price guide was the [[Stanley Gibbons#Stamp catalogues|Stanley Gibbons catalogue]] issued in November 1865.

===On the Internet===

The Internet offers many resources to any collector: personal sites presenting one's collection, online collectable catalogs, dealer/shops websites displaying their merchandise, Internet trading platforms, collector clubs, [[autograph club]], collector forums and collector mailing lists.

'''Cosmic time''' (also known as '''time since the big bang''') is the [[time]] [[coordinate]] commonly used in the [[Big Bang]] models of [[physical cosmology]].  It is defined for [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]], [[Cosmic expansion|expanding]] universes as follows:  Choose a time coordinate so that the universe has the same [[density]] everywhere at each moment in time (the fact that this is possible means that the universe is, by definition, homogeneous).  Measure the passage of time using [[Clock|clocks]] moving with the [[Hubble flow]].  Choose the big bang singularity as the origin of the time coordinate. 

Cosmic time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Cosmology|last=Dodelson|first=Scott|publisher=Academic Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-12-219141-1|location=|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Cosmology|last=Bonometto|first=Silvio|publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing|year=2002|isbn=0750308109|location=Bristol and Philadelphia|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a measure of time by a physical clock with zero [[Peculiar velocity#Cosmology|peculiar velocity]] in the absence of matter over-/under-densities (to prevent time dilation due to relativistic effects or confusions caused by expansion of the universe). Unlike other measures of time such as temperature, redshift, particle horizon, or Hubble horizon, the cosmic time (similar and complementary to the comoving coordinates) is blind to the expansion of the universe. 

There are two main ways for establishing a reference point for the cosmic time. The most trivial way is to take the present time as the cosmic reference point (sometimes referred to as the lookback time) or alternatively, take the [[Big Bang]] as &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; (also referred to as age of the universe). The big bang doesn't necessarily have to correspond to a physical event but rather it refers to the point at which the scale factor would vanish for a standard cosmological model such as ΛCDM. For instance, in the case of inflation, i.e. a non-standard cosmology, the hypothetical moment of big bang is still determined using the benchmark cosmological models which may coincide with the end of the inflationary epoch. For inflationary models, it is not possible to establish a well defined origin of time before the big bang since the universe does not require a beginning event in such models. For technical purposes, concepts such as the average temperature of the universe (in units of eV) or the particle horizon are used when the early universe is the objective of a study since understanding the interaction among particles is more relevant than their time coordinate or age. 

Cosmic time is the standard time coordinate for specifying the [[Friedmann&amp;ndash;Lemaître&amp;ndash;Robertson&amp;ndash;Walker metric|Friedmann&amp;ndash;Lemaître&amp;ndash;Robertson&amp;ndash;Walker solutions]] of [[Einstein's equations]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5077">Within the guidelines of [[halacha]] as presented by [[chazal]] and early rabbinic authorities, '''Oral-vulvar stimulation in Halacha''' (also known as '''נשיקת אותו מקום''' lit. "kissing of that place") is the discussion of whether or not a man may orally stimulate his wife's vulva ([[cunnilingus]]) independent of whether this stimulation does or does not result in her achieving [[orgasm]].

The discussion is within the exclusive framework of a [[halacha|halachically]] permitted marital relationship and only during the time that one's wife is not in her [[Niddah]] state.

==Chazalic views==
{{main|chazal}}
[[Talmud Bavli]] (Nedarim p.&amp;nbsp;20b) quotes the majority of rabbis (who disagree with the fringe view of Yohanan Ben Dahabai) who are lenient by stating that "all that man desires to do with his wife he may" (provided she agrees&lt;ref&gt;Nedarim 20b&lt;/ref&gt;).  The Talmud goes on to bring a parable of a man who makes a meat or fish purchase, that he may cook his purchase in any way he desires.

In a varying text of kallah rabthi as printed in "battei medrashoth"&lt;ref&gt;of the cairo geniza: http://www.hebrewbooks.org/21179 vol. 1 p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Werthheimer notes the significance of the Talmud quoting both meat and fish in its parable;

Since the Torah forbids [[Milk and meat in Jewish law|cooking one's meat in milk]], a parable quoting just meat would not suffice as meat has this restrictive element whereas fish has a lesser restrictive element, thus implying that man has an enhanced level of (sexual) freedom with his wife.

The [[Rambam]] takes a somewhat lenient approach that permits oral-vulvar stimulation but at the same time discourages its actual practice&lt;ref&gt;Rambam mishna commentary to tractate sanhedrin 7:4 (
..כל מה שרוצה לעשות באשתו עושה לפי שהענין..האסור והמותר אינן בענין המרוחק והשנוא והמרוצה והאהוב ומה שראוי לעשות מדרך הצניעות  ותכלית הפרישות), עצי ארזים to shulchan aruch (Rabbi Noach Berlin, 5550) even haezer 25:1.  "ba'athi legani", A. Arbel, published 5771&lt;/ref&gt;

=== During ovulation ===

As stringent view of oral-vulvar stimulation when a woman may conceive is presented in Kallah Rabthi, one of the [[Minor tractate]] in the name of [[Rabbah]]:

{{Quote|Rabbah said.. he let go of his mouth that talks that within it was given the power to kiss and kissed the closed (i.e. the vagina that cannot kiss or talk) therefore the mouth of his offspring will have closed mouths..this applies only if she conceives from that (specific) sexual-relation"|Kallah Rabthi, ch. 1}}

== Regarding the Kohen ==
{{main|Kohen}}
The [[Mordechai HaKohen of Safed|Sifthei Kohen]] (vol. 2 p.&amp;nbsp;244) commentary to the Torah points out that the [[kohen]] personality is to be extra-scrupulous with oral-vulvar stimulation of his wife when producing offspring, as per Rabbi Yochanan's ben Dhabai's warning that it may cause a physical blemish were his wife to conceive; as a kohen is bounded by the Torah rules of [[kohanic disqualifications]], and may be disqualified from specific [[Bet HaMikdash]] services if he has a physical blemish.

== Views of the Achronim ==
{{main|Achronim}}
[[Shulchan Aruch]] (Orach Hayyim ch. 240) takes a stringent view of oral-vulvar stimulation by stating that the transgressor violates the spirit of the Torah verses of והצנע לכת ("Thou shalt walk humbly" -Micha 6:8) and בעבור תהיה יראתו על פניכם לבלתי תחטאו ("So that fear (of God) should be on your faces so that you should not sin" -Exodus 9:16) and of בל תשקצו את נפשותיכם ("Thou should not make your soul despicable" Leviticus 20:25).

== Leniencies ==
The [[Remah]]"s glosses to Shulchan Aruch (Even HaEzer ch. 25)  take a more lenient on oral-vulvar stimulation as does Rabbi [[Joel Sirkis|Yoel Sirkus]] (the "Bach") who permit it in accordance with halacha, but nonetheless discourage its practice.

Rabbi A. Arbel in his work "Ba'athi Legani" points out that the Rambam disagrees that oral-vulvar stimulation violates the spirit of the verse of בל תשקצו, as the average person – during sexual excitement – is not disgusted at the notion of orally stimulating the vulva.

A similar point of view is written by Rabbi Blumenkrants&lt;ref&gt;"baruch tzuri" Sh. Blumenkratz, Brooklyn, 5732 ch. 62&lt;/ref&gt; who states that the [[Remah]], [[Moses ben Isaac Judah Lima|Chelkath Mechokek]] and the [[Aruch HaShulchan]] all agree that one may do with his wife as one desires – including oral-vulvar stimulation – as this is not punishable according to bare-basic halahcha.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14147">'''Digital infinity''' is a technical term in [[theoretical linguistics]]. Alternative formulations are "discrete infinity" and "the infinite use of finite means". The idea is that all human languages follow a simple logical principle, according to which a limited set of digits—irreducible atomic sound elements—are combined to produce an infinite range of potentially meaningful expressions. 

[[Image:Galileos Dialogue Title Page.png|thumb|300px|right|Frontispiece and title page of the ''Dialogue'']]{{quotation|'Language is, at its core, a system that is both digital and infinite. To my knowledge, there is no other biological system with these properties....'|{{Citation|title=''Noam Chomsky''}}&lt;ref name="NoamChomsky"&gt;Noam Chomsky, 1991. Linguistics and Cognitive Science: Problems and Mysteries. in Asa Kasher (ed.), ''The Chomskyan Turn.'' Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 26-53, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quotation|‘It remains for us to examine the spiritual element of speech ... this marvelous invention of composing from twenty-five or thirty sounds an infinite variety of words, which, although not having any resemblance in themselves to that which passes through our minds, nevertheless do not fail to reveal to others all of the secrets of the mind, and to make intelligible to others who cannot penetrate into the mind all that we conceive and all of the diverse movements of our souls.’|{{Citation|title=''[[Antoine Arnauld]] and Claude Lancelot''}}&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Arnauld and Claude Lancelot, 1975 (1660). ''The Port-Royal Grammar.'' The Hague: Mouton, pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Noam Chomsky]] cites [[Galileo]] as perhaps the first to recognise the significance of digital infinity. This principle, notes Chomsky, is "the core property of human language, and one of its most distinctive properties: the use of finite means to express an unlimited array of thoughts". In his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogo]]'', Galileo describes with wonder the discovery of a means to communicate one's "most secret thoughts to any other person ... with no greater difficulty than the various collocations of twenty-four little characters upon a paper." This is the greatest of all human inventions, Galileo continues, comparable to the creations of a Michelangelo...&lt;ref name="NoamChomsky" /&gt;

== The computational theory of mind ==
'Digital infinity' corresponds to Noam Chomsky's '[[universal grammar]]' mechanism, conceived as a computational [[Language module|module]] inserted somehow into ''Homo sapiens''{{'}} otherwise 'messy' (non-digital) brain. This conception of human cognition—central to the so-called '[[cognitive revolution]]' of the 1950s and 1960s—is generally attributed to [[Alan Turing]], who was the first scientist to argue that a man-made machine might truly be said to 'think'. The idea of a thinking machine had previously been considered absurd, having been famously dismissed by [[René Descartes]] as ''theoretically'' impossible. Neither animals nor machines can think, insisted Descartes, since they lack a God-given soul.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Descartes, 1985 [1637]. 'Discourse on the Method.' In ''The Philosophical Writings of Descartes.'' Translated by J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff and D. Murdoch. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Vol. 1, pp. 139-141. &lt;/ref&gt; Turing was well aware of this traditional theological objection, and explicitly countered it.&lt;ref name="Turing"&gt;Alan Turing, 1950. [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]. ''Mind'' 59: 433-60.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today's digital computers are instantiations of Turing's theoretical breakthrough in conceiving the possibility of a man-made ''universal thinking machine''—known nowadays as a '[[Turing machine]]'. No physical mechanism can be intrinsically 'digital', Turing explained, since—examined closely enough—its possible states will vary without limit. But if most of these states can be profitably ignored, leaving only a limited set of relevant distinctions, then ''functionally'' the machine may be considered 'digital':&lt;ref name="Turing"/&gt; {{quotation|'The digital computers considered in the last section may be classified amongst the "discrete-state machines." These are the machines which move by sudden jumps or clicks from one quite definite state to another. These states are sufficiently different for the possibility of confusion between them to be ignored. Strictly speaking, there are no such machines. Everything really moves continuously. But there are many kinds of machine which can profitably be thought of as being discrete-state machines. For instance in considering the switches for a lighting system it is a convenient fiction that each switch must be definitely on or definitely off. There must be intermediate positions, but for most purposes we can forget about them.' |{{Citation|title=''Alan Turing''}}&lt;ref name="Alan Turing"&gt;Alan Turing, 1950. [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]. ''Mind'' 59: 433-60&lt;/ref&gt;}}
An implication is that 'digits' don't exist: they and their combinations are no more than convenient fictions, operating on a level quite independent of the material, physical world. In the case of a ''binary'' digital machine, the choice at each point is restricted to 'off' versus 'on'. Crucially, the intrinsic properties of the [[Media (communication)|medium]] used to encode signals then have no effect on the message conveyed. 'Off' (or alternatively 'on') remains unchanged regardless of whether the signal consists of smoke, electricity, sound, light or anything else. In the case of analog (more-versus-less) gradations, this is not so because the range of possible settings is unlimited. Moreover, in the analog case it ''does'' matter which particular medium is being employed: equating a certain intensity of smoke with a corresponding intensity of light, sound or electricity is just not possible. In other words, only in the case of ''digital'' computation and communication can information be truly independent of the physical, chemical or other properties of the materials used to encode and transmit messages.

Digital computation and communication operates, then, independently of the physical properties of the computing machine. As scientists and philosophers during the 1950s digested the implications, they exploited the insight to explain why 'mind' apparently operates on so different a level from 'matter'. Descartes celebrated distinction between immortal 'soul' and mortal 'body' was conceptualised, following Turing, as no more than the distinction between (digitally encoded) ''information'' on the one hand, and, on the other, the particular physical ''medium''—light, sound, electricity or whatever—chosen to transmit the corresponding signals. Note that the Cartesian assumption of mind's independence of matter implied—in the human case at least—the existence of some kind of digital computer operating inside the human brain. 

{{quotation|'Information and computation reside in patterns of data and in relations of logic that are independent of the physical medium that carries them. When you telephone your mother in another city, the message stays the same as it goes from your lips to her ears even as it physically changes its form, from vibrating air, to electricity in a wire, to charges in silicon, to flickering light in a fibre optic cable, to electromagnetic waves, and then back again in reverse order. ... Likewise, a given programme can run on computers made of vacuum tubes, electromagnetic switches, transistors, integrated circuits, or well-trained pigeons, and it accomplishes the same things for the same reasons.

This insight, first expressed by the mathematician Alan Turing, the computer scientists Alan Newell, Herbert Simon, and Marvin Minsky, and the philosophers Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor, is now called the [[computational theory of mind]]. It is one of the great ideas in intellectual history, for it solves one of the puzzles that make up the 'mind-body problem', how to connect the ethereal world of meaning and intention, the stuff of our mental lives, with a physical hunk of matter like the brain. ... For millennia this has been a paradox. ... The computational theory of mind resolves the paradox.'|{{Citation|title=''Steven Pinker''}}&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, 1997. ''How the Mind Works.'' London: Allen Lane, Penguin, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==A digital apparatus==
Turing did not claim that the human mind really is a digital computer. More modestly, he proposed that digital computers might one day qualify in human eyes as machines endowed with "mind". However, it was not long before philosophers (most notably [[Hilary Putnam]]) took what seemed to be the next logical step—arguing that the human mind ''itself'' is a digital computer, or at least that certain mental "modules" are best understood that way.

[[Noam Chomsky]] rose to prominence as one of the most audacious champions of this 'cognitive revolution'. Language, he proposed, is a computational 'module' or 'device' unique to the human brain. Previously, linguists had thought of language as learned cultural behaviour: chaotically variable, inseparable from social life and therefore beyond the remit of natural science. The Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], for example, had defined linguistics as a branch of 'semiotics', this in turn being inseparable from anthropology, sociology and the study of man-made conventions and institutions. By picturing language instead as the ''natural'' mechanism of 'digital infinity', Chomsky promised to bring scientific rigour to linguistics as a branch of strictly ''natural'' science.

[[Image:Sagittalmouth.png|thumb|300px|right|The human speech apparatus in sagittal section]]In the 1950s, phonology was generally considered the most rigorously scientific branch of linguistics. For phonologists, "digital infinity" was made possible by the human vocal apparatus conceptualised as a kind of machine consisting of a small number of binary switches. For example, "voicing" could be switched 'on' or 'off', as could palatisation, nasalisation and so forth. Take the consonant [b], for example, and switch voicing to the 'off' position—and you get [p]. Every possible phoneme in any of the world's languages might in this way be generated by specifying a particular on/off configuration of the switches ('articulators') constituting the human vocal apparatus. This approach became celebrated as '[[distinctive features]]' theory, in large part credited to the Russian linguist and polymath [[Roman Jakobson]]. The basic idea was that every phoneme in every natural language could in principle be reduced to its irreducible atomic components—a set of 'on' or 'off' choices ('distinctive features') allowed by the design of a digital apparatus consisting of the human tongue, soft palate, lips, larynx and so forth. 

Chomsky's original work was in [[Morphophonology|morphophonemics]]. During the 1950s, he became inspired by the prospect of extending Roman Jakobson's 'distinctive features' approach—now hugely successful—far beyond its original field of application. Jakobson had already persuaded a young social anthropologist—[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]—to apply distinctive features theory to the study of kinship systems, in this way inaugurating 'structural anthropology'. Chomsky—who got his job at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology thanks to the intervention of Jakobson and his student, Morris Halle—hoped to explore the extent to which similar principles might be applied to the various sub-disciplines of linguistics, including syntax and semantics.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1965. ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, pp. 64-127.&lt;/ref&gt; If the phonological component of language was demonstrably rooted in a digital biological 'organ' or 'device', why not the syntactic and semantic components as well? Might not language as a whole prove to be a digital organ or device?

This led some of Chomsky's early students to the idea of '[[generative semantics]]'—the proposal that the speaker generates word and sentence meanings by combining irreducible constituent elements of meaning, each of which can be switched 'on' or 'off'. To produce 'bachelor', using this logic, the relevant component of the brain must switch 'animate', 'human' and 'male' to the 'on' '''(+)''' position while keeping 'married' switched 'off' '''(-)'''. The underlying assumption here is that the requisite conceptual primitives—irreducible notions such as 'animate', 'male', 'human', 'married' and so forth—are genetically determined internal components of the human language organ. While this idea would rapidly encounter intellectual difficulties—sparking controversies culminating in the so-called '[[linguistics wars]]'&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. A. 1993. ''The Linguistics Wars.'' New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;—it attracted young and ambitious scholars impressed by the recent emergence of computer science and its promise of scientific parsimony and unification. If the theory worked, the simple principle of digital infinity would apply to language as a whole. Linguistics in its entirety might then lay claim to the coveted status of ''natural'' science. No part of the discipline—not even semantics—need be contaminated any longer by association with such 'un-scientific' disciplines as cultural anthropology or social science.

'''Engineering fits''' are generally used as part of [[geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]] when a part or assembly is designed. In engineering terms, the "fit" is the clearance between two mating parts, and the size of this clearance determines whether the parts can move independently from each other, or are then temporarily or even permanently joined. Engineering fits are generally described as a "shaft and hole" but are not limited to just round components. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] is the internationally accepted standard for defining engineering fits, but [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] is often still used in North America.

ISO and ANSI both group fits into three categories: clearance, location or transition, and interference. Within each category are several codes to define the size limits of the hole or shaft - the combination of which determines the type of fit. A fit is usually selected at the design stage according to whether the mating parts need to be accurately located, free to slide or rotate, separated easily, or resist separation. Cost is also a major factor in selecting a fit, as more accurate fits will be more expensive to produce, and tighter fits will be more expensive to assemble.

==ISO system of limits and fits==

=== Overview ===
The [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organisation for Standardization]] system splits the three main categories into several individual fits based on the allowable limits for hole and shaft size. Each fit is allocated a code, made up of a number and a letter, which is used on engineering drawings in place of upper &amp; lower size limits to reduce clutter in detailed areas.

=== Hole and shaft basis ===
A fit is either specified as shaft-basis or hole-basis, depending on which part has its size controlled to determine the fit. To elaborate: in a hole-basis system, the size of the hole remains constant and it is the diameter of the shaft that is varied to determine the fit; conversely in a shaft-basis system, the size of shaft remains constant and the hole diameter is varied to determine the fit.

The ISO system uses an alpha-numeric code to illustrate the tolerance ranges for the fit, with the upper-case representing the hole tolerance and lower-case representing the shaft. For example, in H7/h6 (a commonly-used fit) H7 represents the tolerance range of the hole and h6 represents the tolerance range of the shaft. These codes can be used by machinists or engineers to quickly identify the upper and lower size limits for either the hole or shaft. The potential range of clearance or interference can be found by subtracting the smallest shaft diameter from the largest hole, and largest shaft from the smallest hole.

=== Types of fit ===
The three types of fit are:
# Clearance - the hole is larger than the shaft, enabling the two parts to slide and / or rotate when assembled. 
# Location / transition - the hole is fractionally smaller than the shaft and mild force is required to assemble / disassemble 
# Interference - the hole is smaller than the shaft and high force and / or heat is required to assemble / disassemble

== ANSI fit classes (USA Only) ==

=== Interference fits ===

{{main|Interference fit}}

''Interference Fits
', also known as ''Press Fits'' or ''Friction Fits'', are fastenings between two parts in which the inner component is larger than the outer component. Achieving an interference fit requires applying force during assembly. After the parts are joined, the mating surfaces will feel pressure due to friction, and deformation of the completed assembly will be observed.

==== Force fits ====
''Force fits'' are designed to maintain a controlled pressure between mating parts, and are used where forces or torques are being transmitted through the joining point. Like interference fits, force fits are achieved by applying a force during component assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mott|first1=Robert|title=Machine Elements in Mechanical Design|publisher=Pearson|page=495|edition=Fifth|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cat more|Interference fit#Force}}
FN 1 to FN 5

==== Shrink fits ====

''Shrink fits'' serve the same purpose as force fits, but are achieved by heating one member to expand it while the other remains cool. The parts can then be easily put together with little  applied force, but after cooling and contraction, the same dimensional interference exists as for a force fit. Like force fits, shrink fits range from FN 1 to FN 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mott|first1=Robert|title=Machine Elements in Mechanical Design|publisher=Pearson|page=495|edition=Fifth|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cat more|Interference fit#Thermal expansion or contraction}}

=== Location fits ===

Location fits are for parts that do not normally move relative to each other.

==== Location interference fit ==== &lt;!-- The upper case N in interference is intentional to highlight the source and be a memory aid for the N in LN. --&gt;
LN 1 to LN 3  ( or LT 7 to LT 21? {{citation needed|date=January 2016}} )

==== Location transition fit ====
LT 1 to LT 6

==== Location clearance fit====
LC 1 to LC 11

=== RC fits ===
The smaller RC numbers have smaller clearances for tighter fits, the larger numbers have larger clearances for looser fits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobanengineering.com/Tolerances/ANSILimitsAndFits.asp|accessdate=9 September 2013|title=ANSI Standard Limits and Fits (ANSI B4.1-1967,R1974)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== RC1: close sliding fits ====

Fits of this kind are intended for the accurate location of parts which must assemble without noticeable play.

==== RC2: sliding fits ====

Fits of this kind are intended for the accurate location but with greater maximum clearance than class RC1. Parts made to this fit turn and move easily. This type is not designed for free run. Sliding fits in larger sizes may seize with small temperature changes due to little allowance for thermal expansion or contraction.

==== RC3: precision running fits ====

Fits of this kind are about the closest fits which can be expected to run freely. Precision fits are intended for precision work at low speed, low bearing pressures, and light journal pressures. RC3 is not suitable where noticeable temperature differences occur.

==== RC4: close running fits ====

Fits of this kind are mostly for running fits on accurate machinery with moderate surface speed, bearing pressures, and journal pressures where accurate location and minimum play are desired. Fits of this kind also can be described as smaller clearances with higher requirements for precision fit.

==== RC5 and R6: medium running fits ====

Fits of this kind are designed for machines running at higher running speeds, considerable bearing pressures, and heavy journal pressure. Fits of this kind also can be described with greater clearances with common requirements for fit precision.

==== RC7: free running fits ====

Fits of this kind are intended to use where accuracy is not essential. It is suitable for great temperature variations. This fit is suitable to use without any special requirements for precise guiding of shafts.

==== RC8 and RC9: loose running fits ====

This kind of fit is intended for use where wide commercial tolerances may be required on the shaft. With this fits, the parts with great clearances with having great tolerances. Loose running fits exposed to effects of corrosion, contamination by dust and thermal or mechanical deformations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16406">[[File:Distribfaultredudance.PNG|thumb|widthpx|A conceptual design of a segregated-component fault-tolerant computer design]]
'''Fault-tolerant computer systems''' are systems designed around the concepts of [[fault tolerance]]. In essence, they must be able to continue working to a level of satisfaction in the presence of errors or breakdowns.

Fault tolerance is not just a property of individual machines; it may also characterise the rules by which they interact. For example, the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) is designed to allow reliable two-way communication in a [[packet-switched network]], even in the presence of communications links which are imperfect or overloaded. It does this by requiring the endpoints of the communication to ''expect'' packet loss, duplication, reordering and corruption, so that these conditions do not damage data integrity, and only reduce throughput by a proportional amount.

Recovery from errors in fault-tolerant systems can be characterised as either 'roll-forward' or 'roll-back'. When the system detects that it has made an error, roll-forward recovery takes the system state at that time and corrects it, to be able to move forward. Roll-back recovery reverts the system state back to some earlier, correct version, for example using [[checkpointing]], and moves forward from there. Roll-back recovery requires that the operations between the checkpoint and the detected erroneous state can be made [[Idempotence (computer science)|idempotent]]. Some systems make use of both roll-forward and roll-back recovery for different errors or different parts of one error.

== Types of fault tolerance ==
Most fault-tolerant [[computer systems]] are designed to handle several possible failures, including hardware-related faults such as [[hard disk]] failures, [[Input device|input]] or [[output device]] failures, or other temporary or permanent failures; [[software bug]]s and errors; interface errors between the hardware and software, including [[Device driver|driver]] failures; operator errors, such as erroneous keystrokes, bad command sequences or installing unexpected software and physical damage or other flaws introduced to the system from an outside source.&lt;ref&gt;Fault-tolerant computer system design  book contents. Dhiraj K. Pradhan, Pages: 135 – 138 1996 {{ISBN|0-13-057887-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardware fault-tolerance is the most common application of these systems, designed to prevent failures due to hardware components. Most basically, this is provided by [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]], particularly [[dual modular redundancy]]. Typically, components have multiple backups and are separated into smaller "segments" that act to contain a fault, and extra redundancy is built into all physical connectors, power supplies, fans, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Formal Techniques in Real-Time and Fault-Tolerant Systems: Second International Symposium, Nijmegen, the Netherlands, January 8–10, 1992, Proceedings

&lt;/ref&gt; There are special software and instrumentation packages designed to detect failures, such as fault masking, which is a way to ignore faults by seamlessly preparing a backup component to execute something as soon as the instruction is sent, using a sort of voting protocol where if the main and backups don't give the same results, the flawed output is ignored.

Software fault-tolerance is based more around nullifying programming errors using real-time redundancy, or static "emergency" subprograms to fill in for programs that crash. There are many ways to conduct such fault-regulation, depending on the application and the available hardware.&lt;ref&gt;Fault-tolerant computer system design  book contents. Dhiraj K. Pradhan, Pages: 221 – 235 1996 {{ISBN|0-13-057887-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first known fault-tolerant computer was [[SAPO (computer)|SAPO]], built in 1951 in [[Czechoslovakia]] by [[Antonín Svoboda (computer scientist)|Antonín Svoboda]].&lt;ref name="computer-structures"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/bell_gordon/bell.computer_structures_principles_and_examples.1982.102630397.pdf|title=Computer Structures: Principles and Examples|author1=Daniel P. Siewiorek|author2=C. Gordon Bell|author3=Allen Newell|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=1982|isbn=0-07-057302-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} Its basic design was [[Drum memory|magnetic drums]] connected via relays, with a voting method of [[RAM parity|memory error]] detection ([[triple modular redundancy]]). Several other machines were developed along this line, mostly for military use. Eventually, they separated into three distinct categories: machines that would last a long time without any maintenance, such as the ones used on [[NASA]] [[space probe]]s and [[satellites]]; computers that were very dependable but required constant monitoring, such as those used to monitor and control [[nuclear power plants]] or [[Collider|supercollider]] experiments; and finally, computers with a high amount of runtime which would be under heavy use, such as many of the supercomputers used by [[insurance companies]] for their [[probability]] monitoring.

Most of the development in the so-called LLNM (Long Life, No Maintenance) computing was done by NASA during the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/ftcsh/1995/7150/00/00532604.pdf|title=The STAR (Self-Testing And Repairing) Computer: An Investigation Of the Theory and Practice Of Fault-tolerant Computer Design|author1=Algirdas Avižienis|author2=George C. Gilley|author3=Francis P. Mathur|author4=David A. Rennels|author5=John A. Rohr|author6=David K. Rubin}}&lt;/ref&gt; in preparation for [[Project Apollo]] and other research aspects. NASA's first machine went into a [[space observatory]], and their second attempt, the JSTAR computer, was used in [[Voyager program|Voyager]]. This computer had a backup of memory arrays to use memory recovery methods and thus it was called the JPL Self-Testing-And-Repairing computer. It could detect its own errors and fix them or bring up redundant modules as needed. The computer is still working today{{when?|date=February 2017}}.

Hyper-dependable computers were pioneered mostly by [[aircraft]] manufacturers,&lt;ref name="computer-structures"/&gt;{{rp|210}} [[nuclear power]] companies, and the [[rail transport in the United States|railroad industry]] in the USA. These needed computers with massive amounts of uptime that would [[Graceful failure|fail gracefully]] enough with a fault to allow continued operation, while relying on the fact that the computer output would be constantly monitored by humans to detect faults. Again, IBM developed the first computer of this kind for NASA for guidance of [[Saturn V]] rockets, but later on [[BNSF]], [[Unisys]], and [[General Electric]] built their own.&lt;ref name="computer-structures"/&gt;{{rp|223}}

The 1970 [[F14 CADC]] had [[built-in self-test]] and redundancy.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the early efforts at fault-tolerant designs were focused mainly on internal diagnosis, where a fault would indicate something was failing and a worker could replace it. SAPO, for instance, had a method by which faulty memory drums would emit a noise before failure.&lt;ref&gt;Fault tolerant computing in computer design
Neilforoshan, M.R
Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges archive
Volume 18 ,  Issue 4  (April 2003) Pages: 213 – 220, {{ISSN|1937-4771}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later efforts showed that, to be fully effective, the system had to be self-repairing and diagnosing – isolating a fault and then implementing a redundant backup while alerting a need for repair. This is known as N-model redundancy, where faults cause automatic fail safes and a warning to the operator, and it is still the most common form of level one fault-tolerant design in use today.

Voting was another initial method, as discussed above, with multiple redundant backups operating constantly and checking each other's results, with the outcome that if, for example, four components reported an answer of 5 and one component reported an answer of 6, the other four would "vote" that the fifth component was faulty and have it taken out of service. This is called M out of N majority voting.

Historically, motion has always been to move further from N-model and more to M out of N due to the fact that the complexity of systems and the difficulty of ensuring the transitive state from fault-negative to fault-positive did not disrupt operations.

[[Tandem Computers|Tandem]] and [[Stratus Technologies|Stratus]] were among the first companies specializing in the design of fault-tolerant computer systems for [[online transaction processing]].

==Fault tolerance verification and validation==
The most important requirement of design in a [[Fault-tolerant design|fault tolerant]] computer system is making sure it actually meets its requirements for reliability. This is done by using various failure models to simulate various failures, and analyzing how well the system reacts. These [[statistical models]] are very complex, involving probability curves and specific fault rates, [[latency (engineering)|latency]] curves, error rates, and the like. The most commonly used models are HARP, SAVE, and SHARPE in the USA, and SURF or LASS in Europe.

== Fault tolerance research ==
Research into the kinds of tolerances needed for critical systems involves a large amount of interdisciplinary work. The more complex the system, the more carefully all possible interactions have to be considered and prepared for. Considering the importance of high-value systems in transport, [[public utilities]] and the military, the field of topics that touch on research is very wide: it can include such obvious subjects as [[software modeling]] and reliability, or [[hardware design]], to arcane elements such as [[stochastic]] models, [[graph theory]], formal or exclusionary logic, [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]], remote [[data transmission]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;

===Failure-oblivious computing===
''Failure-oblivious computing'' is a technique that enables [[computer programs]] to continue executing despite [[computer memory|memory]] [[data loss|errors]].  The technique handles attempts to read invalid memory by returning a manufactured value to the program, which in turn, makes use of the manufactured value and ignores the former [[computer memory|memory]] value it tried to access.  This is a great contrast to [[RAM parity|typical memory checkers]], which inform the program of the error or abort the program.  In failure-oblivious computing, no attempt is made to inform the program that an error occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

It uses the [[Just-in-time compilation|just-in-time]] [[instrumentation (computer programming)|binary instrumentation]] framework [[Pin (computer program)|Pin]]. It attaches to the application process when an error occurs, repairs the execution, 
tracks the repair effects as the execution continues, contains the repair effects within the application process, and detaches from the process after all repair effects are flushed 
from the process state. It does not interfere with the normal execution of the program and therefore incurs negligible overhead.&lt;ref name=rcv/&gt; For 17 of 18 systematically collected real world null-dereference and divide-by-zero errors, a prototype implementation enables the application to continue to execute to provide acceptable output and service to its users on the error-triggering inputs.&lt;ref name=rcv/&gt;

The '''first-order reliability method''', ('''FORM'''), is a semi-[[probabilistic]] [[reliability engineering|reliability analysis]] method devised to evaluate the reliability of a system.

The accuracy of the method can be improved by averaging over many samples, which is known as [[Line Sampling]].

[[File:Berlin- Light control room at the main hall in the Konzerthaus - 4195.jpg|thumbnail|Light control room]]
In the performing arts, '''front of house''' (FOH) is the part of a performance venue that is open to the public. In [[theater (structure)|theatres]] and live [[music venue]]s, it consists of the [[auditorium]] and [[foyer]]s, as opposed to the [[stage (theatre)|stage]] and [[parts of a theatre#Backstage of offstage|backstage]] areas. In a theatre, the front of house manager is responsible for ticket sales, refreshments, and making sure the auditorium is set out properly.

== Live venues ==
[[Audio engineering|Sound]] operators, excluding the monitor engineers, are normally positioned in a small sectioned-off area front-of-house, surrounded by the audience or at the edge of the audience area. From this position they have unobstructed listening and a clear view of the performance, enabling the operation of the main speaker system, [[show control]] consoles and other equipment. In this case "front of house" can refer to both the general audience/public area or to the specific small section from where the show is mixed.

The front of house speakers are the main speakers that cover the audience, and the front of house desk is the desk that generates the front of house audio mix. In smaller venues the front of house desk may also produce [[foldback (sound engineering)|foldback]] (monitor) mixes for the monitor speakers onstage, whereas in larger venues there will normally be a second mixing desk for monitor control positioned just off the side of the main stage. The audio engineer that designs the front of house sound system and puts it into place for the show/event is the system engineer, and this role is often separate from the person who operates the mixing desk who is often employed by the band directly on larger tours or employed by the venue for smaller tours. The touring engineer is usually assisted by a house sound engineer (employed by the venue) who will be familiar with the installed system of the venue.

In stage lighting, any lighting fixtures that are on the audience side of the [[proscenium arch]] are referred to as being FOH. The lighting operator may also be located in the audience area as well, but are often in a [[lighting booth]].

This term can also refer to the individuals whose primary work is dealing with patrons, including [[House management|house managers]], ticket vendors, bartenders, merchandise vendors, [[Usher (occupation)|usher]]s, and [[museum attendant]]s.

== Origin of gene transfer agents ==

GTA gene clusters are derived from [[bacteriophage]] DNA that has integrated into the host chromosome.  Such [[prophage]]s often acquire mutations that make them unable to produce phage particles, and many bacterial genomes contain one or more such defective prophages that have undergone more-or-less extensive mutation and deletion.  In contrast, gene transfer agents arise when a prophage retains functional structural genes for the phage head and tail, and genes forDNA packaging, but undergoes mutations that remove the genes specifying its regulation and DNA replication, thus placing the structural genes under the control of cellular regulatory systems.

== The ''Rhodobacter capsulatus'' GTA ==

The GTA produced by the [[alphaproteobacteria|alphaproteobacterium]] ''[[Rhodobacter capsulatus]]'', named ''R. capsulatus'' GTA (RcGTA), is currently the best studied GTA. When laboratory cultures of R. capsulatus enter stationary phase, a subset of the bacterial population induces production of RcGTA, and the particles are subsequently released from the cells through [[cell lysis]].&lt;ref name="Foggetal"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fogg | first1 = P.

However, other genes required for RcGTA function, such as the genes required for cell lysis, are located separately.&lt;ref name="Langeetal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Westbyeetal"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Westbye | first1 = A.

Furthermore, the ability of cells to receive genetic material transduced by RcGTA requires a capsular [[polysaccharide]] receptor, which is regulated by the quorum sensing system.&lt;ref name="Brimacombeetal"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brimacombe | first1 = C.

RcGTA-like clusters are found in a large subclade of the alphaproteobacteria, although the genes also appear to be frequently lost by deletion.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, AS and Beatty, JT (2007) "Importance of widespread gene transfer agent genes in alpha-proteobacteria." ''Trends in Microbiology'', 15(2) pp. 54–62.

== The ''Bartonella'' GTA ==

Another known case of a GTA present in alphaproteobacteria is the ''[[Bartonella]]'' GTA (BaGTA). The [[Bartonellaceae]] do not contain RcGTA homologs, but many of the species within this family contain the BaGTA, a GTA that originated from a different bacteriophage. The BaGTA acts jointly with another group of genes of bacteriophage origin, which cause run-off replication, a phenomenon by which replication starts at a prophage replication origin but does not stop at the usual prophage boundaries.&lt;ref name="Berglund2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berglund EC, Frank AC, Calteau A, Vinnere Pettersson O, Granberg F, Eriksson AS, Näslund K, Holmberg M, Lindroos H, Andersson SG |title=Run-off replication of host-adaptability genes is associated with gene transfer agents in the genome of mouse-infecting Bartonella grahamii |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=5 |issue=7 |pages=e1000546 |year=2009 |pmid=19578403 |pmc=2697382 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000546 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The run-off replication causes the amplification of a chromosome region containing genes such as [[secretion system]]s or [[adhesins]].&lt;ref name="Berglund2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guy2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guy L, Nystedt B, Toft C, Zaremba-Niedzwiedzka K, Berglund EC, Granberg F, Näslund K, Eriksson AS, Andersson SG |title=A gene transfer agent and a dynamic repertoire of secretion systems hold the keys to the explosive radiation of the emerging pathogen Bartonella |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=e1003393 |year=2013 |pmid=23555299 |pmc=3610622 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003393 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the higher copy number of this region increases the probability that genes encoding host-association factors will be horizontally transferred. This property distinguishes the mechanisms of the BaGTA and the RcGTA, which have been named to be specialist or generalist GTA systems, respectively. The evolutionary patterns caused by the facilitated horizontal transfer caused by the ''Bartonella'' specialist GTA have been suggested to have caused the ''Bartonella'' radiation, in which these bacteria adapted to commensal or pathogenic lifestyles in various groups of mammalian hosts.&lt;ref name="Guy2013"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5205">'''GenerativeComponents''' is parametric [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]  software developed by [[Bentley Systems]], was first introduced in 2003, became increasingly used in practice (especially by the [[London]] architectural community) by early 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aecmag.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=73 AEC Magazine January 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and was commercially released&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Corporate/News/News+Archive/2007/Quarter+4/Generative+Design.htm Generative Components Commercial release notice]&lt;/ref&gt; in November 2007.  GenerativeComponents has a strong traditional base of users in academia and at technologically advanced design firms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/080318smartgeometry.asp Architectural Record online, March 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  GenerativeComponents is often referred to by the nickname of 'GC'.  GC epitomizes the quest to bring parametric modeling capabilities of 3D solid modeling into architectural design, seeking to provide greater fluidity and fluency than mechanical 3D solid modeling.&lt;ref name="AEC Weekly news magazine"&gt;[http://www10.aeccafe.com/nbc/articles/view_article.php?articleid=478597&amp;page_no=1 AEC Weekly news magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Users can interact with the software by either dynamically modeling and directly manipulating geometry, or by applying rules and capturing relationships among model elements, or by defining complex forms and systems through concisely expressed algorithms.
The software supports many industry standard file input and outputs including [[DGN]] by [[Bentley Systems]], [[.dwg|DWG]] by [[Autodesk]], [[STL (file format)|STL]] (Stereo Lithography), Rhino, and others.  The software can also integrate with [[Building Information Modeling]] systems, specifically and an installed extension/Companion Feature to Bentley's [[AECOsim Building Designer]].

The software has a published API and uses a simple scripting language,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitoolbox.wikidot.com/generativecomponents-library Sample GenerativeComponents script from Ball State University]&lt;/ref&gt; both allowing the integration with many different software tools, and the creation of custom programs by users.

This software is primarily used by architects and engineers in the design of buildings, but has also been used to model natural and biological structures and mathematical systems.

Generative Components currently runs exclusively on [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems, and in English.

Bentley Systems Incorporated offers GC as a free download.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bentley.com/en/products/product-line/modeling-and-visualization-software/generativecomponents  Official GC download page.]&lt;/ref&gt; This version of GC does not time-out and is not feature limited.  It requires registration with an email address. This is a standalone version of GC that includes the underlying Bentley [[MicroStation]] software that is required for it to run.

==SmartGeometry Group==
The [[SmartGeometry Group]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartgeometry.org SmartGeometry Group]&lt;/ref&gt; has been instrumental in the formation of GenerativeComponents.

GenerativeComponents was brought to the market after utilizing a multi-year testing cycle with a dedicated user community in the SmartGeometry group. This community was responsible for shaping the product very early in its life and continues&lt;ref name="AEC Weekly news magazine"/&gt; to play an important role in defining it. The SmartGeometry Group is an independent non-profit organization; it is not a Bentley user group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smartgeometry.org/FAQ SmartGeometry Group FAQ&lt;/ref&gt;

The SmartGeometry Group organizes an annual multi-day workshop and accompanying conference highlighting advanced design practices and technology.  Recent workshop and conferences have been in:

The '''German University of Administrative Sciences Speyer''' (''Speyer University''; [[German language|German]]: ''Deutsche Universität für Verwaltungswissenschaften Speyer'', ''DHV''; formerly known as ''German School of Administrative Sciences''),  is a national [[graduate school]] for [[Public administration|administrative sciences]] and [[public management]] located in [[Speyer]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/|title=About Us|accessdate=2012-04-04|work=Speyer University website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414204816/http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/|archivedate=2012-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1947 by the French occupational authorities as a [[grande école]], today it is operated under the joint responsibility of both the Federal Republic (''Bund'') and [[States of Germany|all 16 German states]] (''Länder'').&lt;ref name  = studies&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/studies.htm|title= Studies|accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt; It runs four [[Master's degree|Master's]] programs, grants [[doctoral degree]]s and [[habilitation]]s, offers a [[postgraduate certificate]] program, and administers programs of [[executive education]]. The school is a major training ground for German and international senior government [[official]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news342669|title=Tomorrow's administrative elite meets in Speyer|accessdate=2012-04-04 | language = German|work=[[Informationsdienst Wissenschaft|The Science Information Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted alumni and faculty include former [[President of Germany]] [[Roman Herzog]], former President of the [[Bundesbank]] [[Helmut Schlesinger]], former [[Attorney General of Germany]] [[Alexander von Stahl]], and [[CEO]] of [[BASF]] [[Jürgen Strube]].

==History==
The school was founded in 1947 as ''École Supérieure d'Administration'' by the French [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupational authorities]] in order to democratize the German senior [[civil service]]. Created as a sister institution to [[École Nationale d'Administration]], it was the first and only German school to employ the French [[grande école]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/beruf-chance/campus/verwaltungshochschule-speyer-gegen-die-inflation-guter-noten-1438407.html|title=Against grade inflation - A portrait of the DHV Speyer |accessdate=2012-04-04 |language = German|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 it was formally established as a German institution of public law with legal capacity and entrusted with "fostering the administrative sciences in education and research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Zur Struktur der deutschen Verwaltung (''On the Structure of German Administration)|year=1967|publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot |location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhv-speyer.de/sfisch/Stefan_Fisch_60_Jahre_DHV.pdf |title=60 years German University of Administrative Sciences Speyer |accessdate=2012-04-04 |format=pdf |language=German |work=Speyer University website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020071354/http://www.dhv-speyer.de/Sfisch/Stefan_Fisch_60_Jahre_DHV.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 and 1970 respectively, it was bestowed with the right to grant [[habilitation]]s and [[doctorate]]s, thereby receiving full university status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhv-speyer.de/Ueberuns/Aufgaben.htm|title= Structure and Tasks |accessdate=2012-04-04 |language = German|work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, the school has had a reputation as an "elite training center".&lt;ref&gt;''"The DHV in Speyer is an elite learning centre of administration (...)"'' {{cite web|url=http://www.m-r-n.com/en/home/research-studies/excellent-colleges.html|title=Excellent colleges|accessdate=2012-04-04|work=Rhine Neckar Metropolitan Region website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224134059/http://www.m-r-n.com/en/home/research-studies/excellent-colleges.html|archivedate=2012-02-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"The German University of Administrative Sciences (DHV) in Speyer ranks among the most renowned elite training centers in the country" ("Die Deutsche Hochschule für Verwaltungswissenschaften (DHV) in Speyer gehört zu den berühmtesten Kaderschmieden im Land")'' {{cite web |url=http://www.bachelorstudium.de/hochschulen/deutsche-hochschule-fuer-verwaltungswissenschaften.html|language = German|title= German University of Administrative Sciences|accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=bachelorstudium.de - An independent study guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"Elite institution between the vines" ("Eliteinstitut zwischen Rebstöcken")'' {{cite web |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/beruf-chance/campus/verwaltungshochschule-speyer-gegen-die-inflation-guter-noten-1438407.html|title=Against grade inflation - A portrait of the DHV Speyer |accessdate=2012-04-04 |language = German|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is the only German university run jointly by the Federal Republic (''Bund'') and [[States of Germany|all 16 German states]] (''Länder'').&lt;ref name="studies"/&gt;

[[Image:Foyer des Gästehauses der Universität Speyer.JPG|thumb|right|238px|Lobby of the Otto Mayer House]]
The university offers programs leading to a [[postgraduate certificate]] and [[master's degree]]s. Furthermore it runs [[Doctorate|doctoral programs]], and administers programs of [[executive education]].&lt;ref name  = studies/&gt;  The language of instruction is predominantly German, although each year a series of seminar courses offered in cooperation with [[Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs]] is delivered in English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~spea/spea_abroad/SPEA_Summer_Abroad/Speyer/index.shtml|title=SPEA in Speyer|accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Indiana University - SPEA website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the cooperation expanded to include the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[USC Sol Price School of Public Policy|Price School of Public Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscontherhine.com/|website=USC |title=Price on the Rhine|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Master's students may earn the [[European Master of Public Administration Consortium|European Master of Public Administration]] [[diploma]] by studying an additional [[semester]] abroad at one of the twelve partner schools in the EMPA network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://empa-network.info/web/|title=The EMPA program|accessdate=2012-04-04|work=EMPA Network website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427051246/http://empa-network.info/web/|archivedate=2012-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The one-term '''postgraduate certificate''' program offers complementary studies in public management. It is aimed at young and future government officials holding a graduate-level degree. It resembles the first semester of the Master of Administrative Sciences program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/studies-3%20Mon.htm|title= The one-term course|accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Master of Administrative Sciences''' (''Magister rerum publicarum'') is the school's traditional flagship program. It is a one-year [[postgraduate]] program open to students holding an additional graduate-level degree, preferably in  law, economics, history, or sociology. Students can choose from some 100 courses that are divided into five policy areas: 1. Public tasks, Organization and Proceedings, 2. Public Management, 3. European and International Affairs, 4. State and Economy, and 5. Higher Education and Research Management. The program comprises two terms at the school, an eight-week internship at German or European institutions, and a subsequent period of three months to write the master's thesis and pass an oral examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/studies-M-P.htm|title= Magister rerum publicarum |accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt; International student enrollment in this program regularly hovers around 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;consisting of 35 % Asian, 30 % European, 25 % African, and 10 % American students (Data as of 2004).{{cite web |url=http://mifkjf.rlp.de/fileadmin/mifkjf/Integration/Daten_und_Fakten/1.ZuwBericht_Teil_C_und_Anhang.pdf|title= Immigration Report - Part C|accessdate=2012-04-04 |language = German|work=Rhineland Palatinate Ministry of Education website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Master of Arts in Administrative Sciences'''  is a two-year interdisciplinary program focusing on public administration in  an international context. First year students follow a core curriculum consisting of six modules on administrative, legal, economic, methodological, and strategic topics, and complete a mandatory eight-week internship. In the second year, students choose courses from the following six optional modules: 1. Government and Administration, 2. Public Policy, 3. Europeanization and Internationalization of Public Administration, 4. Organization and Personnel, 5. Funding of Public Services, and 6. Competition and Regulation in the Infrastructure Sector. At the end of the second year, students complete the master's thesis.&lt;ref name = MAAS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/studies-MasterAS.htm|title= M.A. in Administrative Sciences |accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Master of Arts in Public Economy''' is a two-year program dedicated to the study of the [[Public economics|public economic sector]] from an interdisciplinary perspective. During the first year, students follow the core curriculum of the M.A. in Administrative Sciences. Second-year students complete four deepening modules in Public Finance, Competition and Regulation, Procurement, and Public Corporate Governance, choose one optional module on Public Enterprises, or Infrastructure, and write a master's thesis.&lt;ref name = MAPE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/studies-MasterOEW.htm|title= M.A. in Public Economy |accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both M.A. programs also offer a one-year option for students holding a previous relevant master's degree. The '''Master of Public Administration in Higher Education and Research Management''' is a two-year part-time program for professional university or research institute administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wissenschaftsmanagement-speyer.de/|title= MPA in Higher Education and Research Management |accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university runs '''doctoral programs''' in administrative sciences (''[[Doctor of Science|Doctor rerum publicarum]]''), law (''[[Doctor of Law|Doctor juris]]''), and political sciences and economy (''[[Doctor of Science|Doctor rerum politicarum]]''). Doctoral candidates are required to complete one year of coursework in residence at the school, and produce a dissertation which makes a creditable contribution to scholarship in its field. The dissertation must be supervised by a member of the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/studies-Doc.htm|title= Doctoral studies|accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school's '''executive education''' provides in-service training for senior civil servants of all government levels. The seminars, workshops and conferences deal with contemporary problems of administration, legislation, and European affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=
http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/continuing%20education.htm|title=Executive education|accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Speyer Leadership College''' (''Führungskolleg Speyer'') is a two-year in-service program preparing senior executives holding at least the rank of a ''Government Director''&lt;ref&gt;''Regierungsdirektor (A15)''; equivalent to [[General Schedule (US civil service pay scale)|U.S. GS-14 / O-5 positions]]&lt;/ref&gt; to assume higher positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dhv-speyer.de/fks/index.htm|title=Speyer Leadership College|accessdate=2012-04-04 |language = German|work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admission and fees==
Admission to the school is competitive and is limited to 25 seats per program and year for the M.A. programs, and to 60 seats for the Master in Administrative Sciences program. Formal minimum entry requirement for all degree programs is a [[class rank]] among the top third in the previous [[academic degree]] program. Professional administrative experience is considered an asset. For prospective [[international student]]s, a [[language test]] for German at [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages|CEFR C1 level]] is required.&lt;ref name=MAAS/&gt;&lt;ref name=MAPE/&gt;

The German state heavily subsidizes university study to keep higher education affordable regardless of socio-economic background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unifr.ch/ztd/ems/doc/FAQ_EMS_NC.pdf|title=Test Scores versus School Grades as Selection Criteria: Paternoster-Effect, Filter-Effect, Cost-Benefit-Effects and Effects on the Fairness of Admissions|accessdate=2012-04-20|format = pdf|language = German|work=University of Fribourg website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most German [[public university|public universities]], Speyer charges no [[tuition fee]]s for academic programs, for both [[European Union|EU]] and non-EU citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Note: As of 2012, only public universities in [[Bavaria]] and [[Lower Saxony]] continue to charge tuition fees for undergraduate and academic consecutive graduate programs. {{cite web |url=http://www.bildungsspiegel.de/aktuelles/rheinland-pfalz-neues-hochschulgesetz-soll-studiengebuehren-ab-2012-abschaffen.html?Itemid=262 |title=Rhineland Palatinate: New higher education act to abolish tuition fees from spring term 2012 onwards|accessdate=2012-04-20|language = German|work=bildungsspiegel.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the professional M.P.A. in Higher Education and Research Management program, the school charges  €8,000 in tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://wissenschaftsmanagement-speyer.de/bewerbung-kosten/|title=M.P.A. in Higher Education and Research Management - Application and fees|accessdate=2012-04-20|language = German|work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual housing costs for on-campus [[dormitory|dormitories]] range from €1,560 to €3,240.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dhv-speyer.de/Studium/Vormsemester/Unterbringung.htm|title=Student Dormitories|accessdate=2012-04-20|language = German|work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The university performs "[[fundamental research]] with high relevance to practice", and regularly publishes [[treatise]]s on administrative, legal, political, and economic matters in the Speyer University Monograph Series (''Schriftenreihe der Hochschule Speyer'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/research.htm|title= Research|accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duncker-humblot.de/?ses=f1948bd8fece187fe4c7e8d07976a92c&amp;mnu=200|title=Speyer University Monograph Series - Overview|accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Duncker &amp; Humblot Publishers website}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its 17 chairs dedicated to [[public law|public]] and [[constitutional law]], [[Public administration|administrative sciences]], [[economics]], [[Contemporary history|modern and contemporary history]], [[sociology]], and [[political science]], the school maintains a strategic partnership with the [[German Research Institute for Public Administration]], which is part of the [[Leibniz Association]], and is located on the campus.&lt;ref name  = studies/&gt; It also maintains individual research cooperations with 20 universities in Europe, the Americas, and Asia.

{{Buddhism}}
'''Greco-Buddhism''', or '''Graeco-Buddhism''', is the cultural [[syncretism]] between [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic culture]] and [[Buddhism]], which developed between the 4th century BC and the 5th century AD in [[Bactria]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It was a cultural consequence of a long chain of interactions begun by Greek forays into India from the time of [[Alexander the Great]]. The [[ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] [[satraps]] were then conquered by the [[Mauryan Empire]], under the reign of [[Chandragupta Maurya]]. The Mauryan [[Emperor Ashoka]] would convert to Buddhism and spread the religious philosophy throughout his domain, as recorded in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]]. Following the collapse of the Mauryan Empire, Greco-Buddhism continued to flourish under the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], [[Indo-Greek Kingdoms]], and [[Kushan Empire]]. Buddhism was adopted in Central and Northeastern [[Asia]] from the 1st century AD, ultimately spreading to [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Siberia]], and [[Vietnam]].

{{See also|History of Buddhism}}
The introduction of [[Hellenistic Greece]] started when [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and further regions of [[Central Asia]] in 334 BC. Alexander would then venture into [[Punjab]] (land of five rivers), which was conquered by [[Darius the Great]] before him. Alexander crossed the [[Indus River|Indus]] and [[Jhelum River]] when defeating Porus and appointing him as a satrap following the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]]. Alexander's army would mutiny and retreat along the [[Beas River]] when confronted by the [[Nanda Empire]], thus wouldn't conquer Punjab entirely.

Alexander founded several cities in his new territories in the areas of the [[Amu Darya]] and [[Bactria]], and Greek settlements further extended to the [[Khyber Pass]], [[Gandhara]] (see [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]]), and the [[Punjab]]. Following Alexander's death on June 10, 323&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Diadochi]] or "successors" founded their own kingdoms. General [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] set up the [[Seleucid Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] and [[Central Asia]] and extended as far as India.

The [[Mauryan Empire]], founded by [[Chandragupta Maurya]], would first [[Conquest of the Nanda Empire|conquer the Nanda Empire]]. Chandragupta would then defeat the Seleucid Empire during the [[Seleucid-Mauryan War]]. This resulted in the transfer of the Macedonian satraps in the [[Indus Valley]] and [[Gandhara]] to the Mauryan Empire. Furthermore, a marriage alliance was enacted which granted Seleucus's daughter as Chandragupta's wife for diplomatic relations. The conflict additionally led to the transfer of 500 war elephants to the Seleucid Empire from the Mauryan Empire, presumably as expenses of lives lost and damages sustained.

The Mauryan Emperor Ashoka established the [[List of largest empires in India|largest Indian empire]]. Following the destructive [[Kalinga War]], Ashoka converted to Buddhism. Abandoning an expansionist agenda, Ashoka would adopt humanitarian reformation in place.&lt;ref&gt;The Contribution of the Emperor Asoka Maurya to the Development of the Humanitarian Ideal in Warfare
30-04-1995 Article, International Review of the Red Cross, No. 305, by Gerald Draper&lt;/ref&gt; As ascribed in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], the Emperor spread [[Dharma]] as Buddhism throughout his empire. Ashoka claims to have converted many, including the Greek populations within his realm to Buddhism:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]]'' (S. Dhammika)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The decline and overthrow of the Mauryans by the [[Shunga Empire]], and of the revolt of [[Bactria]] in the Seleucid Empire led to the formation of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] Kingdom (250–125&amp;nbsp;BC). The Greco-Bactrians were followed by the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] (180&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– AD&amp;nbsp;10). Even though the region was conquered by the [[Indo-Scythians]] and the [[Kushan Empire]] (1st–3rd centuries AD), Buddhism continued to thrive.

[[Buddhism in India]] was a major religion for centuries until a major Hindu revival from around the 5th century, with remaining strongholds such as [[Bengal]] largely ended during the [[Islamic invasions of India]].

==Cultural interaction==
{{see also|Hellenistic influence on Indian art}}
The length of the Greek presence in Central Asia and northern India provided opportunities for interaction, not only on the artistic, but also on the religious plane.

===Alexander the Great in Bactria and India (331–325&amp;nbsp;BC)===
[[File:Alexander victory coin Babylon silver c 322 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright|"Victory coin" of [[Alexander the Great]], minted in [[Babylon]] {{circa|322&amp;nbsp;BC}}, following his campaigns in [[India]].&lt;br/&gt;'''Obverse''': Alexander being crowned by [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]].&lt;br/&gt;'''Reverse''': Alexander attacking [[King Porus]] on his elephant.&lt;br/&gt;Silver. [[British Museum]].]]
When Alexander invaded [[Bactria]] and Gandhara, these areas may already have been under [[Śramaṇa|Sramanic]] influence, likely Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]]. According to a legend preserved in the [[Pali Canon]], two [[merchant]] brothers from [[Kamsabhoga]] in Bactria, Tapassu and Bhallika, visited Gautama Buddha and became his disciples. The legend states that they then returned home and spread the Buddha's teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 326 BC, Alexander conquered the Northern region of India. King Ambhi of Taxila, known as [[Taxiles]], surrendered his city, a notable Buddhist center, to Alexander. Alexander fought an epic battle against [[King Porus]] of [[Pauravas]] in the Punjab, at the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC.

===Mauryan empire (322–183&amp;nbsp;BC)===
{{See also|Greco-Buddhist monasticism}}
The Indian emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya]], founder of the [[Maurya Empire]], reconquered around 322&amp;nbsp;BC the northwest Indian territory that had been lost to [[Alexander the Great]]. However, contacts were kept with his Greco-Iranian neighbours in the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Emperor [[Seleucus I Nicator]] came to a marital agreement as part of a peace treaty,&lt;ref&gt;"The whole region from Phrygia to the Indus was subject to Seleucus. He crossed the Indus and waged war with Sandrocottus [Chandragupta], king of the Indians, who dwelt on the banks of that stream, until they came to an understanding with each other and contracted a marriage relationship. Some of these exploits were performed before the death of Antigonus and some afterward." [[Appian]] ''History of Rome'', The Syrian Wars [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_11.html 55]&lt;/ref&gt; and several Greeks, such as the historian [[Megasthenes]], resided at the Mauryan court.

[[File:Pataliputra Palace capital by L A Waddell 1895.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Hellenistic]] [[Pataliputra capital]], discovered in [[Pataliputra]], capital of the [[Maurya Empire]], dated to the 3rd century BC.]]
Chandragupta's grandson Ashoka embraced the Buddhist faith and became a great proselytizer in the line of the traditional Pali canon of Theravada Buddhism, insisting on non-violence to humans and animals ([[ahimsa]]), and general precepts regulating the life of lay people.

According to the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], set in stone, some of them written in Greek&lt;ref&gt;For an English translation of the Greek edicts: {{cite book|title=Religions and Trade: Religious Formation, Transformation and Cross-Cultural Exchange between East and West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXdfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65|date=2 December 2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-25530-2|pages=65–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some in [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]], the official language of the [[Achaemenids]], he sent Buddhist emissaries to the Greek lands in Asia and as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts name each of the rulers of the [[Hellenistic period]]:
{{quote|The conquest by [[Dharma]] has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred yojanas [4,000 miles] away, where the Greek king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochos]] (Antiyoga) rules, and beyond there where the four kings named [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]] (Turamaya), [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos]] (Antikini), [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] (Maka) and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]] (Alikasu[n]dara) rule, likewise in the south among the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], the [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyas]], and as far as [[Tamraparni]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb.13]], Full text of the Edicts of Ashoka. [http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.html See Rock Edict 13] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028175927/http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.html |date=2013-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ashoka also claims he converted to Buddhism Greek populations within his realm:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}
Finally, some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as the famous [[Dharmaraksita]], are described in [[Pali]] sources as leading Greek ("[[Yona]]") Buddhist monks active in Buddhist proselytism (the [[Mahavamsa]], XII&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020052522/http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chap012.html|title=Chapter XII|date=20 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), founding the eponymous [[Dharmaguptaka]] school of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org/index.php?id=62|title=Abstract Sujato: Sects &amp; Sectarianism|website=www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek presence in Bactria (325–125&amp;nbsp;BC)===
{{Main|Greco-Bactrian Kingdom}}
[[File:AiKhanoumAndIndia.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] city of [[Ai-Khanoum]] ({{circa|300}}–145&amp;nbsp;BC) was located at the doorstep of [[India]].]]
Alexander had established in Bactria several cities ([[Ai-Khanoum]], [[Bagram]]) and an administration that were to last more than two centuries under the [[Seleucid Empire]] and the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], all the time in direct contact with Indian territory. The Greeks sent ambassadors to the court of the [[Maurya Empire]], such as the historian [[Megasthenes]] under [[Chandragupta Maurya]], and later [[Deimachus]] under his son [[Bindusara]], who reported extensively on the civilization of the Indians. Megasthenes sent detailed reports on Indian religions, which were circulated and quoted throughout the Classical world for centuries:&lt;ref&gt;Surviving fragments of Megasthenes:[https://web.archive.org/web/20081210080315/http://www.mssu.edu/projectsouthasia/history/primarydocs/Foreign_Views/GreekRoman/Megasthenes-Indika.htm Full text]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Megasthenes makes a different division of the philosophers, saying that they are of two kinds, one of which he calls the [[Brahman|Brachmanes]], and the other the [[Sramana|Sarmanes]]..." [[Strabo]] XV. 1. 58-60&lt;ref name="Strabo XV.1"/&gt;}}
The Greco-Bactrians maintained a strong Hellenistic culture at the door of India during the rule of the Maurya Empire in India, as exemplified by the archaeological site of [[Ai-Khanoum]]. When the Maurya Empire was toppled by the [[Shunga Empire]] around 180 BC, the Greco-Bactrians expanded into India, where they established the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]], under which Buddhism was able to flourish.

===Indo-Greek Kingdom and Buddhism (180&amp;nbsp;BC – AD&amp;nbsp;10)===
[[File:Greek Gods and Dharmachakra.jpg|thumb|350px|Greek Gods and the "Wheel of the Law" or [[Dharmachakra]]: '''Left:''' [[Zeus]] holding [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], who hands a victory [[wreath]] over a Dharmachakra (coin of [[Menander II]]). '''Right:''' Divinity wearing [[chlamys]] and [[petasus]] pushing a Dharmachakra, with legend "He who sets in motion the Wheel of the Law" ([[Tillya Tepe Buddhist coin]]).]]
{{Main|Indo-Greek Kingdom}}
The Greco-Bactrians conquered parts of [[North India]] from 180&amp;nbsp;BC, whence they are known as the Indo-Greeks. They controlled various areas of the northern Indian territory until AD&amp;nbsp;10.

Buddhism prospered under the Indo-Greek kings, and it has been suggested that their invasion of India was intended to protect the Buddhist faith from the religious persecutions of the [[Shunga Empire|Shungas]] (185–73&amp;nbsp;BC), who had overthrown the Mauryans. [[Zarmanochegas]] was a śramana (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as [[Strabo]], [[Cassius Dio]] and [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] traveled to [[Antioch]] and [[Athens]] while [[Augustus]] (died AD&amp;nbsp;14) was ruling the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;Strabo, xv, 1, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;layout=&amp;loc=15.1.73 on the immolation of the Sramana in Athens (Paragraph 73)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liv, 9"&gt;[[Dio Cassius]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#9 liv, 9].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coinage====
The coins of the Indo-Greek king [[Menander I]] (reigned 160–135&amp;nbsp;BC), found from [[Afghanistan]] to central India, bear the inscription "Saviour King Menander" in Greek on the front. Several Indo-Greek kings after Menander, such as [[Zoilos I]], [[Strato I]], [[Heliokles II]], [[Theophilos (king)|Theophilos]], [[Peukolaos]], [[Menander II]] and [[Archebius]] display on their coins the title "Maharajasa Dharmika" (lit. "King of the Dharma") in [[Prakrit]] written in [[Kharoshthi]].

Some of the coins of Menander I and [[Menander II]] incorporate the Buddhist symbol of the eight-spoked wheel, associated with the Greek symbols of victory, either the palm of victory, or the victory wreath handed over by the goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]. According to the [[Milinda Panha|Milinda Pañha]], at the end of his reign Menander I became a Buddhist [[arhat]],&lt;ref&gt;Extract of the [[Milinda Panha]]: "And afterwards, taking delight in the wisdom of the Elder, he handed over his kingdom to his son, and abandoning the household life for the houseless state, grew great in insight, and himself attained to [[Arhat|Arahatship]]!" ([[Milinda Panha|The Questions of King Milinda]], Translation by [[Thomas William Rhys Davids|T. W. Rhys Davids]], 1890)&lt;/ref&gt; a fact also echoed by [[Plutarch]], who explains that his relics were shared and enshrined.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch on Menander: "But when one Menander, who had reigned graciously over the Bactrians, died afterwards in the camp, the cities indeed by common consent celebrated his funerals; but coming to a contest about his relics, they were difficultly at last brought to this agreement, that his ashes being distributed, everyone should carry away an equal share, and they should all erect monuments to him." (Plutarch, "Political Precepts" Praec. reip. ger. 28, 6) p147–148 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220090138/http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/Plutarch0206/Morals/0062-05_Bk.pdf Full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MenanderChakra.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A coin of [[Menander I]] (r.160–135 BC) with a [[dharmacakra]] and a palm.]]

The ubiquitous symbol of the elephant in Indo-Greek coinage may also have been associated with Buddhism, as suggested by the parallel between coins of [[Antialcidas]] and [[Menander II]], where the elephant in the coins of Antialcidas holds the same relationship to Zeus and Nike as the Buddhist wheel on the coins of Menander II. When the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]] invaded North India in the 1st century AD, they adopted a large part of the symbolism of Indo-Greek coinage, but refrained from ever using the elephant, suggesting that its meaning was not merely geographical.

Finally, after the reign of Menander I, several Indo-Greek rulers, such as [[Amyntas Nikator]], [[Nicias (Indo-Greek king)|Nicias]], [[Peukolaos]], [[Hermaeus]], [[Hippostratos]] and [[Menander II]], depicted themselves or their Greek deities forming with the right hand a benediction gesture identical to the Buddhist vitarka [[mudra]] (thumb and index joined together, with other fingers extended), which in Buddhism signifies the transmission of Buddha's teaching.

====Cities====
According to [[Ptolemy]], Greek cities were founded by the Greco-Bactrians in northern [[India]]. Menander established his capital in [[Sagala]] (modern [[Sialkot]], [[Punjab, Pakistan]]) one of the centers of the blossoming [[Buddhist culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Milinda Panha]], Chap. I&lt;/ref&gt; A large Greek city built by [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]] and rebuilt by Menander has been excavated at the archaeological site of [[Sirkap]] near [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]], where Buddhist [[stupa]]s were standing side-by-side with [[Hindu]] and [[Ancient Greek temple|Greek temples]], indicating religious tolerance and syncretism.

====Scriptures====
Evidence of direct religious interaction between Greek and Buddhist thought during the period include the ''[[Milinda Pañha]]'' or "Questions of Menander", a Pali-language discourse in the [[Platonism|Platonic style]] held between Menander I and the Buddhist monk [[Nagasena]].

[[File:Ruvanvelisaya Dagoba.jpg|thumb|According to the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', the [[Ruwanwelisaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], [[Sri Lanka]], was dedicated by a 30,000-strong [[Yona]] delegation from [[Alexandria on the Caucasus]] around 130&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
The ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', chapter 29, records that during Menander's reign, a Greek ''thera'' (elder monk) named ''[[Mahadharmaraksita]]'' led 30,000 Buddhist monks from "the Greek city of Alexandria" (possibly [[Alexandria on the Caucasus]], around {{convert|150|km}} north of today's [[Kabul]] in Afghanistan), to [[Sri Lanka]] for the dedication of a stupa, indicating that Buddhism flourished in Menander's territory and that Greeks took a very active part in it.&lt;ref name="McEvilley2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas  McEvilley|title=The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbjelOMYyN8C&amp;pg=PT558|date=7 February 2012|publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson|isbn=978-1-58115-933-2|pages=558–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Buddhist dedications by Greeks in India are recorded, such as that of the Greek [[meridarch]] (civil governor of a province) named [[Theodorus (meridarch)|Theodorus]], describing in Kharosthi how he enshrined [[śarīra|relics of the Buddha]]. The inscriptions were found on a vase inside a stupa, dated to the reign of Menander or one of his successors in the 1st century BC.&lt;ref name="Tarn2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tarn|first=William Woodthorpe|title=The Greeks in Bactria and India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-HeJS3nE9cAC|date=24 June 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-00941-6|page=391|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Buddhist tradition recognizes Menander as one of the great benefactors of the faith, together with Ashoka and [[Kanishka the Great]].

Buddhist manuscripts in cursive Greek have been found in Afghanistan, praising various Buddhas and including mentions of the [[Mahayana]] figure of "[[Avalokiteśvara|Lokesvara]]raja Buddha" ({{lang|grc|λωγοασφαροραζοβοδδο}}). These manuscripts have been dated later than the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Sims-Williams, "A Bactrian Buddhist Manuscript"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kushan empire (1st–3rd century AD)===
{{Main|Kushan Empire}}
The [[Kushan Empire]], one of the five tribes of the [[Yuezhi]], settled in [[Bactria]] around 125&amp;nbsp;BC, displacing the Greco-Bactrians and invading the northern parts of Pakistan and India from around AD&amp;nbsp;1. By that time they had already been in contact with Greek culture and the Indo-Greek kingdoms for more than a century. They used the Greek script to write their language, as exemplified by their [[coin]]s and their adoption of the [[Greek alphabet]].

[[File:Indo-GreekBanquet.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Hellenistic culture in the Indian subcontinent: Greek clothes, [[amphora]]s, wine and music. Detail from [[Chakhil-i-Ghoundi Stupa]], [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], [[Gandhara]], 1st century AD.]]
The Kushan King Kanishka, who honored Zoroastrian, Greek and Brahmanic deities as well as the Buddha and was famous for his religious syncretism, convened the [[Fourth Buddhist council]] around 100 in [[Kashmir]] in order to redact the [[Sarvastivada#Canon|Sarvastivadin canon]]. Some of Kanishka's coins bear the earliest representations of the Buddha on a coin (around 120), in Hellenistic style and with the word "Boddo" in Greek script.

Kanishka also had the original Gandhari Prakrit [[Mahāyāna sūtras]] translated into [[Sanskrit]], "a turning point in the evolution of the Buddhist literary canon"&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kanishka casket]], dated to the first year of Kanishka's reign in 127, was signed by a Greek artist named ''Agesilas'', who oversaw work at Kanishka's stupas ([[cetiya]]), confirming the direct involvement of Greeks with Buddhist realizations at such a late date.

==Philosophical influences==
Several philosophers, including [[Pyrrho]], [[Anaxarchus]] and [[Onesicritus]], are said to have accompanied Alexander in his eastern campaigns. During the 18 months they were in India, they were able to interact with Indian ascetics, generally described as [[Gymnosophists]] ("naked philosophers").

Pyrrho returned to Greece and founded [[Pyrrhonism]], the first Western school of [[skepticism]]. The Greek biographer [[Diogenes Laërtius]] explained that Pyrrho's equanimity and detachment from the world were acquired in India.&lt;ref&gt;"He would withdraw from the world and live in solitude, rarely showing himself to his relatives; this is because he had heard an Indian reproach [[Anaxarchus]], telling him that he would never be able to teach others what is good while he himself danced attendance on kings in their court. He would maintain the same composure at all times." (Diogenes Laertius, IX.63 on Pyrrhon)&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrrho was directly influenced by Buddhism in developing his philosophy, which is based on Pyrrho's interpretation of the Buddhist [[Three marks of existence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Christopher I. |title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2015 |page=28 |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10500.pdf |ISBN=9781400866328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of these philosophers, Onesicritus, a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]], is said by [[Strabo]] to have learnt in India the following precepts: "That nothing that happens to a man is bad or good, opinions being merely dreams. ... That the best philosophy [is] that which liberates the mind from [both] pleasure and grief".&lt;ref name="Strabo XV.1"&gt;Strabo, XV.I.65: {{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;query=head%3D%23119 |title=Strabo XV.1 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene]], from the city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] where [[Magas of Cyrene]] ruled, is thought by some to have been influenced by the teachings of Ashoka's Buddhist missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;"The philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene (nicknamed ''Peisithanatos'', "The advocate of death") was a contemporary of Magas and was probably influenced by the teachings of the Buddhist missionaries to Cyrene and Alexandria. His influence was such that he was ultimately prohibited from teaching." Jean-Marie Lafont, [[Inalco]] in "Les Dossiers d'Archéologie", No254, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic influences==
{{Main|Greco-Buddhist art}}
Numerous works of [[Greco-Buddhist art]] display the intermixing of Greek and Buddhist influences in such creation centers as [[Gandhara]]. The subject matter of Gandharan art was definitely Buddhist, while most motifs were of [[Western Asia]]tic or Hellenistic origin.

===Anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha===
[[File:MaraAssault.jpg|thumb|upright|An aniconic representation of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]'s assault on the Buddha, 2nd century AD, [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district]], [[India]].]]
Although there is still some debate, the first [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] representations of the Buddha himself are often considered a result of the Greco-Buddhist interaction. Before this innovation, Buddhist art was "[[aniconism|aniconic]]": the Buddha was only represented through his symbols (an empty throne, the [[Bodhi Tree]], [[Buddha footprint]]s, the [[Dharmachakra]]).

This reluctance towards anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), seem to be connected to one of the Buddha's sayings reported in the ''[[Digha Nikaya]]'' that discouraged representations of himself after the extinction of his body.&lt;ref&gt;"Due to the statement of the Master in the ''Dighanikaya'' disfavouring his representation in human form after the extinction of body, reluctance prevailed for some time". Also "''Hinayanis'' opposed image worship of the Master due to canonical restrictions".   R.C. Sharma, in "The Art of Mathura, India", Tokyo National Museum 2002, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably not feeling bound by these restrictions, and because of "their cult of form, the Greeks were the first to attempt a sculptural representation of the Buddha".&lt;ref&gt;Linssen, "[[Zen]] Living"&lt;/ref&gt; {{page needed|date=June 2014}} In many parts of the Ancient World, the Greeks did develop [[syncretic]] divinities, that could become a common religious focus for populations with different traditions: a well-known example is [[Serapis]], introduced by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] in [[Egypt]], who combined aspects of Greek and Egyptian Gods. In India as well, it was only natural for the Greeks to create a single common divinity by combining the image of a Greek [[god-king]] ([[Apollo]], or possibly the deified founder of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]], [[Demetrius I of Bactria]]), with the traditional [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]].

}}
Many of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: [[himation]], the [[contrapposto]] stance of the upright figures, such as the 1st–2nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas, the stylized curly hair and [[ushnisha]] apparently derived from the style of the [[Apollo Belvedere]] (330&amp;nbsp;BC) and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. A large quantity of [[sculpture]]s combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and [[iconography]] were excavated at the modern site of [[Hadda, Afghanistan]]. The curly hair of Buddha is described in the famous list of the [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]] in the Buddhist sutras. The hair with curls turning to the right is first described in the [[Pāli canon]]; we find the same description in the ''[[Prajnaparamita|Dāsāṣṭasāhasrikā prajñāpāramitā]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Greek artists were most probably the authors of these early representations of the Buddha, in particular the standing statues, which display "a realistic treatment of the folds and on some even a hint of modelled volume that characterizes the best Greek work. This is Classical or Hellenistic Greek, not archaizing Greek transmitted by Persia or Bactria, nor distinctively [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]."&lt;ref&gt;Boardman{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek stylistic influence on the representation of the Buddha, through its idealistic realism, also permitted a very accessible, understandable and attractive visualization of the ultimate state of [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] described by Buddhism, allowing it to reach a wider audience:
{{quote|One of the distinguishing features of the Gandharan school of art that emerged in north-west India is that it has been clearly influenced by the naturalism of the Classical Greek style. Thus, while these images still convey the inner peace that results from putting the Buddha's doctrine into practice, they also give us an impression of people who walked and talked, etc. and slept much as we do. I feel this is very important. These figures are inspiring because they do not only depict the goal, but also the sense that people like us can achieve it if we try.|[[14th Dalai Lama]]&lt;ref&gt;[[14th Dalai Lama]], foreword to "Echoes of Alexander the Great", 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the following centuries, this anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha defined the canon of Buddhist art, but progressively evolved to incorporate more Indian and Asian elements.

===Hellenized Buddhist pantheon===

[[File:Coin of Kanishka I.jpg|thumb|left|A Buddhist coin of [[Kanishka I]], with legend ΒΟΔΔΟ "Boddo" (=the [[Buddha]]) in Greek script on the reverse.]]
Several other Buddhist deities may have been influenced by Greek gods. For example, [[Heracles]] with a lion-skin, the protector deity of [[Demetrius I of Bactria]], "served as an artistic model for [[Vajrapani]], a protector of the Buddha"&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; (See&lt;ref&gt;Images of the Herakles-influenced Vajrapani: [https://web.archive.org/web/20131216205740/http://www.exoticindiaart.com/artimages/BuddhaImage/greece_sm.jpg Image 1], [http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/gaddis/HST210/Oct21/Heracles-Vajrapani.jpg Image 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040313155937/http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/gaddis/HST210/Oct21/Heracles-Vajrapani.jpg |date=2004-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). In [[Japan]], this expression further translated into the wrath-filled and muscular [[Nio|Niō]] guardian gods of the Buddha, standing today at the entrance of many Buddhist temples.

According to Katsumi Tanabe, professor at Chūō University, Japan, besides Vajrapani, Greek influence also appears in several other gods of the Mahayana pantheon such as the Japanese [[Fūjin]], inspired from the Greek divinity [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]] through the Greco-Buddhist [[Wardo]], or the mother deity [[Hariti]] inspired by [[Tyche]].&lt;ref&gt;Katsumi Tanabe, ''Alexander the Great: East-West Cultural Contact from Greece to Japan'' (Tokyo: NHK Puromōshon and Tokyo National Museum, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, forms such as [[garland]]-bearing [[cherub]]s, [[vine]] [[scroll]]s, and such semi-human creatures as the [[centaur]] and [[Triton (mythology)|triton]], are part of the repertory of Hellenistic art introduced by Greco-Roman artists in the service of the Kushan court.

===Gandharan proselytism in the East===

[[File:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|Blue-eyed [[Buddhism in Central Asia|Central Asia]]n monk teaching East-Asian monk. A fresco from the  [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves]], dated to the 9th or 10th century ([[Kara-Khoja Kingdom]]).]]

Greek monks played a direct role in the upper hierarchy of Buddhism, and in its early dissemination. During the rule (165–135&amp;nbsp;BC) of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] King [[Menander I]] ([[Pāli|Pali]]: "Milinda"),  [[Mahadharmaraksita]] (literally translated as 'Great Teacher/Preserver of the Dharma') was "a Greek ([[Pāli|Pali]]: [[Yona]], lit. [[Ionia]]n) Buddhist head monk," according to the [[Mahavamsa]] (Chap. XXIX), who led 30,000 Buddhist monks from "the Greek city of Alasandra" ([[Alexandria of the Caucasus]], around 150&amp;nbsp;km north of today's [[Kabul]] in [[Afghanistan]]), to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the [[Ruwanwelisaya|Great Stupa]] in [[Anuradhapura]]. [[Dharmaraksita]] ([[Sanskrit]]), or Dhammarakkhita ([[Pāli|Pali]]) ([[translation]]: ''Protected by the [[Dharma]]''), was one of the [[missionary|missionaries]] sent by the [[Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka]] to proselytize the [[Buddhist]] faith. He is described as being a Greek ([[Pāli|Pali]]: "[[Yona]]", lit. "[[Ionia]]n") in the [[Mahavamsa]], and his activities are indicative of the strength of the Hellenistic [[Hellenistic Greece|Greek]] involvement during the formative centuries of Buddhism. Indeed, [[Menander I]] was famously converted to Buddhism by [[Nagasena]], who was a student of the Greek Buddhist monk [[Dharmaraksita]]. Menander is said to have reached enlightenment as an [[arhat]] under Nagasena's guidance and is recorded as a great patron of Buddhism. The dialogue of the Greek King Menander I ([[Pāli|Pali]] "Milinda") with the monk [[Nagasena]] comprises the Pali Buddhist work known as the [[Milinda Panha]].

Buddhist monks from the region of [[Gandhara]] in Afghanistan, where Greco-Buddhism was most influential, later played a key role in the development and the transmission of Buddhist ideas in the direction of northern Asia. Greco-Buddhist [[Kushan]] monks such as [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]] ({{circa|AD&amp;nbsp;178}}) travelled to the Chinese capital of [[Loyang]], where they became the first translators of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz|Foltz, Richard]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition, 2010, p. 46 {{ISBN|978-0-230-62125-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Asian and East Asian Buddhist monks appear to have maintained strong exchanges until around the 10th century, as indicated by the [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves]] frescos from the [[Tarim Basin]]. In legend too [[Bodhidharma]], the founder of [[Chán]]-Buddhism, which later became [[Zen]], and the legendary originator of the physical training of the [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] monks that led to the creation of [[Shaolin Kung Fu]], is described as a Buddhist monk from [[Buddhism in Central Asia|Central Asia]] in the first Chinese references to him (Yan Xuan-Zhi in 547).&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, Jeffrey L. (1999), The Bodhidharma Anthology: The Earliest Records of Zen, Berkeley: University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-21972-4}}. pp. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout [[Buddhist art]], Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian, and he is referred as "The Blue-Eyed [[Barbarian]]" ({{zh|c=碧眼胡|p=Bìyǎn hú|labels=no}}) in Chinese Chan texts.&lt;ref&gt;Soothill, William Edward; Hodous, Lewis (1995), A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms, London: RoutledgeCurzon https://web.archive.org/web/20140303182232/http://buddhistinformatics.ddbc.edu.tw/glossaries/files/soothill-hodous.ddbc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 485 AD, according to the 7th century Chinese historic treatise [[Liang Shu]], five monks from Gandhara travelled to the country of [[Fusang]] ("The country of the extreme East" beyond the sea, probably eastern [[Japan]]), where they introduced Buddhism:

{{quote|"[[Fusang]] is located to the east of China, 20,000 ''[[Li (Chinese unit)|li]]'' [1,500&amp;nbsp;km] east of the state of ''Da Han'' (itself east of the state of ''Wa'' in modern [[Kyūshū]], [[Japan]]). (...) In former times, the people of Fusang knew nothing of the Buddhist religion, but in the second year of Da Ming of the [[Song dynasty]] [AD&amp;nbsp;485], five monks from Kipin ([[Kabul]] region of Gandhara) travelled by ship to Fusang. They propagated Buddhist doctrine, circulated scriptures and drawings, and advised the people to relinquish worldly attachments. As a result the customs of Fusang changed." (Chinese: "{{lang|zh|扶桑在大漢國東二萬餘里,地在中國之東(...)其俗舊無佛法,宋大明二年,罽賓國嘗有比丘五人游行至其國,流通佛法,經像,教令出家,風 俗遂改.}}")}}

Two half-brothers from [[Gandhara]], [[Asanga]] and [[Vasubandhu]] (4th century), created the [[Yogacara]] or "Mind-only" school of Mahayana Buddhism, which through one of its major texts, the [[Lankavatara Sutra]], became a founding block of Mahayana, and particularly Zen, philosophy.

===Greco-Buddhism in the West===
[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) 3rd century BC by Indian Buddhist King Ashoka. This edict advocates the adoption of "godliness" using the Greek term [[Eusebeia]] for [[Dharma]]. [[Kabul]] Museum.]]
Intense westward physical exchange at that time along the [[Silk Road]] is confirmed by the Roman craze for [[silk]] from the 1st century BC to the point that the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] issued, in vain, several edicts to prohibit the wearing of silk, on economic and moral grounds. This is attested by at least three authors: [[Strabo]] (64/63&amp;nbsp;BC – {{circa|AD&amp;nbsp;24}}), [[Seneca the Younger]] ({{circa|3&amp;nbsp;BC}} – AD&amp;nbsp;65), and [[Pliny the Elder]] (AD&amp;nbsp;23–79). The aforementioned Strabo and [[Plutarch]] ({{circa|45}}–125) also wrote about Indo-Greek Buddhist king [[Milinda|Menander]], confirming that information about the Indo-Greek Buddhists was circulating throughout the Hellenistic world.

[[Zarmanochegas]] (Zarmarus) (Ζαρμανοχηγὰς) was a monk of the [[Sramana]] tradition (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as [[Strabo]] and [[Dio Cassius]], met [[Nicholas of Damascus]] in [[Antioch]] while Augustus (died AD&amp;nbsp;14) was ruling the Roman Empire, and shortly thereafter proceeded to Athens where he burnt himself to death.&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="liv, 9"/&gt; His story and tomb in Athens were well-known over a century later. [[Plutarch]] (died AD&amp;nbsp;120) in his Life of Alexander, after discussing the self-immolation of [[Calanus of India]] ([[Kalanos]]) witnessed by Alexander writes: "The same thing was done long after by another Indian who came with Caesar to Athens, where they still show you 'the Indian's Monument,'"&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. 'Life of Alexander' in The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans. (trans John Dryden and revised Arthur Hugh Clough) The Modern Library (Random House Inc). New York.p850&lt;/ref&gt; referring to Zarmanochegas' tomb in Roman Athens.

Another century later the Christian church father [[Clement of Alexandria]] (died 215) mentioned Buddha by name in his Stromata (Bk I, Ch XV): "The Indian [[gymnosophists]] are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. And of these there are two classes, some of them called Sarmanæ and others Brahmins. And those of the Sarmanæ who are called "Hylobii" neither inhabit cities, nor have roofs over them, but are clothed in the bark of trees, feed on nuts, and drink water in their hands. Like those called Encratites in the present day, they know not marriage nor begetting of children. Some, too, of the Indians obey the precepts of [[Buddha]] (Βούττα) whom, on account of his extraordinary sanctity, they have raised to divine honours."&lt;ref name="ccel.org"&gt;Clement of Alexandria Stromata. BkI, Ch XV http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.vi.iv.i.xv.html (Accessed 19 Dec 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist gravestones from the [[Ptolemaic period]] have also been found in Alexandria in Egypt, decorated with depictions of the Dharma wheel.&lt;ref&gt;Tarn, ''The Greeks in Bactria and India''&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of Buddhists in Alexandria at this time is important, since "It was later in this very place that some of the most active centers of Christianity were established".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Linssen]], ''Zen living''&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-Christian monastic order of the [[Therapeutae]] is possibly a deformation of the Pāli word "[[Theravada|Theravāda]],"&lt;ref&gt;According to the linguist Zacharias P. Thundy&lt;/ref&gt; a form of Buddhism, and the movement may have "almost entirely drawn (its) inspiration from the teaching and practices of Buddhist asceticism".&lt;ref&gt;"Zen living", [[Robert Linssen]]{{Page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may even have been descendants of [[Asoka]]'s emissaries to the West.&lt;ref&gt;"The Original Jesus" (Element Books, Shaftesbury, 1995), Elmar R Gruber, Holger Kersten&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism and Christianity===
{{Main|Buddhism and Christianity|Buddhist influences on Christianity}}
[[File:MayaDream.jpg|thumb|Queen Māyā's white elephant dream, and the conception of the Buddha. [[Gandhara]], 2nd–3rd century AD.]]

Although the philosophical systems of Buddhism and Christianity have evolved in rather different ways, the moral precepts advocated by Buddhism from the time of Ashoka through his edicts do have some similarities with the Christian moral precepts developed more than two centuries later: respect for life, respect for the weak, rejection of violence, pardon to sinners, tolerance.

One theory is that these similarities may indicate the propagation of Buddhist ideals into the Western World, with the Greeks acting as intermediaries and religious syncretists.&lt;ref&gt;"Certain Indian notions may have made their way westward into the budding Christianity of the Mediterranean world through the channels of the Greek diaspora."  Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"Scholars have often considered the possibility that Buddhism influenced the early development of Christianity. They have drawn attention to many parallels concerning the births, lives, doctrines, and deaths of the Buddha and Jesus" (Bentley, ''Old World Encounters'').}}

The story of the birth of the Buddha was well known in the West, and possibly influenced the story of the birth of Jesus: [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]] (4th century AD) mentions the birth of the Buddha, who he says "was born from the side of a virgin,"&lt;ref name="McEvilley, p391"&gt;McEvilley, p391&lt;/ref&gt; and the influential early Christian church father [[Clement of Alexandria]] (died AD 215) mentioned Buddha (Βούττα) in his Stromata (Bk I, Ch XV).&lt;ref name="ccel.org"/&gt; The legend of Christian saints [[Barlaam and Josaphat]] draws on the life of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;John Walbridge ''The Wisdom of the Mystic East: Suhrawardī and Platonic Orientalism'' Page 129  – 2001 "The form Būdhīsaf is the original, as shown by Sogdian form Pwtysfi and the early New Persian form Bwdysf. ... On the Christian versions see A. S. Geden, Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, s.v. "Josaphat, Barlaam and," and M. P. Alfaric, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

ICRANet headquarters are located in [[Pescara]], Italy.

== History of ICRANet foundation: ICRA and ICRANet ==

=== ICRA and ICRANet ===

In 1985, the International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICRA|url=http://www.icra.it/|website=ICRA|accessdate=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223074040/http://www.icra.it/|archive-date=2008-02-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics|ICRA]] was founded by [[Remo Ruffini]] ([[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome "La Sapienza"]]) together with [[Riccardo Giacconi]] ([[Nobel Prize]] for Physics 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2002|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2002/summary/|publisher=[[Nobel Committee]]|accessdate=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008225757/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2002/summary/|archive-date=2018-10-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Abdus Salam]] (Nobel Prize for Physics 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/summary/|publisher=[[Nobel Committee]]|accessdate=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914132820/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/summary|archive-date=2018-09-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Paul Boynton ([[University of Washington]]), [[George Coyne]] (former director of the [[Vatican Observatory|Vatican observatory]]), [[Francis Everitt]] ([[Stanford University]]) and [[Fang Lizhi|Fang Li-Zhi]] ([[University of Science and Technology of China]]).

The Statute and the Agreement establishing of ICRANet were signed on March 19, 2003, and they were recognized in the same year by the [[Armenia|Republic of Armenia]] and the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]]. ICRANet has been created in 2005 by a law of the Italian Government, ratified by the Italian Parliament and signed by the President of the Italian Republic [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] on February 10, 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEGGE 10 febbraio 2005, n. 31|url=http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/vediMenuHTML?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2005-03-05&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=005G0050&amp;tipoSerie=serie_generale&amp;tipoVigenza=originario|publisher=Gazzetta Ufficiale dell Repubblica Italiana|access-date=2015-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126185845/http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/vediMenuHTML?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2005-03-05&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=005G0050&amp;tipoSerie=serie_generale&amp;tipoVigenza=originario|archive-date=2015-11-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Republic of Armenia, [[Italy|Italian Republic]], the Vatican City State, ICRA, the [[University of Arizona]] and the [[Stanford University]] are the founding members.

On September 12, 2005, ICRANet Steering Committee was established and had its first meeting: Remo Ruffini and Fang Li-Zhi were appointed respectively Director and Chairman of the Steering Committee. On December 19, 2006 ICRANet Scientific Committee was established and had its first meeting in Washington DC. Riccardo Giacconi was appointed Chairman and John Mester Co-Chairman.

On September 21, 2005 the Director of ICRANet signed, together with the then Ambassador of Brazil in Rome Dante Coelho De Lima the adhesion of the [[Brazil|Federative Republic of Brazil]] to ICRANet. The entrance of Brazil, requested by the then President of Brazil [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Luiz Ignácio Lula Da Silva]] has been unanimously ratified by the Brazilian Parliament. On August 12, 2011, the then President of Brazil [[Dilma Rousseff]] signed the entrance of Brazil in ICRANet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DECRETO Nº 7.552, DE 12 DE AGOSTO DE 2011.|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2011-2014/2011/Decreto/D7552.htm|website=Presidência da República|publisher=Presidência da República|access-date=2015-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126173536/http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2011-2014/2011/Decreto/D7552.htm|archive-date=2015-11-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marcel Grossmann meetings ===

By the beginning of the twentieth century the new branch of mathematics, tensor calculus, was developed in the works of [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro|Gregorio Ricci Curbastro]] and [[Tullio Levi-Civita|Tullio Levi Civita]] of the [[University of Padua]] and the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome "La Sapienza"]]. [[Marcel Grossmann]] of the [[University of Zurich]] who had a deep knowledge of the Italian school of geometry and who was close to Einstein introduced to him these concepts. The collaboration between Einstein and Grossmann was [[History of general relativity|essential]] for the development of General Relativity.

Remo Ruffini and Abdus Salam in 1975 established the Marcel Grossmann meetings (MG) on Recent Developments in Theoretical and Experimental General Relativity, Gravitation, and Relativistic Field Theories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcel Grossmann Meetings|url=http://www.icranet.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=258|website=icranet.org|publisher=ICRANet|accessdate=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126165119/http://www.icranet.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=258|archive-date=2015-11-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which take place every three years in different countries, gathering more then 1000 researchers. MG1 and MG2 were held in 1975 and in 1979 in [[Trieste]]; MG3 in 1982 in [[Shanghai]]; MG4 in 1985 in Rome; MG5 in 1988 in [[Perth]]; MG6 in 1991 in [[Kyoto]]; MG7 in 1994 at [[Stanford, California|Stanford]]; MG8 in 1997 in [[Jerusalem]]; MG9 in 2000 in Rome; MG10 in 2003 in [[Rio de Janeiro]]; MG11 in 2006 in [[Berlin]]; MG12 in 2009 in [[Paris]]; MG13 in 2012 in [[Stockholm]]; MG14 in 2015 and MG15 in 2018 both in Rome. Since its foundation, ICRANet has always played a leading role in the organization of those meetings.

=== Brazilian Science Data Center ===
The main objective of the Brazilian Science Data Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BSDC|url=http://bsdc.icranet.org/|publisher=ICRANet|accessdate=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208073146/http://bsdc.icranet.org/|archive-date=2015-12-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (BSDC) is to provide data of all international space missions existing on the wavelength of X- and gamma rays, and later on the whole electromagnetic spectrum, for all the galactic and extragalactic sources of the Universe. A special attention will be paid to the achievement and the complete respect of the levels defined by the [[International Virtual Observatory Alliance]] (IVOA). In addition to these specific objectives, BSDC will promote technical seminars, annual workshops and it will assure a plan of scientific divulgation and popularization of science with the aim of the understanding of the Universe.

The BSDC is currently being implemented at CBPF, and at the [[Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul]] (UFRGS), and will be expanded to all other ICRANet centers in Brazil as well as to the other Latin-American ICRANet Centers in [[Argentina]], [[Colombia]] and [[Mexico]]: a unique coordinated continental research network planned for Latin America.

'''iSBEM''' is a free-cost proprietary [[Graphical user interface|software interface]] to the Simplified Building Energy Model (SBEM) which is designed for the purpose of indicating compliance with [[United Kingdom|UK]] building regulations part L2a and L2b in [[England]] and section 6 in [[Scotland]] as regards [[carbon emission]]s from non domestic buildings. The latest version at time of writing is V 5.4.b &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncm.bre.co.uk/newsdetails.jsp?id=50&lt;/ref&gt; which is available as a download from the EPBD NCM website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncm.bre.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

It has recently undergone additional programming to allow it to be used to produce EPCs for Non-Domestic Buildings.
{{See also|Building regulations in the United Kingdom}}

Several commercial software tools exist, offering a more 'user-friendly' front-end to the SBEM calculation engine than iSBEM.
 
The SBEM calculation engine has some limitations and is explicitly distributed 'Not a Design Tool'. For more complex buildings, accredited Dynamic Simulation Modelling tools should be used for Part L compliance and EPCs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5363">Policy '''Impact Assessments''' (IAs) are formal, evidence-based procedures that assess the economic, social, and environmental effects of [[public policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adelle|first=Camilla|author2=Weiland, Sabine |title=Policy assessment: the state of the art|journal=Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal|date=2012|volume=30|issue=1|pages=25–33|doi=10.1080/14615517.2012.663256}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been incorporated into policy making in the [[OECD]] countries and the [[European Commission]].

Key types of impact assessments include global assessments (global level), policy impact assessment (policy level), strategic environmental assessment (programme and plan level), and [[environmental impact assessment]] (project level). Impact assessments can focus on specific themes, such as [[social impact assessment]]s and gender impact assessments.

IAs can improve legislation by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Klaus|author2=Ferretti, Johanna |author3=Guske, Anna-Lena |author4=Turnpenny, John |author5=Jordan, Andrew |author6= Adelle, Camilla |title=Sustainability in Impact Assessments A Review of Impact Assessment Systems in selected OECD countries and the European Commission|journal=OECD|date=2011|volume=SG/SD(2011)6/FINAL|url=http://www.oecd.org/gov/regulatory-policy/Sustainability%20in%20impact%20assessment%20SG-SD%282011%296-FINAL.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Informing policy makers about potential economic, social, and environmental ramifications
* Improving transparency so that contributions to sustainability and "better regulation" are disclosed and [[Special Interest Group|special interest]] [[lobbying]] is discouraged
* Increasing public participation in order to reflect a range of considerations, thereby improving the legitimacy of policies
* Clarifying how public policy helps achieve its goals and priorities through policy indicators
* Contributing to continuous learning in policy development by identifying causalities that inform ex-post review of policies

== Procedure ==
The department which is responsible for the policy proposal usually has to carry out the IA. Although the purpose and orientation of IA procedures differ, IA guidelines in the various jurisdictions all follow a similar set of steps to be followed by desk officers:
# Planning of the IA
# Carrying out the impact analysis
# Consultation of affected stakeholders and the general public
# Coordination with affected departments
# Summary and presentation of findings in a report
# Forwarding findings to decision makers
# Publication of the IA report (not in all countries)

The analytical steps, which mainly relate to step 2, can be set out as
i.	Problem definition
ii.	Definition of policy objectives
iii.	Development of policy options
iv.	Analysis of impacts
v.	Comparison of policy options and recommendation of one option
vi.	Defining monitoring measures.

== Methods ==
Throughout the IA process, methods can be used for support. In recent years governments have increasingly invested in developing and applying methods and tools for IA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Podhora|first=Aranka |author2=Helming, K |author3=Adenäuer, L. |author4=Heckelei, T. |author5=Kautto, P. |author6=Reidsma, P. |author7=Rennings, K. |author8=Turnpenny, J. |author9=Jansen, J.|title=).

Depending on usage, IA methods can be classified as methods for
* Scoping (e.g., checklists)
* For qualitative analysis (e.g., [[focus groups]])
* For quantitative analysis (e.g., [[life-cycle assessment]], [[material flow accounting]], modelling)
* Aggregation and comparison of options (e.g., [[cost–benefit analysis]])
* Analysing coherence (e.g., Gender IA)
* Supporting participation and involvement (e.g., internet consultation)
* Data presentation and involvement (e.g., [[GIS]])
* [[Monitoring and evaluation]] (e.g., indicators)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LIAISE – Network of Excellence|title=LIAISE KIT – Knowledge for Decision Making|url=http://www.liaise-kit.eu/|accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[BBC News|BBC]], Manzoni explained how employees also contribute to their own unsatisfactory relationships with their superiors. Manzoni cautioned that attaching labels like demanding or overbearing can ultimately become a self-fulfilling prophecy. "The moment you label someone as difficult you’ve just made them more difficult to work with because you’re not going to give this person the benefit of the doubt anymore and you’re not going to relate with them on a productive level."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170817-how-to-identify-and-handle-a-demanding-boss|title=How to identify, and handle, a demanding boss|last=Johanson|first=Mark|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28531">'''Jewish commentaries on the Bible''' are [[List of biblical commentaries|biblical commentaries]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (the [[Tanakh]]) from a Jewish perspective. Translations into [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and English, and some universally accepted Jewish commentaries with notes on their method of approach and modern translations into English with notes are listed.

== Earliest printing ==
The complete Tanakh in Hebrew, with commentaries by [[Rashi]], [[Radak]], [[Nahmanides|Ramban]], and [[Ralbag]] was printed in 1517 by [[Daniel Bomberg]] and edited by [[Felix Pratensis]] under the name [[Mikraot Gedolot]].

The Tanakh was handed down in manuscript form along with a method of checking the accuracy of the transcription known as [[Masoretic Text|mesorah]]. Many codices containing the [[Masoretic Text]] were gathered by [[Jacob ben Hayyim ibn Adonijah]] and were used to publish an accurate text. It was published by [[Daniel Bomberg]] in 1525. Later editions were edited with the help of [[Elia Levita]]. Various editions of Mikraot Gedolot are still in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/TalmudMap/MG.html |title=Mikra'ot Gedolot |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translations ==

=== Targum ===
A [[Targum]] is a translation of the Bible into [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. The classic Targumim are [[Targum Onkelos]] on the [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (a [[Torah]] in printed form), [[Targum Jonathan]] on [[Nevi'im]] (the Prophets), and a fragmentary [[Targum Yerushalmi]]. There is no standard Aramaic translation of the [[Ketuvim]].&lt;ref&gt;Megilla 3a&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Targim Onkelos ====
[[Targum Onkelos]] is the most often consulted literal translation of the Bible&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica:Bible:Targum Onkelos:third paragrph&lt;/ref&gt; with a few exceptions. Figurative language is usually not translated literally but is explained (e.g., Gen. 49:25; Ex. 15:3, 8, 10; 29:35). Geographical names are often replaced by those current at a later time (e.g., Gen. 10:10; Deut. 3:17).

According to the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;Bavli, Megilla, 3a as understood by the Marshah, Chidushai Agadot on Nedorim, 9b. See also the Yam Shel Shlomo on Yebomot chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; the Torah and its translation into Aramaic were given to Moses on Mount Sinai, because Egyptian slaves spoke Aramaic. After the [[Babylonian exile]], the Targum was completely forgotten. [[Onkelos]], a Roman convert to Judaism, was able to reconstruct the original Aramaic. [[Saadia Gaon]] disagrees and says the Aramaic of Onkelos was never a spoken language. He believed that Onkelos's Aramaic was an artificial construct, a combination of Eastern and Western dialects of Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica: Bible&lt;/ref&gt; The mayor commentary on Targum Onkelos is "Netinah LaGer" written by [[Nathan Marcus Adler]].

==== Targum Jonathan ====
According to scholars, Targum Jonathan found in the [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] was not written by [[Jonathan ben Uzziel]], who refer to it instead as [[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]]. According to the ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', 2nd ed., vol. 3, p. 591&lt;/ref&gt; internal evidence shows that it was written sometime between the 7th and 14th centuries CE. For example, [[Ishmael]]'s wife's name is translated into Aramaic as [[Fatima (name)|Fatima]] (who was Mohammed's daughter) and therefore Targum Pseudo-Jonathan must have been written after [[Mohammed]]'s birth. The classic Hebrew commentators would turn this argument around, and say that Mohammed's daughter was named after Ismael's wife. Both sides will agree, however that stylistically Jonathan's commentary on the Chumash is very different from the commentary on [[Neviim]]. The Targum Jonathan on Neviim is written in a very terse style, similar to Onkelos on Chumash, but on the average Targum Jonathan on Chumash is almost twice as wordy.

==== Targum Yerushalmi ====
The Jerusalem Targum exists only in fragmentary form. It translates a total of approximately 850 verses, phrases, and words. No one knows who wrote it. Some speculate that it was a printers error. The printer saw a manuscript headed with "TY" and assumed it was a Targum Yerushalmi when actually it was an early version of Targum Yonathan. Others speculate that it was written by a R. Yosef or R. Hoshea (Yihoshua).&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein's ''Otzer Yisrael'', v. 10 p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Rashi]] 1040–1106
::Rashi (Shlomo Yitzchaki) is the most influential Jewish exegete of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |author=Deborah Abecassis |title=Reconstructing Rashi's Commentary on Genesis from Citations in the Torah Commentaries of the Tosafot| pages=Page i | publisher=McGill University| date=March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the preeminent expounder of [[Peshat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title=Rashi| encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Judaica 2nd ed.| volume=vol. 17| pages=103| publisher=Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA| year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashi says "I, however, am only concerned with the plain sense of Scripture and with such [[Aggadah|Aggadot]] that explain the words of Scripture in a manner that fits in with them".&lt;ref&gt;Rashi's commentary on Genesis 3,8&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been many super-commentaries  written on Rashi's basic commentary,&lt;ref name=StoneChumash&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chumash|year=2000|publisher=Mesorah Publications Ltd.|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=0-89906-014-5|edition=Stone|editor=Nosson Scherman}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:
::* ''[[Be'er Mayim Chaim]]'', by [[Chaim ben Betzalel]] (1515–1588), the older brother of [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]].
::* ''[[Amar Nekeh]]'', by [[Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura]] (c. 1440–1516), a leading rabbi of Italy and Jerusalem, best known for his commentary on the [[Mishnah]].
::* ''[[Divrei David]]'', by [[David HaLevi Segal]] (1586–1667), a [[history of the Jews in Poland|Polish]] rabbinical authority known as the ''Taz'' for his classic commentary on the [[Shulchan Aruch]].
::* ''[[Gur Aryeh al haTorah]]'', by the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] (1526–1609), known for this work and for his fundamental works on Jewish philosophy and [[Jewish mysticism|mysticism]]
::* ''[[Maskil le-David]]'', by [[David Pardo (Italian rabbi)|David Pardo]] (1710–1792).
::* ''[[Sefer ha-Mizrachi]]'', by [[Elijah Mizrachi]] (1450–1525), which has itself spawned multiple supercommentaries such as ''Yeri'ot Shlomo'' by [[Solomon Luria]] and ''Leshon Arummim'' by [[Barzillai ben Baruch Jabez]].
::* [[Nachalas Yitzchak]]
::* ''[[Sefer Ha-zikaron]]'', by [[Abraham Lévy-Bacrat]], who lived through the [[Alhambra Decree|Spanish Expulsion]] of 1492.
::* ''[[Siftei Chachamim]]'', by [[Shabbethai Bass]], which analyzes other supercommentaries on Rashi and is considered important enough that a shortened version, ''Ikkar Sifsei Chachamim,'' is often printed with the commentary of Rashi.
* [[Rashbam]] 1085–1158
:: Rashbam (Samuel ben Meir) was the grandson of [[Rashi]] and the brother of [[Rabbeinu Tam]].
* [[Tobiah ben Eliezer]] 11th century [[Greece]]
:: Tobiah ben Eliezer was a [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniote]] scholar and ''[[paytan]]'', who wrote the ''Leḳaḥ Ṭov'' or ''Pesiḳta Zuṭarta'', a [[midrash]]ic commentary on the [[Pentateuch]] and the Five [[Megillot]]. The Talmudic passages which he cites in connection with the halakot he often interprets according to his own judgment and differently from Rashi. Like many other Biblical commentators, he translates certain words into the language of the country in which he is living, namely, [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;*Kaufmann, ''Eine unbekannte messianische Bewegung unter den Juden, in Jahrbuch für Jüdische Geschichte und Literatur'', i. 148 et seq., Berlin, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] 1092–1167
:: Ibn Ezra was a contemporary of the Rashbam. His commentary on [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] was reprinted under the name Sefer HaYashar. He clearly separates the literal meaning of a biblical verse from the traditional meaning, upon which the halacha is based, and from the homiletic meaning ''drush''. He explains that the traditional meaning and the homiletic meaning do not attempt to imply meaning to the verse; they only uses the verse as a mnemonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia=The Online Jewish Encyclopedia| title=Ibn Ezra, Abraham| date=1901–1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David Kimhi]] 1160–1235
:: David Kimchi followed the methodology of Ibn Ezra. He deemphasised homiletics and emphasised the Talmudic interpretations when they reached his standard of [[peshat]]. In his exegesis he strove for clarity and readability, as opposed to his predecessors who emphasised conciseness.&lt;ref&gt;Talmage, Frank. "Kimhi, David." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. Eds. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. Vol. 12. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt; His commentaries are said to have "a remarkably modern flavor"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ou.org/judaism-101/bios/leaders-in-the-diaspora/radak-rabbi-david-kimchi/&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Chumash, only Radak on Breishit survives.
* [[Nachmanides]] 1194–1270
:: Nachmanides (Ramban or Moses ben Nahman) was the first biblical commentator to introduce [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] concepts into his exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' 2nd ed. vol 14 page 741&lt;/ref&gt; He differed from the [[Zohar]] in that he believed that the transcendent nature of God is absolutely unknowable by man, whereas the school of Zoharists believed that transcendence is comprehensible through revelation, ecstasy, and in the contemplation of history.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' 2nd ed. vol 14 page 745&lt;/ref&gt; Ramban expressed his views through the [[pardes (Jewish exegesis)#Sod|Sod]] aspect of his commentary. He also expressed, in his commentary, his belief that all [[mitzvot]] had a comprehensible and rational explanation.
* [[Jacob ben Asher]] 1270–1340
:: The author of the [[Arba'ah Turim]], a precursor of the [[Shulchan Aruch]] Jacob ben Asher wrote a commentary on the Torah in which he anthologised the ''[[Pshat]]'' element of his predecessors. At the beginning of each section he wrote, as brain teasers, some explanations using ''[[kabbalah#Overview|Remez]]''. These were gathered and printed under the name ''Baal HaTurim''. The Baal HaTurim is printed in all modern editions of ''Mikraot Gedolot''. The full commentary titled ''Perush ha-Tur ha-Arokh al ha-Torah'', was published in Jerusalem in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' 2nd ed. vol. 11 page 31&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gersonides]] 1288–1344
:: Gersonides (The Ralbag or Levi ben Gershon) based his exegesis on three principles:
# What can be learned through the nine principles (he believed that four of them were not allowed to be used in post-talmudic times).
# Every story in the Bible come to teach us ethical, religious, and philosophical ideas.
# Most of what we call Remez can be clearly understood by resorting to exact translation and grammatical analysis. He also condemned allegorical explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein's ''Ozer Yisrael'' vol. 6 page 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hezekiah ben Manoah]] 13th century France
:: The Hizkuni based his kabbalistic commentary primarily on Rashi, but also used up to 20 other sources, including [[Dunash ben Labrat]].
* [[Isaac Abarbanel]] 1437–1508
:: In his commentary on Tanach, before each section, he would list a series of questions exploring the conceptual problems in the section from both exegetical and theological perspectives. His commentary would attempt to answer these questions through Pshat and Medrash. He distinguished between Medrashim that were part of Mesorah and those that were mere opinion and could be safely disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawee|first=Eric|author2=[[Avraham Grossman|Grossman, Avraham]]|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|edition=2nd|volume=1|pages=276–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acharonim (1600–) ===
{{See also|Acharonim}}
* [[Me'am Lo'ez]] 1730-1777
* [[Metsudot]] 18th century
:: The [[Metsudot]] (the fortresses) are a commentary on Neviim and Ketuvim written by Rabbi David Altshuler. When he died, his son Yechiel completed it and divided it into two sections: [[Metsudat Zion]], a glossary of difficult words, and [[Metsudat David]], a restatement of difficult ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'' in the section on Altschul&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Malbim]] 1809–1879
:: The Malbim's (Meir Leibush ben Yehiel Michel Wisser) exegesis is based on several assumptions.
:# There are no extra words or synonyms in the Bible. Every word is meaningful.
:# ''Drush'' is as explicit as ''Pshat'' is, except that ''Drush'' has different rules of usage and syntax.
:# The basis of the whole of the [[Oral law]] is explicit in the Bible, either through ''Pshat'' or ''Drush''. The only exception is when the Oral Law states that the law is not found in the Bible and is designated as ''[[Halacha l'Moshe m'Sinai]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pfeffer|first=Jeremy L.|title=Malbim's ''Job''|publisher=KTAV|location=Jersey City NJ|pages=10–11|chapter=Translator's Introduction|isbn=0-88125-801-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] 1808–1888
:: Hirsch was a German rabbi during the reformation period. His commentary focuses on the grammar and structure of the language of the Tanakh to facilitate understand the laws being given.  His commentary includes the Five Books of Moses and other various parts of the Tanakh.
* [[Torah Temimah]] 1860–1941
:: [[Baruch Epstein]] (Baruch ben Yechiel Michael HaLevi) was a bank worker by profession who devoted all of his extra time to Jewish studies. To write the Torah Temimah, he gathered excerpts from the [[Talmud]] and other sources of the Oral Law and arranged them in the order of the verses of the [[Written Law]] to which they refer. He then wove the excerpts into a commentary on the Bible and annotated each excerpt with critical notes and insights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|publisher=Keter|edition=2nd|volume=6|page=468}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nechama Leibowitz]]  1905–1997
:: In the early 1940s professor Leibowitz began mailing study sheets on the weekly Torah reading to her students throughout the world. The study sheets included essays on the weekly portion, source notes, and questions. She encouraged her students to send their answers to her for correction. Soon she was sending out thousands of sheets and correcting hundreds of answer sheets weekly. These study sheets were collected and published in English and Hebrew in the mid 1960s and they are still in print. "Her specific collection of sources was based solely on each one's contribution to understanding ''[[peshat]]'' and to the revelation of the significance of that text."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', second edition, volume 12, page 621&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th and 21st century ===
* ''Cup of Salvation'', also known as ''Cup of Salvation: A Powerful Journey Through King David's Psalms of Praise'', is a book written by [[Pesach Wolicki]] and published by the [[Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation]] (CJCUC) in 2017. The book is a devotional biblical commentary on [[Psalms]] 113-118 otherwise known as the [[Hallel]].
* The [[Soncino Books of the Bible]] covers the whole Tanakh in fourteen volumes, published by the [[Soncino Press]]. The first volume to appear was Psalms in 1945, and the last was Chronicles in 1952. The editor was Rabbi Abraham Cohen. Each volume contains the Hebrew and English texts of the Hebrew Bible in parallel columns, with a running commentary below them.
* [[Judaica Press]] is an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] publishing house. They have published a set of 24 bilingual Hebrew-English volumes of ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' for Nevi'im and Ketuvim, published as Books of the Prophets and Writings. As in traditional Mikraot Gedolot, the Hebrew text includes the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Aramaic]] [[Targum]], and several classic rabbinic commentaries. The English translations, by [[Avroham Yoseif Rosenberg]] (also: Abraham Joseph Rosenberg),&lt;ref name=JPR-Rosenberg&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Avroham Yoseif|title=The Complete Jewish Bible, With Rashi Commentary|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp51235|work=The Complete Tanach With Rashi|publisher=Judaica Press|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; include a translation of the Biblical text, [[Rashi]]'s commentary, and a summary of rabbinic and modern commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judaicapress.com/product_info.php?ref=1330&amp;products_id=47 Judaica Press Prophets &amp; Writings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211071116/http://www.judaicapress.com/product_info.php?ref=1330&amp;products_id=47 |date=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available online as Javascript-dependent HTML document with Rashi's commentary at chabad.org – [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/63255/jewish/The-Bible-with-Rashi.htm The Complete Jewish Bible with Rashi Commentary (in Hebrew and English)].&lt;ref name=JPR-online&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Avroham Yoseif|title=The Complete Jewish Bible, With Rashi Commentary (in Hebrew and English)|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/63255/jewish/The-Bible-with-Rashi.htm|work=Classic Texts|publisher=Judaica Press &amp; Chabad.org|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Living Torah]]'', by [[Aryeh Kaplan]], his best-known work, is a widely used, scholarly (and user friendly) translation into English of the Torah. It is noteworthy for its detailed index, thorough cross-references, extensive footnotes with maps and diagrams, and research on [[Realia (translation)|realia]], [[flora]], [[fauna]], and [[geography]]. The footnotes also indicate differences in interpretation between the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible#Commentaries|classic commentators]]. It was one of the first translations structured around the ''[[Parashah#Parashot in the Torah|parshiyot]]'', the traditional division of the Torah text. ''The Living Torah'' was later supplemented by ''[[The Living Torah and Nach#The Living Nach|The Living Nach]]'' on [[Nevi'im]] (two volumes: "The Early Prophets" and "The Latter Prophets") and [[Ketuvim]] ("Sacred Writings" in one volume). These were prepared posthumously following Rabbi Kaplan's format by others including Yaakov Elman.
* [[Mesorah Publications, Ltd.]] is a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Orthodox Jewish]] publishing company based in Brooklyn, New York. Its general editors are Rabbis [[Nosson Scherman]] and [[Meir Zlotowitz]]. They publish the [[Artscroll]] prayerbooks and Bible commentaries. In 1993 they published ''The Chumash: The Stone Edition'', a Torah translation and commentary arranged for liturgical use. It is popularly known as ''The ArtScroll Chumash'', and has since became the best-selling English-Hebrew Torah translation and commentary in the U.S. and other English-speaking countries. They have issued a series of Tanakh commentaries on the rest of the Tanakh. Their translations have been criticized by a few Modern Orthodox scholars, e.g. B. Barry Levy, and by some non-Orthodox scholars, as mistranslating the Bible. The dispute comes about because the editors at Mesorah Publications consciously attempt to present a translation of the text based on rabbinic tradition and medieval biblical commentators such as Rashi, as opposed to a literal translation.
* [[Koren Publishers Jerusalem]] is a Jerusalem-based publishing company founded in 1961. It publishes various editions of The Koren Tanakh, originally created by master typographer and company founder [[Eliyahu Koren]]. The Koren Tanakh is the official Tanakh accepted by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel for synagogue [[Haftarah]] reading, and the Bible upon which Israel's President is sworn into office. Koren offers a Hebrew/English edition with translation by biblical and literary scholar, Harold Fisch, and is currently at work on a Hebrew/English edition with translation and commentary by Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]].
* [[Da'at Miqra]] is a series of Hebrew-language biblical commentaries, published by the Jerusalem-based Rav Kook Institute. Its editors included the late Prof. Yehuda Elitzur of Bar-Ilan University, Bible scholar [[Amos Hakham]], Sha’ul Yisra’eli, [[Mordechai Breuer]] and [[Yehuda Kiel]]. The commentary combines a traditional rabbinic outlook with the findings of modern research. The editors have sought to present an interpretation based primarily upon Peshat — the direct, literal reading of the text — as opposed to Drash. They do so by incorporating geographic references, archaeological findings and textual analysis.
* ''[[Da'as Sofrim on Tanach]]'' is a 20 volume work by [[Chaim Dov Rabinowitz]] encompassing the whole of the Tanakh.  Based on the Rishonim, he spent more than 60 years compiling this massive commentary which is used for study by many talmidei chachamim and educators throughout the world.
* ''[[Kol Menachem#The Gutnick Edition Chumash|The Gutnick Edition Chumash]]'', by Rabbi Chaim Miller, is a translation that incorporates Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]]'s – the Rebbe's - "novel interpretation" of [[Rashi]]'s commentary. This "Toras Menachem" commentary is culled from the Rebbe's lectures and notes on classical and [[Hassidic]] interpretations. It also includes mystical insights called "Sparks of ''Chassidus''", a summary of the ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'' found in each ''[[Parashah]]'' according to ''[[Sefer ha-Chinuch]]''. It is unique in its presentation of "Classic Questions" - the questions underlying more than one hundred Torah commentaries.
* A second [[Lubavitch]] Chumash, [[Kehot Publication Society]]'s ''Torah Chumash'' (the "[http://www.lachumash.org/ LA Chumash]") offers an Interpolated English translation and commentary - "woven" together – again based on Rashi, and the works of the Rebbe.  The Chumash also includes a fully vocalized Hebrew text of Rashi`s commentary. The Editor-in-Chief is Rabbi [[Moshe Wisnefsky]] with contributing editors: Rabbis Baruch Kaplan, Betzalel Lifshitz, Yosef Marcus and Dov Wagner. Additional Features include "Chasidic Insights" and "Inner Dimensions", Chronological charts, topic titles, illustrations, diagrams and maps. Each sidra is prefaced by an overview, a study of the name of each sidra and its relevance to the respective text.
* A modern Orthodox [[Yeshiva]] in New York, [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]], recently started a new Bible series, ''Yeshivat Chovevei Torah Tanakh Companion''. The first volume out is ''Yeshivat Chovevei Torah Tanakh Companion to The Book of Samuel: Bible Study in the Spirit of Open and Modern Orthodoxy'', edited by [[Nathaniel Helfgot]] and [[Shmuel Herzfeld]].
* ''JPS Tanakh Commentary''. The [[Jewish Publication Society]], known in the Jewish community as ''JPS'', has initiated a long-term, large-scale project to complete a modern Jewish commentary on the entire Hebrew Bible. Unlike the Judaica Press and Soncino commentaries, the JPS commentaries are producing a detailed line-by-line commentary of every passage, in every book of the Bible. The amount of the JPS commentaries are almost an order of magnitude larger than those found in the earlier Orthodox English works. They currently have produced volumes on all five books of the Torah, the Haftarot, and the books of Jonah, Esther, Ecclesiastes, Ruth, and Song of Songs. Although not a book of the Bible, JPS has also issued a commentary volume on the Haggadah. The next volumes planned are Lamentations, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, &amp; Psalms (5 volumes).
* A major Bible commentary now in use by [[Conservative Judaism]] is [[Etz Hayim Humash|Etz Hayim: Torah and Commentary]], Its production involved the collaboration of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]], the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, and the Jewish Publication Society. The Hebrew and English bible text is the New JPS version. It contains a number of commentaries, written in English, on the Torah which run alongside the Hebrew text and its English translation, and it also contains a number of essays on the Torah and Tanakh in the back of the book. It contains three types of commentary: (1) the p'shat, which discusses the literal meaning of the text; this has been adapted from the first five volumes of the ''JPS Bible Commentary''; (2) the d'rash, which draws on Talmudic, Medieval, Chassidic, and Modern Jewish sources to expound on the deeper meaning of the text; and (3) the halacha l'maaseh – which explains how the text relates to current Jewish law.
* [[Leonard S. Kravitz]] and [[Kerry Olitzky]] have authored a series of Tanakh commentaries. Their commentaries draw on classical Jewish works such as the [[Mishnah]], [[Talmud]], [[Targum]]s, the [[midrash]] literature, and also the classical Jewish bible commentators such as [[Gersonides]], [[Rashi]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]]. They take into account modern scholarship; while these books take note of some findings of [[Higher criticism|higher textual criticism]], these are not academic books using source criticism to deconstruct the Tanakh. Rather, their purpose is educational, and Jewishly inspirational, and as such do not follow the path of classical Reform scholars, or the more secular projects such as the Anchor Bible series. The books also add a layer of commentary by modern-day rabbis. These books are published by the [[Union for Reform Judaism]]. Commentaries in this series now include Jonah, Lamentations, Ruth, the Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, and Proverbs.
* ''The Jewish Study Bible'', from [[Oxford University Press]], edited by [[Adele Berlin]] and [[Marc Zvi Brettler]]. The English bible text is the New JPS version. A new English commentary has been written for the entire Hebrew Bible drawing on both traditional rabbinic sources, and the findings of modern-day higher textual criticism.
* There is much overlap between non-Orthodox Jewish Bible commentary, and the non-sectarian and inter-religious Bible commentary found in the [[Anchor Bible Series]]. Originally published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], and now by [[Yale University Press]], this series began in 1956. Having initiated a new era of cooperation among scholars in biblical research, over 1,000 scholars—representing Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, secular, and other traditions—have now contributed to the project.
* ''The Torah: A Women's Commentary'', Edited by [[Tamara Cohn Eskenazi]] and Andrea Weiss. [[Union for Reform Judaism|URJ]] Press (December 10, 2007).  This volume "gives dimension to the women's voices in our tradition. Under Editor Dr. Tamara Cohn Eskenazi's skillful leadership, this commentary provides insight and inspiration for all who study Torah: men and women, Jew and non-Jew. As Dr. Eskenazi has eloquently stated, 'we want to bring the women of the Torah from the shadow into the limelight, from their silences into speech, from the margins to which they have often been relegated to the center of the page – for their sake, for our sake and for our children's sake.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urjbooksandmusic.com/product.php?productid=1986|title=URJ Books And Music :: Sacred Texts :: Torah: A Women's Commentary, The|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Women's Torah Commentary: New Insights from Women Rabbis on the 54 Weekly Torah Portions'' Edited by Rabbi Elyse Goldstein, Jewish Lights Publishing (September 2008).  From the Jewish Lights website: "In this groundbreaking book, more than 50 women rabbis come together to offer us inspiring insights on the Torah, in a week-by-week format. Included are commentaries by the first women ever ordained in the Reform, Reconstructionist and Conservative movements, and by many other women across these denominations who serve in the rabbinate in a variety of ways." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishlights.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=JL&amp;Product_Code=978-1-58023-370-5 |title=The Women's Torah Commentary: New Insights from Women Rabbis on the 54 Weekly Torah Portions |publisher=Jewishlights.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3955">'''LGBT people in science''' are students, professionals, hobbyists, and anyone else who is [[LGBT]] and interested in [[science]].

There are traditions and expectations that LGBT people should not study or have careers in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Suri |first1=Manil |authorlink=Manil Suri |title=Why Is Science So Straight? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/05/opinion/manil-suri-why-is-science-so-straight.html |website=The New York Times |date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016 the [[American Physical Society]] published a list of ways in which LGBT scientists have a more difficult career experience than their non-LGBT counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=American Physical Society |title=LGBT Climate in Physics |date=March 2016 |publisher=American Physical Society |isbn=978-0-9848110-7-6 |url=https://www.aps.org/programs/lgbt/upload/LGBTClimateinPhysicsReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some activists have speculated on whether the visibility of more LGBT [[role model|role models]] in science would make it easier for other LGBT students to join the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=David |title='No sexuality please, we're scientists' |url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/opinion/no-sexuality-please-were-scientists/7197.article |website=Chemistry World |language=en |date=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report on a 2015 survey of United States undergraduate students found that gay students of science were more likely to change their major to a subject outside of science than non-LGBT students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=Bryce E. |title=Coming out in STEM: Factors affecting retention of sexual minority STEM students |journal=Science Advances |date=14 March 2018 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=eaao6373 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.aao6373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some academic commentators who study LGBT issues commented that LGBT students face social barriers to studying science which non-LGBT people do not experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Langin |first1=Katie |title=STEM is losing male LGBQ undergrads |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2018/03/stem-losing-male-lgbq-undergrads |website=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |language=en |date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various activist organizations used this study as supporting evidence that social changes could bring equal opportunity for LGBT people to study and have careers in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ruiz |first1=Rebecca |title=The culture of STEM may sideline aspiring queer scientists |url=https://mashable.com/2018/03/14/stem-lesbian-gay-bisexual-queer-students/#fOwNLkdtvGq5 |website=Mashable |language=en |date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LIVAC''' is an uncommon language [[text corpus|corpus]] dynamically maintained since 1995. Different from other existing corpora, LIVAC has adopted a rigorous and regular as well as "Windows" approach in processing and filtering massive media texts from representative communities in the Pan-Chinese region including [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Taipei]], [[Singapore]], [[Shanghai]], [[Beijing]], [[Guangzhou]], and [[Shenzhen]].&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, Benjamin; Lai, Tom; Chan, Samuel; and Wang, William S.-Y. (Eds). (1998). ''Quantitative and Computational Studies on the Chinese Language'' 《漢語計量與計算研究》. Language Information Sciences Research Centre, City University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The contents are thus deliberately repetitive in most cases, represented by textual samples drawn from editorials, local and international news, cross-[[Taiwan Strait|Formosan Straits]] news, as well as news on finance, sports and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, B. K., Kwong, O.Y. (Eds). (2015). ''Linguistic Corpus and Corpus Linguistics in the Chinese Context'' ''(Journal of Chinese Linguistics Monograph Series Number 25)'', Hong Kong: [[Chinese University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, 2.5 billion characters of news media texts have been filtered so far, of which 600 million characters have been processed and analyzed and have yielded an expanding Pan-Chinese dictionary of 2 million words from the Pan-Chinese printed media. Through rigorous analysis based on computational methodology, LIVAC has at the same time accumulated a large amount of accurate and meaningful statistical data on the Chinese language and their speech communities in the Pan-Chinese region, and the result shows considerable and important variations.&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, Benjamin. (2004). "Chinese Language Processing at the Dawn of the 21st Century", in C R Huang and W Lenders (eds) ''Language and Linguistics Monograph Series B: Frontiers in Linguistics I'', pp.189–207. Institute of Linguistics, [[Academia Sinica]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, B. K. (2017). Loanwords in Mandarin Through Other Chinese Dialects. In R. Sybesma, W. Behr, Y. Gu, Z. Handel, C.-T. Huang &amp; J. Myers (Eds.), ''The Encyclopaedia of Chinese Language and Linguistics'' (Vol. 2, pp. 641-647). Leiden; Boston: BRILL&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Windows" approach is the most representative feature of LIVAC and has enabled Pan-Chinese media texts to be quantitatively analyzed according to various attributes such as ''locations'', ''time'' and ''subject'' domains. Thus, various types of comparative studies and applications in information technology as well as development of often related innovative applications have been possible.&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, Benjamin, and Kwong, Olivia. (2015). LIVAC as a Monitoring Corpus for Tracking Trends beyond Linguistics. In Tsou, Benjamin, and Kwong, Olivia.,  (eds.), ''Linguistic Corpus and Corpus Linguistics in the Chinese Context'' ''(Journal of Chinese Linguistics Monograph Series No.25)''. Hong Kong: The Chinese University Press, pp. 447-471.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, Benjamin. (2016). Skipantism Revisited: Along with Neologisms and Terminological Truncation. In Chin, Chi-on Andy and Kwok, Bit-chee and Tsou, Benjamin K., (eds.), ''Commemorative Essays for Professor Yuen-Ren Chao: Father of Modern Chinese Linguistics''. Taiwan: Crane Publishing. pp. 343-357.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, LIVAC has allowed longitudinal developments to be taken into account, facilitating [[Key Word in Context]] (KWIC) and comprehensive study of target words and their underlying concepts as well as linguistic structures over the past 20 years, based on variables such as ''region'', ''duration'' and ''content''. Results from the extensive and accumulative data analysis contained in LIVAC have enabled the cultivation of textual databases of proper names, place names, organization names, new words, and bi-weekly and annual rosters of media figures. Related applications have included the establishment of verb and adjective databases, the formulation of sentiment indices, and related opinion mining, to measure and compare the popularity of global media figures in the Chinese media (LIVAC Annual Pan-Chinese Celebrity Rosters, later renamed as the Pan-Chinese Media Personalities Rosters)&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikisites.cityu.edu.hk/sites/newscentre/en/Pages/201512281400.aspx CityU releases 2015 LIVAC Pan-Chinese Media Personality Roster], [[City University of Hong Kong]], Hong Kong, 28 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikisites.cityu.edu.hk/sites/media/pr/Pages/2017010201.aspx CityU releases 2016 LIVAC Pan-Chinese Media Personality Roster], [[City University of Hong Kong]], Hong Kong, 02 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and construction of monthly new word lexicons (LIVAC Annual Pan-Chinese New Word Rosters).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikisites.cityu.edu.hk/sites/newscentre/en/Pages/201502121400.aspx CityU releases 2014 Pan-Chinese New Word Rosters], [[City University of Hong Kong]], Hong Kong, 12 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikisites.cityu.edu.hk/sites/newscentre/en/pages/201602041130.aspx CityU releases 2015 LIVAC Pan-Chinese New Word Rosters], [[City University of Hong Kong]], Hong Kong, 04 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, the analysis of the emergence, diffusion and transformation of new words, and the publication of dictionaries of [[neologism]]s have been made possible.&lt;ref&gt;鄒嘉彥、游汝杰（編）（2007），《21世紀華語新詞語詞典》（簡體字版），上海，復旦大學出版社。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;鄒嘉彥、游汝杰（編）（2010），《全球華語新詞語詞典》，北京，商務印書館。&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10127">[[File:East Africa, c.1500.jpg|thumb|The coast of eastern Africa, c.1500 (George McCall Theal, 1902)]]'''[[Maritime archaeology]] in East Africa''' spans the range from the horn of [[Somalia]] south to [[Mozambique]], and includes the various islands and island chains dotting the map off the coast of Somalia, Mozambique, [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]]. Primary areas along this coast include the [[Zanzibar]] (including the [[Mafia Island|Mafia islands]]), [[Lamu Archipelago|Lamu]], and [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] Archipelagos. Although East African societies developed nautical capabilities for themselves, most of the maritime artifacts point to external merchants from Mediterranean cultures like [[Egypt]] and [[Greece]], and [[China|Chinese]] from East Asia in the early stages, to the great European powers during the Ages of Colonization and Imperialism.

== Sea movement ==
While the use of ocean marine resources dates back to as early as 60 kya in South African sites such as [[Blombos Cave]], and later along the east coast, the record for the use of nautical technologies is less known. Based on dating of [[Later Stone Age|LSA]] sites in Zanzibar Cave on the island of Zanzibar, the use of nautical technology would date at least to the 7th or 8th century AD for the Tanzanian coastal cultures that moved from the mainland to inhabit the island. That date can be pushed back even further by sites discovered in the Mafia Archipelago, sites which suggest colonization during the [[Early Iron Age]], which has been dated to between the 1st and 6th century AD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The exact time of settlement is up for debate though, as studies performed in Kuumbi Cave show. Kuumbi Cave is located near the southeast coast of Zanzibar, based on artifacts dated from the site there is an argument presented that the residents of Zanzibar crossed over a land bridge that existed in the late Pliocene, before the sea level rose around 8000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shipton|first=Ceri|last2=Crowther|first2=Alison|last3=Kourampas|first3=Nikos|last4=Prendergast|first4=Mary E.|last5=Horton|first5=Mark|last6=Douka|first6=Katerina|last7=Schwenninger|first7=Jean-Luc|last8=Faulkner|first8=Patrick|last9=Morales|first9=Eréndira M.

This trade started long before the implementation of boats, but was made easier after the fact.[[File:Fishing Dhow (7969886158).jpg|thumb|Fishing dhow]]

=== African vessels ===
[[File:Sur-Dhow (2).JPG|thumb|Trade or transport dhow]]
When outside cultures like [[Culture of ancient Rome|Rome]] and China encountered the East African coast, they did not come to people foreign to the concept of boat usage, though the scale was much different. While both came in large trading vessels the local Africans relied more on vessels that kept close to the coast which were used more for local trading and fishing than long expeditions. East Africans to this day use a ship style called a [[dhow]] which was introduced by the Arabic merchants who came into the region. The dhow is not one particular ship design, but more of a class of ships, with sizes and schematics ranging from the smaller fishing dhow to the much larger shows used for transporting goods and passengers.

== Outside contact ==
East Africa has had a long history of connections to the global marketplace, having been a direct part of the [[Silk Road]] as early as the 1st century AD. It has become home to people of many ethnicities, including Arabic merchants and settlers, Chinese sailors, European merchants and remnants of the European colonial families, and the culture groups that are descended from those who were there to begin with.

=== Contact with Rome ===
Roman trade vessels would make the 3,000 nautical mile journey south from the important trade ports of [[Myos Hormos]] and [[Berenice Troglodytica|Berenice]] in Egypt to the African trade port of Zanzibar.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=284208|title=Rome's Trade with the East: The Sea Voyage to Africa and India on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exists to this day, what has been classified as a sea journal of a Roman pilot or merchant from the 1st century AD, this journal is called the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea|Periplus Maris Erythraei]],'' and it records the voyage of a Roman trade ship that sailed from the Red Sea south along the African coast.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Contact with China and East Asia ===
In the 1400s AD the East African coast encountered the trading fleets of China, led by [[Zheng He]], the Chinese trader and servant of the Emperor. From geophysical surveying of the coast around [[Lamu]] Kenya, archaeologists have discovered what appear to be Chinese porcelain artifacts dating to the 14th century AD, local legend and heritage has it that one or more Chinese vessels were lost in the area.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Contact with Arabia ===
Today, the East African coast has become almost synonymous with the term "[[Swahili coast]]", the Swahili coast being denoted by peoples of the [[Swahili culture]] which is a combination of Arabic language and culture and the language and culture of the native peoples of Africa. Much of the land range is the same, but the Swahili culture extends into the northern coast of Madagascar and into northern Somalia, Djibouti and Eritrea.

=== Contact with Europe ===
While European powers were familiar with the goods of Africa's east coast, it was not until their ships were able to get around the southern cape of Africa that their connections to the coast became direct. With the rush for land, resources and power beginning in the late 15th century AD by Europe, encountering the rich coast of East Africa was a goldmine, both figuratively and literally as cities like Mogadishu in Somalia and Sofala in Mozambique being hubs for gold obtained from the interior of the continent.

In Ngomeni Kenya, archaeologists discovered  16th century AD shipwreck which, along with certain artifacts found with the ship suggest European origins and Portuguese ownership. The artifacts in question are copper ingots marked with a seal of ownership, the seal being of a trident.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Important ports ==

* [[Stone Town]] (Mje Mkongwe) - Zanzibar, Tanzania
* [[Rhapta]] - Unknown
* [[Fort Jesus]] - Mombasa Island, Kenya
* [[Lamu]] - Lamu Island, Kenya
* [[Shanga, Pate Island|Shanga]] - Pate Island, Kenya
* [[Mogadishu]] - Somalia

== Underwater sites ==
While some underwater sites have been identified and are under analysis, little is known about the overall quantity and diversity of the wrecks to be found along the coast. In some cities along the coast, like [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] in Tanzania, and [[Lamu]] in Kenya, archaeologists have found images of Arabic ships carved into the walls of mosques, which are interpreted as being requests of protection for the ships carved.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pollard|first=Edward|last2=Bates|first2=Richard|last3=B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2410">Mars Surface Exploration '''(MSE)''' is a systems engineering tool for the design of [[rover (space exploration)|rover]] missions originally developed in 2003 by the Space Systems Engineering graduate class at [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;J.-A. Lamamy, '' Enhancing the Science Return of Mars Missions via Sample Preparation, Robotic Surface Exploration and in Orbit Fuel Production '', Massachusetts Institute of Technology, SERC #7-04, chap. 4, June 2004, available [http://ssl.mit.edu/publications/theses/SM-2004-LamamyJulien-Alexandre.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been further enhanced by the MIT Space Systems Laboratory with the support of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL). The tool is intended to help designers during pre-phase A rover mission design. MSE enables designers to model and analyze very rapidly a wide range of design options for a mission whose science goals have been defined. The emphasis is on breadth rather than on in-depth modeling of specific designs. Other rover modeling tools exist at NASA’s and ESA’s concurrent engineering facilities that take the approach of interconnecting sophisticated software design environments to conduct detailed analyses of a particular mission. MSE's approach complements in-depth modeling techniques which, in return, assist in the validation of MSE's models at various points of the design space.

==Analyses==
MSE has been used to analyze various types of missions ranging from traditional rover missions (e.g. [[Mars Science Laboratory]] and [[ExoMars]] &lt;ref&gt;J.-A. Lamamy, D. W. Miller, '' Designing the Next Generation of Rovers Through a Mid-Rover Analysis '', 9th ESA Workshop on Advanced Space Technologies for Robotics and Automation (ASTRA 2006), November 28–30, 2006, Noordwijk, the Netherlands, available [http://robotics.estec.esa.int/ASTRA/Astra2006/Papers/ASTRA2006-2.2.1.01.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;) to [[Mars Sample Return]]-type missions and Lunar missions.

# The unavoidably context-dependent and subjective nature of all concepts, compared to objective systems of validity. 
# The importance of examining embedded assumptions and of concentrating on the association between idea and context.
# The affirmation that appropriate theorizing is a certainty of our nature as language observers and directing theorists in the direction of improving awareness of their fundamental responsibility.
# The assertion that the concept of efficacy, instead of objective validity should be the fulcrum in the evaluation of theory.

{{History of war}}
In the field of [[military theory]], the '''operational level of war''' (also called the '''operational art''', as derived from {{lang-ru|оперативное искусство}}, or the '''operational warfare''') represents the level of command that connects the details of [[military tactics|tactics]] with the goals of [[strategy]].&lt;ref&gt;p.24, Simpkin&lt;/ref&gt;

In Joint U.S. military [[Military doctrine|doctrine]], '''operational art''' is "the cognitive approach by commanders and staffs—supported by their skill, knowledge, experience, creativity, and judgment—to develop strategies, campaigns, and operations to organize and employ military forces by integrating ends, ways, and means."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp5_0.pdf|title=Army Doctrine Reference Publication (ADRP) 5-0, The Operations Process|last=Department of the Army|first=|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=May 2012|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It correlates political needs and military power. Operational art is defined by its military-political scope, not by force size, scale of operations or degree of effort. Likewise, operational art provides theory and skills, and the operational level permits doctrinal structure and process.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

==Background==

During the 18th and early 19th centuries, the synonymous term '''grand tactics''' (or, less frequently, ''maneuver tactics''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hess |first1=Earl |title=Civil War Infantry Tactics: Training, Combat, and Small-Unit Effectiveness |date=2015 |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |location=Baton Rouge |isbn=978-0-8071-5937-8 |page=xxi |edition=fourth }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was often used to describe the manoeuvres of troops not tactically [[engagement (military)|engaged]], while in the late 19th century to the [[First World War]] and through the Second World War, the term '''minor strategy''' was used by some military commentators.&lt;ref&gt;p.218, Jablonsky&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p.28, Whitman&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion over terminology was brought up in professional military publications, that sought to identify "...slightly different shades of meaning, such as tactics, major tactics, minor tactics, grand strategy, major strategy, and minor strategy".&lt;ref&gt;p.3, Bundel&lt;/ref&gt; The term was not widely used in the United States or Britain before 1980–1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hLBANX5rTIsC&amp;pg=PA21 |title=The German 1918 Offensives: A Case Study in the Operational Level of War |isbn=9781134252251 |author1=Zabecki |first1=David T |pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QTFLUTXixXEC |publisher=DIANE Publishing |page=v |title=The Operational Level of War |isbn=9781428915749}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKGK_t8mYKAC&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;pg=PA175 |page=175 |title=Strategy and History |isbn=9780887380655 |author1=Luttwak |first1=Edward |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it became much discussed and started to enter military doctrines and officer combat training courses.&lt;ref&gt;p. 111, Stone&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Operational art comprises four essential elements: time, space, means and purpose. Each element is found in greater complexity at the operational level than at the tactical or strategic level. This is true, in part, because operational art must consider and incorporate more of the strategic and tactical levels than those levels must absorb from the operational level. Although much can be gained by examining the four elements independently, it is only when they are viewed together that operational art reveals its intricate fabric.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

The challenge of operational art is to establish a four-element equilibrium that permits the optimal generation and application of military power in achieving the political goal. Viewing time, space, means and purpose as a whole requires great skill in organizing, weighing and envisioning masses of complex, often contradictory factors. These factors often exist for extended periods, over great distances and with shifting mixes of players, systems and beliefs, pursuing political goals which may or may not be clear, cogent or settled. Compounding factors, such as the opponent's actions, create further ambiguity.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

===Mission analysis===
The operational-level strategist possesses numerous tools to frame and guide their thinking, but chief among these are mission analysis and end state. Mission analysis answers the question "What is to be accomplished?" Through mission analysis, the operational-level planner fuses political aims and military objectives. In so doing, the planner determines what application of military force will create military power to achieve the political purpose. Subordinate processes here include defining objectives and centers of gravity, but excessive dependence on analytical mechanisms can create false security. The final test rewards success, not the quality of the argument. Conversely, the planner cannot hope to "feel" a way to victory—complexity demands an integration of thought and effort.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

===End state===
End state answers the question "What will constitute success?" The campaign end state is not merely a desired status quo of the military goal. It also establishes a touchstone for the tactical, operational and strategic levels. The end state manifests the intended results of military power and exposes any limitations. Indeed, an achievable end state may require the employment of nonmilitary elements of national power. As such, it recognizes that military power alone may not be capable of attaining political success.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

==Skills required==
An operational-level strategy must continually inventory and weigh time, space, means and purpose, extrapolating from them outcomes and likelihood. To accomplish this, practitioners need both skill and theory, experience and knowledge. At the operational level, skills and experience must usually be developed indirectly, through formal training, military history and real-world practicum.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

Success at the tactical level is no guarantee of success at the operational level: mastery of operational art demands strategic skills. Without a strong grounding in the theory and application of operational art, a successful tactician has little hope of making the demanding leap from tactics. The operational level strategist must see clearly and expansively from the foxhole into the corridors of national or coalition authority. They must be aware of the plausibility and coherence of strategic aims, national will and the players who decide them. Successful operational art charts a clear, unbroken path from the individual soldier's efforts to the state or coalition's goals.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

== Role in historiography ==

While the emerging corpus of operational art and the establishment of a specifically operational level of war are relatively new, in practice operational art has existed throughout recorded history. Peoples and commanders have long pursued political goals through military actions, and one can examine campaigns of any period from the [[existential]] perspective of operational art. Current schools of thought on the operational art share the fundamental view that military success can be measured only in the attainment of political-strategic aims, and thus historians can analyze any war in terms of operational art.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

In the case of [[World War II]] analysis, the [[Wehrmacht]] did not use the operational level as a formal doctrinal concept during the campaigns of 1939–1945. While personnel within the German forces knew of operational art, awareness and practice was limited principally to [[German General Staff | general-staff]] trained officers. Nevertheless, the existential nature of operational art means that examining a campaign or an operation against political aims is valid irrespective of the doctrine or structures of the period. Thus the elements of operational art—time, space, means and purpose—can illuminate thoughts and actions of any era, regardless of the prevailing contemporary doctrine or structure.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

A '''phone connector''', also known as '''phone jack''', '''audio jack''', '''headphone jack''' or '''jack plug''', is a family of electrical connectors typically used for [[analog signal|analog audio signals]]. 

The phone connector was invented for use in [[telephone switchboard]]s in the 19th century and is still widely used. 

The phone connector is cylindrical in shape, with a grooved tip to retain it. In its original audio configuration, it typically has two, three, four and, occasionally, five contacts. Three-contact versions are known as ''TRS connectors'', where ''T'' stands for [[Tip and ring|"tip"]], ''R'' stands for [[Tip and ring|"ring"]] and ''S'' stands for "sleeve". Ring contacts are typically the same diameter as the sleeve, the long shank. Similarly, two-, four- and five- contact versions are called ''TS'', ''TRRS'' and ''TRRRS connectors'' respectively. The outside diameter of the "sleeve" conductor is {{convert|6.35|mm|in|abbr=off|frac=4}}. The "mini" connector has a diameter of {{convert|3.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} and the "sub-mini" connector has a diameter of {{convert|2.5|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

== Other terms ==
Specific models, and connectors used in specific applications, may be termed e.g. ''stereo plug'', ''headphone jack'', ''microphone jack'', ''aux input'', etc. The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm versions are commonly called ''mini-phone'', ''mini-stereo'', ''mini jack'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = International Library of Technology: ...&amp;nbsp;Principles of Telephony&amp;nbsp;... | publisher = International Textbook Company, Scranton, PA | year = 1907 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BFcJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA11-PA36&amp;dq=tip+ring+sleeve+date:0-1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|reason=No discussion of terminology here, just construction.|date=March 2018}}

In the UK, the terms ''jack plug'' and ''jack socket'' are commonly used for the respective male and female phone connectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Radio Production | author = Robert McLeish | publisher = Newnes | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JzJJ6kg3hLUC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;dq=%22jack+socket%22+%22jack+plug%22 | isbn = 0-240-51972-8 | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, a stationary (more fixed) [[electrical connector]] is called a ''jack''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Standard Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipments: IEEE 200-1975 (Reaffirmed 1988): Section 4.1.5.3 | publisher = IEEE and ANSI, New York, NY | year = 1975 | url = http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=ieee-200-1975&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipment: ASME Y14.44-2008 (Replaced IEEE 200-1975): Section 2.1.5.3 | publisher = ASME, Fairfield, NJ | year = 2008 | url = http://catalog.asme.org/Codes/PrintBook/Y1444_Reference_Designations.cfm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100313114131/http://catalog.asme.org/Codes/PrintBook/Y1444_Reference_Designations.cfm | archivedate = 2010-03-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''phone plug'' and ''phone jack'' are sometimes used to refer to different genders of phone connectors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Sound Reinforcement Handbook | author = Gary D.

Phone plugs and jacks are not to be confused with the similar terms ''phono plug'' and ''phono jack'' (or in the UK, ''phono socket'') which refer to [[RCA connector]]s common in consumer hi-fi and audiovisual equipment. The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm connector is, however, sometimes—but counter to the connector manufacturers' nomenclature&lt;ref name="not_mini_phono"/&gt;—referred to as ''mini phono''.&lt;ref name="mini-phono" /&gt;

=== Quarter-inch size ===
Modern phone connectors are available in three standard sizes. The original {{convert|1/4|in|mm|2}} version descends from as early as 1877, when the first-ever telephone switchboard was installed at 109 Court Street in Boston in a building owned by Charles Williams, Jr.;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newvision-sherwinpioneers.org/the-birthplace-of-the-telephone/|title=Birthplace of the Telephone|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lewis Dyer: Edison His Life And Inventions.

US 711556 A|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is today still used on mainstream musical equipment, especially on [[electric guitar]]s.

[[Western Electric]] was the manufacturing arm of the [[Bell System]], and thus originated or refined most of the engineering designs, including the telephone jacks and plugs which were later adopted by other industries, including the U.S. Military.

By 1907, Western Electric had designed a number of models for different purposes, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telephonecollectors.info/index.php/browse/document-repository/catalogs-manuals/western-electric/we-catalogs/11201-1907ca-weco-telephonic-apparatus-and-supplies-catalog-ocr-r-large-file/file|title=Western Electric Telephonic Apparatus and Supplies (1907)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Code No. 47 2-conductor plugs for use with type 3, 91, 99, 102, 103, 108, and 124 jacks--used for switchboards
* Code No. 85 3-conductor plugs for use with type 77 jacks--used for the operator's head telephone
* Code No. 103 twin 2-conductor plugs for use with type 91, and type 99 jacks--used for the operator's head telephone and chest transmitter (microphone)
* Code No. 109 3-conductor plugs for use with jack 92 on telephone switchboards (with the same basic shape as the modern Bantam plugs)
* Code No. 110, 3-conductor plug for use with jacks 49, 117, 118, 140, and 141 on switchboards
* Code No. 112, twin 2-conductor plug for use with jacks 91 and 99--used for the operator's head telephone and chest, with a transmitter cutout key (microphone mute)
* Code No. 116, 1-conductor plug for use with cordless jack boxes
* Code No. 126, 3-conductor plug for use with type 132 and type 309 jacks on portable street railway sets

By 1950, the two main plug designs were:

* WE-309 (compatible with {{frac|3|16}}-inch jacks, such as 246 jack), for use on high-density jack panels such as the 608A
* WE-310 (compatible with {{frac|1|4}}-inch jacks, such as the 242)

Several modern designs have descended from those earlier versions:

* B-Gauge standard BPO316 (not compatible with EIA RS-453)
* EIA RS-453: ''Dimensional, Mechanical and Electrical Characteristics Defining Phone Plugs &amp; Jacks'' standard of {{convert|0.206|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter, also found in IEC 60603-11:1992--''Connectors for frequencies below 3 MHz for use with printed boards - Part 11: Detail specification for concentric connectors (dimensions for free connectors and fixed connectors).''

==== Military variants ====
U.S. military versions of the Western Electric plugs were initially specified in Amendment No.1, MIL-P-642, and included:

* M642/1-1
* M642/1-2
* M642/2-1
* M642/2-2
* M642/4-1
* M642/4-2
* MIL-P-642/2, also known as PJ-051. (Similar to Western Electric WE-310, and thus not compatible with EIA RS-453)
* MIL-P-642/5A: Plug, Telephone (TYPE PJ-068) and Accessory Screws (1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carlsonmfg.com/resources/military-specifications-1/1528-mil-dtl-642-5b-pdf-1/file|title=MIL-DTL-642/5B|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and MIL-DTL-642F: Plugs, Telephone, and Accessory Screws (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://landandmaritimeapps.dla.mil/Downloads/MilSpec/Docs/MIL-DTL-642/dtl642.pdf|title=MIL-DTL-642F: Plugs, Telephone, and Accessory Screws|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with {{convert|0.206|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter, also known by the earlier Signal Corps PL-68 designation. These are commonly used as the microphone jack for aviation radios, and on Collins S-line and many Drake amateur radios. MIL-DTL-642F states, "This specification covers telephone plugs used in telephone (including telephone switchboard consoles), telegraph, and teletype circuits, and for connecting headsets, handsets, and microphones into communications circuits."

=== Miniature size ===
The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm or ''miniature'' size was originally designed in the 1950s as two-conductor connectors for earpieces on [[transistor radio]]s, and remains a standard still used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/apple-iphone-headphone-jack-history-1.3755120|title=All-right jack: Simple but effective plug-in has endured for more than a century|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This roughly half-sized version of the original, popularized by the Sony EFM-117J radio (released in 1964),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony history 1960s|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|website=Sony official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Description of 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm earphone jack in described model: {{cite web|url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/vintage-sony-1960-efm-117j-radio-47603127|title=Vintage Sony 1960’S EFM-117J Radio|website=[[WorthPoint]]|accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|reason=Self-published source. Marginally verifies that the radio exists. We need something that at least talks about the phone connector.|date=July 2018}} is still commonly used in portable applications. It became very popular with its application on the [[Walkman]] in 1979, as unlike earlier transistor radios, these devices had no speaker of their own; the usual way to listen to them was to plug in headphones. There is also an EIA standard for 0.141-inch miniature phone jacks.

The 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm or ''sub-miniature'' sizes were similarly popularized on small portable electronics. They often appeared next to a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm microphone jack for a remote control on-off switch on early portable tape recorders; the microphone provided with such machines had the on-off switch and used a two-pronged connector with both the 3.5 and 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm plugs. They were also used for low-voltage DC power input from wall adapters. In the latter role they were soon replaced by coaxial [[DC power connector]]s. 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm phone jacks have also been used as the headset jacks on mobile telephones (see {{section link||PDAs and mobile phones}}). 

The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm and 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm sizes are sometimes referred to as {{frac|1|8}}&amp;nbsp;in and {{frac|3|32}}&amp;nbsp;in respectively in the United States, though those dimensions are only approximations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=3.5&amp;nbsp;mm Stereo Plug |url=http://www.cui.com/product/resource/sp-3501.pdf |publisher=CUI Inc. |access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; All sizes are now readily available in two-conductor (unbalanced mono) and three-conductor ([[balanced audio|balanced]] mono or unbalanced [[stereophonic sound|stereo]]) versions.

Four-conductor versions of the 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm plug and jack are used for certain applications. A four-conductor version is often used in compact [[camcorder]]s and portable media players, providing stereo sound and composite analog video. It is also used as a combined stereo headphone and microphone connector (i.e. a [[headset (audio)|headset]] connector) on some laptop computers, most [[#Mobile phones|mobile phones]], and on some handheld [[amateur radio]] transceivers from [[Yaesu (brand)|Yaesu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ad7gd.net/vx6/datacable.html|title=Build a Data Cable for the Yaesu VX-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some headphone amplifiers have used it to connect "balanced" stereo headphones, which require two conductors per audio channel as the channels do not share a common ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.lhlabs.com/support/solutions/articles/5000650338-geek-out-v2-user-manual|title=Geek Out V2+ User Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

=== Broadcast usage ===
By the 1940s, broadcast radio stations were using Western Electric Code No. 103 plugs and matching jacks for patching audio throughout studios. This connector was used because of its use in AT&amp;T's Long Line circuits for distribution of audio programs over the radio networks' leased telephone lines. Because of the large amount of space these patch panels required, the industry began switching to 3-conductor plugs and jacks in the late 1940s, using the WE Type 291 plug with WE type 239 jacks. The type 291 plug was used instead of the standard type 110 switchboard plug because the location of the large bulb shape on this TRS plug would have resulted in both audio signal connections being shorted together for a brief moment while the plug is being inserted and removed. The Type 291 plug avoids this by having a shorter tip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chinn|first=Howard|date=July 1947|title=Single Jacks for Broadcast Application|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-NAB-Engineering/NAB-4th-Edition/Section-5--NAB-Engineering-4th-Edition.pdf|journal=Audio Engineering|volume=31, number 6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patch bay connectors ===
The professional audio field and the telecommunication industry use a {{convert|0.173|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter plug, associated with trademarked names including Bantam, TT, Tini-Telephone, and Tini-Tel. They are not compatible with standard EIA RS-453/IEC 60603-11 1/4-inch jacks. In addition to a slightly smaller diameter, they have a slightly different geometry.&lt;ref name="soundonsound-2007-05" /&gt; The three-conductor (TRS for Tip-Ring-Shield) versions are capable of handling [[balanced line]] signals and are used in professional audio installations.

Less commonly used sizes, both diameters and lengths, are also available from some manufacturers, and are used when it is desired to restrict the availability of matching connectors, such as 0.210&amp;nbsp;inch inside diameter jacks for fire safety communication jacks in public buildings, the same size found in discontinued [[Bell &amp; Howell]] 16&amp;nbsp;mm projector speaker jacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smartdata.usbid.com/datasheets/dsid/145849.pdf|title=Switchcraft ''Telephone Jack and Telephone Plug Mating Chart''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aadoublejackplug.jpg|thumb|A dual 310 patch cable, two-pin phone plug]]

* A two-pin version, known to the telecom industry as a "310 connector", consists of two phone {{frac|1|4}} inch phone plugs at a centre spacing of {{convert|5/8|in|mm}}. The socket versions of these can be used with normal phone plugs provided the plug bodies are not too large, but the plug version will only mate with two sockets at {{frac|5|8}}&amp;nbsp;inches centre spacing, or with line sockets, again with sufficiently small bodies. These connectors are still widely used today in telephone company central offices on "DSX" patch panels for DS1 circuits. A similar type of 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm connector is often used in the armrests of older aircraft, as part of the on-board [[in-flight entertainment]] system. Plugging a stereo plug into one of the two mono jacks typically results in the audio coming into only one ear. Adapters are available.
* A short-barrelled version was used for 20th century high-impedance mono headphones, and in particular those used in [[World War II aircraft]]. It is physically possible to use a normal plug in a short socket, but a short plug will neither lock into a normal socket nor complete the tip circuit. These have become rare.

==Aviation and US military connectors==
US military phone connectors include both 0.25&amp;nbsp;in (6.35&amp;nbsp;mm) and 0.21&amp;nbsp;in (5.34&amp;nbsp;mm) diameter plugs, which both mate with the M641-series open frame jacks, exemplified by Switchcraft C11 and C12 jacks.

Military specifications and standards relating to phone connectors include MIL-STD 202, MIL-P-642/*, and MIL-J-641.

=== Headphones ===
Commercial and [[general aviation]] (GA) civil airplane headset plugs are similar, but not identical. A standard {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in monaural plug, type PL-55&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radionerds.com/index.php/PL-55|title=PL-55|last=|first=|date=|website=Radionerds.com|access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (both two-conductor phone plugs, a.k.a. PJ-055B, which mate with JK-24 and JK-34A jacks) is used for headphones. On many newer GA aircraft the headphone jack is a standard {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in phone connector wired in the standard unbalanced stereo configuration instead of the PJ-055 to allow stereo music sources to be reproduced.

=== Microphones ===
Aviation headphones are paired with special tip-ring-sleeve, 0.206&amp;nbsp;inch/5.23&amp;nbsp;mm diameter plug, type PJ-068 (PL-68&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radionerds.com/index.php/PL-68|title=PL-68|last=|first=|date=|website=Radionerds.com|access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, for the microphone. The PJ-068 mates with a JK-33 jack (Switchcraft C-12B), and is similar to the Western Electric plug WE-109.

In the microphone plug the Ring is used for the microphone 'hot' and the sleeve is common or microphone 'Lo'. The extra (tip) connection in the microphone plug is often left unconnected but is also sometimes used for various functions, most commonly an optional push-to-talk switch, but on some aircraft it carries headphone audio and on others a DC supply.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[File:Aircraft plug.gif|thumb|Aviation plug type U-174/U or Nexus TP120, commonly used on military aircraft and civil helicopters]]

=== Helicopter headsets ===
Military aircraft and civil helicopters have another type termed a U-174/U. These are also termed 'NATO plugs' or Nexus TP120&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nexinc.thomasnet.com/item/all-categories/telephone-plugs/tp-120|title=Item # TP-120, Telephone Plug|work=|publisher=Amphenol Nexus Technologies, Inc|accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; phone plugs. They are similar to {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in (6.35&amp;nbsp;mm) plug, but with a {{convert|7.10|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter short shaft with an extra ring, i.e. four conductors in total, allowing two for the headphones (mono), and two for the microphone. There is a confusingly similar four pole (or four conductor) British connector with a slightly smaller diameter and a different wiring configuration used for headsets in many UK Military aircraft and often also referred to as a NATO or 'UK NATO' connector.

== Mono and stereo compatibility ==

[[File:2-conductor male TS connectors.jpg|thumb|right|Modern profile 2-conductor male {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in TS connectors]]

The original application for the 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in) phone jack was in manual telephone exchanges.&lt;ref name="ParekhRanjan2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ranjan Parekh|author2=Ranjan|title=Principles of Multimedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TaNmc2IdNVwC&amp;pg=PA225|year=2006|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-058833-2|pages=225–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many different configurations of these phone plugs were used, some accommodating five or more conductors, with several tip profiles. Of these many varieties, only the two-conductor version with a rounded tip profile was compatible between different manufacturers, and this was the design that was at first adopted for use with [[microphone]]s, [[electric guitar]]s, [[headphones]], [[loudspeaker]]s, and many other items of audio equipment.

When a three-conductor version of the 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm jack was introduced for use with [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] headphones, it was given a sharper tip profile in order to make it possible to manufacture jacks (sockets) that would accept only stereo plugs, to avoid short-circuiting the right channel of the amplifier. This attempt has long been abandoned, and now the convention is that all plugs fit all sockets of the same size, regardless of whether they are balanced or unbalanced, mono or stereo. Most 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm plugs, mono or stereo, now have the profile of the original stereo plug, although a few rounded mono plugs are also still produced. The profiles of stereo miniature and subminiature plugs have always been identical to the mono plugs of the same size.

The results of this physical compatibility are:
*If a two-conductor plug of the same size is connected to a three-conductor socket, the result is that the ring (right channel) of the socket is grounded. This property is deliberately used in several applications. However, grounding one channel may also be dangerous to the equipment if the result is to [[short circuit]] the output of the right channel [[amplifier]]. In any case, any signal from the right channel is naturally lost.
*If a three-conductor plug is connected to a two-conductor socket, normally the result is to leave the ring of the plug unconnected (open circuit). In the days of [[vacuum tube]]s this was also potentially dangerous to equipment but most solid-state devices tolerate this condition well. A three-conductor socket could be wired as an unbalanced mono socket to ground the ring in this situation, but the more conventional wiring is to leave the ring unconnected, exactly simulating a mono socket.
*If a male three-conductor plug is partially inserted into a female two-conductor socket such that the female ring contact bridges the gap of the male plug tip and first ring, then an identical signal will be connected to both these conductors, thus simulating a "Y" connection. This is not a reliable connection and is only useful in a test or emergency situation. Analog low and line level audio circuits usually tolerate this well if the volume (current) is not excessive, though other circuits may not because of the typical surge current that occurs at the moment all three conductors engage. Common example of condition: a typical 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm earphone socket of a mono radio or micro amp has a stereo headphone plug partly inserted. Mono audio should be delivered to both speakers if the plug depth is carefully adjusted in the socket.

Because of a lack of standardization in the past regarding the dimensions (length) given to the ring conductor and the insulating portions on either side of it in 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in) phone connectors and the width of the conductors in different brands and generations of sockets, there are occasional issues with compatibility between differing brands of plug and socket. This can result in a contact in the socket bridging (shorting) the ring and sleeve contacts on a phone connector.

The most common arrangement remains to have the male plug on the cable and the female socket mounted in a piece of equipment: the original intention of the design. A considerable variety of line plugs and panel sockets is available, including plugs suiting various cable sizes, right-angle plugs, and both plugs and sockets in a variety of price ranges and with current capacities up to 15 [[ampere]]s for certain heavy duty {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in versions intended for [[loudspeaker]] connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fullcompass.com/product/292346.html |title=Switchcraft Z15J 1/4" High Power Speaker Jack |publisher=Full Compass |accessdate=October 24, 2011 |quote=High power 2-conductor speaker jack carries 15A (continuous) audio speaker current levels.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common uses of phone plugs and their matching sockets are:

*[[Headphone]] and [[earphone]] jacks on a wide range of equipment. 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in) plugs are common on home and professional component equipment, while 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm plugs are nearly universal for portable audio equipment. 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm plugs are not as common, but are used on communication equipment such as [[cordless phone]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, and [[two-way radio]]s.
* Consumer electronics devices such as [[digital cameras]], [[camcorders]], and [[portable DVD player]]s use 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm connectors for composite video and audio output. Typically, a TRS connection is used for mono unbalanced audio plus video, and a TRRS connection for stereo unbalanced audio plus video. Cables designed for this use are often terminated with [[RCA connectors]] on the other end. Sony also used this style of connection as the TV-Out on some models of VAIO laptop.
* Hands-free sets and headsets often use 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm or 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm connectors. Phone connectors are used for mono audio out and an unbalanced microphone (with a shared ground). Four-conductor TRRS phone connectors are used to add an additional audio channel such as microphone input added to stereo output. TRRS connectors used for this purpose are sometimes interoperable with TRS connectors, depending on how the contacts are used.
*[[Microphone]] inputs on tape and cassette recorders, sometimes with remote control switching on the ring, on early, monaural cassette recorders mostly a dual-pin version consisting of a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TS for the microphone and a 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm TS for remote control which switches the recorder's power supply.
*Patching points ([[Insert (effects processing)|insert points]]) on a wide range of equipment.
*[[Personal computers]], sometimes using a [[sound card]] plugged into the computer. Stereo 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm jacks are used for:
**Line in (stereo)
**Line out (stereo)
**Headphones/loudspeaker out (stereo)
**Microphone input (mono, usually with 5&amp;nbsp;V power available on the ring. Note that traditional, incompatible, use of a stereo plug for a mono microphone is for balanced output)
**Older [[laptop computers]] generally have one jack for headphones and one mono jack for a microphone at microphone level. An attenuating cable can be used to convert [[line level]] or use a signal from an [[XLR connector]], but is not designed to record from a stereo device such as a radio or music player. Newer computers may feature a single TRRS female jack ([[#Computer sound|see below]]).
** [[Moog synthesizer]]s and plug modifiable synthesizers.
**LCD monitors with built-in speakers will need a cable with 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm male TRS plugs on each end to connect to the sound card.
**: Note: Some higher-end sound cards provide a breakout panel which supports {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in plug devices as well.
*Devices designed for surround output may use multiple jacks for paired channels (e.g. TRS for front left and right; TRRS for front center, rear center, and subwoofer; and TRS for surround left and right). Circuitry on the sound device may be used to switch between traditional Line In/Line Out/Mic functions and surround output.
*[[Electric guitar]]s. Almost all electric guitars use a {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in mono jack (socket) as their output connector. Some makes (such as [[Shergold]]) use a stereo jack instead for stereo output, or a second stereo jack, in addition to a mono jack (as with [[Rickenbacker]]).
*[[Instrument amplifier]]s for guitars, basses and similar amplified [[musical instrument]]s. {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in jacks are overwhelmingly the most common connectors for:
**Inputs. A shielded cable with a mono {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in phone plug on each end is commonly termed a ''guitar cable'' or a ''patch cable'', the first name reflecting this usage, the second the history of the phone plug's development for use in manual telephone exchanges.
**[[Loudspeaker]] outputs, especially on low-end equipment. On professional loudspeakers, [[Speakon]] connectors carry higher current, mate with greater contact area, lock in place and do not short out the amplifier upon insertion or disconnection. However, some professional loudspeakers carry both Speakon and TRS connectors for compatibility. Heavy-duty {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in loudspeaker jacks are rated at 15&amp;nbsp;A maximum which limits them to applications involving less than 1,800 watts. {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in loudspeaker jacks commonly are not rigged to lock the plug in place and will short out the amplifier's output circuitry if connected or disconnected when the amplifier is live.
**Line outputs.
**Foot switches and effects pedals. Stereo plugs are used for double switches (for example by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]). There is little compatibility between makers.
**Effects loops, which are normally wired as patch points.
*[[Electronic keyboard]]s use jacks for a similar range of uses to guitars and amplifiers, and in addition
**Sustain pedals.
**Expression pedals.
*[[Electronic drum]]s use jacks to connect sensor pads to the [[synthesizer]] module or [[MIDI]] encoder. In this usage, a change in voltage on the wire indicates a drum stroke.
*Some compact and/or economy model audio [[mixing desk]]s use stereo jacks for balanced microphone inputs.
*The majority of professional audio equipment uses TS jacks as the standard unbalanced input or output line-level connector. TRS jacks are sometimes used for balanced connections, the latter often alongside (or sometimes in the middle of) and as an alternative to an [[XLR connector|XLR]] balanced line connector.
* [[Modular synthesizer]]s commonly use monophonic cables for creating [[patch (synthesizer)|patches]].
* Quarter-inch phone connectors are widely used to connect external processing devices to [[mixing console]]s' insert points (see [[Insert (effects processing)]]). Two- or three-conductor phone connectors might be used in pairs as separate ''send'' and ''return'' jacks, or a single three-conductor phone jack might be employed for both ''send'' and ''return'', in which case the signals are unbalanced. The one unbalanced combination send/return TRS insert jack saves both panel space and component complexity, but may introduce a slight [[Mains hum|buzz]]. Insert points on mixing consoles may also be XLR, RCA or bantam TT (tiny telephone) jacks, depending on the make and model.
*Some small electronic devices such as audio cassette players, especially in the cheaper price brackets, use a two-conductor 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm or 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm phone jack as a [[DC connector|DC power connector]].
*Some photographic studio [[strobe]] lights have {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in or 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm jacks for the [[flash synchronization]] input. A camera's electrical flash output (PC socket or [[hot shoe]] adapter) is cabled to the strobe light's sync input jacks. Some examples: Calumet Travelite, and Speedotron use a {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in mono jack as the sync input; White Lightning uses {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in stereo jacks; PocketWizard (radio trigger) and AlienBees use 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm mono jacks.
*Some cameras (for example, Canon, Sigma, and Pentax [[DSLR]]s) use the 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm stereo jack for the connector for the remote shutter release (and focus activation); examples are Canon's RS-60E3 remote switch and Sigma's CR-21 wired remote control.
*Some miniaturized electronic devices use 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm or 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm jacks as [[serial port]] connectors for data transfer and unit programming. This technique is particularly common on [[graphing calculators]], such as the [[TI-83 series]], and some types of [[amateur radio|amateur]] and [[two-way radio]], though in some more modern equipment [[Universal Serial Bus|USB mini-B]] connectors are provided in addition to or instead of jack connectors. The second-generation [[iPod Shuffle]] from Apple has one TRRS jack which serves as headphone, USB, or power supply, depending on the connected plug.
* Samsung YP-S MP3 player "pebble" uses USB-to-3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TRRS jack adapter for charging as well as for data transfer.
* On [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras and video encoders, mono audio in (originating from a microphone in or near the camera) and mono audio out (destined to a speaker in or near the camera) are provided on one three-conductor connector, where one signal is on the tip conductor and the other is on the ring conductor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resource.boschsecurity.com/documents/Operation_Guide_enUS_1555473931.pdf, page 113] (PDF) boschsecurity.com Retrieved January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Atari 2600 (Video Computer System), the first widely popular home video game console with interchangeable software programs, used a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TS (two conductor) jack for 9&amp;nbsp;V 500&amp;nbsp;mA DC power. Later systems included the [[ZX Spectrum]] (for loading software from cassette) and the [[Sega Mega Drive]] (for stereo audio output).
* The [[Apple Lisa]] personal computer used a three-conductor TRS phone connector for its keyboard.
* The Sangean DCR-200 radio uses a wire aerial terminating with a 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm phone connector.

[[Personal computer]] [[sound card]]s, such as [[Creative Labs]]' [[Sound Blaster]] line, use a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm phone connector as a mono microphone input, and deliver a 5&amp;nbsp;V polarizing voltage on the ring to power [[electret microphone]]s. Sometimes termed ''phantom power'', this is not a suitable power source for microphones designed for true [[phantom power]] and is better termed ''bias voltage''. (Note that this is not a polarizing voltage for the condenser, as [[electret]]s by definition have an intrinsic voltage; it is power for a [[FET]] preamplifier built into the microphone.) Compatibility between different manufacturers is unreliable.

The [[Apple Inc|Apple]] [[PlainTalk]] microphone jack used on some older Macintosh systems is designed to accept an extended 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm three-conductor phone connector; in this case, the tip carries power for a [[preamplifier]] inside the microphone. If a PlainTalk-compatible microphone is not available, the jack can accept a [[line-level]] sound input, though it cannot accept a standard microphone without a preamp.

Normally, 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm three-conductor sockets are used in computer sound cards for stereo output. Thus, for a sound card with 5.1 output, there will be three sockets to accommodate six channels: "front left and right", "surround left and right", and "center + subwoofer". 6.1 and 7.1 channel sound cards from Creative Labs, however, use a single three-conductor socket (for the ''front'' speakers) and two 4-conductor sockets. This is to accommodate rear-center (6.1) or rear left and right (7.1) channels without the need for additional sockets on the sound card. (Note that Creative's documentation uses the word "pole" instead of "conductor".)

Some portable computers have a combined 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[TOSLINK|TRS-TOSLINK]] jack, supporting stereo audio output using a TRS connector, or TOSLINK (stereo or 5.1 [[Dolby Digital]]/[[DTS (sound system)|DTS]]) digital output using a suitable optical adapter. Most iMac computers have this digital/analog combo output feature as standard, with early MacBooks having two ports, one for analog/digital audio input and other for output. Support for input was dropped on various later models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macaudiopro.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=69934|title=''Questions Answered 4: Optical Output on the Mac''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=900687|title=''Audio input/output on Macbook computers.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some newer computers, such as Lenovo laptops, have 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TRRS headset sockets, which are compatible with phone headsets and may be distinguished by a headset icon instead of the usual headphones or microphone icons. These are particularly used for [[Voice over IP]].

== Video ==
[[File:TRRS_3.5mm_-_2_length_variants.jpg|thumb|Different length 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TRRS connectors]]

Equipment requiring video with stereo audio input/output sometimes uses 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TRRS connectors. Two incompatible variants exist, of {{convert|15|mm}} and {{convert|17|mm|abbr=on}} length, and using the wrong variant may either simply not work, or could cause physical damage.

Attempting to fully insert the longer (17&amp;nbsp;mm) plug into a receptacle designed for the shorter (15&amp;nbsp;mm) plug may damage the receptacle, and may damage any electronics located immediately behind the receptacle. However, partially inserting the plug will work as the tip/ring/ring distances are the same for both variants.

Using the shorter plug in a socket designed for the longer connector will result in the plug not 'locking in', and may additionally result in wrong signal routing and/or a short circuit inside the equipment (e.g. the plug tip may cause the contacts inside the receptacle - tip/ring 1, etc. - to short together).

The shorter 15&amp;nbsp;mm TRRS variant is more common and fully physically compatible with 'standard' 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TRS and TS connectors.

== Recording equipment ==

[[File:Jackplug-wiring.svg|thumb|right|Stereo devices which use "plug-in power": the electret capsules are wired in this way.]]

Many small video cameras, laptops, recorders and other consumer devices use a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm microphone connector for attaching a (mono/stereo) microphone to the system.
These fall into three categories:
* Devices that use an un-powered microphone: usually a cheap [[Microphones#Dynamic microphone|dynamic]] or [[Microphones#Piezoelectric microphone|piezoelectric]] microphone. The microphone generates its own voltage, and needs no power.
* Devices that use a self-powered microphone: usually a [[Microphones#Condenser microphone|condenser]] microphone with internal battery-powered amplifier.
* Devices that use a "plug-in powered" microphone: an [[electret microphone]] containing an internal [[Field-effect transistor|FET]] amplifier. These provide a good quality signal, in a very small microphone. However, the internal FET needs a DC power supply, which is provided as a bias voltage for an internal preamp transistor.

Plug-in power is supplied on the same line as the audio signal, using an RC filter. The DC bias voltage supplies the FET amplifier (at a low current), while the capacitor decouples the DC supply from the AC input to the recorder. Typically, V=1.5 V, R=1 kΩ, C=47&amp;nbsp;µF.

If a recorder provides plug-in power, and the microphone does not need it, everything will usually work ok, although the sound quality may be lower than expected, as the microphone may not work optimally with a constant DC current flowing through it. In the converse case (recorder provides no power; microphone needs power), no sound will be recorded. Neither misconfiguration will damage consumer hardware, but providing power when none is needed could destroy a broadcast-type microphone.

== PDAs and mobile phones ==

[[File:iPod and iPhone audio plugs.JPG|thumb|All [[iPhone]] models from the first generation to the 6S and SE use a four-conductor (TRRS) phone connector (center) for a wired headset. Microphone and control (right).]]
Three- or four-conductor (TRS or TRRS) 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm and 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm sockets are common on [[cell phone]]s, providing mono (three conductor) or stereo (four conductor) sound and a microphone input, together with signaling (e.g., push a button to answer a call). Three-conductor 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm connectors are particularly common on older phones, while four-conductor 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm connectors are more common on newer smartphones. These are used both for [[handsfree]] [[Headset (audio)|headsets]] (esp. mono audio plus mic, also stereo audio plus mic, plus signaling for call handling) and for (stereo) headphones (stereo audio, no mic). Wireless (connectorless) headsets or headphones usually use the [[Bluetooth]] protocol.

There is no recognised standard for TRRS connectors or compatibility with three conductor TRS. The four conductors of a TRRS connector are assigned to different purposes by different manufacturers. Any 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm plug can be plugged mechanically into any socket, but many combinations are electrically incompatible. For example, plugging TRRS headphones into a TRS headset socket (or vice versa) or plugging TRRS headphones from one manufacturer into a TRRS socket from another may not function correctly, or at all. Mono audio will usually work, but stereo audio or microphone may not work, depending on wiring. Signaling compatibility depends both on wiring compatibility and the signals sent by the hands-free/headphones controller being correctly interpreted by the phone.{{original research inline|date=November 2012}} Adapters that are wired for headsets will not work for stereo headphones and conversely. Further, as TTY/[[Telecommunications device for the deaf|TDD]]s are wired as headsets, TTY adapters can also be used to connect a 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm headset to a phone.

3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TRRS (stereo-plus-mic) sockets became particularly common on [[smartphones]], and have been used e.g. by Nokia since 2006; they are often compatible with standard 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm stereo headphones. Two different forms are frequently found, both of which place left audio on the tip and right audio on the first ring (mirroring the configuration found on stereo connectors). Where they differ is in the placement of the microphone and return contacts. The first, which places the ground return on the second ring and the microphone on the sleeve, is used by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPhone]] line, [[HTC]] devices, recent [[Samsung]], [[Nokia]], and [[Sony Mobile Communications|Sony]] phones, among others. The second, which reverses these contacts, is used by older Nokia mobiles, older [[Samsung]] smartphones, and some [[Sony Ericsson]] phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.meelec.com/Articles.asp?ID=155#Compatibility |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227131931/https://www.meelec.com/Articles.asp?ID=155#Compatibility |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-12-27 |title=MEElectronics - P version headset earphone compatibility |publisher=Meelec.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some adapters switch the last two conductors to allow a device made to one standard to be used with a headset made to the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digital-silence.com/support.html Digital Silence (earphone manufacturer)]: explanation of TRRS connectors and availability of adapter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some computers now include a TRRS headset socket, compatible with headsets intended for smartphones. One such pin assignment, with ground on the sleeve, is standardized in [[OMTP]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omtp.org/OMTP_Local_Connectivity_Wired_Analogue_Audio_v1_0.pdf|title=Wired Analogue Audio|accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been accepted as a national Chinese standard YDT 1885-2009.

=== TRRRS standards ===
New TRRRS standard for 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm connectors was developed and recently approved by ITU-T.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/itu-t/workprog/wp_item.aspx?isn=9990|title=ITU-T Work Programme|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new standard, called P.382 (formerly P.MMIC), outlines technical requirements and test methods for a 5-pole socket and plug configuration. Compared to legacy TRRS standard TRRRS provides one extra line that can be used for connecting a second microphone or external power to/from the audio accessory. P.382 requires compliant sockets and plugs to be backwards compatible with legacy TRRS and TRS connectors. Therefore, P.382 compliant TRRRS connectors should allow for seamless integration when used on new products. TRRRS connectors enable following audio applications: active noise cancelling, binaural recording and others, where dual analogue microphone lines can be directly connected to a host device.

== Switch contacts ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2007}}
[[File:Small jack plugs.jpg|thumb|Miniature phone plugs and jacks. All are 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm except the gold-plated plug, which is 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm. One of the 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm jacks is two-conductor and the others are three conductor. In this collection the tan-colored jacks have normally-closed switches.]]

Panel-mounting jacks are often provided with switch contacts. Most commonly, a mono jack is provided with one normally closed (NC) contact, which is connected to the tip (live) connection when no plug is in the socket, and disconnected when a plug is inserted. Stereo sockets commonly provide two such NC contacts, one for the tip (left channel live) and one for the ring or collar (right channel live). Some designs of jack also have such a connection on the sleeve. As this contact is usually ground, it is not much use for signal switching, but could be used to indicate to electronic circuitry that the socket was in use.

Less commonly, some jacks are provided with normally open (NO) or change-over contacts, and/or the switch contacts may be isolated from the connector.

The original purpose of these contacts was for switching in telephone exchanges, for which there were many patterns. Two sets of change-over contacts, isolated from the connector contacts, were common. The more recent pattern of one NC contact for each signal path, internally attached to the connector contact, stems from their use as headphone jacks. In many amplifiers and equipment containing them, such as electronic organs, a headphone jack is provided that disconnects the loudspeakers when in use. This is done by means of these switch contacts. In other equipment, a dummy load is provided when the headphones are not connected. This is also easily provided by means of these NC contacts.

Other uses for these contacts have been found. One is to interrupt a signal path to enable other circuitry to be inserted. This is done by using one NC contact of a stereo jack to connect the tip and ring together when no plug is inserted. The tip is then made the output, and the ring the input (or vice versa), thus forming a [[patch point]].

Another use is to provide alternative mono or stereo output facilities on some guitars and electronic organs. This is achieved by using two mono jacks, one for left channel and one for right, and wiring the NC contact on the right channel jack to the tip of the other, to connect the two connector tips together when the right channel output is not in use. This then mixes the signals so that the left channel jack doubles as a mono output.

Where a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm or 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm jack is used as a DC power inlet connector, a switch contact may be used to disconnect an internal battery whenever an external power supply is connected, to prevent incorrect recharging of the battery.

A standard stereo jack is used on most battery-powered guitar [[effects pedal]]s to eliminate the need for a separate power switch. In this configuration, the internal battery has its negative terminal wired to the sleeve contact of the jack. When the user plugs in a two-conductor (mono) guitar or microphone lead, the resulting short-circuit between sleeve and ring connects an internal battery to the unit's circuitry, ensuring that it powers up or down automatically whenever a signal lead is inserted or removed. A drawback of this design is the risk of inadvertently discharging the battery if the lead is not removed after use, such as if the equipment is left plugged in overnight.

The most common circuit configurations are the simple mono and stereo jacks (A and B); however there are a great number of variants manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Schematics table|url=http://www.switchcraft.com/Documents/Jack_Schematics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A two-conductor TS phone connector. The connection to the sleeve is the rectangle towards the right, and the connection to the tip is the line with the notch. Wiring connections are illustrated as white circles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A three-conductor TRS phone connector. The upper connector is the tip, as it is farther away from the sleeve. The sleeve is shown connected directly to the chassis, a very common configuration. This is the typical configuration for a balanced connection. Some jacks have metal mounting connections (which would make this connection) and some have plastic, to isolate the sleeve from the chassis, and provide a separate sleeve connection point, as in ''A''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This three-conductor jack has two isolated [[Contact terminology|SPDT]] [[switch]]es. They are activated by a plug going into the jack, which disconnects one throw and connects the other. The white arrowheads indicate a mechanical connection, while the black arrowheads indicate an electrical connection. This would be useful for a device that turns on when a plug is inserted, and off otherwise, with the power routed through the switches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This three-conductor jack has two normally closed switches connected to the contacts themselves. This would be useful for a patch point, for instance, or for allowing another signal to feed the line until a plug is inserted. The switches open when a plug is inserted. A common use for this style of connector is a stereo headphone jack that shuts off the default output (speakers) when the connector is plugged in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;]]

=== Balanced audio ===

When a phone connector is used to make a [[balanced audio connector|balanced]] connection, the two active conductors are both used for a [[monaural]] signal. The ring, used for the right channel in stereo systems, is used instead for the inverting input. This is a common use in small audio [[mixing desk]]s, where space is a premium and they offer a more compact alternative to [[XLR connector]]s. Another advantage offered by TRS phone connectors used for balanced microphone inputs is that a standard unbalanced signal lead using a TS phone jack can simply be plugged into such an input. The ring (right channel) contact then makes contact with the plug body, correctly grounding the inverting input.

A disadvantage of using phone connectors for balanced audio connections is that the ground mates last and the socket grounds the plug tip and ring when inserting or disconnecting the plug. This causes bursts of hum, cracks and pops and may stress some outputs as they will be short circuited briefly, or longer if the plug is left half in.

One convention that avoided this brief shorting in the professional audio world was to use the following convention for XLR and PJ-051/WE-310 patch bays, so that, "By making the tip of the jack the low side of the line, the high side is physically protected against momentary shorts when patching in and out of the jackfield.":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woram|first=John M.|date=October 1975|title=The Sync Track|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-DB-Magazine/70s/DB-1975-10.pdf|journal=db Magazine: The Sound Engineering Magazine|volume=9|pages=16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem does not occur when using the 'gauge B' (BPO) phone connector (PO 316)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neutrik.com/en/audio/plugs-and-jacks/mil-b-gauge-type/|title=''Neutrik mil-b-gauge-type plugs''}}&lt;/ref&gt; which although it is of 0.25&amp;nbsp;in (6.3&amp;nbsp;mm) diameter has a smaller tip and a recessed ring so that the ground contact of the socket never touches the tip or ring of the plug. This type was designed for balanced audio use, being the original telephone 'switchboard' connector and is still common in broadcast, telecommunications and many professional audio applications where it is vital that permanent circuits being monitored (bridged) are not interrupted by the insertion or removal of connectors. This same tapered shape used in the 'gauge B' (BPO) plug can be seen also in aviation and military applications on various diameters of jack connector including the PJ-068 and 'bantam' plugs. The more common straight-sided profile used in domestic and commercial applications and discussed in most of this article is known as 'gauge A'.

XLR connectors used in much professional audio equipment mate the ground signal on pin 1 first.

=== Unbalanced audio ===

Phone connectors with three conductors are also commonly used as unbalanced audio ''patch points'' (or ''insert points'', or simply ''inserts''), with the output on many mixers found on the tip (left channel) and the input on the ring (right channel). This is often expressed as "tip send, ring return". Other mixers have unbalanced insert points with "ring send, tip return". One advantage of this system is that the switch contact within the panel socket, originally designed for other purposes, can be used to close the circuit when the patch point is not in use. An advantage of the ''tip send'' patch point is that if it is used as an output only, a 2-conductor mono phone plug correctly grounds the input. In the same fashion, use of a "tip return" insert style allows a mono phone plug to bring an unbalanced signal directly into the circuit, though in this case the output must be robust enough to withstand being grounded. Combining ''send'' and ''return'' functions via single {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in TRS connectors in this way is seen in very many professional and semi-professional audio mixing desks, because it halves the space needed for insert jack fields which would otherwise need two jacks, one for ''send'' and one for ''return''. The tradeoff is that unbalanced signals are more prone to buzz, [[Mains hum|hum]] and outside interference.

In some three-conductor TRS phone inserts, the concept is extended by using specially designed phone jacks that will accept a mono phone plug partly inserted ''to the first click'' and will then connect the tip to the signal path without breaking it. Most standard phone connectors can also be used in this way with varying success, but neither the switch contact nor the tip contact can be relied upon unless the internal contacts have been designed with extra strength for holding the plug tip in place. Even with stronger contacts, an accidental mechanical movement of the inserted plug can interrupt signal within the circuit. For maximum reliability, any usage involving ''first click'' or ''half-click'' positions will instead rewire the plug to short tip and ring together and then insert this modified plug all the way into the jack.

The TRS ''tip return, ring send'' unbalanced insert configuration is mostly found on older mixers. This allowed for the insert jack to serve as a standard-wired mono line input that would bypass the mic preamp. However tip send has become the generally accepted standard for mixer inserts since the early-to-mid 1990s. The TRS ''ring send'' configuration is still found on some compressor sidechain input jacks such as the dbx 166XL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbxpro.com/166XL/166XL.php|title=dbx 166XL compressor with balanced TRS ''tip send'' input and output jacks and one TRS ''ring send'' sidechain jack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some very compact equipment, 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TRS phone connectors are used as patch points.

Some [[sound recording]] devices use a three-conductor phone connector as a mono microphone input, using the tip as the signal path and the ring to connect a standby switch on the microphone.

===Poor connections===

Connectors that are tarnished, or that were not manufactured within tight tolerances, are prone to cause poor connections.&lt;ref name="soundonsound-2005-06"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/q-whats-wrong-my-patchbay|title=Q. What's wrong with my patchbay? -|website=www.soundonsound.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending upon the surface material of the connectors, tarnished ones can be cleaned with a burnishing agent (for solid brass contacts typical) or contact cleaner (for plated contacts).&lt;ref name="soundonsound-2005-06"/&gt;

'''SCRAMSPACE''' was a [[hypersonic]] engine research project established by the [[University of Queensland]], Australia's Centre for Hypersonics. It was a 1.8 meter long, free-flying, hypersonic  [[scramjet]]. A scramjet is fundamentally an [[Airbreathing jet engine|air-breathing]] engine that travels at hypersonic velocities. Built in [[Brisbane]] at an estimated cost of $14 million, it took approximately 3 years to complete.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; SCRAMSPACE was supposed to fire at a hypersonic velocity of [[Mach]] 8 or 8600 km/hour (5343 mph)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hypersonics.mechmining.uq.edu.au/scramspace-fact-sheet|title=SCRAMSPACE Fact sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the flight-test turned out to be a failure and the rocket engine and the [[payload]] plummeted in the North Sea off the coast of Norway. 

== Background ==
SCRAMSPACE was designed and built at Brisbane, Australia. It took 3 years to build and was estimated to cost around $14 million. It was approximated to fly at around Mach 8. It was the first and the largest research project funded by the Australian Space Research Program. A number of ground-based research tests and Mach 8 flight experiments were involved to establish the research project. A number of engineers and PhD scholars were involved in the making of this project.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hypersonics.mechmining.uq.edu.au/scramspace1|title=Centre for Hypersonics, University of Queensland|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ground tests up to Mach 14 were performed to assess the scientific and technical parameters of the project. This was followed by flight tests up to Mach 8.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

The project involved five countries in partnership: Australia, Japan, Germany, Italy and the United States. It was lead by the  University of Queensland's Center for Hypersonics.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

== Aftermouth ==
In August of  2013, the scramjet was airlifted to [[Norway]] for a final flight test at Mach 8. The engine was fabricated to reach an altitude of about 340 km( 211.266 miles) with the help of a [[Two-stage-to-orbit|two- stage rocket]] engine. 

According to the experiment, on leaving the atmosphere, the scramjet had to separate from the rocket engine and re-orient itself for [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]]. The flight -sensor data had to be collected in a three-second window before the scramjet disintegrated on reentry. 

However, because of some unknown issue in the first stage [[rocket]] motor, the scramjet payload could not be delivered to the correct altitude and speed in the flight test conducted on September 18th, 2013&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

The unmanned spacecraft with the payload and the rocket plummeted in the [[North Sea]] off the cost of Norway.&lt;ref name="Failure"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/scramspace-failure/29119/|title=SCRAMSPACE Flight Ends in Failure|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results ==
The final stage of the project did not yield any hypersonic flight data. However, the ground testing, modelling and analysis were able to provide reference results for future projects. The project provided valuable insight and results pertaining to [[Hypersonic speed|hypersonic]] [[physics]], hypersonic [[combustion]]  and also performance of materials and components. It set an example for future [[Hypersonic flight|hypersonic aircraft]] research.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Failure"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The University was established in 1973 and formally began its activities in 1976 following the signature of the permanent headquarters agreement between the United Nations and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/showDetails.aspx?objid=0800000280102344|title=UNTC|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the United Nations University was set in motion by Secretary-General [[U Thant]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES2573XXIV"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-2573(XXIV) |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=24 |resolution_number=2573 |accessdate=2008-05-02|date=13 December 1969|title=International university}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNU Institutes and Vice-Rectorate===
Over the years, several Institutes of UNU were created to help with the research initiatives of the United Nations. Most notably, in 2007, a vice-rectorate was established in Bonn (UNU-ViE), Germany, as a way of strengthening UNU's presence in Europe. UNU-ViE is dedicated to developing knowledge-based sustainable solutions for global problems and is, therefore, an active organizer of international science policy dialogues for sustainability.

===UNU as a degree-granting institution===

In December 2009, the [[UN General Assembly]] amended the UNU Charter to make it possible for UNU to "grant and confer master's degrees and doctorates, diplomas, certificates and other academic distinctions under conditions laid down for that purpose in the statutes by the Council."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unu.edu/about/charter#ART-1|title=UNU Charter|work=unu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, UNU-ISP announced its intention to seek accreditation from the National Institution for Academic Degrees and University Evaluation (NIAD-UE) which is the Japanese accreditation agency for higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isp.unu.edu/about/jobs/2013/programme_administrative_consultant.html|title=Jobs {{!}} UNU Institute for Sustainability and Peace|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=14 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922084737/http://isp.unu.edu/about/jobs/2013/programme_administrative_consultant.html|archivedate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNU-IAS was formally accredited in April 2015, making it the first international organization to be recognized by the NIAD-UE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unu.edu/news/news/unu-ias-accredited-by-the-national-institution-for-academic-degrees-and-university-evaluation-japan.html|title=UNU-IAS Accredited by the National Institution for Academic Degrees and University Evaluation|last=|first=|date=May 1, 2015|website=unu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
The university has several campuses spread over five continents. Its headquarters are located at the UNU Centre in Tokyo, Japan.

==Research ==

The role of the UN University is to generate new knowledge, educate, enhance individual and institutional capacities, and disseminate its useful information to relevant audiences. Within the scope of these five thematic clusters, the UN University undertakes:

*Cross-cultural, interdisciplinary research (utilizing innovative, science-based techniques and methodologies to study important global processes and elaborate forward-looking solutions) and targeted foresight and policy studies (aimed at developing policy-relevant prescriptions and evaluating the feasibility and comparative advantages of each option);
*Postgraduate-level education (degree-oriented programmes and specialized training focused on problems and solutions rather than academic disciplines) and capacity development activities (aimed at helping developing and transitional countries to enhance local potential to address current problems/confront emergent challenges); and
*Knowledge sharing and transfer (to deliver relevant information about UN University research, current scientific advances and best practices, in a timely manner and in a usable form, to those who most need it and can best utilize it).

As prescribed in the United Nations University Strategic Plan 2011–2014, the 26 major topics of focus of the UN University's academic work fall within five interdependent thematic clusters:
#Peace, Security and Human Rights; Peace building and peace keeping, Conflict resolution and human security, Fostering dialogue among civilizations, religions and cultures, Human rights and ethics, Gender equality and mainstreaming,
#Human and Socio-economic Development and Good Governance; Growth and economic development, Alleviating poverty and inequalities, Good governance, Enhancing educational capacities, Fair trade, Processes and consequences of regional integration and cooperation, Leadership, management and entrepreneurship.
#Global Health, Population and Sustainable Livelihoods; Global health, Safe water and sanitation, Food and nutrition for human and social development, Combating HIV/AIDS, Population changes and migration.
#Global Change and Sustainable Development; Climate change — adaptation and mitigation, Ecological health and biodiversity, New risk and vulnerabilities, Sustainable land, agriculture and natural resources management, Green economy.
#Science, Technology, Innovation and Society; Science, technology and innovation, Sustainable energy futures, Sustainable urban futures, Sustainable housing and construction.

Collectively, these thematic clusters define the programme space within which the UN University undertakes its academic activities. Some key perspectives (such as gender equality, human rights and sustainability) pervade all aspects of the UN University's work.

'''Virginia Wesleyan University''' is a comprehensive university of the liberal arts and sciences located in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]], [[United States]]. Founded in 1961 by the Virginia Conference of [[United Methodist Church|The United Methodist Church]], the university enrolls approximately 1,500 students annually in undergraduate, graduate, and online programs. An additional 510 non-credit continuing education students enroll annually through the Robert F. Boyd Institute, the Center for the Study of Religious Freedom, the Center for Sacred Music, and the Westminster/Wesleyan Lifelong Learning Institute. Virginia Wesleyan transitioned from a college to a university in 2017.

The Virginia Wesleyan University campus is also home to the Chesapeake Bay Academy, an educational institution founded in 1989 that educates and guides students with learning disabilities, including attention disorders (ADHD), dyslexia, and dysgraphia, and the Tidewater Collegiate Academy, an innovative laboratory for teaching and learning that extends from the primary grades through high school.

Through academic collaboration with local arts and sciences partners, on-site learning experiences are also provided at the [[Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center]] in Virginia Beach (the university and aquarium jointly own and operate "The Ocean Explorer," a marine science research vessel); The [[Chrysler Museum of Art]] in Norfolk; [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]]; and the [[Norfolk Botanical Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vwu.edu/about-us/accolades.php|title=Accolades|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women as theological figures''' have played a significant role in the development of various [[religions]] and religious [[hierarchy|hierarchies]]. The study of '''[[women and religion]]''' typically examines the role of [[women]] within particular religious faiths, and religious doctrines relating to [[gender]], [[gender roles]], and particular women in [[religious history]]. It is worth noting from  a gender scientific approach, women occupy the second room in all of the following religions in the examples below. 

George H. Gallup Jr. wrote in an analysis for the Gallup Organization in 2002 that, a mountain of evidence shows that women have more religiosity than men. Gallup goes on to say that women hold on to their faith more heartily, work harder for the church, and in general practice with more consistency than men.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Roy Britt, ''Women More Religious Than Men, http://www.livescience.com/7689-women-religious-men.html, February 28, 2009'' October 27, 2014 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bahá'í Faith ==
{{details|Bahá'í Faith and gender equality#Historical women figures in Bahá'í history}}

In Bahá'i writings, the [[Holy Spirit]] is often described as the "[[Maid of Heaven]]".&lt;ref name="Abdo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/abdo_female_holy-spirit |title=Female Representations of the Holy Spirit in Bahá'í and Christian writings and their implications for gender roles |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three women figure prominently in the history of the Bahá'í Faith: [[Táhirih]], a disciple of the [[Báb]]; [[Ásíyih Khánum]], the wife of [[Bahá'u'lláh]]; and [[Bahíyyih Khánum]] the daughter of Bahá'u'lláh. Táhirih and Bahíyyih, in particular, held strong leadership positions and are seen vital to the development of the religion.

Several women played leading roles in the early days of the Bahá'í Faith in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetbahai.org/cgi-bin/articles.pl?article=93 |title=Women in the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Planetbahai.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/mazal_comparison_christianity_bahai&amp;chapter=2 |title=Selected Topics of Comparison in Christianity and the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/finch_unclipping_wings |title=Unclipping the Wings |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are: [[May Maxwell]], [http://bahai-library.com/maneck_women_bahai_faith Corinne True], and [[Martha Root]].  [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] and a mix of male and female [[Hands of the Cause]] formed an interim leadership of the religion for six years prior to the formation of the [[Universal House of Justice]]. Later prominent women include [http://www.bahai.us/node/80 Patricia Locke], [http://www.creativefilms.com/Pos.html Jaqueline Left Hand Bull Delahunt], [[Layli Miller-Muro]], and [http://bahai-library.com/maneck_women_bahai_faith Dr. Susan Maneck], who herself wrote books documenting the role of women in the Bahá'í Faith.

== Jainism ==
The status of women in Jainism differs between the two main sects, [[Digambar]]a and [[Svetambara]]. Jainism prohibits women from appearing naked; because of this, Digambaras, who consider renunciation of clothes essential to [[moksha (Jainism)|moksha]], say that they cannot attain enlightenment in the same life.&lt;ref name="bbcethics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/beliefs/women.shtml |title=Religion &amp; Ethics - Women in Jainism |publisher=BBC |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Svetambaras, who allow [[sadhu]]s to wear clothes, believe that women can attain moksha. There are more Svetambara sadhvis than sadhus and women have always been influential in the Jain religion.&lt;ref name="vam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-jain-faith/ |title=The Role of Women - Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4175">'''World art studies''' is an expression used to define studies in the discipline of [[art history]], which focus on the [[history of art|history of visual arts worldwide]], its methodology, concepts and approach. The expression is also used within the academic curricula as title for specific art history courses and schools.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in [[Norwich]], and the courses at the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

There are several expressions related to World art studies which are often used as interchangeable. Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme, ''World Art Studies''in ''Art History and Visual Studies'' in Europe: Transnational Discourses and National Frameworks, eds. Matthew Rampley, Thierry Lenain, Hubert Locher, Brill, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; provide some more specific definitions as following

* ''World art studies'' is a concept conceived by the art historian [[John Onians]] in the early Nineties as a new field of studies, global and with a multidisciplinary approach.&lt;ref&gt;John Onians, ''World Art Studies and the Need for a New Natural History of Art'' in "Art Bulletin, n. 78, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of World art studies differentiates them from ''world art history'' and ''global art history''. The expression ''World art studies'' was used by John Onians to rename the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]]. The concept of 'World art studies'' is similar to the concept of ''Bildwissenschaft'' or ''image-ology'' is equally multidisciplinary in its approach to analysis of visual images.&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme make reference to the publication edited by Klaus Sachs-Hombach ''Bildwissenschaft: Disziplinen, Themen, Methoden'', Surhkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Global art history'' refers to the study of art in present and recent past with a focus on the art worldwide and interrelated phenomena. This definition relies on the distinction operated by [[Bruce Mazlish]] between ''global history'' and ''world history''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Mazlish, ''An Introduction to Glocal History'' in ''Conceptualizing Global History'', ed. Bruce Mazlish and Ralph Buultjens, Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''World art history'' refers to the study of art of the whole human history. A remark made to this expression is the use of the world ''history'' in singular (history and not histories); the use of the plural is preferred by [[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]], [[Real Spaces|Real Spaces: World Art History and the Rise of Western Modernism]], Phaidon Press, New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]], ''Stories of Art, Routledge, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
