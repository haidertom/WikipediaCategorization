'''Accounting Technicians Ireland''' (formerly IATI) is a professional body for Accounting Technicians on the island of [[Ireland]].  They have over 10,000 members and students in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland.

The organisation was established in 1983 by representatives of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland]] (ICAI) and the Irish Institute of Accounting Technicians (IIAT). Accounting Technicians Ireland was originally called '''The Institute of Accounting Technicians in Ireland'''.

The Accounting Technicians Ireland qualification combines professional exams with practical work experience. The Accounting Technicians Ireland diploma is divided into two parts, each of which is a qualification in its own right:
* Certificate for Accounting Technicians (1 year)
* Diploma for Accounting Technicians (2 years)

As members of the Accounting Technicians Ireland body, individuals are entitled to use the letters MIATI after their name.  After eight years members may be eligible to apply for fellow membership.  Fellow members use the designation FIATI after their name. Other professional accountancy bodies recognise the qualification and offer exemptions from their examination to Accounting Technicians Ireland graduates.

Accounting Technicians Ireland is a not-for-profit organisation.  They are a partner body of Chartered Accountants Ireland and an associate member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC). They have offices in Dublin and Belfast and links with local networks throughout Ireland.

Accounting Technicians Ireland is the trading name for the Institute of Accounting Technicians in Ireland Limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountingtechniciansireland.ie/About_Us/Who_are_Accounting_Technicians_Ireland.html Who are Accounting Technicians Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountingtechniciansireland.ie/About_Us/Mission_values.html Accounting Technicians Ireland Mission and Values]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Air Cargo World cover, first issue.png|thumb|right|The first issue of ''Air Transportation'', whose name was later changed to ''Air Cargo World'', was published in 1942.]]
''Air Transportation'' was founded in [[New York City]] in October 1942 by John F. Budd as the world's first air cargo magazine. The magazine was launched while America was in its tenth month of [[World War II]], and the airfreight industry was in its infancy. A one-year subscription for the United States cost $5.

“''Air Transportation'' is not anti-ship, anti-rail or anti-truck,” Budd wrote in his opening editorial. “It is pro-air, because it believes that, sooner or later, cargo-by-air will be a mighty force with which every shipper should, in his own interest, be familiar.”

The [[United States Department of War]] was relying on aircraft to deliver war supplies, but the long-term future of air cargo as an independent industry was in question.

“Despite the hostility air cargo would have to face after the war, the need for it would lift air cargo into its proper place as a serious and vital form of transportation,” Budd wrote in an early ''Air Transportation'' editorial.

[[Image:Richard Malkin.jpg|thumb|left|Richard Malkin worked as an air cargo journalist for 60 years.He currently at 101  years of age works as contributing editor at Air Cargo News Flying Typers in New York.]]
Richard Malkin, the first full-time air cargo journalist, worked in the field for 60&amp;nbsp;years, writing for what was then ''Air Transportation'' in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Industry in its infancy"&gt;[http://www.aircargoworld.com/Air-Cargo-News/2012/05/an-industry-in-its-infancy/307240 Air Cargo World.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829070729/http://www.aircargoworld.com/Air-Cargo-News/2012/05/an-industry-in-its-infancy/307240 |date=2013-08-29 }} ''An industry in its infancy". May 30, 2012. Retrieved September 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Malkin traveled to [[Frankfurt, Germany]] to write a series of articles about the [[Berlin Airlift]].&lt;ref name="Industry in its infancy" /&gt;

“Passenger people will disagree with me, but almost from the beginning, I recognized air cargo as the more glamorous and romantic side of the business,” Malkin wrote in the 2002 anniversary issue of ''Air Cargo World''. “I spent the next six decades talking about getting out, yet never got around to doing it. Go figure.”&lt;ref name="Industry in its infancy" /&gt;

The magazine eventually changed its name to ''Air Cargo''. In 1983, it became ''Air Cargo World'' and moved its office from New York to metro [[Atlanta]], where it has operated for 30&amp;nbsp;years.

In 2014, ''Air Cargo World'' was acquired &lt;ref name="Royal Media acquires Air Cargo World"&gt;[http://aircargoworld.com/royal-media-acquires-air-cargo-world-10047.]"Royal Media acquires Air Cargo World," September 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://www.royalmedia.com Royal Media Group], a New York-based information company.

==Air Cargo Excellence==
The Air Cargo Excellence awards, known as the ACE Awards, are based on the Air Cargo Excellence Survey, which is carried out and published annually by ''Air Cargo World''.&lt;ref name="Air Cargo Excellence" /&gt; Established in 2005, the survey measures airlines and airports on specific criteria and ranks them to identify above or below average performance.&lt;ref name="Air Cargo Excellence" /&gt;

The survey also shows exactly how airlines and airports are performing against an industry average and specifically highlights areas in need of improvement.&lt;ref name="Air Cargo Excellence" /&gt;

'''Albert Bensimon''' (born 1948) is an [[Egyptian-Australian]] businessman from [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. He is most well known as the owner of [[Shiels Jewellers]]. He frequently appeared in television advertisements and became famous for his catchphrase "No Hoo-Haa".

Bensimon was born in [[Cairo, Egypt]]. His secondary education took place at the [[Christian Brothers College, Rose Bay|Christian Brothers College]] in [[Rose Bay, New South Wales]] followed by a stint at the [[London School of Economics]]. Bensimon is of [[Jewish]] descent.

In 1994, he helped to establish the [[Helpmann Academy]], named in honour of famous South Australian Sir [[Robert Helpmann]]. The academy is designed to promote the arts in South Australia. He was the first chairman and is still a member of its board.

At the [[South Australian state election, 2002|2002 South Australian state election]], Bensimon ran as a "No Hoo-Haa Party" candidate in the [[South Australian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] seat of [[Electoral district of Adelaide|Adelaide]], receiving a primary vote of 2.4 percent (492 votes). His "how-to-vote" ticket indicated a first preference for the [[Liberal Party of Australia]]. Bensimon is also a donor to the Liberal Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2002/02/03/labor-still-a-chance-to-take-the-final-state/|title=Labor still a chance to take the final state|date=3 February 2002|work=Crikey|access-date=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Bensimon was rejected twice for membership of the gentlemen's club, [[The Adelaide Club]], which he claimed was due to [[anti-Semitism]]. This was denied by the Club president, who stated that it was "offensive" to suggest the club was racist and that it has "a diverse membership". In 2008, when another Egyptian-born Jewish businessman was accepted for membership, Bensimon claimed some credit for the move, saying "I broke the back of a small but influential element within the Adelaide Club."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/adelaide-club-move-ends-jewish-tension/story-e6frea83-1111116926408&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/natint/stories/s1583416.htm  |work=National Interest |date=5 March 2006 |title=The Roundup |accessdate=29 June 2006 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfonso Valdés Cobián''' &lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|''' Valdés'''|'''Cobián'''|plain=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (June 23, 1890 - February 14, 1988), was an industrialist, banker, sportsman and politician.  Valdés Cobián was a cofounder of [[Cervecería India]], Inc., currently Puerto Rico's largest beer brewery.

==Early years==
Valdés Cobián was born in [[Bayamon, Puerto Rico]] to Ramon and Encarnación Cobián. When he was a child his family moved to the [[United States]] and lived in [[Manhattan]]. While living there he attended the [[Hamilton institute]], a preparatory school, and [[Columbia University]], where he received a degree in electrical engineering in 1911.

The family returned to Puerto Rico and in 1910, his father, Ramón Valdés founded and organized the "Mayaguez Light, Power and Ice Company", a utility in the city of [[Mayagüez]]. The elder Valdés named Alfonso the company's vice president in 1915.&lt;ref name="GT"&gt;Guía del Turismo en Mayagüez, Clásico de Mayagüez "La Cervecería India", (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; The Government took over all power generation in the late 1930s and the company is now operated by "La Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica de Puerto Rico" (The Puerto Rico Electric Energy Authority).

Mayagüez is known as "La Ciudad de las Aguas Puras" (The City of the Pure Waters) because of the quality of its waters. The nickname originated because of the quality of the waters from the [[Yagüez River]]. The word "Yagüez" is [[Taíno language|Taino]] for "Place of pure and clear waters" .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aalcaldespr.com/mayaguez Mayaguez] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212171359/http://aalcaldespr.com/mayaguez |date=2009-02-12 }}, (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; Valdés Cobián's brother Sabino, took a sample of the waters of Mayagüez to the Wallestein Laboratory in New York which confirmed the quality of the waters for the elaboration of beer.&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt;

Valdés Cobián and his brothers, Sabino and [[Ramón Valdés Cobián|Ramón]] decided to build a brewery in Mayagüez and on November 2, 1937, they founded the [[Compañía Cervecera de Puerto Rico]] which was later renamed Cervecería India. The company competed with two other native beer breweries, "Real" and "Corona" (no relation to the Mexican beer), which no longer exist. Valdés Cobián, as chairman and president, successfully led his company converting it into Puerto Rico's largest beer brewery and manufacture of canned and bottled soft drinks.&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt;

Besides his chairmanship of Cervecería India, Valdés Cobián held the [[Orange Crush]] soft-drink franchise and was president of the Ana Maria Sugar Company and the Insular Feed Mill. For 25 years he was the major stockholder and board chairman of the [[Banco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño (building)|Banco Credito y Ahorro Ponceno]],&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; which at the time was the second largest bank in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primerahora.com/noticia/otras_panorama/noticias/popular_se_agiganta/98500 "Popular se agiganta" - Primera Hora], (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Team owner==

Valdés Cobián was a founder of the Puerto Rican winter baseball league and owned the [[Indios de Mayagüez]] (Mayagüez Indians),&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; the most successful team in the history of the Puerto Rican League.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Indios_de_Mayag%C3%BCez Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; The team was founded in 1938, and once the [[Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League]] (LBPPR in Spanish) was created, the Mayagüez team became a part of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://1800beisbol.com/baseball/Deportes/Beisbol_Puerto_Rico/Historia_Beisbol_de_Puerto_Rico/ Historia Beisbol de Puerto Rico] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316221252/http://www.1800beisbol.com/baseball/Deportes/Beisbol_Puerto_Rico/Historia_Beisbol_de_Puerto_Rico/ |date=2008-03-16 }}, (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; A management team led by Valdés Cobián owned the team during its initial years.

==Politician==
Valdés Cobián was elected in 1917 to the [[Puerto Rico House of Representatives]] representing the district of Mayagüez, position in which he served until 1928. In 1928 he won his first of three terms as a member of the [[Senate of Puerto Rico]], and also became president of the Puerto Rican Republican Party.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==Later years==
In 1960 he was president of the [[Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | title = About Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association  | publisher = Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association  | url = http://www.prma.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=About_PRMA&amp;Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=3035  | accessdate = October 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Valdés Cobián lived in Villa Caparra, a San Juan suburb. On February 8, 1988, Valdés Cobián died in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], after suffering a heart attack two days earlier, at the age of 98. Valdés Cobián was buried in Bayamón's Porta Coeli Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Grace García, whom he married on August 14, 1939, two daughters, Grace Marie, Encarnita Quinlan and a son, Alfonso Jr., and five grandchildren.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; After his death, his wife became the president of brewery until her retirement in 2002, when her granddaughter, [[Camalia Valdés]] assumed the presidency of the company.

==Legacy==
The City of Mayagüez honored his memory by naming the street where the Cervecería India Inc. is located Avenida (Blvd.) Alfonso Valdez.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/product-compint-0001152283-page.html Company profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Alireza Nasiri was born in Iran and finished highschool in the city of [[Qazvin]].[[File:Alireza_Nasiri.jpg|thumb|170x170px|Alireza Nasiri as general director of Educational Support Department for Veteran Students at [[University of Tehran]]. ]]

== Education ==
Nasiri graduated from Iran [[Iran University of Science and Technology|University of Science and Technology]] with a bachelor of Industrial Engineering in 1993 and began his profession as an industrial planner. In the 1990s the Iranian energy and engineering industry was just taking off, having to fill the vacuum left by the exit of companies such as [[Bechtel]] and withdrawal of American blue collar engineers from Iran such as [[Bell Engineering Center|Bell Engineers]] from the times of [[Richard Nixon]], a large need for industrial engineers developed in Iran. Nasiri joined many others who studied at the [[Iran University of Science and Technology|University of Science and Technology]] by completing the [[Iranian University Entrance Exam|Iranian Concours]], the Iranian equivalent of the [[SAT]].

In 2000 he acquired a M.Sc in Executive Management from the Industrial Management Institute (IMI) of Iran in Tehran and started working as an executive manager specializing in industry and engineering. [[File:1st_National_Exhibition_in_IT_and_E-City.jpg|thumb|Launching of 1st National Exhibition on IT in Iran launching E-City plan.|192x192px]]In 2010 he gained a PhD in Management Science and Engineering from the Dalian University of Technology in China and became an academic instructor with extensive experience in management and various industrial planning.

== Career ==
[[File:Online_Degrees_in_Iran.jpg|thumb|239x239px|First workshops held in Iran on the launch and management of online degree programs in University of Tehran.]]Nasiri began his career as an industrial planner in 1993 by working on industrial design projects. Later by 1999 he moved towards consulting and management, using his knowledge of industry and management techniques to improve the internal policy of industrial companies in Iran. He had a full-time career at the [[University of Tehran]] and often consulted companies in various industries and was appointed to several board of directors in those companies. Nasiri was among others part of a push to start a commercial ICT sector in Iran.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090130021742/http://www.austrade.gov.au/ICT-to-Iran/default.aspx]

Since 1998 he worked as acting general manager in the University of Tehran Public Relations office until 1999, working as chief executive of the influential Tehran University Monthly Press (ماهنامه دانشگاه تهران). During that time he was also consultant to the [[chief executive officer]] at Melli National Industrial Shoes Co. and in 2000 became a member of the board at Melli Industrial Shoe. In the same period between 1999 and 2001 he consulted [[Hamid Rahmani]] in [[Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization of Iran|National Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization of Iran]] which is in charge of tourism and export of Iranian cultural products and is regarded as an autonomous [[Politics of Iran|Iranian government ministry]].

In 2002 he shifted departments and his full-time job at University of Tehran changed to the General Director of Educational Support Department for Veteran Students, shortened as Isargaran, in the University of Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shahed.ut.ac.ir/advers.aspx?id=11331 |title=اداره کل امور شاهد و ایثارگر دانشگاه تهران |date=2014-03-14 |accessdate=2017-03-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314114754/http://shahed.ut.ac.ir/advers.aspx?id=11331 |archivedate=2014-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 he launched Iran's first online degree program based out of University of Tehran.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2003 online degree programs were an unexplored subject in Iran and the Middle East, and Nasiri managed workshops on the launch and management of online degrees in Iran at the University of Tehran and the 1st National Exhibition on IT and launched the E-City project.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nasiri|first=Alireza|year=2004|title=Managing Virtual Universities and E-learning Centers, Faculty of Management, University of Tehran Press, Iran, 2004|url=|journal=University of Tehran Press|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he became a member of board at Darya Bandar Shipping Lines Co. In the same year he exited the University of Tehran and started working full-time at the [[Ministry of Cooperatives (Iran)|Ministry of Cooperatives]] as General Director of Planning and Development during the tenure of [[Mohammad Khatami|President Khatami]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While serving as director of planning and development he was the acting vice minister in the absence of [[Bahman Salehi]].

== Commercializing Forestation in Iran ==
[[File:Commercial Forestation in Iran.jpg|thumb|244x244px|Commercial forest planted in Janat Shahr by Aras GED.]]
[[File:Commercial forestation in Iran in an artificial forest managed by Aras GED in Shiraz.jpg|thumb|Commercial forest of Aras GED's genetically modified trees in Shiraz. |221x221px]]
After exiting the [[Ministry of Cooperatives (Iran)|Ministry of Cooperatives]] in 2005 he began a PhD course on Management Science and Engineering in China, Dalian.

After completing his PhD in the city of Dalian he was impressed by Chinese city planning utilizing green spaces as both a decorative and commercial tool to fight pollution and soil damage in the coastal city of [[Dalian]]. He began a campaign to solve Iran's pollution, deforestation and green city planning problem using commercial forestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iranpaulownia.ir/Forest.html|title=ایران پالونیا|website=iranpaulownia.ir|accessdate=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effort would be supported by a series of greenhouses which produced genetically modified trees in a dozen locations across Iran. During this campaign Aras Green Economic Dawn ({{lang-fa|عصر اقتصاد سبز ارس}}), or Aras GED, was established to manage the commercialization of forestation in Iran and cut down on the import of paper into the country which amounted to a billion dollar industry in 2013.&lt;ref name="Paulownia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://marketpublishers.com/report/industry/light_industry/pulp-n-paper_industry_in_iran_business_report.html|title=Pulp-and-paper industry in Iran: Business Report 2017|website=marketpublishers.com|accessdate=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign had many setbacks in areas outside of [[Tehran]], but for the most part has succeeded in making artificial forests commercially viable and profitable for forest owners in Iran. By creating economic value for forests with [[Genetically modified tree|modified trees]] land owners would be part of a countrywide push towards [[Afforestation|commercial forestation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iranpaulownia.ir/Forest2.html|title=ایران پالونیا|website=iranpaulownia.ir|accessdate=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aras GED's commercial afforestation began in several large cities in Iran. Namely [[Tehran]], [[Shiraz]], [[Tabriz]], [[Mashhad|Masshad]], [[Bandar Abbas]], [[Bandar-e Anzali|Anzali]] and [[Ardabil|Ardebil]]. Artificial forests were also planted in less urban locations such as Janat Shahr.

The genetically modified nature of the trees made them both heat and chill resistant which was important in Iran's [[Geography of Iran|diverse weather environment]]. However Aras GED came up with a solution that would solve Iran's forest and pollution problem with a single tree that could be planted in the cold hills of [[Ardabil|Ardebil]] and also the hot valleys of [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province|Sistan and Baluchestan]]. Depending on a variety of factors from the ground's [[red soil]] content to moisture, the Aras GED tree grows anywhere between 2 and 3 meters in the first 7 months of planting.

Using experience gained in the first few years of the commercial forestation campaign in Iran, the company will start to provide a [[Environmentalism|green environment]] [[warranty]] with every Aras GED tree sold across Iran in order to make commercial forestry in Iran more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iranpaulownia.ir/Forest2.html|title=Iran Paulownia|last=|first=|date=|website=Iran Paulownia|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consulting in China ==
[[File:Shiraz Metro Authority and Governor of Fars.jpg|thumb|Shiraz Metro authority and Governor of Fars on a visit to DLRC. |240x240px]]
Nasiri consulted several Iranian companies doing business in China and several Chinese companies doing business in Iran. Among these companies was [[Shiraz Metro]] which purchased rolling stock from [[China Railway Construction Corporation Limited|China National Railway Company]] and its subsidiary in Dalian, [[CNR Dalian|DLRC.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/shiraz-metro-line-1-opens.html|title=Railway Gazette|last=|first=|date=|work=Railway Gazette|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; under an investment and sales agreement with the municipal government of [[Fars Province|Fars]]. Nasiri represented the [[Shiraz Metro]] company in Dalian.

Since 2016 Nasiri's consulting office is based out of the top floor of the SUNIR Co building. SUNIR Co is the 8th global private contractor for electricity transmission and distribution and is based in Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunir.com/About-Sunir/Certificates|title=Sunir - Certificates|website=www.sunir.com|accessdate=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunir.com/About-Sunir/Message-from-Managing-Director|title=Sunir - Message from Managing Director|website=www.sunir.com|accessdate=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of directors==

'''Björgólfur Guðmundsson''' (born 2 January 1941 in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]]) was the chairman and former owner of [[West Ham United FC]]. Björgólfur was Iceland's second businessman worth more than a billion dollars — his son, [[Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson]] being the first. He was at one time the majority owner and chairman of the now nationalised Icelandic bank [[Landsbanki]], the second largest company in Iceland. He was ranked by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine in March 2008 as the 1014th-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $1.1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_The-Worlds-Billionaires_CountryOfCitizen_10.html Forbes' Rich List 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In December of the same year Forbes revalued his net worth to $0&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/banking-budgeting/article/106352/Billionaire-Blowups-of-2008 Billionaire Blowups of 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and on 31 July 2009 he was declared bankrupt by the Icelandic courts with debts of almost £500 million (96 billion [[Icelandic króna|ISK]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/5956509/Icelandic-bank-chief--in-500m-of-hot-water.html Icelandic bank chief in £500m of hot water]&lt;/ref&gt;

Björgólfur is a former footballer, furniture packer and law student, a recovering alcoholic of 30&amp;nbsp;years and an old-fashioned philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/02/newsstory.sport10 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=He's the real thing | first=Jamie | last=Jackson | date=2 September 2007 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s he was sentenced to 12&amp;nbsp;months in prison, suspended for two&amp;nbsp;years, for bookkeeping offences, having faced around 450 charges.&lt;ref name="obsbg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/02/newsstory.sport10|title=He's the real thing|date=2 September 2007|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=2008-09-12 | location=London | first=Jamie | last=Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to [[Russia]], remade his fortune and returned to Iceland, where he also had interests in shipping, publishing, food, communications and property.&lt;ref name="guardbg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/nov/29/sport.comment|title=The real power behind West Ham|date=29 November 2006|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-09-12 | location=London | first=David | last=Conn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and marriage==

Björgólfur's parents were Guðmundur Pétur Ólafsson (1911–79) and Kristín Davíðsdóttir.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visir.is/bjorgolfur-gudmundsson---fra-upphafi-til-enda/article/2009796238314; http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/1499064/&lt;/ref&gt; Björgólfur has an elder brother, Davíð, and three sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Ingi Freyr Vilhjálmsson, ''Hamskiptin: Þegar allt varð falt á Íslandi'' (Reykjavík: Veröld, 2014), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrew Cave 2014 p. 20"&gt;Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; By the account of Björgólfur's son, he was from a working-class background, and his father Guðmundur was affected by a stroke around 1945.&lt;ref name="Andrew Cave 2014 p. 20"/&gt; The young Björgólfur graduated from the [[Commercial College of Iceland]] in 1962,&lt;ref name="atlas.verslo.is"&gt;'Björgólfur Guðmundsson', ''Stúdentafagnaður 2012'', http://atlas.verslo.is/1962?s=nemendur_meira&amp;sid=6168{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; was an organiser of the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] youth wing and is described by Roger Boyes as 'a promising young man, handsome, clean-cut, with reasonable English and a smooth, reassuring manner.'.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Boyes, ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 63-64, 71. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts vary, but it has been claimed that in 1958 Björgólfur was asked by the family of [[Thor Philip Axel Jensen]], Iceland's foremost businessman of the time, to accompany [[Hallgrímur Fr. Hallgrímsson]] to the USA to bring back Hallgrímur's daughter [[Margrét Þóra Hallgrímsson]], who had left her first marriage to [[Haukur Clausen]] to marry the American Nazi [[George Lincoln Rockwell]].&lt;ref name="Roger Boyes 2009 pp. 63-64"&gt;Roger Boyes, ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 63-64; Ingi Freyr Vilhjálmsson, ''Hamskiptin: Þegar allt varð falt á Íslandi'' (Reykjavík: Veröld, 2014), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Björgólfur's son suggests, however, that the two met only after Þóra's return to Iceland following her split with Rockwell.&lt;ref&gt;Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, Björgólfur married Þóra in 1963 and adopted her children by Clausen (Örn Friðrik, b. 1951) and Rockwell (Hallgrímur, b. 1954; Margrét, 1955–89; and Evelyn Bentína).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/286017/&lt;/ref&gt; The couple subsequently had a child of their own, [[Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson]] (b. 1967).&lt;ref name="Roger Boyes 2009 pp. 63-64"/&gt;

From 1962–77, Björgólfur was the founder and director of Dósagerðin hf.; from 1977–86 he was the director of [[Hafskip]], with further responsibilities for its various daughter companies in the Europe and the USA.&lt;ref name="atlas.verslo.is"/&gt; During much of this period, Björgólfur was, in the estimation of his son Björgólfur Thor, 'a highly functional alcoholic', but went into rehab in [[Hazelden Foundation|Hazelden]], Minnesota, 1978 and has not drunk since.&lt;ref&gt;Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—and Back: How I Made, Lost, and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014), pp. 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hafskip affair==

The shipping business [[Hafskip]] was the main competitor to Iceland's established shipping operator [[Eimskip]] (co-founded by the father of Björgólfur's wife). In Roger Boyes's account,

:: initially there was more than enough business for both shipping companies, transporting supplies to the U.S. base. But when an American company started to compete on the route, Hafskip floundered. Björgólfur borrowed to expand, but in the early 1980s—without a bank in his pocket or sophisticated financial instruments available—he struggled to keep the cash flow going. According to Illugi Jökulsson, who has written a book about the Hafskip affair, Björgólfur was suddenly undermined when his bank, Útvegsbankinn, declared his company in default on its loans.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Boyes, ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Björgólfur was prosecuted for bookkeeping irregularities, receiving a twelve-month suspended jail sentence, but in Illugi Jökulsson's interpretation, this

:: was a crude act to dispose of an Eimskip rival (which later took on Hafskip’s ships). More, it was an attempt by the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]] to profit from the downfall of a man who was so clearly aligned with the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Boyes, ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The affair had a considerable effect on Björgólfur and his son, and both at times portrayed their subsequent business activities as a way to take revenge on the people they saw as their persecutors and to regain their reputations.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Boyes, ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 64-66.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the avenues through which Björgólfur worked to restore his reputation in the years following the Hafskip affair was by starting a successful alcoholics' rehabilitation centre in Reykjavík.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Boyes, ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'[https://saa.is/grein/byggdu-vog-redu-thorarin/ Þeir byggðu Vog og réðu Þórarin]' (5 August 15).&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1986–91, Björgólfur was the director and owner of Icestar Ltd. in Copenhagen and a consultant on the shipping business for AMA Agencies in London.

==Beverage businessman in Saint Petersburg==
In 1991, in the wake of the Hafskip affair, Björgólfur began running the brewery and soft drinks unit of Pharmaco, a pharmaceuticals group, in 1991.

In the early 1990s Pharmaco was required to sell off its unneeded bottling machines, and Björgólfur took the opportunity, through a partner, Ingimar Haukur Ingimarsson, who was already based in St Petersburg, to co-found Bravo Brewery with [[Magnús Þorsteinsson]] (chairman of [[Avion Group]]) and Björgólfur's own son Björgólfur Thor. Notwithstanding legal wrangles with Ingimar Haukur, Bravo Brewery became a success.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Björgólfur Guðmundsson and his son later sold the venture to [[Heineken]] for $400&amp;nbsp;million which they invested both in Iceland and abroad.

Danish journalists noted that in [[St. Petersburg]], the ''Committee on External Economic Relations'' in Saint Petersburg's Mayor's office was responsible for foreigners in Saint Petersburg. The committee's chairman was [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref name="vladimir"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsru.com/finance/21oct2008/iceland_print.html |title=Россия желает спасать Исландию из-за давних офшорных связей чиновников и бизнесменов |date=21 October 2008 |publisher=The New Times }}.

The Icelandic businessmen, together with Russian partners, founded the [[bottling company]] Baltic Bottling Plant, which was sold to Pepsi. They moved to brewing and founded the [[brewing company]] Bravo International OOO in August 1996 which became Bravo International JSC in December 1997.&lt;ref name="vladimir"/&gt; Bravo Brewery became a success with the premium beer [[Botchkarov]].

In 2005 an article in The Guardian wondered where the Icelandic money comes from and noted that in the 1990s the three Icelandic businessmen "were not only ploughing money into the country but doing it in the city regarded as the [[Russian mafia]] capital. That investment was being made in the drinks sector, seen by the mafia as the industry of choice."&lt;ref name="vikinginvasion"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/jun/16/marksspencer | title=Next-generation Viking invasion – They've got the cash to buy big UK groups like M&amp;S.

Ilya Weismann, deputy director of competing beverage company ''Baltic'', was assassinated on 10 January 2000. Soon afterwards ''Baltic'' director general Aslanbek Chochiev was also assassinated. One competing St Petersburg brewery burned to the ground.&lt;ref name="vladimir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vikinginvasion"/&gt;

The company became the fastest growing brewery in Russia. [[Heineken]] bought the extraordinarily successful brewery for $400m in 2002&lt;ref name="vladimir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whoisbjorgolfsson"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.invgr.com/bjorgolfur_thor_bjorgolfsson.htm | title=Who is Thor Bjorgolfsson, Iceland's lone billionaire? | publisher=Invest in Greece | date=20 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Björgólfur returned to Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;Ingi Freyr Vilhjálmsson, ''Hamskiptin: Þegar allt varð falt á Íslandi'' (Reykjavík: Veröld, 2014), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The boom years: chairman of Landsbanki==
{{Main|Landsbanki}}
Late in 2002, Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson and Björgólfur Guðmundsson's holding company Samson ehf. gained 45% controlling share of [[Landsbanki]], Iceland's second largest [[bank]], for about 12.3 billion ISK in a controversial privatization.&lt;ref&gt;Guðmundur Magnússon, Thorsararnir: auður – völd – örlög (Reykjavík: Almenna bókafélagið, 2005), p. 354; [http://www.euromoney.com/Article/1002879/Article.html Questions over Landsbanki's new shareholder /Euromoney magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/search/news/Default.asp?ew_0_a_id=136252 IcelandReview - Online, Iceland News, Travel, Vacation, Culture, Hotels, Politics, Business&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The board was announced in February 2003, with the chairman being Björgólfur Guðmundsson.&lt;ref&gt;Guðmundur Magnússon, Thorsararnir: auður – völd – örlög (Reykjavík: Almenna bókafélagið, 2005), p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

Björgólfur became famous and very popular in Iceland during this time as the country's leading philanthropist, both through the direct contributions of himself and his wife Þóra, and through contributions made by Landsbanki (where he started a special service at Landsbanki with the tag "Give help to a good cause"): 'dressed in his trademark pin-striped suits he came to be Iceland’s greatest philanthropist, loved by the public, and was for a while perhaps more influential in the  island’s cultural life than even the Minister of Culture, who in effect was downgraded to second fiddle in many opening ceremonies'.&lt;ref&gt;Eiríkur Bergmann, ''Iceland and the International Financial Crisis: Boom, Bust and Recovery'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly major funding went to the [[National Theatre of Iceland]] for the building of a new stage; the [[Iceland Symphony Orchestra]], which received ISK 25m for touring; the [[Listahátíð í Reykjavík]]; the Icelandic Opera for a staging of ''Tosca''; the Reykjavík [[Menningarnótt]]; the [[Football Association of Iceland]]; [[Grafarvogur|Grafarvogskirkja]]; the [[Icelandic Literary Society]]; the [[University of Iceland]]; [[RÚV]] for domestic programming; the theatre group [[Vesturport]]; the [[University of Akureyri]]; 160 artists in [[Klink og Bank]]; and the artist [[Ólafur Elíasson]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingi Freyr Vilhjálmsson, ''Hamskiptin: Þegar allt varð falt á Íslandi'' (Reykjavík: Veröld, 2014), pp. 51-67; 261-68 (at p. 59).&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly since the 2008 economic crash, however, it has been pointed out that by accident or design this massive patronage of the artistic and intellectual life of Iceland tended to silence critical commentary on the banking boom, helping to cause the collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Ingi Freyr Vilhjálmsson, ''Hamskiptin: Þegar allt varð falt á Íslandi'' (Reykjavík: Veröld, 2014), pp. 67-82, 165-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Björgólfur's use of sponsorship of the cultural sector to win public approval of himself and his businesses extended to buying influence in the media. In 2002, Björgólfur took a 68% in Iceland's biggest publisher, Edda.&lt;ref&gt;Magnús Þór Snæbjörnsson, 'Björgólfskviða- eða listaverkið að lokinni fjöldaframleiðslu sinni: Smásaga með myndum og neðanmálsgreinum', ''Kistan'' (18 October 2008), http://www.kistan.is/Default.asp?Sid_Id=25401&amp;tre_rod=005%7C&amp;tId=2&amp;FRE_ID=78217&amp;Meira=1&lt;/ref&gt; When, in 2005, Guðmund Magnússon published the book ''Thorsararnir'', on the history of the descendants of Thor Jensen.&lt;ref&gt;''Thorsararnir: auður – völd – örlög'' (Reykjavík: Almenna bókafélagið, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In the first version of the book was a chapter on Þóra's marriage with Rockwell. The book was published by the press Edda, but Björgólfur, who owned the publisher, had the author change the text, and had the whole first print run destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://icelandreview.com/news/2005/12/05/chairman-landsbanki-burning-books Chairman of Landsbanki burning books?]', ''Iceland Review'' (December 05, 2005, updated January 30, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he tried to buy the newspaper ''Dagblaðið-Vísir'', which had discussed the matter, in order to close it down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20081116214235/http://www.dv.is/brennidepill/2008/11/1/ritskodari-einokar-dagbladamarkad/ Ritskoðari einokar dagblaðamarkað.] DV, 1. nóvember 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Björgólfur did succeed in buying the country's only broadsheet newspaper, ''[[Morgunblaðið]]'', along with the associated internet news portal ''mbl.is''.&lt;ref&gt;Eiríkur Bergmann, ''Iceland and the International Financial Crisis: Boom, Bust and Recovery'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alda Guðrún Áskelsdóttir, '[https://skemman.is/handle/1946/6145 Áhrif eigenda á íslenska fjölmiðla]' (unpublished MA thesis, University of Iceland, 2009), pp. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The banking crisis, and personal bankruptcy==
Björgólfur's chairmanship at Landsbanki ended when, on 7 October 2008, the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) decided to take over Landsbanki's operations, replacing its board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;'History', https://www.landsbankinn.com/about-us/history/ (accessed 8 September 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; After the almost total collapse of the Icelandic banking system in 2008, Björgólfur Guðmundsson was pointed out as one of the main players behind the Icelandic economic disaster in all Icelandic media including the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service (RUV) and all major newspapers. Björgólfur declared his [[personal bankruptcy]] in 2009, owing $750m, $500m of which he owed to Landsbanki. This seems to have been the world's biggest recorded personal bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Thorvaldur Gylfason, 'Iceland: How Could This Happen?', CESifo Working Paper no. 4605, Category 6: Fiscal Policy, Macroeconomics and Growth (January 2014), p. 9; https://notendur.hi.is/gylfason/cesifo1_wp4605.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, ''Time'' magazine named Björgölfur as one of their hundred most influential people in the world for his role in the Icelandic crash.&lt;ref&gt;Björn Þór Sigbjörnsson, Bergsteinn Sigurðsson, and others, ''Ísland í aldanna rás, 2001-2010: Saga lands og þjóðar ár frá ári'' (Reykjavík: JPV, 2012), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bjorgolfur-Gudmundsson06.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Björgólfur called 75 organisations to his meeting and gave each one 1 million ISK.]]
Björgólfur has been a keen [[association football|football]] fan for years and led the consortium which bought the English [[Premier League]] football club [[West Ham United]]. He bought 90% of the club himself and became the club's Honorary Life President in June 2006, alongside [[Eggert Magnússon]] who became Chairman. In December 2007, Björgólfur bought out Magnusson's residual 5% stake, and took over the chairman's role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_2967356,00.html Magnusson leaves Hammers] SkySports – 13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eggert victim of Hammers' reshuffle"&gt;{{cite news

{{USBankruptcy}}
A '''Proof of claim in bankruptcy''', in [[United States]] [[bankruptcy]] [[law]], is a document filed with the Court so as to register a claim against the [[assets]] of the bankruptcy estate.  The claim sets out the amount that is owed to the creditor as of the date of the bankruptcy filing and, if relevant, any priority status. Although a document called a Claim in Bankruptcy is used in proceedings in both Canada and the United States, in the United States, the document is properly termed a '''Proof of Claim'''. The form is different although they share many similar aspects.

Upon receipt of a claim, the Trustee in bankruptcy must notify the claimant (or creditor) whether the estate will object to the claim or whether it will, as is the default case, allow the claim.  

Some of the reasons a creditor's claim may be objected to are that:

* the claim is not [[liquidated]], such as a claim for damages for pain and suffering that is not the result of a judgment debt. This assertion is not fatal as the claim may be liquidated in Bankruptcy Court;
* the claim omits appropriate set-offs to which the bankrupt entity ("the debtor") is entitled [[by operation of law]];
* the amount of the claim is in dispute, such as a bill for defective goods, in which case the matter may be litigated in Bankruptcy Court;
* the creditor is claiming a higher priority than they are entitled to, such as an ordinary creditor claiming priority to estate assets.

If a claim is objected to, the [[bankruptcy court]] may set a hearing and, if necessary, conduct a trial, in order to resolve the dispute.

There is usually a deadline (termed the '''Bar Date''') for filing claims to allow the trustee to determine the distribution of any funds obtained from the [[liquidation]] of the estate.  Claims are paid out first to administrative creditors, then to priority unsecured creditors according to their statutory priority, and finally to the non-priority unsecured creditors, with all claims paid ''[[wikt:pro rata|pro rata]]'' with other members of the class.

In business dealings, [[Financial transaction|transactions]] often occur that include variables based on future events that can be difficult to ascertain (for example, a company may sell in an amount stock along with a percentage of that company’s net profits.)  As these transactions are contingent on payments that occur in the future, and the total selling price cannot be determined as of the end of the taxable year of the sale, they are known as '''Contingent Payment Sales'''.&lt;ref&gt;See Donaldson, Samuel A., Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, 734 (2nd. Ed. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the uncertainty surrounding the final amounts of these transactions, they are difficult to evaluate for the purpose of tax liability.

== Methods of computing tax liability for contingent sales ==

===Maximum Selling Price===
If the maximum  amount of sales can be determined in the year in which they occur by assuming that all contingencies are met, the price can be calculated in a manner similar to the installment sales method.  If the amount is reduced in subsequent years, than the formula is recomputed accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Treas. Reg §15.A453-1(c)(2)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fixed Period===
If the maximum selling price cannot be determined, but the period over which payments may be received is fixed, then the seller’s basis is recovered ratably over the period during which payment may be received under the contract.&lt;ref&gt;Treas. Reg. §15.A453-1(c)(3)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the agreement neither specifies a stated maximum price nor limits payments to a fixed period, than a question arises as to whether a sale has realistically occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Treas. Reg. §15.A453-1(c)(4)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example in Finance ==

===General Mills Acquisition Case===

====Origin of the Transaction====
Seeking to build growth [[momentum]], [[General Mills]] studied areas of potential growth and value creation in the spring of 1998. This had generated some smaller acquisitions and a general receptivity to acquisition proposals by the firm. In early 2000, the firm’s financial advisers suggested that Diageo might be interested in selling Pillsbury, in an effort to focus Diageo on its beverage business, and that Pillsbury would complement General Mills’ existing businesses.

In March 2000, Diageo’s chief operating officer contacted General Mills’ chairman and CEO to explore a possible sale of Pillsbury. General Mills submitted its proposed deal terms to Diageo in June 2000—the total proposed payment was $10.0 billion. Diageo submitted an [[asking price]] of $10.5 billion. The two sides would budge no further, and it looked as if the negotiations would
founder. General Mills did not want to issue more than one-third of its post-transaction shares to Diageo, and believed that its shares were undervalued in the stock market. Diageo believed it was necessary to value General Mills’ shares at the current trading prices. In an effort to bridge the difference in positions, the two firms agreed upon including in the terms of the deal a '''contingent payment''' on the first anniversary of the transaction that would depend on General Mills’ share price. James Lawrence, chief financial officer of General Mills, said, “We genuinely believe this is a way in which they could have their [[cake]] and we could eat it, too. There’s no question in my mind that, absent this [[Instrumentation (music)|instrument]], we wouldn’t have been able to reach this deal.”

David Van Benschoten, General Mills’ treasurer, added that the contingent payment was another example of the “development of the use of [options] in the past 20 years as finance has come to first understand, and work with, the constructs of optionality.”

It was influential in the development of contract theory and practice in the 50 American states, and throughout the [[common law]] world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7482">'''Costică Canacheu''' (born  October 15, 1958) is a [[Romania]]n politician and businessman. A participant in the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], he has started his political career as a member of the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN), representing its successor, the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] (PD) to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]]. Additionally, Canacheu is an activist supporting the official recognition of [[Aromanians]] as an [[Minorities of Romania|ethnic minority]], being a founding member of the Aromanian Community Association ({{lang-ro|Asociaţia Comunităţii Aromânilor din România}}, ACAR) and the Aromanian Cultural Society (''Societatea Culturală Aromână''; [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]]: ''Sutsata Culturala Armâneascâ'').

== Biography ==

Born to an Aromanian family in [[Budești]], [[Călăraşi County]], Canacheu graduated from the Electro-Energetic High School in [[Bucharest]], and worked as a [[technician]] between 1978 and 1989.&lt;ref name="cvdeputat"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.cdep.ro/pls/parlam/structura.mp?idm=250&amp;cam=2&amp;leg=2004&amp;pag=0&amp;idl=1 Profile at the Chamber of Deputies site]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1993 and 2000, he was head of the Administrative Board for a Bucharest-based private enterprise, SC Neico Grup SA.&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt;

He was an active participant in the Bucharest protests that led to the fall of the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] [[Communist Romania|Communist government]] (December 1989),&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="braileanu22"&gt;{{ro icon}} Răzvan Brăileanu, [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=765&amp;nr=2004-01-28 "Disidenţă, revoluţie, GDS" ("Dissidence, Revolution, GDS"), interview with Radu Filipescu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008065106/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=765&amp;nr=2004-01-28 |date=2007-10-08 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and took part in the establishment of the FSN during February 1990, serving as a member of the FSN-based administration (CFSN, later CPUN) in [[Sector 1 (Bucharest)|Sector 1]] of the capital, and later as a member of the FSN Directory Council.&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt; In the [[Romanian legislative election, 1990|1990 election]], Canacheu won a seat in the [[Parliament of Romania|Constituent Assembly]] for Bucharest.&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt; In this capacity, he notably initiated a legislative project regarding parliamentary control over intelligence agencies (namely, [[Serviciul Român de Informaţii]], SRI) and their archives.&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt;

In the early 1990s, Canacheu was among a group of former revolutionaries who, citing concerns that granting revolutionary certificates and privileges had become an instrument of [[Political corruption|corruption]], formed the [[non-governmental organization]] ''Asociaţia Revoluţionarilor fără Privilegii'' (the Association of Non-Privileged Revolutionaries); other members include [[Ion Caramitru]], [[Dan Pavel]], [[Victor Rebengiuc]], and [[Radu Filipescu]].&lt;ref name="braileanu22" /&gt;

Following the [[September 1991 Mineriad]], he joined [[Petre Roman]]'s FSN faction which became, in 1995, the Democratic Party, and was its Executive Director for Organizing during the [[Romanian legislative election, 1992|1992 legislative election]].&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt; Canacheu was head of the Municipal Electoral Committee in Bucharest (1994-1996), and, in late 1996, headed the campaign in favor of [[Anton Vătăşescu]] for the office of [[Mayor of Bucharest]] (Vătăşescu had received support from ''Uniunea Social-Democrată'', USD, an alliance between the PD and the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1990-2001)|Romanian Social Democratic Party]]).&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt; Between 1997 and 1999, he was a member of the PD's Directory Council, and, from 1999 to 2001, head of the PD's Sector 1 branch.&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt; A member of the PD's Municipal Organization, Canacheu became a member of the party's National Coordinating Council (2000-2002) and the Executive Secretary of its National Permanent Bureau (2002).&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt;

He became a PD deputy for Bucharest following the [[Romanian legislative election, 2000|2000 legislative election]], and won the same seat as part of the [[Justice and Truth]] alliance during the [[Romanian legislative election, 2004|2004 election]].&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt; Serving on the Committee for Defense, Public Order and National Security, of which he was President, Canacheu was also deputy member of the Romanian delegation to the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] of the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt; In late 2006, he proposed changes in Romanian legislation regarding access to [[classified information]], arguing in favor of unrestricted parliamentary access to the latter (amended by the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal]] [[Senate of Romania|senator]] [[Norica Nicolai]], the project was eventually passed).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.bbc.co.uk/Romanian/news/story/2006/11/printable/061130_lege_informatii_clasificate_modificare.shtml "Parlamentarii vor avea acces la informaţii clasificate" ("MPs Will Have Access to Classified Information")], at [[BBC]] Romanian edition, November 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Costică Canacheu supports the view that the 26,500 Aromanians in Romania (of whom approx. 1,300 speak Aromanian as their mother tongue) should be recognized as a separate ethnicity, and has proposed changes in the Law on Minorities.&lt;ref name="diversaromani"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.divers.ro/index.pl/focus_ro?wid=37452&amp;func=viewSubmission&amp;sid=2264 "Aromânii cer din nou recunoaşterea ca minoritate naţională" ("Aromanians Ask Again for Recognition as a National Minority"), in ''Divers'', Spring 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032956/http://www.divers.ro/index.pl/focus_ro?wid=37452&amp;func=viewSubmission&amp;sid=2264 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gatej"&gt;{{ro icon}} Iuliana Gătej, [http://old.cotidianul.ro/aromanii_vor_statut_minoritar-19201.html "Aromânii vor statut minoritar" ("Aromanians Ask for Minority Status")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902041329/http://old.cotidianul.ro/aromanii_vor_statut_minoritar-19201.html |date=2010-09-02 }}, in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', December 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He also called on the [[Romanian Television]] to initiate special broadcasts in Aromanian at a national level.&lt;ref name="diversaromani" /&gt; In autumn 2006, several of the issues he raised were brought to the attention of the [[Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of Culture]], and a review of his proposals was due by September 2006 (in December of the same year, Canacheu announced that no resolution had been passed).&lt;ref name="gatej" /&gt;

[[Image:Gracio.jpg|400px|thumb|Gilberto Grácio and the guitolão]]

'''Gilberto Grácio''' is a famous Portuguese [[guitar maker]], born in Lisbon on 12 May 1936. He is the son of João Pedro Grácio Junior and the grandson of João Pedro Grácio, both renowned luthiers. He started working in his father's workshop at the age of twelve.

The heir of a traditional art of [[Portuguese guitar]] making that has passed through generations of the Grácio family, he will be the last of the Grácio luthiers, since his sons do not want to continue the tradition.

The Grácio family is considered to be one of the most important traditional guitar makers in Europe, and their contribution has helped develop the Portuguese guitar over the years. Their work together with that of the Paredes family reinvented the Lisbon guitar and created the Portuguese guitar of Coimbra.

Gilberto Grácio still works in his workshop in Lisbon, and in the past years he has devoted most of his time to teaching his art.
Two of his students will keep making guitars according to his family's tradition, under his supervision.

Amongst the famous performers and musicians who have bought and played his instruments are [[Carlos Paredes]], [[António Chainho]], Fernando Alvim, and [[Jimmy Page]].

The '''Global Labour University''' (GLU) is an international network of universities, [[trade union]]s, NGOs and the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organisation]]. It was initiated in 2002 and offers [[masters degree|masters]] programs, academic certificate programs and Massive Open Online Courses ([[MOOC]]) on [[sustainable development]], [[social justice]], [[international labour standards]] and trade/labour unions, economic policies and global institutions.

Universities and workers’ organisations from around the world have jointly developed these unique global programmes. The programmes aim at allowing labour organisations and [[social movement]]s to engage more effectively in [[social dialogue]], public debate and policy implementation.

==Project concept==
The GLU is a network of trade unionists, researchers and ILO (International Labour Organisation) experts who have combined their experience and knowledge to further academic expertise relative to the global [[Labour economics|labour market]]. This network develops and delivers high-level academic programmes, usually one year masters  courses. It is a new approach to strengthening the intellectual and strategic capacity of workers’ organisations and to establish much stronger working relationships between trade/labour unions, the ILO, and the scientific community.

The GLU contributes to strengthening union capacity and competence to defend workers' interests, to promote the "Decent Work" agenda and to enable workers’ organisations to engage more effectively in social dialogue on social and economic policy issues such as employment, [[Social Protection|social protection]] and the implementation of international labour standards.

The programs support unions in upgrading their intellectual profile by building a channel for the development of qualified trade union leaders, as well as supporting the recruitment of younger experts. The courses in all countries are conducted in [[English language|English]].

As part of their course, students analyse and discuss, in a multidisciplinary fashion, the challenges of globalisation from a labour and trade/labour union perspective. The programmes offer a multicultural and multiregional environment: students and lecturers come from developing, transition and [[Developed country|industrialised countries]]. Participants may also study one term of the programme in [[South Africa]] or [[Brazil]] and one term in [[Germany]].

The curriculum of a pilot masters course was first developed in 2003/04, the first course starting in Germany in 2004/05, followed by courses in Africa (South Africa 2007) and [[Latin America]] (Brazil 2008), then in mid-2008, in [[Mumbai]], [[India]]. Recently, the Penn State University, USA and the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi joined the network. Discussions have been held with a number of other universities in other countries. Whenever possible, students from all regions will be represented in the courses.

==Governance structure==
The governance structure of the Global Labour University network is based on the partnership between the ILO, the national and [[Labour movement|international trade union movement]], the partner universities and the funding bodies. A steering committee is heading the overall direction.

The Global Labour University is supported by the International Labour Organisation. A limited number of scholarships are available, usually for students from [[Developing country|developing countries]]. The endorsement by a trade union is a requirement for a scholarship. The scholarship is conditional on a contribution of 1500 euros from the student, her/his supporting trade union or another donor.

== Life and work ==
After his studies in computer science in the early 1980s, Eriksson started working in industry in the field of in system development and software architecture. In 1999 Eriksson and Magnus Penker founded Open Training in Sweden, an online learning and e-training institute.&lt;ref&gt;Eriksson &amp; Penker (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; They sold the company in 2004, which continued as Open Training Sweden AB.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=20596058 Open Training Sweden AB], at bloomberg.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s and early 2000s Eriksson authored and co-authored a series of books on business modeling and [[Unified Modeling Language]] in English. His first book in Swedish had been on [[object-oriented programming]] in C++, and was published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Eriksson, Hans-Erik. ''Objekt-orienterad programutveckling med C++.'' [[Studentlitteratur]], 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== ''Business Modeling with UML,'' 2000 ===
In their 2000 "Business modeling with UML" Eriksson and Penker explained that, the main motive for business modelling starts with the every day business: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to keep up and be competitive, all companies and enterprises must assess the quality of their products and the efficiency of their services. In doing so, they must consider what is happening in the world around them, and they must also take an introspective look at their products or services. Is their internal operation working smoothly? Can they improve their product or service? Is their production running as efficiently as possible? Can they expand their product or service portfolios to reach new markets and customers?&lt;ref name="EP 2015"&gt;Hans-Erik Eriksson and Magnus Penker, Open Training."[http://www.utm.mx/~caff/poo2/Business%20Modeling%20with%20UML.pdf Business Modeling with UML]," at ''utm.mx.'' Accessed 04-03-2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And furthermore with the information systems that support everyday business:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to products and services, today's businesses must also evaluate their information systems. Do the information systems effectively support their way of working? Do the systems adapt easily to change? Is information used as an important strategic resource in the business? Is the information adequate and correct? In many of today's businesses, information systems no longer merely support the business. Increasingly, they are becoming an integral part of it. All businesses make some use of information technology, and it is important that their systems are really built to support the businesses of which they are an integrated part. The business is what ultimately defines the requirements on the information systems, and creating software without a proper understanding of the context in which that software is to operate is a dangerous adventure.&lt;ref name="EP 2015"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
Eriksson and Penker claimed that "in order to get such an understanding, it is essential to make a model of the business."&lt;ref name="EP 2015"/&gt;

=== Eriksson-Penker Business Extensions ===
In their 2000 "Business modeling with UML" Eriksson and Penker propose a fundamental domain modeling concept, which became known as the Eriksson-Penker Business Extensions. This [[enterprise modeling]] approach was similar to [[CIMOSA]],&lt;ref&gt;Radovan Cervenka, Ivan Trencansky (2007). ''The Agent Modeling Language - AML.'' p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; This reference model defined four different views of a business: resources, processes, goals, and rules.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto Giunchiglia, James Odell, Gerhard Weiß.''Agent-Oriented Software Engineering III,'' 2003. p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabor Magyar, Gabor Knapp, Jože Zupancic (2007) ''Advances in Information Systems Development.'' 2007. p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The main principles in this approach, according to Grangel (2007), are:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Process: the set of actions that transform input objects into outputs which have an added value for the customer. Processes have a goal and are affected by events.
* Events: a change of state that is caused by a process and is then received by one or more processes.
* Resources: all kinds of things that are used in the enterprise, whether they are either physical or abstract, for example, information.
* Goals: defined for the enterprise and each of its processes; they represent the desired state of each enterprise resource.
* Business rules: define the conditions under which business activity is to be performed and enterprise knowledge should be represented.
* General mechanism: mechanisms to be used in any diagram&lt;ref&gt;Grangel, Reyes, et al. "UML for enterprise modelling: basis for a Model-Driven Approach." Enterprise Interoperability. Springer London, 2007. 91-101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Eriksson-Penker Business Extensions for the UML can be applied for "the analysis and description of enterprise-wide data structures and conversions between them (OMG Common Data Warehouse Metamodel - OMG CWM), and for modelling business workflows (Workflow Management Coalition Metamodel)."&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Estonian Academy of Sciences, Engineering,'' Vol. 8, nr. 1 (March 2002), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

His achievements also include having developed over twenty nine (29) leading art labs in all spheres of the digital arts at Atlantic University College. Among those 29, two new exclusive laboratories for the development of courses in Digital Animation; Programming and Videogame Design.

As a lover of art and technology, Martínez de Dios has served as executive producer of several projects in the past years of his career such as: Super Coqui;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDv5susz1BI Super Coquí (a public service TV commercial) Co-Produced and Published by Heri Martinez de Dios]&lt;/ref&gt; ProtoGojin goes to Atlantic College.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgodpbRw1dk ProtoGojin goes to Atlantic College (TV commercial) Co-Produced and Published by Heri Martinez de Dios]&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently working on a range of collaborative projects: animation, cell phone apps, TV programs, video games, commercials, books and short films, which will be developed under his direction and co-production, drawing on talent from Atlantic University College and the island of Puerto Rico in general. In 2011, as Executive Producer, he launched a commercial titled "The Gladiator in You" that was produced at Atlantic University College without any outside resources.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiaZUrSwbzg El Gladiador en ti (TV commercial) Co-Produced and Published by Heri Martinez de Dios]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other accomplishments include helping to establish the first bachelor's degree courses in Digital Animation and Video Games in Puerto Rico and the first bachelor's degree courses in the Caribbean, in Digital Cinematography Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlanticu.edu/ing/programas_academicos.php Created and established baccalaureate degree courses such as: Digital Animation and Video Games and the first bachelor's degree courses in the Caribbean, in Digital Cinematography Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt; Even more significant is his active contribution to the creation of the only master's degree course in Digital Graphic Design. These four (4) programs, which constituted a historical breakthrough in Puerto Rican education, together with the BA in Digital Graphic Design, running with great success for over a decade, are some of the country's most innovative and unique projects.

Also, in 2014, Martínez de Dios, in collaboration with other resources of [[Atlantic University College]], managed to create the first Master of Science in Interactive Media Programming, first of its kind in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. Likewise for his great contribution to education and entrepreneurship in Puerto Rico, the [[Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association]] awarded the Executive of the Year award in 2014. Similarly, in 2014 AUC won the Gold Cup of cinematography at the Festival "Cinema Campus 2014". In 2015, Martinez de Dios was twice nominated for Emmy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://suncoastchapter.org/awards/2015-emmy-awards/2015-nominations-2/ Martinez de Dios was twice nominated for Emmy Award]&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the categories for which he was nominated was representing, as executive producer, the commercial of Atlantic University College titled El Gladiador en ti 2015. The other three categories in which Martinez de Dios was nominated was representing his own studio Gladius LLC for his short film titled Phoebe &amp; Luna.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16246">An '''industry analyst''' performs primary and secondary market research within an industry such as [[information technology]], consulting or [[insurance]]. Analysts assess sector trends, create segment taxonomies, size markets, prepare forecasts, and develop industry models.  Industry analysts usually work for research and advisory services firms, and some analysts also perform advisory (consulting) services.  Typically, analysts specialize in a single segment or sub-segment, researching the broad development of the market rather than focusing on specific publicly traded companies, equities, investments, or associated financial opportunities as a [[financial analyst]] might.

The IIAR provides this official definition:&lt;ref&gt;http://analystrelations.org/2013/08/27/new-iiar-best-practice-primer-paper-who-are-industry-analysts-and-what-do-they-do/&lt;/ref&gt;

''An information and communications technology (ICT) industry analyst is a person, working individually or within a firm, whose business model incorporates creating and publishing research about, and advising on how, why and where ICT-related products and services can be procured, deployed and used.''

That is not to say that industry analysts do not focus on specific market participants and their product and service portfolios, or that financial analysts ignore industries.  Gideon Gartner, one of the industry analyst business pioneers, was a former financial analyst before launching the Gartner Group in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gartner.com/technology/about.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; But industry analysts do research in the context of a specific sector or market segment, along with the competitive offerings of the other public and non-public companies that comprise the market.  In many industries there is significant overlap between the work product of industry analysts and financial analysts.  The information technology and consulting industries, however, are examples of industries where a significant proportion of important market participants are not publicly traded entities with readily available information and highly regulated disclosure requirements.

Most analyst firms focus on one or more [[market segment]]s, such as [[cloud computing]], [[wireless]] communications, [[audit]] services, or pharmaceutical industry [[safety monitoring]]. Analyst firms and the analysts that work for them are continuously expanding and shifting their coverage areas to keep pace with trends like [[technological convergence]] or [[media convergence]], for example.  This is because demand for industry analyst research services is closely associated with the frequency of change in an industry. So the largest analyst firms tend to have extremely dynamic offerings, and the concentration of service offerings of all market players tends to focus on industry areas that are currently undergoing change.

There are three industry analyst firms that have been in continuous operation since 1970 or earlier. Computer Review is the oldest analyst firm that has been in continuous operation since its inception in 1959, as Adams Associates. International Data Corp has been providing industry analyst and publishing services since 1964, and continues to be operated as a private company by its founder, [[Patrick Joseph McGovern]]. The last of the three, the [[Yankee Group]], was founded by [https://web.archive.org/web/20111106013026/http://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/detail.php?in_spseqno=13173&amp;co_list=F Howard Anderson] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yankeegroup.com/about_us/&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson ran the firm until 1999.

Many industry analyst firms and analysts trace their roots to one of these three firms, particularly IDC, Gartner and the Yankee Group. [http://www.forrester.com/ER/Company/ExecProfiles/Bio/0,,3,00.html] George Colony, for example, was an analyst at the Yankee Group before founding Forrester Research. [http://www.gartner.com/AnalystBiography?authorId=4599 Dale Kutnick] was also a Yankee Group analyst and equity holder before joining Gartner and later founding the Meta Group, which was subsequently purchased by Gartner. Yankee Group was ultimately acquired by 451 Research in 2013.[http://aragonresearch.com/management-team]  Jim Lundy and Mike Anderson were analysts at Gartner before they founded Aragon Research.

==Industry analyst business==
A community of more than 740 analyst firms spans the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://analystrelations.webexone.com/login.asp?loc=&lt;/ref&gt; Research and advisory staffs at these companies range from one person to more than 1,000.

Well-known analyst firms using "traditional" business models include [[451 Research]], [[Gartner]], [[IBISWorld]], [[International Data Corporation]], [[Informa Telecoms &amp; Media]], [[SNL Kagan]], [[Ovum Ltd]], [[Yankee Group]], [[Digital Clarity Group]] and [https://aragonresearch.com Aragon Research].

The "traditional" business model, based on continuous information services (CIS, aka [[Subscription business model | subscriptions]]) where analysts author reports that are then sold to many clients is under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;http://analystrelations.org/2011/10/12/thoughts-on-the-analyst-business-and-music-industry-business-models/&lt;/ref&gt; Several firms are designing new analyst [[business model]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=188100576&lt;/ref&gt; based on contemporary technologies, [[open-source]] licensing concepts, emerging markets, loosely federated analysts, and/or a more radical and visible emphasis on [[offshoring]].  Notable examples of analyst firms developing models based on [[social media]] such as Canada's ConneKted Minds and "open research and analysis" include [[RedMonk]],&lt;ref&gt;

Singapore-based Springboard Research (now owned by Forrester) exemplifies progressive use of offshoring research and Experton and Experture exemplify loose federations of independent analysts. capioIT exemplifies firms which focus on emerging geographic and technology markets.

==Roles and deliverables==
Industry analysts provide a combination of syndicated and client-sponsored (bespoke) [[market research]], [[competitive intelligence]], and [[management consulting]] services.

Deliverables take many forms that can be grouped as follows:
* publications like research reports, white papers, research notes, and newsletters
* advisory services that include inquiries, briefings, consulting projects, study findings presentations or bespoke speaking engagements (for instance at internal client meetings or industry events)
* events such as conferences, seminars, roundtables
* market analysis, such as quantitative market trends, forecasts and market shares.

Analyst firms serve a management decision support function at corporations and public service organisations and for the vendors, regulators and investors serving those industries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cio.com/article/32163/IT_Advisory_Services_Bad_News_for_Analysts_Good_News_for_CIOs/1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/documents/areas/fac/isrp/wp-3-02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry analysts serving buyers of technology-based products and services, where the largest concentration of industry analysts provide services, work with three primary groups of clients:	
* Commercial and public service entities that use technology-based products and services.
* Vendors providing products and services to commercial and public service organizations, and the channel intermediaries that resell or aggregate these products and services, including hardware manufacturers, communications companies, software firms, IT services providers, [[value-added reseller]]s, mobile network operators, and content aggregators.
* Organizations that invest-in, regulate, or support the vendors and intermediaries, including investment banks, anti-trust regulators, chambers of commerce, and leasing companies.

The subjects of research conducted by analysts include many of the same stakeholders that also buy services from analysts. This has caused the integrity of the research to be questioned, which is covered in more detail below. These research subjects include product and service buyers, users, and implementers; the product and service providers themselves, including their key supply chain partners; and sources of investment capital for the vendors, capital for client purchases of vendor products and services, and regulators. Analysts also perform at least passive sales support for their firms, such as contributing to sales meetings, contracts, project profitability, or lead generation programs. This is necessary because the clients are paying for their expertise and must have an opportunity to assess associated capabilities.

At most firms, analysts set research agendas in close cooperation with clients, design surveys, analyse findings, and write research. They may also conduct the surveys themselves, or they may work with third parties or interns to perform the data collection. Increasingly, analyst firms and their subcontractors employ online survey tools and offshoring to reduce research costs and turnaround time.  In some cases, analyst firms are mining new sources of information from research partners, like consumer cell phone bills, RFID-enabled point of sale data, and analytics on Web traffic.

Typically, technology and service providers work to influence the analyst research agenda and coverage of their firm, and to build trusted relationships with individual analysts.  This is done through a specialized marketing function called industry analyst relations or [[analyst relations]], where some analyst relations staff members specialize themselves in certain product, service, industry, or geographic areas of the vendor organization.  This function not only facilitates effective two-way communications between the analyst firm and the vendor, it attempts to concentrate and control spending on industry analyst research and advisory services.

It has become a common practice for analyst firms to assign a central "vendor relations" contact within their organization, to coordinate briefing, reprint and similar requests from vendors. Commercial and public sector client organizations have now assigned sourcing and procurement category managers as the primary contact for research and advisory services firms as well, to concentrate and better leverage spending on related products and services.

==Skills==
Companies participating in the industry analyst profession have not adopted universal standards for employee education, skills, or professional conduct. Some firms adhere to standards set by competitive intelligence, market research or other professional associations. Overall, this situation results in competitive differentiation among analyst firms.

Most analyst firms require above-average written and oral communication skills.

==Integrity and transparency issues==
Analyst objectivity and accuracy is an issue that is frequently debated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationweek.com/shared/printableArticle.jhtml?articleID=178601879&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/12/12/analyst_nytimes/&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the criticism appears to focus on the business relationships between analysts and the technology providers that are the subjects of their research.  In short, analyst firms often rely heavily on revenues from the technology providers they cover (e.g., Darwin magazine, March 2001).

This source of revenue is a significant component of the business models of most analyst firms. Individual analysts and teams conduct research on industry segments where a vendor may provide products or services, and that same individual or group may provide research deliverables or advisory services to a vendor serving that segment. The analyst is then expected to provide independent objective advice to buyers of those products and services.  This matrix of relationships presents opportunities where conflicts can arise.  This is exacerbated by the training many vendor analyst relations professionals receive, where they are advised to focus spending on analysts that have the most ability to influence purchases of goods and services by clients, and to bypass controls analyst firms may have in place to preserve that objectivity by limiting direct access to certain analysts for non-research purposes.

There is also the issue of analyst firms signing boilerplate confidentiality agreements with vendor firms. This occurs when licensing research or performing advisory work, or when conducting detailed briefings in advance of announcements. The language in those agreements often limits the disclosure of certain information that may be disclosed to analysts in the normal course of their research, limiting their ability to fully disclose research findings to buyers of any research deliverable. Some research organizations now refuse to sign confidentiality agreements with vendors or service providers. But there may be a legacy of agreements in place that perpetually limit disclosure for some large vendor clients, so some of the smaller firms have limited work with vendors.

Burton Research, for example, enforces a cap of 20% of revenues to be derived from product vendors or service providers.  Burton is now owned by Gartner, and continues to limit its vendor expenditures. [[Real Story Group]] is a small boutique firm that performs research on products and publishes evaluations.  It works solely for buyers and refuses to accept business from vendors that are subjects of its evaluations.  Despite a few exceptions, buy side industry analysts represent a small minority of analyst firms today. Even research firms whose services are tailored specifically to the interests of product and service buyers often derive some proportion of their revenues from vendors and service providers, since that information is important to them as well.

Another side to this debate is that analyst firms create hype and influence markets in several ways&lt;ref&gt;http://analystrelations.org/2012/09/26/guest-post-why-it-vendors-should-take-industry-analysts-more-seriously/&lt;/ref&gt; or at even influence deals directly when speaking to end-user buyers.

The debate over objectivity and independence has always been an active one, with some firms using independence (in absolute and relative terms) as a source of strategic differentiation.  Other factors that affect research integrity include transparency with regard to research [[methodology]] and [[survey sampling]], theoretical or shallow vs. in-depth or hands-on expertise of analysts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/761/analyst4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612072757/http://www.informationweek.com/761/analyst4.htm |archivedate=2011-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasis on qualitative over quantitative research, and the overall efficacy of a firm's research offerings toward the goal of improving the quality of business and technology decisions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zdbln/is_200212/ai_ziff34905/print&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crmbuyer.com/rsstory/56053.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International arbitration''' is [[arbitration]] between companies or individuals in different [[Sovereign state|states]], usually by including a provision for future disputes in a contract.&lt;ref&gt;Gary B. Born, International Commercial Arbitration, 187, 197, 217 (2009); Julian M. Lew, Loukas A. Mistelis &amp; Stefan M. Kröll, Comparative International Commercial Arbitration 1-10 to 1-11, 6-1 to 6-6 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant system of rules is the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, as well as the  [[United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards]] of 1958 (the "New York Convention").&lt;ref&gt;Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958 (the “New York Convention”), June 10, 1958, http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/NYConvention.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID) also handles arbitration, but it is particularly focused on [[investor-state dispute settlement]] and hears relatively few cases.

The New York Convention was drafted under the auspices of the United Nations and has been ratified by more than 150 countries, including most major countries involved in significant international trade and economic transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Fry, Recognition And Enforcement Of Foreign Arbitral Awards: A Global Commentary On The New York Convention Foreword (Herbert Kronke, Patricia Nacimiento, Dirk Otto &amp; Nicola Christine Port eds., 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Convention requires the states that have ratified it to recognize and enforce international arbitration agreements and foreign arbitral awards issued in other contracting states, subject to certain limited exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;New York Convention, arts. II, III &amp; V, June 10, 1958, http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/NYConvention.html; Fouchard Gaillard Goldman On International Commercial Arbitration ¶¶ 250-252 (Emmanuel Gaillard &amp; John Savage eds., 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; These provisions of the New York Convention, together with the large number of contracting states, have created an international legal regime that significantly favors the enforcement of international arbitration agreements and awards.&lt;ref&gt;Gary B. Born, International Arbitration and Forum Selection Agreements: Drafting and Enforcing 10-11, 123-124 (3rd ed. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; It was preceded by the 1927 [[Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards]] in Geneva.

== Features ==
International arbitration allows the parties to avoid local court procedures. International arbitration has different rules than domestic arbitration,&lt;ref&gt;Yves Dezalay &amp; Bryant G. Garth, Dealing In Virtue: International Commercial Arbitration And The Construction Of A Transnational Legal Order 9-10, 124, 198 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and has its own non-country-specific standards of ethical conduct.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibanet.org/images/downloads/guidelines%20text.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  

The process may be more limited than typical litigation and forms a hybrid between the common law and civil law legal systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sachs|first=Klaus|title=CMS Guide to Arbitration: Foreword|url=http://eguides.cmslegal.com/arbitration#|publisher=CMS Legal|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[International Bar Association]] (IBA)'s Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial Arbitration, revised in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibanet.org/images/downloads/IBA%20rules%20on%20the%20taking%20of%20Evidence.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; do not  adopt common law broad disclosure procedures (discovery) or follow the civil law in eliminating entirely the ability of engaging in some disclosure-related practices. The IBA Rules blend common and civil systems so that parties may narrowly tailor disclosure to the agreement's particular subject matter. 

David Rivkin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debevoise.com/attorneys/detail.aspx?id=51f057f6-8110-4477-a41b-59e72f9138b5]&lt;/ref&gt; who chaired the committee that drafted the rules, has noted that the wide adoption of these rules in international arbitration has led in practice to an unexpected use by common law practitioners to limit disclosure and by civil law practitioners to expand it. 

The rules can be further impacted by [http://eguides.cmslegal.com/arbitrationreferences arbitral rules] that may be agreed between the parties.

=== Global enforcement ===
Most countries, especially in the developed world, are signatories of the New York Convention. Consequently, judgements can be enforced across the world. The New York Convention, more formally known as the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, provides for court recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitration decisions, allowing arbitration proceedings to piggyback on the authority of domestic jurisdictions across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Druzin|first=Bryan|title=Anarchy, Order, and Trade: A structuralist Account of why a global Commercial Legal Order is emerging|url=https://works.bepress.com/bryan_druzin/12/|journal=Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law|volume=47|page=1057}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast, there is no equivalent treaty for the international recognition of court decisions with a large membership although the [[Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements]] entered into force in 2015 for the European Union and Mexico. Similarly, no equivalent treaty exists so far for the international recognition of settlements achieved in [[mediation]] or [[conciliation]]:so far, a meeting of the [[UNCITRAL]] Working Group II in New York has taken place in February 2015 subsequent to a US proposal for that working group to develop a convention on the enforcement of conciliated settlement agreements for international commercial disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Lorraine Brennan: [http://www.mediate.com/articles/BrennanLbl20150227.cfm Do We Need a New York Convention for Mediation/Conciliation?], Mediate.com, February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Within the EU, the enforceability of mediation agreements is ruled by Directive 2008/52/EC.

=== Protection from lawsuits ===
Under the New York Convention, if a party to arbitration files a lawsuit in breach of an arbitration agreement, the court is obligated to stay the proceedings. Chapter 2 of the [[Federal Arbitration Act]] sets forth the statutory basis for an American court to issue a stay in connection with contracts falling within the ambit of the New York Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Arbitration in New York|url=http://eguides.cmslegal.com/pdf/arbitration_volume_I/CMS%20GtA_Vol%20I_NEW%20YORK.pdf|publisher=CMS Legal|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But it is important to adopt one organization related to arbitration.

=== Appeals ===
Under the New York Convention, Article V provides for seven reasons that a court can use to refuse to enforce an arbitration judgment .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/bjil/vol3/iss2/2/|title="Enforcement of Arbitral Awards under the New York Convention - Practic" by Joseph T. McLaughlin and Laurie Genevro|website=scholarship.law.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cases and statistics ==
Public information on overall and specific arbitration cases is quite limited as there is no need to involve the courts at all unless there is a dispute, and in most cases the loser pays voluntarily.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Argen|first=Robert|date=2015-01-01|title=Ending Blind Spot Justice: Broadening the Transparency Trend in International Arbitration|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network|ssrn=2393188}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, a review of disputed cases in China found that from 2000 to 2011, in 17 cases the Supreme People's Court upheld the refusal to enforce the arbitration agreement due to a provision in Article V; China has an automatic appeal system to the highest court, so this includes all such refusals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/ab/vol1/iss1/10/|title="Implementation of the New York Convention in China" by Xiaohong Xia|website=digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agreement details==

A number of essential elements should be included in almost all international arbitration agreements, with model language available.&lt;ref&gt;IBA Guidelines for Drafting International Arbitration Clauses, http://www.ibanet.org/LPD/Dispute_Resolution_Section/Arbitration/Default.aspx; Gary B. Born, International Arbitration And Forum Selection Agreements: Drafting And Enforcing (3d ed. 2010); Paul D. Friedland, Arbitration Clauses For International Contracts (2nd ed. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; These include the agreement to arbitrate, a definition of the scope of disputes subject to arbitration, the means for selecting the arbitrator(s), a choice of the arbitral seat, and the adoption of institutional or ad hoc arbitration rules.&lt;ref&gt;G. Born, International Arbitration And Forum Selection Agreements: Drafting And Enforcing 38 (3d ed. 2010); Paul D. Friedland, Clauses For International Contracts 61-69 (2nd ed. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of other provisions can also be included in international arbitration clauses, including the language for the conduct of the arbitration, choice of applicable law, arbitrator qualifications, interim relief, costs, and procedural matters.

In order to bridge the gap when parties to an international agreement have difficulty in agreeing upon an arbitral institution, some international arbitration specialists recommend using an arbitration clause that authorizes two arbitral institutions in the same city. Those clauses generally empower the party ''commencing'' the arbitration to select the arbitral institution.&lt;ref&gt;See Eric Sherby, “''A Different Type of International Arbitration Clause'',” ''Int’l Law News'' (American Bar Association) Winter 2005 at 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mnemonic device, “BLINC LLC”,  reflects some of the most important clauses: broad, law, institutional, number, costs, location, language, and carve-out.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.abanet.org/buslaw/blt/content/articles/2010/09/0001.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Important Institutions for Arbitration in North America are [http://www.jamsinternational.com/ JAMS International], the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre (BCICAC, Canada).

Specialist ADR bodies also exist, such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), which has an arbitration and mediation center and a panel of international neutrals specialising in intellectual property and technology related disputes. [http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/] 

A number of arbitral institutions have adopted the UNCITRAL Rules for use in international cases. See for example, Australia's adoption of the UNCITRAL Rules in its 6 July 2010 amendment to the 'International Arbitration Act 1974' (Cth).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AUIntLawJl/2012/10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaa1974276/&lt;/ref&gt;

The most salient feature of the rules of the ICC is its use of the "terms of reference." The "terms of reference" is a summary of the claims and issues in dispute and the particulars of the procedure and is prepared by the tribunal and signed by the parties near the beginning of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barin |first1=Babak |last2=Little|first2=Andrew |last3=Pepper|first3=Randy  |date=2006 |title=The Osler Guide to Commercial Arbitration in Canada |url= |location=The Netherlands |publisher=Kluwer Law International |page=34 |isbn=90-411-2428-4 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more recent development, the Swiss Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Basel, Berne, Geneva, Lausanne, Lugano, Neuchâtel and Zurich have adopted a new set of Swiss Rules of Commercial Mediation that are designed to integrate fully with the Swiss Rules of International Arbitration that were previously adopted by these chambers to harmonize international arbitration and mediation proceedings across Switzerland.[http://www.altenburger.ch/uploads/tx_altenburger/jl_2008_Swiss_Rules_Commercial_Mediation.pdf]

== Research and other organizations ==
The International Arbitration Institute, headed by [[Emmanuel Gaillard]], was created in 2001, under the auspices of the Comité français de l’arbitrage (CFA), to promote exchanges and transparency in the international commercial arbitration community.

The Association for International Arbitration is a non-profit organisation founded in Paris in 2001 by Johan Billiet which provides information, training and educational activities but does not appoint arbitrators.

== International investment and ICSID ==
{{Main article|International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes }}

The [[International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID) is an ad hoc tribunal established pursuant to UNCITRAL Rules to arbitrate [[International Investment Agreement]]s and provide foreign investors with a means for redress against states for breaches of contract. The ICSID was designed so that it cannot be reviewed by domestic courts which in theory makes it more enforceable.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8774773/State_Immunity_from_Execution_in_the_Collection_of_Awards_Rendered_in_International_Investment_Arbitration_the_Achilles_Heel_of_the_Investor_State_Arbitration_System|title=State Immunity from Execution in the Collection of Awards Rendered in International Investment Arbitration: the Achilles’ Heel of the Investor – State Arbitration System?|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, state immunity to lawsuits and judgments poses a barrier to collection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The legal protection of [[Foreign Direct Investment|foreign direct investment]] is guaranteed by a network of more than 2750 [[Bilateral Investment Treaty|Bilateral Investment Treaties]] (BITs), Multilateral Investment Treaties, most notably the [[Energy Charter Treaty]] and a number of free trade agreements containing chapter on investment protection through [[investor-state dispute settlement]], such as [[NAFTA]]. The overall number of cases concluded reached 244. Of them, approximately 42% were decided in favour of the state and approximately 31% in favour of the investor. Approximately 27% of the cases were settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/webdiaepcb2013d3_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interstate arbitration ==

Arbitration has been used for centuries, including in antiquity, for the resolution of disputes between states and state-like entities.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson H. Ralston, International Arbitration From Athens To Locarno 153-154; John L. Simpson &amp; Hazel Fox, International Arbitration:  Law And Practice 1 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of relative disuse, [[Jay's Treaty]] between the United States and Great Britain revived international arbitration as a means of resolving interstate disputes. The 1899 and 1907 Hague Conferences addressed arbitration as a mechanism for resolving state-to-state disputes, leading to the adoption of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes]].  The Conventions established the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] and a rudimentary institutional framework for international arbitration of interstate disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Shabtai Rosenne, The Hague Peace Conferences Of 1899 And 1907 and International Arbitration: Reports and Documents xxi (2001); Alan Redfern, Martin H. Hunter, Nigel Blackaby &amp; Constantine Partasides, Redfern And Hunter On International Arbitration 1.197 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, international arbitration has been used to resolve a number of disputes between states or state-like entities, including Eritrea v. Yemen,&lt;ref&gt;Eritrea v. Yemen (Perm. Ct. Arb. 1999), {{cite web |url=http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=1160 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412132024/http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=1160 |archivedate=2015-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Abyei Arbitration,&lt;ref&gt;Abyei Arbitration (The Government of Sudan v.

'''John Clarence Drinkle''' (born 1878 in [[Waverley, Ontario]]) was one of [[Saskatoon]]’s foremost boomtown entrepreneurs.  He arrived in 1903 at age 25 with less than $500 and quickly made himself possibly the richest man in town.

==Early years==
John Clarence Drinkle was born in Waverly, Ontario in 1878 where he received his early business training as a retail clerk.  He moved to [[Winnipeg]] in 1898, where a disastrous business venture early in his career drained his capital and left him in debt.  From 1901 to 1903 he worked as a salesman for Salada Tea Company to pay off his debts.  At age 25 he teamed up with F.E. Kerr, a business school friend, and with a combined total capital of $500 they set off for Saskatoon, [[Saskatchewan]] to set up a real estate office.

During Saskatoon’s first boom period everyone was speculating in real estate.  The relatively poor were often made wealthy in a very short time - Drinkle may have been the most extreme example.  He arrived in 1903 at age 25 with less than $500, when Saskatoon was a dirt street town of barely 500 people.  Only ten years later it had a population of 28,000 and was described as "the fastest growing city in the world".  By then Drinkle was a multi-millionaire and probably the richest man in town.

Drinkle was married twice during his early Saskatoon years, then was married again in the 1940s.  He is said to have spent so much time on business that he had limited time for family. One marriage reportedly ended with his wife returning home to New York after having had an affair with Drinkle’s chauffeur.  Beginning in 1911 Drinkle and his wife, Jane Godden, lived primarily in London, England where they had four children.  They travelled extensively, steaming around the world three times, and were reported to have lived in a very high style. It was during this time that Drinkle began selling many of his Saskatoon properties, including his mansion on Avenue A in 1912.

==Firsts==
Drinkle loved technology and was one of Saskatoon’s most innovative early leaders.  He installed Saskatoon’s first automatic telephone system in 1907, one of the first on the continent. He started Saskatoon’s first modern steam laundry, and oversaw the "largest and finest furniture store West of Winnipeg". Drinkle has been credited with bringing the first car to Saskatoon, which he used to show real estate to prospective clients.  He built the "first substantial business block fit for a large metropolis",&lt;ref&gt;Don Kerr and Stan Hanson, Saskatoon: The First Half Century, NeWest Press c.1982&lt;/ref&gt; complete with the first elevator, and built for himself a modern house described as "one of the most beautiful homes in the entire province".&lt;ref&gt;Norman Fergus Black, The History of Saskatchewan and the Old North West (Regina: north West Historical Company, ca. 1913), p424-428.&lt;/ref&gt;  His company was one of the first to buy vast tracts of land on speculation for resale to farmers, and this was the early base of his fortune.

==Drinkle No. 1==
Drinkle startled the community in 1906 when he commenced the erection of the first large brick office building in town.  Saskatoon’s architecture at the time was humble, but Drinkle’s design was worthy of a large metropolis. It was designed by [[Walter William LaChance|W.W. LaChance]], Saskatoon’s first resident architect.

The building was completed in 1909, and was located on the Southwest corner of 2nd Avenue and 21st Street, which was the former site of his Great West Furniture Store. The four-storey concrete and brick structure had Saskatoon’s first lift elevator.  It was called the "mercantile mansion" and the "grandest building West of Winnipeg:.  Drinkle moved his furniture store into the building as its first tenant, occupying {{convert|40000|sqft|m2}}. The top floor was used as the first home for the University of Saskatchewan for two years, before the campus was built.  Students boasted that theirs was the only university in Canada with a lift elevator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| vauthors =| title =Documenting Saskatchewan - J C Drinkle Building| work =| publisher =[[University of Saskatchewan]]| year =1997| url =http://library2.usask.ca/90th/1900/1909.html| doi =| accessdate =2009-02-23}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drinkle No. 1 was consumed by fire on January 24, 1925.  It housed MacMillan Department Store at the time. The janitor, Thomas Simmons, nearly lost his life making a heroic effort to rescue his wife who perished in the blaze.  He was rescued by fire chief John Faithfull after falling unconscious from the fumes.  Two days later the last flames were extinguished, but the search for his wife’s body could not be resumed until the remaining walls were knocked down.

== Drinkle No. 2 ==
Completed in July, 1913, at the end of the boom period, Drinkle No. 2 was designed by Robert S. Byers and constructed by Frid-Lewis Contractors at a reported cost of $60,000.  Over the years it housed many street level stores including: Colliers Music, Brown’s Delicatessen, Sherwin Williams, Meedwill Radio, National Cash Register, and The Crown and Anchor bar.  Drinkle No. 2 caught fire on the night of May 19, 1986.  When the fire department arrived flames were already coming through the roof and windows.  Unable to get inside, the firefighters were limited to using equipment to prevent the fire from spreading to either the Saskatoon Credit Union or the Ross Block next to it to the south.  No one was injured in the fire, but the businesses that occupied it lost their stock and were forced to relocate.

==Drinkle No. 3==
[[File:City of Saskatoon - Drinkle No 3 Building - October 2009.jpg|thumb|Drinkle No. 3 building at night.]]
Known as Regent Plaza since 1976, Drinkle No. 3 was Drinkle’s most ambitious project.  When the boom was in full stride, all eyes were on 3rd Avenue.  The street was described as the site of "probably the greatest development ever seen at one time on any street in Canada". The city founders envisioned 3rd Avenue as Saskatoon’s greatest metropolitan street.  Drinkle envisioned this building, then named Drinkle No. 3, as his greatest achievement and the tallest, finest building in the city. Ultimately, both visions were only half fulfilled. It was designed as a fireproof five story steel-reinforced concrete and brick office building, complete with high speed elevators and marble corridors trimmed with quarter-cut oak. In 1913, after five floors had been built, Drinkle announced his intention to add an additional five floors, making it the tallest building in Saskatoon. Its architects intended the façade of the top two floors to be treated with decorative terra cotta to draw one’s eye to the grand cornice. Drinkle planned a rooftop garden similar to one he had admired in a Vancouver building. The projected cost of the ten story structure was $450,000.  The construction of the additional five floors was delayed in the winter of 1913, reportedly due to a shortage of steel.  The onset of "the bust" eventually put a stop to construction and the remaining five floors, cornice, decorative terra cotta, and the marble lined corridors were never built. The building was never used for offices and was converted to residential use in 1919.

In 1923 Drinkle 3 was expanded to approximately 100 suites, and then was remodeled in the 1980s to have 60.  Commercial tenants through the years have included Buckwold’s, General Motors, Firestone, Gassy Jax, The Gazebo, Custom Stereo, Macho, The Partnership, Lucci’s, Sardi’s, Muffin Break, Lee’s Vietnamese, Tarragon, and The Publican.  In 1977 the building nearly burned when a fire at Gassy Jax caused $400,000 damage, killing palms and canaries housed in the store.

==Legacy==
Drinkle continued at least two entrepreneurial endeavors in Saskatoon in the years after the bust, but neither were successful.  Perhaps his temperament was ill-suited for the post-war business and political climate, which was so different from the exuberance of the boom years.  Although Drinkle lost his Saskatoon assets to receivership, he seems to have preserved some of his wealth, possibly due to his having liquidated many of his properties starting two years before the bust. He is reported to have lived in an extravagant lifestyle in London for ten years after the bust. It is unclear what his activities in London were during that time, but in 1920 he and his family returned to Saskatoon broke and ready to start over. He took over the Saskatoon Pure Milk Company, with the support of his brother William, and adapted its operation to conform with new pasteurization regulations.  However, this business went into receivership in 1926, and led to a falling out with his brother.  It appears that Drinkle left Saskatoon not long after and did not return until about 1939 when he established the Drinkle Canning and Preserving Company at 215 22nd St W, near the site of his original laundry.  This company operated in relative obscurity until the early 1940s when he married his third wife, Loretta Rose, and moved to Ottawa. With the help of his wife, he managed to secure a military contract to provide marmalade to Canadian forces during WWII.  He was unable to source ingredients during wartime and reportedly had to adapt by making marmalade from cabbage.  He was still making commercial jams, from the basement of his home in Ottawa, when he died at age 73.

Drinkle died in his home in 1951 and his remains were interred at Waverly Ontario, his childhood home.  His body arrived there by train, unbeknownst to his remaining distant relatives, who were required to pay the freight before collecting the remains.  Today a large monument marks his grave.

'''Sir John George Davies''' [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]] (17 February 1846 – 12 November 1913), generally known as (Sir) George Davies, was a [[Tasmania]]n politician, newspaper proprietor and [[first-class cricket]]er.

Davies' Jewish father [[John Davies (publisher)|John Snr.]] and grandfather had been [[Penal transportation|transported]] to [[Australia]] as convicts and Davies was born in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] to John Snr. and Elizabeth Davies (née Ellis) following Davies Snr's release.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

The Davies family moved to Tasmania, where Davies Snr co-founded the ''[[The Mercury (Hobart)|Hobart Mercury]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', "Death of Sir George Davies", 13 November 1913, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and became a prominent citizen of [[Hobart]], including serving in the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Parliament of Tasmania'', "John Davies", http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/history/tasparl/davies70.htm Accessed 24 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies and his brother [[Charles Davies (Tasmanian politician)|Charles]] were educated at [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[The Hutchins School]] in Hobart, where he showed great promise as a sportsman.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;Boyer, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sporting career==
Davies' cricketing skills led him to play against the touring [[English cricket team in Australia in 1861–62|H.H. Stephenson's English side]] in 1862, aged 16, scoring six.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/134/134508.html E Stephenson's XI v HH Stephenson's XI Accessed 14 May 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to represent Tasmania in non-first-class matches throughout the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/2/2474/Other_matches.html |title=Other matches played by George Davies|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies made his first-class cricket debut for Tasmania against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] on 24 February 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1675.html |title=Victoria v Tasmania in 1870/71|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davies captained Tasmania, opened the batting and kept wicket. He was the only batsman from either side to reach double figures in each innings.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, pp. 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to work pressures and the small number of matches Tasmania were involved in, Davies only played seven first-class matches. Four of those matches came when he captained a Tasmanian team on a tour of the South Island of New Zealand in February 1884. He made his highest score of 42 on that tour, against [[Canterbury cricket team|Canterbury]] in Christchurch. His best bowling figures were two wickets for no runs against [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] in November 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/2/2474/2474.html |title=George Davies|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Logistics in World War I''' was the organising and delivery of supplies to the armed forces of [[World War I]]. 

== Initial stages of the war ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 104-0984A, Bei Etricourt, Truppen auf Landstraße.jpg|thumb|German supply train bottleneck in front of two provisional bridges near [[Étricourt-Manancourt|Étricourt]], France, during [[Operation Michael]], 24 March 1918]]
With the expansion of military [[conscription]] and [[Military reserve force|reserve]] systems in the decades leading up to the 20th century, the potential size of armies increased substantially, while the [[Industrial warfare|industrialization of firepower]] ([[bolt-action rifle]]s with higher rate-of-fire, larger and more artillery, plus [[machine gun]]s) was starting to multiply the potential amount [[munitions]] they required. Military logistical systems, however, continued to rely on 19th century technology.

The main method of transportation of supplies at the start of the war was still by [[horse]] due to the lack of available alternatives in 1914, similar to that of the inclusion of [[cavalry]] within the armed forces, and the fast pace of the war in the first part of the war. When [[World War I]] started, the capabilities of rail and horse-drawn supply were stretched to their limits.  As the war progressed it became increasingly difficult  to supply soldiers in the traditional way by horse and carriage due to conditions at the front. The supply routes became muddy and impassable, improvement to [[artillery]] on both sides and other tactics meant that supplies became increasingly delivered under cover of night and were considerably slowed down.

== Trench warfare and blockade of Germany ==
[[File:Imperial Russian artillery ammunition baskets WWI.jpg|thumb|right|Russian ammunition baskets for heavy artillery shells.  Supplying the artillery of WWI was a challenge which, for Britain, resulted in the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]].]]
However, as the war ground down into static trench warfare it became easier for armies to support their troops with the use of the [[railway]], especially for the artillery. This made the transportation of supplies easier and quicker to get from the factories to the front line. This did have problems of their own, as seen by the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]]. Where the stalemate of [[trench warfare]] took hold, special [[narrow gauge]] [[trench railways]] were built to extend the rail network to the front lines. The great size of the German Army proved too much for its railways to support except while immobile.&lt;ref&gt;Creveld, pp. 138–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Tactical successes like [[Operation Michael]] devolved into operational failures where logistics failed to keep up with the army's advance over shell-torn ground. 

On the seas, the British [[blockade of Germany]] kept a stranglehold on raw materials, goods, and food needed to support Germany's war efforts, and is considered one of the key elements in the eventual Allied victory in the war. On the Allied Side a huge producer of supplies was the [[United States of America]], meaning the supplies had to be transported over the Atlantic Ocean to England and France. At the same time, Germany's [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] showed the vulnerability of shipping lanes despite Allied [[naval superiority]]. This revolutionised how war shipping was conducted and saw the first use of military convoys to counter the threat caused by [[U-boat|German U-Boats]].

In June 1918 the Allies organized the Military Board of Allied Supply, which proved to be an invaluable mechanism for coordinating logistical requirements for armies working in close proximity during the final battles that autumn.  The Board’s report contains overviews of the logistical systems for the principal Allied armies.&lt;ref&gt;“[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000112005 Report of the Military Board of Allied Supply]” 2 vols. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

The trans-Atlantic distances and the American inexperience at large scale operations combined to make support of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) extraordinarily difficult.  Mass production of munitions, including cargo ships, did not reach full potential until near the end of the war.  In the meantime, the United States relied upon European allies for most weapons and upon Britain for shipping.  In France, the Americans built or improved ports, railroads, depots, and other facilities to move the supplies to the front.  Slowly the Americans learned the multiple functions associated with supporting a large-scale conflict, which allowed the AEF to operate as a independent force.  Experience gained in World War I proved invaluable during later conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Leo P.

==Biography==
Elizalde was born in [[Manila]] to José Joaquín Elizalde and Carmen Díaz Moreau. He was a brother of diplomat [[Joaquín Miguel Elizalde|Joaquin]] ("Mike"), Juan Miguel, Angel, [[Fred Elizalde|Federico]] ("Fred") and Carmenchu Elizalde.  

During the 1920s, he was nicknamed "Lizz" Elizalde, playing the [[clarinet]] and the [[saxophone]] alongside his brother Fred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/manuel-lizz-elizalde-mn0001484139|title=Manuel "Lizz" Elizalde biography|first=Eugene|last=Chadbourne|work=AllMusic|date=|access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was married to Mary Cadwallader and among the couple's children was [[Manuel Elizalde|Manuel "Manda" Elizalde Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/13/archives/tribesmens-mentor.html|title=Tribesman's Mentor|first=|last=|work=The New York Times|date=13 August 1970|access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
In 1936, he and his brothers established Elizalde &amp; Company, Inc. after acquiring the major businesses of [[Ynchausti y Compañía]], among them Ynchausti Shipping, [[Tanduay]], YCO Paints and Floor Wax, Rizal Cement, and the Central Azucarera de La Carlota and Central  Azucarera  de  Pilar (now Capiz Sugar Central) sugar refineries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Borja|first=Marciano R|title=Basques in the Philippines|year=2005|publisher=University of Nevada Press|location=Nevada|isbn=0-87417-590-9|pages=128–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After [[World War II]], Elizalde became president of the company after his brother Mike decided to step down from the position in order to focus on his diplomatic career.

In 1946, Elizalde and his brothers established [[Manila Broadcasting Company]] to acquire the radio stations [[DZRH|KZRH]] and [[DYRC|KYRC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB04136.pdf|title=H.B. 4136|first=|last=House of Representatives, Republic of the Philippines|date=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
From the 1920s to the 1930s, Elizalde was an avid [[polo]] player together with his brothers [[Joaquin Miguel Elizalde|Mike]], Juan Miguel and Angel. In January 1937, the Elizalde brothers inaugurated the Los Tamaraos Polo Club in [[Parañaque]] after resigning their memberships in the Manila Polo Club in protest to the rejection of the membership application of Manuel Nieto, [[aide-de-camp]] of Philippine President [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. The Elizalde brothers proposed and seconded Nieto's membership application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philippinediaryproject.wordpress.com/1936/03/24/march-24-1936/|title=Diary of Francis Burton Harrison, March 24, 1935|first=F.B.|last=Harrison|work=The Philippine Diary Project|date=|access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/polo-history-in-the-philippines/109284/|title=Polo history in the Philippines|first=|last=|work=The Manila Times|date=5 July 2014|access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a sports patron, he founded the [[YCO Painters|YCO]] and the original [[Tanduay Rhum Masters|Tanduay]] basketball teams.

'''Michael Bambang Hartono''' (born 2 October 1939 in [[Kudus, Kudus|Kudus]], [[Central Java]]), also known as '''Oei Gwie Siong''', is a [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese Indonesian]] billionaire heir and businessman. 

Michael and his brother [[Robert Budi Hartono|Robert Budi]] are the owners of [[kretek]] (clove cigarette) manufacturer [[Djarum]], which they inherited from their father [[Oei Wie Gwan]] upon his death in 1963. Growing the business to a large conglomerate including [[Bank Central Asia]], electronics, plantations and various properties, they became the richest in the country with Michael himself having a net worth in excess of $10 billion.

==Early life==
Michael Hartono was born on 2 October 1939 in the town of [[Kudus, Kudus|Kudus]], in [[Central Java]].&lt;ref name="tirto"&gt;{{cite news |title=Michael Hartono |url=https://tirto.id/m/michael-hartono-hX |accessdate=29 August 2018 |work=tirto.id |language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Oei Wie Gwan]], had purchased a small [[Kretek]] cigarette factory called ''Djarum Gramophon'' (lit: Gramophone needle) in April 1951, and renamed it to just ''Djarum''. In 1963, however, the factory burned down and shortly thereafter Oie Wie passed away, leaving Michael and his younger brother [[Robert Budi Hartono]] to inherit the factory.&lt;ref name="kisah"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Putra |first1=Idris Rusadi |title=Kisah Hartono bersaudara membangun kerajaan bisnis Djarum |url=https://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/kisah-hartono-bersaudara-membangun-kerajaan-bisnis-djarum.html |date=1 February 2014 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="djarum"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Djarum |url=http://www.djarum.com/world-of-djarum/history-of-djarum/ |publisher=Djarum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''multilateral trade negotiations''' (MTN) initially applied to negotiations between [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) member nations conducted under the auspices of the GATT and aimed at reducing tariff and nontariff trade barriers.  In 1995 the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) replaced the GATT as the administrative body.  A current round of multilateral trade negotiations was conducted in the [[Doha Development Agenda]] round.

Prior to the ongoing [[Doha Development Round]], eight GATT sessions took place: 

* 1st Round: Geneva Tariff Conference, 1947
* 2nd Round: Annecy Tariff Conference, 1949
* 3rd Round: Torquay Tariff Conference, 1950-51
* 4th Round: Geneva Tariff Conference, 1955-56
* 5th Round: Dillon Round, 1960-61
* 6th Round: Kennedy Round, 1963-67

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2477">The '''Paul E. Garber Award''' is given to [[Civil Air Patrol]] (CAP) [[Civil Air Patrol#Senior members|Senior Members]] who complete Level IV of the Senior Member Professional Development Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAPR 39-3 Award of CAP Medals, Ribbons, and Certificates|url=https://www.capmembers.com/media/cms/R039_003_83459660D4F44.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It recognizes those members who have dedicated themselves to leadership and personal development in the CAP.  This award was first given in 1964 and honors [[Paul E. Garber]].  Mr. Garber was a noted aviation pioneer, curator emeritus of the [[National Air and Space Museum]], and early champion of Civil Air Patrol.

Civil Air Patrol is the Auxiliary of the [[United States Air Force]]. CAP has a three-fold mission.  It includes emergency services, the cadet program, and aerospace education.  CAP professional development provides technical skills and leadership training to senior members age 18 and over to support CAP’s mission.  The program enables these adults to develop these skills while providing a vital public service to the US nation.

As the member progresses through the program, he or she completes five increasingly complex training levels.  Each level requires the member to become more involved in CAP activities, master skills in one of 23 technical areas, and develop leadership ability.  As he or she completes these levels, the member receives awards, chances for promotion, and selection for more important roles within CAP.

The fourth milestone is the Garber Award.  It is earned after receiving the [[Grover Loening Award]].  In addition, members must inform their communities about CAP. They must train fellow members in a variety of courses.  They must serve in command or leadership positions for at least two years.   Finally, they must complete CAP’s mid-level leadership course, Region Staff College, or approved equivalent.

Of CAP’s 35,000 senior members, less than 200 earn the Paul E. Garber Award annually.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}  Receipt of the award and completion of rank and time-in-grade requirements also makes the member eligible for promotion to CAP Major.

After receiving the Garber Award, participants may go on to the [[Gill Robb Wilson Award]].

'''Peter Schröcksnadel''' (born July 30, 1941 in Innsbruck) is an Austrian entrepreneur and since 1990 President of the Austrian Ski Federation (ÖSV), from 2009 to 2012 President of the [[European Ski Federation]] (ESF)&lt;ref name="orf-154773"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ungarin folgt Schröcksnadel als ESF-Chefin|periodical=sport.orf.at|publisher=|url=http://sport.orf.at/stories/2154773/|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-01-18|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=2012-12-05|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former vice president of the [[Austrian Olympic Committee]]. 

== Life ==
In Innsbruck, he completed his [[Matura]] at a Handelsakademie in 1959. He studied law. In 1964, he founded Sitour Austria in Innsbruck and produced panorama and slope marking boards as well as slope guidance systems ("signalisation touristique"). His second company, Feratel Media Technologies AG, founded in 1978, developed in the early 1990s panoramic image, live broadcast weather panorama television as a tourist marketing tool, which is broadcast by various television networks. At the same time, the company develops eTourism products for the European market.

From 1978 to 1990, Peter Schröcksnadel was an instructor for general skiing in the Austrian Schiverband and from 1987 to 1990 was vice president, and then president. In 1992, he was awarded the title of professor by the Federal Ministry of Science.

As a result of the doping scandal during the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], Schröcksnadel resigned from his post as Vice President of the Austrian Olympic Committee (ÖOC) the following year.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://spiegel.de/sport/sonst/0,1518,485410,00.html Doping im Wintersport: Ausschluss für Österreicher, Sperre für Langläufer]''. &lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], Russia, Peter Schröcksnadel spoke in a newspaper interview about the political discussions surrounding Russia's policy. He criticized a boycott of the games demanded by politicians, and was pleased that the Chancellor and the Minister of Sport of Austria wanted to visit the games. He did not want to judge the human rights violations in Russia, and advised athletes not to speak out politically. He interpreted the release of political prisoners as a positive impact of the Winter Olympics in Sochi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Würde keinem Sportler raten, sich politisch zu äußern"|periodical=Der Standard|publisher=|url=http://derstandard.at/1388650057170/Ich-wuerde-keinem-Sportler-raten-sich-politisch-zu-aeussern|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-11-28|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=2014-01-03|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schröcksnadel Group ==
In addition to his work as ÖSV President, Peter Schröcksnadel is Managing Director of four ÖSV subsidiaries, namely Austria Skiteam Handels und Beteiligungs GmbH, Austria Ski Nordic Event GmbH, Austria Ski WM and Großveranstaltungs GmbH and Austria Ski Veranstaltungs GmbH. The companies are among the most important organizers of major events and other winter tourism events in Austria.

He is also managing director of Sitour Management GmbH.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.firmenabc.at/sitour-marketing-gmbh_BOKl Sitour Marketing GmbH].'' &lt;/ref&gt;Today, the company operates in Austria with 30 employees worldwide and is represented in several countries in Europe, the USA and Japan .

{{Globalize|date=October 2010}}
In [[commercial law]], a '''principal''' is a person, [[Legal person|legal]] or [[Natural person|natural]], who authorizes an [[Agent (law)|agent]] to act to create one or more legal relationships with a [[:wikt:third party|third party]]. This branch of law is called [[Agency (law)|agency]] and relies on the [[common law]] proposition '''''qui facit per alium, facit per se''''' ([[Latin]] "he who acts through another, acts personally").

It is a parallel concept to [[vicarious liability]] and [[strict liability]] (in which one person is held liable for the acts or omissions of another) in [[criminal law]] or [[tort]]s.

==Concepts==
In a busy commercial world, the smooth flow of trade depends on the use of agents. This may be because in [[business entity|business entities]] such as:
*[[sole trader]]s, their ability to conduct business will always be limited unless other people are used to work on their behalf;
*a [[partnership]], the [[natural person]]s who are involved cannot be present to conduct business in multiple locations simultaneously, so they must rely on others to make agreements or deliver services on their behalf; or
*a [[corporation]] is only a [[Juristic person|legal entity]] or fictitious legal person and so can only act through the agency of human beings to get anything done.
In the majority of cases, it is impossible for agents to seek specific authority for every deal or detail within a deal. Agents must, of necessity, be allowed some degree of discretion in the conduct of routine transactions. But, for the purposes of ascribing legal responsibility to the Principal, when the Agent acts with actual or apparent authority, all the Agent's knowledge will be [[imputation (law)|imputed]] to the Principal. If Principals were allowed to hide behind their agents' own ignorance, mistakes or failures to communicate, a Principal could, by using an Agent, achieve a better result than if they acted personally. For example, if the particular deal turned out well, the Principal could adopt the transaction. But, if it turned out badly, the Principal could disavow it. Indeed, if not for imputation, there would be a [[perverse incentive]] to conduct business through Agents rather than personally. Consequently, the Principal cannot exploit ignorance to their advantage by instructing the Agent to withhold key information or by appointing an Agent known to be secretive.

This rule in favour of imputation relates to the duties an Agent owes a Principal, in particular the Agent's duty to communicate material facts to the Principal. Since the purpose of the law is to offer protection to Third Parties who have acted in [[good faith]], it is reasonable to allow them to believe that, in most cases, the Agents have fulfilled this duty. After all, the Principal selects the Agents and has the power to control their actions both through express instructions and incentives intended to influence their behaviour which will include laying down routines for how Agents should handle information, and the extent to which Agents will be rewarded for transmitting information of commercial value. The result is a form of strict liability in which the legal consequences of an Agent's acts or omissions are attributed to a Principal even when the Principal was without fault in appointing or supervising the Agent. Borrowing parallel concepts from Tort and [[Equity (law)|Equity]], this means that the Principal owes the Third Party a [[duty of care]] to ensure that the Agent is honest and efficient, and that a Principal is [[estoppel|estopped]] from denying that an Agent was authorised to act as they did.


==Summary of law==
There are three classes of Principal:
{| class="wikitable"
|+3 classes of principal
!Class
!Description
|-
|Disclosed
|at the time of the transaction made by the Agent with the Third Party, the latter knows that the person he is dealing with is acting as an Agent and also knows the Principal’s identity.
|-
|Partially disclosed
|at the time of the transaction, the Third Party knows that the person he is dealing with is acting as an Agent but does not know the Principal’s identity.
|-
|Undisclosed
|The person acting as an Agent represents they are acting on their own behalf and does not disclose the existence of the agency relationship. 
|}

===Authority===
For these purposes, the Principal must give, or be deemed to give, the Agent authority to act.
*Actual authority
:This arises where the Principal's words or conduct reasonably cause the Agent to believe they have been authorised to act. This may be expressed as a [[contract]] or implied because what is said or done make it reasonably necessary for the person to assume the powers of an Agent. If it is clear that the Principal gave actual authority to Agent, all the Agent's actions falling within the scope of the authority given bind the Principal. This results even if, having actual authority, the Agent in fact acts [[fraud]]ulently for his own benefit, unless the Third Party was aware of the Agent's personal agenda. If there is no contract but the Principal's words or conduct reasonably led the Third Party to believe that the Agent was authorised to act, or if what the Agent proposes to do is incidental and reasonably necessary to accomplish an actually authorised transaction or a transaction that usually accompanies it, then the Principal is bound.
*Apparent or [[ostensible authority]]
:If the Principal's words or conduct would lead a reasonable person in the Third Party’s position to believe that the Agent was authorised to act, say by appointing the Agent to a position which carries with it agency-like powers, those who know of the appointment are entitled to assume that there is apparent authority to do the things ordinarily entrusted to one occupying such a position. If a Principal creates the impression that an Agent is authorised but there is no actual authority, Third Parties are protected so long as they have acted reasonably. This is sometimes termed "Agency by [[Estoppel]]" or the "Doctrine of Holding Out", where the Principal is stopped from denying the grant of authority if Third Parties have changed their positions to their detriment in reliance on the representations made.
*Authority by virtue of a position held
:For example, [[partnership|partners]] have apparent authority to bind the other partners in the firm, their liability being joint and several, and in a [[corporation]], all executives and senior employees with decision-making authority by virtue of their declared position have apparent authority to bind the corporation.
Even if the Agent does act without authority, the Principal may ratify the transaction and accept liability on the transactions as negotiated. This may be express or implied from the Principal's behaviour, e.g. if the Agent has purported to act in a number of situations and the Principal has knowingly acquiesced, the failure to notify all concerned of the Agent's lack of authority is an implied ratification to those transactions and an implied grant of authority for future transactions of a similar nature.mithun
'''

===Liability===

====Agent to Principal====
If the Agent has acted without actual authority, but the Principal is nevertheless bound because the Agent had apparent authority, the Agent is liable to indemnify the Principal for any resulting loss or damage.

====Principal to Agent====
If the Agent has acted within the scope of the actual authority given, the Principal must indemnify the Agent for payments made during the course of the relationship whether the expenditure was expressly authorized or merely  necessary in promoting the Principal’s business.

====Third Party to Principal====
The Third Party is liable to the Principal on the terms of the agreement made with the Agent, unless the Principal was undisclosed and there is clear evidence that either the Agent or the Principal knew that the Third Party would not have entered into the agreement if they had known of the Principal's involvement.

===Duties===
The relationship between a Principal and an Agent is [[fiduciary duty|fiduciary]] which requires the Agent to be loyal to the Principal. This involves duties:
*not to accept any new obligations that are inconsistent with the duties owed to the Principal. Agents can represent the interests of more than one Principal, conflicting or potentially conflicting, only on the basis of full and timely disclosure or where the different agencies are based on a limited form of authority to prevent a situation where the Agent's loyalty to the any one of the multiple Principals is compromised. For this purpose, express clauses in the agreement signed by each Principal with the Agent may identify specific types or categories of activities that do not breach the duty of loyalty and so long as these exceptions are not unreasonable, they bind the Principals.
*not to make a private profit or unjustly enrich himself from the agency relationship. Principals usually include a power in their contract with the Agents allowing them to inspect the Agents' accounts if reasonable suspicion of improper behavior emerges.
In return, the Principal must make a full disclosure of all information relevant to the transactions that the Agent is authorized to negotiate and pay the Agent either the [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] or fee as agreed, or a reasonable fee if none were previously agreed on.

===Remedies against agent===
The principal has the following remedies against the agent for breaching his/her [[fiduciary duty]]:&lt;ref name="KubasekPPT"&gt;Slide 9 of [http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073524972/student_view0/chapter19/powerpoint_presentations.html Chapter 19 Powerpoint] for text {{cite book|last1=Kubasek|first1=Nancy|last2=Browne|first2=M. Neil|last3=Heron|first3=Daniel|last4=Dhooge|first4=Lucien|last5=Barkacs|first5=Linda|title=Dynamic Business Law: The Essentials|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0073524972|edition=2d|url=http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073524972/information_center_view0/table_of_contents.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kubasek"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kubasek|first1=Nancy|last2=Browne|first2=M. Neil|last3=Heron|first3=Daniel|last4=Dhooge|first4=Lucien|last5=Barkacs|first5=Linda|title=Dynamic Business Law: The Essentials|date=2016|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9781259415654|edition=3d|page=422|url=http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073524972/information_center_view0/table_of_contents.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constructive trust====
If the agent wrongfully holds property that should be owned or entitled to the principal, the principal can ask the court to deem it a [[constructive trust]]—that the agent is holding the property on behalf of the principal.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KubasekPPT"/&gt;

====Avoidance====

The principal can void contracts negotiated by an agent that breached his or her fiduciary duty.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KubasekPPT"/&gt;

====Indemnification====

The principal can sue the agent for liability caused by the agent's wrongful acts, i.e. if a third party obtained a judgment against the principal for wrongful acts caused by the agent, the principal can sue the agent to recover the loss.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KubasekPPT"/&gt;

====Negligence (for not following instructions)====

A principal can sue for the negligence of an agent who '''failed to follow instructions''', unless it was simply a failure to follow the principal's ''advice''.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;

===Undisclosed principal===
An '''Undisclosed principal''' is an unrevealed one, in a situation involving an undisclosed [[agency (law)|agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 563 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is "a person who uses an agent for his/her negotiations with a third party, often when the agent pretends to be acting for himself/herself." &lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=2188&amp;bold=%7C%7C%7C%7C Law.com definition]&lt;/ref&gt;  In a [[real estate]] transaction, this could be any "major party to a transaction, such as a seller or purchaser of property," who wishes to remain anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realestateagent.com/glossary/real-estate-glossary-show-term-1828-undisclosed-principal.html Real Estate Agent.com web page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some taxing authorities have created [[Law|rules]] regarding tax liability for actions of an undisclosed principal.&lt;ref&gt;The Department of Revenue of the State of Illinois v. Taxpayer, ST 97-12, found at [http://www.revenue.state.il.us/legalinformation/hearings/st/st97-12.pdf State of Illinois government web site].&lt;/ref&gt;  The undisclosed agency may also affect [[tort]] [[Legal liability|liability]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wahab Janitorial Services v. P.M. Group Mgt.'', 161 Ohio App.3d 632, 2007-Ohio-3037 (2005), found at [http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/newpdf/1/2005/2005-Ohio-3037.pdf Pdf file of ''Wahab Janitorial Services'' case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230191847/http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/newpdf/1/2005/2005-ohio-3037.pdf |date=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Termination===
The Principal can terminate an Agent's authority at any time without having to give notice. If the trust between the Agent and Principal has broken down, it is not reasonable to allow the Principal to remain at risk in any transactions that the Agent might conclude during a period of notice.

==Economic analysis==
{{main|Principal–agent problem}}

The analysis of principal-agent relationships is an important topic in economics. The main focus of analysis is on the [[information asymmetry]] between the agent, who is assumed to be well informed, and the principal who may not be.

The '''Public Services''' of [[Sri Lanka]] are a series of services groups that provide specialized professional services to the [[Government of Sri Lanka]]. These are government employees who carry out public duties, however they are not elected officials. The most senior of these is the [[Sri Lanka Administrative Service]] which is the country's permanent [[bureaucracy]]. The Sri Lankan Government is the largest employer in the country and the public services are often criticized as overstaffed and inefficient.&lt;ref name="SLDOS"/&gt;

Their members are selected by competitive examination and promotions are made by the [[Civil service commission|Public Service Commission]].

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
In [[company (law)|corporate law]], a '''stock certificate''' (also known as '''certificate of stock''' or '''share certificate''') is a legal document that certifies [[ownership]] of a specific number of [[share (finance)|share]]s or [[stock]] in a [[corporation]]. Historically, certificates may have been required to evidence entitlement to [[dividend]]s, with a receipt for the payment being endorsed on the back; and the original certificate may have been required to be provided to effect the transfer of the shareholding. Over time, these functions have been rendered redundant by statutory schemes to streamline the administrative burden on corporations, and to facilitate and streamline trading on a [[stock exchange]]. For example, most jurisdictions now impose an obligation on corporations to pay dividends to shareholders registered at a relevant point of time without the need to produce the share certificate as proof of entitlement and the certificate is no longer required to be produced with a transfer of a shareholding. In some jurisdictions today, the issue of paper stock certificates may be dispensed with, at least in some circumstances, and many corporations now provide a '''holding statement''' in lieu of a share certificate for each parcel of shares owned.

Most jurisdictions now require corporations to maintain records of ownership or transfers of shareholdings, and do not permit share certificates to be issued to [[bearer instrument|bearer]].

==History==
Ruben Schalk, history student at the [[Universiteit Utrecht]], discovered (2010) the so far oldest share certificate in the world in the [[Westfries Archief]] in [[Hoorn]]. The certificate dates from 9 September 1606 and was issued by the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]]-chamber [[Enkhuizen]]. It was sold to Pieter Hermanszoon Boode. The second page records the payments of dividend.

In the United States and other countries, electronic registration is supplanting the stock certificate, with both public and private companies no longer being required to issue paper certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Todd Miller|url=https://www.capshare.com/blog/why-private-companies-dont-need-to-issue-stock-certificates/|title=Why Private Companies Don’t Need To Issue Stock Certificates|date=25 September 2015|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States over 420 of the 7,000-plus publicly traded securities do not issue paper certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt Krantz|publisher=USA Today|date=25 May 2010|accessdate=7 September 2010|title= Electronic records are replacing paper stock certificates |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/markets/2010-05-25-certificates19_ST_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States' [[Central Securities Depository]], the [[Depository Trust Company|DTC]], has continued to promote efforts to completely eliminate paper stock certificates, a process called [[dematerialization (securities)|dematerialization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtcc.com/news/2013/march/12/full_dematerialization.aspx/|title=DTCC Proposes Steps to Move Ahead on Full Dematerialization of Physical Securities|date=12 March 2013|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries around the world have adopted similar initiatives with many countries setting deadlines for statutory dematerialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/financial-markets/docs/certainty/background/30_8_5_martinez-calcerrada_en.pdf/|title=Note On Statutory Dematerialisation Across the European Union|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brokers may charge up to $500 for issuing a paper certificate, though this fee can be avoided by either holding share in [[Street name securities|street name]] (in the United States street name securities are securities held electronically in the account of a stockbroker, similar to a bank account) or registering shares directly with the [[stock transfer agent]] and having them issue the certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt Krantz|publisher=USA Today|date=10 June 2010|accessdate=7 September 2010|title=Free paper stock certificates? It's possible but does take work |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/columnist/krantz/2010-05-25-paper-stock-certificates_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

Another alternative to both paper and electronic registration is the use of paper-equivalent electronic stock certificates. Forty-seven states have enacted legislation equivalent to the [[Uniform Electronic Transactions Act]], which formalizes equivalency for [[electronic signature]]s "in writing" requirements. This, together with the enactment of legislation permitting the use of "[[facsimile]]" signatures on certificates (such as in §158 of the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]]), has given rise to [[software as a service]] technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Connie Loizos|publisher=PeHUB|title=Cofounded by Manu Kumar, eShares Aims to (Finally) Digitize Stock and Options Certificates|url=http://www.pehub.com/2013/03/06/cofounded-manu-kumar-eshares-aims-finally-digitize-stock-options-certificates/|accessdate=13 June 2013|date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for private companies to create, issue and manage paper-equivalent electronic stock certificates.

In [[Sweden]], share certificates have been largely abolished, people using electronic shares instead (which are either registered in the share owner's name or in the share owner's broker's name). Share certificates may exist in Sweden, but only if the shares are not listed on any stock exchange in Sweden, and the availability of share certificates has nothing to do with voting in shareholders' general meetings.

Sometimes a shareholder with a stock certificate can give a [[Proxy voting|proxy]] to another person to allow them to vote the shares in question. Similarly, a shareholder without a share certificate may often give a proxy to another person to allow them to vote the shares in question. Voting rights are defined by the corporation's charter and corporate law.

Stock certificates are generally divided into two forms:  registered stock certificates and [[bearer stock certificate]]s.  A registered stock certificate is normally only evidence of title, and a record of the true holders of the shares will appear in the stockholder's register of the corporation.

A bearer stock certificate, as its name implies is a [[bearer instrument]], and physical possession of the certificate entitles the holder to exercise all legal rights associated with the stock.  Bearer stock certificates are becoming uncommon:  they were popular in [[offshore financial centre|offshore jurisdiction]]s for their perceived confidentiality, and as a useful way to transfer beneficial title to assets (held by the corporation) without payment of [[stamp duty]].  International initiatives have curbed the use of bearer stock certificates in offshore jurisdictions, and tend to be available only in onshore financial centres, although they are rarely seen in practice.

==Legal characterization of a stock certificate==
A stock certificate represents a legal proprietary interest in the common stock (in the sense of the general fund) or assets of the issuer corporation. The certificate evidences a [[chose in action]] against the issuer to collect dividends and usually to influence the issuer through voting pursuant to the issuer's [[charter]] and [[bylaws]], which are often implied or incorporated by reference as terms on the face of the certificate.

Stockholder rights are subject to the solvency requirements of issuer's general creditors and to any terms and conditions validly placed upon the face of the stock certificate which are part of the total agreement between the particular stockholder and the issuer.

Stock certificates are transferred as negotiable or quasi-negotiable instruments by indorsement and delivery, and issuer charters typically require that transfers must be registered with the issuer (usually via the issuer's transfer agent) in order for the transferee to join as a member of the corporation. Registration of transfer is a type of [[novation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/mulr/vol5/iss2/6|title=The Uniform Stock Transfer Act |first= Clarence G. |last=Ehrle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are old company research websites that can determine, for a fee, whether or not an old stock certificate or bond certificate has collectible or redeemable value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldcompany.com oldcompany.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

In the book, Johansson argues that innovation comes from diverse industries, cultures, and disciplines when they all intersect, bringing ideas from one field into another.&lt;ref name=WiredWOW/&gt; He also recommends assembling diverse teams of people to collaborate on innovation.&lt;ref name=TheBGlobSValley&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dabscheck|first1=David|title=Silicon Valley needs more foxes|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/09/20/for-innovation-silicon-valley-needs-more-foxes/VhYrFOY43orE2VmSDQ5sNI/story.html|accessdate=5 June 2015|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the book is derived from the [[House of Medici|Medici Dynasty]], an [[Italy|Italian]] banking family that came to power in the 14th century. The family's wealth was able to support artists that led to [[The Renaissance]].&lt;ref name=WiredWOW/&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2015}}{{unreliable source?|date=July 2015}} The book looks at examples of how Renaissance painters, sculptors, poets, philanthropists, scientists, philosophers, financiers, and architects, shaped historical eras of innovation.&lt;ref name=Buseinss2CommunityDebunking&gt;{{cite news|last1=Susco|first1=Darlene|title=Debunking 5 Myths of Innovation|url=http://www.business2community.com/business-innovation/debunking-5-myths-of-innovation-01238231|accessdate=5 June 2015|publisher=Business2Community|date=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Medici family did not intend the Renaissance, but contributed to it with what Johansson coins as the "Medici Effect."&lt;ref name=WiredWOW/&gt;

The book became the foundation for the "Medici Effect", a term that describes contributions of [[disruptive innovation]] from people who have no experience in an industry.&lt;ref name=WiredWOW/&gt; An example from the book includes Charles Darwin being a geologist and collecting a number of bird species from the [[Galápagos Islands]]. Darwin kept poor notes of his collection and returned the birds and notes over to [[John Gould]] upon his return.&lt;ref name=HBSchoolCreateME&gt;{{cite web|title=Create the Medici Effect|url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/4376.html|website=Harvard Business School|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould was an expert [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] and initially dismissed the birds as being normal. Gould later discovered that each species was in fact distinct.&lt;ref name=HBSchoolCreateME/&gt; The example from the book shows how Darwin, without the knowledge of ornithology, could contribute to the field without having the training or knowledge.&lt;ref name=HBSchoolCreateME/&gt;

'''Valeriy Ivanovich Tereshchenko''' (June 13, 1901&amp;nbsp;– September 28, 1994) was a [[Russian people|Russian]]−[[Soviet]] academic and writer in the fields of [[management]].

==History==
He was born in [[Ekaterinodar]] (now&amp;nbsp;– [[Krasnodar]]), [[Imperial Russia]], the son of deputy district judge. In Ekaterinodar he graduated from high school and conservatory, and in [[Prague]] graduated from the Department of Economics of the [[Czech Technical University]] and Institute for Agricultural Cooperation, where he taught in the latter 1920s.

===American period===
In 1930 moved to the United States, and graduated from [[Columbia University]] in New York. Later he became a professor at Columbia, where he taught management courses.

He worked in the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], at a Wall Street firm, and was a counsellor of the American businessman [[Roswell Garst]].

In 1937, sponsored by the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], Tereshchenko organized and led a large (160 employees) research project to study the world's literature on [[cooperatives]], which was published 12 languages. The work was conducted in close collaboration with the [[Co-operative League of America]], the [[International Cooperative Alliance]] in London, the International Labour Office in Geneva, and the Rockefeller Committee for Relations with South America. The [[Library of Congress]] assessed  the materials collected by project as ‘the most complete in the world’ at that time. The Fundamental Project Edition 'Summaries of  laws on cooperatives in the U.S.’ was used to revise the cooperative laws in some states. In this regard, in April 1940 Valeriy Tereshchenko was invited to Committee of the Senate on cooperatives legislation.

He along with other employees of the project took part in the establishment of initial economic ties between the U.S. and the [[Republic of China (1942−1949)]].

Before the end of [[World War II]], the scientist was elected to the Executive Committee of the International Cooperative postwar reconstruction (NY). He participated in the preparation the United Nations Conferences on Food and Agriculture in Atlantic City and Hot Springs.

In the 1940s he was invited to organize a section on cooperative in the Latin American Institute in Boston, he was initiator of the first ever visit delegation of cooperators South America to the United States.

===Soviet period===
After the [[Second World War]] Tereshchenko came to the [[USSR]] for business trips, to help to establish trade and economic ties with the U.S.  In 1946 he was chief economist UNRRA in Ukraine.

Returning to the [[Soviet Union]]−[[Ukraine]], and lived in Kiev since 1963. Here he worked in a number of research institutes&amp;nbsp;– of Ministry of Agricultural Economics and of the [[Ukrainian Academy of Science]], taught at the University of Kiev.

He was given an honorary award by [[UNESCO]], and awarded an honorary diploma by the [[Missouri Writers' Guild]] in the U.S.

Valeriy Ivanovich Tereshchenko died September 28, 1994, buried in Kiev, the [[Baikove Cemetery]].

==Works==
He is author of over 170 books, papers and articles in periodical on the management problems, which were printed in the United States, Argentina, Bulgaria, India, Canada, Germany, Peru, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland. In 1970 a Moscow company published a reduced version of the multi-volume American "Executive Leadership Course" (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1963) edited by Valeriy Tereshchenko.

He was a lecturer, with thousands of public lectures given in the U.S., Europe, and the Soviet Union. His later works included ‘The choice problem: policy of research priorities in the West’, ‘The science of management’, and ‘All about cooperation’, which was written when he was almost 90&amp;nbsp;years of age and published in Kiev .

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Willihaller.jpg|miniatur|200px|Willi Haller during the Flexitime Development]] --&gt;
'''Wilhelm "Willi" Haller''' (1935–2004) was a [[Swabia]]n businessman and [[Social entrepreneurship|social entrepreneur]] and is considered the father of [[Flexitime]]  of Interflex Datensysteme.

==Life==

As an apprentice with [[Messrs Hengstler]], a German manufacturer of electromechanical counters, Haller became aware that the fixed concepts in organizations could not live up to the needs of the developments in the working world.

In 1964, he went with his family to New York where, together with Paul Buser, he founded the Hengstler subsidiary [[Hecon Corporation]] and, among other things, invented the key counter, which gained a US patent in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3441719.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/patents/about?id=AKMtAAAAEBAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 1960s, he returned to [[Germany]] and began to get involved with making working hours flexible and developed concepts for flexible working hours, variable working hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Allan|last2=Gadon|first2=Herbert|title=Alternative Work Schedules: Integrating Individual and Organizational Needs|url=https://www.questia.com/read/94242515/alternative-work-schedules-integrating-individual|year=1978|publisher=Longman {{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}} |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and annual working hours.

Based on industrial counters, Haller developed the first time-recording equipment without which, realization of flexible working hours would not have been possible. This equipment made it possible, for the first time, to record the actual time that an employee worked and not just the beginning and end times of the working day. This was revolutionary in the 1960s.
To reach a wide public with his flexible working hours concepts and to make them popular, Haller created the Swabian / English slogan 'I laik Gleitzeit' (I like Flexitime),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit-zutritt.eu/flextimer_1.html Produkte&lt;!-- Automatisch generierter titel --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328044601/http://www.zeit-zutritt.eu/flextimer_1.html |date=2012-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which became the subject of discussion for many and was seen as [[bumper stickers]] on many cars.

His ideas and concepts caused him to be known as the "father of Flexitime" and led to the discussion on making working hours flexible be discussed across the then [[West Germany]], and with time to find more and more implementation. Haller advocated "three for two" job sharing to combat unemployment in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.computerwoche.de/a/eine-initiative-gegen-die-arbeitslosigkeit,1195779|title=Eine Initiative gegen die Arbeitslosigkeit|date=5 May 1978|work=Computerwoche|language=German|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His advice was in demand as a Flexitime expert, not only in Germany but also worldwide.

In the course of this development, Haller started to design the first computer system worldwide from which a little later the first PC-based time recording equipment for SME's (small to medium-sized businesses) were developed. In their basic mode of operation, these systems met the standards of all time recording systems today. Many other products and patents can be attributed to Haller's inventions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In order to achieve his goals faster and better and to give the employees a share in the success, Haller founded the company Interflex Datensysteme with three others of like mind which continually developed to become European market leader (it was later taken over by [[Ingersoll Rand]]). Haller built his organization on the basis of progressive management concepts. Employee motivation played a central role in this. The idea was that one third of profits should be shared each by investors, employees and charitable projects. A novelty for that time was the active involvement of employees in decision making processes.

Haller never saw himself as the boss but rather as part of a team, yet he was nevertheless a recognized and competent CEO. He was able to make his ideas understood and related them to others, inspiring and exciting his employees, winning them for a shared vision, and thus using their knowledge potential for the organization. It was extremely important for Haller for work to be fun.

Willi Haller left his company in the 1980s and worked as a consultant and coach in companies, trade unions, institutions and social organizations. He founded a number of social projects, including the "Lebens House“&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebenshaus-alb.de/magazin/002480.html With his visions he created new projects and was able to enthuse others such as the | Lebenshaus Schwäbische Alb&lt;!-- Automatisch generierter titel --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Nudel House“.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/1995/02/Spaghetti_von_Hand?page=1 Spaghetti von Hand | Länderspiegel | ZEIT ONLINE&lt;!-- Automatisch generierter titel --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nudelhaus.com/6468.html Nudelhaus Trossingen - italienische Feinkostenwaren - Wir über uns&lt;!-- Automatisch generierter titel --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was guest speaker at universities and management seminars&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070217051525/http://www.biberach.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Aktuelles/Files/Broschuere.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in television shows.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvprogramme.net/view_tag.php?tag=1985-02-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Haller was a radical thinker, he also had an influence on leading managers because he was not only charismatic but also pragmatic and logical in his argumentation. He is the author of a number of books and many articles about management, economy and theological themes. He saw himself as the student of the philosopher [[Martin Buber]], whose influence is apparent in Haller's book ''Das Dunkle Feuer'' demonstrated in this translation of an extract:

{{quote|We overlook, and too often suppress, the fact that [[salvation]] is actually to be discovered in the shadows. As in the conversion of seed to fruit, to use one of Jesus' examples, the darkness of the earth and its apparent destruction is decisive so salvation apparently grows mainly from a suffering experience within oneself and the environment. But this has nothing to do with the asceticism or self-affliction which makes us pull a face and adorn a bitter countenance but rather with a way to freedom; releasing man, creeping on all fours in internal and external dependency, to the glorious freedom of the Children of God and the making of us as upright human beings. This way leads to the wilderness, down into hell, into the caverns, into the dark lap of Mother Earth, where wheat corn dies and from which only thus fruit can be born.&lt;ref&gt;Das dunkle Feuer, Oberursel, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Haller's ideas continue to be a source of influence even after his death, including in the work of the  [[International Leadership and Business Society]], which has set as its aim the humanizing of work.

In [[Australia]], 35% of all workers are casual or contract employees who are not paid for [[sick leave]] or [[annual leave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brw.com.au/p/leadership/workforce_casualisation_the_discussion_e6DEzUdUr5NFkzQCaEjhOJ|title = Workforce casualisation: the discussion we have been avoiding|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], 53% of academics teaching or doing research in British universities manage on some form of insecure, non-permanent contract, ranging from short-term contracts that typically elapse within nine months, to those paid by the hour to give classes or mark essays and exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/16/universities-accused-of-importing-sports-direct-model-for-lecturers-pay|title = The new world of work: Universities accused of 'importing Sports Direct model' for lecturers' pay |date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2645">'''Étienne Léandri''' (1915–1995) was an intermediary close to [[Charles Pasqua]]. He was part of the French Connection and Corsica Mafia organisation. He took part in the negotiations concerning many important international contracts, and represented, among others, the interests of [[Elf Aquitaine|Elf]], [[Thomson CSF]] and [[Dumez]].

==Entrepreneur==
Leandri commercialized "Gazogene", the burning of wood or charcoal to power automobiles, using a special apparatus. This method of powering autos had been developed at the turn of the 19th, 20th century but during the Second World War Leandri built a factory in Nice to retrofit automobiles formerly running on petrol and to produce new automobiles with the gazogene apparatus attached.   
&lt;ref&gt;Conroy, Mary Schaeffer, The Cosmetics Baron You've Never Heard Of: E. Virgil Neal and Tokalon, 3rd Edition,(Altus History, 2014), pp. 329-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Businessman==
During the war, he was a business associate of the American pharmaceutical and perfume manufacturer, [[E. Virgil Neal]], of Tokalon;&lt;ref&gt;Conroy, (2009), pp.184-225, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to some accounts, Léandri had become Director of Tokalon by 1944.&lt;ref&gt;"Étienne Léandri was said to be Director of Tokalon by 1944. However, it is impossible to prove or disprove his [Léandri's] story about acquiring control over Tokalon in France…" (Conroy, 2009, p.212).&lt;/ref&gt;

Léandri was involved in various [[political scandal]]s, such as the [[Sofremi affair]], for which Pasqua has been indicted, and the affair concerning the moving of the headquarters of the [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]]-[[Alsthom|Alsthom Transport]] firms (for which Pasqua has also been indicted). In 1994 the second affair concerning Alstom generated a commission of 5.2 million Francs (790,000 Euros) paid by Pasqua to Étienne Léandri.&lt;ref name="Huma"&gt;[http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2007-02-21/2007-02-21-846350 Pasqua : l’étau se resserre], ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 21 February 2007 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
